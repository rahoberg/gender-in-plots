# gender-in-plots

The purpose of the project is to look at gender disparities in terms of plot descriptions of movies and other stories on Wikipedia. 

## Figures

In the figures folder are several ECDFs (Empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions) for the distribution of counts for male vs female pronouns in certain categories. There are also a few scatter plots illustrating the joint distribution. Finally, there is a figure representing the difference in male vs female pronouns in movies from 1990-2018. Perhaps hopeful that the difference is decreasing, but still has a long way to go!

## Source Code

The code used to extract the plots and also to analyze the gender disparities can be found in source. The code can be easily modified to extract plots from any category on Wikipedia.
