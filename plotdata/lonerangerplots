 In 1865, Captain Mark Smith of the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] leads a band of [[deserter]]s to conquer [[Texas]] and rule it as a [[dictator]]. In one of his first actions, he captures and assumes the identity of Texas' new Finance Commissioner, Colonel Marcus Jeffries, after having the real man murdered. When a contingent of [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] enters the territory, Snead, one of Smith's men, leads them into an ambush by Smith's "troopers". The Rangers are apparently wiped out, although one injured survivor is left.  The survivor, nursed back to health by Tonto, swears to avenge the massacre and defeat "Colonel Jeffries" and his men.  When he is not operating as the Ranger, he appears under an assumed identity as one of a group of Texans resisting Smith's rule.  Smith, through a henchman, has narrowed the field of suspects down to five specific members of the resistance.  One of these five, Allen King, Bob Stuart, Bert Rogers, Dick Forrest, and Jim Clark, actually is the Ranger, but only Tonto, and the other four Texans, know which one it is.  Together, they operate as an effective team attempting to end Smith's rule.

The Lone Ranger (2013 film)
  In 1933, a boy named Will who idolizes the legendary [[Lone Ranger]] encounters the elderly [[Comanche]] [[Tonto]] in a [[sideshow]] at a [[San Francisco]] fair. Tonto [[frame story|proceeds to recount]] his experiences with that [[Old West]] adventurer.  In 1869, lawyer John Reid returns home to Colby, [[Texas]], via the uncompleted [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]], managed by railroad tycoon Latham Cole. Unknown to Reid, the train is also carrying Tonto and outlaw Butch Cavendish, who is being transported for his [[hanging]] after being captured by Dan Reid, John's [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] brother. Cavendish's gang rescues Butch and derails the train. Tonto is subsequently jailed. Dan deputizes John as a Texas Ranger, and with six others they go after the Cavendish gang.  Cavendish's men ambush and kill their pursuers. Cavendish slays Dan with his [[dagger]] and [[Cannibalism|devours his heart]] as revenge for his imprisonment. Tonto, who has escaped from jail, comes across the dead men and buries them. However, a white [[spirit]] [[horse]] awakens John as a "spirit walker", and Tonto explains John cannot be killed in battle. Tonto also tells him Collins, one of the Rangers, betrayed Dan and is working with Cavendish. As John is thought to be dead, he wears a mask to protect his identity from enemies. Tonto gives John a silver [[bullet]] made from the fallen Rangers' badges and tells him to use it on Cavendish, whom he believes to be a mystical beast called a [[wendigo]].  At a [[brothel]] Collins recently visited, Red Harrington informs the two about Dan and Collins' fight over a cursed silver rock. Meanwhile, Cavendish's men, disguised as Comanches, raid frontier settlements. John and Tonto arrive after raiders abduct Dan's widow and son, Rebecca and Danny. Regretting his earlier actions, Collins attempts to help mother and child escape, but is shot dead by Cole, who rescues them. Claiming the raiders are hostile Comanches, Cole announces the continued construction of the railroad and dispatches [[United States Cavalry|US Cavalry]] Captain Jay Fuller to [[Genocide|wipe out the Comanches]].  A Comanche tribe captures John and Tonto after the pair finds railroad tracks in Native territory. The leader tells John of Tonto's past: As a boy, Tonto had rescued Cavendish and another man from near-death and later showed them a [[mountain]] full of [[silver]] ore in exchange for a [[pocket watch]]. The men murdered the tribe to keep the location a secret, leaving Tonto with great guilt which led to him believing the two were wendigos.  Tonto and John escape as the cavalry attack the Comanche. At the silver mine, the duo captures Cavendish. Tonto demands John use the silver bullet to kill Cavendish, but John refuses. Upon returning Cavendish to Cole and Fuller's custody, Cole is revealed to be Cavendish's partner and brother. Fuller, fearful of being labeled a [[war criminal]] for slaughtering the tribe, sides with Cole. Rebecca is held hostage, and John is returned to the mine to be executed. Tonto rescues him and the two flee. Realizing Cole is too powerful to be taken down lawfully and regretful since his arrogance in ignoring Tonto led to the mass slaughter of the Comanches and the kidnapping of his loved ones, John dons the mask again.  At [[Promontory, Utah|Promontory Summit]], during the railroad's [[golden spike|union ceremony]], Cole reveals his true plan: to take control of the railroad company and use the mined silver to gain more power. John and Tonto steal [[nitroglycerin]] and use it to destroy a railroad bridge. With Red's help, Tonto steals the train with the silver, and Cole, Cavendish and Fuller pursue him in a second train on which Rebecca and Dan Jr. are being held captive. On horseback, John pursues both trains. After a furious chase and fights on both trains, Cavendish and Fuller are killed, Rebecca and Dan Jr. are rescued, and Cole drowns while being buried beneath the silver ore after the train plunges off the severed bridge and into the river below, killing him.  The town recognize John as a hero and offers him a law-enforcement position. John declines, and he and Tonto ride off. Back in 1933, Will questions the truth of the story. Tonto gives him a silver bullet and tells him to decide for himself, and then departs.
