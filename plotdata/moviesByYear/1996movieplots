101 Dalmatians (1996 film)
 [[File:Glenn Close Wig And Costume Fitting For 101 Dalmatians.png|thumb|right|Close in costume for her role as Cruella de Vil]] [[Americans|American]] [[video game]] designer Roger Dearly lives with his pet [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] Pongo in [[London]]. One day, Pongo sets his eyes on a beautiful female dalmatian named Perdy. After a frantic chase through the streets of London that ends in [[St. James's Park]], Roger discovers that Pongo likes Perdy. Her owner, Anita Campbell-Green falls in love with Roger when they meet. They both fall into the lake as a result of their dogs chasing each other, but they return to Roger's home and Anita accepts his proposal. They get married along with Perdy and Pongo. Anita works as a [[fashion design]]er at the House of de Vil. Her boss, the pampered and very glamorous [[Cruella de Vil]], has a deep passion for fur, going so far as to have a [[Taxidermy|taxidermist]], Mr Skinner, skin a [[white tiger]] at the [[London Zoo]] to make it into a rug for her. Anita, inspired by her Dalmatian, designs a coat made with spotted fur. Cruella is intrigued by the idea of making garments out of actual Dalmatians, and finds it amusing that it would seem as if she was wearing Anita's dog.  Anita soon discovers that Perdy is [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] and is then informed by Nanny that she (Anita) is, too, much to her shock. Some time later, Cruella visits their home and expresses contempt upon meeting Roger. Her initial disgust at them having a baby turns to excitement when she finds out Perdy is expecting too. Several weeks later, she returns when a litter of 15 puppies are born and offers Roger and Anita £7,500 for them, but they refuse. Enraged, Cruella dismisses Anita and vows revenge against her and Roger. One winter evening, she has her henchmen, Jasper and Horace break into their home and steal the puppies, while Roger and Anita are walking in the park with Pongo and Perdy. Along with 84 other dalmatians that were previously stolen, they deliver them to her ancient [[country estate]], De Vil Mansion. Jasper and Horace also asks Skinner to kill and skin them to create her coat.  With the family devastated at the loss of their puppies, Pongo uses the [[twilight bark]] to carry the message via the dogs and other animals of Britain, while Roger and Anita notify the [[Metropolitan Police]]. A dog who had witnessed the stolen puppies follows Jasper and Horace to the mansion, and finds all of them inside, before helping them escape under the duo's noses. They make their way to a nearby farm, where they are later joined by Pongo and Perdy. Cruella arrives at the mansion and soon discovers what has happened. Angry with the thieves' failure, she decides to carry out the job herself, while Jasper and Horace attempt to search for them also. After several mishaps, Jasper and Horace discover nearby police on the hunt for Cruella and her henchmen and hand themselves in, joining Skinner who was beaten earlier while trying to kill Lucky (one of the 15 puppies), who had been left behind. Meanwhile, Cruella tracks the puppies to the farm where they are hiding and tries to retrieve them. However, the animals outwit her, cause her to fall into a vat of [[molasses]] and get thrown through a window into a pig pen. Shortly afterwards, the fleeing dalmatians (including Lucky) are found and sent home via the [[Suffolk Constabulary]], while those looking for Cruella arrive at the farm to arrest her. In the police van, she belittles Jasper, Horace, and Skinner for their incompetence before they are sprayed by a [[skunk]] which she had mistaken for her bag. Pongo, Perdy and their puppies are reunited with Roger and Anita.  After being informed that the remaining 84 puppies have no home to go to, as they have not yet been claimed by their original owners, they decide to adopt them, bringing the total to 101. Roger designs a successful video game featuring dalmatian puppies as the [[protagonist]]s and Cruella as the [[villain]] and they move to the countryside with their millions. Roger and Anita have a baby daughter, and a year later the puppies have grown up with puppies of their own.

Lee injects Becky with a tranquilizer then shoots Roy in the head. Lee and Dosmo then drive to an abandoned area of [[Mulholland Drive]], where Lee shoots Dosmo and blows up the car in order to set Dosmo up as the fall guy for the murder. Lee flees the scene with his girlfriend Helga.  Dosmo was wearing a bulletproof vest and survived the shooting and car explosion. He seeks shelter at the mansion of wealthy art dealer Allan Hopper, where he takes Hopper and his assistant, Susan Parish, hostage. Dosmo is unaware that Hopper has called his sister, Audrey Hopper, a nurse, to come to the house. On her way, Audrey picks up Teddy Peppers, a down-and-out TV producer contemplating suicide.  Meanwhile, Becky awakens and discovers Roy's body in bed beside her. She runs from her house and flags down two detectives, young, ambitious Wes Taylor and cynical veteran Alvin Strayer, who are driving by. Although he is sympathetic, Wes begins to suspect that Becky knows more than she is saying. Becky, who had hired Lee and Dosmo to kill Roy for $30,000, was unaware that they would kill Roy in her own house. Lee goes back to the house to get the money, encounters homicide detectives Creigton and Valenzuela working the crime scene, and kills them both. Wes decides to return to the crime scene to see if he can offer any insight on the case. Masquerading as one of the detectives, Lee lures Wes outside, intending to kill him.  Becky and Helga get into an argument which escalates into a fight. Becky shoots Helga in a confused scuffle and escapes. Helga finds her way to Becky's house, where Lee has knocked Wes unconscious. Lee reluctantly decides to kill Helga instead of taking her to the hospital, concluding that her wound is too severe to be treated, but his gun jams. He turns to retrieve Wes's gun but finds that Helga has escaped and has flagged down a passing car containing Dosmo and his hostages. Susan jumps out of the car and tries to help the dying Helga, but Helga dies on the roadside.  Wes is caught in the  middle of a shoot out between Dosmo and Lee, and is shot in the legs. Just before Lee can kill Dosmo, Teddy shoots Lee, killing him.  A grateful Wes allows Dosmo to take the $30,000 and escape with Susan. The following day, Teddy shows up to an anniversary party that Audrey is attending. As Susan and Dosmo drive down a highway, Dosmo contemplates using the money to start a pizzeria in Brooklyn; Susan smiles and he kisses her.

While he examines the baby, he notices that the girl scratches her legs. He gives her advice on what to do to help with her legs and cure her acne. The doctor diapers the baby and gives her back to her sister. She asks if the baby is going to die. He says no and leaves with the excuse that he has to visit other patients in the neighborhood and instructs the girl to tell her mother that he will be back at 6 pm. She wants to come with him, but he passes over the offer with a joke. Before he goes she asks him why he is lying to her—he doesn't have another place around the neighborhood to go to. He just smiles and leaves.  He sits down on the stairs in front of the house and writes down his thoughts about the girl (under the title "The Girl with the Pimpy Face"): "Boy, she was tough and no kidding but I fell for her immediately. There was that hard, straight thing about her that in itself gives an impression of excellence." The girl comes down the stairs with the infant in her arms and asks if he plans to sit there till six. She gives him her sister. After holding her for a while, he is surprised and uses his stethoscope on her. He looks worried. He gives the baby back and leaves to buy soap for the girl. His thoughts reveal that he knows that the baby has maybe 6 months to live because she has a bad heart.

When he leaves, [[lightning]] strikes the tree, imbuing the heart with magic. Years later, an older Geppetto finds the remains of the tree and carves a marionette out of it, naming him [[Pinocchio]]. Due to the heart's magic, Pinocchio comes to life, referring to Geppetto as his father. Pinocchio chases a [[pigeon]] outside, meeting Leona, and then a pair of thieves, [[The Fox and the Cat|Volpe and Felinet]], who work for [[Mangiafuoco|Lorenzini]], a sinister theater director and puppet master, informing him of Pinocchio's existence and sentience. Lorenzini tries to purchase Pinocchio, but Geppetto refuses to sell his son.  Pinocchio climbs out of a window and wanders into town, joining a group of boys in school. He gets into a fight with the rowdy [[Candlewick (character)|Lampwick]], and when he lies about it, his nose grows longer, and he is kicked out of the class. In bitterness, Pinocchio ends up causing damage to a local [[bakery]], and Geppetto is arrested as a result. Pinocchio flees home, meeting a [[Talking Cricket|talking cricket]], Pepe, who tells Pinocchio to behave in order to become a real boy. The next day, Pinocchio and Geppetto are put on trial. Unless Geppetto pays a fine, he will be imprisoned. Lorenzini enters, offering to pay off the debt if Pinocchio is given over to him. Geppetto reluctantly agrees after being reminded of his poor state.  Pinocchio becomes the star of Lorenzini's shows and is given gold coins as payment. However, Pepe helps him discover that he is ultimately unloved by Lorenzini.

From the strong smell of rotten chili peppers, they try to escape up Lorenzini's throat, Pinocchio lying to extend his nose and make the passage larger, causing his nose to break. Lorenzini starts to choke, breaching the ocean top, spitting Geppetto and Pinocchio out in the process.  On land, Pinocchio and Geppetto embrace.

Aladdin and the King of Thieves
 While the [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]] and the people of Agrabah prepare for the upcoming wedding of [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]] and [[Princess Jasmine]], Aladdin retrieves his parents' [[dagger]] from his old home, telling the Genie how his father left him when he was a child. Meanwhile the legendary Forty Thieves, led by their king, arrive at the city to raid the wedding, but Jasmine and the others fend them off, and Aladdin prevents the leader from stealing a specific scepter. After the thieves escape from the city, a powerful Oracle appears from the staff and informs Aladdin that his father is alive, but "trapped" in the world of the Thieves.  Aladdin follows the thieves to their hideout in Mount Sesame and reunites with his father [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Cassim|Cassim]], who turns out to be the King of Thieves. His second in command, [[Sa'luk]], tries to execute Aladdin for trespassing, but the only way to avoid execution is to earn his place in the group by fighting for his life: Cassim suggests that Aladdin fights with Sa'luk to earn his place among the thieves. Sa'luk falls off from the cliff to the sea, but survives and gives the hideout's password to [[Razoul]] in exchange for immunity from prosecution.  Cassim tells Aladdin about the Hand of [[Midas]], a powerful artifact turning anything into gold, which caused him to leave his family in order to eventually lead them out of their life in poverty. Aladdin persuades Cassim to accompany him back to Agrabah, where he is welcomed by Jasmine, the Genie and the [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#The Sultan|Sultan]], though only the Genie is made aware of Cassim's true identity. By doing so, Cassim is not captured when Razoul and his guards raid Mount Sesame. Sa'luk tells Razoul about Cassim's relationship with Aladdin, and a trap is set for Cassim when he and Iago, still intent on the Hand of Midas, attempt to steal the Oracle's scepter from the Sultan's treasury. When Aladdin frees Cassim and Iago, he is exposed by Razoul and willingly returns to Agrabah to face the consequences. The Sultan exonerates Aladdin once he realizes that Aladdin acted only to protect his father.  In the meantime, Sa'luk returns to Mount Sesame and rallies the few remaining thieves under his leadership by claiming that Cassim has sold them out. When Cassim and Iago return to the hideout, they are captured by Sa'luk and forced to call forth the Oracle, who leads them to the Vanishing Isle (a castle fortress attached on the back of a [[Aspidochelone|giant turtle]]), where the hand is located. Iago escapes and reunites with Aladdin, and the heroes head to the isle. Aladdin saves Cassim, and they work together to retrieve the hand while the turtle begins to dive back under the sea. Sa'luk catches up with them and forces Cassim to choose between keeping the hand or saving Aladdin. Cassim tosses the hand to Sa'luk, who incautiously catches it by its golden palm, which transforms him into a golden statue. Now realizing that his son is the treasure of his life, Cassim discards the hand and reconciles with Aladdin.  With their enemies gone, Aladdin and Jasmine get married, while Cassim and Iago, still outlawed, leave to travel the world together.  
Alaska (1996 film)
 Jake Barnes ([[Dirk Benedict]]) is flying a plane over the Alaskan wilderness. While he is flying, he is communicating with a man named Charlie (Ben Cardinal), who works for Quincy Air Service. A polar bear cub and its mother are then shown playing in the snow, not knowing that they are being watched by a pair of poachers, Colin Perry ([[Charlton Heston]]) and Mr. Koontz (Duncan Fraser), and the adult bear is then shot, leaving the cub orphaned.  Jessie Barnes ([[Thora Birch]]) and her friend Chip (Ryan Kent) are observing wildlife in their [[kayaks]] before her dinner. Jessie's father Jake begins telling her where he is flying from, at what time he left that location, and his air speed. Jessie calculates that her father is passing [[Devils Thumb]].  Jake then lands his plane on a lake, where Charlie is waiting to tie the plane up to the dock. His son, Sean ([[Vincent Kartheiser]]) scolds his father for moving their family to Alaska after their mother's death.  As Jake is making an emergency run, his plane's engines stall, causing him to lose control and crash in the Alaska wilderness. Frustrated by the lack of search effort by the police, Sean and Jessie go out to find their father on their own.  As they kayak through the chilly waters of the Gulf of Alaska, they stop to rest on a beach. They soon realize that the shore is home to a poachers’ camp. They then discover the skin of a polar bear and the young polar bear from earlier, that has been locked in a cage. They let the polar bear run free, hoping that it will save itself. After the bear leaves their camp, Colin Perry appears, in hunt of the polar bear that he believes is rightfully his property as he intends to sell the cub to a client in Hong Kong. Koontz then arrives and notices teeth marks on the frying pan, alerting Perry that the bear was there. Colin’s beliefs that the children stole the bear from his camp are confirmed when he finds his missing lighter next to their camping gear. Perry orders the kids to tell the bear to “come home” (Perry is referring to the cage at his camp as the bear’s home). The next day, Jessie and Sean continue in their search to find their missing father. They leave their kayak and begin searching on foot. They soon discover that the polar bear has once again followed them on their journey. Perry and Koontz, too, have followed the youngsters and this time they destroy the oars in their kayak and hide the kayak in the woods just in case someone comes looking for them. Just then Charlie arrives in a helicopter in search of Jessie and Sean. Perry shows Charlie a piece of the oar and tells him that he found it 25 miles north of their current position. Charlie then departs in his helicopter in hopes of finding the children, who he believes to be in grave danger and eventually discovers the two men were actually poachers after finding their campsite.  Jessie safely reaches the bottom, but Sean slips and tumbles down the mountain, hitting his head on a rock. The two then continue their journey and find a log cabin in the woods. They take shelter and Sean lies down in the bed. While in the cabin, Sean notices a canoe hanging from the ceiling. Jessie and Sean take the canoe and continue on in their search for their father. While they are canoeing down a river, the two kids encounter vicious rapids that send them and their canoe down a waterfall. Jessie is able to escape the raging river but once again, Sean’s lack of experience in the wilderness causes him to struggle. He is thrust down the river where he is helped out of the cold water by Jessie’s friend Chip and his grandfather (Byron Chief-Moon). With the kids barefoot by the riverside, Chip’s father wants to send Jessie and Sean home, but Chip and his grandfather wish to help the two on their journey. The two proceed on their quest with their befriended polar bear, whom they named Cubby, by their side.  Cubby leads them until he is shot with a tranquilizer dart by Colin. He then takes Cubby away in his helicopter, but Koontz didn’t load the darts with enough tranquilizer fluids, allowing Cubby to awaken in the helicopter and trying to fight his way free. As Koontz lowers the helicopter, Cubby escapes and bites Perry's right knee, causing Perry to shoot Koontz with a tranquilizer dart and damage the helicopter as well. Meanwhile, the children continue on in their search for their missing father. They stumble upon some wreckage from his plane crash and begin yelling for him to respond. Not able to yell, their father shoots another flare into the air. This time the children see it and run to his rescue. They find the plane hanging on the edge of a cliff, and Jessie lowers Sean down the side of the mountain to reach their father. Just as it looks like Jessie is going to lose control of the rope, Cubby appears and helps Jessie pull the rope. With Cubby's help, Jessie and Sean are able to raise their father up the side of the mountain. Just as the family is reunited, Charlie shows up in his helicopter to take them home and complete the rescue. Perry and Koontz are then shown to be trekking from their now disabled helicopter after their skirmish with Cubby, and Cubby is then introduced to a new polar bear family after saying good-bye to Sean and Jessie.  
All Dogs Go to Heaven 2
  57 years after the events of the first movie, Charlie B. Barkin ([[Charlie Sheen]]) welcomes his friend, Itchy ([[Dom DeLuise]]), to [[Heaven]], but states he is disillusioned by the afterlife. Carface Caruthers, their old enemy ([[Ernest Borgnine]]), steals [[Gabriel]]'s Horn, attempts to pass through the [[Pearly gates]] using the music they perform in order to open it so he can leave Heaven with the horn, but it closes on him to protect it from being stolen. He winds up getting stuck on it when he tries to head to the other side and then pops himself out of it. Before heading to Earth, he tries to take off his uniform, but knocks the horn down to Earth, causing him to dive into the purple cloud hole and catch it before it lands into the [[ocean]], but loses it after getting hit by an [[airplane]] and sucked into the engines. Continuing to fall to Earth, he sees that the horn lands somewhere in [[San Francisco]].  The dog angels are alerted of the horn's theft by Anabelle, the head angel ([[Bebe Neuwirth]]), who sends Charlie and Itchy to Earth to save it, and gives them one miracle to use. Upon arrival in San Francisco, they discover themselves as [[ghost]]s and therefore unable to interact with the physical world. At a tavern where Charlie flirts with a smooth-talking and gorgeous [[Irish Setter]] named Sasha La Fleur ([[Sheena Easton]]), Carface appears in a corporeal form granted by a red [[dog collar]] created by Red ([[George Hearn]]), an elderly dog fortune teller who gives Charlie and Itchy equivalent collars effective for a single day. Shortly thereafter, unbeknownst to the duo, Red reveals his true form as a [[demon]] who intends to take the horn for himself with Carface's help.  Charlie and Itchy meet Sasha and a human boy she is caring for, David ([[Adam Wylie]]), who ran away from home to become a [[street performer]], the former leading him to believe that he is his [[guardian angel]]. Before leaving for "Easy Street", Charlie uses his miracle in the form of a lustful kiss (which Sasha is angered by) to grant Sasha the ability to converse with David. Upon seeing the horn being taken into a [[police station]], they retrieve it, with Carface failing to steal it from them. Refusing to return to Heaven, Charlie conceals it in a [[lobster trap]]. On Easy Street, they entertain an audience with magic tricks, but a rainstorm and David falling into a fountain ruins the act. David finally reveals his belief that his father and stepmother, who are expecting a new baby, will care less for him once it's born; but is persuaded otherwise by Charlie. As Charlie and Sasha embrace, his collar vanishes, and he and Itchy become ghosts again.  Carface then kidnaps David and demands that Charlie bring Gabriel's horn to [[Alcatraz Island]] and give it to Red in exchange for David's life. Determined to fulfill his promise to get David home, Charlie approaches Red, who presses him to give him the horn. He does so, and Red uses it to capture Heaven's canine angels and send them to Earth in the prison cells, including Anabelle. Charlie, Itchy, Sasha, and David battle Red and steal the horn, which Charlie plays to free the angels and send Red back to [[Hell]]. Carface comes out of hiding and attempts to downplay his involvement. However, he does offer a genuine apology, hoping to finally make peace with Charlie. However, Red returns and drags Carface into Hell, which reveals to everyone that Carface unknowingly sold his soul to him in exchange for his collar.  Charlie gives the horn back to Anabelle in exchange for his life and says yet another goodbye to Itchy, who decides to remain in Heaven. After he reunites with Sasha and David, they head to the latter's house where he returns and reconciles with his parents. His stepmother is relieved that he is alive and explains she has been worried about him and says just because she is pregnant does not mean she does not love him and that they are a family. They then adopt Charlie and Sasha, and the two share a kiss, happy with their new life together.

Amityville Dollhouse
 Newlyweds Bill and Claire Martin move their new family into a new house constructed by Bill himself. Shortly after moving in Bill finds a doll house (modeled after [[The Amityville Horror|112 Ocean Avenue]]) in the shed. He brings it in the house and puts it in the garage. Later that night, Bill notices the fireplace in the house turns on by itself, heating the entire home. He has a hallucination of his daughter Jessica burning to death in the fireplace. The following morning, Claire finds the dollhouse in the garage and suggests giving it to Jessica for her birthday. At her birthday party, Jessica's aunt Marla and uncle Tobias arrive. Jessica is elated over the dollhouse and finds a chest of miniature dolls inside it: her aunt and uncle, however, seem inexplicably nervous regarding the toys.   In the ensuing days, numerous strange incidents occur: Jimmy, Claire's eldest son, loses his pet mouse, which finds its way into the dollhouse; simultaneously, Jessica is confronted by an enormous white mouse hiding under her bed. Claire also begins to have unexpected [[Sexual desire|sexual urges]] toward Todd, Bill's eldest son, and fantasizes about him while having sex with Bill. Bill is also plagued by nightmares about [[voodoo doll]]s, demons, and his family being murdered. In conversation with Marla, Bill reveals he suffered from similar dreams as a child, including a [[precognition|premonitory dream]] of his parents dying in a fire, which came true. Jimmy also experiences supernatural visitations from his deceased father, who appears to him as a decaying zombie, urging him to murder Bill.   One afternoon, Todd brings his girlfriend Dana to the home. While in an exterior shed on the property, the two find newspaper clippings about the foundation on which Bill built their new home: they surmise that the new house was built around the fireplace from the original home. The two go in the house and begin to have sex, but are attacked by a giant fly. The following evening, Bill and Claire go out for dinner, leaving Todd to babysit his younger siblings, Jimmy and Jessica. Todd invites Dana over and sends the children to bed. While Todd makes [[cocktail]]s in the kitchen, Dana's hair inexplicably catches fire, leaving her with disfiguring burns. Todd blames his father for the accident, believing it was caused by a faulty coil in the fireplace's gas line.  Meanwhile, Marla and Tobias, both of whom apparently practice magic, have taken one of the dolls from Jessica's dollhouse. They perform a ritual on the doll and watch it come to life. Objects begin to fly around their home and Tobias stabs the doll with a knife, after which a large fly escapes. Later, Claire finds an unexplained bruise on Jimmy's face and believes Bill hit him. She shuts him out of the house, only to be confronted by the zombie of her deceased husband, who ties both her and Jimmy up and forces them to sit in front of the fireplace. Bill attempts to enter the house through the garage, but is knocked unconscious by [[carbon monoxide]] fumes from his car, which begins running by itself. Tobias arrives at the home and is able to save Bill. The two enter the home: with him, Tobias has the voodoo doll he had taken from the dollhouse.  Tobias and Bill fight with the zombie, and Jimmy throws the voodoo doll into the fireplace, causing the zombie to disappear. Todd is then visited by an apparition of Dana, who is in the hospital: she attempts to kill him, but Claire intercedes. The family attempts to flee the house, but cannot find Jessica. Scrawled on a piece of paper, they find a list of observations Jessica has made about the dollhouse, one of which reads: "My hand disappears in the fireplace." Bill realizes the fireplace is a [[Portals in fiction|portal to somewhere else]]. Bill and Tobias enter the fireplace and realize they have in fact entered the dollhouse. They find Jessica on the floor, surrounded by bloodied remnants of the voodoo dolls. Tobias casts a protective spell, allowing Bill and Jessica to flee: Tobias, however, is dragged away by the demons that have escaped from the dolls. Bill destroys the dollhouse by tossing it into the fireplace. As they flee in their car, the house explodes behind them.

The housekeeper explains that the rebels have asked everyone in the village to keep the lights off, and that for all, times have been bad.

Several days earlier, Suwisal's fiancee ([[Yashoda Wimaladharma]]) calls to remind him of jury duty. He is to spend the next three days listening to a theft/murder case. The defendant, Piyum ([[Swarna Mallawarachchi]]) has been charged with the murder of John Wijesinghe. She is a prostitute and Wijesinghe, a client.

Andha Naal (1996 film)
  The film begins with the church Father James ([[Anandaraj]]) digging up a coffin in the graveyard in the middle of the night. Father James found inside the coffin a dead body of Babu ([[Raja (Tamil actor)|Raja]]) stabbed in the heart with a knife, so he immediately calls the police. The police inspector Rangaraj after seeing the dead body decided to hush up the issue and buried the coffin. The news was spread rapidly and it is now on the front pages of every newspaper. Very quickly, the police were being heavily criticised for smothering up the sordid affair.  [[Superintendent of police (India)|SP]] Vikramadithyan ([[Prem Menon (actor)|Prem Menon]]) decides to take up himself in this sordid case. He digs up the coffin and sends the corpse to the post-mortem examination. Vikramadithyan first examines the Father church James and James tells what happened in the past.  Babu ([[Raja (Tamil actor)|Raja]]) was a spoiled student specialist in ragging other students and in annoying the professors. Babu clashed many times with his classmate Mary ([[Mohini (Tamil actress)|Mohini]]) who was a soft-spoken student and a religious person. Being an orphan, she was brought up by Father James. Babu slowly fell in love with her, he became a good man and he eventually converted to Christianity. Finally, Vincent Babu and Mary got married at the church with the blessings of Father James. At the wedding night, Babu shews his true colours. He was, in fact, a drunkard and a womanizer, he acted as a good man all along only for spending time with Mary one night and he left her the next day. Many years later, Babu reappeared as a melancholic man who lost all his wealth and asked Father James for forgiveness. Mary had a boy called Alex (Master Nadim Khan). Alex forced his mother Mary to live with Babu who had not changed at all. Babu's behaviors became worse : he behaved badly with the school teacher Poornitha ([[Rani (Tamil actress)|Raksha]]) in public, he spent time with a prostitute ([[Shakeela]]), he even tried to seduce Lakshmi (Kavitha) who resurfaced to see her daughter Mary, he drank a lot of alcohols in a bar owned by ([[Alex (actor)|Alex]]) and worst that he molested his wife and beat up his son. One night, Father James was informed of Babu's death and they all proceed to his funeral the same evening. When a worker tried to hammer the first nail in the coffin, the hammer fell from the hands and hit Babu's chest. Babu opened his eyes briefly and Father James noticed it.  Vikramadithyan is now determined to find the culprit. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.  
The Apartment (1996 film)
 Max ([[Vincent Cassel]]) is a former bohemian and an amateur writer who gets a job in New York and leaves his girlfriend Lisa ([[Monica Bellucci]]), with whom he was madly in love, in mysterious circumstances. After two years, he returns home to Paris, and decides to settle down and gets engaged to Muriel ([[Sandrine Kiberlain]]). By chance, he catches a glimpse of his lost love, Lisa, in a café, but fails to make contact with her before she storms out. Determined to meet her, Max secretly cancels his business trip abroad to pursue his lost love. Through a series of ruses and perseverance, he enters Lisa's apartment. Hearing that somebody else has arrived, he hides in her wardrobe.  First, he thinks it is Lisa, as the girl who came to the apartment resembles Lisa from behind. After several misunderstandings, they finally get acquainted. The girl introduces herself as Lisa. The same night, they make love, and their relationship starts to develop. The girl's real name is Alice ([[Romane Bohringer]]). During the film, flashbacks are intertwined with the narrative to provide a background for Max, Lisa, and especially for Alice, shedding light on the situation.  The flashbacks show that Alice and Lisa were best friends, living in apartments on the same floor of two facing buildings, and that Alice became obsessed with Max, Lisa's then-boyfriend, from a distance. She restyled herself to look like Lisa while secretly engineering a breakup between them. Lisa is a stage actress and leaves abruptly for a two-month tour, giving Alice a letter to deliver to Max asking him to wait for her; Alice never sends the letter. Max, believing Lisa left because she didn't love him, accepts a job in New York and leaves. Upon her return, Lisa is heartbroken that Max has left her and leaves on a cruise (a gift from Alice) to ease her mind, where she meets a rich, married older man named Daniel.  Lisa is being pursued by Daniel, who might have murdered his wife to get closer to her. For this reason, she avoids her flat and lets Alice use it. To complicate matters further, Alice is dating Max's best friend, Lucien, who is also Max's confidante.  Eventually, the truth begins to unravel in front of everyone's eyes, leading to dramatic and life-changing consequences for all involved.  In a sub-plot, Alice is seen to be acting in Shakespeare's ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', drawing comparisons between the four lovers in the film and those in the play; it is arguable that the whole film is a rendition of the play.   The film begins and ends in "reality" where Max and Muriel have a world weary but sensible life in high finance (and the implication is that Muriel is the boss's daughter, thus imitating Egeus' involvement in Hermia's marriage to Demetrius), but almost all the action takes place in a dreamlike trance where the lovers don't really know who they love. Lucien is always faithful to Alice, and pursues her, but both Alice and Lisa (who, as their names imply, are reflections of each other) initially both love Max, and Max, although madly in love with Lisa, turns to Alice after reading her diary, just before reality dawns and he accepts his fate with Muriel. Alice leaves her life behind and flies to Rome, bidding Max one last farewell glance as he embraces Muriel at the airport. Lisa returns to her apartment and is confronted by Daniel, who drops a lighter on the floor (covered in gasoline) causing the apartment to explode and blowing Lucien through the window of a café across the street.

The Associate
 Investment banker Laurel Ayres ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]) is a smart and single woman trying to make it up the Wall Street corporate ladder, until one day she finds out that she is passed over for a promotion because she is a woman. Unable to face the fact that her less intelligent male protege, Frank Peterson ([[Tim Daly]]), has now become her boss, she quits and tries to start up her own company only to find out that the male dominated world of Wall Street is not interested in taking an [[African American]] woman seriously, and thus is forced to create a fictional white man, Robert S. Cutty (inspired by a bottle of [[Cutty Sark]]) in order to be judged on her own merits. Ayres' financial wisdom is joined by the intelligent and computer-savvy secretary Sally Dugan ([[Dianne Wiest]]), who also was not properly recognized for her talents. Together they are able to become the most successful independent stockbrokers in the world while helping a struggling high-tech computer company stay afloat.  However, the ruse eventually runs into problems, as Cutty is still getting credit for Ayres' great ideas, and competing firms and tabloid journalists are willing to do anything in order to bring the wealthy and elusive Cutty into the public and on their side. Thus Ayres is forced to get her best friend (who works at a nightclub as a female impersonator) to create an effective disguise in the mould of Marlon Brando to try to fool the naysayers; when that fails, she and Dugan decide to kill Cutty only to be charged with his murder. Frank uncovers the ruse and pretends that he is now the front man to world-famous Cutty.  The film ends with Ayres donning the Cutty disguise one last time to attend a meeting of the exclusive gentlemen's club to accept Cutty's awards and unmasking herself in order to teach the male-dominated industry the evils of racial and sexual discrimination. Ayres is finally given credit for her work and creates a huge business empire with her friends at the helm. Frank attempts to land a job with the business, only to be laughed off.  
Army Daze
 This is the bestselling coming-of-age novel by Michael Chiang, a semi-fictionalised autobiography and reminiscence of lost youth and boyhood.  The film shows six men of different backgrounds enlisting in their National Service. Malcolm; a nerd and "mother's boy", Johari; a large, laid-back hipster Malay man, Krishna; a heroic and loving Indian lover, Ah Beng; a gangster-like delinquent, and Kenny; the effeminate boy who is into women's lifestyle are all introduced as they make their way reporting to the manpower base before assigned to their camp. Malcolm serves as the narrator, the army life is seen through his eyes and thoughts. All six men are placed in Hotel Company Platoon 4, alongside various other males.  Prior to enlisting, Malcolm is seen interacting with a shady Mr. X at the manpower base who sells him a guidebook teaching ways of playing truant in the army while Krishna makes a heart to heart final talk with Lathi, his girlfriend. When Platoon 4 is brought to their bunks after bidding farewell to their loved ones, the six men share their thoughts on the current state of affairs, before being introduced to their drill instructor, Corporal (CPL) Ong, who is a tough-as-nails stereotyped army man. He dramatically tells them all about their upcoming life, then leads them all to their mandatory haircut. At night, the six men introduce themselves to one another, with Malcolm finding himself out of the league almost immediately.  Training goes on with morning physical training, and soon comes the standard obstacle course. The six are shown trying hard but failing, albeit comically, to get through the various itineraries. The recruits are next shown to learn about camouflage, and again unfortunately, they comically fail, upsetting CPL Ong, who tries his best previously to appease his superior, Captain (CPT) Lim.  Soon comes the day relatives and family are allowed to visit the recruits at their camp. Krishna reunites with his lover Lathi dramatically, Ah Beng has his sister Ah Huay outlandishly showing up and Malcolm meets his mother, although she is sickened by the army training her son is put through and demanded to complain. Johari feels his parents aren't coming due to potential weddings to attend, and Kenny dismisses his parents as absent due to holiday. Nevertheless, all six gather for a picture at the moment with Ah Huay photographing.  During combat training, the platoon is introduced to an unsurprising instructor; Sergeant (SGT) Wendy Chung. She is tougher than expected, but Ah Beng unwittingly falls for her. Field camp is next. While the six are assigned to bunk with each other under tents, Kenny and Malcolm try to turn their campsite homely which enrages their commanding officer SGT Monteiro. He punishes both to guard duty, and it turns out Krishna is down for it as well since he attempted to feign a reason for absence but is caught (he is revealed to have bought the same book as Malcolm did and tried its contents). Unfortunately, at nightfall during duty, Krishna faints from shock after getting into a scuffle with a python, and Malcolm discovers him. In lieu of this, Second Lieutenant (2LT) Collin Heng decides to pay a visit to Krishna's immediate family alongside CPL Ong and Malcolm, whom he feels they need to meet. With Krishna's parents overseas, Lathi breaks down upon hearing the news but is comforted by 2LT Heng, who inadvertently informally introduces himself, making Lathi enticed by him. Malcolm however notices this.  After discharged from the medical center, Krishna returns to his bunk to find it empty, only to realise the entire platoon is given off for outstanding performance. The six surprise greet him, but it goes sour after Kenny tried disclosing that Lathi was flirting with 2LT Heng and he claims it was all seen by Malcolm who vehemently denies saying it is so. Krishna is shocked, demanding for the truth from Malcolm who neither affirms it. Kenny continues to go on a tirade before getting snapped back by Johari who had enough of his antics. Kenny angrily storms off, revealing he was left behind by his parents to serve his NS while they left for Australia without him. Johari and Malcolm go out to pacify him, with Krishna crestfallen before Ah Beng who too tries to do the same. Krishna nearly thinks of breaking up with Lathi but is chided by Ah Beng for being shallow given the circumstances, and Kenny pours out to Malcolm and Johari the undesirable truth his parents said to him about serving his time in the army, to which in fact they are right he needed to be who he is and man up.  In a phonecall, Krishna and Lathi manage to reconcile, while Malcolm finally manages to refuse requests from his overprotective mother. The six men bond together as their final days of military training is ending, with each speaking out their desired vocations and the respective responses from one another. The training finally ends with a route march where everyone completes successfully.  Graduating from military training, the families of the six come to pick them up and they all share the efforts and camaraderie they have, now bonded not just as soldiers but like brothers. SGT Wendy Chung then introduces star Deanna Yusoff, whom Johari is previously known to be a big fan of. He is stunned by her appearance as he often dreamed of being with her and they share a final picture with everyone.  In the end, Malcolm signs on with the army and is a Captain while remaining faithful to his nerdy hobbies, Krishna becomes a lawyer and together with Lathi who becomes famous start a family, Johari joins the media industry and finally gets to work with Deanna, Kenny goes into boutique sales and dreams to become a dance choreographer for big events, and Ah Beng who went onto become a cellphone manager and striking lottery which he buys a diamond ring for SGT Wendy Chung.  
The Arrival (1996 film)
 The film starts with [[National Center for Atmospheric Research|NCAR]] [[Climatology|climatologist]] Ilana Green ([[Lindsay Crouse]]) examining a poppy field and remarking that it "shouldn't be here".  It is revealed that the poppy field is in the middle of the Arctic.  Zane Zaminsky ([[Charlie Sheen]]), a [[radio astronomy|radio astronomer]] working for [[SETI Institute|SETI]], discovers an [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] radio signal from Wolf 336, a star 14 [[light year]]s from Earth. Zane reports this to his supervisor, Phil Gordian ([[Ron Silver]]) at the [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), but Phil dismisses the claims. Zane soon finds that he has been fired because of supposed budget cuts, and blacklisted, preventing him from working at other telescopes. Taking a job as a television satellite installer, he creates his own [[telescope array]] using his customers' dishes in the neighborhood, operating it secretly from his attic with help of his young next door neighbor, Kiki ([[Tony T. Johnson]]).  Zane again locates the radio signal, but it is drowned out by a terrestrial signal from a Mexican radio station. Zane attempts to tell his former coworker, Calvin ([[Richard Schiff]]), but finds he has just died suspiciously from carbon monoxide poisoning. Zane travels to the fictional town of San Marsol in [[Mexico]] and finds that the local radio station, from which the signal apparently originated, was burnt to the ground. Searching the area around town, he comes across a new power plant. There, he meets Ilana Green, and tries to help protect her atmospheric analysis equipment from the plant's overzealous security forces. While in custody at the plant, Ilana explains that the Earth's [[Temperature record|temperature]] has recently risen several degrees, melting the polar ice. She is investigating the power plant, one of several recently built across the developing world, that appears to be the cause of this increase. The two are released, but without Ilana's equipment. Surprisingly, Zane realizes one of the guards could pass as the identical twin of his former boss, Phil. As Zane and Ilana regroup, Phil instructs some agents, posing as gardeners, to release an alien device in Zane's attic that creates a miniature black hole, consuming all of Zane's equipment. Zane leaves Ilana to again investigate the power plant and she is soon killed by scorpions planted in her room.  Zane discovers the plant doubles as a front for an underground alien base. The very different looking aliens are able to disguise themselves with an external skin to infiltrate human society. Zane finds that all of the bases expel large amounts of [[greenhouse gas]] into the atmosphere. Zane is discovered but escapes back into the nearby town and attempts to convince the local sheriff of the situation. However, alien agents bring Ilana's body to the police station, making Zane a suspect in her death; Zane escapes and sneaks back into the United States. He accosts Phil on the JPL grounds, forcing him to admit that the aliens are trying to raise the Earth's temperature to not only kill off humans (by greatly exacerbating [[anthropogenic climate change]]) but to make the planet hospitable for themselves. Zane secretly records the conversation and once Phil discovers the recording he sends agents to stop Zane.  Zane returns home to find his attic devoid of equipment. He figures out the only way to broadcast the tape is to go to a nearby large satellite up-link and beam the signal directly to a hacked news satellite, broadcasting it worldwide. With the help of his girlfriend Char ([[Teri Polo]]) and Kiki, he travels to the satellite [[ground station]]. Phil and his agents soon disable the satellite controls from the main building. Wondering how they were found so quickly, Zane briefly suspects Char of being an alien, until they are both attacked by one of Phil's agents. Zane leaves the tape with Kiki and instructs him to transmit it when he gives the order and then he and Char sneak over to the satellite's base and barricade themselves in the control room. Zane makes the necessary adjustments and tells Kiki to activate the tape, but Kiki reveals himself to be an alien agent and he opens the door to allow Phil inside, who confiscates the tape.    Phil and his agents ram down the door to the satellite control room with a van, but Zane freezes them with liquid nitrogen vapors. As he works to free the tape stuck in Phil's frozen jacket, one of the agents drops a sphere which starts to form another singularity in the room. Phil begins to defrost, and tries to grab Zane's arm, but Zane smashes off Phil's arm with a fire axe. Zane and Char escape through the satellite's optical path, exiting safely onto the collapsed dish before the device implodes most of the satellite dish's base. In the distance they see Kiki, and Zane tells him to tell the aliens that he will soon broadcast this tape; they watch as Kiki runs off. In the film's epilogue, Zane's conversation with Phil is broadcast across the globe.

Avvai Shanmughi
 The film starts in a courtroom where a woman Janaki ([[Meena Durairaj|Meena]]) is fighting for divorce from her husband Pandian ([[Kamal Haasan]]). She offers various reasons for wanting a divorce. She has married Pandian against the wishes of her rich father Vishwanathan [[Iyer]] ([[Gemini Ganesan]]). But she isn't able to come to terms with living in Pandian's small house without amenities. Pandian is an assistant dance director with a modest income and is not able to spend much time with the family. All this accumulates and Janaki decides to apply for divorce, which is granted. The court orders that Pandian can meet his daughter Barathi, once a week and this is his only solace. His daughter, however, loves him a lot and doesn't like the arrangement.  Basha ([[Nassar]]), Pandian's [[Muslim]] friend who works in a hotel as a chef, advises him to steal his daughter from Janaki. Pandian goes about trying to do as his friend suggests. In doing so, he is discovered; and now he cannot meet her at all. Then Pandian finds out that Vishwanathan Iyer has advertised for a woman to look after his granddaughter. Joseph ([[Nagesh]]) is a makeup man in films. In conversation with him, Pandian gets the idea of playing an old woman, so that he can be with his child and ex-wife without them knowing. Joseph agrees to this plan and the transformation is done from Pandian to 'Avvai Shanmugi'-- (also Kamal Haasan)adignified, elderly Iyer woman who is hired to take care of the little girl.  Rathna ([[Heera Rajgopal]]) is a girl who is in love with Pandian but is constantly rebuffed. Basha takes up the role of a mute Iyer cook and is admitted into Vishwanathan Iyer house on the recommendation of Avvai Shanmugi. However, Basha is caught later while doing his namaz, thereby shattering both lies—that he is mute and an Iyer. Hilarious circumstances follow and slowly Avvai Shanmugi manages to convince the household of her sincerity. So much so that Janaki's widowed father begins to develop a liking for Avvai and in fact proposes to her too. Around the same time, Mudaliyar ([[Manivannan]]), the house-owner of the place where Pandian lives, sympathizing with her for being a widow, happens to bump into Avvai Shanmugi. This happens many times and Mudaliyar, too, begins to develop a liking for her.  Meanwhile, Pandian slowly begins to realize that Janaki hasn't totally forgotten him. Avvai rebuffs Vishwanathan's proposals by saying that her husband is alive.

Bad Day on the Block
 The film opens with a fire. Lyle Wilder ([[Charlie Sheen]]) is a decorated [[Los Angeles]] [[firefighter]] who saved an [[Afro-American]] baby's life in a [[crack house]] fire. He was honored for his bravery. However, Lyle Wilder is a [[psychopath]], who had his wife, Marge and son, Kenny (Rory Flynn) leave him because of his violent tendencies. He believes that the neighbors ([[Mare Winningham]] and [[David Andrews (actor)|David Andrews]]) and their two children (Noah Fleiss and Chelsea Russo) are to blame for them leaving by manipulating his wife. Lyle began to hurt their children. Lyle also terrorizes Reese and Catherine Braverton. He does not excuse any accidents made by the Bravertons' two children, Zach and Chelsea. Lyle continues thinking that the Bravertons are his enemies. In [[flashback (continuity)|flashbacks]], it shows his violent tendencies, like playing [[Russian roulette]] with his wife and he being angry on his son's birthday (stemming from his own strict disciplinary upbringing). In another flashback, it is shown that Lyle left the mother of the baby to die in the fire because he considered her negligent.  Lyle still loves his wife and wants to ruin the Bravertons' life, because of their happiness. One day, the Bravertons' refrigerator malfunctions, and they call a repairman who gets the wrong address. The repairman, Ron, arrives at Lyle's house, who makes racist remarks (as Ron reminds him of a slum lord, whose negligence of a gas leak led to many fatalities). A slanging match ensues a fight, which ends with Ron's death; his mouth is [[superglue]]d shut to silence his screams. During this time, the Bravertons report Lyle to the police for threatening them. Officers Al Calavito and Sandy Tierra respond to the call. Because of Lyle's decorated status, Calavito and Tierra doubt the Bravertons. When they go to see Lyle, Lyle tells them that the Bravertons are lying and that Reese beats Catherine. After Lyle breaks into the Bravertons' house again, Calavito and Tierra search Lyle's house.  Tierra discovers the repairman's body while Lyle attacks and murders Calavito, by slamming a fireman's axe into his torso.  Sandy overhears the struggle and goes to help Calavito, but she is also killed by having her neck broken (while Lyle rants disciplinary [[scripture]]). Later, Reese goes over to talk to Lyle, who savagely beats him.  After tying him up, Lyle throws Reese through the Bravertons' kitchen window.  Lyle begins to play Russian roulette with the Bravertons, explaining how his late father taught him its history (along with numerous other disciplinary methods by which he abides) prior to his ''luck in roulette expiring''. Zack stabs Lyle with a pocket knife, which only makes Lyle angrier. Catherine tries to talk to Lyle, pretending to be his ex-wife. While he is confused, Reese attacks Lyle from behind. After a brief fight, Lyle (distraught that he is being blamed for his actions) is shot by Catherine (branding him a coward). As he dies, Lyle stares at the engraving his wife inscribed on his watch (a sign of happier times). The film ends with the Bravertons spending some time as a family, trying not to notice a billboard displaying Lyle representing L.A.'s fire department.

Gustavo takes it, and runs towards where Castro is standing, aiming the gun at him. Gustavo is shot dead by a guard.

Bad Moon
  While making love in their tent during a work expedition in [[Nepal]], photo-journalists Ted Harrison ([[Michael Paré]]) and his girlfriend Marjorie are attacked by a [[werewolf]]. The werewolf snatches Marjorie and Ted attempts to rescue her but gets bitten in his shoulder and thrown to the ground. Hurt but determined he crawls to his shotgun and manages to shoot the werewolf's head off but not before the beast kills Marjorie.  With the intent of living in isolation Ted moves back home into a trailer in the woods hours away from his lawyer sister Janet Harrison ([[Mariel Hemingway]]). One day in an effort to reach out to her and his young nephew Brett ([[Mason Gamble]]), Ted calls them up and invites them for a meal at his home by the lake. Upon seeing him again the family dog, Thor, begins to sense something wrong with "Uncle Ted" and goes into the woods tracking a smell, which leads him to human remains hanging on a tree branch. Meanwhile, Ted tells Janet that his girlfriend Marjorie broke up with him and returned to her home in [[Seattle]], hiding the truth from her, and in an attempt at comforting her brother, Janet invites him to stay with them. Shaken and fearful of hurting them, Ted declines and Janet, Brett and Thor leave before the sun starts to set, at Ted's insistence.  The next day, there is an investigation going on in the woods near Ted's trailer where the mangled bodies of several missing hikers and a Forest Ranger were found. Under fear of being found guilty, Ted calls Janet and tells her he's changed his mind. He parks his trailer in her yard in the hopes that in being near his family, he'll be able to control himself. However, Thor is aware of Ted's nature and becomes suspicious and eventually hostile towards him. Noticing that he goes out to "jog" at night with handcuffs, Thor becomes frenzied until Janet lets him out of the house. Tracking his scent, Thor follows Ted into the woods and finds him turned into a werewolf and tied to a tree while growling, clawing and trying to escape. Meanwhile, Janet starts looking for Thor and goes into the woods. Aware of her danger, Thor manages to find and distract her back to the house before she finds Ted.  The next day while making breakfast, Janet sees on TV the news coverage on the killings and confronts her brother about not telling her his true reasons for visiting her and invites him to stay permanently. While Brett is watching ''[[Werewolf of London]]'' (mistakenly confused for ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]''), he and Ted discuss werewolves and their existence, with Ted stating that it doesn't take a full moon to start the transformation and that he has "been acquainted with a few in his time" and Brett states that werewolves don't exist. While Brett throws out the trash, Ted tries to warn his sister and advises her to start listening to Thor and his sudden change in behavior and drops hints that the murders had been done by a wolf. She ignores his pleas and he retreats into his trailer where Thor follows him, waiting for him until the sun starts to set. Ted encounters a suspicious Thor but eventually leaves the trailer with the hopes of chaining himself again. With the sun setting Ted screams for Janet to take Thor away and when she does he rushes into the woods. Thor is afraid of Ted hurting his family and begins to bark until Brett lets him out of the house. He makes his way to the woods to find that Ted was too late and wasn't able to handcuff himself and has made his way into the backyard. Werewolf Ted attacks Thor but the dog fights back which wakes up Janet. Werewolf Ted is scared away when she turns on the bright deck lights. Janet sees Thor's injuries and, fearful of Ted's advice, calls the Sheriff and goes into Ted's trailer to notify him. She does not find Ted but instead finds his werewolf book, gruesome pictures of Marjorie's body and some of Ted's victims. She also finds a journal in which Ted details his pain and his turmoil with not finding a cure for his "disease" and his hopes of finding peace by his family's side. Werewolf Ted seems to lurk outside the trailer but Janet leaves safely, shaken but adamant about straightening things out with her brother. Later that night, a "flopsy" who had previously tried to frame Thor for a false bite goes into Janet and Brett's yard with the intent of killing Thor but is instead attacked and killed by Werewolf Ted.  The next day, the sheriff shows up and questions Janet about Thor and informs her of the "flopsy's" attack by a wild animal; his mutilated body's been found 100 yards away from her property. Remembering Thor's injuries Janet asks if the culprit could have been a wolf but the sheriff says no and advises her to give up Thor to the dog pound. Not believing Thor could be the killer, she confronts Ted, who provokes Thor to attack him. As a result, Thor is taken to the dog pound. Seemingly more confident and accepting of his bloodlust, Ted "marks his territory" by urinating in Thor's doghouse (as Thor had done to his trailer earlier) and shows hostility towards Brett, who feels Ted is the reason Thor was turned in. Brett pretends to go to sleep but packs his backpack and sneaks out of the house to free Thor while Janet confronts Ted in the woods with a hand gun and 8 rounds. In the woods, Ted accuses his sister of not listening to his warnings and knowing the truth all along. As he begins to transform, Janet flees in panic back to the house with Werewolf Ted on her trail. Meanwhile, Brett reaches the dog pound on his bicycle, breaks in and frees Thor, who takes off running and gets to the house just as Werewolf Ted is about to attack Janet. A vicious fight ensues between them with Thor savagely biting and injuring Werewolf Ted several times and Werewolf Ted throwing Thor across the room and seemingly killing him. Brett, having followed Thor and worried about his mom, goes into his room and is strangled and held up by his throat by Werewolf Ted. Seeing an opportunity, Janet unloads all eight rounds into Ted, who releases Brett and spins from the shots. Hurt but still alive, he growls at the now defenseless Janet. However, Thor gets up, gets between them and throws himself on Werewolf Ted, knocking them both out the window and into the yard. Werewolf Ted is severely injured but gets up and retreats into the woods. Though Thor is injured as well, he follows Werewolf Ted and tracks him down until sunrise, where a now human Ted emerges from behind a tree bruised, beaten and bloody. Standing his ground and ready to attack, Thor whimpers in reluctance, but Ted tells him to "do it" and with no more hesitation Thor lunges at him and finishes him off.  Some time later, Janet's house is being repaired and she and Brett are seen petting Thor, who is bandaged and recovering from the fight. Janet apologizes for blaming him and putting him in the dog pound. Suddenly, Thor (as a werewolf) savagely growls at her. Janet wakes up alarmed and quickly realizes it was just a nightmare as she, Brett and Thor are fine and at peace.

She pulls and kicks him off of Bone, screams at him, then carries her out of the house away from him to her car. Glen stumbles out of the house after Anney, screaming his apologies and saying he can't live without her. Anney yells at him to stay away and puts Bone into her car. When Glen tries to comfort her, she pushes him away, gets into her car, starts it and tries to drive away, starting to abandon him. Glen then leans against the car door and repeatedly smashes his head against it, screaming for Anney to kill him. Instead, she strokes his head in forgiveness, believing he will never hurt Bone again. Ultimately, Anney returns to Glen.  Moments after, Bone is taken to the hospital by Aunt Raylene. When the cops attempt to question her about who brutalized her, she still refuses to reveal that it was Glen and calls out for her Momma who is nowhere to be found. In the end, Bone is allowed to stay with her Aunt Raylene and Uncle Earle, far away from the reach of those who would harm her. Her mother visits one final time to deliver to her the copy of her birth certificate without the mark of "ILLEGITIMATE", and apologizes for what happened, before driving away to rejoin Glen. Bone remains with her Aunt Raylene, and with this final, tearful goodbye, she cries for her mother's sacrifice and for the freedom she has at last achieved.  
Barb Wire (film)
 ''Barb Wire'' is set in 2017 during the "[[Second American Civil War]]". Barb Wire ([[Pamela Anderson]]) owns the Hammerhead, a nightclub in [[Steel Harbor]] — "the last free city" in a [[United States]] ravaged by the civil war — and she brings in extra cash working as a [[mercenary]] and [[bounty hunter]]. Chief of Police Willis ([[Xander Berkeley]]) raids her club. Willis's target is fugitive Dr. Corrina "Cora D" Devonshire ([[Victoria Rowell]]), a former government scientist with information about a bioweapon being developed by her former superior, Colonel Pryzer ([[Steve Railsback]]) of the Congressional Directorate. Dr. Devonshire hopes to escape to [[Canada]] in order to make this information public.  Devonshire later turns up at the Hammerhead. She is accompanied by Axel Hood ([[Temuera Morrison]]), a "[[freedom fighter]]" whom Barb had known and loved at the outbreak of the war, but the two were separated during the conflict. Axel is trying to help Cora get to Canada. They are trying to find a contraband pair of [[contact lens]]es that will allow Cora to evade the [[retinal scan]] at the Steel Harbor airport. The lenses pass through the hands of several lowlifes before also ending up at Barb's nightclub.  Rather than give the lenses to Cora and Axel, Barb makes a deal with "Big Fatso" (Andre Rosey Brown), the leader of a [[wrecking yard|junkyard]] gang: Fatso wants the lenses, which are worth a fortune on the [[black market]], and Barb wants a million dollars and an armed escort to the airport, where ''she'' plans to get on the plane to Canada. But Fatso double-crosses Barb; when Barb, Axel, and Cora show up at the junkyard to make the swap, Colonel Pryzer and his storm troopers are also there, along with Chief of Police Willis. Willis makes a show of arresting Barb and Cora, but instead of putting [[handcuffs]] on Barb, he slips her a [[hand grenade]]. Barb uses the grenade to kill Fatso and cause enough confusion to allow Barb, Axel, Cora, and Willis to pile into Barb's armored van and lead the Congressionals on a [[car chase]], culminating in a hand-to-hand fight between Barb and Colonel Pryzer on a forklift suspended by crane above the harbor. Pryzer falls to his death while Barb escapes.  In the end, the party makes it to the airport, where Barb reveals that she still has the contact lenses. She gives them to Cora, and Cora and Axel get on the plane to Canada while Willis and Barb remain on the rainswept tarmac.  
The Beast (1996 film)
 The film begins with Howard Griffin and Elizabeth Griffin having a romantic night out on a [[yacht]] near the [[Pacific Northwest]] [[resort]] community, Graves' Point. After a freak occurrence causes the yacht to sink, the two are forced to head for shore in a lifeboat, only to be attacked and eaten by an unseen creature hours later. The next day, local [[fisherman]] Whip Dalton ([[William Petersen]]) finds the empty lifeboat and discovers a large claw stuck into the boat. Whip sends the claw to a [[university]] to be analyzed and it ends up in the hands of [[marine biologist]] Dr. Herbert Talley ([[Ronald Guttman]]), who comes to Grave’s Point claiming it is from the [[tentacle]] of a [[giant squid]]. The island [[harbor master]] Schuyler Graves ([[Charles Martin Smith]]) hires Lucas Coven ([[Larry Drake]]) to kill the squid after Whip's initial refusal. Coven succeeds in slaying a squid and the carcass is promptly sold by Graves to Sea Land [[Texas]] owner Osborne Manning ([[Denis Arndt]]). The unmanned sonar detects another, much larger squid which remains unnoticed by the islanders.  When Whip and Talley aren't allowed to see the squid to examine it, Dr. Talley organizes a [[submersible]] expedition to explore the squid’s habitat. After analyzing the carcass of the dead squid, the scientists determine it is just a baby. The information comes too late, however, and the adult squid attacks the submersible, killing everyone on board. Whip angrily blames Graves for the incident which also resulted in the death of Whip's daughter's boyfriend. Graves then blackmails Lucas to resume the hunt for the adult squid or he'll shut Lucas down for illegal trap fishing.  Lucas resumes the hunt along with Whip's friend, Mike, and another crew member. After enduring stormy weather they decide to head back to shore and continue the hunt the next day. The Squid attacks the boat before they make it to shore, pulling a crew member off with its tentacle and knocking a cargo net on Mike, injuring him. It then attacks Lucas in the helm who fires a couple of shots with his gun at its tentacles. The squid then bites a hole in the hull. With water pouring in, it pulls the entire boat underwater. Whip, after learning that Mike went out to help Lucas comes to the rescue and, finding Mike holding onto a buoy, pulls him out of the water and takes him to the hospital. Whip then agrees to go out and hunt the giant squid but only if he can use his boat and Graves goes with him. He is also accompanied by [[coast guard]] officer, Lt. Kathryn Marcus ([[Karen Sillas]]), Dr. Talley, and Manning. They plan to snare the squid, reel it in, and shoot it multiple times with darts full of [[cyanide]]. The plan succeeds and the squid appears dead. But when the ship’s [[engine]] breaks down, Manning reveals that he filled the darts with tranquilizer instead of cyanide so he could take the squid alive back to Sea Land. Whip tries to cut the squid loose, but it wakes up and attacks the ship. Talley, Graves, and Manning are eaten. A coast guard [[helicopter]] arrives in time to pick up Kathryn and Whip. As he boards the helicopter, Whip fends the squid off with an [[axe]], chopping open several extra [[fuel]] [[Drum (container)|drum]]s and has Kathryn use a [[flare gun]] to [[arson|light his boat on fire]] cause an [[explosion]] that incinerates the squid. The helicopter flies them back to the shore where they reunite with Whip's daughter Dana (Missy Crider).  
The Battle Over Citizen Kane
 In ''Citizen Kane'', Welles plays [[Charles Foster Kane]], whose fictional life partially mirrors that of Hearst's.  However, [[Chicago]] inventor and utilities magnate [[Samuel Insull]], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' publisher [[Robert R. McCormick]], and even Welles's own life were used in creating Kane.  In 1939, based partly on the strength of his imaginative and successful [[New York City|New York]] plays, which were produced under the aegis of the [[Mercury Theatre]] (such as an adaptation of [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] ''[[Macbeth]]'', which featured an all-[[African American|black]] cast and was set in the [[jungle]]), and the infamy of his October 30, 1938, [[radio]] broadcast of [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'', which sent residents of [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey]] into a panic, Orson Welles was able to negotiate a virtually unheard-of two-picture deal with [[RKO Pictures]], the smallest of the [[Studio system#Sound and the Big Five|'big five']] major studios in this era. The deal gave him creative control under a budget limit.  ''The Battle Over Citizen Kane'' also details the lives of Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst before ''Citizen Kane'', and Hearst's manipulation of the heads of the four largest [[Hollywood]] studios—[[Columbia Pictures]], Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, [[Paramount Pictures]], and [[Warner Bros.]]—to combine their efforts and financial strength to buy the camera negative of the film from RKO with the express purpose of destroying it, and how the film affected their lives after the release of the film.  During this period, however, William Randolph Hearst was actually millions of dollars in debt, mainly owing to his excessive spending, particularly on his continuing construction of his already sprawling [[Hearst Castle|mansion]] near [[San Simeon, California]], which was located on a property approximately half the size of the state of [[Rhode Island]].  While married to [[Millicent Hearst]], he kept a mistress over twenty years his junior, the actress [[Marion Davies]].  Davies had been a [[silent film]]-era star, who worked on a number of [[Sound film|talkies]], but with less success.  After the release of ''Citizen Kane'' to relatively positive [[Film criticism|critical]] reviews and largely indifferent popular response, Orson Welles moved on to his second project, ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons]]''.  However, after ''Citizen Kane'' did not become a money-maker, ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was wrested from his control; this time he did not have the right of final cut. RKO re-edited the film itself and released it. William Randolph Hearst died in 1951; Orson Welles died in 1985.

Beavis and Butt-Head Do America
 After a surreal dream of the two of them menacing a city as giants, [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-Head]] wake up to realize that someone has stolen their television. The pair then embark on a quest to find it. After several mishaps they visit a low-quality motel that advertises "TVs in every room". There, they encounter Muddy Grimes, who is waiting for two hired hitmen (later revealed to be the same people who stole the TV) to murder his wife, Dallas. Muddy, thinking that the boys are the killers he has contacted, remarks that they are even younger than he thought they would be and also says that they must "do" (murder) his wife. Thinking that by "do" Muddy is making a euphemism for sex, Butt-Head convinces Beavis that both of them can "score" as well as get paid enough to buy a new TV. Muddy hands them a photo of Dallas with instructions on where to find her. He then drives them to the airport to catch a plane to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].  After arriving in the [[casino]] where they are staying, the boys get arrested by security after being mistaken for trespassers and then they are taken to their rooms. Their room was purchased by Muddy to be adjacent to Dallas's room, and they accidentally burst in. Dallas soon realizes they have no idea what they have been hired for. While Beavis and Butt-Head begin fighting over who will "do" Dallas first, the police arrive to arrest her. Thinking quickly, she plants a stolen [[biological weapon]] known as the "X-5 Unit" in Beavis' pants in order to get rid of it. She then gets them tickets on a bus to [[Washington, D.C.]] instructing them that she will be waiting for them in the [[United States Capitol]] and will let them "do her" there.  The stolen bioweapon attracts the attention of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms|ATF]], headed by Agent Flemming, who orders a [[body cavity search]] on everyone he encounters and in spite of his tough talk, relies on fellow Agent Bork's assistance virtually all the time. Flemming becomes convinced that the duo are criminal masterminds after they accidentally release the water behind the [[Hoover Dam]], cutting the power to Las Vegas. On the tour bus, they visit the [[Grand Canyon]] and [[Yellowstone National Park]]. After becoming stranded in a gift shop at [[Petrified Forest National Park]], they are told Washington is "about 2,000 miles that way" and begin to wander through the desert. While Flemming orders roadblocks for over 200 miles over every road in the desert, the boys meet two former [[Mötley Crüe]] [[roadie]]s who are heavily implied to be their fathers, but part ways before they can make the connection. The boys soon collapse of [[dehydration]]. Delirious from the heat, Beavis unwittingly consumes a [[peyote]] cactus, and has a vivid [[psychedelic experience]] overnight.  The next day, Beavis and Butt-Head are found by Muddy, who plans to kill them after realizing they were not the hit men he hired. However, after hearing that Dallas is going to meet up with the duo in Washington, Muddy decides to take them the rest of the way in his trunk to hunt down Dallas. In the middle of [[Interstate 81 in Virginia|I-81 in Virginia]], Butt-Head opens the trunk with a car jack, and they escape by jumping onto the road, inadvertently causing a 400-car [[pileup]]. Beavis and Butt-Head casually walk past the scene and get back on the tour bus, stopping at the Capitol before finally reaching the [[White House]]. Before Dallas can meet with Beavis and Butt-Head to recover the bioweapon, she is confronted in the parking garage by Muddy. Muddy and Dallas then briefly reconcile before they are arrested by the ATF while having sex in Muddy's car. Faced with the possibility of a 60-year jail sentence, Dallas betrays Muddy by saying that he hid the bioweapon "in some kid's pants", but she still gets the sentence.  The ATF is dispatched to the White House due to Beavis and Butt-Head being there on the same day as a peace conference. Beavis consumes caffeine pills, sugar and coffee while on the White House tour, then transforms into Cornholio. He wanders into the [[Oval Office]] and picks up the [[red phone]], causing the military to go to [[DEFCON 4]]. Meanwhile, Butt-Head runs into [[Chelsea Clinton]]; his attempts at hitting on her lead to him being pushed out of a window and being detained and cavity searched by ATF officers. Beavis leaves the White House and goes inside Mr. Anderson's trailer, where Anderson catches and kicks out Beavis for [[masturbation|"whacking off"]]. The ATF spots Beavis walking around the camper pants-less and confront him, thinking he has the bioweapon on him. They are just about to open fire when Anderson opens his camper door and throws out Beavis's pants. The pants are ripped open by the ATF, with the bioweapon flying out of them. The weapon, landing safely in Butt-Head's hand, is recovered. Blame for the incident is ultimately pinned on Anderson, who's arrested along with Dallas and Muddy. Flemming informs Beavis and Butt-Head that their adventure will remain top secret. The boys are shown seeing [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]], who makes them honorary ATF agents.  Beavis and Butt-Head return to Highland and find their TV in front of the motel. The film ends with them carrying their TV into the sunset while insulting each other, then Beavis suggests going to Anderson's tool shed to masturbate.

Before and After (film)
 In a small Western Massachusetts town, Dr. Carolyn Ryan and her sculptor husband Ben live with their two children Jacob and Judith. Their world is shattered when Sheriff Fran Conklin tells them that Martha Taverner has been killed and witnesses saw Jacob with her just before she died. When he asks to speak with Jacob, the family realizes that he's not in his room as they thought. Conklin asks to look at Jacob's car, but Ben refuses. When Conklin asks Judith where Jacob is, Ben demands the sheriff get a warrant.  When Conklin leaves, Ben inspects Jacob's car, finding clothes and a car jack with blood on them. He burns the clothes and cleans the jack before the police return. When he tells Carolyn what he has done, she is afraid that Ben may have destroyed evidence that could help them find Jacob, as she is fearful that a maniac may have killed both Martha and her son. The Ryans plaster the town with signs trying to find Jacob, but the town ostracizes them, assuming Jacob is a murderer.  Postcards start to arrive from Jacob. Over the course of five weeks, he sends postcards from all over the country. Carolyn is convinced that he's been kidnapped and wants to alert the police. Ben remains wary of disclosing anything, insisting they must keep the postcards a secret. Eventually Jacob is caught and brought back home to stand trial. For the first several days, he is catatonic, only speaking aloud to enter his plea at the arraignment.  He speaks to Judith in their treehouse when she asks him if he really traveled all over the country. He explained that he would take the train to the Boston airport once a week and press the postcards on people who were headed to the cities on the cards. He would explain that he had just returned from a vacation there but forgotten to mail the postcards to his parents, and he did not want them to think he'd forgotten them. The travelers would mail the cards for him when they arrived at their destination.  The family receives a harassing phone call from one of the townspeople. Ben bitterly mocks the caller, but offers an impassioned defense of his son. Touched by his father's sincerity, Jacob opens up and explains what happened.  He had been fighting with Martha when she revealed that she was pregnant, in addition to the fact that she had been sleeping with several other boys. They made up, but while they made love in Jacob's car, they got snowed in. Unable to free the car through a variety of methods, they decided to try to jack one end of the car up while they packed snow under the other end. Their fight reignited and got violent. Martha swung a crowbar at Jacob and missed him by an inch. He charged at her, knocking her to the ground. She landed face first on the jack and was killed. Ben decides that it is best to not reveal the truth. He coaches Jacob on a different version of the story, which they tell to their lawyer, but the plan goes awry when Ben is deposed by the grand jury and realizes that there is no father-son privilege which exempts him from testifying. When Carolyn is called to testify, she reveals the truth. Jacob's lawyer is incensed, but he explains that he will simply treat Carolyn as a hostile witness and her testimony will amount to hearsay, since it conflicts with Jacob's account of the events.  When Ben discovers what Carolyn has done, he is furious. A family argument ensues and in the morning, Jacob is missing again. He turns up at the police station, where he has given a full confession. As a minor, he needs his parents to sign his confession. Ben refuses, explaining that he could never sign anything that took Jacob away from him.  Jacob is sentenced to five years for involuntary manslaughter, but is released after only 2 years with probation, and Ben is sentenced to almost one year for his cover up. The family relocates to Miami.

Armand then tries to coach Albert on how to be straight, but Albert's flamboyant nature makes the task difficult. When Albert realizes his plan won't fool anyone, he takes offense and locks himself in his room.  The Keeleys arrive at the Goldmans (who are calling themselves "Coleman" for the evening to hide their [[Jewish]] heritage) redecorated apartment; they are greeted by Agador, who is passing himself off as a Greek butler named "Spartacus" for the night. Unfortunately, Katherine gets caught in traffic, and the Keeleys begin wondering where "Mrs. Coleman" is. Suddenly, Albert enters, dressed and styled as a conservative middle-aged woman. Armand, Val, and Barbara are nervous, but Kevin and Louise are tricked by the disguise.   Despite the success of the evening, trouble begins when Senator Keeley's chauffeur betrays him to two [[tabloid journalism|tabloid journalists]] who have been hoping for a scoop on the Coalition story. While they research The Birdcage, they also remove a note that Armand has left on the door informing Katherine not to come upstairs. When she finally arrives, she unknowingly reveals the deceptions. Though Armand and Albert scramble to find a new cover story, Val instead confesses to the scheme and identifies Albert as his true parent.  Senator Keeley is initially confused by the situation, but Louise both informs him of the truth and scolds him for being more concerned with his career than his family's happiness. He agrees to the marriage, but discovers that the paparazzi are waiting outside to take his picture. Albert then realizes that there is a way for the family to escape without being recognized: he dresses Kevin and Louise in drag, and they use the apartment's back entrance to sneak into The Birdcage, with Armand introducing them as a part of the club's nightly act. They all dance out of the nightclub door and reach safety, preventing a disaster. Barbara and Val are married in an [[Interfaith officiants|interfaith service]], which both families attend.  
Big Night
 On the New [[Jersey Shore]] in the 1950s, two Italian immigrant brothers from [[Abruzzo]] own and operate a restaurant called "Paradise." One brother, Primo, is a brilliant, perfectionist chef who chafes under their few customers' expectations of "Americanized" [[Italian food]]. Their uncle's offer for them to return to Rome to help with his restaurant is growing in appeal to Primo. The younger brother, Secondo, is the restaurant manager, a man enamored of the possibilities presented by their new endeavor and life in America. Despite Secondo's efforts and Primo's magnificent food, their restaurant is failing.  Secondo's struggles as a businessman render him unable to commit to his girlfriend Phyllis, and he has recently been sleeping with Gabriella, the wife of a competitor. Her husband's eponymous restaurant, "Pascal's", has succeeded despite (or perhaps due to) the mediocre, uninspired food served there. Desperate to keep Paradise afloat, Secondo asks Pascal for a loan. Pascal demurs, repeating a past offer for the brothers to work for him.  This Secondo refuses to do; he and his brother want their own restaurant.  In a seemingly generous gesture, Pascal insists that he will persuade popular Italian-American singer [[Louis Prima]] to dine at Paradise when in town, assuming the celebrity jazz singer's patronage will revitalize the brothers' business. Primo and Secondo plunge themselves into preparation for this "big night", spending their entire savings on  food and inviting people (including a newspaper reporter) to join them in a magnificent feast centered around a [[timballo]], a complicated baked pasta dish. Primo pours his heart into every dish, lavishing care and great expertise on the cooking.  As they wait for Prima and his entourage to arrive, the diners indulge in the exquisite food and partake in a fabulous celebration. Hours pass, however, and it becomes apparent that the famous singer is not coming. Phyllis catches Secondo and Gabriella kissing and runs off to the beach. At Gabriella's insistence, Pascal admits that he never called Louis Prima, thus ending the party.  Secondo follows Phyllis to the beach where they have a final quarrel.  Primo and Secondo have a fiery, heart-wrenching argument, chafing at their mutual differences. In the wee hours of the morning, Pascal admits to Secondo that he set the brothers up for failure; not as revenge for Secondo's affair with Gabriella but because the brothers would have no choice but to return to Italy or work for Pascal.  Secondo denies him, saying they will never work for him.  As dawn breaks, Secondo silently cooks an [[omelette]]. When done, he divides it among three plates, giving one to Cristiano, their waiter, and eating one himself. Primo hesitantly enters, and Secondo hands him the last plate. They eat without speaking, and lay their arms across one another's shoulders.  
Black Sheep (1996 film)
  Mike Donnelly ([[Chris Farley]]), a good-natured but loud and bumbling oddball of his family, is driving an advertisement truck to support his brother Al Donnelly's ([[Tim Matheson]]) campaign for [[Governor of Washington]]. His competition is incumbent Evelyn Tracy ([[Christine Ebersole]]). Mike is chased by dogs while driving and crashes into a local movie theatre. Al's [[campaign manager]], Roger Kovary ([[Timothy Carhart]]), advises Al to get rid of Mike, but Al decides to have Mike campaign for him in town with the assistance of campaign aide Steve Dodds ([[David Spade]]), who accepts the job in return for a spot on Al's staff following the election. As Steve goes to pick up Mike, he hits crazed [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veteran Sgt. Drake Sabitch ([[Gary Busey]]), who ends up stealing his rental car.  Later on, Mike tries to stop underage kids from drinking, but incriminating pictures make it look like he was drinking with them, leading to his termination from a county recreation center. While packing up, he runs into a pair of thugs who set fire to the building, while the same photographer takes potentially incriminating pictures of Mike right after the thugs leave the scene of the fire. However, the first cop to arrive at the scene is Robbie Mighuem ([[Grant Heslov]]), a friend of Mike's who lets him and Steve leave before the police arrive. The two take off in Mike's car and, per Kovary's instructions, head for a shack in rural [[Garfield County, Washington|Garfield County]].  The next day, as Steve and Mike hang fliers, Steve tries to make a call via [[cell phone]]; while looking for a place with reception, Steve stumbles upon the home of the aforementioned Drake Sabitch - an old school bus with a TV, a hammock, a grill, and several weapons. While trying to find a high-ground to get reception on his phone, Steve accidentally loosens a rock in a pile of stones. Later on, as the guys play [[Checkers (game)|checkers]], a huge boulder rolls down the mountain, almost completely knocking their cabin off its foundation; that night, a stormy wind blows the roof away and [[hail]] falls inside. The next day, Mike tries to talk to Al, but Kovary refuses, so Mike decides to head into [[Seattle]] that night to talk to Al, who is going on [[MTV]]'s [[Rock the Vote]] campaign. However, after hanging out with some [[Rastafarians]], Mike makes a fool of himself onstage (culminating to his yelling "KILL WHITEY!" to a suddenly silent audience) as a shocked Al and Kovary helplessly watch. Because of his stunt, Al decides to have Mike to not bother helping him with the campaign, leaving Mike down. The next day, Steve and Mike sneak into Drake's home (after dodging some hidden [[land mine]]s) to watch Al's debate on his TV. When Steve goes outside to use the restroom, he is attacked by Drake, but is saved by Mike, who beats the ex-soldier in unarmed combat. Drake is impressed by Mike's fighting skill and befriends both men.  Governor Tracy, in hopes of sabotaging Al following their debate, purchases the pictures of Mike at the rec center fire and posts them on TV, therefore allowing Tracy to win the election. Mike notices that the total vote count is 1,882 for Garfield County, when in fact there are only 1,502 registered voters there; furthermore, Mike recognizes the two men who set the rec center on fire standing next to Tracy. Mike and Steve go to the Garfield County Courthouse, where they obtain the names of the voters in the election. Steve discovers that over half the people who voted for Tracy have been dead for over ten years (including Drake's father and grandfather), proving Tracy had rigged the elections. To get this to the people and Al, Steve and Mike borrow Robbie's squad car to Governor Tracy's victory party the following day.  At the party, the duo appears during Tracy's victory speech and the police try to arrest Mike for [[arson]]. At the podium, Mike takes a gun from one of the cops and pretends to hold Steve hostage, while Drake shows up in time to prevent a [[sniper]] from shooting Mike and controls the crowd by threatening them with an [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]]. Mike reveals Tracy's [[election fraud]], overturning the election results and making Al the winner.  Three months later, Steve is Al's new assistant, Mike has his job running the recreation center back, and Al has decreased crime rates in Washington. As Al and Steve get into a jet to go to a meeting, Mike's jacket gets caught in the plane's door, causing him to be trapped outside while it takes off.

Their girlfriends Monique and Jen, who are environmentalists, arrive to take them to an Environmental Party when they discover the injured Doyle. The girls learn that the book was used to injure Doyle as an excuse to not go. Annoyed at the boys' lack of respect for the environment, the girls call the boys from a payphone to announce they'll be joining some hot swim team guys at a party down by a lake. Bud and Doyle drive out to the lake, only to find they have been had.  Driving back home, they pass by the Bio-Dome, where scientist Dr. Noah Faulkner is about to seal his team in for a year without outside contact. Mistaking the Bio-Dome for a mall, Bud and Doyle go inside to use the bathroom, to be sealed in along with the scientists. Dr. Leaky, the project's investor, discovers them and demands that they be kicked out. Dr. Faulkner refuses, claiming it would destroy the purpose of the experiment, and so Bud and Doyle remain. Although things go smoothly at first, this proves to be a mistake, as Bud and Doyle continue their antics, harming themselves and destroying many of the scientists' projects. The scientists plead to Dr. Faulkner, but he only relents after the two find a secret stash of junk food and experiment with [[laughing gas]]. Bud and Doyle are then banished to the desert environment section and after three days of being stuck, they discover a key in the lock of one of the windows, which opens a back door, and they escape the Bio-Dome.  As Bud and Doyle are receiving a pizza delivery at the dome, they learn Jen and Monique are attending an environmental party with other men. Bud and Doyle decide to outdo the party and hold one inside the Bio-Dome to win them back. The party backfires as it throws the experiment into chaos and Jen and Monique disavow the boys. The scientists prepare to exit out the desert through the door, but realizing their idiotic actions, Bud and Doyle intervene and demand they all stay and restore the dome to full health, with Doyle swallowing the key as a last resort. The group gets a grip on the situation and begins to fix the dome together, while the boys and the scientists bond with each other as a team, and Bud and Doyle's efforts in restoring the dome soon draw a large group of fans and supporters, with even Monique and Jen joining in as one of the supporters. Meanwhile, Dr. Faulkner, who had disappeared the night of the party, has gone insane and evil and is starting plans to blow up the dome with homemade coconut bombs.   After several months pass and Earth Day approaches, Bud, Doyle, and the team are successful in restoring the dome. But on the night before the doors open again, Bud and Doyle discover Dr. Faulkner, hoping to apologize to him and make amends. He tells the two that he is rigging pyrotechnics for the door opening ceremony and gets them to help plant the bombs. Once Bud and Doyle are on their own with the bombs, they goof off with one of the coconuts and after a failed long pass, they discover their explosive nature. They alert the others and try to exit the dome early, but the door cannot be opened until the clock hits zero, when the bombs will go off. Bud and Doyle run back into the dome to find Dr. Faulkner and get him to deactivate the bombs. They wind up finding him and through a chase and struggle, they knock him out and use the remote to disable the coconuts.  With the Bio-Dome experiment complete, the team gets ready to exit the now open door, but as they begin to walk out, Dr. Faulkner returns with one last coconut bomb, trips, and the bomb detonates at the entrance. It turns out everyone is okay with Bud and Doyle reuniting with Jen and Monique who are proud of what they have been able to achieve. Bud, Doyle, Jen and Monique bid farewell to the Bio-Dome scientists and drive off, where Doyle yet again has to use the bathroom and the car is seen driving toward a mysterious [[nuclear power plant]]. Dr. Faulkner, meanwhile, has escaped the dome through the desert window door, having retrieved the key Doyle swallowed, and flees through the desert as the police are heard searching for him to arrest him for his insane criminal actions.

Bound (1996 film)
  Corky ([[Gina Gershon]]), a lesbian ex-con who has just finished a five-year jail sentence, arrives at an apartment building to start work as a painter and plumber. On her way up to the apartment, she encounters the couple who live next-door, Violet ([[Jennifer Tilly]]) and Caesar ([[Joe Pantoliano]]). After Caesar has gone out, Violet flirts with Corky and asks her to help retrieve an earring that has fallen down her sink. After Corky extracts the earring, Violet admits she lost it on purpose in order to get closer to Corky, and starts to seduce her. They are interrupted by the arrival of Caesar and Corky goes back to work. When she leaves for the day, Violet follows her to her truck. They go to Corky's apartment and have sex. The next morning, Violet tells Corky that Caesar is a money launderer for the Mafia and they have been together for five years.  Later, Violet overhears Caesar and his Mafia associates beating and torturing Shelly ([[Barry Kivel]]), a man who has been skimming money from the business. Upset by the violence and cruelty, Violet seeks solace from Corky. She tells Corky that she wants to make a new life for herself, but that she needs her help. Knowing that Caesar will find the nearly $2 million Shelly took and count it in their apartment, the two women hatch a scheme to steal the money. Corky, already wary of Violet's intentions, is unsure whether to trust her.  Shelly is shot and killed by Johnnie ([[Christopher Meloni]]), the son of Mafia boss Gino Marzzone ([[Richard C. Sarafian]]), and Caesar returns to the apartment with a bag of bloody money. Angry at Johnnie for killing Shelly in a fit of rage and splattering blood everywhere, Caesar proceeds to wash, iron and hang the money to dry.  Violet explains to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie will be coming to pick up the money from Caesar. The plan is as follows: When Caesar has finished counting the money, Violet will get him a drink to relax him before he showers. Corky will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet will drop the bottle of Scotch that is for Gino and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, she will let Corky in, who will steal the money from a briefcase and leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leaving, but that Gino was not with him. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to skip town because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son.  Everything goes as planned until Caesar finds the money gone. He realizes that if he runs, Gino will think he took the money. He decides he has to get the money back from Johnnie. Panicking, Violet threatens to leave. Caesar pulls out his gun and forces her to stay, thinking that maybe she and Johnnie have stolen the money and framed him.  Corky waits next-door with the money while Gino and Johnnie arrive. After watching Johnnie flirt with Violet and taunt him, Caesar pulls out a gun and tells Gino that his son stole the money. In an angry panic, he kills both Gino and Johnnie, and Gino's bodyguard Roy. He tells Violet that they have to find the money, dispose of the bodies, and pretend Gino and Johnnie never arrived, lest their Mafia pals find the money or men missing. Unable to find the money at Johnnie's apartment, Caesar telephones Mickey ([[John P. Ryan (actor)|John P. Ryan]]), a Mafia friend, telling him that Gino has yet to arrive.  After discovering Corky and Violet stole the money, Caesar ties them up, gags them, threatens to torture them, and demands to know where it is. When Mickey arrives to see what is going on, Caesar, panicked, makes a deal with Violet to help him stall. As he prepares to kill Mickey, Violet calls the landline from Johnnie's cell phone and quickly convinces Caesar to pretend that he's on the phone with Gino, who's calling from a hospital to explain that he and Johnnie were in a car accident. Mickey is convinced and leaves for the hospital. Corky tells Caesar where she has hidden the money, and he goes next-door to find it. Violet escapes and makes a phone call to Mickey, telling him that Caesar stole the money and forced her to keep quiet. In the meantime, Corky tries to stop Caesar from taking the money, but he beats her to the ground. Just as he is about to kill her, Violet arrives and pulls a gun on Caesar, telling him that Mickey is on his way and that he should run while he can. Caesar tells Violet that he knows she will not shoot him, to which she replies, "Caesar, you don't know shit", before killing him.  Later, Mickey, who believes Violet's story, tells her that he will find Caesar, and that there is no need to involve the police. Mickey wants Violet to be his girlfriend, but she tells him that she needs a clean break—which she makes by driving off hand-in-hand with Corky.

Boys (1996 film)
 John Baker Jr. ([[Lukas Haas]]) is a boy bored with his life at an [[upper middle class]] boarding school, and the prospect of his future running the family [[grocery store]] chain. He no longer sees the point in school, stating what's the difference if he gets a zero attendance for being three minutes late or skipping the whole class so he might as well skip the class. Now close to graduating from boarding school, his life is turned upside down when he rescues Patty Vare ([[Winona Ryder]]), a young woman he finds lying unconscious in a field.  Patty regains consciousness that evening in John's dormitory.  She stays awake long enough to tell him she will not go to a doctor, and then passes out and does not awaken until the next morning. She seems to recover completely and to be grateful for John's assistance; the two begin a romantic voyage of self-discovery. This is not without its problems, as other boys in the dorm quickly find out she is being hidden in his room, leading up to a dramatic confrontation with Baker's close friends where his 'best friend' becomes enraged and punches a wall, breaking his hand, while the two continue to argue over the reason as to why Baker has hidden her in his room.  Throughout the film, there are continuous [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s of Vare's past, showing her with a famous [[baseball]] player with whom she steals a car, leading up to a drunken car crash and his death (for which authorities are searching for Vare for questioning). By the end, Vare has admitted all this to Baker and informed the authorities of the location of the body and the car (as they crashed into a river). At the police station, both Baker and Vare begin to say goodbye when they unexpectedly jump into an elevator to escape from Baker's controlling father ([[Chris Cooper]]), and drive off with a car he had earlier stolen from the school.

Bounty Hunters (1996 film)
 Jersey Bellini is a bounty hunter who forms an uneasy partnership with a rival to capture a fugitive  
Broken Arrow (1996 film)
 Major Vic Deakins (John Travolta) and Captain Riley Hale (Christian Slater), pilots in the United States Air Force, are assigned to a secret exercise flying a B-3 Stealth Bomber (a fictional iteration of the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] stealth bomber) with two [[B83 nuclear bomb|B83]] nuclear bombs on board. After successfully evading Air Force radar, Deakins attacks Hale and ejects him out of the plane. Deakins then releases the bombs without detonating them and reports that Hale has gone rogue. He then ejects from the plane, leaving it to crash.  A USAF search and rescue team is sent to recover the warheads. Not finding them, they report a "Broken Arrow", a situation wherein nuclear weapons are missing. Next morning the search team locates the warheads in a canyon but is ambushed by mercenaries. Master Sergeant Sam Rhodes ([[Vondie Curtis-Hall]]) tries to disable the warhead but is killed by the other survivor, Sgt. Kelly ([[Howie Long]]), who was actually the mercenaries' mole. Deakins arrives moments later and plots his next move with Pritchett ([[Bob Gunton]]), the mercenaries' financier. They plan to blackmail the US government with the threat of detonating the warhead in a populated area.  Hale has survived the ejection and is almost arrested by park ranger Terry Carmichael ([[Samantha Mathis]]), who had been investigating the unusual events in the park. He convinces her to help him track down Deakins. Deakins' mercenaries commandeer the USAF search and rescue helicopter to kill Hale, but Hale and Terry manage to bring it down. The loss of the helicopter forces Deakins' men to transport the warheads with Hummer trucks.  Hale and Terry carjack the Hummer with the warheads, escaping to a nearby abandoned copper mine, where Hale unsuccessfully attempts to disable them. They then take the armed warhead down the shaft where the mine is deep enough to contain the nuclear blast. However, before they can bring down the second warhead, Deakins' team arrives and secures it. After a gun battle deep in the mines, Deakins shortens the countdown of the armed warhead while leaving Hale and Terry trapped, but they escape via an underground river just before the bomb detonates. The bomb's [[electromagnetic pulse]]  disables the [[Nuclear Emergency Support Team|NEST]] helicopter, allowing Deakins to escape. Terry and Hale track the mercenaries to a motorboat used for transporting the warhead down the river. While trying to steal the boat, Terry is forced to hide onboard and military forces rescue Hale.  Hale deduces that Deakins intends to use a train to transport the warhead. Stowing on the train, Terry tries to sabotage the warhead but is caught by Deakins and is forced to enter the arming code. Catching up on a USAF helicopter, Hale saves Terry before Deakins can throw her off the train. A gunfight ensues and the USAF helicopter crashes, killing most of the mercenaries. Deakins has prepared a remote control that can either disarm or detonate the warhead and gets ready to depart the train on his own getaway helicopter; however, Hale's sabotage of the helicopter's fuel pump causes it to explode, leaving Deakins and Kelly without the means to get clear of the nuclear blast. With his plan falling apart, Deakins decides to arm the warhead regardless with a short countdown timer. Not wanting to die, Kelly holds Deakins at gunpoint and orders him to disarm the weapon. Hale sneaks up on them during their bickering and kicks Kelly out of the boxcar to his death, then engages in a gun battle with Deakins.  Terry detaches the section of the train with the bomb but gets into a shootout with the engineer. The latter is shot and falls on the train brakes, causing the detached boxcars to coast uncontrollably at high speed. Meanwhile, Deakins still has the remote detonator, so he forces Hale to drop his gun and challenges him to a fight. Hale eventually overpowers Deakins, acquires the remote detonator, disarms the warhead and leaps out of the train. As the detached boxcars slam into the halted front half, the warhead flies into Deakins and the entire train derails and explodes.  Hale finds Terry and the damaged warhead. The two formally introduce themselves to each other amidst the wreckage.  
Breaking the Waves
 Bess McNeill is a pretty young Scottish woman with a history of psychological problems. She marries [[atheist]] [[Oil platform|oil rig worker]] Jan Nyman, despite disapproval from her community and her Free Scottish Presbyterian [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] church. Bess is steadfast and pure of heart, but extremely simple and childlike in her beliefs. During her frequent visits to the church, she prays to God and carries on conversations with Him using her own voice, believing that He is responding directly through her.  Bess has difficulty living without Jan when he is away on the oil platform. Jan makes occasional phone calls to Bess in which they express their love and sexual desires. Bess grows needy and prays for his immediate return. The next day, Jan is severely injured in an industrial accident and is flown back to the mainland. Bess believes her prayer was the reason the accident occurred, that God was punishing her for her selfishness in asking for him to neglect his job and come back to her. No longer able to perform sexually and mentally affected by the paralysis, Jan asks Bess to find a lover. Bess is devastated and storms out. Jan then attempts to commit suicide and fails. He falls unconscious and is readmitted to hospital.  Jan's condition deteriorates. He urges Bess to find another lover and tell him the details, as it will be as if they are together and will revitalize his spirits. Though her sister-in-law Dodo constantly reassures her that nothing she does will affect his recovery, Bess begins to believe these suggestions are the will of God and in accordance with loving Jan wholly. Despite her repulsion and inner turmoil to be with other men, she perseveres in her own sexual debasement as she believes it will cure her husband. Bess throws herself at Jan's doctor, but when he rebuffs her, she takes to picking up men off the street and allowing herself to be brutalized in increasingly cruel sexual encounters. The entire village is scandalized by these doings, and Bess is excommunicated. In the face of being cast out from her church, she proclaims, "You cannot love words. You cannot be in love with the Word. You can only love a human being."  Dodo and Jan's doctor agree the only way to keep Bess safe from herself is to have her committed, and as far away from her husband as possible. It is then that Bess decides to make what she thinks is the ultimate sacrifice for Jan: she unflinchingly goes out to a derelict ship full of barbarous sailors, who rape and violently attack her, to which she ultimately succumbs. The church refuses to give a funeral for her and damns her soul to hell. Unbeknownst to the church elders, Jan and his friends have substituted bags of sand for Bess's body inside the sealed coffin.  Jan is later shown burying her in the ocean, in deep grief but substantially restored to health despite the doctors not having thought such possible. The film ends in magical realism as Bess's body is nowhere to be seen on the sonar, and church bells ring from on high in the sky.  
Brassed Off
 Gloria Mullins has been sent to her home town of Grimley to determine the profitability of the pit for the management of [[British Coal]]. She also plays the [[flugelhorn]], and is allowed to play with the local [[British brass band|brass band]] after playing [[Concierto de Aranjuez]] with them. The band is made up of miners from whom she must conceal her purpose. She renews a childhood romance with Andy Barrow, which soon leads to complications. Andy is bitter about the programme of pit closures and determined to fight on, but he is also realistic about the circumstances and predicts a 4-to-1 majority for closure and redundancy. When Andy realises that Gloria is working for management, he accuses her of naïvety for thinking that the Coal Board is considering whether the pit has any viable future and argues that the decision to close Grimley would have been taken years ago. It is later revealed during a confrontation between Gloria and the management of the colliery that the decision to close the colliery had been made two years previously, and that this was to have gone ahead regardless of the findings of her report; the report was simply a public relations exercise to placate the miners and members of the public sympathetic to their plight.  The passionate band conductor, Danny Ormondroyd, finds he is fighting a losing battle to keep the rest of the band members committed. His son Phil is badly in debt and becomes a clown for children's parties, but fails to prevent his wife and children walking out on him. In debt, Phil votes for the redundancy money, which he becomes ashamed of. As Danny collapses in the street and is hospitalised, Phil suffers a mental breakdown while entertaining a group of children as part of a harvest festival in a church. He refers to himself as "Coco the scab"—a name that he had been called by a debt collector who he had asked to wait until the redundancy money had come through. Eventually he attempts suicide by trying to hang himself, but is taken to the hospital. Phil reveals to Danny that in light of the colliery's closure, the band has decided not to continue playing.  When Jim realises that Gloria is working for management, he is unimpressed with Andy's relationship with her.  In a pub conversation, the other miners are not particularly concerned and feel that Jim is being too harsh on Andy.  When Andy says that he should be old enough to make his own decisions, Jim responds with, "Old enough to be a scab then?" This attracts the whole pub's attention, as it signals a serious argument. Jim then withdraws the insult and says that Andy is just "stupid". Later on in the film, Jim asks Gloria to leave the band and mocks her attempts to fund the band's trip to the National Finals.  With the intention that it will be their last performance, the band, in full uniform, and wearing their miners' helmets and lamps, plays "[[Danny Boy]]" late at night outside the hospital. Andy, having lost his tenor horn in a bet, whistles along with his hands in his pockets. After they finish, they all switch off their lamps.  Whilst the band is playing in the National Semi-Finals, the outcome of the ballot is announced as 4-to-1 in favour of redundancy, as Andy had predicted.  (It is later implied that, of the five miners who make up the main characters, four of them had voted for redundancy and only Andy had voted for the review procedure.)  After Gloria sets up a bank account to fund travel to the National Finals, the band is brought back together to compete. Andy wins his tenor horn back in a game of pool, and having forgiven Gloria, after she gives them the money she was paid to compile the report (saying she does not want it because it's "dirty money"), the band travels to the final at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]] ([[Birmingham Town Hall]] was used to film these scenes),<ref name=locations/> where they are amused by the inability of the woman on the dressing room's PA system to pronounce 'colliery'. Before departing, Phil leaves a note for Danny saying that they are going to the finals. Danny arrives just in time to see the band win the competition with a stirring rendition of the ''[[William Tell Overture]]'', during which Phil notices his wife and children are in the audience. Danny refuses to accept the trophy stating that it is only human beings that matter and not music or the trophy and that "this bloody government has systematically destroyed an entire industry. ''Our'' industry. And not just our industry—our communities, our homes, our lives. All in the name of 'progress'. And for a few lousy bob." However, following this gesture, another band member takes the trophy anyway. The band celebrates their victory as Andy and Gloria kiss on the upper deck of an open-topped bus travelling through London, while the rest of the band play [[Land of Hope and Glory]] conducted by Danny.  
Broken English (1996 film)
 Nina is the daughter of Ivan, a fierce Croatian patriarch whose family immigrated to [[Auckland]], New Zealand to escape the war. She works as a waitress in a restaurant and falls in love with Eddie, a [[Māori people|Māori]] chef, despite her father's objections. For a price, she agrees to marry a Chinese co-worker so that he (and his Chinese wife) can establish permanent residency. The money gives her the independence she needs to leave her parents' house and move in with Eddie. Complications arise when Eddie realises the depth of her father's fury and the strength of Nina's family ties.  
Broken Silence (1996 film)
 The [[Carthusian]] monk Fried Adelphi has spent 25 years in a Swiss monastery, keeping his vow of silence and meditation, when his prior instructs him to go and seek the owner of their monastery, in order to extend an expiring 100-year lease. The owner is a vulcanologist; she now lives a secluded life in the mountains of Indonesia. Released from his vow of silence, Fried starts his journey and experiences the culture shock to be expected already in the plane: he loses his wallet, which his seat neighbor, Ashaela, an African American drummer from New York, silently takes. Suffering from claustrophobia, Fried leaves the plane at the Delhi stopover, to continue his travel by sea, but now he has no money. Ashaela offers him a ride to town. Thus begins a journey that will take them both to various parts of India and to Indonesia.  Fried must learn to adapt his dress rules to the Asian climate. Ashaela eventually admits the origin of the travel funds. We learn she suffers from an incurable disease and may die anytime now. The Carthusian monk throws overboard what is too much of monastic rules and habits, and with Ashaela's help, he eventually fulfills his assignment. Soon after, he cremates the woman's body at a palm tree oceanfront, according to her will, but against his own religious beliefs and a Church interdict. Before ending his journey, Fried goes to New York, to bring back a pair of drumsticks to Ashaela's friend. Then Fried visits a local church to confess. Here begins the film: the Carthusian confesses piece by piece what happened to him and what he did; the impatient New York priest listens only reluctantly at first, then becomes gradually interested. The viewer experiences the road movie at the same pace, in flashbacks.  
The Cable Guy
 After a failed marriage proposal to his girlfriend Robin Harris, Steven M. Kovacs moves into his own apartment. Taking advice from his friend Rick, Steven bribes cable guy, Ernie "Chip" Douglas, to give him free movie channels, which he does, after fixing Steven's television and trying to find the electrical problem behind the wall while muttering sexual innuendos. Chip gets Steven to hang out with him the next day in the local satellite dish and makes him one of his "preferred customers".  Chip takes Steven to the [[satellite dish]] responsible for sending out television signals. Steven tells his problems with Robin to Chip, who advises him to admit his faults to Robin and invite her over to watch ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]].'' Steven takes Chip's advice, and Robin agrees to watch the movie with him. Chip begins acting more suspiciously, running into Steven and his friends at the gym (Chip amuses Steven and his cohorts by destroying the backboard of the basketball hoop) and leaving several messages on Steven's answering machine. When Robin arrives to watch the movie, the cable is out, due to Chip, who intentionally sabotaged Steven's cable. Chip fixes the cable under the condition that they hang out again, to which Steven agrees.  Chip takes Steven to [[Medieval Times]], where Chip imitates [[Hannibal Lecter]] by covering his face with turkey skin and arranges for them to battle in the arena, referencing the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "[[Amok Time]]". Chip behaves aggressively, nearly killing Steven, who eventually bests him in combat. When they arrive at Steven's home, Chip reveals that he's installed an expensive [[home theater system]] in his living room, which includes a television and a karaoke machine.  Chip and Steven later host a party attended by Chip's "preferred customers" (mostly elderly citizens). Chip sings the song "Don't You want Somebody to Love" by [[Jefferson Airplane]] (Clearly a reference to Chip's emotional desire for human contact) on the karaoke machine. Steven decides to enjoy the party and with Chip's help, Steven sleeps with a young party guest named Heather, who later Chip reveals is a prostitute and Steven throws Chip out.  Chip tracks down Robin, who is on a date with another man. Chip enters wearing a crudely fashioned disguise consisting of a mustache and sunglasses. When the man goes to the bathroom, Chip severely beats him while using puns about "freshening up" and tells him to stay away from Robin. He later upgrades Robin's cable, saying that it is on Steven, as well as telling Robin an anecdote about a loved one who died as a result of poor relationship communication. Robin decides to get back together with Steven as a result.  However, Steven tells Chip that they cannot be friends, which sets a hurt Chip on a series of vengeful acts. He gets Steven arrested for possession of stolen property at the moment that Steven makes a big business deal. During his time in jail, he is visited by his parents and Chip, who mocks him through a prison visitation window. Steven tries to alert a guard about Chip, but the guard is one of Chip's "preferred customers" and thus does not react. After a weekend of humiliation, Steven is released on [[bail]].  During a dinner with his family and Robin, Steven is horrified to see Chip in attendance. Steven tells him to leave, but Chip tells him to play along or he will show everyone a picture of Steven with the prostitute. The evening goes from bad to worse when Chip manipulates the family, tells several bad jokes, and eventually pushes Steven too far by playing a sexualized version of the game show [[Password]] with the rest of the family. Steven flies into a rant about Chip's true intentions but nobody believes him. Chip whispers something disturbing about Robin into Steven's ear, which results in Steven punching Chip in the face, shocking everyone else. Chip complies and leaves, feigning depression. Steven is fired from his job the next day when Chip sends out a video of Steven insulting his boss that was recorded on a hidden camera in his apartment.  Steven has a nightmare about Chip breaking down his door and chasing him out of the window in the middle of the night, with eerie green eyes. After doing some investigating, Rick tells Steven that Chip has been fired from the cable company for [[stalking]] customers, and uses the names of television characters as aliases such as Chip Douglas from ''[[My Three Sons]]'' and Larry Tate from ''[[Bewitched]]''. Chip calls Steven that night, telling him he is paying Robin a visit. After visiting Robin's empty apartment, Steven tracks them down to the satellite dish, where Chip holds Robin hostage in a rainstorm.  After a physical altercation and a chase, Steven is able to save Robin. As the police arrive, Chip goes into a speech on how he was raised by television and apologizes to Steven for being a bad friend. Chip dives backwards from the top of a ladder above the satellite dish, falling onto it and knocking out the television signal to the entire town, just as the verdict in a highly publicised trial similar to the "[[Lyle and Erik Menendez]]" killing is about to be revealed. One viewer, realising that his television is unfixable, decides to read a book instead.  Ben Stiller portrays the killer, a former child star in a fictional sitcom about twins. The murder trial has several references prior to this scene, including a cheesy commercial about a sensationalized [[docudrama]] based on the trial which bears resemblance to sketches from [[The Ben Stiller Show]], as well as a news clip which replays Stiller's phony call to 911 following the murder of his identical twin brother.  Chip survives the fall and avoids the satellite's middle spike, much to his dismay, and injures his back. As Steven and Robin reunite, Steven forgives Chip and asks for his real name. Chip jokingly replies "[[Ricky Ricardo]]". Chip is then taken to the hospital in a helicopter, while the ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' theme plays in the background. When one of the paramedics addresses him as "buddy", Chip asks the paramedic if he is truly his buddy, to which the paramedic replies "Yeah, sure you are", causing Chip to smile deviously, hinting that the paramedic is about to be his next victim.

Moses is brought into custody, and he agrees to testify against Colton, but the trial takes place at the other side of the country. After Jack's recovery, his superior officer, Will Jensen, orders him to get Moses to transfer him personally to the courtroom.

Colton learns through bribed federal agents and LAPD officers of Moses' attempt to testify against Colton. Carter and Moses slowly mend their friendship, and are successful in returning to their local police department. However, Colton apparently holds Flynn hostage, and blackmails Carter into turning Moses over in order to save Flynn.

It is later revealed that Flynn was responsible for leaking Carter's and Moses' whereabouts to Colton, and was actually on his payroll.  A traitor in an innocent view. Carter manages to distract Colton after Moses gets shot in the shoulder by Colton, and, after apprehending Flynn, Moses manages to kill Colton.

Bullet (1996 film)
 Butch "Bullet" Stein ([[Mickey Rourke]]) is a 35-year-old Jewish ex-convict and junkie, who is released from prison after serving a 8-year sentence for being an accomplice to a robbery, perpetrated by his friend, [[Irish-American]] gangster Paddy. After his release, Bullet and his best friend Lester ([[John Enos III]]) rob two teenagers for drugs. He also robs and stabs in the eye drug runner Flaco ([[Manny Perez]]), telling him to let his boss Tank ([[Tupac Shakur]]) know Bullet is back. He returns to [[Brooklyn]] to live with his dysfunctional family, including his alcoholic father, depressed mother and his two brothers, the older mentally unstable Vietnam veteran Louis, and his younger brother Ruby, an aspiring graffiti artist.  Tank is a local drug kingpin with a score to settle after Bullet stabbed him in the eye while they were serving time together. Bullet seems to welcome the challenge. Tank first pressures Paddy to find and deliver Bullet to him. Later, he tries to have him killed by having one of Paddy's dealers sell Bullet drugs laced with poison. This fails when the drug spot is robbed by gunmen, one of whom stabs Ruby through the hand with a knife in the process.   Over the course of the film, Bullet keeps himself occupied by shooting heroin and robbing his neighbor's house for jewelry, which he and Lester sell to an [[Italian-American]] gangster named "Frankie Eyelashes" ([[Larry Romano]]). He also encourages Ruby to follow his artistic dreams and has a deep friend-to-friend talk with Lester over whether Lester might be a closeted homosexual because of his mother abandoning him and his father's passing when he was a child, but he vehemently denies.  After the first failed attempt to kill Bullet, Tank gets one of his henchmen to start a fight with Bullet, which is witnessed by Louis. The fight ends in a draw when the henchman breaks his hand. Paddy figures out Tank's attempt to kill Bullet and that he is trying to play him and his associates against one another. He and his henchman Big Balls ([[Donnie Wahlberg]]) confront Tank about it, in the process killing two of his henchmen, including High Top ([[Michael K. Williams]]).  Bullet briefly returns home where he tells his mother he's sorry for everything he put her through over the years. He later goes to a nightclub with Ruby and Lester. Paddy tries to help him escape because Tank is on the way to kill him. Bullet then accepts his fate when he is cornered by Tank and his men and has a final showdown with Tank, who shoots him dead to Ruby's horror.   Soon after Bullet's funeral, Louis gets revenge by sneaking up on an unsuspecting Tank as he tries to enter his club and proceeding to cut Tank's throat, killing him. Louis then leaves Bullet's pet rat (named after [[Tony Curtis]]) on the dead body, exclaiming "Payback's a motherfucker" (a line which Tank said to Bullet when he had his henchman battle Bullet). The final shot of the film ends with Louis watching as Bullet's rat is about to feast on Tank's corpse.  
Butch Camp
 Matt Grabowski (Denniston) is a passive [[closet]]ed gay man who works as a loan officer in a bank. He awakes one morning to find that his roommate has moved out, stealing all of his furniture. He's assigned a loan application for Mister Pickwick, an important client, and pressured to approve it despite the client not really qualifying. He's forced to take the client out to a stripper bar and after an uncomfortable time there, he's [[gay bashing|gay bashed]] on his way home. All of these incidents inspire Matt to sign up for "Butch Camp" to learn how to stand up for himself. Butch Camp is run by Samantha Rottweiler (Tenuta), a Teutonic lesbian who puts campers through a regimen of physical training, self-defense instruction and verbal abuse designed to toughen them up. Rottweiller characterizes straights as "the enemy" and under the theory "know thy enemy" requires campers to learn straight lingo (mostly slang terms for vaginas and sports terminology).  Rottweiler sends campers out on "assignments" in the straight world, like making them hang out in straight bars. On one such assignment, Matt meets hairdresser Janet Cockswell (Roberts) and her boyfriend Rod (Teresi). He becomes friends with Janet; Rod is initially somewhat resentful of him but eventually warms up as the three hang out more. Matt finds himself developing a crush on Rod.  Janet, not realizing Matt is gay, sets her sights on him. Janet gets him to her salon under the false pretense of a fight with Rod and seduces him. Rod finds out about it and he and Janet argue, with dialog implying that Rod might be gay himself.  A day or two later, Rod runs into Matt and confronts him. As they start to talk it out (with Rod implying that he knows Matt is gay) they're suddenly confronted by an armed robber who inexplicably forces them to strip before running off. Shaken, the guys go to Matt's place and have some drinks. They talk and Rod, noticing that Matt is bruised and sore, offers him a back rub. The massage becomes more sensual until Rod becomes ill. Suddenly Janet shows up. Rod hides while Janet tries to seduce Matt again, but Matt [[coming out|comes out]] to her instead and she leaves, but only after Matt agrees to remain friends with her. Rod, blaming the alcohol, also leaves.   At work, Matt refuses to approve the questionable loan and the bank manager fires him. Depressed, he avoids Rod and Janet for weeks. Meanwhile, Rod breaks up with Janet and comes out to one of his friends, who drops him. Rod sneaks into Matt's apartment. Rod wants to be with Matt but Matt is worried about having his heart broken again. Rod leaves with the situation unresolved.  Matt's preparing for his Butch Camp "final exam" (three hours in a bar where gay bashers hang out) while trying to get a hold of Rod and to decide whether to help his old bank with a sting operation against Mister Pickwick. On his way to the exam he stumbles across his old manager, [[transvestite|cross-dressed]], being beaten by the same basher who attacked Matt. Using what he learned at Butch Camp, Matt defeats the basher. Rod, hearing of Matt's actions, tracks him down. They reconcile over a romantic dinner and dance together at the restaurant. They go back to Matt's place and make love.  Matt helps his old bank execute the sting and his boss, grateful for his help and for his rescue (and discretion), hires him back with a promotion. Back at work, Matt spots a Butch Camp flyer on a co-worker's desk and smiles encouragingly. At Butch Camp, Matt graduates and is awarded the "Medal of Honor" for removing the basher from the streets. The film closes with the Butch Camp graduates marching in Chicago's annual [[gay pride parade]].

Cannes Man
 Frank 'Rhino' Rhinoslavsky (Quinn) is a dumb part-time cab driver in [[New York City]] who wants to break into film business. He doesn't have anything to offer, and just thinks that he can start at the top, as a writer. Opportunity knocks on Frank's door when he goes to the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in [[Cannes, France]] to deliver some props to Troma, Inc.  So, he meets Sy Lerner (Seymor Cassel), perhaps a bigger loser in movie business and as each person interviewed in this mockumentary, he has made a fool out of a lot of industry executives and cost them plenty of money. Lerner makes a bet with his friend that he can take any shmoe off the street and turn them into the biggest success around. And Frank is his shmoe. 'Rhino' is going to create the same success by letting others do all the work.  Sy Lerner takes on Frank as his pet project. He shows Frank how to dress and behave, tells him how to respond when being interviewed such as never saying too much, and always being ambiguous. Then Sy Lerner comes up with the vehicle for Frank's reputation, by naming him the writer of a new movie. Only the movie doesn't exist and Frank isn't a writer. And, even knowing Lerner's reputation, people buy into the garbage. And now, everyone wants a piece of that action. Lerner and Frank (now given a fitting industry name of "Frank Rhino") have everyone knocking down their door, popular directors, big name producers, and famous actors (including Johnny Depp and Jim Jarmusch). Interviews, press opportunities, everything: Frank is the "Cannes Man," and he didn't have to do much to get it. So, they are at the Cannes Film Festival. It's where deals get made, producers get laid, and stars get paid. It's where all the movie industry meets to buy and sell all the movies on the planet. And it's where the art of the deal can be filled with more laughs than the deal itself.

Carnosaur 3: Primal Species
 In the opening sequence, an army convoy is attacked by terrorists who soon discover they have stolen a truck of living frozen biological material instead of uranium. Once at a dockside warehouse, two frozen [[Velociraptors]] and a huge [[T-Rex]] escape and kill many of the terrorists before the police arrive, who expect to find drug smugglers. After finding the sole survivor, the police are killed inside the warehouse by the Velociraptors. An anti-terrorist special force led by Colonel Rance Higgins is called in by General Mercer where they find pieces of bodies and a refrigeration truck rather than uranium. They maneuver through warehouse boxes until two get slashed to death. The survivors learn from Dr. Hodges that these are the last three "carnosaurs" in existence: two male Velociraptors and one female T-Rex (the same dinosaurs in the convoy) left from the genetic reconstructions of the previous Carnosaur installments. It is made clear that the dinosaurs need to be caught alive, relating to the potential for curing major diseases. A massive meat shipment resides at the dock, so the three soldiers hunt in that area, meeting up with a unit of [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]]s who have come as backup. Soldier Polchek is given drugs to shoot into the carnosaurs as the group set up a lure and net trap with meat. One of the Velociraptors attacks and almost succeeds in dragging off Polchek, but is shot down. They soon take the raptor back to the base for further examination.  Hodges soon theorizes that the T-Rex is breeding since Polchek was being dragged off, perhaps to hatchlings. The next plan is to destroy the ship they're on in the Pacific and freeze the dinosaurs somehow. However, the Velociraptor awakens and begins to attack. The T-Rex also appears and bites off a soldier's head before escaping with the Velociraptor. When time comes to explore the lower decks of the ship, the carnosaurs knock out the lights and kill a couple more soldiers. The rest get to an elevator, but a Velociraptor chews the cable through and they crash on the bottom level, discovering the nest of eggs which they begin to shoot, angering the T-Rex, who soon bites off Polchek's arm and then eats him. Rance and Proudfoot rejoin Dr. Hodges and Marine Rossi, split up again and rig dynamite. The T-Rex bursts through the ceiling and drags Rossi through it before eating him. The two Velociraptors attack, one rips off Proudfoot's head and the other is shot to death before the other raptor is also shot. Hodges senses the T-Rex is close. She and Rance hide behind lockers which the T-Rex head-butts. Rance throws an explosive in the mouth of the dinosaur, killing it. The two race against time to jump in the ocean before the ship explodes. Back in the police car at the port, the sole surviving terrorist is still gagged in the back seat when a third Velociraptor soon appears outside the vehicle and eats him, foreshadowing that the prehistoric terror is not over yet.<ref></ref>

Celtic Pride
 Best friends for life, gym teacher Mike O'Hara ([[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]]) and plumber Jimmy Flaherty ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) are united by their love of Boston and its sports teams, especially the Boston Celtics, who are playing their last season in the old [[Boston Garden]]. When the Celtics drop Game 6 of the NBA Finals to the Utah Jazz, setting up a deciding Game 7 in Boston, Mike and Jimmy find themselves depressed and hopeless. On top of all this, Mike has moved back in with Jimmy after his wife Carol, fed up with his unhealthy obsession with the Celtics, left him and took their son Tommy with her. Jimmy and Mike stumble upon the Jazz's selfish, one-man-show shooting guard Lewis Scott ([[Damon Wayans]]) at a Boston nightclub. Hoping at first to get him drunk enough so he'll be hungover for Game 7, Mike and Jimmy pose as Utah fans. This however leads to them running into their idol [[Larry Bird]] (as himself), who scolds them for being what he thinks are "fair weather" fans. However, the pair get more than they bargained for when the next morning they end up kidnapping Scott after he wakes up at Jimmy's apartment. The two decide to hold Scott until after the game, reasoning that if they are going to prison, they might as well help the Celtics win in the meantime.  Scott's streetwise, arrogant ways contrast with Jimmy and Mike's bumbling blue-collar lifestyle. He derides them for being washed-up losers, and insinuates Mike is only after him because he is jealous of Scott's fame and ability. Mike, on the other hand, berates Scott for his behavior on and off the court, including starring in a campy [[Oscar Mayer]] hot dog commercial and skipping practices. Scott attempts to turn Jimmy against Mike, and, when this fails, escapes, only to be foiled by an antagonistic cabbie and a local cop, Kevin ([[Paul Guilfoyle]]), both fellow Celtics fans.       Ultimately, Mike challenges Scott to a game of one-on-one and the pair is incapacitated well before the final game is set to begin. Before he runs off, Scott presents the pair with a dilemma, they must root for him and hope the Jazz win, otherwise he will turn them both in to the police. Mike reconciles with his wife and son, knowing he might be going to prison, and Jimmy says goodbye to his grandmother. At the game, the two convince the other Celtics fans they are only pretending to root for the Jazz, and the first half ends with the Celtics leading. Mike, who knows the Jazz are losing because Scott refuses to pass the ball, gives him a pep talk from the stands, and Utah closes the gap to one point with a little over 7 seconds remaining. With one play left and the Jazz with the ball, Mike and Jimmy choose life over the Celtics, rooting for Utah and rushing the court after they win. Approached by Kevin who earlier ignored his cries for help, Lewis denies Mike and Jimmy committed the kidnapping, saving them from prison.  A few months later, Mike has promised his wife he would never interfere with an NBA Finals game again. But now it's football season. He and Jimmy sneak into the hotel room of [[Deion Sanders]] at 3:00&nbsp;a.m.  
Chain Reaction (1996 film)
 Eddie Kasalivich ([[Keanu Reeves]]) is a [[student]] [[machinist]] working with a team from the [[University of Chicago]] to obtain clean energy from water by efficiently splitting the [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] atoms from the water molecules. While working at home, Eddie inadvertently discovers the secret: a frequency that enables a perfect stabilization of their process. The machine is perfected the next day in the lab and everything appears to be working and stable. To celebrate, a party is thrown in the lab. That night after the party, project physicist Dr. Lily Sinclair ([[Rachel Weisz]]) tries to leave the lab but her car battery is dead. Eddie offers to take her home by taxi; but, later says they took a bus. Back in the lab, Drs. Alistair Barkley and Lu Chen are on their computers preparing to upload their discovery to the Internet so the world can share in this new discovery, speaking [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Meanwhile, a van is seen driving toward the lab. Chen hears a noise and goes to investigate, but is kidnapped by unknown assailants as Alistair also comes under attack.  Meanwhile, Lily and Eddie arrive at her house and after making sure she is okay, Eddie heads back to the lab to get his motorcycle. As he arrives at the lab, he sees a van leaving and hears alarms coming from the lab. He runs inside to find Alistair with a plastic bag over his head and Chen nowhere to be found. The hydrogen reactor is dangerously unstable and Eddie is unable to shut it down. Realizing the reactor is going to overload, he speeds away on his bike as a concealed detonator triggers a massive hydrogen explosion that destroys the lab and surrounding streets. As rescue crews arrive, Eddie is questioned by the police and later the [[FBI]] about what happened the night of the blast. Upon returning with Lily to their homes, they realize that they are being [[Frameup|framed]] as fake evidence is planted in both of their houses.  Both go on the run and head to an observatory belonging to Maggie McDermott, an old friend of Eddie's. After resting up, they contact Paul Shannon ([[Morgan Freeman]]), the man funding the project (along with [[DARPA]]), but they're almost caught in the process and barely manage to escape. As Eddie and Lily are evading more police, Paul meets with Lyman Earl Collier ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]) at C-Systems Research complex to discuss the current events. It becomes apparent that the plot to destroy the lab and frame Eddie and Lily for it was orchestrated by the company, and that Lyman is responsible. Despite some disagreement, Paul and Lyman decide to continue the hunt for Eddie and Lily, a task made easier when Eddie sends a coded message to Paul requesting another place to meet. At this new rendezvous, Paul reveals he was involved, but wants to talk somewhere else. The meeting ends in an ambush, and Lily is captured as Eddie barely escapes.  By tracing the license plate on the van used in the ambush, Eddie is able to track them to the C-Systems Research facility where Lily and Chen are being held. When C-Systems' test reactor fails again, Paul, the scientists, and the prisoners all leave the room, so Eddie takes the opportunity to "fix" the system. The next morning, one of the other scientists discovers the working reactor and everyone celebrates. Paul is suspicious, and immediately obtains a download of the working data, and secretly gives it to his assistant, Anita, for safekeeping. He then finds Eddie at a computer in the company boardroom. There, Eddie demands to be let go in exchange for making the reactor work. Paul agrees but Lyman refuses, believing that the process already works, so Eddie sets the reactor to explode while sending proof of his innocence to the FBI and blueprints of the reactor to "hopefully a couple thousand" international scientists. Lyman responds by shooting Chen dead, then leaving both Eddie and Lily to die in the explosion as he, Paul, and their staff flee the site, setting [[lockdown]] doors on the way.   Paul shoots Lyman for overstepping the bounds of the program, leaving his body in an elevator to be [[incinerated]] in the ensuing [[Conflagration|inferno]]. During his own escape, Paul deactivates the containment, letting Eddie and Lily escape, and Lyman's remains to be destroyed. As he is doing this, Eddie and Lily struggle with one of Lyman's henchmen over an ascending construction lift, ending in Eddie and Lily climbing aboard it, moments before a [[blast wave]] sweeps into the tunnel. Both Eddie and Lily survive the shockwave to be met by FBI agents now convinced of their innocence, who take them to safety. Paul departs the scene via chauffeured sedan. He is last seen dictating a memo to Anita. The memo informs the Director of the [[CIA]] that C-System is "...no longer a viable entity. Will be in contact."

The Chamber (1996 film)
 [[File:MississippiStatePen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mississippi State Penitentiary]], the setting of the film]]  In April 1967, the office of Marvin Kramer, a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] [[lawyer]] in [[Indianola, Mississippi]], is bombed by the [[Ku Klux Klan]], killing Kramer’s five-year-old twin boys and leading to the amputation of Kramer’s legs and his later suicide.  Klansman Sam Cayhall (Hackman) is tried for murder in the bombing, and is eventually convicted and [[capital punishment in the United States|sentenced to die]] in the [[gas chamber]] at the [[Mississippi State Penitentiary]].  Twenty-nine years later, in 1996, Adam Hall (O’Donnell), a young attorney at the [[Chicago]] [[law firm]] of Kravitz and Bane, seeks assignment to the firm’s [[pro bono]] representation of Cayhall in the last weeks before his scheduled execution.  Adam is Sam Cayhall’s grandson, his family having since moved away from [[Southern United States|the South]] and changed their name, haunted and shamed by Cayhall’s crime.  Adam is motivated to take the case in a search for some understanding of the dark secrets of his family, which prompted the suicide of Adam’s father the year Sam was sentenced to death (and whose body Adam found as a child).  Adam is sent by the firm to [[Jackson, Mississippi]] to take over the case and there reconnects with his aunt Lee Bowen (Dunaway), an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] [[socialite]] who has managed to avoid public association with her infamous father, and who warns Adam about the dangers of dredging up the past.  On [[death row]], Sam remains a brusque, bitter, unrepentant racist who brags about his participation in the Klan bombing campaign of which the Kramer bombing was a part, though he denies that any of the bombings were intended to kill.  He taunts Adam for his youth, legal inexperience, anti-racism, and the suicide of his father, but he agrees to allow Adam to represent him, though he forbids Adam from seeking [[pardon|clemency]] from Mississippi Governor McAllister, who had prosecuted Sam in his last retrial and had campaigned on that prosecution in his election to Governor.  Nevertheless, as he begins to argue the case, Adam is approached by the Governor through an aide, Nora Stark (Rochon), who suggests that the Governor might consider clemency if Sam provides information about unidentified co-conspirators to the bombing.  As Adam investigates, inconsistencies in the facts of the original case come to light, casting doubt on Sam’s intent to kill and suggesting that he lacked the ability to make the bomb himself, and both Stark and the original [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent who investigated the case indicate that the bombing may have been the result of a broader conspiracy involving the [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]] and [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens' Councils]], which were active at the time of the bombing in opposition to civil rights.  Sam refuses to authorize Adam to seek access to the Sovereignty Commission’s files, sealed by order of the [[Mississippi Legislature|state legislature]], fearing it would expose Sam’s former associates in the Klan, as well allowing the Governor to obtain useful information on political enemies, which he indicates is the Governor’s real reason for seeking Sam’s cooperation in unsealing the files.  Adam continues to work through the courts, filing and arguing motions for a [[stay of execution]], including on the grounds that Sam was [[insanity defense|legally insane and unable to tell right from wrong]], due to his indoctrination into the Ku Klux Klan.  At the same time, Lee, faced with the unearthed ghosts of the family history and having lapsed back into full-blown alcoholism, reveals to Adam that in the early 1950s, as children, she and Adam’s father had witnessed their father murder the family’s African-American neighbor, Joe Lincoln, during a fight that had started because Adam’s father, Eddie, had wrongly accused Lincoln’s son of stealing a toy soldier.  Eddie had blamed himself for the murder, as well as Lee, for failing to stop Sam, the guilt of which was a factor in Eddie’s later suicide and Lee’s alcoholism.  Lee also reveals how their father had been indoctrinated into the Klan as a child, showing Adam an historic photograph of Sam as a young boy attending a Klan [[Lynching_in_the_United_States|lynching]] (which Adam uses in his arguments before the courts).  Adam and Nora secretly gain access to the Sovereignty Commission’s sealed files, which prove a wider conspiracy to the bombing, and also indicate the participation of an accomplice.  The former FBI agent resurfaces, and reveals to Adam that the FBI had identified the accomplice, Rollie Wedge, whom the FBI had never been able to prove responsible, but who has reunited with other Klan members to commemorate the bombing on the eve of the pending execution.  Adam goes to the Klan reunion and is beaten by several Klan members, and threatened at gunpoint by Wedge.  Adam’s persistence, the revelation of how much Sam’s hatred had destroyed his family, and his impending execution begin to affect Sam, and he softens, reconciling with Lee and expressing remorse for his actions and the effect they have had on his family.  Sam forcefully rejects the Klan when Wedge visits him in prison to encourage him to remain silent, and it is revealed that Wedge was the one who had built the bomb and set it deliberately to kill.  Ultimately, Adam’s motions for a stay are denied by the courts, including the [[Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States|United States Supreme Court]]. Despite Sam’s finally authorizing the release of relevant Sovereignty Commission files, the Governor refuses to grant clemency, betraying him and Adam, while nonetheless using the files as political leverage (as Sam had predicted), though Wedge, identified in the files, is finally arrested.  Ultimately, Sam is executed in the gas chamber, though Adam remains as a confidant and advocate for his grandfather up until his execution, and he and Lee embrace at the end, in the hope that maybe the ghosts of the past are gone.

Chronicle of a Disappearance

Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering
 Grace Rhodes is a [[medical student]] who returns to her hometown of [[Grand Island, Nebraska]], to take care of her [[agoraphobic]] mother, June ([[Karen Black]]), who refuses to leave her yard. She is having recurring nightmares of being attacked by children. Grace also has to look after her younger siblings James and Margaret. She takes a job at Dr. Larson's local clinic, where she'd worked prior. James and Margaret become ill and show symptoms similar to those of the children in June's dreams. The next day, while working at Dr. Larsen's office, Grace notices that many other kids have the same symptoms. During the night all of the kids in town get worse as their fevers skyrocket. Suddenly it all stops and the fevers begin to drop.  Local parents Donald ([[Brent Jennings]]) and Sandra Atkins notice that their son Marcus is acting strangely. One night, a group of children descend upon the house led by a [[child preacher]], and Sandra is murdered in front of Marcus. The police arrive and begin to question Donald; Marcus flees into a field, and is chased by a sheriff, who is confronted by the child preacher and killed. A suspect in his wife's murder, Donald goes into hiding, and is taken in by two elderly sisters, Jane and Rosa ([[Marietta Marich]]).  The children stop answering to their names and claim to be someone else. Dr. Larson, a longtime resident, recognizes the identities that the children are using as those of dead children from the town's history. Dr. Larson is killed by two of the children in his office one night. When Grace arrives the next day, Dr. Larson has vanished, and the blood tests of the children reveal inexplicable signs of death and decay. June has her recurring nightmare again, only to discover that she is not dreaming and that it is actually happening. She flees her house and drives away. June spots James entering an old barn and she follows him inside. She is captured and killed by the child preacher, after which children begin to gather at the barn.  Grace decides to go to Dr. Larsen's house to find him. Donald hijacks her and her car and forces her to drive at gunpoint. They go to Jane and Rosa's house. Rosa reveals that the child preacher, Josiah, was the bastard son of a local woman. He was taken in by traveling preachers and became a very gifted preacher. Over the years, Josiah never grew out of boyhood and stopped aging. The traveling preachers gave him over to darkness to stunt his growth, but when word got out, they abandoned him. Josiah killed the preachers and then the townspeople burned him alive and sealed his remains in a well.  Meanwhile, Grace's best friend Mary Anne, also an employee at the clinic, is attacked and killed by Josiah. Grace and Donald return to the clinic and discover Margaret is missing, but they learn that Josiah's weakness is [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. It is also revealed that Josiah is Rosa's son. Margaret, James, Marcus, and all the other children gather at the barn and offer blood to Josiah. Marcus is a [[hemophiliac]], meaning he will bleed to death if he gets even a small cut. Marcus, however cuts his hand, offering his blood to Josiah, and Margaret offers Josiah her soul. Marcus collapses from blood loss and Margaret is pulled into the pool of blood, from which Josiah emerges.  Donald and Grace arrive at the barn. They connect the barn's sprinkler system to their supply of mercury. Donald fills two of his bullets with mercury and gives the gun to Grace. Donald stops Marcus' bleeding, but the children try to kill him. Josiah attacks Grace, but she shoots him with a mercury bullet. She then finds June's and Dr. Larsen's body. Josiah attacks her again, but Grace activates the sprinklers which shower him with mercury. Grace slashes him with his own scythe, finally killing him. The children stop trying to kill Donald and return to normal. Grace finds Margaret, apparently drowned, but manages to revive her.  It is revealed that Margaret is actually Grace's daughter, and that she abandoned her with June as a teenager. After the funerals for the victims, Grace, Margaret, James, Donald, and Marcus all move out of Nebraska.

City Hall (film)
  In [[New York City]], Detective Eddie Santos and mob figure Tino Zapatti kill each other in a shootout; a stray bullet also kills a child passing by. In the wake of the tragedy, questions are raised as to why Judge Walter Stern, an old friend of the ambitious [[Mayor of New York City|Mayor]] John Pappas, had previously set the criminal responsible free on [[probation]]. Pappas' loyal [[Deputy Mayor of New York City|deputy mayor]], Kevin Calhoun, decides to dig for answers. Meanwhile, legal aid Marybeth Cogan uncovers a conspiracy to smear Santos.  Calhoun's investigation leads to Frank Anselmo, a [[Brooklyn]] politician who has connections to Tino's uncle, crime boss Paul Zapatti. Anselmo plants money at Zapatti's behest to frame Santos. Calhoun and Cogan continue to seek the truth from a number of sources, including Santos' partner and another Zapatti relative. After the murder of probation officer Larry Schwartz, they ultimately conclude that Judge Stern had to be on the take. Pappas agrees that Stern must resign.  The scandal snowballs to the point where Zapatti instructs Anselmo to commit suicide rather than become an informer or go to jail. To protect his family, Anselmo shoots himself. Calhoun uncovers evidence that Pappas put Stern together with Anselmo to receive a [[bribe]] and leave the young Zapatti on the street. Calhoun soon tells Pappas there is only one choice—to quit as mayor and leave politics for good. ("You're gonna take yourself out, John. You're gonna take yourself out.")  
Citizen Ruth
 The movie opens with Ruth Stoops and a man (apparently an ex-boyfriend) having intercourse on a bed in a [[flophouse]], after which he disrespectfully throws her out of the apartment. She later goes to a hardware store to buy patio sealant and [[Inhalant|huffs]] it in a paper bag in an alley to get high. Ruth is portrayed as a dumb, inebriated addict, capable of doing nearly anything to get money or drugs.  Ruth has 4 kids, all of whom have been taken from her custody by the state because of her inability to care for them (or even for herself). Her kids are scattered among three different homes. Ruth goes to the home of her brother and sister-in-law to sneak a look at two of her kids and to beg her brother for money.  After Ruth is arrested for her continuing drug use, she learns that she is [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] again. At her arraignment, she learns to her horror that she is facing [[felony]] charges; her many earlier arrests had all been on [[misdemeanor]] charges. The [[judge]], who knows of the situation with Ruth's other offspring, suggests to her after the hearing that he will deal with her less harshly if she has an [[abortion]]. Through a chance encounter with a group of jailed abortion protesters, Ruth soon finds herself at the center of an escalating battle between people on both sides of the abortion issue. Both sides engage in deceitful tactics to influence Ruth's decision. The [[pro-life]] people run a fake [[abortion clinic]], where they actually seek to dissuade patients from receiving the advertised service. The [[pro-choice]] people have "spies" in the pro-life group who spirit Ruth away.  Both sides offer incentives into the thousands of dollars to the hapless and exhilarated woman to secure her promise that she keep or abort the child. Dollar-conscious Ruth rampantly encourages the bidding. She becomes the object of a local news and political obsession; a figure of the media who all want to know: Will she or won't she have an abortion?  On the day Ruth is to receive her abortion, she suffers a [[miscarriage]]. Going along with the pretense of having the abortion, she proceeds to the clinic to collect $15,000 that has been left there for her by one of the security guards of the clinic who believes in personal freedom. He has personally given her the money, free of organizational sponsorship, to match the bid given by the Pro-Life group, so that she can make her decision without the influence of money. She then breaks out of the clinic by dropping a toilet tank cover on a guard's head and walks by oblivious protesters on both sides. Even though she'd been on the TV news for weeks, none of the picketers on either side pay any attention to her actual presence. Finally standing up, she runs away down the street.

Conspirators of Pleasure
 In [[Prague]], Mr. Pivoňka, an unmarried man, buys some pornography from his local newsagent, Mr. Kula, and returns home. A postwoman, Mrs. Malková gives him a letter which reads "On Sunday" in cut-out letters. In secret, she then rolls pieces of bread into little balls and carries them in her satchel. Pivoňka asks his neighbour, Mrs. Loubalová, to slaughter a chicken for him. Using the leftover feathers and [[papier-mâché]] made from the pornography, he constructs a chicken head and fabricates wings made from umbrellas. Meanwhile, police captain Beltinský buys rolling pins and pan lids from the same shop that sells Pivoňka's umbrellas. Using these items, plus stolen pieces of fur and sharp things, Beltinský constructs unusual objects in his workshop. His wife, a newsreader named Beltinská, feels neglected and buys some live carp. She is unaware that Kula is in love with her image and has constructed a machine rigged to stroke and masturbate him when she is on television. Pivoňka and Loubalová construct life-size [[effigies]] of each other.  On Sunday, Pivoňka drives to the country with his effigy while Loubalová takes her effigy to an abandoned crypt containing a closet, a chair with candles and a basin of water. Loubalová emerges from the closet and whips her straw effigy which, being animated, reacts. Pivoňka dresses in his chicken outfit and struts around his similarly animated effigy, eventually crushing it with a boulder while Loubalová drowns hers in the basin. At home, Malková shoves an unfeasible number of bread balls in her nose and ears and takes a nap. While Beltinská strokes her carp and feeds them the bread balls Malková later delivers, Beltinský strips naked in his workshop and rubs his objects over his body. When Beltinská reads the news, Kula turns on his machine and climaxes at the same time that she does, stimulated by the carp sucking her toes under her desk.  On his way home, Pivoňka is fascinated by Beltinská's image in a television shop window and stops to buy electronic equipment magazines at Kula's shop. Kula is now covering rolling pins with feathers; Malková looks longingly at a carp in a fishmonger's windows. Pivonka discovers that Loubalová has been killed in her flat by a boulder that has seemingly dropped through her roof; Beltinský is investigating. Entering his own flat, Pivonka sees the chair with candles and the basin of water awaiting him. His closet door slowly opens...

The Craft (film)
 Sarah Bailey, a troubled teenager, has just moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles with her father and stepmother. At her new school, she forms a friendship with a group of girls rumored to be witches, Bonnie, Nancy and Rochelle. At the same time, Sarah becomes attracted to the popular Chris. Bonnie, Nancy and Rochelle worship a powerful deity named "Manon".  Sarah exhibits supernatural powers from the onset of the film, and her new friends believe that she will complete their [[coven]], making them all powerful. When Sarah is harassed by a vagrant with a snake (whom she had encountered before in her new house), he is immediately hit by a car and the girls believe that together they willed it to happen. It is also revealed that Sarah has attempted suicide in the past (presumably because of difficulty in controlling her magic).  After a date with Chris, Sarah is upset to find that he has spread a false rumor that they have had sex. When Sarah confronts him, he treats her disrespectfully in front of his friends. In response, Sarah casts a love spell upon him—while Rochelle casts a revenge spell on hateful racist bully Laura Lizzie, Bonnie casts a spell for beauty, and Nancy for power. It very soon becomes clear that the spells have been successful: Chris becomes infatuated with Sarah, scars that Bonnie has on her back [[miraculously]] heal, and Rochelle's bully, Laura, begins to lose her hair. Nancy goes further by causing her abusive stepfather to have a heart attack and die. This enables Nancy and her mother to cash in on his life insurance policy and move out of the trailer park they had been living in and into a better home.  Nancy becomes greedy for power and encourages the others to join her in a rite called "Invocation of the Spirit". On completion of the spell, she is struck by lightning. Afterward she [[psychopathy|lacks empathy]] and begins taking risks with her life and those of others.  The spells that the girls have cast soon begin to show negative consequences: Bonnie becomes aggressively narcissistic; Rochelle finds Laura Lizzie traumatized by her baldness and sobbing hysterically; Chris attempts to rape Sarah when she rejects his continual advances. In retaliation, Nancy uses a glamour spell to make herself look like Sarah, attempting to fool Chris into having sex with her. She is interrupted by the real Sarah who tells Nancy to leave with her. Upset at being fooled, Chris tells Nancy that she is jealous. Nancy then uses her power to kill Chris by throwing him out of a window.   Sarah performs a binding spell to prevent Nancy from doing more harm, but this does not work and the coven turns on Sarah. They invade her dreams, threaten her and use their powers of illusion to make Sarah believe that her father and stepmother have been killed in a plane accident. They torment her with visions of swarms of snakes, insects and rats, as well as making her believe she is responsible for Chris's and her mother's death when giving birth to her, trying to persuade her to commit suicide, before Nancy cuts Sarah's wrists herself. Although she is initially terrified, Sarah successfully "invokes the spirit" and is able to heal herself and fight back. She scares off Bonnie and Rochelle by bringing their worst fears to life, and defeats Nancy—binding her power to prevent her from doing harm.  Nancy is committed to a psychiatric hospital; Bonnie and Rochelle are now powerless, while Sarah is the only coven member who still has her powers.  
Courage Under Fire
  While serving in the [[Gulf War]], Lieutenant Colonel Serling ([[Denzel Washington]]) accidentally destroys one of his own tanks during a confusing night-time battle, killing his friend, Captain Boylar. The [[US Army]] covers up the details and transfers Serling to a desk job.  Later, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden ([[Meg Ryan]]) should be the first woman to receive a ([[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]]) [[Medal of Honor]]. She was the commander of a [[Medevac]] [[UH-1 Iroquois|Huey]] that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]]. When she encountered a [[T-54]], her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a [[flare gun]]. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and when the survivors were rescued the next day, Walden was reported dead.  Serling notices inconsistencies between the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario ([[Matt Damon]]), the medic, praises Walden strongly. However, Staff Sergeant John Monfriez ([[Lou Diamond Phillips]]) claims that Walden was a coward and that he led the crew in combat and improvised the fuel bladder weapon. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and unconscious throughout. Furthermore, the crew of the Black Hawk claim that they heard firing from an [[M16 rifle|M16]], but Ilario and Monfriez deny they had one.  Under pressure from the [[White House]] and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg ([[Michael Moriarty]]), to wrap things up quickly, Serling leaks the story to a newspaper reporter, Tony Gartner ([[Scott Glenn]]), to prevent another [[cover-up]]. When Serling grills Monfriez during a car ride, Monfriez forces him to get out of the vehicle at gunpoint, then commits suicide by driving into an oncoming train.  Serling tracks Ilario down, and Ilario finally tells him the truth. Monfriez wanted to flee, which would mean abandoning Rady. When Walden refused, he pulled a gun on her. Walden then shot an enemy who appeared behind Monfriez, but Monfriez thought Walden was firing at him and shot her in the stomach, before backing off. The next morning, the enemy attacked again as a rescue party approached. Walden covered her men's retreat, firing an M16. However, Monfriez told the rescuers that Walden was dead, so they left without her. [[Napalm]] was then dropped on the entire area. Altameyer tried to expose Monfriez's lie at the time, but was too injured to speak, and Ilario was too scared of the court-martial Walden had threatened them with and remained silent.  Serling presents his final report to Hershberg. Walden's young daughter receives the Medal of Honor at a White House ceremony. Later, Serling tells the truth to the Boylars about the manner of their son's death and says he cannot ask for forgiveness. The Boylars tell Serling he must release his burden at some point and grant him their forgiveness.   In the last moments, Serling has a flashback of when he was standing by Boylar's destroyed tank and a medevac Huey was lifting off with his friend's body. Serling suddenly realises Walden was the Huey pilot.

While recovering, Ballard meets Remington again, as well as a man named Vaughan ([[Elias Koteas]]), who takes a keen interest in the brace holding Ballard's shattered leg together and photographs it. While leaving the hospital, Remington and Ballard begin an affair, one primarily fueled by their shared experience of the car crash (not only do all of their sexual assignations take place in cars, all of Remington's off-screen sexual encounters take place in cars as well). In an attempt to make some sense of why they are so aroused by their car wreck, they go to see one of Vaughan's cult meetings/performance pieces, a re-creation of the car crash that killed [[James Dean]] with authentic cars and stunt drivers. When Department of Transport officials break up the event, Ballard flees with Remington and Vaughan.  Ballard becomes one of Vaughan's followers who [[Sexual fetishism|fetishize]] car crashes, obsessively watching car safety test videos and photographing traffic collisions. Ballard drives Vaughan's [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln convertible]] around the city while Vaughan picks up and has sex with street prostitutes and, later, Ballard's wife. In turn, Ballard has a dalliance with one of the other group members, Gabrielle ([[Rosanna Arquette]]), a beautiful woman whose legs are clad in restrictive steel braces and who has a [[vulva]]-like scar on the back of one of her thighs, which is used as a substitute for a vagina by Ballard. The film's sexual couplings in (or involving) cars are not restricted to heterosexual experiences. While watching videos of car crashes, Remington becomes extremely aroused and gropes the crotches of both Ballard and Gabrielle, suggesting an imminent [[ménage à trois]]. Later, Vaughan and Ballard eventually turn towards each other and have sex while, also later, Gabrielle and Remington have sex with each other.  Though Vaughan claims at first that he is interested in the "reshaping of the human body by modern technology," in fact his project is to live out the philosophy that the car crash is a "fertilizing rather than a destructive event, mediating the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity that's impossible in any other form."  The film's climax begins with Vaughan's death in an intentional crash.  It ends with another deliberate crash where Ballard rams his wife's car, as she unbuckles her seat belt intentionally. As he caresses her bruised body on the grass median near the crash, she replies that she is unhurt.  As they lovingly copulate under the overturned car, the film ends with Ballard whispering in her ear, "Maybe the next one", implying their fetish involves death.  
A Couch in New York
 Henry Harriston is a psychoanalyst whose patients are driving him crazy by constantly leaving him messages during his off hours. On a whim he places an ad offering up his apartment for a housing swap. Béatrice Saulnier ([[Juliette Binoche]]) a Parisian dancer responds to his ad and without meeting the two switch apartments. Béatrice is impressed with Henry's high-tech apartment which is both beautiful and spacious. Henry meanwhile is horrified when he arrives in Béatrice's apartment and finds it filthy and messy.  Meanwhile, Henry's patients, who Henry sees at home, begin coming to his apartment seeking therapy. Béatrice begins listening to their stories, and the patients accept her as Henry's temporary replacement.  At Béatrice's apartment Henry discovers a cache of love-letters written to Béatrice by various men. Béatrice's lovers also begin showing up in her apartment and talking to Henry about their love for her. When they begin calling the apartment telling Henry how helpful he was and how they want to talk to him again he turns tail and returns to New York.  Originally intending to simply pick up his mail, Henry notices that his patients keep coming in and out of his apartment and, when he tries to enter his apartment, is pushed out by Béatrice's friend who is posing as her receptionist. Believing that Béatrice is intentionally running a scam, he goes to confront her, posing as a fake patient, John. Instead of confronting her however, he keeps up the ruse of being a patient, but is unable to talk and the session consists of Béatrice and Henry saying "Yes" back and forth at one another. Despite this, the two find themselves attracted to one another and the session ends with Béatrice suggesting that Henry, as John, come back. Henry meanwhile is convinced that Béatrice really does mean well and decides to keep up the ruse and continue seeing her.  After a particular session in which Henry talks about his distant relationship with his mother, both Henry and Béatrice begin to think they've fallen in love with one another. Henry refuses to say anything, feeling too cowardly, while Béatrice's friend tells her she cannot be involved in a relationship with a patient. Béatrice and Henry become close and continue to feel strongly towards one another. During one of their sessions the light turns off and both secretly whisper love confessions in the dark, but neither hear's what the other is saying. Henry's friend urges him to run to Béatrice or write her a letter but as these are all things that Béatrice's previous lovers have done that have failed, Henry refuses. He decides that the only way the situation will be resolved is if Béatrice confesses her love to him. Instead she calls him late at night to tell him their sessions must come to an end as she is returning to Paris. Henry tells Béatrice he loves her, but she hangs up before she hears what he has said.  Henry rushes to the airport hoping to get a last minute flight to Paris. Unfortunately, the plane is overbooked. Henry decides to wait on standby. He is able to get the last ticket as one passenger has not shown up, however that ticket belonged to Béatrice, so while Henry flies to Paris, searching the plane, looking for Béatrice, Béatrice stays behind.  Eventually arriving home, Béatrice realizes she cannot go to her apart as Henry is still in her apartment and goes to stay with her neighbour. On her neighbour's terrace she sees her plants which have flourished in her absence. She strikes up a conversation with Henry, who she cannot see through the plants. He disguises his voice so she will not recognize him. Talking to Henry through the plants Béatrice confesses that she came early because she had fallen in love with one of Henry's patients, John.  Realizing that Henry and John are one and the same person, Béatrice climbs over the terrace back into her apartment and kisses Henry, telling him she loves him.  
Cosi (film)
 [[Ben Mendelsohn]] stars as Lewis Riley, an unemployed young man who applies for a job as a director/drama teacher at a mental hospital. He lands the job and finds himself directing a production of the [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] opera ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', an elaborate, demanding piece of theatre, an opera in Italian. And it is going to be performed by a cast that he must select from among the patients, who only speak English.  One of the patients, Roy ([[Barry Otto]]), sweeps everything along before him, organising auditions, selecting cast members, and criticising the director. The cast chosen include three women: Julie ([[Toni Collette]]), Ruth ([[Pamela Rabe]]), and Cherry ([[Jacki Weaver]]); and two men: Henry ([[Paul Chubb]]) and Doug ([[David Wenham]]). The musical director is Zac ([[Colin Hay]]). The enthusiasm of Roy infects the group, and they charge headlong into a memorable production.  Alongside the story of Lewis, the theme of ''Così fan tutte'' is explored as it relates to his personal life. Lewis's relationship with his girlfriend Lucy ([[Rachel Griffiths]]), already under pressure, is not helped by a friend called Nick ([[Aden Young]]), who seems more interested in testing Lucy's faithfulness than anything else.  The story is loosely based on Nowra's own experience at producing ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' at [[Plenty, Victoria|Plenty]] Mental Hospital in suburban Melbourne in 1971.<ref>[http://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/C219445 ''Cosi''], [[AustLit: The Australian Literature Resource|AustLit]] </ref>  
Crayon Shin-chan: Great Adventure in Henderland
 A prince named Gorman fought with a dragon to save Henderland's princess Memory Mimori, but got captured by the evil magic of Joma and Makao (who are transgender magicians). Meanwhile, Miss Yoshinaga was telling a princess story to the Futaba Kindergarten kids. The school organised a trip to a theme park called Henderland and all kids went on a train ride. But soon after, Shin-chan got lost and met Cre.G.Mad (who actually was a werewolf). Shin-chan then meets Toppema Muppet, a dancing doll. Shin-chan winds her key. Just then Cre.G.mad transformed into a wolf and chased them. After escaping from him, they meet Chokirin, a subordinate of Joma and Makao. She has an erotic appearance which Shin-chan gets attracted to. She and Toppema end up with a magical fight. Shin-chan then leaves home. On TV, he sees the Japanese singer and model [[Akiko Hinagata]] who was singing "Six Colors Boy" song (which is the ending theme of this movie).  At night Toppema meets Shin-chan while he was taking a bath. She explains the evil plans of the transgender magicians and the witches, and requests him to help. Shin-chan gets scared and refuses, but she left behind magical cards. Shin-chan tested the cards and thought of [[Akiko Hinagata]]. She really appeared in front of him in a swimsuit, and Shin-chan gets elated. Meanwhile, the witches sent Su Noman Par (a snowman with body temperature of -100 degree Celsius) to capture Shin-chan. He reached Kasukabe by train and knows Shin-chan's address with help of Masao. He reached Shin-chan's kindergarten and claimed to be a teacher. Shin-chan met him in the washroom and gets scared. Later he saw him in his own house talking with his mom. His dad and mom talked with him till late night and drank beer.  Just when all the bottles are finished, the snowman out of magic created two beer cans which after drinking, Misae and Hiroshi fall asleep (he had sleeping pills mixed deliberately).The snowman entered Shin-chan's bedroom to capture the magical cards from him. Shin-chan used the magical cards to call Action Kamen, Kantam Robo and Buriburizaemon to fight (Buriburizaemon at first took the rival's side and charged money,but after receiving few kicks decided to help them). Their fighting techniques failed, but Shin-chan's plan of rubbing their behinds against the Snowman's body worked. It started melting and it ran away, but left behind a letter inviting Shin-chan's parents to Henderland. The next day, the parents and Shin-chan went to Henderland. While returning, Shin-chan's parents went to the toilet leaving Shin-chan behind, and got caught by the Snowman, who sends two magic robotic puppets in place of them. While bathing, Shin-chan gets scared when he sees that his parents' genitals were missing. Just then the two attack Shin-chan, but in time he was saved by Toppema. She then explained that Shin-chan had to go alone to Henderland to save his mom and dad from the evil clutches of the magicians. He practices the card magic and goes to Henderland alone by train. At first on the rail tracks he confronted Cre.G.Mad who transformed into a wolf. Shin-chan used the magic cards to transform into a cable train and created a detour rail track which directly led inside the castle gate.   Seeing the wolf chase him with a steam train, he again uses cards to call Action Kamen, Kantam Robot and Buriburizaemon. Buriburizaemon came up with a plan, and opened a way a to create an obstacle for Cre.G.Mad clash against him. Unfortunately, the plan fails as there was no one to change the way, but at the last minute Toppema changes the wolf's track and he falls into water. When the wolf was beaten, it loses its shirt and gets transformed into Hiroshi. Shin-chan uses cards and for the second time Akiko Hinagata appeared in a swimsuit again (the thoughts of the person holding the magic cards becomes reality), and meets Hiroshi. Shin-chan then transformed into a plane and began to fly over the park but they were followed by Chokirin. He called the trio superheroes but they fell down as it was to heavy to fly. Meanwhile, Toppema diverted Chokirin's attention and started fighting near a decorative globe. While Shin-chan and Hiroshi recover from the fall, the balloon bursts and Chokirin only descends. She tries to take the letters to Shin-chan but at the last moment Toppema appears, and thanks to power of the cards, she gets Chokirin wrapped in a halo of light due to which Chokirin gets destroyed but soon Toppema also gets weak and fades out. Shin-chan cries and from his tears comes out Misae. The three are directed to the castle where Joma and Makao receive them with a dance show. After that Hiroshi becomes an executive salaryman, Misae in a refined housewife dress and Shin-chan in a Kindergartener's uniform. They come forward to attack Makao and Joma but are repulsed with ease. Then they are challenged to a dance competition where Nohara family wins narrowly by 0.1 marks. Then they are invited to a game of cards which Hiroshi won with a great effort.   But when Joma and Makao seemed to have some evil intention Shin-chan used the Joker card and came out Majin, the spirit of wild, who stopped him and explained that to defeat Joma and Makao he must reach the top of the castle and place the Joker card in the center of the park. After a great persecution, Makao and Joma are destroyed and the castle begins to crumble. Luckily they reached an emergency airlock and escaped. Then Snowman Par apparently came to attack but princess Memory Mimori casts a spell. The Snowman melts and was discovered that it was the prince. She said that she was actually Toppema and thanked Shinnosuke for his help by him a kiss on his cheek. Then the princess and prince marry happily and Henderland becomes a happy place again.  
The Crow: City of Angels
 In [[Los Angeles]], mechanic Ashe Corven ([[Vincent Pérez]]) and his eight-year-old son Danny (Eric Acosta) are murdered by notorious drug kingpin Judah Earl ([[Richard Brooks (actor)|Richard Brooks]]) after they witness a gang of Judah's henchmen murdering a fellow drug dealer. The two are then dumped into a harbor.  Sarah from the first film ([[Mia Kirshner]]) is now an adult, working in a tattoo parlor by day, and painting surreal images of death and resurrection in her apartment at night. She is haunted by disturbing dreams about Ashe and Danny, and after a day's work in the tattoo parlor, Sarah is visited in her apartment by a large crow as she contemplates a ring that Eric Draven gave her years before.  Sarah follows the crow to the harbor at night on [[All Saints' Day]], and witnesses Ashe's resurrection and frantic escape from his watery grave. She takes him to her apartment. When Sarah tells Ashe he is dead, he panics and runs screaming into the night, ending up at his own home, where he relives the final moments of his life.  Sarah arrives there to find Ashe brooding, and she explains to him why he has been resurrected by the Crow so he can take revenge against the criminals who killed him and Danny. With the guidance of the crow, Ashe starts killing Judah's henchmen, one by one. Ashe first visits Spider-Monkey ([[Vincent Castellanos]]) in a drug warehouse and interrogates him as to who else was involved in the murders. Ashe then kills him by blowing up the building. Another of Judah's lackeys, Nemo ([[Thomas Jane]]), is spending the night at a [[Peep show#Pornographic shows|peeping booth]]. Ashe appears in the booth, and kills him, leaving a doll stuffed in his pants with a paper crow in his mouth.  Judah has in his employ a blind prophetess named Sybil ([[Tracey Ellis]]) who is able to ascertain Ashe's link to Sarah and to the crow that is the source of his powers. Judah captures Sarah in order to draw Ashe to him and steal his power.  One of the murderers, Kali ([[Thuy Trang]]), goes to Sarah's apartment to draw Ashe out. While battling her, Ashe realizes that Kali is the one who killed Danny; enraged, he throws her against a wall that breaks her leg, and then out a window, leaving a crow-shaped blood pattern. Ashe then pursues Judah's right-hand-man, Curve ([[Iggy Pop]]), in a motorcycle chase. Ashe shoots Curve's motorcycle, which blows up and throws Curve onto the road. Ashe then drags Curve into the nearby river, leaving him to die as local parishioners cast down flower petals in the shape of a crow.  On the day of the annual [[Day of the Dead]] festival. Judah captures the crow and impales its wings with knives before killing it. He then ingests the crow's blood, stealing Ashe's power. Suddenly mortal, Ashe nearly dies from the shock, but is revived after seeing a vision of Danny telling him to keep fighting. Ashe must now attempt to rescue Sarah by seeking out Judah in his lair, an abandoned church. Judah gets the best of the weakened Ashe in the ensuing fight. Judah ties a rope around Ashe and savagely whips him, intending to hang him.  Sarah rushes up and stabs Judah in the forehead, causing Judah to drop Ashe. Judah pulls out the knife and starts moving toward Ashe. Sarah gets in the way, and Judah stabs her in the stomach. Ashe gets up and impales Judah on a metal pipe, but this does not kill Judah either. While Judah is still impaled, Ashe calls upon a murder of crows, which devour Judah. Sarah dies in Ashe's arms, a tableau reminiscent of a painting she had completed earlier in the film. Ashe returns to death, knowing that he can rest in peace with Sarah, and his son.  
Curdled (film)
 Gabriela ([[Angela Jones]]) is a [[Colombians|Colombian]] immigrant living in [[Miami]] who has been fascinated with violent death ever since she saw a falling corpse pass by her mother's bakery window as a child. With many television shows and films feeding her obsession, she believes that after someone is decapitated, they still talk for a short while afterwards.  Having quit her job at a bakery, she begins work for a cleaning service, after she sees a television commercial advertising it.  The service is headed by a man named Lodger ([[Barry Corbin]]), who specializes in mopping up what is left behind at crime scenes. She goes to the office, inquires about a job and later is (to the dismay of Elena ([[Mel Gorham]]), her cleaning partner) offered the opportunity to clean up after an execution by her favorite at-large serial killer, The Blue Blood Killer ([[William Baldwin]]) (so named because his victims are all wealthy women).  The two women go to the scene of the crime and begin cleaning up the mess. Elena diligently works away, trying to get out of there as soon as possible; meanwhile Gabriela discovers what she believes to be the name of the serial killer - "Paul Guell" - beneath a pool of blood, but covers it up so that Elena won't see and think she is weird. Due to the amount of blood, they have to leave and come back the next day.  While out on a date with ex-colleague Eduardo ([[Bruce Ramsay]]), Gabriela reveals to him what she found out and after failing to clearly explain, convinces him to go to the house that same night, before it all gets cleaned up.  Unbeknown to Gabriela and Eduardo, the killer is still in the building after accidentally locking himself in the wine cellar while trying to escape. Gabriela opens the door to the cellar, when Eduardo freaks out and decides he wants to go, leaving the door ajar and the killer an escape route. Eduardo leaves when Gabriela refuses to go with him, and she picks up a knife, dancing around the house where the blood is, acting out what she thinks happened - all while the killer watches.  When Eduardo returns after a second thought, the killer hits him over the head and hides him in the wine cellar. He soon stops Gabriela and forces her to walk him through what happened, checking that she knows the full story, and when they come to the end, they briefly argue about Gabriela's theory of heads talking after decapitation. The killer then decides it's time for Gabriela to die, but in a struggle, he slips and is knocked out on the tiled floor.  When he begins to come to, Gabriela, out of sheer curiosity, picks up the knife and cuts his head off. She slowly lifts up his head and he mumbles her name, to which Gabriela smiles with satisfaction. In a [[post-credits scene]] Gabriela and Eduardo are driving in a car and Gabriela plays the tape which recorded the killers last word after beheading.  
The Crucible (1996 film)
 Early one morning in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts]] in 1692, some young village girls meet in the woods with a Barbadian slave named [[Tituba]]. One of the girls, [[Abigail Williams (Salem witch trials)|Abigail Williams]], kills a chicken and drinks the blood, wishing for John Proctor's wife to die. They are discovered by Abigail's uncle, [[Samuel Parris|Reverend Samuel Parris]]. As the girls run away, Parris' daughter Betty falls over unconscious.  Parris questions Abigail about the events that took place in the woods; Betty will not awaken, nor will Ruth, the daughter of Thomas and Ann Putnam, who was also dancing. This strikes Mrs. Putnam hard as she had seven other children before Ruth who died at childbirth. The Parris household is also visited by Giles Corey, who suspects that the children are just acting out, and John Proctor, with whom Abigail had an affair and whose wife she wants dead. Abigail still loves Proctor, but Proctor has realized his mistake and left her. The Putnams and Reverend Parris believe that Betty and Ruth are [[Demonic possession|demonically possessed]], so they call [[John Hale (Beverly minister)|Reverend John Hale]] from Beverly to examine Betty. To save herself and the other girls from punishment, Abigail claims that Tituba was working with the [[the devil|devil]]. After being whipped, Tituba confesses to being a [[witch]], and is saved from being hanged. Struck by their new power, the other girls begin naming other women whom they "saw" with the devil, including Elizabeth Proctor, John Proctor's wife.  John, determined not to give his former lover her vengeance, insists that his servant, Mary Warren, one of the "afflicted" girls, testify [[Salem witch trials|in court]] that the [[witchcraft]] was faked. Although Mary Warren is frightened of Abigail, she eventually agrees. In the court, Francis Nurse gives a list of names of people who vouch for the accused; in response, the judges order that all on the list be arrested and brought in for questioning. Giles Corey insists that when Ruth Putnam accused [[Rebecca Nurse]], Mr. Putnam was heard to tell his daughter that she had won him a "fine gift of land". Corey refuses to name the person who heard this remark, and the judges order Corey's arrest. Meanwhile, Mary Warren insists she only thought she saw spirits but is later cowed by the other girls into recanting her recantation. Elizabeth Proctor says she is pregnant and will be spared from death until the baby is born, but he insists on charging the girls with [[false witness]].  The other girls are called in and asked if they were lying about the witchcraft but cause a commotion, screaming that Mary Warren is putting a spell on them. To demonstrate that Abigail is not innocent, John confesses to having had an affair with her. He claims that Abigail accused Elizabeth in order to get rid of her so that she could marry him. Abigail denies the accusation to protect her reputation, so Elizabeth is called in to see if the accusation is true. However, not knowing that John confessed and wanting to save his reputation, she lies. As Reverend Hale tries to persuade the court that John is being honest, the girls turn the court further against the Proctors by screaming that Mary Warren is attacking them in the form of a yellow bird. Although John correctly believes that they were pretending, as he had previously accused, the girls create another commotion, running outside from the bird into a nearby lake, making the court think that they are honest. To save herself from being hanged as a witch, Mary Warren accuses John of witchcraft. When asked if he will return to God, John despairingly yells "I say God is dead!" and is arrested as a witch.  On the day before John Proctor is to be hanged, Abigail attempts to convince the court that Reverend Hale's wife is also a witch (because Hale was the lone person in the town who doubted her claims).  However, this plot backfires as the judges do not believe her: a minister's wife is considered to be pure. In time, the girls become outcasts and Abigail steals Reverend Parris' money to catch a ship to flee to Barbados, but not before asking John to go with her, telling him she never wished any of this on him. He refuses stating "It's not on a boat we'll meet again, but in Hell". On the eve of John's hanging, Parris, fearing that his execution will cause riots in Salem directed at him, allows John to meet with Elizabeth to see if she can make her husband "confess" to save his life. John agrees and writes the confession. The judges insist that the confession must be publicly displayed with his own signature to prove his guilt and to convince others to confess, but John angrily shouts "Leave me my name!" and tears up the confession, determined to keep his name pure for his sons. He is taken away to be hanged. John Proctor, Rebecca Nurse and Martha Corey recite the [[Lord's Prayer]]. Before they finish, they are pushed off the platform edges to their instant death.  
D3: The Mighty Ducks
   The Ducks are being awarded junior varsity hockey scholarships to Eden Hall Academy, a prestigious prep school that coach Gordon Bombay ([[Emilio Estevez]]) attended, following their victory at the Junior Goodwill Games in Los Angeles, California. Bombay announces that he will be leaving his position as coach to take a job with the Junior Goodwill Games, much to Charlie's dismay. Bombay's spot is filled by former [[Minnesota North Stars]] player Ted Orion ([[Jeffrey Nordling]]). Initially the Ducks clash with Orion's disciplinary coaching tactics and his focus on defense over scoring. Orion abandons several Duck traditions, including starting Julie Gaffney in goal over Greg Goldberg, based on Julie's superior play in tryouts, directing the team to play a defensive-minded system and strips Charlie Conway ([[Joshua Jackson]]) of his Captain's 'C', stating that the strategies the team used in the past won't work anymore. He is proven right when, in their first game, the Ducks take an embarrassing tie after losing a 9-goal lead, due to their cockiness after their initial dominance. Orion is livid, but makes a valid point (about hockey and life) when he states that the Ducks won't be able to dominate every game and have to learn how to play "two-way hockey," not choking when the game is going their way. Charlie's only consolation is meeting Linda (Margot Finley), a student petitioning to change the school's team name (The Warriors) as it [[Native American mascot controversy|perpetuates an offensive Native American stereotype]]. Though she initially writes him off as a mindless jock, the two start to hit it off.  The team's difficulties are further compounded by the attitude towards them on the part of most of the students and parents at Eden Hall, particularly the Varsity hockey team, which Adam Banks has been recruited into. The two teams engage in an escalating prank war, culminating in an unofficial match in the school's ice rink, in which the Ducks are badly beaten. When Coach Orion forbids the old Ducks name and uniforms, declaring "The Ducks are dead", Charlie finally becomes fed up with Orion, whom he considers washed-up, and leaves the team with Fulton Reed. Greg Goldberg is made a defenseman to replace Fulton. Venting to Hans, his and Gordon's mentor, Charlie becomes further upset after Hans appears to take Orion's side. After skipping school at the Mall of America and Charlie proposing going to public schools before pursuing hockey careers, Fulton realizes he might not want to follow Charlie or play hockey for the rest of his life. He also tries to suggest Charlie rejoin the Ducks. Chagrined at that suggestion and Fulton's abandonment, Charlie is still struggling with what to do when he learns that Hans, the Ducks' friend and mentor, has passed away.   Bombay returns for Hans' memorial and the next day takes Charlie back to Eden Hall. He explains to Charlie, that Orion was actually a great pro player who only left the sport because he wanted to care for his daughter, a paraplegic as a result of a car accident he was in. Bombay explains that he told Orion that Charlie was the heart and soul of the team, and it was his hope that both Orion and Charlie would learn something from each other. Touched by this, Charlie agrees to rejoin the team.  Arriving at the team bus for the next game, Charlie apologizes to Orion who, surprised by Charlie's sincerity, welcomes him back. Fulton also rejoins the team before Charlie does, apparently no longer disillusioned about hockey. Prior to the bus' departure, Dean Buckley ([[David Selby]]), the school's headmaster, informs the team that its board of trustees is going to vote to revoke the Ducks' scholarships, due to the unpopularity of the decision to admit them, and their mediocre performance on the ice. The Dean offers Orion a chance to start anew with a team of his choice, but Orion refuses, going so far as to threaten resignation, and assures his team that he's going to fight the decision.  At the Board of Trustees meeting, the Ducks state their case, but no one is willing to listen until Bombay arrives and threatens the group with an injunction, promising to tie up the matter in court until long after the kids have gone on to college. The board reluctantly votes to reinstate the Ducks' scholarships. When the Varsity team learns the Ducks are staying and continue their harassment, the Ducks and the Warriors agree that if Varsity beats JV in the upcoming exhibition game, JV will leave the school, but if JV wins, the official team name will be changed to the Mighty Ducks. Orion and the Ducks train hard, focusing specifically on defense around the goal. Orion returns the Ducks' jerseys right before the game, feeling that the team has finally earned them.  Throughout the game, the Varsity dominates on offense, but the Ducks' newly acquired defensive skills manage to keep the game scoreless after two periods. Unable to score, the Varsity instead start to viciously check every player they can, so that the Ducks are battered going into the third period. During the second intermission, Dean Portman ([[Aaron Lohr]]), who had initially refused the school's scholarship, returns to the team, adding a needed spark. Late in the game, the Ducks get two penalties and must play 5 vs 3. During the time-out, Orion renames Charlie captain and tells him to go for the win if the opportunity presents itself.  With seconds left in the game, Charlie is on a breakaway, but in a surprise move passes the puck back to Goldberg, who scores into a wide-open net as time expires, securing a 1–0 victory for the Ducks.  Following the victory, Charlie embraces Orion and spots Bombay who has attended the game. They both look across to the Warriors emblem, which is suddenly replaced by an unrolling banner with the Ducks' logo, officially changing the team name to the Eden Hall Mighty Ducks. Varsity exits the ice humiliated. Upon seeing this, Linda kisses Charlie. Bombay then departs the rink with a smile, knowing his protege has matured.

On an apparent everyday evening a sign pointing to a nearby agritourism fell and a bus with a group of [[flamenco]] dancers due to town for a recital, get lost. They can't find their way to the agritourism and their lazy manager had forgot to confirm reservations so their rooms aren't available anymore anyway.  They have no chance but to stop at the ''Quarini'' residence to spend the night, and the story unfolds from here....

Immediately after, the mine is attacked by a team of mercenaries, led by a rogue agent called Chang. Scott attempts to flee, but is supposedly killed by Chang. The mercenaries leave right as the army arrives. The government assumes Morgan is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of villagers, apparently caused by toxic waste. Due to the CIA, Morgan is allowed to return to America.  One year later, Morgan is approached by Maurice Dupont for a mission to clear his name and prevent further deaths. Morgan reluctantly agrees upon finding out that Scott is alive. Morgan is introduced to [[World Health Organization]] researcher Dr. Kim Woods. The two are teamed up. After searching a mine, Morgan and Kim are captured by rebel forces. Morgan and Kim are almost executed until Scott reveals himself to be their secret leader. Not long after, Chang's mercenaries attack and lay waste to the camp. Scott gives Morgan a code and the last clue he needs to find the barrels. Chang then murders Scott as Morgan and Kim escape.

Daddy's Girl (film)
 Eleven-year-old girl, Jody, is adopted by a loving couple, Don, and Barbara Mitchell. Jody develops an obsession with her father and paranoia and jealousy about others spending time with him. This leads her to become [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]] and so envious of his relationships with other people she sets out to remove these people from her father's life.  Jody kills her principal, Mrs. Hemp, when the latter suggests that Jody may need to be placed in a state-run boarding school, where she will only see her father on weekends, because of her behavior problems the past school year. Jody goes to the school when only Mrs. Hemp is there and tricks her into standing on a chair to retrieve a book from a high shelf. Jody then pushes the chair out from under her principal, and proceeds to tip the bookcase over onto her prostrate form.  Don and Barbara's marriage is becoming strained because of Don's constant spoiling of Jody and the fact that Barbara has to be the breadwinner since Don is working as a toy designer but his projects are not selling. Barbara vents her frustrations to various people, who tell her to divorce Don and take custody of Jody. Jody's maternal grandmother, Jacqueline, is one of the first to do so and, in response to this, Jody pours drain cleaning fluid into Jacqueline's juice one day when Jacqueline is at their house for brunch. She tries to trick Jacqueline into drinking by toasting her father as a great toy designer, but Jacqueline refuses to drink to this. So, later, Jody goes to her house and suggests playing a game of [[hide-and-seek]] with her so they can grow closer. Tricking Jacqueline into going upstairs and playing a cassette of her crying for help, Jody shoves her grandmother down the stairs.  Jacqueline survives the fall, but goes into a coma. She is later killed in the hospital when Jody sabotages her ventilator after waking up from her coma. Later, Jody kills her mother's friend, Rachel, as Jody had overheard Rachel advising Barbara to consider divorcing Don.  During the course of the film, Jody's adoptive cousin, Karen, a college student who has been staying with the family for the summer, becomes suspicious of Jody's behavior. She begins investigating Jody's past, despite Barbara's insistence that she mind her own business, and discovers that as a toddler, Jody witnessed the murder of her biological father by her biological mother, and that she had been removed from her previous foster home when her foster father was convicted of fraud after his wife was killed by being a nag, suspiciously similar to that of Jody's recently deceased adoptive grandmother. This causes Karen to alert social services.  At the end of the film, Jody pushes Barbara over the edge of a [[balcony]] upon discovering that she is on the verge of finding out about Jody's crimes, but this does not kill her. When the social worker arrives at Jody's home, Jody bludgeons him with a heavy meat tenderizing mallet, then tries to pin it on Karen. Don, who was at a toy convention, returns home to tell Barbara that she no longer has to be breadwinner as he successfully sold a design for a lot of money, only to find the body of the social worker and his wife injured on the ground. Karen calls 911 and Barbara tells Don everything.  Jody begins crying, saying that everyone is against her and begs Don to comfort her. Don, now knowing what his adopted daughter really is and disgusted by her actions, refuses to comfort her. The movie closes with Jody's crying and the sound of police sirens in the background, giving implication to Jody's potential fate.

Daylight (1996 film)
 In upstate New York, a waste management firm loads barrels of toxic waste onto trucks, intending to illegally dispose of them at a site in New Jersey. They are shown heading into the [[Holland Tunnel]] along with several other commuters, including struggling playwright Maddy Thompson ([[Amy Brenneman]]), a bus of juvenile offenders, a vacationing family, an elderly couple, and mountain climbing equipment retailer Roy Nord ([[Viggo Mortensen]]). Meanwhile, a gang of diamond thieves in a stolen car try to escape the [[NYPD]] by racing into the tunnel. The gang force their way through the north tube traffic, where the driver loses control, smashing though a security booth and into one of the trucks, causing it to detonate, and resulting in a [[sympathetic detonation]] of the remaining trucks. The tunnel entrances cave in, and a devastating fireball sweeps through the tunnel, incinerating the majority of the motorists within it.  About to enter the Manhattan end of the tunnel, former New York City Emergency Medical Services Chief Kit Latura ([[Sylvester Stallone]]), now working as a cab driver, witnesses the fireball erupting from the entrance. While racing to help whoever he can he runs into an old EMS colleague, who tells him that the tunnel is severely damaged, and could come down if any wrong moves are made. Kit then checks with tunnel administrators, and finds that most of the old exits have been sealed off or are considered unsafe. Kit makes his way into the tunnel through the ventilation system, risking his life as the massive fans can only be slowed down for a short time.  A group of the survivors trapped inside band around Nord, who believes he can find a way out through the mid-river passage, a service corridor running between the north and south tubes. Kit arrives and finds Nord, warning him that the passage could come down at any moment, but Nord dismisses the possibility. Kit barely escapes as the mid-river collapses, killing Nord, and causing another explosion which kills a survivor.  Water begins seeping in from the river above, and Kit uses an explosive to stop the leak. Police officer George Tyrell ([[Stan Shaw]]) returns from investigating the Manhattan end and is crushed under a truck as the road shifts. The group manage to free him before he can drown, but he is left with a broken neck. The water level continues to rise and the angry survivors confront Kit. He claims he can slow it down but not stop it, as the clean-up effort on the Manhattan side of the tunnel is causing water to enter their side. Kit recalls that there are sleeping quarters beside the tunnels (left over from the tunnel’s construction) and asks George how to access them. Kit finds one by swimming under a security booth, and leads the group to this area, but George has to be left behind. He gives Kit a bracelet intended for his girlfriend Grace ([[Vanessa Bell Calloway]]), and tells him to "get them to daylight".  Eleanor ([[Claire Bloom]]), one of the elder survivors, is distressed that her late son's dog Cooper is missing. She refuses to go on, then suddenly yet quietly passes away, presumably from [[hypothermia]]. The group moves to another room as the first one floods, convincing Eleanor's husband Roger ([[Colin Fox (actor)|Colin Fox]]) to come with them. As they reach the top of an old wooden staircase, Kit notices Cooper swimming in the water below and dives down to rescue him, passing him up to one of the survivors, but a beam falls and destroys the lower half, sending Kit into the water. Maddy tries to help Kit up, but she falls as well, as more of the staircase is knocked down. The main group escape through a manhole into daylight while the corridor caves in behind them, but not before one of the survivors takes a flashlight from his daughter and tosses it to Kit, leaving Kit and the hysterical Maddy behind.  Kit and Maddy swim around looking for a possible way out, with the main highway tunnel now almost completely submerged. Kit realizes he will have to use his explosives to cause a "blow out" and rip the tunnel roof open. The blast forces Maddy towards the surface, but throws Kit downwards. Maddy finds a barely conscious Kit and keeps him afloat, as a boat discovers them offshore. Lying on a [[stretcher]], Kit sees Grace in the crowd and hands her George's bracelet. Maddy insists on riding with him in the ambulance, to which Kit replies "on one condition; we gotta take the bridge."

Durant]]. Thorne claims that she wants to help Westlake discover the key to his liquid skin, and also repair his nervous system, allowing him to regain some of his sensory loss. Using a laboratory set-up Thorne has, Westlake is finally able to devise a small amount of permanent liquid skin, which does not break down in sunlight as his other samples have.  However, Thorne is revealed to be the mistress of corrupt businessman Peter Rooker ([[Jeff Fahey]]). Rooker desires the super-human strength that Westlake has at his disposal. Rooker and Thorne plan to use Westlake as a [[human subject research|guinea pig]] to unlock the secrets behind his strength. Westlake is captured and his liquid skin sample and research are taken.

Westlake is able to stop the assassination attempt. After, Rooker murders Thorne, and kidnaps his wife and daughter. He takes them back to Thorne's laboratory and holds them hostage, injecting himself with the same formula he used to give his thugs super-human strength. Westlake arrives, and after a confrontation with Rooker, is able to kill him by tricking him into falling into an industrial crushing device. He reclaims the sample of permanent liquid skin during the fight, but his research discs are destroyed by Rooker. The laboratory explodes when a natural gas line ruptures.

Dead Man's Walk (miniseries)
  ===Part 1=== The series begins in the [[Republic of Texas]] in 1842, as [[Comanche]] warriors led by [[Buffalo Hump]] use the full moon to conduct [[Comanche–Mexico Wars|slave-raids on settlements in northern Mexico]]. Woodrow Call and Augustus "Gus" McCrae are junior [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] of a larger party heading west to scout a road from [[San Antonio]] to [[El Paso]]. Tasked with night watching the camp, a drunk McCrae wanders off exploring and is chased and wounded by Buffalo Hump. The next morning, the group is ambushed and two of the party are killed and one wounded.  Three months later in [[Austin]], another larger group is being assembled in order to seize [[Santa Fe, New Mexico#United States|Santa Fe]] from the Mexicans as the [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition]]. McCrae encounters Clara Forsythe at the local store and Call meets Maggie at the local whorehouse. News of a Comanche raid takes the Rangers group west over the [[Brazos River]], where they are ambushed while resting. Call manages the only kill of the punishment squad's raid, whereas McCrae proposes to Clara. Rejoining the expedition, they encounter Buffalo Hump again and learn (after inviting him to parley at their camp) that it was his son who died at the hands of Call.  The expedition begins to break up as it is slowed by heavy rains and many of the civilians opt to return to Austin. The increasingly rocky terrain of [[Comancheria]] also proves troublesome for the wagons. They again encounter the natives who harry them by stealing their horses and setting fire to the grasslands. Now on foot, with no horses and limited supplies, the party splits again over gathering food and which way to travel to find water. McCrae, weakened by hunger and thirst, is haunted by a dream of Buffalo Hump riding a buffalo.  ===Part 2=== Wallace, Call, and McCrae are arrested by Mexican militia after stumbling into a remote Mexican village. En route to San Lazaro, the camp is attacked at night by a grizzly, allowing them to escape with rifles. In the darkness they re-find their companions, and the morning reveals a large Mexican army camp nearby. Now numbering about 30, weakened by hunger, and with limited ammunition, Colonel Cobb enters the camp and surrenders to the Mexicans - but not without resistance from Call who attacks Cobb and receives 100 lashes as punishment.  The army breaks camp and moves with their prisoners through [[Apache]] lands, where they soon find the corpses of their general and his retinue - including Cobb who survived blinded and crippled. Many of the group are unfit for the "dead man's walk" through the wastelands and across "the big dry", more so after Cobb decides to die in a blaze of glory, injuring some of his own soldiers in the process. As they travel, the nights become increasingly cold, increasing the suffering of the travellers. Finally they begin the desert crossing, but their horses are soon stolen by this region's rogue natives, led by an Apache named Gomez. Their numbers dwindle as they are picked off one by one, until they finally reach the [[Rio Grande]] having survived the [[Jornada del Muerto]].  Here the prisoners are transferred to a French Major in charge of a troop of lancers, and the disgraced Mexican Captain is told to return across the desert to his post despite the dangers. They soon arrive at San Lazaro, a leper colony, and the seven surviving men are forced to select lots to decide who among them will be executed for treason. Also in the colony is an English prisoner, who asks to travel back to Austin with them and offers to provision the journey. One the way back they again travel back through [[Comancheria]] but are able to spook the Comanche with an aria, a snake, and a sword. Back in Austin, McCrae calls again on Clara, and the two kiss while Call looks on awkwardly.

The Delicate Art of the Rifle
 The movie takes the [[Point of view (literature)|point-of-view]] of Jay (David Grant), a college student whose main interests are theater and computer games. While Jay moves around his school's well-equipped theater building he delivers a long voice-over soliloquy revealing his quirky personality. Jay has difficulty interpreting other people: he mentions that his classmates often try to trick him into believing absurd statements, and he cannot always tell whether girls are just being polite to him or if they especially like him. Jay's voice-over is intercut with scenes of the production that is being performed in the theater, a fashion show version of ''Hamlet''.  Jay leaves the theater and encounters one of his professors, Dr. Max Boaz (John Kessel). As Jay and Max are walking outdoors a sniper opens fire from a rooftop and kills all the people around Jay. His roommate Walt (Stephen Grant) yells from the rooftop, asking Jay to come up and join him. Jay assumes Walt must be up there trying to assist wounded people or stop the sniper. Eager to help, Jay enters the building and tries to get to the roof, experiencing several bizarre encounters with other people along the way.  After Jay arrives on the roof he learns that Walt is actually the sniper. Between outbursts of shooting, Walt says he comes from a long line of sharpshooters and has been working on a book about his family entitled ''The Delicate Art of the Rifle.''  Walt also tells Jay about incidents in which Walt tried to locate his girlfriend. She had disappeared and her friends and relatives did not remember her. Walt has come to the conclusion that there is some sort of "metaphysical virus" that erases people from history, removing all traces of them. Walt believes that he also has the virus and will soon disappear.  The movie ends with a long [[steadicam]] scene that follows Jay as he walks through the theater building closing doors and turning off lights. In his voice-over monologue Jay reveals that Walt vanished and was never found. Jay says he has lost all his newspaper clippings of the sniper incident. At the very end Jay's voice-over intimates that Walt "erasing virus" theory might have been correct, but with Jay as a classic [[unreliable narrator]] this is never definitively established.  
Deadly Outbreak
  Sergeant Dutton Hatfield is working for the American embassy. His latest assignment is to escort a supposed team of scientists inside the Research Development Institute facility outside [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]. However, the scientists are revealed to be terrorists in disguise, led by Colonel Baron. Baron is seeking retribution for his humiliation when he had an ideological disagreement with his superior officer General Miller, over the merits of the [[Gulf War]], and Miller forced him to retire after Miller became Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. Baron and his eight men, including an insider scientist named Dr. Berg, are seeking a sample of a deadly virus that is being developed inside the facility, and plan to use both the virus and a set of five pre-arranged bombs in [[Washington, D.C.]] as leverage to arrange an escape and a payment of $510 million.  Once the takeover of the facility begins, Hatfield quickly discovers the plot and eliminates three terrorists, while the remaining five take the only four surviving scientists - Pawklowsky (Andre Kashkar), Elaine Starkov (Bridget Marks), Eliot Stein (Larry Smith), and Abrahams (Ami Dayan) - as hostages. Hatfield then meets Dr. Allie Levin, the scientist behind the development of the virus for biological warfare, and with the help of a communications officer named Ira, tries to have her escorted out through the evacuation tunnels in the basement. However, they encounter two more terrorists in the basement; Hatfield manages to kill both, but not before one of them guns down Ira, after he acts as a human shield to defend Dr. Levin. After Ira's death, Hatfield and Levin bond over their respective separations with their spouses; Levin's husband, a pilot in the [[United States Air Force]], was killed in the Gulf War, while Hatfield's wife left him for his former best friend. Hatfield and Levin quickly become attracted to each other.  Baron then orders his ruthless right-hand man Ramos to begin executing the hostages, starting with Dr. Abrahams. In order to avoid more dead hostages, Hatfield agrees to a swap with Ramos to exchange the cylinder containing the virus with the second hostage, Dr. Stein. However, once Ramos retrieves the cylinder, he kills Stein and flees. Unbeknownst to Hatfield, another remaining terrorist named Gallo has taken Dr. Levin and brought her back to be with the other hostages. Baron orders Dr. Berg to prepare a sample of the toxin as a demonstration, only to betray Berg and demonstrate its lethal effects on him; after smashing the vial containing the sample and ripping off Berg's gas mask, the toxin kills him within seconds, thus satisfying Baron.  Baron and Ramos take Levin, Pawklowsky, and Starkov aboard a bus after both General Miller and Israeli Colonel Gideon have negotiated a cleared roadway to the airport, with $500 million being wired to Baron's designated account and the remaining $10 million loaded onto the waiting plane, piloted by one final terrorist. Gallo pursues Hatfield in security vans down the numerous evacuation tunnels, culminating in both of them crashing in the facility's loading dock, with Gallo's van exploding and killing him. Colonel Gideon arrives in a helicopter just in time to pick up Hatfield, and the two pursue the bus. Ramos kills both Starkov and Pawklowsky to try to convince the soldiers to back off, but Hatfield leaps onto the roof of the bus anyway and drops in through the roof hatch. After a brief fight with Ramos, Hatfield gains the upper hand and puts him in a chokehold just as the bus arrives at the airport. Hatfield tries to force Baron to stop the bus by threatening to kill Ramos, only for Baron to shoot Ramos himself. Hatfield then attacks Baron and knocks him unconscious at the wheel, and Hatfield and Levin both jump out with the cylinder just before the bus crashes into a parked fuel truck, exploding and killing Baron. Hatfield then notices the final surviving terrorist at the getaway plane, who has taken Hatfield's son hostage. The terrorist shoots Hatfield in the shoulder, only for Gideon to snipe him from the chopper. The wounded Hatfield reunites with both his son and Levin.

After they finish, Alan retrieves his pistol and follows Matt in his car.  He is led to Paula Roberts's house, a friend of Brooke's. Alan invents a story about a surprise party for Brooke and watches Paula invite Matt inside.  Paula's dog attacks Alan, and he shoots it in self-defense.  After returning to his car, he drives to work.  At his dental practice, Alan's first appointment goes poorly when he hallucinates a child has rotten teeth and accidentally stabs him.  As Detective Gibbs investigates the death of Paula's dog, Alan sees his second patient, April Reign, a beauty queen.  Alan hallucinates she is his wife, and, while she is unconscious, takes off her pantyhose and fondles her before choking her.  As she wakes, Alan snaps out of it and hides her pantyhose.  Alan tells his manager, Steve Landers, she is still dizzy from [[nitrous oxide]].  When Steve realizes what really happened, he returns, punches Alan, and threatens a lawsuit.  Alan ends the day early and sends his staff and patients home, including Sarah, a teenager who wants to have her braces removed.  Later that night, Brooke meets Alan at a new opera-themed room at his practice.  After sedating her under the premise of cleaning her teeth, he pulls out her teeth and cuts off her tongue.  Detective Gibbs and his partner Detective Sunshine arrive at Alan's house the next morning to ask him questions.  After the policemen leave, Matt discovers Brooke, who is still alive but sedated.  Alan stabs Matt to death.  Sarah and Paula are waiting for Alan at his practice.  Alan sees Paula first, much to Sarah's disappointment.  When Paula's conversation turns to how good a job Matt does for her, Alan overly-aggressively drills into her tooth, destroying it.  His assistant, Jessica, questions what he is doing, and he snaps out of it.  Alan asks Jessica to finish for him, but after he discovers she has sent Paula home, he fires Jessica.  When she pulls out April's pantyhose and threatens to expose him, Alan kills her.  At the police station, Detective Sunshine discovers that the bullet pulled from Paula's dog's only matches one gun in the area: Alan's. [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] agent Marvin Goldblum, using Alan's tax problems as leverage, extorts a free dental exam and a payout.  Instead, Alan tortures him. Detective Sunshine and Detective Gibbs drive to the Feinstone house to question him further.  Near the pool, they discover Matt's body. They quickly break into the house and find the mutilated Brooke, tied to the bed but still alive. Later, Alan's other dental assistant, Karen, finds Marvin still in the dental chair.  Alan attacks her, then kills her by injecting a needle full of air into her jugular vein.  After Alan removes Sarah's braces, he imagines her teeth rotting.  He pulls his gun, but she escapes and hides in one of the dental rooms, where she finds the blood-soaked Marvin, who attacks Alan.  When Alan recaptures her,  Sarah hysterically promises to brush her teeth three times a day and to never eat candy.  Satisfied, Alan leaves.  The two detectives arrive and rescue Sarah, but are too late to capture Alan.  They follow Alan to a university, where he teaches dentistry classes.  There, Alan maniacally instructs all of his students to pull all of the teeth out of all their patients.  As he hallucinates and shoots a dental student that he mistakes for Matt, the detectives burst into the room, but Alan uses a hostage to escape.  Eventually, he wanders into an auditorium where an opera singer is practicing.  Enchanted, he watches her from behind.  When he reaches out to touch her, she transforms into Brooke, who laughs at him.  Defeated, he falls to his knees and is arrested by the detectives.  Alan, now in a psychiatric hospital, is carted off to his regular dental appointment.  The dentist working on him is revealed to be his toothless wife Brooke, who works violently on his mouth.

After reading about the discovery of a [[John Doe]] in a nearby river, Mia goes to view the body at the sheriff's station, but finds it is not Guy. There, she attracts the attention of Shirley Vogel, a retired police officer-turned-[[private investigator]] who offers to look into Guy's disappearance. Nicole is resistant, and Shirley quickly becomes suspicious of the women. Their fears of a blackmailer are confirmed when Mia discovers the shower curtain used to conceal Guy's body hanging in her bathroom window.  Shirley confronts Mia with the accident report from Guy's car, and surmises that Guy was en route to see her in Pittsburgh on the day he disappeared. Mia grows increasingly paranoid, believing Guy is alive and stalking the women. This fear increases when two videographers filming an event at the school capture an image of Guy standing in one of the building's windows. Later, while investigating the school's basement, Shirley is attacked and knocked unconscious.  That night, Mia finds Guy floating in her bathtub, and witnesses him rise from the water. Terrified, she loses consciousness and collapses, apparently suffering a [[heart attack]]. Nicole arrives, and it is revealed that she and Guy had planned the series of events to scare Mia to the point of heart failure. Nicole laments, however, and tells Guy she had wanted to call it off. While overlooking Mia's body, Nicole realizes she is in fact not dead; when Guy realizes she is alive, he attacks both women, knocking Nicole unconscious.  Mia flees downstairs, and Guy tackles her to the ground in front of the pool and attempts to drown her. Nicole manages to stop him by driving a garden rake into his head, and he falls into the pool. As Nicole attempts to revive Mia, Guy pulls her into the pool and tries to drown her. Mia enters the pool, and together, both women successfully drown him. They exit the pool and are confronted by Shirley, who punches Mia in the face; willing to cover for the women, she explains it will help prove [[self-defense]] in Guy's murder. Mia walks away from the pool, distraught, and Shirley smokes a cigarette while watching Guy's body sink to the bottom.

But Shaka has already reached there and is waiting for him in the captain's office. He kills Raja Saab, but Dara and his men escape. When a couple of Dara's men try to kill Radhika, Shabnam kills them and rescues her. Shabnam brings Radhika to Shaka, but they are all confronted by the Major. He tells Shaka that he knows the truth and is sorry, but will still have to arrest him. Shaka agrees, but wants to stop Dara and his men from crossing the border since he believes that they still have good in their hearts. The Major agrees and they go in a [[snowmobile]] towards the border and reach there before Dara and his men. They see Pakistani soldiers laying mines, but are captured by them.  The Pakistani Major tells them they want to kill Dara and his men since they can always create more terrorists. Shaka and the Major kill them all and go towards the border. When Shaka goes to stop Dara and his men, the Major stops him saying that he wants to kill terrorists. Shaka says that he wants to kill terrorism.

Down Periscope
 Lt. Commander Thomas Dodge ([[Kelsey Grammer]]) is about to be passed over a third time for his own nuclear submarine. The reasons given are (1) his unorthodox command methods, (2) an unfortunate "brushing" incident with a Russian submarine, and (3) the rumor of a genital tattoo he acquired after getting blind drunk following that incident. Failure to secure a submarine will result in Dodge being dropped from the navy's command program.  During his career, Dodge has made an enemy of Rear Admiral Yancy Graham ([[Bruce Dern]]), who strongly speaks out against Dodge's promotion. Vice-Admiral Dean Winslow, [[ComSubLant]] ([[Rip Torn]]) likes Dodge and his unorthodox methods. A war game is planned to test the navy's defenses against attack from older Soviet [[diesel engine|diesel]]-powered submarines in the hands of America's enemies. Among the defenses being tested is the Navy's latest submarine and Dodge's prior [[billet]] USS ''Orlando'', headed by his former CO Commander Carl Knox ([[William H. Macy]]). Dodge is selected to put the World War II-era [[Balao class submarine|''Balao''-class]] diesel sub USS ''Stingray'' (SS-161) back in commission as the war game's Opposing Force. Winslow tells him to "throw out the book" and "think like a pirate", promising Dodge that if he can sink a target ship in [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk]] Harbor, Dodge will be considered for a command.  Graham handpicks a "crew from hell" for ''Stingray'': hot-tempered, uptight Lt. Martin Pascal ([[Rob Schneider]]) as the Executive Officer; crusty civilian naval contractor Howard ([[Harry Dean Stanton]]) as Chief Engineer; rebellious Engineman 1st Class Brad Stepanek ([[Bradford Tatum]]); sharp-eared Sonarman 2nd Class E.T. "Sonar" Lovacelli ([[Harland Williams]]); compulsive gambler Seaman Stanley "Spots" Sylvesterson ([[Jonathan Penner]]); former college basketball player Seaman Jefferson "R.J." Jackson ([[Duane Martin]]); shock-addled Electrician's Mate Nitro ([[Toby Huss]]); and not-so-Culinary Specialist Second Class Buckman ([[Ken Hudson Campbell]]) as Stingray's cook. Knowing the sub is unsuited for mixed-gender living, Graham also selects Lt. Emily Lake ([[Lauren Holly]]) to serve as the sub's Diving Officer, the only woman aboard.  Using unorthodox tactics and an Atlantic storm, Dodge and his crew sneak into [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] Harbor and set off signal flares. Now desperate to defeat Dodge, Graham reduces the war game containment area by half without Winslow's authorization. Failing to penetrate Norfolk Harbor, Dodge leaves the containment area and heads out to sea. Irate at this lapse in protocol, the strident, by-the-book Pascal attempts to take command of the ''Stingray''; the crew does not support his action, so Dodge charges Pascal with [[mutiny]]. Wearing mock-buccaneer outfits and talking like pirates, Dodge and crew force the blindfolded XO to [[Walking the plank|walk the plank]] into the raised fishing net of a waiting trawler that will take him ashore.  During ''Stingray''s second attempt at Norfolk, Graham assumes personal control of the ''Orlando''. Dodge employs an incredibly dangerous maneuver to sneak past the ships and aircraft protecting Norfolk. ''Orlando'' is able to locate and chase her down. Before the ''Orlando''s shooting solution is obtained, Dodge is able to fire two live torpedoes at 900 yards into the anchored target ship at Norfolk, winning the war game for ''Stingray''.  Returning to port, Graham is chastised by Admiral Winslow and denied his promotion. After confiding that Engineman Stepanek is actually his son, using his mother's name, Winslow informs Dodge that he will not get a ''Los Angeles''-class submarine, as previously discussed, but a new [[Seawolf class submarine|''Seawolf''-class]] submarine (the US Navy's most advanced attack submarines), plus a proper crew. Dodge respectfully requests that his entire ''Stingray'' crew be transferred with him. He then dismisses his crew to begin a well-earned shore leave. As Dodge and Lake leave the dock, she poses a query now that they know each other: "What exactly is this 'tattoo' I keep hearing about?".

Helms, however, succeeds in escaping the crazed man, but receives a minor cut on his hand.  A few days later, in [[Frankfurt]], Captain James Holland ([[Richard Dean Anderson]]), amidst preparations for his forthcoming [[transatlantic flight]] as Captain of Quantum Airlines Flight 66, is told by his doctor he does not have cancer. On board Flight 66, a [[Boeing 747]], Helms (already displaying signs of illness) is assisted to his seat by flight attendant Brenda Hopkins ([[Kate Hodge]]). Shortly after takeoff, Helms rises from his seat and falls into [[cardiac arrest]], and Brenda gives him [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]]. Head flight attendant Barb Rollins (Jennifer Savidge) notifies Holland of the emergency, and the Captain and his [[check pilot]], Daniel Robb ([[Richard Lawson (actor)|Richard Lawson]]) set a course for [[London]]'s [[Heathrow Airport]],.  However they are turned away when British [[Air traffic control|Air-Traffic Control]] informs them that one of the passengers (Helms) could be infected with a deadly strain of [[influenza]].  Several harrowing events follow. The [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] ([[Edward Herrmann]]) unsuccessfully tries to sneak Flight 66 into [[RAF Mildenhall]], disguised as a [[United States Air Force]] fighter plane and guided in by another, despite a recommendation otherwise by Ambassador Lee Lancaster ([[Robert Guillaume]]), but the British forces at the base jam the runway with emergency vehicles.   Holland threatens to land anyway, only to pull up at the last minute, showing the U.S. Government how desperate the situation is.  Soon thereafter,  an investigation is set in motion by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. Flight 66 lands at the [[Naval Air Station Keflavik|U.S. air base in Iceland]], but one passenger is so distraught at being separated from her child and at being in [[quarantine]] that she runs down the airplane stairs and is shot and killed by U.S. troops in [[MOPP]] gear.  Holland flies the aircraft toward [[Mauritania]], but a female intelligence agent warns Holland that an assassin is trying to destroy the flight.  Holland tricks the assassin (in a missile-armed [[Learjet|Lear jet]]) into crashing and lands on [[Ascension Island]].

The movie indicates that the flight attendant who gave Helms CPR died six months after the incident, presumably from the virus.

The two starring actresses, Hitomi Kurokawa and Saori Murakami, play sisters in his film. Murai has a crush on Hitomi (Shiroshima), the seasoned leading actress, and keeps a photo of her by his bed.

The production of the movie is consistently interrupted by strange occurrences and the cast and crew begin to get spooked. When Murai reviews the shoot, he is shocked to see that scenes from an unreleased (and presumed destroyed) drama from years earlier are intermingled with his negatives. As Murai is watching his footage, the scene is interrupted by a film within a film of an unidentified actress on a movie set, with something that looks like a woman behind her, long black hair, pale skin, out of focus, laughing hysterically. Murai is fascinated with the freaky footage, as it looks strangely familiar. The production shuts down for a formal investigation. Murai has only three days left to find out what is going on and finish the shoot.

Dragonheart
 An English knight of [[chivalry|'The Old Code']], Bowen, mentors a [[Saxons|Saxon]] prince, Einon, in his ideals with the hope that he will be a better king than his tyrannical father Freyne. While suppressing a peasant rebellion, the king is killed and Kara, a young peasant girl, accidentally causes Einon to be mortally wounded. Einon's mother, Queen Aislinn, has him taken before a [[dragon]] and asks it to save the boy's life. The dragon replaces Einon's wounded heart with half of its own on the promise that Einon will rule with justice and virtue. However, Einon proves even more tyrannical than his father by enslaving the former rebels and forcing them to rebuild a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] castle. Bowen, believing the dragon's heart twisted Einon, swears vengeance on all dragons.  Twelve years later, an adult Einon's castle is rebuilt. Kara asks that her father be freed after years of slavery; Einon agrees, but instead kills him to "free" him. Meanwhile, Bowen has become a very skilled dragonslayer. Brother Gilbert, a [[monk]] and aspiring [[poet]], observes Bowen's prowess and follows him to record his exploits. Bowen stalks a dragon to its cave, but the confrontation ends in a [[stalemate]]. The dragon states that he is the last of his kind and they agree not to kill each other, instead forming a partnership to defraud local villagers with staged dragonslayings. Bowen names the dragon Draco, after [[Draco (constellation)|the constellation]]. Unknown to Bowen, Draco is the dragon who shared his heart with Einon and feels any pain Einon feels.  Kara, seeking revenge on Einon, is imprisoned after a failed assassination attempt. Realizing she is responsible for his near-death as a boy, Einon attempts to seduce her and make her his queen. Aislinn, despising what her son has become, helps Kara escape. Kara tries to rally her village's people against Einon, but they instead offer her as a sacrifice to Draco. After she is taken to Draco's lair, Einon arrives to recapture her and fights Bowen. As they fight, Einon demoralizes Bowen by declaring that he never believed in the code and was only using Bowen to learn how to fight. He gains the upper hand and nearly kills Bowen; Draco intervenes and reveals his half-heart, causing Einon to flee. Kara asks Bowen to help overthrow Einon, but the disillusioned knight refuses.  Bowen and Draco come upon Gilbert at another village. Kara, disgusted by their actions, attempts to expose them while Draco is playing dead. When the villagers decide to carve him up for meat, he takes flight, revealing the [[confidence scam|scam]]. They then surround Bowen, Kara, and Gilbert, declaring to make ''them'' their meat instead. Draco rescues them and takes them to [[Avalon]], where they take shelter among the tombs of the [[Round Table|Knights of the Round Table]]. Draco tells Bowen about himself and Einon: he had hoped that by saving Einon, it would change his nature, reunite the races of Man and Dragon, and earn Draco a place in the stars, where worthy dragons go after they die. Instead, he fears his actions have cost him his [[soul]] and agrees to help fight against Einon. After a vision of [[King Arthur]] reminds him of his knightly honor, Bowen agrees as well.  Bowen and Draco organize the villagers into a formidable army, and they are nearly victorious against Einon's forces when Gilbert strikes Einon in the heart with an arrow. Draco, feeling Einon's pain, falls from the sky and is captured. Einon, realizing he is effectively immortal so long as Draco lives, is determined to keep the dragon safe. Aislinn, knowing of the connection, attempts to kill Draco during the night, but Einon intercepts and kills her instead.  The rebels invade Einon's castle, and Bowen throws Einon from the top of a tower. While trying to free Draco, he begs Bowen to kill him and end Einon's reign. Bowen can't bring himself to kill his friend, but Einon rises up and charges at Bowen. Reluctantly, Bowen throws an ax into Draco's exposed half-heart, killing Einon and Draco. Draco's body dissipates as his soul becomes a new star in the constellation, and Bowen and Kara lead the kingdom into an era of justice and brotherhood.

Eddie (film)
 The [[New York Knicks]] are also-rans in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], their roster filled with players who either lack talent or are too distracted by off-the-court issues. Nonetheless, limousine driver and rabid fan Edwina "Eddie" Franklin ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]) attends every Knicks game in the [[nosebleed section]] of [[Madison Square Garden]].  During halftime of a game, Eddie wins a contest to be honorary coach of the Knicks for the second half. She quickly gets on the nerves of head coach John Bailey ([[Dennis Farina]]), whom she had [[heckler|heckled]] earlier.  Eddie's popularity piques the interest of the new Knicks owner, "Wild Bill" Burgess ([[Frank Langella]]). After he forces Bailey to quit, Burgess names Eddie the new head coach.  At first, she is treated with skepticism and derision.  However, she understands that the Knicks have the talent to win, but the players' individual problems have caused the team to underperform.  [[Center (basketball)|Center]] Ivan Radmonovich, from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (sometimes referred to as a "Russian"), focuses only on scoring, and his lack of defensive technique leads him to frequently commit unnecessary [[blocking foul]]s.  Superstar forward Stacey Patton's me-first approach causes him to force low percentage shots because he is unwilling to pass, and his poor attitude hurts the team's morale - for example, he keeps referring to himself in the [[Illeism|third person]]. Rookie Jamal Duncan's occupation with being a rap star keeps him from focusing on his game, especially his free throws. Power Forward Terry Hastings' pending divorce from his wife due to an extramarital affair in Phoenix has a negative effect on his play on the court.  At a pivotal moment in practice, Eddie earns the team's respect by taking a hard foul from Patton in order to demonstrate proper defense to Ivan.  Eddie also begins to bench Patton in favor of veteran Nate Wilson, who was generally considered washed up because of chronic knee injuries.  Wilson experiences a late career resurgence, the Knicks begin to win, and New York City embraces the team and Eddie's colorful personality.  The team's winning streak eclipses their abysmal start, and as the season winds down, the Knicks are within reach of the playoffs.  In order to qualify, they will need to beat the [[Charlotte Hornets]], now coached by John Bailey, in the last game of the season.  The night before the game, Burgess tells Eddie that if the Knicks win, he will sell the team to a group that intends to relocate the team to [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] (this is a veiled reference to [[Georgia Frontiere]]'s similar move of the [[History of the Los Angeles Rams|Los Angeles Rams]] to St. Louis upon her assumption of the Rams ownership in 1995). A conflicted Eddie doesn't show to the game until right before tip-off.  During the game, Hornets forward [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] proves difficult to contain, but strong play from Wilson keeps the score close.  Bailey responds by telling Johnson to foul Wilson hard in the hopes of knocking him out of the game.  Johnson makes an unsuccessful attempt right before halftime: Wilson is hurt, but he is able to hit both foul shots and continue playing.  In the fourth quarter Johnson blows out Wilson's knee, forcing him out of the game.  Stacey Patton enters the game and shows a new team-first attitude, particularly on the Knicks' last offensive possession.  Eddie begins to diagram a play to get Patton the ball for a final shot, but assistant coach Carl Zimmer instead suggests that Bailey, remembering Patton's tendency to force low percentage shots, will swarm him with defenders.  The Knicks instead inbound to Patton, who passes to an open teammate after three defenders come to him.  The Knicks take a one-point lead with seconds left in the game.  Now, with the Knicks on the cusp of winning, Eddie realizes that a victory will cause the team to be relocated to St. Louis.  She decides to get on the Garden's PA system and reveal the entire plan to the world.  The fans react with shock and anger, and a frustrated Burgess is forced to promise the crowd he won't sell the team or move them out of New York City.  When play resumes, the Hornets have one last chance to win.  Bailey tells his team to get the ball to Johnson and have him drive the lane, expecting Ivan to commit a blocking foul.  Instead, Ivan remains set in his defensive position and Johnson is called for [[Personal foul (basketball)|charging]], which nullifies the basket, giving the Knicks the win and the playoff berth.  The film ends without explaining what happens to the Knicks in the playoffs that year.

As the elevator is about to close, a man shouts for them to let him in and Ellen manages to press the button in time to allow him into the elevator. The panic-stricken man, whose name is Hank, is a security guard in the building. He desperately uses his security card to override the controls and take the elevator back up. Ellen and Ben protest at what Hank is doing but are stunned to see Hank's shirt covered in blood.  Visibly shaken, Hank quickly explains that something outside (which he claims looks like an alien) is killing people and was about to get him. Ben disbelieves the guard's story and attempts to send the elevator back down but finds that he can't control it. Hank reveals he used the card and Ben angrily tries to grab it from him, but is repelled back when Hank takes out a spring-assisted knife to defend himself. Eventually, Ben restrains Hank while Ellen tries to call the lift telephone for help, to no avail. The elevator rocks and the lights go out, causing the three to stop. Ben reveals he has claustrophobia and uses Hank's knife to open the elevator panel and fiddle with the controls in order to operate the lift, but Hank stops him. Ben then tries to get the lift ceiling hatch open, but Hank stops him and tells him and Ellen that the monsters outside will get in and kill all of them. The lift becomes operational once again and Ellen manages to wrestle the card away from the men and use it to send the elevator down to the garage. Ben, desperate to be out of the lift, presses the button for floor 39.  As the trio watch, the elevator doors open but there is no sign of any monster/alien outside. Ben steps out and invites Ellen to join him in leaving the building via the stairs. Ellen initially accepts but becomes fearful of Ben when she sees Hank's knife in his pocket. She dashes right back into the elevator before Ben can stop her. While the lift goes down, Hank presses the stop button to halt the elevator and Ellen becomes panicked, saying that she wants to go down. Before they can argue, someone attempts to open the lift hatch. Hank keeps the hatch shut while instructing Ellen to send the elevator to floor 44. This causes the thing outside to stop its attempt to enter, but dents the hatch. Before the two can react, they're startled by Ben's mutilated corpse which comes tumbling down into the elevator.  Ellen blames Hank for not allowing Ben to enter as she believes he was trying to rescue her. Hank unsuccessfully tries to calm her and the two struggle to gain possession of the security card. They accidentally push the card out the elevator via the hole between the door and the floor. Ellen then uses the knife to open the panel like Ben did earlier. Hank tries again to convince her it's much safer to stay in the lift, but Ellen accidentally stabs the knife into him when she swings it in anger. Stunned by what she has done, she takes the knife out of Hank, but then proceeds to murder him by stabbing him repeatedly. The elevator once again operates and goes to the parking garage.  When the doors open, Ellen drops her knife and faces the garage. She hears voices ahead telling her to hold the elevator open for them, and soon a large group of people run toward her direction shouting and screaming, fleeing from something behind them, implying that what Hank first told Ellen and Ben was true and monsters were indeed attacking. The people squeeze past Ellen as she grins emptily, implying they will be Ellen's next victims instead.  
Emma (1996 theatrical film)
 The film describes a year in the life of [[Emma Woodhouse]] ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]), a congenial but naïve young woman who thinks of herself as a romantic matchmaker in her small community in early-19th-century England.  When her [[governess]], Miss Taylor ([[Greta Scacchi]]), gets married and goes to live with her new husband, Mr Weston ([[James Cosmo]]), Emma proudly takes the credit for having brought the couple together. Her father and their old family friend (and brother of Emma's sister's husband) [[George Knightley]] ([[Jeremy Northam]]) dispute her claim and disapprove of her trying to make more matches, but she ignores their warnings and sets her mind on setting up Mr Elton ([[Alan Cumming]]), the minister who performed the Westons' marriage ceremony, with Harriet Smith ([[Toni Collette]]), an unsophisticated young woman on the verges of society.  As a close friendship develops between Emma and Harriet, it becomes clear that Harriet is being courted by Robert Martin ([[Edward Woodall]]), a farmer who has known Harriet since she was a girl. When Mr Martin proposes to Harriet, she is inclined to accept, but she has come to rely heavily on Emma's advice, and Emma persuades her to reject the proposal. Meanwhile, Mr Elton has been expressing a desire for Emma by taking an interest in a picture she drew of Harriet and by giving her a riddle for a book of riddles being compiled by Harriet. Emma misinterprets this as interest in Harriet, but when Mr Elton and Emma are alone, he fervently declares his love for Emma herself, and she finally realizes her mistake. She harshly rejects his pleas, and he later marries another woman, who turns out to be a vain socialite who competes with Emma for status in the community.  Over the next few months, various gatherings show who loves whom among Emma's friends. Emma is briefly attracted to a charming, gallant young man named Frank Churchill ([[Ewan McGregor]]), Mr Weston's son who comes to visit from London, but Emma soon decides to set him up with Harriet. However, Frank is revealed to have a secret engagement with a shy, pretty woman named Jane Fairfax ([[Polly Walker]]). Harriet states that she has no interest in Frank, preferring Mr Knightley, who was the only man who would dance with her at a party. Mr Knightley only danced with Harriet out of politeness and has started to fall in love with Emma.  The conclusion of the story begins when Emma ridicules a poor woman named Miss Bates ([[Sophie Thompson]]) during a picnic, after which Mr Knightley angrily scolds Emma and leaves town for a while. She finds herself thinking about him while he's away, but does not realize she loves him until Harriet expresses interest in him. When Mr Knightley returns, he and Emma cross paths in a meadow and have a conversation that begins awkwardly but ends with him asking her to marry him and her gladly accepting. The news of their engagement upsets Harriet, who avoids Emma for a while, but returns a few weeks later, engaged to Mr Martin. The film ends with Emma and Mr Knightley's wedding.  
The Empty Mirror
 The film is a fantastical journey through the looking-glass of history into the darkest recesses of the mind of Adolf Hitler. In a dreamlike subterranean environment removed from historical time, [[Adolf Hitler]] ([[Norman Rodway]]) confronts the demons of his own psyche. As he dictates his memoirs, Hitler encounters apparitions of his confidant, [[Joseph Goebbels]] ([[Joel Grey]]), his enigmatic mistress, [[Eva Braun]] ([[Camilla Soeberg]]), [[Hermann Göring]] ([[Glenn Shadix]]), [[Sigmund Freud]] ([[Peter Michael Goetz]]) and the mysterious Woman in Black ([[Hope Allen]]).  Through haunting images, Hitler's stream-of-consciousness soliloquies and exchanges with his phantom guests, ''The Empty Mirror'' presents a frightening primer on genius and psychosis, domination and destruction. The action unfolds amidst a streaming flow of archival film footage intercut with images from [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s masterpiece of Nazi propaganda, ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'', as well as private home movies shot by Eva Braun.

The English Patient (film)
 In the final days of the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign of World War II]], Hana, a [[French-Canadian]] [[Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps|nurse]] of the [[Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps]], obtains permission from her unit to move into a bombed-out [[Italy|Italian]] [[monastery]], to look after a dying, critically burned man who speaks English but cannot remember his name. The patient's only possession is a copy of [[Histories (Herodotus)|Herodotus' Histories]] with notes, pictures and mementos contained inside. They are soon joined by Kip, a [[Sikh]] [[sapper]] in the [[British Army]] posted with his sergeant to clear mines and unexploded bombs in the local area, including one in the monastery where Hana and the English Patient are residing. David Caravaggio, a [[Canadian Intelligence Corps]] operative who has no thumbs as a result of torture during a German interrogation, also arrives to stay at the monastery. Caravaggio questions the patient, who gradually reveals his past to him, Hana and Kip through a series of flashbacks.  The patient tells Hana and Caravaggio that, in the late 1930s, he was exploring a region of the [[Sahara]] Desert near the Egyptian-Libyan border. He is revealed to be [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] [[Cartography|cartographer]] [[László Almásy|Count László de Almásy]], who was mapping the [[Sahara]] as part of a [[Royal Geographical Society]] [[Archaeology|archeological]] and [[surveying]] expedition in [[Egypt]] and Libya with a group including his good friend, Englishman Peter Madox. Their expedition is joined by a British couple, Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who own a new plane and are to contribute to the aerial survey efforts. Almásy is given clues by a local Bedouin man which help the group to discover the location of the [[Cave of Swimmers]], an ancient site of cave paintings in the [[Gilf Kebir]]. The group begin to document their find, during which time Almásy falls in love with Katharine. He writes about her in notes folded into his book, which Katharine discovers when Almásy awkwardly accepts her offer of two watercolours she has painted of the cave imagery, and asks her to paste them into the book. The two begin an affair on their return to Cairo, while the group arranges for more detailed archaeological surveys of the cave and the surrounding area. Almásy buys a silver thimble in the market as a gift to Katharine. Some months later, Katharine abruptly ends their affair from fear her husband Geoffrey will discover it. Shortly afterwards the archaeological projects are halted due to the onset of the war. Madox leaves his [[Boeing-Stearman Model 75|Boeing-Stearman]] aeroplane at [[Kufra|Kufra Oasis]] before his intended return to Britain.  Over the days while Almásy relates his story, Hana and Kip begin a shy love affair, but Kip is reposted once he has cleared the area of explosives. They agree they will meet again.  While Almásy is packing up the base camp at the cave site, Geoffrey, in an attempted [[murder-suicide]] having apparently long known about the affair between Almásy and Katharine, deliberately crashes his own [[De Havilland Tiger Moth|Tiger Moth]] plane, narrowly missing Almásy. Geoffrey is killed instantly and Katharine is seriously injured. Almásy carries her to the Cave of Swimmers, realising she is wearing the thimble he gave to her on a chain around her neck. She confesses that she has always loved him despite ending their affair. After leaving her with provisions, Almásy begins a three-day walk across the desert to get help. At British-held [[El Tag]] he attempts to explain the situation, but on revealing his name, is detained on suspicion of being a German spy and transported on a train. He escapes from the train, and soon afterwards comes in contact with a German army unit. He exchanges the survey maps in his possession for aeroplane fuel and transport to Kufra Oasis, where he refuels Madox's plane and flies back to the cave. However, he finds that Katharine has since died. He takes a letter she has written to him by torchlight to fold into his book, and he flies himself and Katharine's body away. Before long, though, the plane is shot down by German anti-aircraft guns. Almásy is badly burned and is rescued by a group of [[Bedouin]], who bring him to the [[Siwa Oasis]] from where he is moved to Italy.   After he has related his story, Almásy indicates to Hana that he wishes to die, pushing several unopened vials of morphine towards her as she gives him his regular injection for pain relief. Though visibly upset, she grants his wishes for a compassionate death and reads Katharine's final letter to him as he dies. She and Caravaggio leave the monastery for Florence with a passing army truck, and she hugs Almásy's book to herself as she rides away.  
Eraser (film)
 John Kruger - a top [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] for the [[WITSEC|Witness Security Protection Program]] (WITSEC) - specializes in "erasing" high-profile witnesses: faking their deaths to protect them from anyone that might silence them. After erasing mob witness Johnny Casteleone, Kruger is given a new assignment by his boss, Chief Arthur Beller, to protect Lee Cullen, a senior executive at Cyrez Corporation, a defense contractor. Lee warned the FBI that top-level Cyrez executives covered up the creation of a top secret [[Railgun|electromagnetic pulse rifle]] and plan to sell the weapon on the black market.  In an FBI sting operation, Lee accesses the Cyrez mainframe and downloads data on the EM rifle onto two discs: one for the FBI and one for her own protection. Vice President William Donohue, her boss, detects Lee’s intrusion and orders her into his office. After finding Lee's hidden camera and threatening her with a pistol, Donohue commits suicide in front of her. Lee delivers the disc to the FBI but, disillusioned by their broken promise to guarantee her safety, refuses Kruger's protection offer. The FBI's disc is replaced with a fake by a mole working for [[Organizational structure of the United States Department of Defense#Components of the Department of Defense|Undersecretary of Defense]] Daniel Harper, the conspiracy's mastermind.  That night, Lee's house is attacked by a mercenary team sent by Cyrez' corrupt CEO, Morehart. Kruger rescues Lee and hides her in [[New York City]], keeping her location secret even from WITSEC. Kruger learns from his mentor, Marshal Robert DeGuerin, that several witnesses have been murdered because a mole in WITSEC is leaking information and they must relocate their witnesses. Along with newcomer Deputy Monroe, they raid a remote cabin and kill mercenaries holding DeGuerin's witness hostage, but DeGuerin discreetly kills her when the mercenary leader reveals DeGuerin as the mole. Flying back to DC, Kruger, now suspicious of DeGuerin, warns Lee to relocate. DeGuerin drugs Kruger long enough to trace the warning call to NYC and kill Monroe using Kruger’s gun, framing him as the mole. DeGuerin explains he is the go-between for the black market buyer, and Kruger [[HALO jump|escapes]] from the plane to rescue Lee from DeGuerin's mercenaries; DeGuerin has Kruger and Lee branded as fugitives.  They enlist Casteleone's help and penetrate the Cyrez building. Using a mainframe backdoor in Donohue's terminal, they decrypt Lee's second disc. It reveals that the shipment of EM rifles is at the [[Baltimore]] docks and will be delivered to [[Russian Mafia]] boss Sergei Ivanovich Petrofsky, who plans to sell the weapons overseas to [[terrorism|terrorists]]. A Cyrez operative pinpoints their whereabouts and remotely destroys the disc; DeGuerin kidnaps Lee and takes her to the docks as the shipment is being loaded onto Petrofsky's Russian freighter.  Casteleone contacts his mobster cousin Tony Two-Toes and his two associates to help Kruger raid the docks. They kill Petrovsky, his henchmen, and DeGuerin's mercenaries. In a struggle atop a shipping container, DeGuerin holds Lee hostage, but Kruger frees her and destroys the lock on the [[container crane]], dropping DeGuerin and the container to the ground and exposing the presence of the EM rifles. Kruger rescues the critically wounded DeGuerin, leaving him to be detained by Beller and the authorities and proving his and Lee's innocence.  Weeks later, Kruger brings Lee to a hearing for DeGuerin, Harper, and Morehart, who are indicted for treason. With little confidence that her testimony could secure their convictions, Kruger and Lee publicly fake their deaths in a car explosion. In the back of a limo, DeGuerin congratulates Harper on their deaths and says that they should go back into black-market business as soon as possible, but looks astonished when Harper says that he assumed DeGuerin had killed them. The men are confused, then shocked as their limo stops on a train track and the driver, actually Casteleone, locks the doors and exits the vehicle. Kruger calls DeGuerin and tells him "You've just been erased" as they see a train heading right for them. They can’t escape before the train slams into the limo, killing all three. Kruger waves goodbye to Casteleone and walks over to Lee in a waiting car, telling her "they caught a train."  
Escape from L.A.
 In 1998, [[Los Angeles]] has become immensely crime-ridden and decadent, ultimately being directly governed and patrolled by the recently created [[United States]] Police Force. Two years later, on August 23, 2000, a massive earthquake strikes the city, the [[San Fernando Valley]] floods, and the Los Angeles area turns into an island from [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] to [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]. A [[theocracy|theocratic]] Presidential candidate declares L.A. to be sinful and punished by God.  When he is elected President for life, he declares that anyone not conforming to the new "Moral America" laws he creates, which ban such things as tobacco, alcoholic beverages, recreational drugs, red meat, firearms, profanity, [[atheism]], freedom of religion and extra-marital sex, will be stripped of their citizenship and deported to Los Angeles Island unless they repent and choose [[electric chair|death by electrocution]]. A containment wall is built around the island, armed guards and watchtowers are posted, and those sent to the island are exiled permanently.  Thirteen years later, Cuervo Jones, a [[Shining Path]] Peruvian Revolutionary, seduces the President's daughter, Utopia, via a holographic system and brainwashes her into stealing her father's remote control to the "[[Damocles#Sword of Damocles|Sword of Damocles]]" super weapon&mdash;a series of satellites capable of [[Electromagnetic_pulse|rendering all electronic devices anywhere on the planet useless]]. The President intends to use the system to destroy America's enemies' ability to function and eventually dominate the world. While traveling aboard ''Air Force Three'', Utopia leaves the plane in an escape pod and lands on L.A. Island to join with Cuervo.  With the satellites under his control, Cuervo promises to take back America with the assistance of an allied invasion force of [[third world]] nations that are standing by to attack. Cuervo claims that if the President tries to stop him, he will "pull the plug" on the country and black out the capital. Cuervo also knows the secret world code that can knock out power for the entire planet.  Snake Plissken is captured for another series of crimes and is scheduled to be exiled to Los Angeles Island. Upon his arrival for deportation, Snake meets the President and is offered the mission of retrieving the weapon. The President says he will give him a full pardon if he is successful. The President indicates he does not care if Utopia is returned or not, declaring her a traitor. To ensure his compliance, Snake is infected with the man-made Plutoxin 7 virus that will kill him within ten hours. If he completes the mission, Snake will be cured.  Snake is given an assault rifle, a personal holographic projector, a thermal-camouflage overcoat, and a countdown clock for how long he has to live. Snake sneaks into the city with a mini submarine that he loses when the platform it landed on crumbles, causing the sub to sink. Making his way across the island, Snake meets "Map to the Stars" Eddie, a swindler who sells interactive tours of L.A..  Snake defeats Cuervo at his staging area of [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|The Happy Kingdom By The Sea]] in Anaheim and takes the remote control. Snake leaves the island with Utopia and some other Cuervo resistors in a helicopter. Cuervo shoots at it with a rocket launcher just before Eddie kills him, but seeing the incoming rocket, Eddie leaps off the chopper, landing on an awning. The rocket hits the chopper and kills those in the back of the chopper but also causes a fire; Snake and Utopia bail out before it crashes. When the President's men reach the crash site, Commander Malloy believes that Snake is trying to trick the President by giving him the wrong remote and proceeds to find on Utopia another one.  After checking the disc inside, Commander Malloy announces that they will take the one that Utopia unknowingly had in her possession.  The President then has his men take Utopia to the electric chair despite her pleas for forgiveness. The Plutoxin 7 virus is revealed to be nothing more than a fast, hard-hitting case of the flu. The President tries using the satellites to stop a Cuban invasion force threatening Florida. Activating the remote, the President hears only Eddie's "Map to the Stars" intro over "[[I Love L.A.]]".  The President orders Snake's execution but Snake previously activated his hologram projector and the Snake that gets shot is an illusion. Snake activates the real control device, entering the world-code and ending all technological activity on the planet, against pleas to stop. At the deportation center, Utopia expresses her surprise that Snake shut down the Earth and thus saved her. Snake lights a cigarette and blows out the match used to light it, uttering "Welcome to the human race."

Executive Decision
 [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Austin Travis leads an unsuccessful [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] raid on a [[Chechen mafia]] safe house in [[Italy]] to recover a stolen Soviet nerve agent, DZ-5. Shortly after, [[Oceanic Airlines]] Flight 343 leaves [[Athens]], [[Greece]], bound for [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], with U.S. Senator Mavros onboard. Nagi Hassan, lieutenant of the imprisoned terrorist leader El Sayed Jaffa, and his men hijack the flight, demanding Jaffa's release.  Dr. David Grant, a [[United States Naval Academy]] graduate and now a consultant for the U.S. Army's intelligence community, and DARPA engineer Cahill join a team led by Travis to intercept the plane. After listening to Hassan's demands, Grant disbelieves that Hassan wants Jaffa released. Instead, he thinks Hassan engineered Jaffa's capture and plans to use the plane to detonate a bomb loaded with the DZ-5 gas over U.S. airspace in a suicide mission. The Pentagon authorizes a mid-air transfer of an [[United States Army|Army]] special operations team onto the hijacked airliner using the experimental airplane "Remora F117x".  The boarding is only partially successful. When a commando, "Cappy," is seriously injured with a broken neck, Grant boards to assist Cappy. The Oceanic Airlines [[Boeing 747|747]] pulls up, though, putting too much stress on the boarding sleeve. Unable to board, Travis sacrifices himself by closing the 747's hatch before the stealth craft is torn off and crashes. The survivors enter the 747's lower deck, but with half their equipment and no communication, leaving the Pentagon unaware of their survival. With limited options, the commandos search for the supposed bomb. Grant makes contact with a flight attendant, Jean, and recruits her despite Hassan's suspicions.  U.S. officials release Jaffa to resolve the situation. Meanwhile, the team locates the bomb, and despite his injuries Cappy guides Cahill in disarming it. The remaining team readies to take control of the aircraft, when Cappy discovers that the bomb's arming device has an additional, remote-controlled trigger. Jaffa calls Hassan from a private jet, telling him he is free and on his way to Algeria, but Hassan abruptly ends the call. Grant and the others realize Hassan's men don't know about the bomb and his true intentions, which means that one of the passengers is a sleeper agent and the trigger man for the bomb. Hassan also shoots one of his men dead after he rebukes him.  Jean spots a man with an electronic device and informs Grant. Mavros is called to speak to the [[President of the United States]], only to realize he is to be sacrificed as a warning that Hassan is serious, and is shot by Hassan. Meanwhile, the soldiers use the plane's taillights via [[Morse code]] to signal escorting U.S. Navy [[F-14 Tomcat]] jets that they are on board.  Grant and Jean enter the passenger cabin and take the suspected individual by surprise, but he turns out to be the wrong target. Grant spots the real sleeper: Jean-Paul Demou, the man who built the bomb. Hassan attempts to fire at Grant, but is shot by an onboard [[Federal Air Marshal Service|federal air marshal]], and the commandos storm the cabin, where a firefight ensues. Stray bullets break passenger windows, causing [[uncontrolled decompression|explosive decompression]] which blows  several passengers and Demou out of the plane. The subordinate terrorists are killed during the exchange, the bomb is disarmed, and the plane regains its stability. In a last act of desperation, a seriously wounded Hassan shoots at the cockpit and surrounding area (killing both pilots, hoping the plane will crash) before wounded commando "Rat" kills him.  Grant assumes control of the 747 and attempts to land it at [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] despite his limited piloting experience. He [[missed approach|misses the approach]], forcing him to go around. As the plane begins to climb, Grant recognizes the area surrounding [[Frederick Municipal Airport (Maryland)|Frederick Field]], where he normally practices flying. Deciding to land the 747 there, with Jean's assistance Grant makes a sloppy but safe landing into a sand berm at the runway's overrun area, where emergency workers are able to safely evacuate the passengers.  The film concludes with Grant being saluted by Rat and the team for his leadership. He is then summoned by the Pentagon and invites Jean to accompany him.  
The Evening Star
 Years have passed since the death of her daughter, Emma. Aurora Greenway is still her usual strong, willful self, but all is not well with the three grandchildren she raised after Emma's death, particularly eldest boy Tommy, who is serving time in jail on a drug charge.  Younger grandson Teddy now has a girlfriend and a son. Melanie (who is both the youngest and the only girl out of the three grandkids), is all but grown and still living with Aurora at home but giving serious thought to moving out. Aurora's only true companion is housekeeper Rosie, particularly now that a man she's been spending time with, the General, is a friend, not a romance.  Her late daughter's old friend, Patsy, still has a home in Houston and thinks of herself as Aurora's friend now, dispensing advice to Melanie, something that Aurora does not appreciate.  Rosie is being courted by an elderly gentleman named Arthur, who has bought astronaut Garrett Breedlove's former house next door. On seeing how lonely Aurora obviously is, Rosie tricks her into seeing a licensed counselor, Jerry, to whom Aurora admits that she is still seeking "the love of my life."  Thoroughly unprofessional in almost every way, Jerry jumps into a romantic situation with Aurora himself. However, he has an ulterior motive, which she soon learns. Aurora is cheered up only by a brief visit from Garrett, who advises her to find that true love soon because "there aren't that many shopping days left till Christmas."  Needing a cause, Aurora decides to take charge after Melanie moves to California to try to become an actress. She is peeved to discover that Patsy has exactly the same idea. Melanie succeeds in landing a role on a television show. Aurora comes home to a new problem, however, when it turns out that Rosie is critically ill. She is left once more facing the prospect of being alone.  
Evita (1996 film)
 In a cinema in [[Buenos Aires]] on July 26, 1952, a film is interrupted when news breaks of the death of [[Eva Perón]], Argentina's [[First Ladies and Gentlemen of Argentina|First Lady]], at the age of 33. As the nation goes into public mourning, Ché, a member of the public, marvels at the spectacle and promises to show how Eva did "nothing, for years". The rest of the film follows Eva (born Eva Duarte) from her beginnings as an illegitimate child of a lower-class family to her rise to become First Lady and [[Spiritual Leader of the Nation of Argentina]]; Ché assumes many different guises throughout Eva's story.  At the age of 15, Eva lives in the provincial town of [[Junín, Buenos Aires|Junín]], and longs for a better life in Buenos Aires. She persuades a tango singer, [[Agustín Magaldi]], with whom she is having an affair, to take her to the city. After Magaldi leaves her, she goes through several relationships with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality. She meets Colonel [[Juan Perón]] at a fundraiser following the [[1944 San Juan earthquake]]. Perón's connection with Eva adds to his populist image, since they are both from the working class. Eva has a radio show during Perón's rise and uses all of her skills to promote him, even when the controlling administration has him jailed in an attempt to stunt his political momentum. The groundswell of support that Eva generates forces the government to release Perón, and he finds the people enamored of him and Eva. Perón wins election to the [[President of Argentina|presidency]] and marries Eva, who promises that the new government will serve the ''[[descamisados]]''.  At the start of the Perón government, Eva dresses glamorously, enjoying the privileges of being the First Lady. Soon after, she embarks on what is called her "Rainbow Tour" to Europe. While there, she receives a mixed reception. The people of Spain adore her, the people of Italy call her a whore and throw things at her, and [[Pope Pius XII]] gives her a small, meager gift. Upon returning to Argentina, Eva establishes a foundation to help the poor. The film suggests the [[Peronism|Perónists]] otherwise plunder the public treasury.  Eva is hospitalized and learns that she has cancer. She declines the position of Vice President due to her failing health, and makes one final broadcast to the people of Argentina. She understands that her life was short because she shone like the "brightest fire", and helps Perón prepare to go on without her. A large crowd surrounds the [[Casa Rosada]] in a candlelight vigil praying for her recovery when the light of her room goes out, signifying her death. At Eva's funeral, Ché is seen at her coffin, marveling at the influence of her brief life. He walks up to her glass coffin, kisses it, and joins the crowd of passing mourners.  
Eva Perón: The True Story
 The movie does not offer a linear interpretation of the full life of [[Eva Perón]]. Instead, it focuses on the political disputes during the last year of Eva's life. These disputes involved [[women's suffrage]] in Argentina, failed coup attempts against the Peronist government, and Eva's failed bid for the vice presidency. The movie concludes with Eva's death in 1952.

Fargo (film)
 In the winter of 1987, Jerry Lundegaard, the sales manager at an [[Oldsmobile]] dealership in [[Minneapolis]], is desperate for money. He floated a $320,000 [[Ally Financial|GMAC]] loan and collateralized it with nonexistent dealership vehicles and is unable to pay back the loan. On the advice of dealership mechanic and paroled ex-convict Shep Proudfoot, Jerry travels to [[Fargo, North Dakota]] and hires small-time cons Gaear Grimsrud and Carl Showalter to kidnap his wife, Jean, and extort a ransom from his wealthy father-in-law and boss, Wade Gustafson, in return for a new car and half of the $80,000 ransom.  Jerry pitches Gustafson a lucrative real estate deal, and he agrees to front $750,000. Jerry considers calling off the kidnapping, but learns that Gustafson plans to make the deal himself, giving Jerry a finder's fee. At Jerry's home, Carl and Gaear carry out the kidnapping. As they transport Jean to their remote cabin on [[Moose Lake Township, Cass County, Minnesota|Moose Lake]], a state trooper pulls them over outside [[Brainerd, Minnesota|Brainerd]] for driving without temporary tags. When the trooper hears a sound from the back seat, Gaear kills him, then chases down two eyewitnesses and shoots them.  The following morning, Brainerd police chief [[Marge Gunderson]] discovers that the dead trooper was ticketing a car with dealership plates. Later, two men driving a dealership vehicle checked into the nearby Blue Ox Motel with two call girls, then placed a call to Proudfoot. After questioning the prostitutes, she drives to Gustafson's dealership, where Proudfoot feigns ignorance and Jerry insists no cars are missing. While in Minneapolis, Marge reconnects with Mike Yanagita, an old classmate. Mike awkwardly and aggressively tries to romance Marge, before breaking down, saying his wife has died.  Jerry informs Gustafson that the kidnappers have demanded $1 million, and will deal only through him. Meanwhile, Carl, in light of the complication of three murders, demands that Jerry hand over the entire $80,000. GMAC gives Jerry 24 hours to prove the existence of the vehicles or return the loan.  Carl is beaten by a furious Proudfoot for bringing him under suspicion. Carl orders Jerry to deliver the ransom immediately. Gustafson insists on making the money drop himself. At the drop point in a Minneapolis parking garage, he tells Carl he will not hand over the money without seeing Jean. An enraged Carl shoots and kills Gustafson, but not before Gustafson shoots Carl in the face. After fleeing the scene, Carl is astounded to discover that the briefcase contains $1 million. He removes $80,000 to split with Gaear, then buries the rest alongside the highway. At the cabin, Gaear has killed Jean; Carl says they must split up and leave the state immediately. Carl and Gaear get into a heated argument over who will keep the dealership car with Carl using his injury as justification. In response, Gaear kills Carl with an axe.  Marge learns that Yanagita's dead wife is neither dead nor his wife. Reflecting on Yanagita's convincing lies, Marge returns to Gustafson's dealership. Jerry continues to insist that he is not missing any cars. Marge asks him to check the inventory, then spots him fleeing the dealership, and calls the State Police. The next morning, she drives to Moose Lake on a tip from a local bar owner who reported a "funny-looking guy" bragging about killing someone. Outside a cabin, she finds the dealership car; nearby, Gaear is feeding Carl's dismembered body into a woodchipper. Marge shoots him in the leg as he tries to flee, and arrests him. North Dakota police arrest Jerry at a motel outside [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]].  Marge's husband Norm, whose mallard painting has been selected for a 3-cent postage stamp, complains that his friend's painting will be on the first class stamp. Marge reassures Norm that lots of people use 3-cent stamps; the two happily anticipate the birth of their child in two months.

Karen's perfect world is suddenly shattered when Julie is violently raped and murdered while Karen listens helplessly on the phone from her car.  Detective Sergeant Joe Denillo assures Karen there is enough [[DNA]] evidence to find and convict the killer.  He encourages the McCanns to seek [[counseling]].  At a [[support group]], they meet people in similar circumstances, including Albert and Regina Gratz, and Sidney Hughes.  During the meeting, Karen overhears Albert talking to Sidney about something which alarms Regina.  The DNA tests reveal the killer, Robert Doob, a delivery man with a criminal record.  At the trial it is clear Doob is guilty, but because the defense did not receive a sample of the DNA evidence, the judge dismisses the case.  Karen and Mack are dumbstruck as Doob walks free. When Doob launches an antagonizing apology at Karen it causes Mack to snap and furiously attack Doob, but is overpowered by guards and Doob walks out unharmed.

After observing Doob urinate on a customer's lawn after a delivery she goes to Denillo — but he tells her there's no evidence of intent.  Karen attempts to warn the delivery customer, but the woman only speaks [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and does not understand her.  Karen later learns that the murderer of the son of a member of her support group has been killed in a [[drive-by shooting]], just days after being released from prison.  Angel, also in the self-help group, tells Karen the best way to get over her grief is to focus on having good experiences with her living daughter — and Karen realizes she has been so fixated on Doob that Megan has been deprived of her attention.  Meanwhile, Doob has gone to Megan's school and struck up a conversation with the girl during recess.  When Karen comes to pick up Megan, Doob deliberately intimidates her.  Worried for Megan’s safety, Karen's sanity is on the rocks and remembers what happened to the killer of her friend's son and approaches Sidney, who admits the [[drive-by shooting]] was set up by him and Martin.  Karen demands their help and they agree to find a weapon, train her, and plan the murder, but tell her she has to carry it out.  Karen agrees and they begin plotting.

Although Martin doubts Karen is capable of murder, Sidney gives her a gun.  The next day, Angel reveals that she is really an undercover [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Agent]] investigating [[vigilante]] activity.  Angel warns Karen not to kill Doob.  Karen calls Sidney to tell him she cannot go through with it.  However, she soon changes her mind when she learns that the [[Hispanic]] customer she tried to warn about Doob has been raped and murdered just as Julie had been.  Karen is so furious she accuses Denillo of not finding enough evidence, letting Doob go free.  Hearing Doob has again gotten off on a technicality bolsters her resolve.  Karen decides that the only way to avenge her daughter's murder and save her family from Doob is to kill him.  She sets a trap to lure Doob into her home, so that she can say killing him was self-defense.  It works.  She shoots Doob dead and calls the police.  Denillo arrives and tells Karen that he knows the truth and that she hasn't fooled him, to which she replies, "Prove it."  He decides to tell his colleague that it was a "clear case of self-defense".  When her husband arrives, he sits beside her, holding her hand, knowing what she has done.  
The Fan (1996 film)
  Gil Renard is a divorced knife salesman, and his personal relationship with his son have estranged. His ex-wife, Ellen, obtains a restraining order to keep him away from herself and their son. Gil is fired from his job when he threatens a prospective customer.  Gil is a fan of the [[San Francisco Giants]], and he is obsessed with their newest player, Bobby Rayburn. Rayburn suffers a chest injury that causes fans to be upset by his under performance, causing Gil to show aggression to fans that jeer Rayburn. Rayburn is seen fighting with teammate Juan Primo in the restroom of a bar, after which Gil confronts Primo in a hotel [[sauna]], and stabs him to death. Although Rayburn is suspected of the death, his performance improves, and Gil believes that what he did was good for Rayburn and the team.  Gil is thinking that Rayburn does not acknowledge his fans much. Gil goes to Rayburn's beach house and saves Rayburn's son from drowning. Gil persuades Rayburn to play a friendly game of catch on the beach. Rayburn says he stopped caring about the game after Primo's death, because he felt there were more important things in life. He makes the mistake of telling Gil that he has lost respect for the fans, remarking on their fickle nature &mdash; when he's hitting, they love him, but when he's not, they hate him. Gil's temper rises as he almost hits Rayburn with a fastball, and launches into a diatribe. Rayburn is slightly disturbed, especially when Gil takes off his jacket to reveal Rayburn's [[jersey]] underneath and wonders if Rayburn is happy that Primo's not around.  Rayburn soon discovers that his son has been kidnapped by Gil. He finds a piece of Primo's branded shoulder in the freezer. Disillusioned with Rayburn's disrespect towards the fans, Gil spirals further into insanity. He acts as though Sean is his own son. He drives to see an old friend, Coop, a catcher that Gil spoke often of playing baseball with in his past. Coop tries to help Sean escape, and reveals that the only time he and Gil ever played together was in the [[Little League Baseball|Little League]]. Gil then beats Coop to death with a baseball bat, and takes Sean to a baseball field, hiding him there. He contacts Rayburn to make one demand: hit a home run in the upcoming game and dedicate it to Gil, or he will kill his son. With the police on high alert, Gil enters [[Candlestick Park]] in the midst of an on-and-off thunderstorm. Rayburn struggles with his emotions while at bat. After several pitches, he finally hits the ball deep into the outfield but not over the fence. Rayburn attempts to score an inside-the-park home run. He is called out, even though he is obviously safe. Rayburn argues with the [[umpire]], who turns out to be Gil in disguise.  Rayburn knocks Gil to the ground. Dozens of cops swarm onto the field and confront Gil. Before the cops arrive, Gil kills another player, Lanz, who tries to tackle him. Despite warnings from the police, Gil goes into an exaggerated pitching motion with a knife in hand. He asks Rayburn if he cares about baseball, but realizes that he cares "just a little bit." Gil is shot dead as he is about to throw the knife. Police discover Sean at the Little League baseball field, where Gil once played in his childhood. They uncover his obsession with Rayburn, as hundreds of newspaper clippings adorn the deranged fan's hideout. A picture on the wall shows Gil in his past glory, playing Little League baseball and winning a game.  
Extreme Measures
 Dr. Guy Luthan ([[Hugh Grant]]) is a New York emergency room doctor who one night comes across a strange patient: a homeless man who has a wristband from a hospital he's not familiar with, mentioning a drug he's never heard of, and with strange symptoms, including a wildly fluctuating heart rate. When the man dies, Guy attempts to follow up and find out more about the patient - only to find that the body and all records have disappeared, and he's told by his superiors to drop the case.  As he continues trying to find out what happened, Guy's personal and professional life get suddenly sidetracked. His home is ransacked and cocaine is planted near his bedside. The police arrest him and he is convicted and in the process he loses his job, his license to practice medicine and all of his friends. In desperation, he manages to get the help of some homeless men who lead him to [[mole people|their underground home]]. His ER patient who died also had lived there. Through them he's led to an organization, led by neurosurgeon Dr. Lawrence Myrick ([[Gene Hackman]]), that performs spinal experiments on the homeless people, all of whom have died thus far, in an attempt to find a cure for paralysis.  Myrick attempts to sway Guy to join his team, telling him that his “test subjects” are heroes, and that killing one to save millions is worth the sacrifice.  Guy admits that while there is some truth in what Myrick says, Myrick’s victims did not choose to give up their lives, which makes Myrick a murderer. Myrick is accidentally shot and killed by rogue FBI Agent Frank Hare ([[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]]).  Later, Myrick’s widow hands the discs and documentation regarding the research to Guy telling him "my husband was trying to do a good thing, but in the wrong way".

Family Resemblances
 An average French family ostensibly celebrates a birthday in a restaurant. In one evening and during one meal, family history, tensions, collective and separate grudges, delights, and memories both clash and coalesce. Indeed, poking each other's sore spots turns out to be the main order of business. Henri (Bacri) runs a saloon that he inherited from his father called "The Sleepy Dad," and in the near-empty bar, he plays host to several members of the family as they mark the 35th birthday of his sister-in-law, Yolande (Frot). Henri's sister, Betty (Jaoui), is 30, single, and not very happy about it; his brother (and Yolande's husband), Philippe (Yordanoff), is an executive in a growing software company; Mother (Maurier) is the siblings' strong-willed matriarch; and Henri's paralyzed dog is on hand, whom someone describes as "like a rug, but alive." It's not been a good day for most of them: Philippe is anxious that his boss might not have liked the tie he wore on television; Betty is depressed about the sad state of her current relationship; Henri has just learned that his wife is leaving him; and Mother is tossing caustic barbs at everyone left and right. Henri's bartender Denis (Darroussin) is the one neutral party on hand, and he provides the voice of reason in the midst of the bickering.  
A Family Thing
  The film is a drama about a [[Scotch-Irish American]] [[Southern United States|Southerner]] (Duvall) named Earl Pilcher, whose late mother makes a shocking revelation in a letter that is given to him after her death. She reveals that Earl's biological mother was a [[Black American]] maid named Willa Mae, who was raped by Earl's (white) father and that she died while giving birth to Earl. His adoptive mother's dying wish is that he go to [[Chicago]] to meet his half-brother, Raymond Murdock (Jones).   Earl initially takes the unexpected news of his mixed parentage badly, tearfully challenging his father to confirm the facts in the letter. Old and feeble, his father refuses to discuss the letter, but admits it is true. As a result, Earl packs up his clothes and takes off for Chicago to find his brother.    He meets Ray at city hall (where Ray works as a police officer) and Ray, although he really wants nothing to do with Earl, agrees to meet him for lunch at a diner.   During lunch, Ray reveals that he knew all along that he had a half white brother and that he hates Earl's father (and Earl too by association) because he feels Earl's birth is what killed his mother.  He says in so many words that he doesn't want or need a brother, and they go their separate ways.  But when Earl leaves and drives off in his truck he encounters four black Chicago street toughs who rear end his truck.  When Earl gets out to survey the (minimal) damage, he, being a trusting Southern "good ol' boy", leaves his keys in the ignition. The toughs beat him up and steal his truck and his wallet.  He walks around in a daze and ends up in a hospital. The hospital staff finds Ray's information in Earl's pocket and calls Ray.  He comes reluctantly, and the doctor tells him that Earl may have a concussion and needs to take it easy for a couple of days; no traveling is allowed. She also tells him that the hospital is full, so he will have to take Earl home to recuperate.    At Ray's home, Earl meets Aunt T (Hall), a kind and generous elderly woman who is blind. Aunt T. is Willa Mae's sister, and thus, Earl's aunt.   Earl also meets Ray's son, Virgil (Beach), a surly and hostile city bus driver who doesn't appreciate a white southerner sleeping in his bed. At first, Earl's stay at the Murdoch residence is rocky.   Ray explains that Earl is an old war buddy whose life he saved, but Virgil is skeptical.  During a grocery shopping excursion with Earl, Aunt T reveals that she knows who Earl really is.  In a powerful scene, Aunt T scolds Ray and Virgil for not welcoming a member of their family, no matter how different he is. Earl overhears the discussion and leaves Ray's house, walking unknowingly into a bad part of town.  Ray gives in to Aunt T's wish that he welcome Earl into their home, and he quickly locates him on a nearby street. Earl obstinately refuses to come back with Ray, knowing he is not wanted. The two argue, ending up in an awkward wrestling match, and Earl uses the word "nigger" to punctuate his disdain for Ray, seeing too late that he has gone too far. Angry at Earl's callous words, Ray tells Earl to stay away from him, and he heads back home.  Meanwhile, Earl wanders Chicago and gets drunk at a Chicago bar, where he is tossed out for bothering a black couple. He ends up sleeping under a bridge. The next day, Ray has cooled down and, again on Aunt T.'s wishes, manages to find Earl, who apologizes for his words and rude behavior. The two begin to settle their differences.   When Virgil's estranged wife (played by [[Regina Taylor]]) and their two daughters visit, Earl learns that Virgil had a promising career in football that was shattered by an injury in college. Virgil cannot cope with the missed opportunities caused by his injury, and, the resulting bitterness has hurt his relationship with his family.  Ray and Earl bond together more as they find similarities between them. Both served in the military (Earl as a firefighter in the [[United States Navy]], and Ray in the [[U.S. Marines]]) during the [[Korean War]], where they received lifelong scars.  Ray reveals that as a child, he once threw a rock at Earl that could have blinded him, because of Ray's hatred towards Earl's father.  Later on, in a bar, Earl takes Virgil aside and explains to him that by dwelling on the loss of his football career, he isn't devoting himself to his wife and children in the way he should. Both of them begin to have a grudging respect for the other.  Once Earl is ready to go home, and the police unexpectedly find his truck operational (it was shot up in a bank robbery), Aunt T. sits Earl and Ray down to tell them the dramatic tale of the night Earl was born and Willa Mae died.  According to Aunt T., Willa Mae knew she was likely to die and Earl's life was saved only by the quick action of his adoptive mother, Carrie, who brought a white doctor to the shack where Willa Mae and Ray lived to help with the delivery.  Aunt T speculates that Carrie and Willa Mae agreed that Earl, who was born with white-appearing features, should be raised by Carrie and his biological father. Aunt T. gives Earl a picture of Willa Mae which he keeps near.  Earl begins to accept his new family with pride, and he convinces Ray to return to their Arkansas hometown to find their mother's grave. As they share a drink on her tombstone, Earl decides to take Ray to meet his southern family and tell them the unlikely story, ending the movie by joking with Ray that when Earl's ''white'' nephew finds out he is part black, he will likely want to fight the both of them.

While in school, a peon fraudulently puts drugs in Suman's handbag. Inspector Sule tells her that she has to be arrested in a drugs case, but Inspector Inder informs her that she is free to go as the drugs were put by the peon and he has confessed. The peon is shown dead on the floor with blood on his face.  Dr. Verma invites Inspector Inder to their home for dinner. Inder arrives with Soley. While they are partying, Inder starts asking them about children, to which both get depressed. Next day, Inder invites Verma to a men-only party. After the party, Inder takes Verma to an area where only criminals live. He goes inside and brings a man—the same person who came as a burglar in Verma's house. Inder asks Verma to take his revenge, but Verma refuses and says that he cannot take the life of any person. To this, Inder frees the burglar, but shoots him while he is escaping. Verma reaches home and tells his wife that Inder is a psycho and that she should maintain a distance from him. To this, Suman tells him that whatever Inder did was right. The next day, Inder meets Suman and justifies his actions saying that the burglar deserved this punishment. Inder then arrives at a party, given in honour of Dr. Verma. Verma tells him to leave, but he refuses. Inder is in reality lusting for Verma's wife Suman and is trying every possible way to attract her towards him. Next day, Inder meets Suman and asks her the reason for not having a child. Suman tells him that two years earlier, while she was pregnant, she fell down the stairs. Dr. Verma was busy in an emergency duty and could not come to the hospital to see her and she lost the child. She regrets that if Verma had come that day, they would not have lost the child.  The next night, Inder calls a prostitute ([[Kunika|Kunika Lal]]) to his house and tells her to behave like Suman. But when she calls him Raja, Inder beats her black and blue and tells her that you are not Suman and the day will come when Suman will fall for him. Inder's friend Inspector Sule warns him to stop interfering in the life of Dr. Verma and Suman and that if he continues to do that, he will report this matter to the ACP. Inder ignores the warning and disconnects the telephone and electricity connection of Verma's house. At night, he enters Verma's house where Rohan and Suman are having sex. While finding Inder at such an uninviting position at his house, Rohan gets furious and along with his lawyer (Sunil Dhawan) goes to the ACP to lodge a complaint against Inder. Inder then kills the prostitute and his friend Sule and tells the ACP that both of them were involved in dealing of drugs, which were supplied by Dr. Verma. He then tricks Verma into the drugs case and gets him arrested. At night, Inder reaches Verma's house. He first kills Suman's friend Neeta (Divya Jaiswal) and then goes after Suman. On the other hand, Verma tricks the police and escape from their custody. Upon reaching his house, he engages in a fierce battle with Inder. In the end, Dr. Verma kills Inder in an act of self-defence.

Fear (1996 film)
  16-year-old Nicole Walker ([[Reese Witherspoon]]) lives in the suburbs of [[Seattle]] with her overbearing father Steven ([[William Petersen]]), his new wife Laura ([[Amy Brenneman]]), and Toby (Christopher Gray), Laura's son from her first marriage. At a bar with her best friend Margo ([[Alyssa Milano]]), Nicole meets David McCall ([[Mark Wahlberg]]), and is instantly swept off her feet by his good looks and sweet, charming nature. The two begin a relationship.  When Steven meets David, he mistrusts him immediately. Although David is nice to Nicole, he keeps her out past curfew and soon shows an aggressive nature when he assaults her friend Gary ([[Todd Caldecott]]). He shoves Nicole to the ground when she tries to stop him, giving her a black eye. Nicole breaks up with David but, ultimately, she changes her mind and the two continue their relationship. They eventually sleep together while Steven and Laura are away on a business trip. Still suspicious, Steven checks into David's background and learns that David has had a severely troubled life in foster care. Steven confronts David on a street corner and demands he leaves Nicole alone. David spins the encounter against Steven; he makes it look like Steven punched him, which gains Nicole's sympathy.  One evening, Nicole is invited by David to a party at his friend Logan's (Tracy Fraim) house. She declines at first but then has a fight with her father and drives to Logan's alone. Through a window, she witnesses Margo smoking crack and having sex with David. Nicole leaves without being seen. The next day at school, David finds himself being pushed away by Nicole for his disloyalty. Nicole also ends her friendship with Margo, although Margo insists that David raped her while she was high. With the relationship over, David becomes obsessed with Nicole, tattooing his own chest with her name. David follows Margo in his car and crashes into her; he chokes her and threatens he will hurt her more if she doesn't fix things for him. David then sees Nicole hugging Gary outside school and, as Gary walks home alone, David follows and kills him.  Nicole goes with Laura and Toby to the mall, where David corners her in the women's restroom, claiming they have something special and demanding her to be his forever. At the same time, Steven finds his Mustang vandalized by David who has left a note reading "Now I've popped both your cherries!". Furious, Steven breaks into the house David shares with Logan and finds an obscene shrine he has built for Nicole. He also finds a vandalized bracelet (it read "Daddy's Girl" but has been changed to "David's Girl"), a pair of Nicole's panties, a defaced family photo (Steven's head has been replaced with David's). Steven trashes the house in anger.  Later, David returns home and promptly realizes Steven has been there. He decides to break into the Walker residence with the help of his four equally violent housemates: Logan, Hacker ([[Gary Riley]]), Knobby ([[Jed Rees]]) and Terry (Jason Kristofer). A distraught Margo is already at Nicole's house, where she informs the Walker's that Gary has been found dead. Upon arriving at the house, David and his gang behead Kaiser, the family dog. David tries to enter using the code to the main door that Nicole once told him, but Steven and Laura barricade everyone inside, while Nicole, Margo and Toby hide upstairs. Laura injures Hacker with a drill who is then taken to hospital by Knobby. Using a flashlight, Nicole sends an SOS to Larry, the Walker's private security guard, who arrives to confront the situation, but he is shot dead by Terry.  David, Logan and Terry eventually force their way in and take Steven hostage, using Larry's handcuffs to shackle up him and Laura. When Logan forces himself onto Nicole, Margo intervenes but is knocked unconscious. Toby escapes through another window and gets to Laura's [[SUV]]. He uses her car phone to dial [[9-1-1]]. Toby has to start the engine to make the phone work; Terry notices this and shoots out the windshield. It misses Toby, who then runs Terry down by reversing the SUV out of the garage. Retrieving Larry's keys, Toby sneaks inside and un-cuffs both his parents. David shoots Logan dead for trying to rape Nicole, then asks her if she's ready to leave with him, which will save her family. Steven rushes at David and the pair get into a furious brawl. David gets ready to execute Steven but Nicole prevents this by stabbing David in the back with a peace pipe (which David himself won for Nicole at a carnival on one of their dates). Both men continue to fight until Steven pushes David through her bedroom window to his death on the rocks below.   Nicole and her father embrace, knowing they are safe.  
Female Perversions
 Eve Stephens, a successful trial attorney in Los Angeles, is close to the high point of her career, which is being appointed as a judge. Her private life is less successful, however. She has occasional intense sex, sometimes with a male geologist John and sometimes with a female psychiatrist Renee, but the relationships lack warmth or commitment on her part. She is troubled by erotic nightmares and by flashbacks to the lives of her parents, centring on her unfeeling father and the suspicious death of her mother.   Both her professional and personal lives start unravelling when her intelligent but disturbed sister Maddie, who lives in a desert cabin, is arrested for repeated shoplifting. In the end, the two sisters begin to recognise the malign influence of their parents on their lives and the unsatisfactory responses they unconsciously adopted, one seeking compensation in stealing and the other in sex.  
First Kid
 Sam Simms ([[Sinbad (entertainer)|Sinbad]]) is a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent assigned by his superior Wilkes ([[Robert Guillaume]]) to protect President Paul Davenport's ([[James Naughton]]) rebellious 13-year-old son Luke Davenport ([[Brock Pierce]]) after Luke's behavior causes another agent Woods ([[Timothy Busfield]]) to be replaced for mistreating Luke in front of media cameras.   Woods is later fired because of this mistreatment and for failing his physical. Simms sees this assignment as undesirable, but a possible stepping stone to protecting the President. He fails to connect with the boy at first, and Luke continues to misbehave, including an incident where he releases his pet snake Poison into a White House party.   After seeing Luke get beat up by the school bully Rob ([[Zachery Ty Bryan]]), his parents punished him for the fight, even though he didn't start the fight. Because of the re-election, they can't risk Luke going out of public for a month while his parents are on the campaign trail. Simms feels sorry for him - he had felt alone as a teenager, too (losing his father in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] while his mother worked many jobs to financially support him) - and they become friends. Simms, a former boxer, agrees to sneak Luke out against the wishes of the chief of security Morton ([[Art LaFleur]]) and teach him how to fight.  Meanwhile, Luke agonizes over asking the cutest girl, Katie, to the school dance, which he finally does successfully with Simms's help. On the night of the dance, a backpack is left outside of the White House and Luke is not allowed to go due to the security risk, even though his parents gave him permission. Simms pities him and, breaking the rules again, he takes him to the dance. There, Rob tries to attack Luke again while Simms is distracted, but this time Luke puts him down.  After that, Secret Service agents bust the school dance and retrieve Luke. Simms is fired and not allowed to speak with Luke, who is crushed that his friend has apparently "abandoned" him. Luke, under house arrest and with a [[homing device]] attached to him, receives advice from an online friend, Mongoose12, on how to escape the [[White House]] and meet him at a local mall. Luke agrees, but it is revealed that Mongoose12 was in fact former agent Woods, who abducts him. When Luke goes missing, Simms is given another chance to protect him. With the help of his friend Harold (who owns a spy shop), he quickly tracks Luke to the mall.   In a standoff, Woods says he was originally planning on returning Luke to the President so he could be a hero and get his job back, but now he wants to kill him instead. He blames Luke for making him lose his job, and even his wife. Woods tries to shoot Simms, but he takes cover and once Woods is out of bullets, Simms brings him down with a right [[uppercut]]. As other agents arrive, Woods tries to shoot Luke with a back-up revolver but Simms jumps in front of Luke, causing him to take the intended bullet in his arm. Woods is also shot, subdued, and arrested by other arriving Secret Service agents for abduction, assault, and attempted murder.  In the final scene of the film, Simms is offered Presidential duty which he declines in order to stay with Luke full time, so he can also spend more time Luke's biology teacher, with whom he has formed a romantic relationship with. Luke is relieved of his last punishment, and while playing street hockey with friends, hits in Simms in the forehead with the puck, resulting a chase-off between Simms and Luke.  
Fire (1996 film)
 The film opens with young Radha sitting in a mustard field with her parents. Her mother tells her a tale of a person who wanted to see the ocean, but Radha says that she does not understand the moral of the story.  The film flashes forward to Sita, a newly married woman on honeymoon with her husband Jatin, who is distant and shows little interest in Sita. Jatin is in a typical joint-family arrangement - he lives with his older brother Ashok, his sister-in-law Radha, his paralysed mother Biji and the family servant Mundu. Ashok and Jatin run a small store that sells food and rents videotapes.  Jatin shows no care for Sita, and she learns that he only agreed to the arranged marriage in order to put an end to Ashok's nagging. Jatin continues to date his modern Chinese girlfriend, and Sita does not rebuke him. The rest of Jatin's home is not rosy either. Biji is immobile and speechless after a stroke, and Sita and Radha must constantly attend to her. Sita spends her days slaving in the hot kitchen, and finds herself lonely and frustrated at night because Jatin is out with his girlfriend. She yearns to break out of this stifling situation.  It is revealed that Radha faces a similar problem. Many years ago, Ashok had come under the influence of Swamiji, a local religious preacher, who teaches that desires are the cause of suffering and must be suppressed. Ashok is completely taken by these monastic teachings and suppresses all his desires. He also donates large sums from the meager store income to treat the Swamiji's [[hydrocele]] condition. The Swamiji teaches that sexual contact is permitted only as a means for procreation, and Radha is infertile. Accordingly, Ashok aims to stamp out all his desires and has not slept with Radha for the past thirteen years. He puts Radha through an excruciating ritual in which they lie motionless next to each other whenever he wants to test his resolve. Radha is racked with guilt over her inability to have children and driven to frustration by the ritual.   While the older Radha remains bound by tradition and subdued into silence, the younger Sita refuses to accept her fate. Sita's attitude slowly spills over onto Radha, who becomes slightly more assertive. One evening, shunned by their husbands and driven to desperation by their unfulfilled longings, Radha and Sita seek solace in each other and become lovers. Overjoyed at finding satisfaction in this manner, they continue it in secret. They eventually realise their love for each other and start looking for ways to move out. The pair's daily antics and adventures are witnessed by Biji, who disapproves, but is unable to stop them. After some time, Mundu becomes aware of their relationship, and he causes Ashok to walk in on Radha and Sita.  Ashok is horrified. He is also shattered when he finds this incident has stoked his own long-dormant desire. Sita decides to pack her belongings and leave the house immediately, while Radha stays behind in order to talk to her husband. The women promise to meet each other later that night. Ashok confronts Radha, who overcomes her subservience and pours out her emotions. Amid this argument, Radha's sari catches fire, and Ashok angrily watches her burn without helping. Radha puts out the flames and recalls her mother's advice from when she was young - she can finally see her ocean.   An injured Radha leaves Ashok, moving out in order to join Sita.  
Fever Lake
  A group of teenagers visit a lake with intentions to spend the weekend there. Despite warnings from the locals, the group continues with their weekend plan and soon discover the lake is cursed.  
Fine Powder
 The film tells of Thomas (Facundo Luengo) a Jewish grown man who lives with his grandmother in the industrial section of a large Argentine city.  His life isn't going exactly as planned. Though he has impregnated his girlfriend Ana, he finds himself avoiding her because he has fallen in love with Alma, so he ignores Ana.  When he needs to make some money, he hooks up with a drug dealer, and this makes matters worse.  
Fireman Sam In Action
 The video is made up of three separate stories. They are essentially live action adaptations of stories from the animated series, with a few significant changes. Penny Morris appears in all three stories, though she only appeared in one episode in the show. Also, each story includes a subplot which was not in the series - Elvis being sacked as Fire Station cook, the training film, and Norman's pet hedgehog were all created for the stage play. Bella Lasagna is not introduced until the second story, because Bentley the Robot is played by the same actress.  === Fire Station Flood Alert === Station Officer Steele fires Elvis Cridlington as the station cook. This gives Fireman Sam an idea; He invents Pancake Prototype One and a robot called Bentley to be Elvis’ replacement ("Gently, Bentley"). Whilst spring-cleaning, Elvis, exasperated with Bentley's constant whistling, decides to place his [[Elvis Presley]] cassette into the robot. This causes Bentley to malfunction and ends up breaking the stopcock, causing a flood inside the fire station. When it’s all sorted, the crew start having what Bentley has cooked, bangers and mash. It turns out that Bentley isn’t a good replacement, and everyone decides Elvis should be reappointed ("Elvis Cooks The Lunch").  === Dilys’ Attic Fire === A few weeks later, the fire station crew set to work on a training film with Norman Price as Trevor’s "gopher". Production of the training film begins. Norman gets bored of being a gopher, so Penny suggests he play a victim in their staged rescue, along with Sam's niece and nephew Sarah and James. Later, Dilys Price looks for treasure in her attic after reading a magazine article, but the candle she uses for light starts a fire in the house. When she’s getting rescued, she argues about not letting go of a valuable vase that she found and could be in danger of breaking, and it ends up in Trevor’s hands. Dilys lavishly praises the fire brigade, but they say it's all in a day's work ("By Jupiter, By Jupiter").  === Pontypandy Fireworks Party === On November 5th, the crew are preparing a bonfire for [[Guy Fawkes Night|Bonfire Night]], under the command of Station Officer Steele ("The Person In Charge Is Station Officer Steele"). Norman is dressed as a tree and pinches Bella and Dilys’ bottoms. His plan is foiled by some railings, in which he ends up getting stuck. After the crew rescue him from the railings, Norman introduces his pet [[hedgehog]], which he calls Brian. Brian scampers into the bonfire and Norman panics to get him out. The crew set up the guy and light the bonfire, but Norman, who is searching for Brian, is in danger of being killed. After he’s rescued, it’s revealed that Brian was a female hedgehog and had just had babies. Sam renames the hedgehog Blodwyn, but advises Norman to let the hedgehogs off into their natural habitat. Trevor and Elvis light the bonfire, and the celebrations are underway ("Remember, Remember The Fifth of November").  
Fly Away Home
 After her mother Aliane dies in a car accident, 13-year-old Amy Alden ([[Anna Paquin]]) is brought from [[New Zealand]] to [[Ontario]], Canada, by her estranged father Thomas Alden ([[Jeff Daniels]]), a sculptor and inventor, to live with him and his girlfriend Susan ([[Dana Delany]]).  When a construction crew destroys a small wilderness area near the Alden home, Amy finds a nest of [[Canada geese|goose]] eggs. Without Thomas, Susan, or her uncle David ([[Terry Kinney]]) knowing, she takes the eggs and keeps them in a dresser in her father’s old barn to [[Avian incubation|incubate]]. When the eggs have hatched, she is allowed to keep the goslings as pets. Thomas asks for help from local game warden Glen Seifert ([[Jeremy Ratchford]]) on how to care for the geese. Seifert comes over to the Alden house, and explains that the geese have [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinted]] on Amy as their mother. He explains that geese learn everything from their parents including migratory routes, but also warns Thomas that all [[domesticated animals|domestic]] geese must have their wings [[pinioning|pinioned]] (clipped) to render them flightless, which upsets Amy. Thomas throws Seifert off his property, only for Seifert to threaten the Aldens that if the birds start flying, he will have to confiscate them.  Thomas decides to use an [[ultralight]] aircraft to teach the birds to fly and show them their migratory routes, but quickly realizes the birds will only follow Amy. Aided by his friend Barry ([[Holter Graham]]), Thomas teaches Amy how to fly an ultralight aircraft of her own, so she can teach the geese. David mentions knowing someone running a [[bird sanctuary]] in [[North Carolina]], and arranges for the geese to go to the sanctuary. The birds have to arrive before November 1, or the sanctuary will be torn down by developers who plan to turn it into a coastal housing development.  [[File:ThomasAlden-FlyAwayHome.jpg|Thomas ([[Jeff Daniels]]) attempts to get the geese to follow him.|250px|left|thumb]]  Amy and Thomas practice flying the aircraft, but Igor, the weakest of the geese, who has a limp, accidentally hits the front of Amy’s aircraft and lands in an isolated forest. While the group goes off to search for the bird, Glen Seifert returns to the Alden farm and confiscates the other geese. The next day, an elaborate plan is staged to free the geese and start their migration to North Carolina.  Making an emergency landing at [[Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station]] in western  New York on the south shore of Lake Ontario, Amy and Thomas almost get arrested. They become national news, with residents cheering them on and offering the two a place to stay at night at each of their stops. Thirty miles before reaching the bird sanctuary, Thomas’s aircraft suffers a structural failure and crashes in a cornfield; he tells Amy to finish the journey by herself. After Amy takes off and begins to head toward the sanctuary, Thomas hitchhikes to the bird sanctuary. While waiting for the geese, Thomas, Susan, David, Barry and many animal enthusiasts stand up to developers who are waiting to start the excavation of the site.  Amy eventually appears with the geese, much to the joy of the townspeople and Amy’s family, but to the dismay of the developers. The townspeople and the Aldens celebrate their victory. The following spring, all 16 geese safely return to the Aldens' farm on their own.  
Flirting with Disaster (film)
 Mel Coplin and his wife, Nancy, live in New York, near Mel's neurotic, Jewish, adoptive parents, Ed and Pearl Coplin.  Mel and Nancy have just had their first child, and Mel won't decide on a name for their son until he can discover the identity of his biological parents.  After an adoption agency employee locates his biological mother's name in a [[database]], Mel decides to meet her personally.  Tina, the sexy but highly incompetent adoption agency employee, decides to accompany Mel, Nancy, and the newborn on a trip to San Diego to meet Mel's biological mother.  The trip, of course, does not go as planned, and ends up becoming a tour of the United States.  First, Mel is introduced to Valerie, a blond Scandinavian woman with Confederate roots whose twin daughters are at least six inches taller than Mel. They quickly realize that Valerie is not Mel's biological mother, and Tina scrambles to get the correct information from the agency database. Meanwhile, Nancy becomes jealous as Tina and Mel begin to flirt.  Next, the group heads to Battle Creek, Michigan with the hope of meeting the man whose name appears as the person who delivered infant Mel to the adoption agency. The man, Fritz Boudreau, turns out to be a trucker with a violent streak. However, when he discovers that Mel might be his son, he becomes instantly friendly and lets Mel drive his [[semi-trailer truck]], which Mel immediately crashes into a Post Office building.  This leads to a run-in with two [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms|ATF]] agents, Tony and Paul, who are [[homosexuality|gay]] and in a relationship with each other. It is discovered that Tony and Nancy went to high school together. Charges are dismissed, and Fritz Boudreau tells Mel that he is not Mel's father, but only handled Mel's adoption because Mel's biological parents were indisposed.  Tina locates the current address of Mel's biological parents, which turns out to be in rural New Mexico. Tony and Paul surprise everyone by deciding to tag along on the trip.  While Mel and Tina become close, Nancy finds herself [[flirting]] with Tony, who returns the compliment, causing friction. The trip through rural New Mexico is fraught with more problems. At last the whole crowd descends on the front porch of Mel's true biological parents, Richard and Mary Schlichting. They are asked to stay the night. While Richard and Mary are more than welcoming, Mel's biological brother Lonnie is overly rude and jealous. It is during dinner that Mel discovers that Richard and Mary had to let Mel be [[adoption|adopted]] because they were in jail for making and distributing [[LSD]] in the late 1960s.  Not only that, but Richard and Mary continue to manufacture [[LSD]], as becomes apparent when Lonnie, in an attempt to dose Mel with acid at dinner, accidentally doses Paul, the ATF agent.  In his drugged state Paul tries to arrest Richard and Mary but Lonnie knocks him out with a frying pan. They attempt to escape and decide to take Mel's car, hiding their supply of acid in the trunk. Mel's adoptive parents arrive but then change their minds and decide to leave, taking the wrong car. When they change their minds again and make a blind U-turn, the two families crash. Mel's adoptive parents are arrested while his biological parents escape to Mexico.   Not realizing what has happened Mel recounts the stories from dinner to Nancy and they agree to name the baby [[Jerry Garcia|Garcia]]. The next day Paul explains the situation and is able to get Mel's parents released, and they are happy and reassured to hear Mel call them his parents. A montage of their relationships continues over the credits. They all still have their troubles but Mel and Nancy are happy together.  
Flipper (1996 film)
 Sandy Ricks is sent off for the summer to stay with his Uncle Porter in the seaside town of Coral Key. Initially, Sandy is unenthusiastic and disappointed that he isn't going to a [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] concert. His mood remains unchanged even after meeting Kathy, a local shopkeeper with whom his uncle carries on a flirtatious relationship, and Kim, a girl his own age.  While out on Porter's fishing trawler, they meet Porter's enemy, Dirk Moran. Nearby, a [[Dolphin#Social behavior|pod]] of dolphins is frolicking near Dirks boat. As a big game fisherman, Dirk Moran makes it plain that he hates just about every other fish-eating animal on earth. Sandy meets a dolphin, Flipper.  The next morning, Porter and Sandy are paid a visit by the sheriff, who explains that they could not keep the dolphin unless he is in captivity. That night, Sandy and Kim set out on a [[dinghy]] to look for Flipper. They fail to locate the dolphin, but see dumping of barrels off of Dirk Moran's boat. The next morning, as Kim arrives looking for Sandy, Sonny, Porter's pet brown pelican, comes running, as if asking her to follow him. Sonny leads Kim to Flipper who is beached on the shore and sick. They manage to cure Flipper anyhow.  Kathy determines that Flipper has been poisoned by toxic waste, which is also shown to have been ruining the local fishing. The group uses Flipper's ability of [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] and a special camera attached to his head to help them locate the barrels of toxic waste. Flipper also manages to locate the rest of his pod, and reunites with them, in the process, dropping the camera. Porter rushes back to alert the sheriff about the barrels. Sandy, however becomes concerned that something has happened to Flipper, without informing anyone except Kathy's young son, Marvin, who sets off in the dinghy to find him.  Sandy barely survives an encounter with Dirk Moran's boat, which dismantles the dinghy. He sees an approaching [[dorsal fin]] and thinks it is Flipper, but it is actually Scar, a [[hammerhead shark]] that has been lurking in the island's waters. Sandy swims for his life towards Dirk's boat. As Scar is about to attack Sandy, Flipper appears and starts nose-butting him in the gills. There is a harrowing moment when Scar proves stronger than Flipper, but Flipper's dolphin pod comes to his aid in the nick of time. Dirk Moran is arrested by the sheriff for illegally dumping toxic waste.  The next morning, when Sandy's mom and younger sibling arrive to pick him up, there is a commotion. It is Flipper, who has come to see Sandy off.  
The First Wives Club
 At [[Middlebury College]] in 1969, four young friends, Annie MacDuggan, Elise Elliot, Brenda Morelli, and Cynthia Swann, are graduating. Excited for the future and the potential it holds, the girls enthusiastically make a champagne toast celebrating their graduation as well as their friendship. As graduation gifts, valedictorian Cynthia presents the girls with matching [[Bulgari]] pearl necklaces. As the graduates take a commemorative picture of the four of them (presumably for the last time), Cynthia makes Annie, Brenda and Elise promise that they will always be there for each other throughout the remainder of their lives.  In the present time, the four friends eventually lose touch with one another, as evident when Cynthia ([[Stockard Channing]]) is tearfully gazing at the picture of the four of them on that graduation day. Now wealthy and living in a luxurious penthouse, she gives her maid her own [[Bulgari]] [[pearl]] necklace (matching the three she gave to her friends on graduation day), and has the maid mail letters to them. She later walks outside of the balcony of her penthouse in a floor length fur coat, a cigarette and a drink, and then commits suicide by jumping to her death after learning through the tabloids that her ex-husband Gil (whom Cynthia made wealthy through her connections, according to narrator Annie) married his much younger [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] the day before.  Cynthia's suicide is subsequently splashed all over the news. The surviving three former friends, shocked by the tragic event, all attend her funeral. After the funeral, the three friends reconnect over a long lunch to catch-up on their lives post-graduation. As it turns out, Cynthia's former friends aren't doing much better. Annie ([[Diane Keaton]]) is separated, suffering extreme self-esteem issues, and going through therapy with her husband. Brenda ([[Bette Midler]]) is divorced, left for a younger woman, depressed, and struggling financially. Elise ([[Goldie Hawn]]), whose husband also left her for a younger woman, is now an aging alcoholic movie actress who has become a plastic-surgery addict to keep her career afloat.  Shortly after Cynthia's funeral, at which the three remaining friends are reunited for the first time since college, Annie's husband, Aaron ([[Stephen Collins]]), leaves her for her younger therapist ([[Marcia Gay Harden]]) and asks her for a divorce after spending a night together (and leading Annie to believe it would reconcile them); Brenda has a rather unpleasant encounter at a clothing store with her ex, Morty ([[Dan Hedaya]]) and his younger and rather hateful mistress Shelly ([[Sarah Jessica Parker]]), and Elise finds out that her soon-to be ex-husband, Bill ([[Victor Garber]]), is requesting alimony and half of their marital assets claiming that Elise owes her fame to him. Also, during a meeting with a director for a possible leading lady movie role, she discovers that she is only to play the lead female's mother; she later learns the lead female is Bill's current girlfriend.  Shortly thereafter, the three friends receive the letters that Cynthia mailed to them before her suicide. After each one reads her letter from Cynthia, and feeling that they have been taken for granted by their husbands, the women decide to create the First Wives Club, aiming to get revenge on their exes. Annie's lesbian daughter Chris ([[Jennifer Dundas]]) also gets in on the plan by asking for a job at her father's advertising agency so she can supply her mother with inside information, as [[Revenge|payback]] for Aaron's unfairness toward Annie.  Brenda finds out through her uncle Carmine ([[Philip Bosco]]), who has Mafia connections, that Morty is guilty of income tax fraud, while Annie makes a plan to revive her advertising career and buy out Aaron's partners. Elise starts to liquidate all of the marital assets her and Bill collected during their marriage, agreeing to split the proceeds of the liquidation between the two of them. However, as their plan moves through, things start to fall apart when they find out that Bill has no checkered past and nothing for them to use against him. Elise, feeling sorry for herself, gets drunk, which only results in her and Brenda hurling vicious insults at each other, and the women drift apart. When Annie starts thinking about closing down the First Wives Club, her friends come back, saying that they want to see this to the end, and Bill hasn't done anything blatantly wrong, but only as far as he knows. As a result, the wives manage to uncover information revealing that Bill's mistress ([[Elizabeth Berkley]]) is actually a [[Minor (law)|minor]].  Deciding that revenge would make them no better than their husbands, they instead use these situations to push their men into funding the establishment of a [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to aiding abused women, in memory of their college friend Cynthia. The film ends with a celebration at the new Cynthia Swann Griffin Crisis Center for Women. Elise starts a relationship with a cast member in her play, Brenda and Morty reconcile and Annie rebuffs Aaron's attempt to get back together with him. While outside the center Bill meets Shelly and the two start to flirt. The film concludes with the three women joyfully singing "[[You Don't Own Me]]".

Flame (1996 film)
 In 1975, Florence, an impulsive young peasant girl from the [[Mashonaland]] countryside, decides to run away and join the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU) after her father is detained by the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]]. She and her friend Nyasha subsequently brave the dangers of the African bush on a long trek to a refugee camp in neighbouring [[Mozambique]], where they are trained as militants by ZANU's insurgent wing, ZANLA. Both adopt new revolutionary identities: Nyasha becomes ''Liberty'', representing her desire for self-sufficiency, while Florence brands herself ''Flame'', representing passion.  Life in the Mozambican refugee camps is hard: Flame and Liberty must learn to deal with the hardship and constant dangers of insurgent life. To complicate matters, some unscrupulous male guerrillas - such as Comrade Che, a ZANLA [[political commissar]], assume that female members of the party would be available to satisfy their sexual desires. When Flame rejects his advances, Che rapes and impregnates her with his child.  Although naturally devastated, Flame reconciles with Che and is shattered when he and their son are killed by a Rhodesian [[air strike]]. Determining she has nothing to live for but the conflict, Flame goes on to distinguish herself during ZANLA raids on farms and infrastructure. [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980|Zimbabwean independence]] in the 1980s proves bittersweet for Flame, who finds it difficult adjusting to civilian life. Under [[Robert Mugabe]]'s new government, rural unemployment is rising, thousands continue to migrate to urban areas in search of work, and many ZANLA veterans - including Flame's new husband - feel disillusioned or ignored. Flame relocates to [[Harare]], where Liberty has used her background as an [[intelligence officer]] to secure a lucrative administrative post, although their reunion is short-lived: Flame wants assistance but Liberty no longer believes in the [[Collectivism|collectivist]] principles of mutual support and shared purpose once preached by ZANU during the bush war.  The two acquaintances finally attend a [[Heroes' Day]] party, nearly fifteen years after their struggle against white Rhodesia began, in an increasingly authoritarian Zimbabwe. They continue to greet passerby with the old [[Pan-Africanism|pan-Africa]]n slogan, ''"[[A luta continua]]"'' ("the struggle continues") as the film closes.

Forest Warrior
 The film opens with a campfire story being told by Clovis Madison ([[Roscoe Lee Browne]]) to a group of children, about a man named Jebidiah McKenna ([[Chuck Norris]]) who was killed a century ago in the Tanglewood forest while fighting bandits. McKenna was magically brought back to life...and given the power to transform into a bear, wolf, or eagle. Inspired by this tale, the children dub their group the Lords of the Tanglewood - complete with the following pledge: "We ask you to leave it pure as found; For we are to it forever bound."   During the present day, the Tanglewood forest is targeted for harvesting by a logging conglomerate directed by villainous lumber magnate Travis Thorne ([[Terry Kiser]]). Most of the small town is against their deforestation...including the kids, who regularly camp out in a treehouse in the woods. During one of their trips, a group of loggers bully the kids - only to get beaten up by McKenna, the legendary shapeshifter, who also happens to be a master of [[Native American martial arts]]. The loggers report this to Thorne, who orders the treehouse destroyed. While the kids are gone the loggers place a bomb in the treehouse...unaware that the Tanglewood Lords' leader - and sole female member - Austene Slaighter ([[Megan Paul]]) is still there. McKenna beats up the loggers again, then uses the forest's magic to resurrect her just like he had been.  Austene is reunited with her widowed father Arlen ([[Michael Beck]]) - once the town's deputy sheriff, but now its token drunk. Meanwhile, Thorne obtains a permit to continue logging. The Lords of the Tanglewood rally in response to this; they prank the loggers with numerous boobytraps, impeding Thorne's efforts to chop down the forest. They also play rock music on a ghetto-blaster, which causes the loggers to dance around idiotically. (One of them even [[air guitar]]s with a chainsaw!) Finally, McKenna appears before Thorne and intimidates him by turning into a bear; the terrified villain calls off the deforestation, and confesses all of his wrongdoing to the authorities. With their forest saved, the townspeople rebuild the kids' treehouse...while Austene sees McKenna's spirit reunited with that of his Native American wife.  
Forgotten Sins
   
For Ever Mozart
 The film is divided into four parts, which Godard has subsequently given by name.   === Theater === In the first part, Vicky Vitalis, an elderly film director, is casting a new project called "Fatal Bolero," assisted by his nephew, Jérôme. A group of actors lines up to audition, but Vicky is dissatisfied with each of their line readings. The director nevertheless manages to secure funding from a man called Baron Felix, who himself secures one of the actresses named Sabine, to the chagrin of Sabine's plaintive boyfriend. Later, Jérôme accompanies Vicky's daughter, Camille, a professor of philosophy, as she searches for a copy of ''[[The Game of Love and Chance]]'', the play by [[Pierre de Marivaux]]. Her intention is to stage the play in [[Bosnian War|war torn Sarajevo]]. However, unable to find a copy, she settles instead on the [[Alfred de Musset]] play ''One Must Not Trifle with Love'', happily noting that she shares the same name as the play's heroine.  Jérôme, smitten with his cousin, decides to go to Sarajevo with her, to his mother Sylvie's dismay. Sylvie persuades her brother Vicky to accompany them, and the family's maid, Jamila, also decides to go. Camille and Jérôme decide to cast Jamila in the play as the character Rosette.  === One Must Not Trifle with Love in Sarajevo === In the second part, the four take a train to [[Bosnia]] and rough it in the wild. Increasingly unable to share in his young charges' idealism, Vicky abandons them, filling the role of a West European who turns his back on the horrors of the Bosnian war. The spectre of tanks begins to appear in the forest, and not long after, Camille, Jérôme, and Jamila are captured by Serbian paramilitaries and taken to a derelict mansion the paramilitaries are using as a base. There, Camille and Jérôme metaphorically dig their own graves when they correct a Serbian commander on his account of [[Georges Danton]]'s participation in the [[French Revolution]]. After being anally violated, they are forced to literally dig their own graves, and are killed in an ensuing attack on the base. Jamila, a soldier having taken a liking to her, escapes.  === The Film of Disquiet === The third part sees Vicky working on "Fatal Bolero" by the seaside. Baron Felix, the film's financier, holds court at a nearby casino. There the former actress Sabine, now the Baron's dutiful assistant, transcribes the dialogue of an anally fixated porn film while the Baron doles out money for Vicky's film. On the beach, Vicky arranges an unnamed Actress and Actor on the sand in imitation of Camille's and Jérôme's deaths. Later, he relentlessly shoots take after take of the Actress as she tries to articulate her lines – statements once spoken by Camille – amid a torrent of wind and rain. The elderly director eventually instructs the young Actress to shout simply, "yes." The scene shifts to the film's debut at a small theater. The people lining up don't even make it inside. Realizing that it is an art film shot in black and white, depicting the horrors of war, and not the least bit prurient, they wander off in disgust to see something called "Terminator 4," while the theater owner hurriedly removes the posters for the film. Sabine's ex-boyfriend arrives and declares to Baron Felix that "justice has been served."  === For Ever Mozart === In the fourth and final movement, a group of people files into an ornate hall to attend a [[Mozart]] piano concerto performed by a youth orchestra. The performance is unable to begin until the pianist, an effete young man in period garb, secures one of the set runners from "Fatal Bolero" as a page turner. As the performance commences, a fatigued Vicky keeps time to the music in the hallway, unable to make it past the top of the stairs. Inside, the music plays on, and the pages, showing Mozart's carefully crafted notation, keep turning.  
For the Moment (film)
 In the summer of 1942, something is dramatically changing for the small community of [[Brandon, Manitoba]] as hundreds of young men from all over the world descend on this sleepy hamlet. In this newly found excitement of meeting newcomers, Lill (Christianne Hirt), a young prairie farm wife whose husband is already overseas for two years, and [[Leading aircraftman|LAC]] Lachlan Curry (Russell Crowe), a gallant Australian airman are fated to meet. He has come to train at the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] air base nearby to become a pilot. His friend, LAC Johnny Crouch (Peter Outerbridge) who has struck up a relationship with Lill's younger sister, Kate (Sara McMillan), introduces Lachlan to Lill.  During a languid moment, Lachlan recites to Lill the poem, "High Flight" by fellow airman, [[John Gillespie Magee, Jr.]] which epitomizes what he is going through in his training. Lill recognizes the poem as it had been widely distributed after the death of the young airman who had penned it. The young lovers also have a kinship with another unlikely pairing, Betsy (Wanda Cannon), a bootlegging charmer who sells more than alcohol and also has a husband away in the army and two children to look after, and Zeek Williams (Scott Kraft), the flying station's chief flight instructor from Chicago.  The short period that they have together is punctuated by the strain of dangerous wartime training and their inevitable realization that there is little time left for them. Lachlan has to deal with death from all sides, first when "Scotty" (Robert G. Slade), the trainee who bunks next to him, commits suicide. More devastating is the death of Lill's brother, Dennis (Kelly Proctor) that leads her to a fateful decision to end their relationship, and her sister to cancel wedding plans. When Zeek crashes on the edge of the field, he extracts a cruel promise from Lachlan who later seeks out Betsy to tell her what he had to do. At the wings parade, a farewell to the trainees who have earned their wings who will be shortly sent off to war, Lachlan and Lill are unable to reconcile, but Kate remains true to Johnny, saying she will be there when he comes back. Across the parade square, Lachlan and Lill share a final moment, saying goodbye quietly, with a phrase he has taught her, "Fair dinkum."   
From Dusk till Dawn
 Fugitive bank robbers Seth and Richie Gecko hold up and destroy a liquor store, killing the clerk and a Texas ranger. At the motel room where they are hiding out, Seth returns to find Richie has raped and murdered a bank clerk they had taken hostage.  Jacob Fuller, a pastor experiencing a crisis of faith, is on vacation with his teenage children Scott and Kate in their RV. They stop at the motel and are kidnapped by the Geckos, who force the Fullers to smuggle them over the [[Mexican border]]. In Mexico, they arrive at the Titty Twister, a [[strip club]] in the desert, where the Geckos will be met by their contact, Carlos, at dawn. Carlos will escort them to sanctuary at "El Rey," a place of safety for fugitives from justice whose admission fee is 30 percent of everything they have.  The bar employees reveal themselves as [[vampire]]s and kill most of the patrons. Richie is bitten by a stripper and dies; only Seth, Jacob, Kate, Scott, a biker named Sex Machine, and Frost, a [[Vietnam veteran]], survive. The others are reborn as vampires, including Richie, forcing the survivors to kill them all. When an army of vampires assembles outside, the survivors lock themselves in, but Sex Machine is bitten, becomes a vampire, and bites Frost and Jacob. Frost throws Sex Machine through the door, allowing the vampires to enter.  Seth and the Fullers escape to a storeroom and fashion weapons from truck cargo the vampires have looted from past victims, including a stake mounted on a [[Drill|pneumatic drill]], a [[crossbow]], a [[shotgun]], and [[holy water]], which requires Jacob to recover his faith to bless. Jacob, knowing he will soon become a vampire, makes Scott and Kate promise to kill him when he changes.  The group make their final assault on the undead. Jacob becomes a vampire, but Scott hesitates to kill him, allowing Jacob to bite him. Scott hits Jacob with holy water and shoots him. Scott is overwhelmed by vampires, who begin to devour him; he begs for death, and Kate shoots him. As vampires surround Kate and Seth, streams of morning light enter through bullet holes in the building, making the vampires back away. Carlos's bodyguards blast the door open, letting in the sunlight and killing the vampires.  Seth chastises Carlos for his poor choice of meeting place and negotiates a smaller tribute for his admission to El Rey. Kate asks Seth if she can go with him to El Rey, but he refuses, leaving her with some cash. Kate drives away in the RV, leaving the Titty Twister — in fact the top of a partially buried [[Aztec]] temple — behind.  
The Frighteners
  In 1990, architect Frank Bannister's wife, Debra, dies in a car accident. He abandons his profession and his unfinished "dream house" sits incomplete. Following the accident, Frank gained the power to see ghosts and befriends three: 1970s street gangster Cyrus, 1950s nerd Stuart, and The Judge, a [[Gunfighter|gunslinger]] from [[American frontier|the Old West]]. The ghosts haunt houses so Frank can then "[[exorcism|exorcise]]" them for a fee. Most locals consider him a [[Confidence trick|con man]].  Soon after Frank cons local health nut Ray Lynskey and his wife Lucy, a physician, Ray dies of a heart attack. Frank discovers there is an entity, appearing as the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], killing people, first marking numbers on their foreheads that only Frank sees. Debra had a similar number when she was found.  Frank's ability to foretell the murders puts him under suspicion with the police and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Milton Dammers, who is convinced Frank is responsible. Frank is arrested for killing newspaper editor Magda Rees-Jones, who had attacked him in the press. It was actually the Grim Reaper who killed Rees-Jones, despite Frank's attempts to prevent it.  Lucy investigates the murders and becomes a target of the Grim Reaper. She is attacked while visiting Frank in jail; but they escape with the help of Cyrus and Stuart, who are both dissolved in the process. Frank wants to commit suicide to stop the Grim Reaper. Lucy helps Frank have a near-death experience by putting him into [[hypothermia]] and using [[barbiturate]]s to stop his heart. Dammers abducts Lucy, revealing that he had been a victim of [[Charles Manson]] and [[Spahn Ranch#The Manson Family|his "Family" in 1969]].  In his ghostly form, Frank confronts the Grim Reaper and discovers that he is the ghost of Johnny Bartlett, a psychiatric hospital orderly who killed twelve people 30 years earlier, before being captured, convicted and executed. Newspaper reports reveal that his greatest desire was to become the most prolific serial killer ever, showing pride at killing more than contemporaries like [[Charles Starkweather]]. Patricia Bradley, then a teenager, was accused as his accomplice, although she escaped the death penalty due to her underage status. Lucy resuscitates Frank and they visit Patricia. Unknown to them, Patricia is still in love with Bartlett and on friendly, homicidal terms with Bartlett's ghost, and eventually kills her own mother, who had been trying to monitor her daughter's behavior. Lucy and Frank trap Bartlett's spirit in his urn, which Patricia has kept. The pair make for the chapel of the now-abandoned psychiatric hospital hoping to send Bartlett's ghost to [[Hell]].  Patricia and Dammers chase them through the ruins. Dammers throws the ashes away, releasing Bartlett's ghost again before Patricia kills Dammers. Bartlett's ghost and Patricia hunt down Frank and Lucy. Frank realizes that Bartlett's ghost, with Patricia's help, was responsible for his wife's death and the number on her brow, and that he is still trying to add to his body count (and infamy) even after his death.  Out of bullets, Patricia strangles Frank to death, but Frank in spirit form rips Patricia's spirit from her body, forcing Bartlett to follow them. Bartlett grabs Patricia's ghost, while Frank makes it to Heaven, where he is reunited with Cyrus and Stuart, along with his wife Debra. Bartlett and Patricia's spirits claim they will now go back to claim more lives, but the portal to Heaven quickly changes to a demonic-looking appearance and they are both dragged to Hell by a giant worm-like creature. Frank learns it is not yet his time and is sent back to his body as Debra's spirit tells him to "be happy."  Frank and Lucy fall in love. Lucy is now able to see ghosts as well. Frank later begins demolishing the unfinished dream house and building a life with Lucy while the morose-looking ghost of Dammers is riding around in the sheriff's car. Frank and Lucy then enjoy their picnic.  
Freeway (1996 film)
 Vanessa Lutz is a poor, illiterate, though not ignorant, teenage girl living south of Los Angeles. Her mother, Ramona, is arrested in a [[prostitution]] sting and her stepfather, Larry, is taken into custody on drug and child abuse charges. Social worker Mrs. Sheets comes to take Vanessa away, but Vanessa handcuffs her ankle to a bed and runs away. She takes her parents' run-down car and plans to go to her grandmother in [[Stockton, California|Stockton]]. Along the way, Vanessa stops to see her boyfriend Chopper Wood, a local gang member, to tell him about her trip and he gives her a gun to sell upon arriving at her destination. Minutes after Vanessa leaves, Chopper is killed in a drive-by shooting by rival gang members. Later, Bob Wolverton, a counselor at a school for boys with emotional trouble, picks her up after her car breaks down and offers to take her as far as Los Angeles where he is headed.  Over the long drive, Vanessa comes to trust Bob, and confesses to him the details of her painfully dysfunctional life, including being sexually abused by her stepfather. At one point, Vanessa shows Bob a photo she keeps in her wallet of her biological father. That evening, Bob reveals he is a serial killer of young girls – known in the press as the "I-5 Killer". He tries to kill Vanessa when she refuses to give in to him. The tables are turned, however, as Vanessa eventually pulls out her gun and shoots him several times before escaping. She goes to a local restaurant where her blood-stained appearance attracts attention from the patrons and staff.  After leaving the restaurant, Vanessa is quickly arrested and questioned by two police detectives, Mike Breer and Garnet Wallace, who write her off as a carjacker, even though she insists Bob had tried to kill her and had told her about his other murders.  Bob has survived, but the bullet wounds have left him severely handicapped and disfigured. Vanessa is put on trial, with everyone believing that Bob is the innocent victim he claims to be since he has no criminal record, while Vanessa has a long record and is a veteran of juvenile homes. Vanessa goes to prison, while Bob and his socialite wife Mimi, who knows nothing of his crimes, are treated like heroes.  Scared at first, Vanessa eventually makes friends in prison, including a heroin-addicted lesbian named Rhonda and a brutal [[Hispanic]] gang leader named Mesquita. Undaunted, Vanessa plots to escape and continue her journey to visit her grandmother. Remembering what her stepfather taught her about life in prison, Vanessa constructs a crude knife from a toothbrush as a weapon. The following evening, Vanessa and Mesquita are being transferred to a new maximum security prison. En route, Mesquita and Vanessa subdue and escape from the prison guards assigned to escort them, with Mesquita killing one. After their escape, Vanessa and Mesquita part ways as Mesquita goes off to be reunited with her gang, and Vanessa continues her journey to her grandmother's house.  Meanwhile, detectives Breer and Wallace re-examine evidence found at the scene of Bob's shooting and begin to suspect that Vanessa was telling the truth. They then search Bob's home, where they find violent child pornography in the locked shed adjacent to the house. Confronted at last with what her husband really is, Mimi commits suicide. Arriving home at just that moment to find police cars outside his house, Bob panics and flees to Vanessa's grandmother's house. He finds the address to the grandmother's trailer park written on the back of a photograph Vanessa had on her.  Posing as a prostitute, Vanessa steals a car from a prospective john and drives to her grandmother's house. Vanessa finds Bob in bed wearing her grandmother's nightgown and nightcap with the covers pulled up to his nose. Bob reveals himself and Vanessa sees her grandmother's body on the floor. A struggle ensues, culminating in Vanessa strangling Bob. Detectives Breer and Wallace arrive and approach the trailer with their guns drawn when they hear the commotion inside. Vanessa eventually exits the trailer exhausted after her struggle and the detectives enter to find Bob and Vanessa's grandmother both dead. Outside, Vanessa sits in a chair, near her breaking point, when she looks up and asks the detectives if they have a cigarette. They smile and Vanessa responds in kind.  
Foxfire (1996 film)
 Maddie Wirtz is a high school senior living in the suburbs of [[Portland, Oregon]]. Her plans to coast through her last school year before college are waylaid when she meets another teenage girl who's a drifter, "Legs," who takes shelter from the rain inside her school. The same day she meets them, Legs convinces Maddie and fellow students Rita Faldes and Violet Kahn to confront Mr. Buttinger, a teacher who's been sexually harassing Rita and Violet. Maddie, Rita, and Violet flee after the confrontation turns violent, witnessed by student Goldie Goldman, who flees with them. Later, Legs finds Maddie at her house from the address in a notebook Maddie dropped in Mr. Buttinger's classroom. Legs spends the night at Maddie's house and bonds with her further in the morning before school.  Maddie finds out at school that she, Rita, Violet, and Goldie are being suspended for the confrontation of Mr. Buttinger, despite their explanation of what happened. After getting kicked out of school, the girls go to an abandoned house where Maddie suggested Legs stay, finding Legs there. All five girls quickly form a close bond, with the abandoned house as their "headquarters" and engaging in further acts of rebellion, such as breaking into the school to retrieve part of Maddie's art school application (which the principal refused to let her get before she got kicked out) and Legs tattooing a flame on all of them. Legs and Maddie also learn that Goldie's father physically abuses her. Everything culminates when the girls crash a car stolen from a group of boys who were about to rape Maddie.  Though not seriously injured, the girls go on trial for stealing the car, with the boys and one of their girlfriends, Cindy, lying about the events leading up to it. Legs is sent to a juvenile prison and the group flounders without her, with Goldie starting to use heroin. Eventually, Cindy, feeling guilty, tells the judge the truth, leading to Legs' release.  The girls' reunion is tempered by Legs learning of Goldie's addiction; Maddie has taken to the abandoned house to detox. In an effort to help her, Legs leads Maddie, Rita, and Violet to Goldie's house to demand $10,000 from her parents to send Goldie to rehab. The situation escalates when Goldie's father refuses and Legs, holding him at gunpoint, forces the others to take him to the abandoned house. He is tied to a chair while the girls try to think of what to do next, and the tension rises as Legs begins taking her own paternal frustrations out on him. Throughout the chaos, Rita, who was told to hold the gun on Goldie's father, accidentally shoots him in the shoulder.  Panic ensues and the girls resolve to get Goldie's father to the hospital. When Goldie, Rita, and Violet leave with Goldie's father, Maddie realizes Legs is missing. She finds Legs walking along the bridge, looking for a ride to another town. Both girls make proposals, Maddie for Legs to stay with her and the others and Legs for Maddie to join her on the road. Sad but resolute, the two eventually go their separate ways. Legs gets a truck to stop and boards as Maddie watches it disappear.  In a [[voice-over]], it's revealed that Maddie finishes high school and goes on to art school. She travels the world, always stopping at airports and bus stops along the way. Although none of the group ever see Legs again, they still get together once in a while and strengthen their bond over the past.

Within that journey, he finds out what Jo Beth has been doing to him.  Jo Beth has proceeded to pretend that her purse was stolen in order to have the old credit cards, ATM cards, and their checking account turned off, and have new numbers issued.  She also sells all of the stocks they held, and even sold their classic [[Ford Thunderbird]].  She even went so far as to draw up a contract turning over her entire business to her friend who works with her in order for Nick not to be able to get his hands on any of it in the divorce.  After Nick's son, Eric, gets a letter showing he was accepted to Dorsett, the prestigious prep school his father went to, he runs to the [[airport]] to meet his dad to tell him the good news.

Nick gets home to Dallas after having two credit cards confiscated, and finding out his Thunderbird was gone, and wonders what is going on.  He gets home to find out from his son that Jo Beth had a heart attack.  At the same time, he sent Miriam off to his friend's apartment playing it off as his own.  However, his friend finally gets sick of playing the game and tells Miriam the truth, so she goes to the hospital to confront Nick.  At the hospital Nick finds Allison and finds out Jo Beth refuses to let him into the room she's in.  When Miriam arrives, she finds out the whole truth, then slaps Jack across his face, threatens him with her father, and leaves in a huff.  Meanwhile, Allison simply says she's not going to relocate to Dallas and packs up back for Chicago, but not before giving Nick a final kiss, and telling him she always knew he was too good to be true.  Three months later after he and Jo Beth's divorce (the other two were officially null and void due to [[bigamy]] laws), he is on another flight pattern from the one he was on before, plus he sees Jo Beth send Eric off to Dorsett.  He would explain to his friend why he tried to be married to all three girls. (He was always afraid he would lose one of them.)

Gamera 2: Attack of Legion
 A year has passed since the battle between [[Gamera]] and the [[Gyaos]], and [[Japan]] has struggled to rebuild its cities in the meantime. The military has kept a cautious vigil on the nation's coast, but so far Gamera has yet to return. Then on the night of a meteor shower, while out on field trip Science instructor Midori Honami and her group of kids witness a huge meteor plunges into the mountain snow. The next night, two security guards are horrified as they see large insect-like creatures stealing glass bottles from a nearby warehouse. Soon after, the entire city of [[Sapporo]] is covered with strange plants and the link between these events soon becomes clear. These series of bizarre incidents reveal a new threat to the Land of the Rising Sun.  The meteor has carried with it a species of [[extraterrestrials]]. These aliens have set up a hive in the bowels of the city's subway tunnels, deliberately nurturing a plant that grows out of the subway and into the city. Soon a gigantic pod erupts from a building and Colonel Watarase of the Self Defense Force realizes that it is dramatically raising the city's oxygen levels. Working together with the swift-minded Miss Honami, he realizes that the aliens are building a huge biological launchpad: the increased oxygen will aid the creatures in exploding the flower, catapulting its seed into space so that they can colonize yet another world. The military can only watch helplessly, as any attempt to destroy the plant would destroy all of Sapporo.  Just as all hope is lost, Gamera emerges from the sea and heads toward the besieged city. He tears the flower out by its roots, but is ambushed by a swarm of the alien insect soldiers. As Gamera thrashes to rid himself of the attacking insects, a nearby soldier names them "Legion," in reference to something similar about a person possessed by many evil spirits called Legion mentioned in the Holy Bible. Gamera is forced to retreat, just as the monstrous Legion queen bursts out of the ground and flies off to start a second hive. Her wings are damaged by fighter jets, but she survives. Again a Legion flower blooms, this time in [[Sendai]], and again Gamera attempts to stop its explosion. He is intercepted, however, by Legion. Legion makes short work of Gamera, impaling him with her sharp legs and blasting him with her horn beam. Sensing the detonation of her pod approaching, Legion leaves Gamera for dead and burrows off. Gamera limps toward the plant, destroying it by knocking it down before it launches its seed into space. The flower explodes and completely annihilates Sendai, seemingly killing Gamera.  Japan's military and scientists race to find Legion's weakness, but have so far found only one clue: the smaller symbiotic Legion are attracted to any electromagnetic source, such as power lines. While this may enable the army to distract them, it has the unfortunate side-effect of drawing them to [[Tokyo]]. Asagi visits the ruined city where Gamera lies comatose and as she tries to reach out to him, the [[orihalcum]] pendant that enables their bond shatters. Gamera awakens, but at the sacrifice of his human connection.  Legion marches on to Tokyo with the intention of planting a third and final flower, but Gamera heads her off in the outskirts. She spawns a swarm of insect soldiers against him, but the military manages to draw them off and destroy them with an electric distraction. Gamera and Legion fight all over the suburbs and the military lobs a few missiles at Legion in aid. Finally, Gamera manages to tear off Legion's horn and she momentarily collapses in defeat. Suddenly, Legion rises up and fires laser whips from her stump into Gamera. On the verge of defeat, Gamera then looks into the sky and roars and light begins to shine down upon him. As Legion closes in, Gamera's chest opens up and fires a powerful plasma beam. Legion is hit by the blast and is blown apart.  Gamera glances toward the human onlookers and then ascends into the morning sky. As they watch Gamera fades into the distance, mankind is unsettled by his power and trembles lest he should ever view humanity as an enemy.

The Ghost and the Darkness
 In 1898, Sir Robert Beaumont, the primary financier of a railroad project in [[Tsavo]], [[Kenya]], is furious because the project is running behind schedule. He seeks out the expertise of Lt. Colonel [[John Henry Patterson (author)|John Henry Patterson]], a British military engineer, to get the project back on track. Patterson travels from England to Tsavo, telling his wife, Helena, he will complete the project and be back in London for the birth of their son. He meets British supervisor Angus Starling, Kenyan foreperson Samuel, and Doctor David Hawthorne. Hawthorne tells Patterson of a recent lion attack that has affected the project.  That night, Patterson kills an approaching lion with one shot, earning the respect of the workers and bringing the project back on schedule. However, not long afterwards, Mahina, the construction foreman, is dragged from his tent in the middle of the night. His half-eaten body is found the next morning. Patterson then attempts a second night-time lion hunt, but the following morning, another worker is found dead at the opposite end of the camp from Patterson's position.  Patterson's only comfort now is the letters he receives from his wife. Soon, while the workers are gathering wood and building fire pits around the tents, a lion attacks the camp in the middle of the day, killing another worker. While Patterson, Starling and Samuel are tracking it to one end of the camp, another lion leaps upon them from the roof of a building, killing Starling with a slash to the throat and injuring Patterson. Despite the latter's efforts to kill them, both lions escape. Samuel states that there has never been a pair of [[man-eater]]s; they have always been solitary hunters.  The workers, led by Abdullah, begin to turn on Patterson. Work on the bridge comes to a halt. Patterson requests soldiers from England to protect the workers, but is denied. During a visit to the camp, Beaumont tells Patterson he will ruin his reputation if the bridge is not finished on time and that he will contact the famous hunter Charles Remington to help because Patterson has been unable to kill the animals.  Remington arrives with skilled [[Maasai people|Maasai]] warriors to help kill the lions. They dub the lions "the Ghost" and "the Darkness" because of their notorious methods of attack. The initial attempt fails when Patterson's borrowed gun misfires. The warriors decide to leave, but Remington stays behind. He constructs a new hospital for sick and injured workers and tempts the lions to the abandoned building with animal parts and blood. When the lions fall for the trap, Remington and Patterson shoot at them; they flee and attack the new hospital, killing many patients and Hawthorne.  Abdullah and the construction men leave, and only Patterson, Remington, and Samuel remain behind to face the marauders. Patterson and Remington locate the animals' lair, discovering the bones of dozens of the lions' victims. That night, Remington kills one of the pair by using Patterson and a baboon as bait. The workers celebrate, though later Patterson dreams about his wife and infant son visiting him in Tsavo, only for them to be killed by the remaining lion before he can get to them.  Waking from his nightmare the next morning, Patterson discovers that the remaining lion has dragged Remington from his tent and killed him; Patterson and Samuel [[cremation|cremate]] Remington's corpse on a [[pyre]] at the spot where he died. Grief-stricken and desperate to end the carnage, the two men burn the tall grass surrounding the camp, driving the surviving lion toward the camp (and the ambush they set there). The lion attacks Patterson and Samuel on the partially constructed bridge and after a lengthy fight, Patterson finally kills it. Abdullah and the construction workers return, and the bridge is completed on time. The movie closes with a voice-over from Samuel stating the lions today are on display at the Field Museum in Chicago and "even today, if you look into their eyes...you will be afraid."  
Ghosts of Mississippi
 [[Medgar Evers]] was a black civil rights activist in [[Mississippi]] who was murdered by an assassin on June 12, 1963. It was suspected that [[Byron De La Beckwith]], a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]], was the murderer. He had been tried twice and both trials ended in hung juries. In 1989, Evers' widow Myrlie, who had been trying to bring De La Beckwith to justice for over 25 years, believed she had what it takes to bring him to trial again. Although most of the evidence from the old trial had disappeared, [[Bobby DeLaughter]], an assistant [[District Attorney]], decided to help her despite being warned that it might hurt his political aspirations and despite the strain that it caused in his marriage. DeLaughter becomes primarily involved with bringing De La Beckwith to trial for the third time 30 years later. In 1994, Byron De La Beckwith was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment, giving justice to the family of Medgar Evers.  
Get on the Bus
  Fifteen disparate [[African American]] men board a bus in Los Angeles bound for Washington, D.C., where they plan on attending the [[Million Man March]]. Other than their race, destination, and gender, the men have nothing in common: George is the trip organizer; Xavier is an aspiring filmmaker hoping to make a documentary of the March; Flip is the vain but charismatic and openly homophobic and sexist actor; Kyle and Randall are a homosexual couple; Gary, a biracial police officer; Jamal is a former [[gang|gang banger]] turned devout [[Muslim]] who has evaded prosecution for the murders he committed; Evan Jr., is a petty criminal who has been permitted to break probation to attend the march on the condition that he remain handcuffed to his father, Evan Sr.  As the bus travels across country, Xavier conducts interviews with the various attendees, allowing them to express their views on race, religion, and politics. The interviews often provoke outbursts from other men on the bus, invariably leading to many political confrontations. Jeremiah, the eldest member of the group, is an 80-year-old former alcoholic who lost his job and family, has found new meaning in life and is energized by the Million Man March, and embraces his African heritage; his philosophies on the black experience and stories of precolonial Africa serve to unite the men and ease tensions and the infighting among them.  En route the bus breaks down and the men are forced to board another bus, driven by an ethnically [[Jewish]] white man named Rick. A couple of the passengers harass Rick as a white man, and Rick ultimately refuses to drive any further, citing the group's prejudice and his opposition to antisemitic remarks made by the leader of the march, [[Louis Farrakhan]]. George, himself a bus driver, accuses Rick of cultural [[racism]], but begrudgingly agrees to cover for Rick who leaves. George takes over driving for the remainder of the trip, with help from Evan Sr.  As the bus passes through the American south, the men are greeted hospitably by several white southerners at various restaurants and rest stops. At one stop, the men pick up Wendell, a wealthy African American [[Lexus]] salesman who sees attending the march as a way to make business connections. After Wendell, a self-proclaimed conservative Republican makes disparaging remarks about who he sees as lazy and stupid African Americans—while getting some agreement from Kyle, ultimately is too insulting and just wants to make money off the march, and the rest of the men forcibly toss him out of the bus.  In [[Knoxville]], Tennessee, the bus is pulled over by a pair of racist state troopers, who accuse the men of using the bus to smuggle drugs. The bus and its passengers are checked by a drug-sniffing police dog, turning up no evidence of drugs; the troopers then condescendingly allow the bus to resume its journey.  As the bus nears Washington, Jeremiah passes out and is rushed to a hospital. The doctors there discover that Jeremiah is suffering from advanced [[coronary artery disease]], which made the stress of the trip potentially deadly for him. Evan Sr. and Jr., Gary, Jamal, and Xavier opt to stay with Jeremiah at the hospital and watch the march on television while the rest of the men leave in the bus to attend. Shortly after they leave, Jeremiah dies. The rest of the group returns to the hospital, saying that, to stay true to the spirit of the March, they chose not to attend the march but to return and be with Jeremiah.  As the bus prepares to return to Los Angeles, the men find a [[prayer]] that Jeremiah wrote with the intention of praying it when the bus arrived at Washington, D.C. The men drive to the [[Lincoln Memorial]], where George leads the men in Jeremiah's prayer, and the film ends with Evan Jr. and Senior's handcuffs left at the Lincoln memorial.

The Glimmer Man
 Jack Cole ([[Steven Seagal]]) was once a government intelligence operative known as "The Glimmer Man," because he could move so quickly and quietly through the jungle that his victims would only see a glimmer before they died. Having left the Glimmer Man job behind him, Cole—steeped in [[buddhism]] and not used to working with others has become a detective with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]].  Cole is partnered with Jim Campbell ([[Keenen Ivory Wayans]]), a tough, no-nonsense cop who has little patience for Cole's [[New Age]] philosophies and outsider attitude. Cole and Campbell have to set aside their differences when they're assigned to track down a [[serial killer]] called "The Family Man," for his habit of killing entire households.  The Family Man's latest victims turn out to be Cole's former wife Ellen and her current husband Andrew Dunleavy—and Cole's [[fingerprint]]s are found on Ellen's body. Cole and Campbell think that Cole's former bosses in the government may somehow be involved in the killings. Cole contacts his friend Smith ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]), unaware that he has been working with local crime boss Frank Deverell ([[Bob Gunton]]).  Cole and Campbell receive a tip that leads them to Christopher Maynard ([[Stephen Tobolowsky]]), who admits that he committed the Family Man murders that happened before Cole arrived in [[Los Angeles]]. Someone else has been committing the more recent murders and making it look like Maynard's work. Cole fatally shoots Maynard in [[self defense]].  Cole, hoping to get a lead on the new killer, goes to the home of Deverell's [[Russian people|Russian]] translator Celia Roslov (Susan Reno), who was a victim of the killer.

Cole and Campbell discover that Deverell's stepson Johnny ([[Johnny Strong]]) knows some important information. Johnny tells Cole and Campbell that Deverell's right-hand man, Donald Cunningham ([[John M. Jackson]]), is the new killer who has been making his killings look like Maynard's work.  Johnny also tells them that Smith has been working with Deverell. Cole and Campbell confront Smith, and torture him into revealing that Deverell is smuggling chemical weapons into the USA from [[Russia]], with plans to sell the weapons to the [[Serbia]]n mafia. Smith made the contacts, with the deal being cut by the [[Russians|Russian]] mafia known as the Russian Liberation Fighters. The meeting for the deal is scheduled to take place at a downtown [[welfare]] hotel. Cole and Campbell storm the hotel, where Cunningham fatally shoots Deverell, and Cole kills Cunningham by throwing him through a window and onto a [[wrought iron]] fence below.

Girl 6
 Judy (Theresa Randle) is a young and timid African American woman living in New York, who has dreams of becoming a successful actress. With the help of her agent Murray (John Turturro), she is given a chance to audition with [[Quentin Tarantino]] (himself). Tarantino reveals that this is a big blockbuster groundbreaking film, and it is "the greatest romantic, African-American film ever made."  Judy who at first seems to be doing quite well with her audition, becomes uncomfortable when Quentin Tarantino asks her to undress herself. Judy under the impression that the film wasn't related to that type of nature, becomes very apprehensive and defiant, and contemplates leaving. After Quentin Tarantino's assistant tells her that she is wasting their time and they have other people to consider and that she needs to make a choice, she reluctantly does decide to partially undress herself revealing her breasts. However becoming quickly overwhelmed with guilt, Judy storms out of the audition.  After finding out she walked out of the audition, Murray becomes furious. Having worked hard to get Judy her audition with such a prestigious director, he quickly and angrily drops her from his roster of clients. Her melodramatic acting coach (Susan Batson), is also extremely displeased at her lack of compassion to her acting art, and attitude towards the entertainment industry. When Judy tells her she felt uncomfortable by being asked to undress herself, the acting coach still does not see any reason why Judy should have walked out, and that she should have just complied with what they told her to do. This, topped with the fact that her acting coach is concerned as to why Judy is not paying her for her services, due to the fact Judy is currently having financial issues. She drops Judy from her roster of clients as well.  Now unable to secure acting work and pursue her dream, Judy must find a way to make ends meet. She tries a number of jobs, which include passing out fliers on the street for technology classes and seminars, becoming a [[cocktail waitress]] at a nightclub, and working as a background extra actor being treated unfairly in harsh conditions for local productions.  One night whilst Judy is reading the newspaper returning home from her part-time job at the nightclub on a crowded subway, she skims through the circulars and classifieds, and sees a want-ad that says, "friendly phone line", as well as, "mo money, mo money, mo money". In a sly way, she decides to fake cough and rip that advertisement out of the paper to cover her mouth, to make it seem like she was using the newspaper as a tissue and puts it in her purse, to not draw embarrassment for herself.  The advertisement is for a [[answering service|call center]], which specializes in customer service and phone sex. To which Judy is inquiring to be a phone sex operator. Judy meets her new boss, Lil, (Jenifer Lewis) who seems to be an assertive but friendly woman. Lil interviews Judy for the position, and the both of them click. However, Lil frankly tells her she has other prospects, and that she cannot make her any promises, but she really made a good impression with her. Judy then attends interviews with other phone sex companies, including one run by a stripper (Madonna), who explains to her that unlike other phone sex companies that would have her working in a building, she would be able to work in the privacy of her own home, and have fewer to no restrictions on her. She would however have to have her own private telephone line, which Judy currently does not have. She still decides to keep this opportunity in mind for future reference.  Ultimately, Judy is hired by Lil to work as a phone sex operator at the call center. During orientation and training with other newly hired phone sex operators, she is now dubbed "Girl 6", and told by Lil that despite the fact most of the girls on the team are African-American, unless requested otherwise by the caller himself, they should always give the impression they are Caucasian. Judy very quickly learns the ropes, and becomes comfortable with her new job, and fits right in.  Judy's cousin and best friend Jimmy (Spike Lee), who lives in the same complex as her, and is obsessed with sports memorabilia and collecting, is very adverse to Judy working as a phone sex operator, and finds it very perverse and strange, and warns her about the dangers of doing something like that. Judy also occasionally while out running errands sees her [[kleptomaniac]] ex-boyfriend (Isaiah Washington), to which she explains to him she is putting her aspiring acting career on hold, and is now a phone sex operator. He seems to be supportive of her with that.  The effects from working at the phone sex company, is Judy who was once an innocent girl, is now becoming more sexually bold in her attitude and personality. This shows as Judy starts to develop a crush on a man named "Bob Regular" (Peter Berg), who on a daily basis calls the phone sex company and strictly asks for her. To which Judy adapts the nickname "Lovely", especially for him. Unlike the other callers who want a sexual fantasy or thrill, "Bob" simply associates in friendly conversation with her. Judy begins to experience positive imagery and empathy of him, although what could be false and incorrect assumptions and lies to which "Bob" explains to her.  Judy becomes very close with "Bob", and after "Bob" who explains that he's originally from Arizona, says he's currently in town and not far from her, and they agree to meet up at [[Coney Island]] amusement park, during her lunch break. Judy waits for Bob, but he never arrives, and a depressed Judy returns to work.  Upon returning to work at the phone sex company, Judy immediately and strangely receives a call request, and it's a very frightening and obscene man disrespecting her (Michael Imperioli). Lil who was monitoring her call disconnects him, and bans him from calling. She reminds her that she is being far too nice to the men that call in, and that she needs to be more stern and careful. The man however oddly connects back to Judy's phone, and disrespects her more.  As time goes on, Judy suddenly is now becoming very angry and bitter, and it is visible to everybody, especially Lil, that Judy is having a breakdown. Lil temporarily fires Judy from the company, and tells her to take care of herself, and that's she is free to return after that. Judy however quickly goes back to the original offer the woman who worked at the strip club gave her, and is able to now get a private line, and decides to become a private phone sex operator in her home. Judy also becomes to be more sexually aroused and comfortable from the callers in her private line.  One night while taking calls from her private line, she goes into a very explicit and perverse [[S&M]] and snuff related conversation. Judy soon realizes that she is talking to the same exact man that called her incidentally and immediately after "Bob Regular" stood her up at Coney Island. The man is even more disrespectful than he was before, and saying very rude things to her. Due to the graphic nature of the conversation, it later turns out the man is possibly a serial killer, and gives very graphic sexual and homicidal details as to what turns him on. Judy disconnects the call, but despite that, the man continually calls back, even though she is ignoring him and disconnecting the numbers he is calling from. Judy eventually gives in, to which she tells him to leave her alone. The man then shockingly reveals that he knows exactly where she lives, and says her exact location. Judy scared and irate, finally snaps at him, to which the caller is satisfied at her anger and is pleased by it.  Immediately after that, Judy out of fear runs to Jimmy's house and asks if she could stay with him, to which he allows her to. She decides that it is time to leave the phone sex career behind and move to [[Los Angeles]], for her acting career. Before leaving, she makes amends with her ex-boyfriend.  Now living in Los Angeles and continuing her dream to become an actress, Judy attends another audition with a director (Ron Silver) which parallels and is almost an identical to her experience with Tarantino. She decides to leave the audition, however this time, Judy has a different approach, and happily walks down the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Judy has reclaimed her dignity.  
Gokulathil Seethai
 Rishi (Karthik) sleeps around through the efforts of a sophisticated, dedicated and ‘immigration officer’ look alike pimp (‘Thailaivasal’ Vijay). His Dad (Manivannan) whom Rishi considers to be his ‘friend’ voices his concern in a friendly way about Rishi’s life style and suggests him to try falling in love instead of spending all his hard earned money on call girls. Rishi brushes him off asking him to only worry about his earnings and that he would take of care of the expenditure.  Rishi offers his employee/old friend I.C. Mohan (Karan) to take him to a show. Although hesitant at first (as Mohan refers I.C. to be inferiority complex), he agrees. The show turns out be a college show where a beautiful looking Nila (Suvalaxmi), doing her final year BBA performs a song. Mohan feels he has had one of his best days as he falls instantly in love with her. On the contrast, Rishi instantly sets his sexual sight on her.  Rishi calls on the pimp to book Nila. The pimp gives his professional shot at it and ends up in jail. Rishi bails him out. I.C. Mohan sends a tape that has his recital of her song irritating Nila. She tries to throw the tape away but her friends offer to use the tape to record something else. Intrigued by a couple of flower bouquets, she finds out the information about Rishi and meets him personally. Rishi proposes to sleep with her one night. Nila rejects his ‘proposal’ despite Rishi offering half of his property and walks away. But Rishi is quietly resolute to woo her into bed one night.  When Nila returns to her hostel, she finds the ‘tape’ to have more info into it and hears a whining I.C. Mohan’s marriage proposal. Nila takes sympathy towards Mohan and meets him at a beach and lays down her rules straight: "She would fall in love, but only after marriage" and that she is determined to be behind the success of a man she marries. She asks him to meet her mother ‘formally’ if he is too desperate. While Nila takes a hiatus and visits home, her mother informs Nila that their family ‘doctor’ friend is interested in marrying her. It is implied that she informs Mohan about this. Mohan meets up with Rishi at a restaurant and confesses that he had lied to him and that he is really in love and that ‘she’ is about to get married. On hearing that ‘she’ is Nila, Rishi is stumped and takes a brief moment to himself to kill his own sexual urge and decides to help his ‘only’ friend and gives him an idea to forge a letter and that he would take care of the rest.  When Rishi passes the letter through a drunk Stranger to Nila on the night before her wedding, she shows it to her ‘doctor’ groom. The Doctor reads the ‘suicide’ note and empathizes with Mohan and encourages Nila to go ahead and marry him, wishing her good luck, promising that he would marry Nila’s sister instead. Nila sneaks out of the wedding hall and gets into a car. The car stops halfway through and Nila is surprised to see Rishi in the driver seat. Rishi reveals his surprise that Nila hasn’t ran away from the car and subtly acknowledges his own defeat. The car stops at a house. Rishi lets Nila out and tells her that the house was where he was born and that that’s where her ‘first night’ is going to happen and asks her to go in. Nila warns Rishi that her first night will turn out to be Rishi’s last night. Rishi sarcastically approves her "bravado" but still encourages her to go in. Nila enters that house confused until she sees Mohan begging his Parents and his sister to approve his love for Nila. What follows is an ugly altercation among the four. Rishi who is drinking outside the house hears this and enters in. Mohan tells his parents that Rishi is his boss and he gave the house as a gift for their upcoming wedding. Mohan’s parents talk ill of Rishi and sarcastically suggest him to marry Nila since he gave her a ride in the middle of the night. Mohan changes his mind soon and asks Rishi to drop Nila back off at the wedding hall. Rishi gets upset at Mohan and tries to convince him about Nila’s trust but in vain. Nila gives up on Mohan and asks Rishi to leave the place. Rishi leaves the house calling Mohan an "idiot". He offers Nila to drop her off at the wedding hall. But Nila hesitates to go back worrying about her sister’s future. Rishi offers his own house until she finds a place on her own. Nila who is initially skeptical accepts the offer after Rishi’s word that he’ll never mistreat someone in despair.  Rishi’s Dad believes in his word and remarks to him that for the first time in Rishi’s life that a woman is in need of his services that draws a sarcastic comment from the Cook (Pandu) on being asked to take care of the guest (Nila). Next day Rishi tells Mohan that he should’ve fired him for what he did the previous night but lets him stay due to his family debts but confirms that their friendship is over. Rishi later takes Nila to a party where his friends mistake her for a call girl and embarrass her by asking her price per night. Rishi gets angry and storms out of the place with Nila. Rishi apologizes to Nila for what happened but she shrugs it off by letting him know that Rishi had never been out with his mom or sisters or any other decent woman. This hurts Rishi who drinks too much and they get into a big argument. Nila cools him off by offering her friendship.  The Pimp visits Rishi at his home next day and is surprised to see Nila in and congratulates him on his conquest. Rishi clarifies to him that she is just a platonic friend and that he made a mistake and ruined her life. That day Nila suggests a critical business solution to Rishi and his Dad who asks Rishi to hire her immediately. During a business lunch at the office, Rishi subtly suggests to Nila that she could still reconsider her decision about Mohan. Nila diplomatically changes the topic. A ‘gossip’ fight within the office premise between Mohan and a Colleague leads Rishi to intervene and stop. Mohan argues that he entered into Nila’s life at the first place which makes Nila angry who lashes out at Mohan pointing that he has never crossed her life at any point. She also says good things about Rishi and clarifies their relationship to other employees (a reference to epic ‘Ramayana’ is made by Nila where everyone knows Sita’s stage of life in Ashokavanam, but if Sita had been in ‘Gokulam’ she would’ve been safer & happier) that makes him feel good. Later, Rishi feels bemused on being asked to get out of Nila’s room for her to be able to change her clothes after shower and starts to feel something new that he has never felt before and leaves the room.  An excited Rishi admits to his dad that if what he feels is love, he just loves ‘this love’ and asks his dad to speak to Nila on behalf of him. Dad agrees but when he privately talks to Nila he asks her a question that upsets her and she leaves the house. A totally confused Rishi asks Nila as to what upset her. She doesn’t reply but keeps walking on. After jumping out at his dad for messing things up he leaves the house in pursuit of Nila. He tries to convince her in a bus where she is able to spare change to get a ticket to a place. When the bus conductor asks Rishi for change, he gives his credit card which the bus conductor has no clue about. They argue until a ticket inspector intervenes and tells Rishi that a credit card would work in a 5 star hotel but not in a local town bus and drops him off. Nila stays silent during the whole time.  Rishi goes back home, argues with his dad on having asked her such a stupid question and points out the differences between them and tells him that their relationship is over. He also asks his dad to get the heck out of his house for which his dad laughs and points out that the entire wealth is his hard earned money and if someone has to get out, it should be Rishi. At that moment a phone call reveals that Nila had mentioned Rishi as her guardian at a ladies hostel. Rishi proudly points that out to his dad and storms out. Later, when the Cook criticizes Rishi’s dad for having done this to his son, dad reveals that he talked to Nila the way he did not just to test her but to test Rishi as well. He also goes on to reveal that he is happy that Rishi is able to decide on his own and that he is confident that he’ll come back.  Rishi visits Nila at the hostel after a brief altercation with the security guard. Nila avoids talking to Rishi who understands her anger and reveals to the entire group of women gathered there that the reason for his visit was not to force or harass Nila but to acknowledge that she has transformed him into a human being and that she is the only reason that he is now able to respect any woman. He bids goodbye and leaves as Nila stops him, cries and apologizes that she mistook Rishi to be a jerk like Mohan when he sent his dad to speak on his behalf but now realizes that he did it out of respect for her. She also accepts defeat of her own agenda by concluding that "there is nothing wrong in falling in love with someone like Rishi before marriage" and tells him that she loves him and they leave the hostel together.  
Gotti (1996 film)
 The film starts In 1973 in New York, and ends in 1992, with Gotti's imprisonment. Gotti's association with three mobsters is also highlighted in the film: a father-son like relationship with family underboss [[Aniello Dellacroce|Aniello "Mr. Neil" Dellacroce]], his deep but rocky friendship with Gotti crew member and longtime friend [[Angelo Ruggiero]], and the respect and ultimate frustration that he felt for the man who became his underboss, [[Sammy Gravano|Salvatore "Sammy the Bull" Gravano]]. The film details Gotti's rise within the Gambino crime family and his ranks from soldier, then captain (or ''[[caporegime|capo]]''), and finally, [[crime boss|boss]]. The final title was achieved through the dramatic murder in public of Gambino family boss [[Paul Castellano]] in 1985. Following the murder of Castellano, the film concentrates on the legal trials of John Gotti: one for assault and two for [[racketeering]] under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations]] (RICO) statutes. Gotti's famous personality, trial acquittals, and media attention are all dramatized. The film ends with Gotti's conviction and sentencing to [[life imprisonment]] at [[Marion Federal Penitentiary]] in [[Marion, Illinois]], because Gravano turns state's evidence and agrees to testify against Gotti.  The film is primarily based on the columns of reporter [[Jerry Capeci]], who also wrote the novel that documented Gotti's rise and fall inside the Gambino crime family, and served as [[executive producer]] of the film which was based on his novel.  
Goodbye South, Goodbye
 Gao ([[Jack Kao]]) rides the train to [[Pingxi District|Pinghsi]] to set up a 10-day gambling den with his friend Hsi (Hsi Hsiang). He takes his acolyte Flatty ([[Lim Giong]]) and Pretzel ([[Annie Yi|Annie Shizuka Inoh]]), Flatty's girlfriend, who works part-time in a night club. Gao's girlfriend Ying (Hsu Kuei-Ying) works in the same night club as Pretzel and doesn't like the people around Gao, finding them dangerous. Gao has already made a deal with Hsi to invest in a nightclub in Shanghai, but Ying doesn't want him to go. Instead, she wants him to stay in Taiwan to open a restaurant. A succession of [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s leads them to the brink of disaster. Throughout the course of the film the unsavory alliance between the underworld and the political elite emerges.  
Grace of My Heart
  The film opens in the year 1958 where Edna Buxton ([[Illeana Douglas]]) is a steel heiress living in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, who wants to be a singer and enters a talent contest. The story begins with a conversation between herself and her mother ([[Christina Pickles]]) with regard to what she will sing and what she will wear.  At her mother's insistence, she reluctantly makes a plan to sing "You'll Never Walk Alone." Edna is even less thrilled about her mother's choice of wardrobe, calling it uncomfortable.  Her mother responds with a cutting remark, "Perhaps it's not the dress.  Perhaps it's you who doesn't fit, dear."  Backstage at the contest, she meets a blues singer named Doris Shelley (Jennifer Leigh Warren). Doris advises Edna to follow her heart, and the two women trade dresses. Clad in Doris’s sleek black dress, Edna sings "Hey There" instead.  Despite the fact that she wins the contest, she loses the respect of her mother, who has since left the theater in humiliation.  An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer ([[Richard Schiff]]) tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters.  When she tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner ([[John Turturro]]) who takes her under his wing, renames her "Denise Waverly" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit.  Denise (formerly Edna) moves to New York City and becomes a songwriter in the Brill Building. At a party, she meets the arrogant songwriter Howard Caszatt ([[Eric Stoltz]]), and despite an awkward initial meeting they become romantically involved. She also reunites with Doris, who is not only singing at the party that night, but apologizes for keeping Denise’s expensive dress after all that time. She insists it was because she wasn’t sure how or where to return it.  Meanwhile, Denise offers to and writes a song specifically for Doris and her two girlfriends.  She persuades a reluctant Milner to audition the group. Milner likes the group and the song Denise has written, and renames the group The Luminaries.  In 1965, at Howard's insistence, he and Denise begin writing together; partly out of respect for her talent, but primarily because she's had greater mainstream and commercial success.  His songs had been deemed "too controversial" and had been repeatedly banned from radio airplay.  She overhears an argument between Sha-Sha (Kathy Barbour)’s niece Annie ([[Tracy Vilar]]) and her boyfriend.  It turns out the young teen is pregnant.  Denise and Howard pen the song “Unwanted Number” based on the girl’s struggle.  Although it's banned, it attracts the attention of prominent and influential disc jockey John Murray ([[Bruce Davison]]) who, despite the negative attention of the song, credits Denise with sparking the craze for girl groups.  Denise then suggests that she and Howard should write a wedding-themed song for the Luminaries. Howard says he doesn't believe in marriage, but when Denise reveals that she is pregnant with Howard's child, they are married and have a daughter.  Life is idyllic for Denise with a family and successful songwriting career.  Milner then recruits the beautiful English songwriter Cheryl Steed ([[Patsy Kensit]]), who immediately catches Howard’s eye, and ultimately Denise’s disdain.  Cheryl immediately diffuses the flirtation by informing the couple that she already has a songwriting partner—her husband Matthew ([[Chris Isaak]]).  Joel tasks Denise and Cheryl with collaboration on a song for the ingénue singer Kelly Porter ([[Bridget Fonda]]). The women protest but, nevertheless, bond over the realization that the young songstress is in a closeted lesbian relationship.  Their song “My Secret Love” is the hit that is born out of this situation.  Denise arrives home unexpectedly and finds Howard in bed with another woman; not long afterward, she learns that she is pregnant with Howard's second baby; Cheryl convinces her to see an obstetrician, who safely performs an illegal abortion. Denise and Cheryl then become close friends.  Over the next few years, Denise throws herself into her work and becomes highly successful. Having broken up with Howard, she has a brief but unhappy affair with the married John Murray, which ends when he moves with his family to Chicago.  In 1966, Denise is despondent over the end of her affair with Murray.  As a means of cheering her up, he finally offers to send her to the studio to sing for herself.  As added incentive, he offers the production assistance of California wunderkind Jay Phillips to produce her single.  She’s initially hesitant, saying she finds the whole "surf and turf" sound laughable.  She writes and sings "God Give Me Strength," and is delighted by Jay's skillful orchestral arrangement. Her record, however, bombs.  Between the loss suffered by her foundering single and the advent of the British invasion. Milner's fortunes are depleted.  Denise blames herself for making the song too personal and bankrupting Joel.  He tells her she did more for him than she realized and that it was time for then both to move on.  Denise and Jay become a couple and resettle in California. Things seem fine for a while; Annie has stayed on to help take care of Denise’s daughter Luna, and the child becomes like a sister to Annie’s son. Jay is affectionate and showers love on both children, but is reclusive and a user of recreational drugs like marijuana and peyote.  He disapproves of Denise writing songs for television-she’s since joined forces with the newly divorced Cheryl who is writing for a Bubblegum pop TV show called Where the Action Is. He insists that it's beneath her and hopes that she'll fail.  Jay's behavior becomes more erratic, and he becomes increasingly paranoid.  His songwriting becomes too avant garde and his band mates distance themselves from him. He takes the children on an outing, and comes home, having completely forgotten them.  When the police bring them home safely, Jay realizes what he’s done and drifts into a deep depression causing him to become even more isolated.  The depression seemingly abates after a visit from his friend "Jonesy", who reminds him of the things that are important in his life, including his "groovy new old lady", Denise.  Thinking that the worst is over, Denise invites Jay to join her and Cheryl at the Whiskey a Go-Go to hear Doris (who embarked on a solo career in LA when The Luminaries broke up) and her new boyfriend sing.  Jay begs off, saying he's got a song idea he wants to explore.  He promises a night of lovemaking when she returns. While the women celebrate, Jay is revealed to be still in the throes of his depression; having put on a brave face for Denise's benefit.  He walks into the ocean, taking his own life.  Denise is further distraught to discover that Jay's fans blame her for not stopping his death.  Numbed by Jay's death, Denise retires with her family to a hippie commune in Northern California and tries to make sense of everything that has happened.  A year or two later, Joel Milner visits Denise at the commune and takes her and the children to dinner. That night, he criticizes how far down she's allowed her grieving to take her and that it's destroying her and her talent. Denise angrily lashes out, and she tells Milner that he'd be nothing without her success. He agrees, and the more he agrees with the angrier she becomes. She strikes him then collapses in tears, grieving for Jay. Milner consoles her and the two are reconciled.  With Joel's help and Jay's spiritual guidance from beyond, Denise is able to put the pieces of her life together to create what will become the platinum-selling work Grace of My Heart.  As she lays down the piano track for the song, her life is recounted in pictures; leading to the moment when her own mother receives a copy of her album in the mail with a handwritten note.  Seemingly proud of her daughter's success, she smiles.  Denise finally finds her fit after all.

Their rebellion sparks a series of events that change their lives and the entire town as well.<ref name=IMDB/><ref name=ALLMOV></ref><ref name=NYTR></ref>  
Gradiva (novel)
 The story is about an archaeologist named Norbert Hanold who is obsessed with a woman depicted in a bas-relief that he sees in a museum in Rome. After his return to Germany, he manages to get a plaster-cast of the relief, which he hangs on a wall in his work-room and contemplates daily. He comes to feel that her calm, quiet manner does not belong in bustling, cosmopolitan Rome, but rather in some smaller city, and one day an image comes to him of the girl in the relief walking on the peculiar stepping-stones that cross the streets in [[Pompeii]]. Soon afterwards, Hanold dreams that he has been transported back in time to meet the girl whose unusual gait so captivates him. He sees her walking in the streets of Pompeii while the hot ashes of [[Vesuvius]] subsume the city in 79 AD.  This fantastical dream leads Hanold on a real journey to Rome, Naples, and ultimately Pompeii, where, amazingly, he sees the Gradiva of his bas-relief stepping calmly and buoyantly across the lava stepping-stones. He follows her, loses her, then finds her sitting on the low steps between two pillars. He greets her in Latin, only to be answered, "If you wish to speak to me, you must do so in German." When he addresses her as if she were the girl of his dream, however, she looks at him without comprehension, gets up and leaves. Hanold calls out after her, "Are you coming here again tomorrow in the noon hour?" But she does not turn round, gives no answer, and a few moments later disappears round the corner. Hanold hurries after her, but she is nowhere to be seen. What follows is his quest to determine whether the woman he has seen is real or a delusion.

La haine
 The film depicts approximately 20 consecutive hours in the lives of three friends in their early twenties from immigrant families living in an impoverished multi-ethnic French [[housing project]] (a ZUP'''') in the suburbs of Paris, in the aftermath of a riot. Vinz ([[Vincent Cassel]]), who is [[Jew]]ish, is filled with rage. He sees himself as a gangster ready to win respect by killing a Police man, manically practising the role of Travis Bickle from the film ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' in the mirror secretly. His attitude towards police, for instance, is a simplified, stylized blanket condemnation, even to individual policemen who make an effort to steer the trio clear of troublesome situations. Hubert ([[Hubert Koundé]]) is an [[Afro-French]] boxer and small-time drug dealer, the most mature of the three, whose gymnasium was burned in the riots. The quietest, most thoughtful and wisest of the three, he sadly contemplates the ghetto and the hate around him. He expresses the wish to simply leave this world of violence and hate behind him, but does not know how since he lacks the means to do so. SaïdSayid in some English subtitles([[Saïd Taghmaoui]]) is an [[Arab]] [[Maghrebis|Maghrebi]] who inhabits the middle ground between his two friends' responses to their place in life.  A friend of theirs, Abdel Ichaha, has been brutalized by the police shortly before the riot and lies in a coma. Vinz finds a policeman's [[.44 Magnum]] revolver, lost in the riot. He vows that if their friend dies from his injuries, he will use it to kill a cop, and when he hears of Abdel's death he fantasizes carrying out his vengeance.  The three go through an aimless daily routine and struggle to entertain themselves, frequently finding themselves under police scrutiny. After Vinz nearly shoots a riot policeman and the group narrowly escapes, they take a train to Paris but encounter many of the same frustrations, and their responses to interactions with both benign and malicious Parisians cause several situations to degenerate to dangerous hostility. A run-in with sadistic [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] policemen, during which Saïd and Hubert are humiliated and racially as well as physically abused, results in their missing the last train home and spending the night on the streets. They sleep in a shopping mall and wake to a news broadcast informing them that Abdel is dead. They later travel to a roof-top from which they insult skinheads and policemen, before later encountering the same group of racist anti-immigrant skinheads who begin to beat Saïd and Hubert savagely, now that the balance of power has shifted. Vinz suddenly arrives, and his gun allows him to break up the fight; all the skinheads flee except one (portrayed by Kassovitz himself) whom Vinz is about to execute in cold blood. His dream of revenge is thwarted by his reluctance to go through with the deed, and, cleverly goaded by Hubert, he is forced to confront the fact that his true nature is not the heartless gangster he poses as, and he lets the skinhead flee.  Early in the morning, the trio returns to the [[banlieue]] and split up to their separate homes, and Vinz turns the gun over to Hubert. However, Vinz and Saïd encounter a plainclothes policeman, whom Vinz had insulted earlier in the day whilst with his friends on a local rooftop. The policeman grabs and threatens Vinz, making reference to the earlier incident on the roof. Hubert rushes to their aid, but as the policeman holding Vinz taunts him with a loaded gun held to Vinz's head, the gun accidentally goes off, killing Vinz instantly. Hubert and the policeman slowly and deliberately point their guns at each other, and as the film cuts to Saïd closing his eyes and cuts to black, a shot is heard on the soundtrack, with no indication of who fired or who may have been hit. This stand-off is underlined by a voice-over of Hubert's slightly modified opening lines ("''It's about a society in free fall...''"), underlining the fact that, as the lines say, ''jusqu'ici tout va bien'' (so far so good); ''i.e.'' all seems to be going relatively well until Vinz is killed, and from there no one knows what will happen, a microcosm of French society's descent through hostility into pointless violence.  
The Great White Hype
 James "The Grim Reaper" Roper ([[Damon Wayans]]), the undefeated heavyweight [[Undisputed Champion|boxing champ]] of the world, defeats his latest challenger with ease and visits an after-party thrown by the Rev. Fred Sultan ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]), a conniving and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] businessman who also acts as Roper's fight [[promoter (entertainment)|promoter]]. The Sultan relays some bad news to everyone: The fight was a financial flop. He deduces the reason that boxing events have become far less profitable is because audience members are sick of watching only black boxers fight each other. The Sultan predicts that a white contender, even one without a viable chance of winning, would create a huge payday for all involved in the fight (citing the [[Larry Holmes vs. Gerry Cooney]] battle in 1982 and the playing of the [[race card]] in that instance as a precedent), and he vows to either find or "create" a white contender in no time at all.  After failing to find a white boxer currently in the sport suitable by any means, he discovers that Roper actually lost to a white boxer, Terry Conklin ([[Peter Berg]]), back in his amateur days. The Sultan and his unethical crew (which contains actors [[Cheech Marin]], [[Jon Lovitz]], [[Salli Richardson]] and [[Corbin Bernsen]]) find Conklin in [[Cleveland]], where he fronts a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band, advocates peace and [[Buddhism]], and constantly preaches progressive social issues. Conklin is uninterested in returning to boxing to face Roper, though he is eventually coaxed through ego-stroking by the Sultan and a promise of $10 million to help his quest in eradicating homelessness.  Conklin arrives in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], where he is "cleaned up," and starts to train for his return to the ring. Thanks to shady dealing, Conklin suddenly is named the No. 8 challenger in the world. Boxing pundits (including [[Bert Sugar]] who portrays himself in the film) and officials easily see the scam unfolding and label the fight a disgrace. No matter, though, as the prospect of a white vs. black fight appears to be as lucrative as first hoped. Conklin gets in shape quickly, regaining some of his old form, while Roper dismisses the fight as a joke - to the point where he puts on 25 pounds and is barely able to run after an ice cream truck.  Meanwhile, crusading television journalist Mitchell Kane ([[Jeff Goldblum]]) has finally gathered enough evidence to disgrace the unethical Sultan, but at the last moment, Kane is seduced by power and joins the Sultan's squad. As the Sultan's ego grows, Kane sees an opportunity to usurp him in power. Though Conklin was never believed to stand a chance in the fight, Kane recognizes that Conklin may actually win, and has Conklin sign with him, rather than the Sultan. Throughout all this, the true top contender to the heavyweight title, Marvin Shabazz ([[Michael Jace]]), and his manager Hassan El Ruk'n ([[Jamie Foxx]]) are repeatedly denied the rightful chance to a fight, and they proceed to cause a headache for everyone involved in the hype scam.  The Sultan and his crew (using the media) heavily promote the fight and publicize the white vs. black angle, even fabricating an [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestor for Conklin. The racial angle works, and money starts to pour in. On the fight day, millions tune into [[Pay-Per-View]] for the fight, and Kane is confident about a new era beginning with a Conklin upset. The fight begins, and Conklin gets in only one good punch before the out-of-shape Roper easily dispatches his foe - which was the plan all along. Conklin quits boxing again; Kane's plan falls short; the Sultan cleans up financially; Roper's critics are silenced; and Shabazz, refusing to wait any longer, attacks the champ inside the ring. As the two fistfight, the Sultan screams to not give away something they can sell.  Shabazz then knocks out Roper during their ongoing melee inside the ring. Sultan then proceeds to step over Roper's unconscious body and promotes the next fight; Shabazz vs Roper.

Happy Gilmore
  Happy Gilmore is an aspiring ice hockey player who lacks on-ice skills, other than a powerful [[slapshot]]. After another failed hockey tryout, Happy's girlfriend leaves him because of his hockey obsession and lack of success.  Gilmore's grandmother hasn't paid her taxes for years, and owes [[Internal Revenue Service|the IRS]] $270,000 in back taxes. The IRS repossesses her home and intends to auction it off in 90 days unless she can repay the full amount. While repossessing Grandma's furniture, two movers challenge Gilmore to a long-drive contest using his grandfather's old golf clubs. With an unorthodox, [[slapshot]]-style swing, Gilmore hits a ball that strikes a house some 400 yards away, winning $40 after the movers bet he cannot do it again. As a result, he starts hustling golfers at the driving range. There, he meets Chubbs Peterson, a club pro and former golf star, who lost his right hand after an alligator attack. Chubbs convinces Gilmore to enter a local tournament to earn a spot on the [[PGA Tour|Pro Golf Tour]]. Gilmore, desperate to get his grandmother's house back, accepts after Chubbs informs him of the significant prize money involved. Gilmore wins the tournament and a spot on the tour. He quickly becomes a fan-favorite due to his long drives and unorthodox antics, like asking fans to cheer instead of staying quiet, and hiring a homeless man named Otto as his caddie.  Gilmore meets Shooter McGavin, who sees him as a detriment to golf's [[Golf etiquette|etiquette]]. Though Gilmore has a powerful drive, his [[Stroke mechanics (golf)#Putt|putting]] is terrible, and his outbursts along with a lack of etiquette draw the attention of Tour Commissioner Doug Thompson, who tries to expel him from the tour. However, public relations head Virginia Venit convinces Thompson to reconsider, citing higher TV ratings, attendance, drawing more youthful sponsors, and offers to work on Gilmore's anger issues.  Gilmore begins to improve his performance and behavior due to Virginia's influence. During a [[pro-am]] tournament, in which he is partnered with [[Bob Barker]], Gilmore plays poorly due to the heckling of Donald, who was hired by Shooter. Gilmore and Barker get into a fist fight and, as a result, Gilmore is suspended from the tour for one month and fined $25,000.  Virginia secures Gilmore an endorsement deal with [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], allowing him to earn the remaining money needed to take back his grandmother's foreclosed house. However, when Gilmore and the others arrive at the house for the auction, Shooter spitefully outbids Gilmore for the house and offers it to Gilmore — if he quits golf. Gilmore initially accepts, but Virginia talks him out of it, telling him that his grandmother would rather see Gilmore be successful rather than have her house back. Gilmore makes a wager with Shooter for the upcoming [[Tour Championship]]: If Gilmore wins, Shooter will return the house, but if Shooter wins, Gilmore will quit the tour.  In order to improve his short game, Gilmore seeks out Chubbs, and the two head to a [[miniature golf]] course to practice putting. Gilmore improves and presents Chubbs with a gift: the head of the alligator that bit his hand off. Chubbs is startled by the head and falls out an open window to his death.  Now determined to win for both Chubbs and his grandmother, Gilmore plays well, and leads Shooter by the end of the third round. On the fourth and final day, Gilmore seems unstoppable until Donald hits him with a car. Gilmore loses his long-drive ability, and Shooter takes the lead. However, with Virginia's encouragement, Gilmore pushes through and pulls even with Shooter.  On the 18th hole, a TV tower that was hit by Donald's car earlier falls over, blocking the green. Just as he did at the mini golf course with Chubbs, Gilmore sinks a miraculous trick shot, winning the tournament. A distraught Shooter attempts to steal the winner's gold jacket, but he is tracked down, and beaten up by Mr. Larson, Gilmore's imposing ex-boss, and a mob of fans. With his grandmother's house recovered, Happy sees a vision of a two-handed Chubbs, [[Abraham Lincoln]], and the alligator and waves to them as Gilmore's grandmother, Virginia, and Otto look on in confusion.

Head Above Water
  Nathalie's considerably older husband George ([[Harvey Keitel]]) is a stern and prominent judge whose only weak spot is Nathalie herself. The two are happily married and enjoying their beach vacation. Their nearest neighbor, Lance ([[Craig Sheffer]]), is attractive and lively and has a childhood history with Nathalie. To Nathalie's dismay and chagrin, George ventures on an overnight fishing trip with Lance to clear the air between them.  Nathalie's initial reluctance is due to her fear of being left to her own devices (of which the true reason is later learned). Anxious and longing for her husband, she receives an unexpected visit from an old lover named Kent ([[Billy Zane]]). Seizing her chance for company that night, she welcomes him inside and the two reminisce on old times. Kent reveals that his girlfriend recently left him because of his drinking problem; it is revealed that he has a medical condition which is worsened by [[alcohol]]. While Nathalie is in the bathroom, Kent takes it upon himself to grab a bottle of liquor from her husband George’s supply. The two whimsically frolic all night and the scene ends with them exhausted by the night’s activities. Come morning, Nathalie discovers Kent dead, apparently from [[alcohol poisoning]].  Panicked and terrified, Nathalie quickly stores Kent’s naked lifeless body in a food cellar under the floorboard. When George returns from his fishing trip, she tries her best to conceal the night’s events and act normal. As the two talk, George notices the loose floorboard that is situated under the dining table. This is where the food cellar is located and Kent’s head is making the floorboard protrude outward. George stomps on the floorboard and corrects the problem. As Nathalie’s panic grows more desperate, George finds flowers and chocolate that Kent gave to Nathalie that night. Questioning her, Nathalie admits to Kent being present in the house the night of his fishing trip. When she reveals his location, George, believing him to be still alive, taunts him. When Nathalie reveals that he is dead, George comes to understand the true desperation of the situation. Taking his body to the nearby tool shed they debate over what course of action to take. The situation is further complicated because Kent’s clothes are missing and his neck was broken by George stomping on the cellar door. George's being a prominent judge and Nathalie's history (as it is now revealed) of early legal trouble for a pill addiction leave them little legal option but to dispose of the body themselves. Although Nathalie still insists that the authorities should be notified and the situation explained, George insists that it is not possible.  The two decide to dispose of his body in the ocean by tying him down with an old stove. As the two are carrying it to the house, Lance inadvertently shows up and foils their plan and the two are forced to rethink their original strategy. Nathalie and George return home and get into a heated argument. Nathalie expresses her disdain over George’s annoying ability to strangely store items in unconventional places, such as storing sausages in a cigar box. When George questions how Kent could have possibly died, Nathalie mentions his “weak heart” and the fact that he was drinking from George’s personal liquor supply. George reveals that “the blue liquor bottle” which Kent drank was in actuality not (ethyl) alcohol but methanol (methyl alcohol) which is poisonous. Kent’s heart problems along with the disguised powerful liquid drug led to his death. As the two leave each other in frustration over not having disposed of the body, Nathalie goes out for a swim.  Coming back from her swim Nathalie notices Kent’s white linen suit resting on the porch of Lance’s house. Seeing her opportunity to do the right thing, she insists for the suit to which Lance happily agrees. Believing her troubles are over, Nathalie goes in search of George to reveal the good news to therefore dress Kent and explain their situation to the police. Nathalie spots George on the veranda. She sees blood embedded in the newly constructed concrete steps. It is revealed that George cut Kent’s body into pieces and mixed them in with the concrete steps. Horrified, Nathalie runs but is quickly captured by George. Having taken her back to the house and tied her up and gagged her so she can’t escape, George goes out to finish the rest of the work. Nathalie manages to free herself only to take refuge with Lance. She explains the situation and is relieved by Lance’s calm demeanor and support. The two are noticeably smitten by each other and it can be seen that Lance never really stopped loving Nathalie all those years. As Nathalie is in the house she notices a postcard intended for her. Lance says he meant to give it to her but forgot and insists he hasn’t read it. The postcard was in fact the very same one of which Kent spoke of foretelling his visit.  Nathalie quickly concludes that Lance knew Kent was coming all along and spiked George’s liquor supply in order to kill him. Horrified, she runs to George, believing him to be an innocent victim in Lance’s murder plot. Lance, insisting upon his innocence, follows Nathalie outside to the beach. Shockingly, as Lance and Nathalie are confronted by George, the situation ends in a shootout in which George shoots Lance. Nathalie runs but is captured by George soon thereafter. George has been drinking heavily and is completely disoriented but manages to take Nathalie to the veranda and cement her legs shut in a metal crate. Finally revealing that he was in actuality behind the whole ordeal, George explains that he knew Kent was coming that night from the postcard he purposefully placed in Lance’s mailbox to frame him and keep Nathalie from knowing about Kent’s visit. He spiked the liquor before the trip, knowing Kent would drink it and die. Afterward, George starts to have trouble walking and says that he can't see. Nathalie realizes that George has unknowingly drunk the spiked liquor, that Lance had borrowed it earlier, and that Kent really did die of a heart attack. George then falls off the high rise veranda and is killed when the top of it falls down and pierces his body straight through. As a [[domino effect]], Nathalie is thrown into the water but is unable to surface due to her cemented legs in the metal crate. Luckily, there is a local beach patrol boat nearby and Nathalie is rescued.  The scene ends with Nathalie in her own boat telling the beach patrolman her story from the very beginning. The patrolman, behind her, asks for a beverage, and Nathalie tells him to check in the cooler under the seat. Unbeknownst to Nathalie, George had spiked a water bottle previously with Nathalie's medication and put it in the cooler that the patrolman is about to drink.

Heavy Weather (film)
 Though abridged for a 90-minute film, ''Heavy Weather'' follows closely the novel of 1933, the fourth in the Blandings series. Many of the familiar elements of the Blandings books are present: the wish of [[Lord Emsworth]]'s nephew, Ronnie Fish, to marry a chorus girl, Sue Brown; the concern of Emsworth's sisters, the imperious [[Lady Constance Keeble]] and Ronnie's mother Lady Julia Fish, to ensure that the reminiscences of their other brother, the Hon. [[Galahad Threepwood]], were not published; Galahad's protectiveness towards Miss Brown, the daughter of his long lost love Dolly Henderson; the sustained efforts of the publisher [[George Alexander Pyke, Lord Tilbury|Lord Tilbury]] (a character probably based on [[Lord Northcliffe]]) to gain possession of the reminiscences; Lord Emsworth's determination that his prize Berkshire pig, the [[Empress of Blandings]], should win the silver medal in the fat pigs class at the [[Shrewsbury]] agricultural show; Lord Emsworth's employment of a private detective, [[Percy Frobisher Pilbeam|P. Frobisher Pilbeam]], to protect the Empress and his rivalry with his neighbour, [[Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe|Sir Gregory Parsloe]],<ref>Sir Gregory's full surname was Parsloe-Parsloe, though this was never revealed in the television drama and Wodehouse usually wrote the name simply as "Parsloe".</ref> of Matchingham Hall, who had not only his own designs on the fat pigs class, but, as a prospective [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Parliamentary]] candidate, an interest in suppressing Galahad's reminiscences; and the employment as Lord Emsworth's secretary of [[Monty Bodkin]], who, as with most holders of that office, had an ulterior motive (in this instance, the need to hold down paid employment for a year in order to be considered suitable to marry one Gertrude Butterwick).  
Harriet the Spy (film)
 Harriet M. Welsch ([[Michelle Trachtenberg]]) is an 11-year-old [[sixth grade]]r and a young spy/writer who is best friends with Simon "Sport" Rocque ([[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]]) and Janie Gibbs ([[Vanessa Lee Chester]]). She lives a privileged life with her parents, Violetta and Ben and her [[nanny]], Katherine "Ole Golly" ([[Rosie O'Donnell]]), who's the only person who knows all the things that Harriet has been snooping on. Harriet and her friends are enemies with a rich girl named Marion Hawthorne ([[Charlotte Sullivan]]). For a while, Harriet lives life very well with being a spy and having fun with Golly.  One night, being home alone with Harriet, Golly invites a friend, Mr. George Waldenstein, over. And after Golly accidentally burns their dinner, the three go out to dinner and a movie instead, where things turn into a disaster. Violetta fires Golly for letting Harriet stay out late, but then she realizes that she still needs her to look after Harriet and begs her to stay. Golly tells her, however, that she was planning to leave soon since she thinks that Harriet is old enough to take care of herself, much to everyone's protests. Shortly before she leaves, Golly encourages Harriet to never give up on her love for observing people just because she will no longer be with her, and promises her that she will be the first to buy her very own autographed copy of Harriet's first novel she sells in the future. After Harriet bids Golly goodbye, she becomes depressed and withdrawn. She even gets caught when investigating the home of Agatha K. Plummer ([[Eartha Kitt]]).  The next day, she plays with her friends at the park, and disaster strikes. Marion discovers Harriet's private notebook and begins reading all of Harriet's vindictive comments on her friends out loud, such as how she suspects Janie "will grow up to be a nutcase", and teasing Sport's father for barely earning any money. Everyone finds that they are all cruel and hurtful, and even Sport and Janie turn their backs on Harriet. The kids then create a Spy-Catcher club and torment Harriet on her spy routes.    After running into a police officer, and then getting zeroes on her schoolwork, Harriet gets her notebook taken away by her parents. Her parents request that Harriet's teacher Miss Elson (Nancy Beatty) search Harriet every day for notebooks, much to Harriet's embarrassment. One day, during art, Rachel Hennessey "accidentally" pours blue paint all over Harriet. Harriet quickly realizes the act was intentional, having seen the girls whispering about the plot minutes before it occurred. After Marion purposefully pours a full can of blue paint on Harriet's head, Harriet slaps her and runs out of the school. As a result of this, Harriet does things to get back at everyone individually, then exposes to them that Marion's father left her because he never loved her. She then carries out some of her other plans, including cutting off a chunk of Laura's hair, sabotaging one of Janie's science experiments, triggering an angry response from Janie's parents, and humiliating Sport with a fake picture of him in a maid outfit. Harriet's revenge plans enrage her classmates, further increasing their hatred for Harriet.  Harriet's parents discover what she has done to her classmates and send her to be evaluated by a psychologist, who assures them that Harriet is fine. Then things start to get better again. Harriet gets her notebook back, and she even gets a surprise visit from Golly, who tells her that in order to make things right again, she must do two things: apologize and lie. When Harriet tells her that it's not worth it, Golly disagrees, and tells Harriet that she is worth it as an individual, and her being an individual will make others nervous (and keep making them feel as such), before finally adding that one of the blessings of life is good friends, and tells Harriet to never give up her friends without a fight.  Harriet then tries to apologize to Sport and Janie, even though they initially reject her (they later, however, get tired of being treated unfairly in Marion's bully group and quit). She also shares her opinion with Miss Elson about how getting appointed as the editor of the sixth grade paper was being done in an unfair manner, and she get selected herself by her classmates, who get Marion's occupation as the editor voted out. Through one article, she apologizes to everyone, including Marion, and all (except Marion) accept her apology. All is well. On opening night of the 6th grade pageant, Janie, Sport, and Harriet light off a stink bomb as revenge on Marion and dance to [[James Brown]]'s "[[Get Up Offa That Thing]]" until the end of the film.  
Head of the Family
 Howard (Gordon Jennison Noice) is the meanest nastiest thug in town, a [[Harley-Davidson|Harley]] riding criminal with a hot wife Loretta (Jacqueline Lovell). Loretta's problem is she's having an affair with Lance (Blake Adams), owner of the town diner and Howard’s getting suspicious. Driving back from one of their nightly flings, Lance witnesses the local family of weirdos, the Stackpools, dragging a man from his truck and into their house. Seeing this as an opportunity, Lance discovers the Stackpools terrible secret. They are [[multiple birth|quintuplets]] but instead of being born as a normal human, they each have one of the traits of one human being: One is extremely strong; one has extremely well-developed senses; one is extremely attractive ([[Alexandria Quinn]]); and, one is extremely intelligent. The whole family is run by the one who has super intelligence, the 'head of the family' from the title, Myron (J.W. Perra). Little more than a giant head with hands in a wheelchair, Myron psychically controls his other siblings, but seeks more. When idiotic locals fall for his trap, he experiments on their brains, trying to find a normal body to house his superior intellect. Lance blackmails the Stackpools with their secret, getting them to kill Howard and demanding $2,000 a week in cash. (The Stackpools are rich in oil and coal among other things) Eventually Myron tires of Lance's bottom-feeding, and captures him and Loretta, to get them to destroy the evidence of their secret. To force Lance's hand, he puts Loretta in a mock play of [[Joan of Arc]] in the basement, complete with a [[burning at the stake]]. The dumb strong one, seeing the 'pretty girl' in trouble, carries her off before she can be hurt, and burns the house down. With the Stackpools and Lance dead, the ever scheming Loretta realizes that the big dumb one is the heir to the family riches. She marries him inheriting all the Stackpool fortunes.  The ending, however, suggests that Myron is still alive and is controlling the dumb one again....

Hellraiser: Bloodline
 In 2127, Dr. Paul Merchant, an engineer, seals himself in a room aboard The Minos, a [[space station]] that he designed. As armed guards attempt to break through the door, Merchant manipulates a robot into solving the [[Lemarchand's box|Lament Configuration]], destroying the robot in the process. The guards break through the door and apprehend Merchant, who agrees to explain his motivations to their leader, Rimmer.  The film flashes back to Paris, France, 1796. Dr. Merchant's ancestor, Phillip LeMarchand, a French toymaker, makes the Lament Configuration on commission from the [[libertine]] aristocrat Duc de L'Isle. Unbeknownst to LeMarchand, L'Isle's specifications for the box make it a portal to [[Hell]]. Upon delivering the box to L'Isle, LeMarchand watches as he and his assistant Jacques sacrifice a peasant girl and use her blood to summon a demon, Angelique, through the box. LeMarchand runs home in terror, where he begins working on blueprints for a second box which will neutralize the effects of the first. Returning to L'Isle's mansion to steal the box, LeMarchand discovers that Jacques has killed L'Isle and taken control over Angelique, who agrees to be his slave so long as he does not impede the wishes of Hell. The pair kill LeMarchand, and Jacques informs him that his bloodline is now cursed for helping to open a portal to Hell.  In 1996, LeMarchand's descendant, John Merchant, has built a skyscraper in Manhattan that resembles the Lament Configuration. Seeing an article on the building in a magazine, Angelique asks Jacques to take her to America so that she can confront him. When Jacques denies her request, Angelique kills him, as Merchant poses a threat to Hell. Angelique travels to America, where she fails to seduce Merchant. Discovering the Lament Configuration in the building's foundation, Angelique tricks a security guard into solving it, which summons [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]]. The two immediately clash, as Pinhead represents a shift in the ideologies of Hell, which she left behind two hundred years ago: while Angelique believes in corrupting people through temptation, Pinhead is fanatically devoted to pain and suffering. Despite their conflicting views, the pair forge an uneasy alliance to kill Merchant before he can complete The Elysium Configuration, an anti-Lament Configuration that creates perpetual light and would serve to permanently close all gateways to Hell.  Angelique and Pinhead initially collaborate to corrupt Merchant, but Pinhead grows tired of Angelique's seductive techniques and threatens to kill Merchant's wife and child. Having grown accustomed to a decadent life on Earth, Angelique wants no part of Hell's new fanatical austerity, and she intends to force Merchant to activate the Elysium Configuration and destroy Hell, thus freeing her from its imperatives. However, Merchant's flawed prototype fails. Pinhead kills Merchant, but his wife opens Angelique's Lament Configuration, sending Pinhead and Angelique back to Hell.  In 2127, Rimmer disbelieves Dr. Merchant's story and has him locked away. However, Pinhead and his followers—now including an enslaved Angelique—have already been freed after Merchant opened the box. Upon learning of Dr. Merchant's intentions, they kill the entire crew of the ship, save for Rimmer and Paul, who escape. Paul reveals that the Minos is, in fact, the final, perfected form of the Elysium Configuration, and that by activating it, he can kill Pinhead and permanently seal the gateway to Hell.  Paul distracts Pinhead with a hologram while he boards an escape pod with Rimmer. Once clear of the station, he activates the Elysium Configuration. A series of powerful lasers and mirrors create a field of perpetual light, while the station transforms and folds around the light to create a massive box. The light is trapped within the box, killing Pinhead and his followers, thus ending Pinhead's existence, this time, permanently.

It's three stories with a [[swimming pool]] and expensive furniture. Robbie is hiding in a tree across the street watching his sister. He is supposed to pick up Willa but he waits until after the Millerton's let Willa eat dinner with them before he knocks on the door.   Bill takes Willa to the clinic because her coughing and headaches are getting worse. Bill wants to know what's wrong with her but Michael refuses to tell him anything until the results of the tests come back.  While grocery shopping, the kids scarf down as many free samples as they can until the employee tells them that the samples are just incentives for people to buy. Robbie pretends he's going to buy some but then leaves them on a shelf when he walks away. When they check out Bill doesn't have enough money to pay for all the groceries so he's forced to put some back.  At this point Robbie starts skipping school to find ways to earn money. At first he helps people bring their groceries to their car and then he walks through the park looking for cans and bottles to recycle. Eventually he comes across a [[mechanic]] named Gus whom he develops a friendship with.   At Caroline's house while playing make-believe, Willa steals some food from the Millerton's pantry and hides it in her school bag. Caroline's mother notices but doesn't confront her about it because she doesn't know what to say. Feeling bad, however, she gives Willa a bag of [[apple]]s when she's about to leave to take home with her.  Bill has to work a double shift at the fast food restaurant so he's not able to bring Willa to her doctor's appointment. Michael meets Bill at work to give him an update on Willa. He says that Willa's [[immune system]] is weak because she's not getting enough [[iron]]. He tells Bill that Willa is now at the age when any period of time without adequate [[nutrition]] can have long lasting implications that she can't make up for.  Bill goes for a job interview for a [[busboy]] at a fancy restaurant. The manager hires him and says he can start on Monday. He's so happy that he quits his job at the fast food restaurant and tells Willa she can invite Caroline over for dinner. However, before he's able to start his new job he finds out that the owner replaced him with his nephew. Bill is pissed off now because he's unemployed and he spent a bunch of money for clothes that he doesn't need anymore. At home Caroline witnesses Bill fly into a rage throwing furniture. When Michael comes to pick her up he hears about Bill's latest string of bad luck and invites him over for dinner on Sunday. Bill refuses and says, "I can't digest charity food."  The next day Bill finds a job at a car wash through a [[temp agency]]. He comes home to a house with no food and changes his mind about the [[barbecue]] at the Millerton's. It turns out to be a little awkward because Caroline's grandparents and the Januson's don't have anything in common. Willa and Caroline are the only two people who seem to be perfectly comfortable with each other. Bill confides in Michael that before coming there his family hadn't eaten in more than a day.   That night, Willa's health starts getting much worse. She cries and coughs all night. The only thing that Bill can do to make her feel better is to sing her a [[lullaby]].  Finally realizing he has no choice, he breaks down and for the first time goes to apply for [[Food Stamp Program|food stamps]]. He spends all day at the "North Seattle Food Bank" being shuffled from one line to another until they tell him that the earliest he can receive assistance will be in 5 days.  At the auto shop, Gus tells Robbie that the car they've been trying to fix is almost done except that it needs a new [[carburetor]]. Robbie runs home to get some money so he can buy it. He takes the money Bill was saving for rent that he had kept hidden. While there he gets caught by his father, and they have another big fight. Bill finds out that Robbie has been skipping school for 3 weeks but he doesn't find out about the money. Robbie tells him, "a man's not a man unless he pulls his weight" and reminds Bill about something that he said earlier, that he is "just another mouth to feed". He tells Robbie to go back to school but instead Robbie buys the part that he needs, and takes it to Gus. The next day she tells him that she found a buyer willing to pay $1,855 for the car and that she's willing to split it with him because of all the help that he has given her.    Bill happens to walk by a [[construction site]] and feeling desperate he joins in and starts working. Even though he wasn't hired, they let him work because they need the help. By the end of the day the supervisor decides to hire him after seeing what a hard worker he is.  Meanwhile, Robbie goes to see Gus and finds that the car isn't there. Unfortunately she wasn't able to sell it. Angela, a girl who works with her, borrowed the car the night before to see her boyfriend and ended up in a [[car accident]]. Gus tries to explain to him that it's not the end of the world, but she doesn't know the situation that he is in.  When he gets home Willa tries to console him seeing that he's very upset. Robbie just ignores her, so she goes outside. Thinking that there is no more hope, Robbie trashes the [[time capsule]] that he's been making and then writes on the bathroom mirror, "one less mouth to feed". He steps into the shower, takes off his belt and ties it to the showerhead.   When Bill returns home he finds Willa waiting for him on the outside steps. He is excited to tell her and Robbie about his new job as a construction worker. They go inside to find Robbie passed out in the bathtub. The showerhead had broken.   At the hospital Robbie wakes up and confesses to his father about stealing the money. Bill is just happy to see that Robbie will be alright. Later, we see Willa and Caroline playing in a park. Caroline notices that Willa is sad but tries to pretend like nothing is wrong. Playfully, she starts tossing flower petals at Willa but she is too tired to play along.   ===Closing caption=== The credits end with the following caption:   
Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Part II
 Serial killer Henry continues his killing spree when he takes a job at a port-o-john company where he meets two employees, Kai and his wife Cricket. They take pity on Henry when they learn that he is a homeless drifter and offer him a room in their home. Also staying with them is Kai and Cricket's emotionally fragile teenage niece, Louisa. Henry learns that Kai has a side job as an arsonist-for-hire, setting up phony insurance scams to make money for their boss, Rooter. Henry agrees to join Kai and on one of their first outings, they discover two squatters in a building that's been marked for fire. It is then that Henry introduces Kai to his life's work of being a serial killer... and the murders begin. Kai has never killed before, but he turns into a willing accomplice. Initially, the two men work well together. But as the killing sprees increase in their depravity, it's more than Kai can handle. He wants out, but he's in too deep with both his insurance scam with Rooter as well as being a murder accomplice with Henry.  In the meantime, Louisa develops a romantic crush on Henry, but he refuses to respond to her sexual advances. After Henry rejects Louisa's advances, she becomes more dangerously disturbed and suicidal.  When Henry attends a gathering with Kai and Cricket at Rooter's house, he refuses to take recreational drugs until Rooter slips Henry a roofie in his drink, Henry passes out and wakes up later after the other guests leave. Angry that Rooter drugged him, Henry murders Rooter on the spur of the moment as well as his friend, which is against Henry's "code" never to murder people that he knows personally. Kai helps Henry dispose of the two bodies with Cricket finally seeing the side work that Henry and Kai have been doing. When the three of them return at Kai and Cricket's house, they find Louisa who kills herself in front of them. Again on the spur of the moment, Henry takes the gun that Louisa used to kill herself and shoots both Kai and Cricket. Cricket dies while Kai is critically wounded. Henry takes the bodies to the basement of the house, pours gasoline all over the place and sets fire to the house allowing Kai to burn to death. Henry gets into Kai and Cricket's car and drives away into the night, alone once again to continue his killing spree as the house explodes and burns to the ground, again leaving no trace for the police to learn about Henry's existence. These events depicted in this movie bare no truth to actual events in Lucas's life only a small plot that involves the character Louisa bares a small resemblance to an actual person but the events depicted in this movie alters them quit a bit.  
High School High
  Richard Clark ([[Jon Lovitz]]) is an unsatisfied prep school teacher at the fictional Wellington Academy, who accepts a job at inner city [[Marion Barry]] High School, much to the chagrin of his boss and father, Wellington headmaster Thaddeus Clark ([[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]]). Richard arrives to find the school in a state of disarray and disorder, while meeting several students and faculty members, including jaded, sour principal Evelyn Doyle ([[Louise Fletcher]]), her cheerful assistant Victoria Chappell ([[Tia Carrere]]) and student Griff McReynolds ([[Mekhi Phifer]]).  Despite initial opposition to his teaching style and harassment from the school gang leader Paco ([[Guillermo Díaz (actor)|Guillermo Díaz]]), Richard begins connecting with his students and teaches them effectively, while developing a romantic relationship with Victoria. Barry High eventually is transformed into a fine educational establishment. Frustrated, Paco and his gang tamper with the school's final exam scores, causing everyone to fail. Griff, who grew to see Richard as a mentor, loses faith in him, as does the rest of the school and Richard is fired. Griff subsequently joins Paco's gang to make extra money.  Victoria learns through word of mouth that Paco was behind the failing test scores and rushes to inform Richard, who decides to confront Paco and rescue Griff with the help of several of his students, including Anferny Jefferson ([[Brian Hooks]]), Natalie Thompson ([[Malinda Williams]]) and Julie Rubels ([[Natasha Gregson Wagner]]). By deceiving Mr. DeMarco ([[Marco Rodríguez (actor)|Marco Rodríguez]]), a local gangster, Richard and Victoria reach Paco and the local crime boss, "Mr. A", whom they find has been Principal Doyle the entire time.

Hitler (1996 film)
 The movie speaks about the life of Madhavankutty ([[Mammootty]]), a rich man locally known as "Hitler" due to his tough character, domineering personality and his uncontrolled rage at the youngsters of the area, for stalking his five young sisters. Even though he loves his family more than anything in this world, he fails to express his love. He had been looking after the family since the death of their mother. Their father Pillechan ([[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]]) is married again with two daughters and his children from the first marriage do not even speak with him (Madhavankutty's uncle Gangadhara Menon is responsible for the separation between the children and Pillechan, which is revealed in a later part of the story). Madhavankutty's marriage was fixed with his cousin Gauri ([[Shobana Chandrakumar|Shobhana]]) and his sister Ammu’s ([[Vani Viswanath]]) marriage with Gauri's brother Balachandran ([[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]]). Once in Madhavankutty's absence, Balachandran sneaked in to his house to be with Ammu, but get caught which results in hostility between the two families and Madhavankutty opposes any of the decided marriages to happen between the families. Balachandran on the other hand wants to make them happen.  Things change when the eldest sister Seetha goes through an unfortunate event, where her unmarried professor ([[M. G. Soman]]) under the influence, rapes her. Coming back to senses, the professor confesses his act to Madhavankutty. Devastated on hearing this and learning how this incident can affect the lives of his younger sisters, he is forced to go with the solution that the professor puts forward. He gets Seetha married to the professor. His sister Ammu unaware of the facts behind the marriage gets furious with him, while he, being inherently stoic, behaved as a rude dominant to hide the facts. Balachandran finds this as an opportunity to get Ammu, who otherwise wouldn’t do anything against her brother’s wishes. Balachandran and Ammu get married and settle in the neighborhood.  Due to the new developments, Madhavankutty's uncle Gangadhara Menon ([[Kozhikode Narayanan Nair]]) tries to befriend their rival family – Kompara. They on the other hand were waiting for an opportunity to take revenge, pretend to offer help, while their real intention was to increase the hatred between Madhavankutty and his uncle as they see Madhavankutty as a threat and can never do anything unless they remain enemies. They also suggest a marriage alliance with Gauri, which Gangadhara Menon approves. Gauri, still in love with Madhavankutty, acts pregnant saying Madhavankutty as the one responsible for it to prevent the marriage. This agitates Gangadhara Menon and under the advice of Nandakumar (from Kompara family), he decides to destroy the lives of Madhavankutty’s sisters, the way he destroyed Gauri's life. Madhavankutty's father learns about the plot and foils them, but it causes the girls and him to end up in the police station. He fails to convince his son about the truth and they become angrier at their father for his behavior. Nandakumar ([[Saikumar (Malayalam actor)|Saikumar]]) sees the opportunity and they murder Pillechan. Madhavankutty, even though angry at his father’s deeds, does not desert his half sisters and brings them home, much to the dismay of his sisters who have an argument with him and leaves to Ammu's home to stay. Balachandran realizes the seriousness of the situation and asks the girls to go back to their brother. He also say that whatever he did, was for Madhavankutty to stop sacrificing his life for his sisters and to get him married to his sister who loves him for life. Balachandran goes to find Madhavankutty to apologize, but gets attacked by a gang of thugs under the command of a person, seemingly Madhavankutty, while it actually was Krishnanunni the eldest of Kompara family who framed him. Balachandran survives and thinks Madhavankutty did it, which causes everyone, even Gauri to turn against him. Gangadhara Menon along with the ones from Kompara family goes to finish Madhavankutty once and for all, but learns that he himself was the target and Balachandran was not attacked by Madhavankutty. They try to murder Menon thinking after all that has happened Madhavankutty will not dare rescue him, but to their surprise he shows up to save Menon. Wounded Menon at the hospital tells to the rest of the family about his nephew's innocence. Madhavankutty survives the attack and succeeds in getting rid of the Kompara family from their lives. Losing hope at everything he believes, he decides to leave all behind and go someplace. He does not listen to the apologies or requests of the sisters to stay. He asks Balachandran to take care of the sisters and to find a better person for Gauri as he will never be a good husband for her. He begins to leave while a youngster shows up staring at his sisters leading him to chase the one, indicating that he can't stop being himself and can never leave.

 The owners of Shadow the [[Golden Retriever]] (voiced by [[Ralph Waite]]), Sassy the [[Himalayan (cat)|Himalayan cat]] ([[Sally Field]]), and Chance the [[American Bulldog]] ([[Michael J. Fox]]) decide to take a family trip to Canada. At the [[San Francisco International Airport]], the animals escape after Chance panics with mistaking airport workers as the workers at the pound ("The Bad Place" as Chance puts it), due to how some of his actions earlier angered Jamie, making Chance believe Jamie was so mad at him he was going to send him back to the pound, and breaks free from his carrier. After eluding airport authorities, the animals find themselves in the city of San Francisco, with home on the other side of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]].  During the journey, Chance bumps into a [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]] called Ashcan and his [[Bullmastiff]] friend Pete. Annoyed, he refuses to let them past, but Shadow tries to tell them they are just trying to get home. They do not listen and say they are going to eat Sassy. She hides on a window sill and Shadow and Ashcan fight. After a few seconds, Sassy yells to Shadow that they have reinforcements, but it turns out to be, as Pete calls them, "Riley's gang". They help them, saying that the city is not a place for pets. Shadow explains they are lost and Riley points out that Chance is missing, who fled as the gang arrived. Riley calls his friend Delilah, a [[Kuvasz]], to run after him. She finds him in a light alley and explains why she was chasing him.  As the other members of the gang are walking down the street, they see, what they call, the "Blood Red Van" and hide. Shadow asks what it is for and Riley explains it takes dogs of the streets to a place called the [[Laboratory|lab]]. After it passes, Shadow asks Riley if he can help him and Sassy find a golden bridge, which he remembers passing on the way there. Riley explains that he could not because a bridge means cars, and cars means humans, and he does not trust humans. So they thank him for his help and head off to look for the bridge themselves. Meanwhile, Delilah and Chance are walking in the park. He explains why they are in the city, and when he asks her why Riley does not like humans she explains that he was abandoned as a puppy and decided to make a home for other stray dogs to protect them from all humans. Chance realizes he has fallen in love with Delilah and they head out of the park.  Later, while walking down a street, Pete and Ashcan notice Shadow and Sassy walking down it too. They plan to jump at them but miss their chance. Round the corner, Shadow sees a house on fire and remembers it holds that little boy named Tucker and his cat they met earlier before Chance scared him back inside. Realizing they are still in there after hearing Tucker's parents and the [[San Francisco Fire Department|SFFD]] fire chief preparing to send firefighters in to find him, he runs in through the basement window and looks for them. Sassy goes in after him and looks for the kitten. Shadow comes out a few moments later with Tucker right behind him, then Sassy appears with the kitten. Tucker thanks them and they continue on. As they cross the street, Riley and his gang tell them that they did a great job rescuing the boy and kitten and say they can stay with him until they find Chance.  As they return to the gang's hideout they see Delilah and Chance already there. Riley tries to explain that they are different, but they will not listen and head outside. The next day, Chance sees a tire and begins to chew on it, but does not notice the "Blood Red Van" driving through the gates. While all the other dogs are inside, Chance is captured and is about to be driven to the lab. While driving off, the van is stopped by the gang, Chance and the other dogs are set free, and Bando reverses it into the river after the dogs scare away the drivers. Delilah then explains to Chance that Riley is right and they could not be together. He gets upset and runs off. By this time, Riley has told Shadow if humans mean that much to him he will take them to the bridge.  On their way home, before crossing the bridge, they are ambushed by Ashcan and Pete, but Chance appears and fights them off. They cross the bridge and are found by their owners on a road after Chance is almost run over by a truck. They return home, but Chance is still upset about Delilah, but then he sees her appear from around the corner and they are reunited. Bob agrees she can stay, much to Chance's glee, and they continue with their picnic with Chance hogging the pizza.

The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)
  In 1482 [[Paris]], [[Clopin Trouillefou|Clopin]], a [[Romani people|gypsy]] puppeteer, narrates the origin of the titular [[Kyphosis|hunchback]]. A group of gypsies sneak illegally into Paris, but are ambushed by [[Claude Frollo|Judge Claude Frollo]], the [[Ministry of Justice (France)|Minister of Justice]] of Paris, and his soldiers. A gypsy woman in the group attempts to flee with her deformed baby, but Frollo chases and kills her outside [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]]. He tries to kill the baby as well, but the cathedral's [[archdeacon]] intervenes and accuses Frollo of murdering an innocent woman. To atone for his sin, Frollo reluctantly agrees to raise the deformed child in Notre Dame as his son, naming him "[[Quasimodo]]".  Twenty years later, Quasimodo develops into a kind yet isolated young man who has lived inside the cathedral his entire life. A trio of living stone [[gargoyle]]s—Victor, Hugo, and Laverne—serve as Quasimodo's only company, and encourage him to attend the annually-held [[Feast of Fools|Festival of Fools]]. Despite Frollo's warnings that he would be shunned for his deformity, Quasimodo attends the festival and is celebrated for his awkward appearance, only to be humiliated by the crowd after Frollo's men start a riot. Frollo refuses to help Quasimodo, but [[Esméralda (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame)|Esmeralda]], a kind gypsy, intervenes by freeing the hunchback, and uses a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]] to evade arrest. Frollo confronts Quasimodo and sends him back inside the cathedral.  Esmeralda follows Quasimodo inside, only to be followed herself by [[Captain Phoebus]] of Frollo's guard. Phoebus refuses to arrest her for alleged [[witchcraft]] inside Notre Dame and instead has her confined to the cathedral. Esmeralda finds and befriends Quasimodo, who helps her escape Notre Dame out of gratitude for defending him. She entrusts Quasimodo a pendant containing a map to the gypsies' hideout, the [[Cour des miracles|Court of Miracles]]. Frollo soon develops lustful feelings for Esmeralda and, upon realizing them, begs the [[Virgin Mary]] to save him from her "[[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]" to avoid eternal [[damnation]]. When Frollo discovers that she escaped, he instigates a citywide manhunt for her which involves [[Arson|setting fire to]] countless houses in his way. Phoebus is appalled by Frollo's evil and defies him, and Frollo sentences him to death. While fleeing, Phoebus is struck by an arrow and falls into the [[River Seine]], but Esmeralda rescues him and takes him to Notre Dame for refuge. The gargoyles encourage Quasimodo to confess his feelings for Esmeralda, but he is heartbroken to discover she and Phoebus have fallen in love.  Frollo returns to Notre Dame later that night and discovers that Quasimodo helped Esmeralda escape. He bluffs to Quasimodo, saying that he knows about the Court of Miracles and that he intends to attack at dawn. Using the map Esmeralda gave him, Quasimodo and Phoebus find the court to warn the gypsies, only for Frollo to follow them and capture all the gypsies present. Frollo prepares to burn Esmeralda at the stake after she rejects his advances, but Quasimodo rescues her and brings her to the cathedral. Phoebus releases the gypsies and rallies the citizens of Paris against Frollo and his men, who try to break into the cathedral. Quasimodo and the gargoyles pour molten lead onto the streets to ensure no one enters, but Frollo successfully manages to get inside. He pursues Quasimodo and Esmeralda to the balcony where he and Quasimodo both fall over the edge. Frollo falls to his death in the molten lead, while Quasimodo is caught by Phoebus on a lower floor. Afterward, Quasimodo comes to accept that Phoebus and Esmeralda are in love, and he gives them his blessing. The two encourage him to leave the cathedral into the outside world, where the citizens hail him as a hero and accept him into society.  
The Hunters (1996 film)
  Erik (Rolf Lassgård), a [[Stockholm]] police officer, reunites with his relatives upon the death of his abusive father in [[Norrbotten]], where his brother Leif (Lennart Jähkel) still lives. We learn that the control the father exerted over the family had resulted in Leif's giving up singing (despite being clearly talented), and instead remaining at home with his father.  Suffering from post-traumatic stress after justifiably killing a man while on duty, Erik has been transferred to the local field office. Erik soon starts to suspect that his brother's friends, led by the half-Finnish Tomme ([[Jarmo Mäkinen]]), are involved in large-scale illegal hunting of reindeer and moose. Erik is frustrated by the local police's unwillingness to deal with the problem, but as events unfold he discovers illegal weapons in Tomme's car outside a pub and decides to intervene. Tomme is close to assaulting Erik when he is saved by his brother. It is later revealed that Leif in fact leads the illegal hunting, but has been keeping this a secret from his brother.  The police come under increasing pressure as the local community grows more angry that the poaching case has not been solved. Erik continues to spy on Tomme, and after breaking into his house, discovers illegal guns and numerous animal carcasses. Before Erik can alert his colleagues, he is attacked and knocked unconscious.   Leif decides to suspend operations until further notice because of the increased police interest in the case. Several members of the gang are unhappy about this, as they have taken on large financial commitments such as car loans. Pursuing a big raid to recover the lost income, Tomme accidentally shoots and kills a Russian [[bilberry]] worker. Another bilberry worker witnesses the dumping of the victim's body and car in a lake. Leif chases her and fatally slits her throat. Unaware that the murder of the woman has been seen by Ove, a kind but [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] childhood friend of Erik's, the five men decide to keep silent instead of going to the police.  Erik suspects his brother is hiding something. Erik intervenes when the gang racially and sexually harasses a [[Filipino people|Filipina]] barmaid, Nena, at the local bar. Later, Erik and Nena spend the night together. Erik leaves Nena in the house while he attends a ceremony to receive an award for having returned to his hometown. While Erik is out, Leif and his gang arrive at the house and, after verbally abusing Nena, they rape her on the kitchen table. Nena then disappears, and it is later revealed that she returned to the Philippines. Erik, meanwhile, tries to have Tomme's wife betray her husband and tell him something, but she refuses.   Upon the arrival of a female prosecutor from Stockholm ([[Helena Bergström]]), the body of the Russian woman is found. With information from Ove, the police find the body of the male Russian, with a fragment of the bullet lodged within it. Erik tells Ove to stay inside and keep his door locked, but Leif and the others, having been tipped off by Erik's police partner that Ove is the witness, arrive at Ove's house and take him out in the woods for what they say is a hunting trip but is in fact an execution.   Erik and prosecutor Anna arrive too late, as the gang has "accidentally" shot Ove. A short time before, Erik had found out that Ove was his and Leif's half-brother.  Unable to prove that Ove was murdered, Erik is forced to find the rifle used to shoot the Russian to secure a conviction for this killing. In a final stand-off Erik is fired at and nearly killed by Tomme, but Erik manages to hit Tomme with an iron bar. Tomme is arrested.   Leif gives Erik 200,000 Kronor (which is his share of their father's estate) and asks Erik to let him turn himself in. Erik agrees, giving him one hour to do so and then leaves. Rather than turn himself in, Leif then kills himself by burning the house down. Erik returns to Stockholm, trying to pursue another life than that which his father and his brother had attempted.

Nat insists that Midge stand up for his rights, going so far as to pass himself off as Midge's attorney.  Nat's married daughter, Clara, is concerned about his welfare, particularly given how vulnerable a senior citizen can be in the park. She has good reason to worry because Nat encounters the Cowboy, a drug dealer who is owed money by a young woman named Laurie, and by J.C., a mugger who turns violent when Nat unwisely decides to fight back.  
In Cold Blood (miniseries)
 At the end of the 1950s, in a more innocent America, a brutal, meaningless slaying of a Midwestern family horrifies the nation. While in prison, Dick Hickock, 28, hears a cellmate's story about $10,000 in cash kept in a home safe by a prosperous farmer. When he's paroled, Dick persuades ex-con Perry Smith, 31, to join him in going after the stash.  On a November night in 1959, Dick and Perry break into the Holcomb, Kansas, farm house of Herbert Clutter and family. Enraged at finding no safe, they wake the four sleeping Clutters and brutally kill them all. The bodies are found by friends who come by before Sunday church. The murders shock the small Great Plains town, where doors are routinely left unlocked. Detective Alvin Dewey of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation heads the case, but there are no clues, no apparent motive and no suspects.  
Ilona Arrives with the Rain
      
Independence Day (1996 film)
  On July 2, 1996, an enormous [[Mother ship|alien mothership]], that has one fourth the mass of the Moon, enters orbit around Earth, deploying assault fortress saucers, each fifteen miles wide, that take positions over some of Earth's major cities. David Levinson, an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded in global satellite transmissions that he determines is a timer counting down to a coordinated attack. With the help of his former wife, [[White House Communications Director]] Constance Spano, David, and his father Julius, gain access to the [[Oval Office]] and warn [[President of the United States|President]] Thomas J. Whitmore that the aliens are hostile. Whitmore orders large-scale evacuations of [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Washington, D.C.]], but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the saucers activate devastating [[directed-energy weapon]]s, killing millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons, and a few others narrowly escape aboard [[Air Force One]] as the capital is destroyed, along with the other locations over which the saucers are positioned.  On July 3, international leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their [[military aviation|air forces]] attack the saucers positioned above the ruins of the cities, but the saucers are protected by [[Force field (fiction)|force fields]]. Each saucer launches a swarm of attack fighters, each with its own shield as well, which wipe out the human fighter squadrons and military bases. Captain Steven Hiller, a F/A-18 jet pilot with the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] squadron [[VMFA-314]] based out of [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro]], survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the [[Grand Canyon]] and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the injured alien pilot and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to [[Area 51]], where Whitmore's group has landed. Through [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] Albert Nimzicki, they learn that a faction of the government has been involved in a [[UFO conspiracy theory|UFO conspiracy]] since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell]]. Area 51 houses the refurbished alien fighter, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash.  When eccentric scientist Dr. Brackish Okun examines the alien captured by Steven, it regains consciousness and attacks. It [[Telepathy|telepathically]] invades Dr. Okun's mind and uses his vocal cords to communicate with President Whitmore before launching a psychic attack against him. Whitmore sees visions of the aliens' plans: their entire civilization travels from planet to planet, exterminating all indigenous life and stripping the planet of all natural resources. After [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents and military personnel kill the alien, Whitmore reluctantly authorizes a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]]; a [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] fires a nuclear warhead tipped cruise missile at a saucer positioned above [[Houston]], but the saucer remains intact.  On [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]], David demonstrates that the key to defeating the aliens lies in deactivating their force fields, and devises a way to do so by uploading a [[computer virus]] into the mothership. He proposes using the refurbished alien fighter to implement the plan, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The two are able to upload the virus and [[Nuclear weapons delivery|deploy a nuclear weapon]] on board the mothership, blowing it to pieces. With military pilots in short supply, Whitmore enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, to fly the remaining F/A-18s at Area 51; and leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on the base. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighter jets are able to effectively fight back against the enemy craft, but their supply of missiles is exhausted before they can bring down the ship. As the saucer prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but when the firing control on the missile fails, he bravely [[kamikaze|rams]] his jet into the directed-energy weapon port, causing a chain reaction that destroys the entire ship. Human resistance forces around the world are informed of the alien ships' weak point, and successfully destroy the other saucers. As humankind is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They then accompany Whitmore and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership burn up, resembling a [[fireworks]] display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.  
Intimate Relations (1996 film)
 Marjorie Beaslie (Walters) is a housewife in her forties who takes in a lodger named Harold Guppey (Graves), who has just stumbled into town to look up his long-lost brother (played by [[Les Dennis]]). Although seemingly prudish (she no longer sleeps in the same bed as her husband, for "medical reasons"), Marjorie takes a liking to Harold despite him being a good twenty years her junior. They begin to have a clandestine affair, sneaking into bed together at night. Ever since taking in her lodger, Marjorie insists that Harold refer to her as "mum", giving more than a little [[oedipal]] slant to their subsequent lustful antics.  Marjorie's youngest daughter is fourteen-year-old Joyce (Sadler), a precocious, [[Lolita]]-like girl who alternates between trying to act grown up by putting on [[make up]] and smoking [[cigarettes]], and acting childish by grossing people out with tales of [[medieval]] punishments and giggling at rude words.   Joyce is fascinated by Harold and with her teasing behaviour she cunningly turns him from being apathetic towards her to being intrigued by her. At one point, she catches Harold in bed with her mum, but seemingly does not realise what they are up to and merely thinks they're having an innocent "bunk up". She talks her way into getting them to let her climb into the bed, both Harold and Marjorie continue their ''intimate relations'' whilst Joyce is asleep, or rather, pretending to be and steadily realising what is actually going on. A few days later, Joyce blackmails Harold into taking her to a hotel for the night, where he turns the tables on her with every intent and purpose but actually diverts his attention by doing much the opposite as he seduces her before spurning her.  Marjorie's husband, Stanley, who is a one-legged World War I veteran, is much older than his wife. Stanley sleeps in a separate room from her and is as oblivious to all the sordid antics of his wife, and daughter, initially as the rest of the suburban neighbourhood is.  Sick of being caught between a mother and daughter, who are too old and too young for him respectively, Harold tries to get out of the house and move away, joining the army and getting a new more suitable girlfriend but Marjorie manages to emotionally blackmail him into coming back.  One day, Harold takes Marjorie and Joyce out for a picnic, although things are tense between the trio. Having sent her daughter Joyce away to play, Marjorie begins to ravish Harold, but Joyce returns and hits her mother with an [[axe]]. Harold panics and attempts to get Marjorie into the car to take her to hospital but, with blood streaming down her face, Marjorie manages to pick up a knife Harold drops and attacks him with it. Harold fights Marjorie off and stabs her to death. Joyce then tries to attack Harold and so he stabs her to death too. Finally, Harold stabs himself in the stomach in an attempt to emphasise that his actions were out of self-defence. It is said in the post-script to the movie the fact he, the real [[Albert Goozee]], was sentenced to death for Joyce's murder, to revise the original decision made during the proceedings the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, with much demand and to further the matter the added charge of murdering Marjorie which had been included in the ruling was dropped because it was considered that there was not enough evidence suitable in the correct degree for this to stand.  
Indian (1996 film)
 Series of murders take place in the district of Avadi in the same pattern of stabbing by a knife. Each time the victim is paralysed before being killed. Police suspect several people and they narrow down the killer with his age which should be more than 70 years with the writing style based on the letter left behind by the killer while murdering his recent victim, an officer in the government treasury. The officer is killed by an old man who later known to be Senapathy, a veteran Indian freedom fighter, for demanding a bribe to do his duty i.e threatening a poor old woman to bribe him to handover compensation amount of Rs.10,000 given by the government as her husband got killed in a riot.   Chandra Bose a.k.a. Chandru ([[Kamal Haasan]]) is a small-time [[Intermediary|middle man]] stationed outside [[Regional Transport Office]], who aids people in greasing the right officials inside the RTO for getting permits and licenses. His assistant Subbaiah ([[Goundamani]]), and Paneerselvam ([[Senthil]]), an RTO official, are engaged in regular tiffs while Aishwarya ([[Manisha Koirala]]), Chandru's love interest and an avid animal rights activist, also battle it out with Sapna ([[Urmila Matondkar]]), the daughter of an RTO official Chandru is trying to hobnob to secure a job for himself at the RTO. Aishwarya is irked by the fact that Sapna (as well her mom) is exploiting Chandru's situation and gets him to do grocery shopping, laundry, and almost every household chore.  Meanwhile, Krishnaswamy ([[Nedumudi Venu]]), a Bureau officer, manages to trace his way to Senapathy's (Kamal Haasan) house. Senapathy is Chandru's father. Archived newspaper reports say that Senapathy was a soldier in the [[Indian National Army]], who was an extremist. Senapati's wife Amirthavalli ([[Sukanya (actress)|Sukanya]]) details the story on their struggles during pre-independence India, the discrimination by [[British Raj|British]] officials and the [[Indian Freedom Movement]] Rebellions against the British atrocities, etc. leading Senapathy marrying Amirthavalli but leaving for [[Singapore]] to join [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] to be part of the INA. He returns after independence and unites with his wife.  In the present day, when Krishnaswamy tries to arrest Senapathy, he escapes with his expertise in [[Varma kalai]]. Senapathy then goes on to commit a murder in front of television audiences by killing a corrupt doctor ([[Nizhalgal Ravi]]) who refused to attend immediately to Senapathy's daughter Kasturi ([[Kasthuri (actress)|Kasthuri]]), who was suffering from [[third degree burns]] because he insisted on a bribe, which Senapathy refused in the past, thus killing her. Chandru parts ways with his father because of his excessive insistence on honesty and righteousness, and he considers these values to be dead and worthless. Public support surges for the ''Indian'' as he exposes so many corrupt people. Senapathy does not do his son any favours either. Chandru had earlier taken a bribe and given a safety certificate to a bus with faulty brakes, which eventually killed 40 school children it was carrying plus the driver operating it, and thus, Chandru is held responsible. Senapathy is bent on giving Chandru the same punishment as he gives others, i.e., death. Towards the end, a chase culminates at the airport, where Senapathy kills Chandru and apparently dies in an explosion. However, Krishnaswamy discovers that Senapathy escaped moments before the jeep exploded which killed his son while investigating the television footage at the airport.  The [[epilogue]] shows Senapathy calling Krishnaswamy from a foreign land ([[Hong Kong]]), indicating that he will be back should the need for him arise.

Irma Vep
 Cheung is employed to play the [[Story within a story|film-within-the-film]]'s [[hero]]ine, Irma Vep (an [[anagram]] for ''[[vampire]]''), a burglar, who spends most of the film dressed in a tight, black, [[latex]] rubber [[catsuit]], defending her director's odd choices to hostile crew members and journalists.  As the film progresses, the plot mirrors the [[disorientation]] felt by the film's director.  Cheung the character is in many ways seen by other characters as an exotic sex object dressed in a latex catsuit; both the director and Cheung's costume designer Zoe ([[Nathalie Richard]]) have crushes on her.  The film makes reference to iconic figures in French film history: [[Louis Feuillade]], [[Musidora]], [[Arletty]], [[François Truffaut]], the Groupe [[Chris Marker#SLON and ISKRA (1967–1974)|SLON]], [[Alain Delon]], and [[Catherine Deneuve]].  Thematically, the film questions the place of French cinema today.  It is not a “mourning for cinema with the romantic nostalgia” but “more like the Mexican [[Day of the Dead]]: remembrance as an act of celebration,”<ref>Chris Darke, “Irma Vep,” ''Sight and Sound'', vol. 7, no. 3 (March 1997), p. 52.</ref> so that “It is less a film about re-presenting the past, than it is a film about addressing the present, specifically the place of France within the global economy.”<ref>Dale Hudson, “‘Just Play Yourself, “Maggie Cheung”’: ''Irma Vep'', Unthinking National Cinemas, and Rethinking Transnational Stardom,” ''Screen'', vol. 47, no. 2 (summer 2006), p. 232.</ref>

He decides to host a party for his family and friends, at the end of which he will commit [[suicide]] by taking [[Seconal]].  "You won't leave me, will you?" Nick asks his estranged lover, Brandon Theis ([[Gregory Harrison]]) a [[B movie]] director, shortly after revealing to him the results of his last blood test for HIV. "I don't want to die alone." In spite of Brandon's protestations, the two soon find the love they had shared for many years in ruins. One year after their breakup, Nick is confronted with a ravaged immune system and a CT Scan and lab values which, along with his worsening forgetfulness, clinches the diagnosis of [[Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] (PML) -- a condition he has seen claim his friends and one which he vows will not take him. Due to the aggressive nature of the disease, he has only a few days of conscious life remaining. His plan, he announces to family and "extended family," is to voluntarily end his life himself before the disease renders him unrecognizable to those he loves and he, in turn, is unable to recognize them. Uninvited to the farewell party, Brandon's presence is greeted with jeers from those who see him as having abandoned Nick in his time of greatest need.  
The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996 film)
 In 2010, [[United Nations]] negotiator Edward Douglas ([[David Thewlis]]) survives a plane crash in the [[Java Sea]] and is eventually rescued by a passing boat. Aboard, a man called Montgomery ([[Val Kilmer]]) tends to him. After telling him the boat has no radio, he promises Douglas the captain will take him to Timor after dropping him off. However, when they arrive at Montgomery's destination referred to as "Moreau's Island", he instead advises Douglas to stay with him, ostensibly so he can use the radio on the island.  Montgomery unloads a shipment of [[rabbit]]s at a pen, and one runs away while he slaughters another for Douglas's meal. They then head on to the Main House where Douglas is warned not to wander. There, he meets a daughter of Dr. Moreau's called Aissa ([[Fairuza Balk]]), but Montgomery turns him away from her and leads him to his room. On the way, they discuss how Moreau vanished after becoming obsessed with his animal research. Montgomery locks Douglas in his room, but he manages to escape that night. He then comes across a laboratory where he witnesses the birth of a mutant baby, belonging to and delivered by human-animal [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]. He is noticed, escapes, and runs into Aissa who leads him to the village of the mutants. On the way, they find the partially eaten corpse of a rabbit, not far from a leopard hybrid called Lo-Mai ([[Mark Dacascos]]). At the village, they find the Sayer of the Law ([[Ron Perlman]]) whose Law preaches "being human" in terms of restraint and discipline. Dr. Moreau ([[Marlon Brando]]), referred to as "The Father" by the mutants, appears. He controls the villagers by using a remote control that causes pain through an implant under the creatures' skin. Moreau forces the village to hand over Douglas only to peacefully take him to the House to discuss the situation.  Douglas, Montgomery and Moreau gather and he introduces his hybrid "children" and later dine. Then, he explains his creations: he introduced human [[DNA]] into animals in search of a higher being, incapable of harm. The existing Beast Folk are imperfect, but Moreau claims to be "closer than [Douglas] could possibly imagine" in his quest. Moreau's "son" Azazello ([[Temuera Morrison]]) comes in with the rabbit, to the disgust of Moreau, who abhors killing. When he learns of the eaten rabbit, he promises that there will be a trial the next day. Douglas tries to escape by boat, but finds it overrun with [[rat]]-like creatures and gives up.  At the trial, Azazello unexpectedly shoots Lo-Mai. His body is burned and a mutant called Hyena-Swine (Daniel Rigney) comes, notices the pain implant among his remains, then removes his own. Montgomery reveals to Douglas that in addition to the pain, the animals are controlled through regular drugging to prevent them from "retrogressing". Hyena-Swine shows off the removed implant, and so Montgomery sets the other beasts after him. Meanwhile, Douglas tries to contact the outside world, but Montgomery sabotages the radio, and Aissa reveals to Moreau that she is regressing as it shows her growing [[cat]]-like fangs.  Hyena-Swine and his trackers (now on his side and also free of implants) break into the House and confront their Father. Angry over their hybrid nature and no longer under his control, they reject humanity and the Law and kill Moreau. His children grieve, except for Azazello, who steals Montgomery's gun and goes to join the savages. Aissa informs Douglas that he can stop her regression with a serum from the lab. However, it turns out Montgomery has gone insane and destroyed it. Douglas also finds samples and a file with his name on them, and finds out that Moreau was planning to use his DNA to stop Aissa's regression permanently, completing his experiments. Montgomery becomes the new "Father", mimicking Moreau's costume and voice. Meanwhile, Azazello leads the savages to the armory.  Under Azazello's guidance, the savages arm themselves with assault weapons and take over the island. Azazello shoots Montgomery at the village and Hyena-Swine's faction rampages around the island. Azazello and his allies hang Aissa and capture Douglas. Having served his purpose, Azazello is shot dead by Hyena-Swine after bringing Douglas to him. Douglas manages to survive by telling Hyena-Swine to impose his leadership as "God Number One" by turning on the others in his faction. During the battle, Douglas escapes, Hyena-Swine's henchmen are all killed, and he is shot. Fatally wounded and rejected by his fellow beasts, Hyena-Swine walks into a burning building to die, wondering aloud why Moreau created him.   The Sayer of the Law and Assassimon see off Douglas as he prepares to leave the island. Douglas offers to help cure the beast folk of their regression, but the Sayer of the Law tells him that the hybrids want to return to their natural state of being, which is "better" than the semi-human condition Moreau tried to force upon them. In closing narration, Douglas reflects on the savagery that also emerges in humans and claims that returns to humanity "in fear".

Istanbul Beneath My Wings
 The film takes place in the 17th century. Two brothers Hezarfen Ahmet Çelebi and his brother Lagari Hasan Çelebi are researching bird flight. The new Sultan [[Murat IV]] resists the domination of his mother, the Valide [[Kösem Sultan]] and tries to enforce strict law and order in the empire. Meanwhile, a Venetian ship that has been captured by Algerian pirates is brought into Istanbul. One of those on the ship is a girl with a manuscript showing how to fly, the latter of which comes into Hezarfen's possession. However, this manuscript can't be deciphered by anyone.  Hezarfen and Hasan are caught examining a dead body (which is against the law) and sent to be executed. At the intervention of the Sultan, they are sent for a court trial. Hasan tries to justify the research and experiments by claiming that they could be used as a weapon to defeat the enemies of the Ottomans. Murat forbids experiments on dead human bodies but gives his blessing to the duo's research on flying, hoping for a new army of flying soldiers that could get past ground level barriers like walls and the sea, and drop bombs. To go about their task, Hezarfen and Hasan tell Murat of the undecipherable script and ask him to release the girl from the dungeon.   The script belongs to [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and they realise that he too had the same idea of flying with wings, but the text is coded so they are unable to read it. Hezarfan and the girl (whose name turns out to be Franceska) fall in love. After witnessing some fireworks, Hasan tries experimenting with rockets and during a grand launch, manages to reach a reasonable altitude before bailing out and landing in the water below. When some drinks are accidentally spilt on the manuscript, the coded text becomes visible and Hezarfen uses his own ideas and that of Da Vinci's to build a flying machine consisting of artificial wings. The conservative Şeyh-ül İslam who is against Hezarfen tries to turn the Sultan against him. He succeeds when the Sultan bans Hezarfen from flying and orders his arrest. Hezarfen (with Franceska) manages to escape with the help of [[Evliya Çelebi]] to the [[Maiden's Tower]] and launches his flying machine across the Bosporus.

A [[Triad (underground society)|triad]] boss known as "Jade Faced Tiger" collaborates with foreigners to take over a town and exploit the residents. That night, while Tiger is watching a [[Chinese opera]] performance, the actors on stage suddenly attack him.

Jin, a young peasant from the countryside, travels to the town in search of his father. He meets a pair of orphans, Xiaochun and Xiaoqian, who make a living by conning others. After seeing that he is very good in martial arts, they lie to him that they will help him find his father if he impersonates Iron Monkey. The naive Jin agrees and accepts a deal offered by a rich girl to help her avenge her father, who was murdered by Tiger.

Invasion of Privacy (film)
    
Jack (1996 film)
 The film begins as Karen Powell ([[Diane Lane]]) goes into [[Childbirth|labor]] during a [[Halloween]] party and is rushed to the hospital by her husband, Brian ([[Brian Kerwin]]), and their friends. Although the delivery is successful, the baby is extremely [[Premature birth|premature]], born after only ten weeks of pregnancy.  Strangely, the infant seems to be a normal, healthy, full-term baby.  After examinations and tests, the infant, now named Jack, is found to have an exaggerated form of [[Werner syndrome]].  Dr. Benfante ([[Allan Rich]]) and Dr. Lin ([[Keone Young]]) diagnose a very rare autosomal recessive disorder.  Their prognosis is that Jack will develop and age at a rate four times as fast as an average child.  Jack ([[Robin Williams]]) is next seen ten years later as a ten year old boy in the body of a forty year old man.  Four boys lurk outside his house, swapping rumors of a "monstrosity" of a boy their age who can't go to [[State school|school]].  He scares them away by dipping a [[madballs|fake eye]] into slime and throwing it at them from his window.  He is extremely childish due to his secluded life.  He has only socialized with his parents and his [[tutor]], Lawrence Woodruff ([[Bill Cosby]]), who introduces the idea that he should go to public school.  His parents initially balk, for fear Jack could be emotionally hurt.  When he first attends school, he is exploited by the other kids to win at [[basketball]] against bullies, and eventually to get [[pornography|adult magazines]] and other such items. As time goes by, he is accepted by them, beginning with Louis, as they discover that they like him. He attempts to be normal there, for example, when he deals with his first crush, heartbreak, and the relationship with his teacher, Miss Marquez ([[Jennifer Lopez]]). When he goes through a fall while attempting to leave, he is rushed to the hospital, where his doctor explains that he suffered a shocking severe strain (which could've been a rare form of [[angina]]), and also, because of his Werner syndrome, his internal clock is starting to run out. Realizing the dangers it might entail for his health, his parents decide to withdraw him from school, which upsets him.  He sneaks out of the house and goes to a bar, where he gets drunk and befriends a man named Paulie ([[Michael McKean]]), and tries to hit on Dolores ([[Fran Drescher]]), Louis's mother. However, he then gets into a fight with a bully (Edward Lynch) and are both arrested. Dolores bails Jack out, leaving the other guy to suffer in jail. Upon returning home, he locks himself in his room and doesn't go out for weeks. Karen speculates that perhaps he realized the fragility of his life and is now scared of facing the outside world again. He also doubts the need to study as he realizes that he wouldn't have the time to use any of the knowledge.  Meanwhile, his friends continue coming to his house, hoping that he will come out and play, but he refuses. Finally, Louis has an idea: he brings the entire class over as they take turns yelling "Can Jack come out and play?" and participate in various games and fun activities right in front of the yard. The next day he decides to go back to school.  Seven years later, an elderly-looking Jack and his four best friends are at their [[high school]] graduation. He delivers the valedictory speech, in which he reminds his classmates that life is short, and urges them to "make your life spectacular," as the four of them drive off into the future.  
James and the Giant Peach (film)
  James Henry Trotter is a young boy who lives with his parents by the sea in England. On James' birthday, they plan to go to New York City and visit the [[Empire State Building]], the tallest building in the world. However, his parents are killed by a ghostly rhinoceros from the sky and James finds himself living with his two ignorant and cruel aunts, Spiker and Sponge.  He is forced to work all day and they antagonize him by threatening him with beatings to keep him in line and torment him about the mysterious rhino and other hazards if he ever attempts to escape. After rescuing a spider from being squashed by his aunts, James meets a mysterious man with a bag of magic green "crocodile tongues", which he gives to James to make his life better. The man instructs him not to lose the "tongues" and disappears. When James is returning to the house, he trips and the "tongues" escape into the ground.   This transforms a peach on a withered old tree into enormous proportions. Spiker and Sponge sell tickets to view the giant peach. James crawls inside a large hole he inadvertently creates in the peach, and he finds and befriends a group of life-size [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] bugs (Mr. Grasshopper, Mr. Centipede, Earthworm, Miss Spider, Mrs. Ladybug, and Glowworm). As they hear the aunts search for James, Mr. Centipede cuts the stem connecting the giant peach to the tree and the peach rolls away to the Atlantic Ocean.  Remembering his dream to visit New York City, James and the insects decide to go there with Mr. Centipede steering the peach. They use Miss Spider's silk to capture and tie a hundred seagulls to the peach stem, while battling against a giant robotic shark. Miss Spider reveals to James that she was the spider he saved from Spiker and Sponge. The next day, James and his friends find themselves in The Arctic; the Centipede has fallen asleep while keeping watch. After hearing Mr. Grasshopper wishing they had a compass, Mr. Centipede jumps off the peach into the icy water below and searches a sunken ship for a compass but is taken prisoner by skeletal pirates. James and Miss Spider rescue him and the journey continues.  As they reach New York City, a storm appears, along with the ghostly rhino. James is frightened but challenges the rhino and gets his friends to safety before the rhino strikes the peach with lightning; James and the peach fall to the city below, landing on top of the Empire State Building. After he is rescued by police officers, firefighters, and the largest crane in New York City, Spiker and Sponge arrive and attempt to claim James and the peach. James reveals Spiker and Sponge's abusive behavior towards him to the crowd, who gasp in shock at the revelation. Spiker and Sponge become enraged by James' betrayal and attempt to kill him. The bugs arrive and tie up Spiker and Sponge with Miss Spider's silk and both aunts are arrested. James introduces his friends to the New Yorkers and allows the children to eat up the peach.  The peach pit is made into a house in Central Park, where James lives happily with the bugs, who form his new family and also take important jobs in the city. James celebrates his ninth birthday with his new family and friends.  
Jake's Women
 Act One: Jake is a successful writer living in New York in 1990. His marriage to wife Maggie is beginning to fall apart. We begin by seeing Jake on stage typing, then, interrupted by a phone call he gets into an argument with sister Karen about meeting up on Saturday night for dinner. After hanging up, an imaginary Maggie 'appears', stating he's always working and he's so busy she doesn't even know why he thought of her. Jake then persuades her to act out the scene in which they met eight years ago at a July fourth party. Maggie plays along for a bit before interrupting the fantasy, stating that the past is not helping them get through the future. Jake expresses his disappointment, and Maggie leaves.   Jake then confides in the audience in how his marriage is in trouble, before calling on his sister Karen to help him. Karen 'appears' and expresses her irritation at his calling her while she was watching The Godfather I, II and III.  Jake explains that he and Maggie are in trouble, and he believes that she has been having an affair with a new man in her office. Karen aggravates him into admitting he had an affair with an actress a year ago before explaining he loves Maggie more than ever and would do anything to keep her. Maggie then arrives home and has just started upstairs for a shower when Jake explains he wishes to speak to her before dinner. Maggie goes to the bathroom, and Karen warns him not to cause trouble for him.  She then leaves.   Maggie enters and begins to fix herself a drink, and Jake explains that they are going to dinner with Karen on Saturday before Maggie interrupts, stating she has to go to Philadelphia on Saturday.  This then leads to an argument between the two, leading Jake to ask, "Do you want out of this marriage?" Stunned, Maggie expresses her wish to stay with him before another argument ensues, with Maggie telling Jake he is controlling and spends more time on his work than with her. She then proposes that they separate for six months to give them some breathing space. As Maggie begins to leave the room, Jake asks her if 'Michael Jaffe' has anything to do with the separation.  He interrogates Maggie until she admits she has slept with Michael, but it wasn't an affair because "it stopped as soon as it started." Maggie then leaves the room.   As Jake is sitting there miserably, his daughter Molly, age twelve, "appears" and begins to talk to him. When asking him if he and Maggie are separating because they both had an affair, Jake violently expresses his reluctance to discuss such matters with a young girl, stating that if she were older, he would discuss it. Younger Molly then agrees, exits, and is replaced by Molly at age twenty one. Older Molly tells her father that the problems between him and Maggie are caused by of Julie, Jake's late wife, and Molly's mother. Molly then persuades Jake to talk to his psychiatrist in his mind, stating it'll give him complete control - his favourite thing in life. Jake agrees and Molly exits.  Edith, Jake's psychiatrist then enters, mocking Jake and his problems. She taunts him and gives seemingly useless advice, stating that he "likes to deprive himself." Eventually, she coerces him into saying what he wants the most, which he says is Julie. Julie then appears, at age twenty one, doing a crossword puzzle and asking Jake for the answers. An ice cream truck is then heard and Julie exits.   Jake then continues to talk to Edith, getting angrier and angrier at her as she continuously taunts and mocks him. Maggie then enters and Jake fixes her a drink, Edith 'fades out' while telling Jake that he always has options and to listen to his wife. Jake and Maggie then launch into a discussion of how Maggie can't seem to stop "running." She explains that she needs time for herself, and after six months they will see if things are any better. Jake scornfully remarks that "you can't keep what you give up," and Maggie tells him that Jake never let Julie go, despite her death. We find out that Maggie has been pregnant several times, but evidently has had miscarriages. Maggie then exits.   Jake confides in the audience that he has tried to let Julie go, and she is always "bursting in on him." Julie, age twenty one then appears, yelling angrily and demanding to know where he has been. Jake is confused until Julie states that they have slept together the previous night. Jake explains to her that it wasn't a late night, and it was twenty-nine years ago. Julie begins to understand that time has passed before stating, "last night was wonderful." Jake then explains to her that they could never be together as they once were, and Julie, horrified, asks him if he is dead.   Jake calls on Karen to help him explain to Julie her death.  Then Julie expresses her relief, telling Jake, "I hate it when somebody I love dies." Julie then expresses her irritation at the fact that Jake only calls her when he's in trouble. Edith appears and she and Karen help support Julie's argument. Julie asks Jake to make her thirty-six, but when he tells her he can't, she begins to fade out in annoyance. Jake finally tells her that she never was thirty-six, that she died in a car accident when she was thirty-five while taking Molly up to camp. Edith and Karen leave. At first, Julie is confused as to who Molly is but then realizes she has a daughter.  After Jake shows her a photo Julie expresses her wish to see Molly, asking Jake to summon her up. Jake refuses, but eventually agrees to let Molly and Julie meet on Julie's "birthday." Molly calls and Jake speaks to her, with Julie exiting.   Jake hangs up and tells the audience how Molly is the only human he ever trusted.  He then reminisces about the time when Molly and Maggie met eight years ago. A younger Maggie then enters expressing her apologies for being late.  She and Jake then chat about going out to dinner before Maggie kisses him just as Molly enters. Molly and Maggie exchange greetings and Maggie hands her a present, which turns out to be an out of date World Atlas. Maggie, embarrassed, admits she grabbed it without looking. Molly then exits, to turn off her TV, and Maggie expresses her joy.  She then leaves to the bathroom. Molly enters and tells Jake that he and Maggie should marry straight away. A phone is then heard and Molly leaves.  Present Maggie enters and states she is staying at the beach house.  She then exits the apartment. Jake gloomily sits on the couch before both Mollys, age twelve and twenty one, appear and sit with him. They try to play a game but it ends up relating back to Maggie, so they simply sit.  Act Two: Begins with Jake, once again, seated at his computer typing. Maggie enters seductively and expresses her wish to be with him again, before laughing in his face. It is realized that Maggie is only a hallucination and she leaves. Jake confides in the audience on how his imaginary women are appearing without his summons, before Karen enters, asking to speak with him.  Karen and Jake get into an argument over his relationships and it is found that he has had several relationships in the six months that Maggie has been gone. He is currently with a woman named Shelia. Edith arrives and together, she and Karen irritate him. Jake realizes they are "really there" and calls Edith in order to help get rid of the hallucinations. Karen and Edith then leave. Jake tells the audience he never called Edith—that it was a trick to get rid of Karen and Edith in his head.   The doorbell rings and Shelia enters.  She and Jake have a strange conversation in which Jake's insanity starts to become clear. Maggie then appears and begins to mock Jake from behind Shelia's back. Jake grows angry with Maggie, frequently shouting at her, with Shelia (who cannot see Maggie) growing frightened. She eventually runs out of the house screaming.  After an Imaginary reunion between Julie and Molly, the real Maggie returns to talk with Jake. She informs him that she has dinner plans with someone and that she believes that person is going to propose, leading to an argument between Jake and Maggie, and eventually Maggie's departure.  Suddenly, Jake hears the voice of his late mother. She informs him of her forgiveness and love of him and then disappears. Then all of the other imaginary characters reappear and say goodbye to Jake. The real Maggie then enters and announces that she canceled the dinner date. She wants to work things out with Jake. Jake walks towards her and they reach out towards each other like [[The Creation of Adam]] in the [[Sistine Chapel]]. The lights fade to black.

Jerry Maguire
 Jerry Maguire ([[Tom Cruise]]) is a glossy 35-year-old [[sports agent]] working for ''Sports Management International'' (SMI). After having a life-altering epiphany about his role as a sports agent, he writes a [[mission statement]] about perceived dishonesty in the sports management business and his desire to work with fewer clients so as to produce better quality. In turn, SMI management decides to send Bob Sugar ([[Jay Mohr]]), Jerry's protégé, to fire him. Consequently, both Jerry and Sugar call all of Jerry's clients to try and convince them not to hire the services of the other.  Jerry speaks to [[Arizona Cardinals]] wide receiver Rod Tidwell ([[Cuba Gooding Jr.]]), one of his clients who is disgruntled with his contract. He needs a $10 million contract for his family to live on. Jerry informed him if he gets injured for the season, he will get no money from the Cardinals. Rod tests Jerry's resolve through a very long telephone conversation while Sugar is able to convince the rest of Jerry's clients to stick with SMI instead. Leaving the office, Jerry announces that he will start his own agency and asks if anyone is willing to join him, to which only 26-year-old [[Single parent|single mother]] Dorothy Boyd ([[Renée Zellweger]]) agrees. Meanwhile, Frank "Cush" Cushman ([[Jerry O'Connell]]), a superstar [[quarterback]] prospect who expects to be the number one pick in the [[NFL Draft]], initially also stays with Jerry after he makes a visit to the Cushman home. However, Sugar is able to convince Cushman and his father to sign with SMI over Jerry the night before the draft. Cushman's father implies they decided to sign with Sugar over Jerry when they saw Jerry attending to Tidwell; an African-American player, versus his son (a white player).  After an argument, Jerry breaks up with his disgruntled fiancée Avery ([[Kelly Preston]]). He then turns to Dorothy, becoming closer to her young son, Ray ([[Jonathan Lipnicki]]), and eventually starts a relationship with her. Dorothy contemplates moving to San Diego as she has a secure job offer there, however she and Jerry agree to get married. Jerry concentrates all his efforts on Rod, now his only client, who turns out to be very difficult to satisfy. Over the next several months, the two direct harsh criticism towards each other with Rod claiming that Jerry is not trying hard enough to get him a contract while Jerry claims that Rod is not proving himself worthy of the money for which he asks.  Rod takes Jerry's advice to prove he is worthy of his contract. Rod is playing well and his team is winning. Meanwhile, Jerry's marriage with Dorothy gradually deteriorates and they eventually separate.  During a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game between the Cardinals and the [[Dallas Cowboys]], Rod plays well but appears to receive a serious [[injury]] when catching a winning touchdown, securing a spot for the Cardinals in the playoffs. He recovers, however, and dances for the wildly cheering crowd. Afterwards, Jerry and Rod embrace in front of other athletes and sports agents and show how their relationship has progressed from a strictly business one to a close personal one, which was one of the points Jerry made in his mission statement. Jerry then flies back home to meet Dorothy. He then speaks for several minutes, telling her that he loves her and wants her in his life, which she accepts. Rod later appears on [[Roy Firestone]]'s sports show. Unbeknownst to him, Jerry has secured him an $11.2 million contract with the Cardinals allowing him to finish his pro football career in [[Arizona]]. The visibly emotional Rod proceeds to thank everyone and extends warm gratitude to Jerry. Jerry speaks with several other pro athletes, some of whom have read his earlier mission statement and respect his work with Rod.  The movie ends with Ray throwing a baseball up in the air surprising Jerry. Jerry then discusses Ray's possible future career in the sports industry with Dorothy.  
Jingle All the Way
 [[File:MOA4.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Part of the film was set and shot in the [[Mall of America]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]]]] Howard Langston is a workaholic mattress salesman with no time for his wife, Liz, and his 9-year-old son, Jamie — especially when compared to next door "superdad" divorcé, Ted Maltin, who continually puts Howard in a bad light. After missing Jamie's [[karate]] class graduation, Howard resolves to redeem himself by fulfilling Jamie's ultimate [[Christmas]] wish: getting an [[action figure]] toy of Turbo-Man, a wildly popular TV superhero. On Christmas Eve, Howard sets out to buy a Turbo-Man doll at a store, telling Liz that he already has one at work that he must retrieve.  Along the way, Howard meets Myron Larabee, a [[postal worker]] dad with a rival ambition, and the two soon become bitter competitors in their race for the action figure. During his search, Howard runs his car into the parked police motorcycle of Officer Hummel, who earlier pulled him over and gave him a ticket. After several failed attempts to find the toy in a store, Howard attempts to buy a Turbo-Man from a [[Mall of America]] Santa, who is actually the leader of a band of counterfeit toy makers. When he accuses the Santa of undermining the values of Christmas (having been ripped off and sold a defective toy that falls apart the moment he opened the package), Howard ends up in a brawl with the gang. He narrowly escapes when the police raid their warehouse and gets out by posing as an undercover detective using a toy badge. While Howard is out trying to buy a toy for his son, Ted the next door neighbor comes to Howard's house on the pretext of helping Liz to prepare for Christmas. Ted even suggests that Liz go upstairs to take a shower and relax. The question of whether Ted succeeds in having intercourse with Liz is left unanswered as the scene switches back to Howard trying to buy the toy.  Later, Howard arrives at [[Mickey's Diner]] and uses their phone to call home. In trying to get a hold of Liz, he scolds Jamie on the phone in frustration over Turbo-Man. Despite Howard instantly regretting it, Jamie rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises and hangs up, with Liz witnessing what happened. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a [[Johnny Seven OMA]] toy on Christmas. They hear on the [[KQRS-FM|KQRS]] radio station that there is a trivia competition in which the winner will receive a Turbo-Man doll. They rush to the studio, with Howard breaking the door to the recording booth, under the impression that the DJ has a Turbo-Man doll in the studio. After Myron threatens to blow up the studio with a package he claims is a mail bomb, he and Howard find out that whoever wins the competition will get a doll "eventually." The package is revealed to be a music box. The police, led by Officer Hummell, arrive in the studio, and Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with another "mail bomb"(unaware that it actually is one), allowing him and Howard to escape. Hummell, claiming to have been in the bomb squad, examines the package and declares it to be a false alarm. He confidently rips open the package and it explodes, leaving his face covered in soot.  After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Outside his home, he sees Ted in his house placing the star on his tree. In anger, Howard breaks into Ted's house and steals the Turbo-Man doll for Ted's son from under his tree. He realizes that he is stealing from a child and changes his mind. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer, accidentally setting one of Ted's decorations on fire, and kicking it out the window trying to stamp it out, drawing the attention of Ted and Liz. Seeing the Turbo-Man present still in Howard's hand, Ted thinks Howard was trying to steal it. Liz, having had enough, leaves with Jamie, Ted, and his son Johnny to the local Christmas parade. The reindeer tries to attack Howard only to be knocked out by him. After making peace with the reindeer, Howard decides it is time he fulfilled his promises and makes his way to the parade.  At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz and she hits him with a thermos of [[eggnog]]. Howard witnesses Ted's actions from a distance, and on his way to confront him, he runs into Officer Hummell, spilling his hot coffee all over him. Hummell recognizes Howard from the studio earlier, causing a chase. Howard is able to escape by hiding in a building where he is mistaken as the replacement actor for Turbo-Man. As the "real" Turbo-Man, he presents the coveted limited-edition Turbo-Man doll to his son. Before Howard can reveal himself, Myron, who has dressed as Turbo-Man's arch enemy Dementor (having caught, tied up and gagged the real actor) appears. Having now become obsessed with getting the doll, Myron attacks Howard and chases Jamie up to a roof, with the crowd apart from Liz thinking it is all part of the show. Jamie climbs up to a metal Christmas tree with Myron following. The weight of the two causes the wires supporting the tree to break and tip the tree over the edge with the two hanging on. Using the Turbo-Man suit's utilities, Howard throws a Turbo-Rang at Myron which misses. Myron seizes the Turbo-Man doll from Jamie's backpack and before he can celebrate, the Turbo-Rang comes flying back, hitting him and causing him to fall down below into the streets. He lands into a giant Christmas present without serious injury and is captured by the police. Jamie loses his grip and falls only to be saved by Howard, using the suit's jetpack.  After the show, Jamie feels guilty for yelling at Howard earlier. Howard, still dressed as Turbo-Man, tells Jamie that his father will always love him, before revealing himself to his son. Officer Hummell gives the doll to Jamie, then asks Howard (as Turbo-Man) to join the police force, saluting him. Howard turns and reveals himself and Hummell is dumbfounded, as Howard apologizes for all the trouble. Myron is arrested while ranting about having to explain his failure to get the Turbo-Man toy for his son. Jamie decides to give the doll to him, much to Myron and Howard's surprise. When asked why he gave it up, Jamie tells Howard that he has "the real Turbo-Man at home."  During the after-credits scene, it is snowing outside. Howard puts the star on the top of his tree and celebrates Christmas with Jamie and Liz. Liz commends Howard for everything he's done just to make Jamie happy, and then asks Howard what he got her for Christmas. Howard stares in shock at the camera before the fadeout.

Finally free of her tormentor, Tara tells Raj that she doesn't even love him enough to hate him; she leaves.   Maya leaves the castle and visits Jai one last time.

He is always behind on his rent and is constantly harassed by his landlady Mrs. Dumars, eventually being reduced to trade sexual favors with her for a break on his back rent.   On a [[Direct selling|sales visit]] to a nearby bowling alley, Roy meets Ishmael Boorg. Roy tries to convince Ishmael to turn pro, with Roy acting as manager.

In college, Sandra studies biology, carefully dissecting the bodies of small animals, trying to avoid disfiguring them. She gets a job at a funeral home to be closer to dead bodies. The funeral home's janitor Jan (James Timmons) believes, like Sandra, that dead bodies still have a soul in them. While driving the hearse with a body in a coffin in the back through a car wash, Sandra looks at the body and finds a shining light, believing that body's soul is alive somewhere.  Mr. Wallis apprentices Sandra in embalming. She starts studying mortuary science, where she meets a medical student named Matt ([[Peter Outerbridge]]) who also must study corpses for his major.

Kimera (manga)
 The series begins when a mysterious space shuttle crash lands on Earth, which is then witnessed by a middle-aged man and his dog who decide to investigate the scene. After coming across the now wrecked-up space shuttle, they begin to hear strange noises coming from the woods; suddenly they see a pair of red licorice-shaped tentacles coming from out of the bloom and a deformed humanoid in a large cloak who then kills the man's dog with it's tentacles and sucking out it's insides, traumatizing the man before he is about to be attacked himself-(though his fate is undetermined).  The scene then shifts to a car driving on the road. In the car, two [[cereal]] salesmen, Osamu-(a foreigner from Japan) and Jay-(Osamu's colleage and best friend), are driving along when they come upon an accident scene. They are ordered by Air Force to flee, but before they can they are attacked by [[vampire|vampiric]] creatures. Osamu is blown into a trailer where he finds a beautiful, green-haired [[androgynous]]-looking figure with striking [[Heterochromia iridum|heterochromia]], Kimera, inside a [[cryogenic]] container. A silver bell he recently purchased and wears around his neck rings, waking the creature inside who kisses him through the glass. Two of the vampire-like creatures arrive, one of them a long ebony-haired male vampire attacking Osamu, and a disfigured one defending him. They disappear, and Osamu and Jay are taken to the Air Force base. They are released as Jay's father, Dr. Gibson, is on the research team there.  Dr. Gibson calmly tells Osamu and Jay to forget everything that happened, though Jay argues it would be impossible and demands an explanation. Gibson is called away and accidentally leaves his security card behind. Osamu and Jay decide to use it to search for Kimera, with Osamu sensing Kimera calling him in the right direction. Meanwhile, the ebony-haired male vampire from the previous night, Kianu, goes through the facility killing people in search of Kimera. He wears a bell bracelet that makes a similar chime to Osamu's bell necklace. One of the research team members, Dr. Fender, meets with the deformed vampire, Ginzu, to discuss the status of the "Mother" system, and Ginzu complains about the lifeless food Fender brings "them."  Osamu and Jay find and free Kimera from the container in a garden within the lab; in the process of being freeded, Kimera passionately kisses Osamu on the lips. Not long after, Kianu attacks them again, explaining that Kimera has to die; otherwise he will bring about the downfall of the planet. Ginzu and his minions' huge snakes break through the glass to attack Kianu, as Gibson and his team arrive after finding their dead companions elsewhere. Kimera begins glowing and the room explodes. After the explosion, Kimera and Osamu are nowhere to be found. Jay learns from his father that Kimera is actually a vampiric alien with fully functional male and female reproductive organs, who arrived on Earth with two other vampires two weeks prior in a meteorite incident.  Kimera reappears in the city, wearing only Osamu's lab coat. Two men from the [[Amusement arcade|arcade]] find and attempt to rape Kimera at a hotel-(while mistaking him for a young woman), who ends up draining them of their blood and killing them. Osamu dreams of Kimera's past and learns that Kimera and Kianu were once in love. In the past, Kimera lived peacefully, refusing to drink blood and having no desire to become "a mother" after seeing what one was. Kimera arrives and tries to [[Sexual intercourse|make love to Osamu]], though he tries to tell her that he isn't Kianu. Ginzu attacks capturing Kimera and has Fender install her in the Mother system in hopes of creating at least two or three children before Kimera is killed. He explains to Osamu that vampires on their planet are no longer able to reproduce and that their ancestors have been betrayed by humans repeatedly through the ages. He also reveals that his, Kianu's, and Kimera's biological mother was originally a kidnapped human woman. Now on their planet, the adults are dying and only Kimera is the remaining one who can reproduce. Neither Ginzu nor Kianu can make children with Kimera as they are not fully functional men.  Kianu arrives and attacks again. As he and Ginzu fight, Fender finishes connecting Kimera to the system and is subsequently killed by Ginzu; who tells him that his services are no longer needed. Wounded and unable to free Kimera himself, Kianu transports Osamu to kill Kimera. As Osamu prepares to shoot his gun, the building collapses, killing Ginsu and Kianu. Jay finds Osamu's bell crushed in the debris and mourns his friend; however, Osamu has survived unharmed and is shown to be together with Kimera in the desert, driving towards an unknown location. Though he knows Kimera happily believes he is Kianu and that their child may destroy the world, Osamu wants to have hope for the future, and is happy being in love with Kimera.

Tommy 'Hopscotch' Hopkins, who has the money, learns of the death of the counterfeiter and begins to fear for his own safety. Consequently, he asks his friend, the street smart Frankie (who owns a strip club), to assist him in an exchange of the fake money for real money which he has organised with some acquaintances. Frankie reluctantly agrees to assist his friend.  The two attend the venue of the exchange, which is the house of an undercover police officer, Danny who uses the alias Paco. Danny believes that he is being assisted by two FBI agents in order to arrest Frankie and Hopscotch. Instead the other two men shoot and kill Danny and attempt to kill Frankie and Hopscotch. Frankie manages to shoot the two men after they kill Danny and he and Hopscotch flee the house with the real and the fake money which is contained in three suitcases. Frankie also pulls some paper out of the jacket of one of the two purported FBI agents. The shootout is witnessed by Danny's sister Colleen, who was hiding in the house. Distraught, she mistakenly believes that Frankie killed her brother and provides the police with his description. After fleeing the scene, Frankie escorts Hopscotch to the house of the latter's brother, Marty. Frankie advises Hopscotch to lie low while he conjures up a plan of what to do with the money. Marty seems concerned that his brother is associating with someone like Frankie.   Colleen is comforted by the colleagues of her dead brother Danny, including his boss Captain Evans. He advises her that they will do whatever is necessary to find Danny's killers. The investigation into Danny's death is led by Vic, who is Colleen's former lover. It transpires that Vic had ended his relationship with Colleen acrimoniously years previously. Despite their troubled past, he spends time with Colleen to help her combat her grief. However, struggling to restrain her emotions, Colleen becomes frustrated with the investigation into her brother's death as she begins to believe that little progress is being made. As she persistently approaches Captain Evans, in a vexed mood, he advises her that they believe Danny was a 'dirty' cop, something which, based on her knowledge of her brother's character, she strenuously refutes. As a result, she loses faith with her brother's former colleagues and decides to conduct her own investigations. She manages to track down Frankie and asks to be allowed to perform at his strip club. He admits that she is pretty enough to do the job, but states that she ought to think it over before making any commitment.  Meanwhile, after Frankie is attacked by the two masked men who killed the counterfeiter, he and Hopscotch decide to bury the three suitcases of money in the desert to ensure that they are safe. After burying the money Hopscotch is killed and Frankie is forced to engage in a shootout with the killer. The killer is revealed to be one of the two masked men and Hopscotch's brother, Marty. Frankie persuades Marty to inform him of the identity of the other masked man who he soon learns is Vic. In a show of disloyalty, Vic kills Marty and requests that Frankie tell him of the whereabouts of the money. Frankie declines to do so and returns to his strip club, where in a private performance he watches Colleen audition for a job. Afterwards, Frankie takes Colleen to his apartment where they begin kissing. Suddenly, Colleen pulls out a gun and confronts Frankie about the death of her brother. Frankie is initially confused but then elucidates upon the events of the shoot out. He advises her that Danny appeared to trust the other two men who were in the room at his house when he was killed and that they turned on him. To convince Colleen that he is telling the truth he manipulates the gun so that Colleen only needs to pull the trigger in order to kill him.   Colleen believes Frankie and he escorts her to her car so that she can travel home. Vic sees Frankie and Colleen together and when Colleen is gone he advises Frankie to stay away from her. The next day Frankie visits Colleen and produces the piece of paper that he took from the purported FBI agent. The piece of paper is part of a map with directions on it in red ink. Frankie advises Colleen that he believes that Vic was involved in her brother's killing. He tells her to tell Vic's superiors in the police and take them to the desert. While Colleen travels to the police station, Frankie advises Vic that he has changed his mind and that he will share the money with him. Frankie and Vic drive to the desert where they dig up the cases with the money in. Meanwhile Colleen and Captain Evans arrive at the desert. Evans advises Colleen to wait in the car as he investigates. As he leaves in pursuit of Vic and Frankie, she finds the other half of the map on the dashboard of the car. Evans walks up a hill and sees Frankie and Vic with the cases of money. Vic manages to hit Frankie with a spade in an attempt to take all of the money for himself after which Evans confronts him. At this point Colleen arrives and Evans shoots Vic in an attempt to conceal his guilt in the affair. He then hugs Colleen and tells her that it is all over. Colleen, now aware that both Vic and Evans were responsible for her brother's death then shoots Evans. Afterwards she and Frankie arrange Vic's and Evans' bodies to make it seem as though they had killed each other in a dispute over one of the cases of money.

Rashmi refuses to believe so, hoping that Sunil will return.  During a gig, Rashmi runs into Krishna and is thrilled to see him. Krishna tells her firmly that he is not Sunil. Only when she sees that a tattoo bearing Rashmi's name, which was supposed to be on Sunil's arm, is missing from Krishna's arm, she leaves, broken-hearted and dejected. However, some goons try to rape her and she is saved by Krishna. Krishna reveals that he is indeed Sunil and goes on to tell the truth. He reveals that his instructor was actually acting as a link for some criminals. He forced Sunil to land at an abandoned place to meet the criminals.  One of the criminals was Cobra ([[Tinnu Anand]]), an infamous name in the underworld. The deal went wrong and Sunil's instructor was killed. Sunil survived somehow and nobody had seen his face. He was wrongfully arrested as a suspect and minister Amar Prabhakar ([[Om Puri]]) bailed him out. Amar told him that if he wants to survive, he has to take down all the people who could pose a possible threat. So, Sunil got booked under another name - Krishna. Meanwhile, Cobra returns to India again. It is revealed that both Bhau and Raja are on his payroll. Cobra decides to make Raja the de facto ruler of his operations in India. Raja tells him about Krishna.  Cobra and Sunil meet, where Cobra suspects that he has seen Krishna somewhere else. Sunil knows that Cobra may recognize him, but now he has come too far. Later, Raja drops by a brothel, where Sunil is surprised to see his sister perform. His sister is shocked to see him too and commits suicide on the spot. Sunil learns from another dancer that most of the dancers have same story to share - a man came in their life pretending to be a well to do person, married them and sold them, where they were raped before ending up here. He realizes that the man whom he gave his sister to is responsible for destruction of so many girl's lives.  The dancer also tells him that he keeps a record, mostly videotapes of the people he has sold the girls to, in order to blackmail them. In a fit of rage, Sunil accosts the man, but he dies. Sunil receives another blow when he learns that his mother has died. Amar keeps the truths under wraps and gives Sunil's mother the funeral she deserved. Sunil also learns that Amar's own daughter has been kidnapped and that Cobra has the tape which may uncover the identity of his sister's rapist. On learning of Cobra's another deal with Bhau and Raja, Sunil decides to end it all. In a bloody aftermath, the criminals are killed.  Sunil finds the tape, whereby he receives a shocker that his sister was raped by none other than Amar. Here, it is revealed that Amar's daughter is not kidnapped; it was only a ploy to garner public sympathy for the next elections. However, the Commissioner ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]) learns of this fraud and Amar has him captured. Next day, Amar is giving a speech when an enraged Sunil turns up. He makes his way to Amar. The Commissioner, who has somehow succeeded in escaping, manages to save Sunil from being taken down. He pleads to Sunil to let the police take over. Amar tries to run away, taking advantage of the situation, but Sunil removes a fake Sudarshan Chakra from an idol of lord Krishna and beheads Amar with it. With Amar dead, Sunil surrenders.

The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists
 Littlefoot notices a Longneck herd entering the Great Valley and informs his grandparents, who tell him that the Longnecks are their cousins and that they must go to greet them. Upon the herd's arrival, the Old One, the herd's leader, tells the Great Valley's residents that her herd has been migratory ever since a heavy period of rain turned their old home into a marshland called "The Land of Mists" and became the home of many dangerous creatures. Later, Littlefoot meets a female Longneck named Ali and invites her to play. He introduces her to his friends, but as she is not used to associating with diverse species, she is afraid of them.  Meanwhile, Grandpa becomes ill. The Old One notes that she has seen that illness many times; and says that it is lethal to any dinosaur unless they eat the golden petals of the "[[Epiphyllum oxypetalum|Night Flower]]". She continues that sick dinosaurs eat them and are cured if they eat them on time. The "Night Flower" only grows in the Land of Mists. Though Littlefoot is warned that the Land of Mists is too dangerous, he becomes determined to save his grandfather and asks Ali to take him there. She agrees on the condition that Cera, Ducky, Petrie, and Spike do not come along, claiming that they will slow them down. As the two of them make their way, they pass through a cave and a sudden [[earthquake|earthshake]] causes various [[stalagmite]]s and [[stalactite]]s to crash down, separating them. Ali returns to the Valley and convinces Littlefoot's friends to help her free him. Meanwhile, Littlefoot tries to find a way out and meets an old ''[[Archelon]]'' named Archie, who helps him dig through the rocks.  As they work, Littlefoot and Archie are interrupted by a ''[[Ichthyornis]]'' named Ichy and a mostly-blind ''[[Deinosuchus]]'' named Dil, who intend to eat them. Ichy and Dil pursue Littlefoot and Archie, but are knocked out when Ali and Littlefoot's friends dig a hole in the rock wall and send rocks tumbling down on them. Archie (who helps the children escape Dil and Ichy for the first time) shows Littlefoot and his friends a way to the Land of Mists and reminds them to stay close together before departing. In the Land of Mists, Cera is separated from the group. The others meet a [[Megazostrodon]] that Ducky names Tickles because of his fur, which tickles her when she hugs him. Immediately after, Tickles helps them find Cera. However, Cera falls into a river and is pursued by Ichy and Dil, who have now recovered from their prior knockout in the cave. Dil and Ichy both arrive (surviving their prior knockout), and Ichy thanks the children for showing him the shortcut; the shortcut leading him "to dinner". After he completes his sentence ("TO DINNER!"), he breaks the vines from Cera's rescuing contraption (which the others had made). This sends Cera flying back into the river so she can be pursued by Dil and Ichy. Ali saves Cera and distracts the predators, after which Cera softens towards Ali. Later, Ali explains her prejudicial behavior, having never interacted with species outside of her own, but remarks that her attitude towards Littlefoot's friends has now changed.  When the seven stop for the night, they realize they are in a field of Night Flowers after they bloom, and quickly stock up on them. As they make their way home, Ichy and Dil return for another attack. During a chase, Petrie is grabbed by Ichy but rescued thanks to Tickles, who tricks Ichy into biting Dil's tail rather than Petrie. Dil becomes upset at Ichy, but they quickly resume the chase, during which Ducky falls into a river and becomes unconscious. Spike then speaks for the first time by calling out Ducky's name, which awakens her as she is about to be consumed by Dil. Ducky escapes, and Spike uses his tail to knock Ichy toward Dil's open jaws as she tries to consume Ducky.  Dil (after mistaking Ichy for Ducky by accident), she instead chomps Ichy by accident. He kicks on the roof of Dil's mouth (saying, "Please don't swallow Dil! It's me Ichy! Open up, idiot! YOU ALMOST ATE ME!"). Ichy accuses Dil for almost eating him. Then the two get into another argument. The two declare that they have had enough of each other and should separate forever (and "go it alone"). Dil then swats Ichy away with her tail. Then she tells herself that it should teach him. Finally, she is pursued by a [[Plesiosauria|plesiosaur]] called a [[Hydrotherosaurus]]. He unknowingly saves Littlefoot and his friends by chasing Dil away. Dil desperately cries out for Ichy while being chased. Her fate becomes unknown; as it is unknown whether or not she was eaten by the ''Hydrotherosaurus''.   With the predators gone, Littlefoot and his friends say goodbye to Tickles and head home. They give Grandpa the blossoms, and he gets better a few hours later upon eating them. Ali then leaves with her herd, but not before trying to convince Spike to say goodbye, which he does not, as he is too interested in consuming leaves. The narrator concludes that Littlefoot and the others would indeed meet Ali again one day.

Larger than Life (film)
  The film opens at a convention of recliner salesmen, where Jack Corcoran ([[Bill Murray]]) gives a motivational speech based on his book ''Get Over It''. Jack shares the example of his father dying before he was born as a difficult circumstance that must be overcome to succeed. At Jack's engagement party, his agent ([[Jeremy Piven]]) updates him on all of his upcoming speaking engagements, and the pair hope that one of the engagements is high profile enough to lead to an [[infomercial]].  As the party winds down, Jack reads telegrams from well wishers. One of the telegrams is from an attorney in Baltimore about the large estate of his recently deceased father Kirk. Jack's mother shortly admits that she lied about his father's death. In truth, she left him because she felt he would be a bad example for Jack.  The attorney in Baltimore shows Jack a contract which mentions $35,000. Thinking this is the size of his father's estate, Jack signs the contract. In fact, it is the amount of property damage that the attorney has suffered because of Vera, Kirby's elephant. Vera and Kirby were a traveling circus act, and she is a highly trained elephant. Kirby left a note for Jack that instructed him to call "Blockhead" in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] if there are any problems with Vera. Jack contacts Mo ([[Janeane Garofalo]]) at the [[San Diego Zoo]], who happens to be transporting a herd of elephants to [[Sri Lanka]] in a few days. She helps Jack ascertain that Vera is a breeding age female, and she agrees to pay $30,000 for the elephant.  Jack and Vera board a train bound for San Diego, but the conductor ([[Keith David]]) insists on a bribe. Jack's $600 only gets them as far as [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], where he looks up Blockhead, who is an old circus buddy of Kirby's. Blockhead shows Jack the extent of Vera's training, including a photo of Vera standing on her hind legs, which was a trick that she would only do for Kirby. He puts Jack onto an animal trainer in [[Los Angeles]] named Terry Bonura ([[Linda Fiorentino]]) who works in show business. Terry offers Jack $40,000 for Vera. So, he and Blockhead attempt to drive to L.A., but his truck breaks down. Jack rents a [[semi-truck]] and continues on his own. With no experience driving a big rig, Jack blows out the transmission.  Stuck at a truck stop, he encounters Tip Tucker ([[Matthew McConaughey]]) who is a fast-talking, deeply paranoid trucker bound for L.A. Jack slips outside to call Tip's mobile phone, and he tricks Tip into thinking his load has been canceled. Tip agrees to take Jack and Vera to L.A. instead. Along the way, Tip makes a phone call and realizes he has been tricked by Jack. He attacks Jack with a [[tire iron]], but Vera intervenes and saves Jack from a beating. Tip drives off threatening to come back with the police.  Jack and Vera walk into New Mexico to evade Tip. They stumble into a [[monsoon]] that is threatening to tear apart a village church. As the villagers struggle to hold the walls up, Vera intervenes, holding the wall up with her head. The wall still threatens to collapse, and Jack gets her to stand on her hind legs to brace the wall for good. The villagers help Jack and Vera board a train that will finally take them to L.A.  As he is about to sign the contract to sell Vera to Terry, Jack realizes that she subjects her animals to a grueling workload, and he witnesses one of Terry's trainers abusing another elephant with an electric [[goad]]. He steals one of Terry's trucks and drives to San Diego. Tip found Terry's business card in the cab of his truck, and he arrives just as Jack leaves.  At the San Diego airport, Mo is loading her elephants onto a [[C-5 Galaxy]] cargo plane. The tarmac security guard will not let Jack and Vera in because they are not on the manifest. Jack pulls the truck into the passenger drop-off in front of the airport and races through the terminal with Vera. At gate security, Tip finally catches up to them, waving Terry's electric goad. Jack convinces the security guards that Tip is more of a threat than Vera, and they deal with Tip while Jack and Vera catch up to Mo on the tarmac.  Mo explains that she has spent her entire budget and has no money for Vera. Jack confesses to Mo that he will miss Vera, but he knows she would be better off with other elephants. The film ends with a series of captions that indicate Jack left his fiancee for Mo, and the couple witnessed the birth of Vera's first calf in Sri Lanka together. Jack's ex-fiancee married his agent and Jack's mother ran their life. Tip Tucker also managed to get away and is still roaming the roads of America. The captions conclude by saying that ''Get Over It'' never made it to a [[2nd printing]], but Jack's memoir of his cross-country trip with Vera was a runaway besteller.

As he arrives, a young woman named Felina ([[Karina Lombard]]) crosses the street, catching Smith's eye. Moments later, a group of Irish mobsters, led by Finn ([[Patrick Kilpatrick]]), surround Smith's car. They warn him against staring at "Doyle's property" and puncture his tires and smash his windshield.  Smith leaves his car in the street and goes to speak with Sheriff Ed Galt ([[Bruce Dern]]). Sheriff Galt doesn't bother to conceal his cowardice or corruption, saying he won't act against Doyle's gang and advises Smith to wait for his car to be repaired and to leave town. Instead, Smith walks to the town hotel, run by Joe Monday ([[William Sanderson]]) where Smith orders a drink, books himself a room, and arms himself before announcing his intention to petition Finn for damages. Smith enters Doyle's building, finds Finn, and asks him to pay for the damages to his car. Finn mocks him and threatens to shoot Smith. Smith and Finn get in a [[Fast_draw|gunfight]], which Smith wins with alarming speed. Smith departs, leaves the remaining gangsters alive as witnesses, and returns to the hotel bar, much to the surprise of Jericho's residents.  Following Finn's death, Fredo Strozzi ([[Ned Eisenberg]]), the head of Jericho's Italian gang, offers Smith a job in his outfit. Strozzi predicts a gang war between his and Doyle's gang, and is hiring as many skilled soldiers as he can. Smith accepts the job and sits down to dinner with the Strozzi gang where he meets Giorgio Carmonte ([[Michael Imperioli]]), son of a prominent [[Chicago]] mobster who is monitoring Strozzi's activities in Jericho. Carmonte expresses his distrust with Smith, who leaves the dinner, and meets and seduces Strozzi's mistress, Lucy ([[Alexandra Powers]]).  Smith accompanies Strozzi and his men to a remote Texas road. Together with Ramirez, a corrupt Mexican police ''capitán'' providing security for Doyle, Strozzi ambushes and kills Doyle's men and seizes his entire liquor shipment. Following the ambush, Carmonte travels to Mexico to cut more deals with Ramirez. Meanwhile, Doyle ([[David Patrick Kelly]]) and his right-hand man, Hickey ([[Christopher Walken]]) return to Jericho and hear about the recent events, from Smith's arrival to Finn's death and the loss of their liquor shipment.   Smith defects to the Doyle Gang and reveals to them Strozzi and Carmonte's bribery of Ramirez. Hickey travels to Mexico, where he kills Strozzi's and Ramirez's men, a corrupt [[United States Border Patrol|U.S Border Patrol]] officer, and kidnaps Carmonte. Doyle contacts Strozzi and demands a large ransom for Carmonte, as well as the return of his trucks. Strozzi in turn kidnaps Felina and offers an even trade, Felina for Carmonte. The two gangs make the exchange and return to their respective empires.  Smith is summoned by Sheriff Galt and meets Captain Tom Pickett ([[Ken Jenkins]]) of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], who is upset over the death of the Border Patrol officer. He warns Smith that he can tolerate one gang in Jericho, but not two. He says that in ten days he will bring a squad of 20 Texas Rangers to Jericho and if he finds more than one gang, will wipe them both out. Smith says he intends to play the gangs against each other, wiping them both out and making money in the process. Pickett leaves, emphasizing that, if he finds Smith here in ten days, he'll kill him as well.  Lucy comes to Smith and reveals that Strozzi, angered after the exchange, beat her and had Giorgio cut her ear off when she revealed her affair with Smith. Smith gives her some money and puts her on a bus out of Jericho. The next day Smith relays a false rumor that Strozzi is bringing in more soldiers. Playing on Doyle's obsession with Felina, he makes Doyle afraid that Strozzi will try to kidnap her again, and Doyle orders Smith to go to the safehouse where Felina is being held. Smith kills the men guarding Felina. Felina reveals that her husband lost to Doyle on a game of poker and he kept her as a prize, and she goes to Mexico to return to her family, with Smith giving her one of Doyle's cars and some money. The next day, Smith is waiting at the safehouse when Doyle arrives, and claims that he arrived too late, Strozzi's men had already killed the guards and abducted Felina. Doyle's henchman Jack McCool ([[R. D. Call]]) believes Smith's story, while Hickey suspects that Smith killed the guards and freed Felina. Doyle goes berserk and declares all-out war on Strozzi and his gang.  Smith's plan goes awry when Hickey and some of Doyle's men ambush Smith, with Hickey revealing that he had pieced together the truth by learning that Felina was not abducted by Strozzi and had sold her car in Mexico and took a bus to the South. Doyle imprisons Smith and has him tortured, demanding to know where Felina is. Despite the heavy torture inflicted on him, Smith refuses to talk. Later that night, he escapes by killing two of Doyle's men, and escapes town with the aid of Monday and Sheriff Galt. As they are driving out of town, they see Doyle's gang slaughtering Strozzi's gang at a roadhouse. After all of their men are killed by Doyle's men, Strozzi and Carmonte exit the roadhouse and try to surrender to a revenge-driven Doyle. Hickey shoots Strozzi to death, while Carmonte is killed by Doyle's men.  Smith takes refuge at a remote church where Felina went to pray. Two days later, Sheriff Galt arrives and informs Smith that Monday was caught smuggling food and water to Smith and that Doyle will probably torture him to death. He then hands Smith his pistols and informs him that that is all the help Smith can expect from him. Smith returns to town and storms Strozzi's hotel, which is now Doyle's headquarters and kills all of Doyle's men, including McCool, and rescues Monday. Doyle and Hickey are absent, having gone down to Mexico in a desperate search for Felina.  In the final scene, Doyle, Hickey and Deputy Bob confront Smith at the burned-out remains of Strozzi's hideout since Smith summoned them there. Doyle, still despondent over the loss of Felina, tells Smith they can be partners and begs him to reveal where to find her. Before he can get further, Monday shoots Doyle in the chest with a Wild-West era revolver, killing him for "ruining his town" and Smith shoots a shotgun-wielding Bob before he can retaliate. Hickey drops his [[submachine gun]] and says he doesn't want to die in Texas ("Chicago maybe") and starts to walk away, intending to actually kill Smith. With lightning speed he turns and quickdraws a pistol from his holster, but Smith is faster and shoots Hickey, killing him.  Smith gets into his Ford (which was repaired by the mechanic) and drives on to Mexico, his original destination, leaving Monday some money and Doyle's car to return to Jericho. He reflects that he is as broke as he was when he first arrived, having given all the money he made off the two gangs to various women in order to get them out of town, including Felina and Lucy. However, he consoles himself that everyone in the two gangs is better off dead.

The girls venture into the temple one night while everyone is asleep and they discover an ancient book written in Latin. Faith is fluent in Latin and translates the book, which outlines a spell that will summon a demon from the pits of hell. Jamie and some of the other girls are eager to practice the spell, but Faith is reticent due to the spell requiring a virgin sacrifice - especially after learning that the schoolgirls were murdered by a guardian devoted to keeping the spell from being cast. This reluctance, along with her interactions with a handsome construction worker named Daniel (Tommy Stork), helps alienate her from Jamie, who was somewhat attracted to him. Things grow more tense when the teens return to the hidden room and discover that there is still a guardian around, as the room was covered in graffiti that warned them that summoning the demon would lead to their deaths. Because Faith has refused to help translate the rest of the book, Jamie decides to play a cruel trick on her by inviting Daniel to their room and making it appear as if he was trying to rape her.

This ends up being to Faith's benefit, as she manages to avoid falling under one of Jamie's spells by praying with Mother Clodah. Unfortunately the encounter also ends with Mother Clodah's death due to Jamie poisoning her meal, believing Mother Clodah to be the guardian. Jamie, who has taught herself to read Latin due to Faith's refusal to translate, proceeds with the spell as planned. The movie implies that the teens will use Faith as a sacrifice due to her virginal nature, but Jamie ends up using Daniel instead after she learns that he is also a virgin. Horrified that they are moving forward with the spell, Faith receives help from Sister Sherilyn, who reveals that she is the guardian. They manage to stop the ceremony in time to save Daniel, but at the cost of the lives of Jamie and all of the other girls involved with the spell.  
London Suite (play)
 The action takes place in a London [[hotel]] overlooking [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in a series of four plays:  *''Settling Accounts'' Brian Cronin and Billy Fox. Brian is a successful Welsh novelist; Billy is his manager, whom Brian has caught in the process of running off with all his money. In the film, this pair was changed to Debra and Paul Dolby, a newlywed couple from [[New York City]] who are on their [[honeymoon]]. Paul has disappeared after the couple had a fight on the plane, and now Debra is caught in a chain of increasingly ridiculous lies when she runs into his relatives at the hotel.  * ''Going Home'' Sharon and Lauren Semple. A mother and daughter on a shopping trip. Lauren convinces her mother to go on a date with an elderly man, even though Sharon is heavily against it.  * ''Diana and Sidney'' Sidney and Diana Nichols. A divorced couple: she is an [[actress]], and he is living with his male lover. Now he claims he needs money from her to help pay the medical bills for his partner who is dying from [[lung cancer]]. The pair are based on characters from ''California Suite'', played in the 1978 film by [[Michael Caine]] and [[Maggie Smith]].  * ''The Man on the Floor'' Mark and Anne Ferris. An [[United States|American]] couple who are in London for the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] Championships. Their plans are put on hold, however, when Anne loses the tickets, Mark's back gives out, and they are asked to move because they have accidentally been given [[Kevin Costner]]'s suite.  With the exception of Sidney and Diana's storyline (and Brian and Billy's in the play), the plots are largely [[comedy|comedic]].  
Lilies (film)
  ===Expository narration=== ''Lilies'' is set in a [[Quebec]] [[prison]] in 1952. Jean Bilodeau ([[Marcel Sabourin]]), the local [[bishop]], is brought to the prison to hear the confession of Simon Doucet ([[Aubert Pallascio]]), a dying inmate. But Doucet in fact has a very different revelation for Bilodeau: he has enlisted his fellow inmates to stage a play set in 1912, when Bilodeau and Doucet were childhood friends.  ===The play within the film=== Most of the film consists of the [[Story within a story|play within the film]], presented by the inmates for Bilodeau and Doucet. Because it is taking place within a prison, the female roles are portrayed by the male prisoners. The young Bilodeau and Simon are performed by younger inmates ([[Matthew Ferguson]] and [[Jason Cadieux]]).  The play dramatizes a period during Bilodeau and Simon's childhood in [[Roberval, Quebec]], when they were both coming to terms with their [[homosexuality]]. Simon has a romantic relationship with Vallier ([[Danny Gilmore]]), while Bilodeau remains repressed and tries desperately to convince Simon to join the [[seminary]] with him. All three are involved in a school play dramatizing the [[martyr]]dom of [[Saint Sebastian]], with Simon in the lead role. The St. Sebastian play's homoerotic undertones contribute to Bilodeau's sexual awakening, which involves an unrequited love for Simon. Bilodeau recognizes the nature of the relationship between Simon and Vallier, and confronts them one afternoon after the rehearsal of the St. Sebastian play. Simon and Vallier attack and subdue Bilodeau, so that Simon can engage him in a derisively passionate kiss. In the middle of the kiss, Vallier's mother, the Countess de Tilly ([[Brent Carver]]) enters the arena, forcing Simon to break off the kiss and flee. Vallier's mother (who is slightly insane) is unperturbed at what she has seen, and has Vallier escort her to the arrival of a Parisian aristocrat arriving in a hot air balloon.  Simon's father is also at the arrival, where Vallier's mother unwittingly reveals to him that she saw his son passionately kissing Bilodeau. In a rage, Mr. Doucet finds Simon and brutally beats him, to the point where he must find medical attention for his wounds. He chooses to see a Parisian doctor staying at the hotel in town (to avoid the town doctor telling his business), and he meets Lydie-Anne ([[Alexander Chapman]]), a young [[Paris]]ian baroness. Because of the beating, Simon renounces his love for Vallier and appears to fall in love with Lydie-Ann, eventually becoming engaged to her. However, Vallier's mother encourages Vallier to attend the engagement party and declare his love for Simon. At the party, it becomes apparent that Simon never stopped loving Vallier and was only using Lydie-Ann to pass as heterosexual. Because her feelings are hurt, Lydie-Ann reveals to Vallier's mother that her estranged husband is living happily in Paris with a new wife and child. She also tells her that she came to Roberval on the recommendation of Vallier's father, and while he mentioned structures and the landscape of the town, he never once spoke of the wife or child he left behind there.  After the party, Simon and Vallier meet for one last romantic encounter. Afterwards, Vallier's mother says that she will be going to Paris, and invites Simon and Vallier to see her off. Instead, she leads them to a place in the woods, where she lies down in a shallow grave and has Vallier strangle her to death. Bilodeau witnesses the murder, and is spurred to confess his love for Simon.  When rejected, he sets fire to the room where Vallier and Simon are staying and locks the door, so that they cannot escape. Because there are no windows and no other way to ventilate the space, the two young men are soon overcome by the smoke and heat. Bilodeau is remorseful and returns in time to drag Simon to safety, but leaves Vallier in the room. Bilodeau falsely tells the policemen who have arrived on the scene that Vallier is already dead, so they do not go back to save him, and he perishes in the flames.  ===Conclusion=== The play reveals that Vallier's murder is the crime for which Simon Doucet was falsely arrested and convicted. Thus, the play was designed not as Doucet's confession of his sins, but a ploy to extract a confession of guilt from Bilodeau. As a result, Bilodeau asks Doucet to kill him, but Doucet refuses.  
Loch Ness (film)
 At [[Loch Ness]], [[Scotland]], scientist Dr. Abernathy is killed by slipping off some rocks, after seeing something in the loch and taking a single photograph of it. Months later, American [[zoologist]] and freshman college tutor, Dr. John Dempsey, is asked to replace Abernathy and dispel the myth of the [[Loch Ness Monster]]. Dempsey is reluctant to do so, having ruined his career by trying to prove the existence of the [[Sasquatch]]. He agrees to go for the money, which would allow him to pay [[alimony]] to his ex-wife, naming a newly discovered species of [[wasp]] after her.  Arriving in Scotland, Dempsey meets Dr. Abernathy’s assistant Adrian Foote, who fanatically believes in the monster. Dempsey rents a room at a local [[inn]] run by Laura McFetridge and her young daughter, Isabel, who grows close to him. He soon meets the other locals, fisherman Andy McLean, who aggressively comes to see Dempsey as a rival for Laura’s affections; eccentric Gordon Shoals, who claims the monster is his property; and the [[Water Bailiff]], who is highly protective of the legend, and tries to repeatedly sabotage Dempsey’s efforts.  Using state-of-the-art technology, Dempsey scans the whole loch, and is unable to find any trace of the monster. When he declares the end of the myth, Adrian angrily berates him, but Dempsey admits he wants to find the dinosaur to rebuild his career, left cynical by his failure to find the Sasquatch. Dempsey later receives Dr. Abernathy’s camera, discovering the photo he took on the night he died – revealing it shows a dinosaur’s flipper. He and Adrian venture out to search the loch again. After tracking a 40-foot long object, it collides with and sinks the boat. Dempsey nearly drowns, but is rescued by an unseen creature, and the Water Bailiff. A thrilled Dempsey claims to have seen the monster.  Andy assaults Dempsey for his relationship with Laura, but she defends him. Isabel gives him a get well card, with a drawing of what she calls a “water [[kelpie]]” on it. Realising she, too, has seen the monster, Dempsey convinces Isabel to show him where it lives, and he will buy her a red bicycle she has always wanted. Isabel leads him to an underground cavern beneath [[Urquhart Castle]], where they encounter a family of [[plesiosaur]]. Isabel can communicate with them through a series of whistles. In astonished euphoria, Dempsey takes photographs of the monsters, frightening them, and knocking Isabel into the water. He saves her, but is confronted by the Water Bailiff.  Dempsey is kicked out of the inn by a furious Laura, and Isabel is deeply hurt by his betrayal. Dempsey and Adrian travel to [[London]] to publicly reveal the dinosaurs’ existence. Dempsey meets the Water Bailiff on the train, imploring him to not reveal the truth. Dempsey reasons that exposure and science would help the creatures, but the Water Bailiff points out how it was Isabel and her faith, not science, that led him to the dinosaurs.  At a conference at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], Dempsey is unable to go through with the presentation, replacing his photographs with Isabel’s kelpie drawing. On the way out, Dempsey informs Adrian that he fabricated his photographs before coming to Scotland, but Adrian, knowing the truth, understands. The Water Bailiff returns to Loch Ness, discovering Dempsey slipped his photographs into his bag during their conversation on the train. Dempsey returns to the inn, reuniting with Laura and Isabel, bringing the new bicycle with him. The plesiosaur swims through the loch, accompanied by an infant.

 Samantha Caine ([[Geena Davis]]) is a small-town schoolteacher, living with her boyfriend Hal ([[Tom Amandes]]) and her daughter Caitlin ([[Yvonne Zima]]). Eight years earlier, she was found washed ashore on a New Jersey beach, pregnant with Caitlin and totally amnesiac. Having never even remembered her real name, "Samantha" has hired a number of private investigators to try to discover her past, the latest being Mitch Henessey ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]). During the Christmas holidays, Samantha is involved in a car accident and suffers a brief concussion, and when she recovers, she finds that she possesses skills with a knife that she cannot explain. Some time later, the family home is broken into by "One-Eyed Jack" (Joseph McKenna), a convict who escaped from jail after seeing Samantha's face on television. However, Samantha demonstrates her fighting prowess by killing Jack bare-handed. Worried that she may scare Caitlin, Samantha leaves with Mitch, who has been able to find a suitcase purportedly belonging to her, to seek out answers.  The suitcase contains a note directing them to Dr. Nathan Waldman ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]). They arrange to meet at a train station, unaware that unknown agents are tracing the doctor's calls. En route, Samantha discovers the bottom of the suitcase contains a disassembled [[Remington 700|sniper rifle]] which she can expertly reassemble, along with other weapons. At the station, Samantha and Mitch go to meet Waldman and are attacked by a number of agents, but manage to escape with Waldman's help. The doctor reveals that he knows Samantha is really an expert [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] assassin, Charlene Elizabeth "Charly" Baltimore, who had disappeared eight years prior. Unsure if they can trust him, Samantha and Mitch leave Waldman behind and seek another contact named on a note within the suitcase, Luke ([[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]]), believing him to be Samantha's fiancé. Waldman catches up, trying to warn them the note was in code, and the "fiancé" is actually Charly's last assassination target, "Daedalus". Luke kills Dr. Waldman, then captures Samantha and straps her to a waterwheel and tortures her by repeatedly submerging her into freezing cold water. While underwater she's finally jolted into remembering her past life. Samantha escapes, kills Luke, and escapes with Mitch. Samantha completes her physical transformation back to Charly, cutting and dying her hair platinum blonde.  Samantha/Charly struggles with the duality of her life, realizing that the "Samantha Caine" personality was her 'school-teacher cover' to get near to Daedalus eight years earlier, and considered abandoning it. Continuing to search for answers, Charly and Mitch learn about Daedalus' involvement in "Project Honeymoon", which she disrupted on her mission, resulting in One-Eyed Jack's incarceration; "Project Honeymoon" was a [[false flag]] chemical bomb detonation in downtown [[Niagara Falls, New York]], planned out by the CIA in an attempt to blame Islamic terrorists to secure more funding and power for the department. Charly realizes that a new group is plotting to restage the attack, led by her former boss at the CIA, Leland Perkins ([[Patrick Malahide]]) and a [[Psychological Operations|psychological-operations]] specialist named Timothy ([[Craig Bierko]]), who Charly had a romantic relationship with in the past. She and Mitch head to Niagara Falls, and learn that Timothy has kidnapped Caitlin. Charly implores Timothy not to hurt Caitlin, after realizing that Timothy is actually Caitlin's biological father.  Charly and Mitch attack the staging area, forcing Timothy to launch the attack early; meanwhile Caitlin escapes and accidentally locks herself in a cage on the truck carrying the bomb. Charly chases the truck, overpowers its driver, and diverts it before it overturns on a bridge. Charly frees Caitlin and tells her to clear the bridge, but Timothy's agents prevent her from leaving. Mitch suddenly arrives in a car, picking up Charly and Caitlin before the bomb explodes, killing Timothy and his forces, and destroying the bridge.  In the epilogue, Charly has returned to her assumed identity of Samantha Caine, moving with Caitlin and Hal to a remote farmhouse, and declines an offer from the president to rejoin the CIA. Mitch enjoys the publicity attracted by his role in the crisis, and is seen being interviewed by [[Larry King]] on television, where they discuss Perkins, who was indicted for treason.  
Lone Star (1996 film)
 Sheriff Sam Deeds is the county sheriff in Frontera, Texas. He was born and raised in Frontera, and returned two years ago to be sheriff. Sam's late father had been the legendary Sheriff Buddy Deeds, who is remembered as fair and just. Sam had problems with his father and the pair routinely fought.  Sam is particularly disapproving of efforts by business leader Mercedes Cruz and Buddy's former deputy, Mayor Hollis Pogue, to enlarge and rename the local courthouse in Buddy's honor; he considers it an unneeded waste of taxpayers' money. As a teenager, Sam had been in love with Mercedes's daughter Pilar, but the courtship was strongly opposed by Buddy and Mercedes. After a chance meeting, Sam and the widowed Pilar, now a local teacher, slowly resume their relationship.  Colonel Delmore Payne has recently arrived in town as the commander of the local U.S. Army base. Delmore is the son of Otis "Big O" Payne, a local nightclub owner and leading figure in the area's African-American community. The two are estranged because of Otis's serial infidelity and abandonment of Delmore's mother when Delmore was a child. Relic hunters discover a human skeleton on an old shooting range along with a Masonic ring, a Rio County sheriff's badge, and a bullet not used by the military. Sam brings in Texas Ranger Ben Wetzel to help with the case. Wetzel tells Sam that forensics identify the skeleton as that of Charlie Wade, the corrupt sheriff who preceded Buddy. Wade had mysteriously disappeared in 1957, taking $10,000 in county funds, after which Buddy became sheriff.  Sam investigates the events leading up to Wade's murder. He learns that Wade terrorized the local African-American and Mexican communities, including numerous murders where he asks his innocent victims to dig out any weapon they might have, to then justify shooting them for "resisting arrest".  Wade used this method to murder Cruz's husband, Eladio, in front of Deputy Hollis. Sam visits Wesley Birdsong, a Native American and a roadside tourist stand owner, who reveals that Buddy was a wild young adult who settled down after becoming a deputy sheriff and marrying Sam's mother &ndash; though he did have a mistress, whose name Wesley claims to have forgotten. Sam travels to [[San Antonio]], where he visits his marginally mentally ill ex-wife Bunny and searches through his father's things, where he discovers love letters from Buddy's mistress.  Sam confronts Hollis and Otis about Wade's murder. Wade extorted money from a young Otis for running an illegal gambling operation in the bar, then was about to use his "resisting arrest" setup to kill Otis. Buddy arrived just as Hollis shot Wade to prevent Otis's murder.  The three buried the body and took the $10,000 from the county and gave it to Mercedes &ndash; who was destitute after Eladio's recent death &ndash; to buy her restaurant. Hollis reveals that Buddy and Mercedes did not take up until some time later. Sam decides to drop the issue, saying it will remain an unsolved mystery. Hollis voices concern that, when the skeleton is revealed to be Wade, people will assume Buddy killed him to take his job, to which Sam states that Buddy's legend can handle it.  Sam learns that Hollis and Mercedes have recruited his own deputy to run against him in the next election. He decides to not run for re-election.  Sam tells Pilar that Eladio died 18 months, rather than "a few weeks", before she was born. Sam shows Pilar an old photo of Buddy and Mercedes, revealing that Buddy is her father. Both are hurt over the deception but decide that, since she cannot have any more children, they will continue their romantic relationship, despite the knowledge that they are [[incest|half-siblings]].

Maachis
 The story is set in mid-to-late 1980s in the Indian state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] which had been wrecked by a violent insurgency in the aftermath of [[Operation Blue Star]], the [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|assassination]] of Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], and the subsequent [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots]]. The story is relayed by a series of flashbacks.  Jaswant Singh Randhawa ([[Raj Zutshi]]) and his sister Veerendar "Veeran" ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]) live with their elderly mother Biji in a small village in Punjab. Kripal Singh ([[Chandrachur Singh]]) is Jaswant's childhood friend and Veeran's fiancé. He lives close by, with his grandfather.  Their peaceful lives are interrupted by the police led by [[Assistant Commissioner of Police]] Khurana and Inspector Vohra, searching for Jimmy ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]), who allegedly had attempted to murder Kedar Nath, a member of the [[Indian Parliament]]. Jaswant mockingly leads the police to his dog named Jimmy. Angered by his insolence, Khurana and Vohra take Jaswant for questioning; he fails to return for days. Kripal struggles to locate Jaswant, visiting police stations in the area, while taking care of Jaswant's family. When Jaswant finally returns after 15 days, he has been badly beaten up by police, which enrages Kripal.  Unable to obtain help by any legal means to fight police brutality, Kripal sets off to locate his cousin Jeetay, who had ties with militant groups. Unable to locate Jeetay, Kripal instead encounters a man named Sanathan ([[Om Puri]]), whom he observes planting a time-bomb on a bus. Running into him again at a ''dhabha'', Kripal asks a wary Sanathan to listen to his woes. Sanathan agrees to let Kripal travel with him on his truck being driven by the "Commander" ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]) and carrying sacks of home-made bombs and two militants. Upon arriving at their hideout, Kripal explains his predicament and finds out that Jeetay was killed by the Commander himself for being a police informer. Fully aware of Kripal's background, family and his predicament, the Commander rebukes Kripal for coming to them as if they were professional killers. He tells him to kill Khurana himself and the group would protect him.  Kripal slowly earns the respect of the rest of the group and Sanathan, who explains that he is not fighting for a nationalist or religious cause, but for his basic civil rights and self-respect. Sanathan says that he is fighting against a system that victimises innocents and de-values ordinary people. It is later learned that Sanathan is a survivor of the communal violence that occurred with the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, wherein he lost most of his family in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Sanathan claims that it is the ruling class that is trying to divide society by religion for political gain.  Kripal trains with the group and plots the killing of Khurana. After a year, he assassinates Khurana in a busy marketplace. Before going into hiding, he visits Jaswant and Veeran one final time, both of whom are horrified at his deed. When Kripal returns to their hideout, he finds it empty. After a while of staying in hiding, he is contacted by a member of the group and is taken by the Commander to the group's new hiding place in [[Himachal Pradesh]]. The Commander informs Kripal that he is known to the police, who had taken Jaswant in for questioning again.  Kripal slowly begins to realise that there is no return to a normal life and finds solace in the company the unit, which is now preparing for a new mission and awaiting the arrival of a missile firing specialist. When thinking of applying for a local job, Kripal is warned by Sanathan that he is now a big-time terrorist in the eyes of the media and a means of promotion for police officers. One of the group members, Kuldip, narrowly escapes a confrontation with the police while trying to illegally transporting some explosives, sustaining injuries. Terrified by the experience, he pleads to Sanathan to let him go home, promising to emigrate to Canada. Sanathan reluctantly agrees. While the rest of the unit believes Kuldip is heading home, a bomb planted in his backpack explodes and kills him on his way home.  Meanwhile, Kripal learns that one of his comrades, Jaimal Singh, is none other than the Jimmy the police had been looking for. Soon afterwards, the missile shooter arrives and Sanathan introduces Veerendar. Kripal is shocked to find that Veerendar is his fiancée, Veeran.

Meanwhile, one of the group members spots Kripal entering Vohra's residence. Arguing that if Kripal had been loyal, he would have taken the cyanide pill to kill himself, Sanathan concludes that Kripal was a police informer. Sanathan also accuses Veeran of helping Kripal and orders her into house-arrest. On the day of the mission, Sanathan orders the group to move and tells Waziren, who is guarding Veeran, to kill her. However, Veeran breaks free and kills Waziren. In the meantime, Jaimal and Sanathan execute the plot.

Mickey Holliday is the top enforcer for Vic, the mob boss, who is about to be released from a psychiatric facility. In his absence, Ben London has been running Vic's nightclub while Mickey has been romancing both Rita and Grace Everly, which is doubly dangerous inasmuch as they are sisters and Grace was previously Vic's girl.  A rival, Jake Parker, recruits a number of hired guns in an attempt to seize power. Mickey kills the first to challenge him, Lee Turner. The next one brought in by Parker, identified as Nicholas Falco and supposedly the fastest draw of all, murders Mickey's close friend, Jules Flamingo, who is unarmed.

Marching in Darkness
    The recruit Saro Franzese befriends the sergeant of his squad, Gianni Tricarico, who immediately becomes infatuated with him. The soldier does not welcome or understand his advances, and, after a lively evening at a disco, criticizes the ambiguous and aggressive behavior of his friend. They leave together in Gianni's car, apparently intending to go back to their barracks, but Gianni drives to a road frequented by transsexuals, many of whom he seems to know well. Saro is not interested in the scene and leaves the car, whereupon he accepts a ride in another car with apparently only the driver on board. But Saro comes back soon after being beaten for trying to defend himself and after being raped by the driver.  <p> Saro, wounded and distraught, roams around until he is picked up by Gianni, who, after learning that Captain Silvio Roatta, the commander of their battalion, was one of Saro's attackers, brings him to the hospital of their barracks with the intention to hide what happened; but a day later, a doctor tells him that the soldier cannot stay without official permission and therefore is forced to leave. Gianni then takes Saro to the house of his sister, Paola, where she lives with her husband Mario and their two children. The couple want to know why Saro is in such condition, but Saro refuses to explain and only after a violent outburst does he burst into tears and tell the truth.   <p>Gianni reveals that he has jotted down the licence number of the car that Saro got into on the night of the rape and Saro finds that the licence number is correct. Saro and his sister go to a car showroom, where Saro recognizes the driver: it was Vittorio Scarpa, a sex maniac who is heavily in debt and who because of the aforementioned reasons has a difficult and painful relationship with his wife Gabriella and his son Fabrizio. Once recognized, Scarpa is reported to the police and Gianni's captain subpoenas him to appear as a witness.  <p>Scarpa tells Roatta about the trial, but the captain, who is engaged to Laura, the mayor's daughter, not only already knew about the trial, but also knows the identity of the witness. He reassures Scarpa that the sergeant depends on him; in fact, ever since the moment Gianni arrives, he has been exerting pressure on him and blackmailing him into letting Scarpa continue his life, which means bringing transsexuals into a secret room inside the car showroom where he enjoys his secret pleasures, and also into reporting Saro for slander. After the beginning of the trial process, Paola invites Gianni to dinner to ask for an explanation, but Gianni replies that he is not going to testify against his captain and, when he is left alone with Saro after a heated fight, confesses to being raped when he was thirteen years old and asserts that he will not support him in any case.   <p>The military tribunal has already started the inquiry process and Captain Antonio Marsili is in charge. He first interrogates Saro, who confirms the accusation but is informed that adding to the accusation of slander, he is also subjected to proceedings for retention and for immoral conduct. Later Gianni is called to support the claim that on the night of the alleged rape, he only saw Saro leaving the barracks; after that the captain asks him if there is a relationship between him and Saro, having once seen them "joking" in the barracks. Captain Marsili then informs him of the proceedings that Saro is subjected to; he also summons a carabiniere who is uncertain about the dynamics of the whole incident and tells him that the investigation will still be difficult.   <p>In the meantime, things are not going well in the barracks, either: in fact, Saro is provoked by his fellow soldiers, and Gianni defends him by making him aware of the dangers that run inside the military structure. But the younger man obstinately decides not to drop the charge and even spits in the sergeant's face, whereupon Gianni strikes him by breaking his leg. Marsili visits Saro in the hospital, but the soldier refuses to tell him how the incident happened. When everything seems to work in disfavor for Saro, Scarpa's family unexpectedly offer help: at the hearing, Scarpa's wife bursts into tears, postponing her testimony, while his son breaks his father's alibi by revealing that Scarpa is actually homosexual, addicted to alcohol, and has a violent nature, so that the thirteen hospital admissions of his mother that have come to light are now officially attributed to "domestic incidents". After the hearing, the attitude of Roatta's fiancée, who demands an explanation from him out of suspicion, has also changed, but Roatta punches her with his fist.  <p>Captain Roatta, when he is back in the barracks, talks with Gianni and says that he knows Gianni's attack at Saro was merely a way to turn the younger soldier against him. From that moment onwards, he exerts more pressure on the sergeant, withholding freedom from the platoon and forcing the soldiers to undergo back-breaking night-time drills to turn Gianni's comrades against him. After receiving complaints from Corporal Cau, Roatta states that to make things go back to the way they were, problems will have to be "solved" among themselves. But after meeting with Scarpa, Roatta informs him that if he is left all alone, he will testify against him.   <p>Marsili, in the meantime, continues to collide with Gianni over the sergeant's silence on the subject, threatening to put him on trial as well. Gianni continues to deny the accusation, but reveals that two years before, Roatta's driver, the soldier Granelli, went on leave because of neurasthenia. Once the Captain finishes talking with the younger man, he meets Roatta and tells him that he has taken cognizance of the incident, that it was the sergeant who informed him, and that he will do everything possible to expel him from the army, but Roatta is reassured by the mayor that Saro's lawyer, who is also the mayor's friend, has stepped down from the post, and that, also for an electoral motive, he will support him in spite of his daughter's suspicions.  <p>However, the inquiry continues and Marsili, having been convinced of Roatta's guilt by now, employs a lawyer for Saro. At the same time, Gianni is attacked and stabbed in the shower by three masked soldiers and just then the intervention of Marsili, who is drawn to the scene by Gianni's screams, saves him. Once he is sent to the hospital, Gianni tells Marsili how the attack happened and confesses that he has been behaving angrily towards Saro. The Captain listens to his confession and gets what he needs to incriminate the culprits, but specifies that if Gianni confirms everything, he will be removed from the army. The sergeant consents and, when he is left alone with Saro, apologizes and asks for a kiss.  <p>Scarpa, upon his family's denunciation, is arrested for maltreatment, fraud, and for falsification of accounts, having been heavily indebted to the car dealer. The Captain calls for the remission of Roatta from the army, avoiding in this way the rigidity of the military law, but, disappointed in the high esteem that the officer was placed in, he wishes that the civil law will be inflexible. Marsili, praised by the commander, turns down the promotion nevertheless, remembering Roatta's foreign missions and claiming that he does not want to build his career on the destruction of another officer. At the trial, Gianni confesses everything he has previously confided in the Captain, including the activity of male prostitution. Once he is released, Gianni is greeted by Saro again as his friend; while Roatta, who shows up at the hearing in a camouflage suit, commits suicide with a bayonet before the astonished judge.  
Matilda (1996 film)
 [[Matilda Wormwood]] is a genius, but her parents, Harry and Zinnia, and her brother Michael ignore and mistreat her. Since babyhood, Matilda has displayed incredible learning ability and develops a strong sense of independence due to her often being left alone at home every weekday when her father is at work, her mother is playing bingo, and Michael is at school. To pass the time, Matilda learns the route to the public library to read books.  At age six-and-a-half, Matilda begins to lose patience with her parents, expressing a desire to go to school, which her parents refuse blatantly and mock her. In retaliation for her father constantly berating her, she resolves to punish him each time, first by adding [[hydrogen peroxide]] to his [[Hair care|hair tonic]] to turn his hair an unhealthy blonde, and then [[Cyanoacrylate|super-gluing]] his hat to his head after learning about his corrupt car business. Coincidentally, unlucky things begin to happen around Harry when Matilda gets angry with him. For instance, when reading a borrowed library copy of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', which Harry rips up and makes her watch television instead, her increasing anger causes the television set to suddenly explode, which terrifies Zinnia and leaves Harry bewildered.  Harry finally relents to letting Matilda go to school after meeting a client named [[Agatha Trunchbull]], the tyrannical principal of a rundown elementary school, Crunchem Hall; he sells Trunchbull a faulty car. There, Matilda befriends several children and learns of Trunchbull's violent nature and overly harsh punishments of the students. Thankfully, Matilda's teacher, Jennifer Honey, is a kind woman who adores her class and takes an immediate liking to Matilda's gentle and humble nature despite her incredible genius. She requests to Trunchbull that Matilda be moved up to a higher class, but Trunchbull refuses. That night, Miss Honey pays the Wormwoods a visit to encourage them to spend more time with Matilda, but they snub her. Meanwhile, Matilda discovers that her family is under surveillance by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents Bob and Bill due to her father's illegal dealings, but her parents refuse to believe her, as Zinnia thinks they are speedboat salesmen.  Matilda soon learns about Trunchbull's weekly "checkups" to belittle the students. As a prank, Lavender, one of Matilda's friends, places a newt in Trunchbull's water jug to frighten her. Upon discovery of the newt, Trunchbull accuses Matilda, whose anger at the injustice leads her to telekinetically tip the glass over, splashing water and the newt on Trunchbull. Afterward, Miss Honey invites Matilda to her house for tea. On the way, they pass Trunchbull's house, and Miss Honey reveals a secret of hers: When she was two, her mother died, so her father, Magnus, invited his stepsister-in-law, Trunchbull, to live with them and look after her. However, Trunchbull regularly abused, tormented and berated her. When Miss Honey was five, her father died of an alleged suicide. Eventually, she fled the mansion to escape Trunchbull and purchased a small cottage for herself to live in. She and Matilda sneak into Trunchbull's house while she is out to obtain some of Miss Honey's belongings, but Trunchbull's unexpected return leads to a cat-and-mouse chase, with them only barely escaping without revealing themselves. Matilda begins to think that Magnus was murdered by Trunchbull to obtain his wealth and estate.  When Matilda's telekinetic powers manifest again during an argument with her father, she trains herself to use them at her own will. She returns to Trunchbull's house and uses her telekinesis to wreak havoc in an attempt to scare her away. She almost flees, but Trunchbull finds Matilda's hair ribbon and realizes her presence. The following day, Trunchbull visits Miss Honey's class again to get Matilda to admit her guilt. Matilda magically writes a message on the blackboard, posing as the ghost of Magnus, accusing Trunchbull of murdering him. Trunchbull goes berserk and attacks the students, but Matilda keeps them out of harm's way with her powers. The students then throw food and drinks at Trunchbull, which other students notice; they celebrate by attacking Trunchbull and her car as she flees in terror. Miss Honey subsequently moves back into her father's true home.  The FBI discovers evidence capable of seeing Harry imprisoned, and an arrest warrant is issued for him; the Wormwoods prepare to flee to [[Guam]].

Mars Attacks!
  In [[Kentucky]], a family watches in confusion as a herd of cattle starts running past their home, on fire. A spaceship explodes before it returns to [[Mars]], and hundreds of other [[Martian]] ships leave Mars and head towards Earth. President James Dale, along with his aides, addresses the United States concerning the historic event. The President's science aides set up a [[first contact (science fiction)|first contact]] meeting with the Martians in [[Pahrump, Nevada]] as President Dale watches the development on TV with his wife Marsha and his daughter Taffy.  Using a [[universal translator|translation machine]], the Ambassador of Mars announces that they "come in peace". When a hippie releases a dove as a symbol of peace, the Ambassador shoots it before he and the other Martians slaughter a large number of people at the event, including General Casey, news reporter Jason Stone and Billy-Glenn Norris before capturing chat-show host Nathalie Lake and her pet [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]].  Thinking that the Martians assumed that the dove was a symbol of war, President Dale tells Professor Donald Kessler to renegotiate with the Martians, whose ambassador is invited to address the [[United States Congress]]. At this meeting, the Martians massacre most of Congress. Donald begs the Martian Ambassador to stop, but is rendered unconscious and taken aboard their ship, where he is later shown with his body parts dismembered and his disembodied head remaining animated. General Decker tries to convince President Dale to retaliate with [[nuclear warfare]], but the President refuses.  After a failed attempt to assassinate President Dale, the Martians invade Earth, starting with Washington, D.C. As they attack the White House, the Secret Service evacuates the President, but the First Lady Marsha is crushed to death by the Nancy Reagan [[chandelier]]. Taffy vanishes during the chaos. After the U.S. government unsuccessfully attempts a nuclear attack on the [[mother ship]], the Martians expand their invasion to the rest of the Earth, defacing world landmarks for amusement as they do so. That night, the Martians breach the bunker where Dale has been taken and the leader reduces Decker to the size of an insect before killing him. The Martians kill everyone else in the bunker except for Dale, who makes an impassioned speech in an attempt to plea for peace and his life. The Martians seem convinced, but then use a false hand to kill the President.  As the Martians ravage [[Las Vegas]], Byron Williams, a former world champion boxer, leads a small group of survivors consisting of Barbara Land, [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], a waitress named Cindy, and a lawyer to an airfield in the hopes of flying a small jet to safety. They barely make it, losing the lawyer in the process, but discover a large group of Martians stationed there as they are preparing to take off. Byron creates a diversion by challenging them to a fistfight. While he succeeds in killing the Ambassador, he is outnumbered and overwhelmed, but Tom, Barbara, and Cindy escape.  Billy-Glenn's brother Richie discovers that the Martians' heads explode when they hear [[Slim Whitman]]'s "[[Indian Love Call]]". He and his grandmother Florence drive around town, using the song to kill Martians. The military thereafter broadcast the song around the globe, killing most of the Martians and their leader, and causing the few remaining survivors to try to flee. Nathalie and Donald's disembodied heads kiss while the Martian spaceship they are on crashes into the ocean.  In the aftermath, Richie and Florence are awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] by Taffy, the only surviving member of the government. Byron, who survived the Martian brawl, arrives in D.C. to reunite with his former wife and their two sons as the devastation is being cleaned up. Barbara, Cindy, and Tom Jones emerge from a cave with some animals to see dozens of crashed Martian ships in [[Lake Tahoe]].

Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders
  Although the opening segment implies that Merlin's magical interventions in people's lives are intended to have a [[benign]] effect, in practice this proves to be far from the case.  The first story focuses on a married couple, Jonathan and Madeline Cooper. Jonathan is a respected, though obnoxious columnist, and Madeline is desperate for a baby, as she and Jonathan have been [[Infertility|unable to conceive]]. The couple visit the store, where Jonathan berates Merlin and threatens to write a negative article in the newspaper that will cause his readers to avoid the store. Merlin loans Jonathan his spell book as proof that he is actually the legendary wizard. Jonathan takes the book home and begins to toy with several of the spells. Jonathan becomes convinced of the book's authenticity when an unsuccessful spell to summon a spirit results in him having a vision of [[Satan]] and causing Jonathan to breathe fire. Jonathan quickly grows excited and becomes obsessed with the book's powers, but begins to dramatically [[Aging|age]] due to the rapid depletion of one's [[Energy (esotericism)|life force]] required to cast the spells. Jonathan attempts to transform his pet cat into a mystical servant, but it becomes demonic and proceeds to attack him. Using the spell from earlier, Jonathan breathes fire and burns the cat alive. By then, Jonathan has aged so severely that his hair is white and receded. Jonathan retrieves the book's [[Rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] spell and proceeds to create the required potion. He takes a sample of Madeline's blood and adds it to the mixture. Jonathan drinks the potion, but the spell backfires: Jonathan regresses into [[infancy]]. Madeline happily decides to raise her former husband as her own child.  In the second story, which bears a very close resemblance to [[Stephen King]]'s short story "[[The Monkey]]", a thief steals a cymbal-banging-monkey toy from Merlin's shop, and sells it to a novelty store, where it is quickly bought as a present for a young boy. Every time the monkey's cymbals are struck, a nearby living thing dies. The boy's father takes the monkey and attempts to bury it, but it finds its way back into the boy's house. But before the monkey's cymbals are struck again, Merlin shows up and takes the toy back to his shop.

The Mirror Has Two Faces

When her attractive sister, Claire (Rogers), starts making preparations for her third wedding to Alex (Brosnan), who used to date her, she begins to feel her loveless life is empty.  Gregory Larkin (Bridges), a Columbia [[Mathematics]] teacher, feels sex complicates matters between men and women, since he seems to lose all his rational perspective as soon as he is aroused. After his last girlfriend dumps him after a last one night stand before she gets married, he decides to look for a relationship based on the intellectual rather than the physical, based on a suggestion by a sex-phone service, and places an ad in a newspaper.   Claire reads the ad and answers on behalf of Rose. Gregory is intrigued when Claire tells him that Rose teaches English literature at Columbia, so he creeps in to her lecture about chaste love in literature, missing entirely the point she was making. After a series of mishaps, they begin dating and he is impressed by her wit and knowledge and seems to be fascinated by her quirks and mannerisms, which usually drive people crazy. She is also fascinated by the dashing math professor and even helps him improve his teaching techniques. He proposes marriage, on condition that it will be largely platonic, with occasional sex only if she needs it. The prospect of spending the rest of her life as a lonely spinster living with Hannah seems far worse than a marriage on those conditions, so she accepts.  Rose's attraction to Gregory grows, and one night she attempts to seduce him, much to his annoyance. He had hoped that by then she had given up on the idea of sex, though he admits he initially raised its possibility. He abruptly breaks off their attempt at physical intimacy when he finds himself becoming truly aroused and fears that it will change the safe comfortable feelings he has towards her.  When Gregory departs on a lengthy lecture tour, Rose embarks on a crash course in self-improvement: she diets, exercises, changes her hairstyle, learns to use [[Cosmetics|makeup]], and outfits herself in an updated wardrobe. When Gregory returns, he finds a very different woman waiting for him and is too startled to express his feelings. She admits that she made a mistake in accepting their passionless marriage, and leaves him. All the while, she realizes that everyone, including herself, is now behaving differently towards her altered self, though not always to her liking. Gregory and Rose realize their mutual love has been hindered, not by her appearance, but by his unusual theories on marriage and sex, and finally recognize their deep affection.

 In 1922, Joe O'Reilly attempts to console Kitty Kiernan, who is mourning the death of Michael Collins.  At the end of the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916, Collins, Harry Boland, Éamon de Valera, and other survivors surrender to the [[British Army]]. As the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]]'s "G" Division identifies the leaders, Collins tells Boland that next time, "We won't play by their rules, Harry. We'll invent our own." All the other leaders die by firing squad, but de Valera, an American citizen, is imprisoned in England. Collins, Boland, and the others are sent to [[Frongoch internment camp]].  After his release, Collins gives a speech at an election rally at the [[South Longford by-election, 1917]]. Collins is injured when the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] break up the rally, but is rescued by Boland. While recovering on a friend's farm, they meet Kitty, who begins a romance with Boland. Collins is tipped off by Detective Ned Broy that the British plan to arrest de Valera and his Cabinet. However, de Valera forbids anyone to go into hiding, stating that the ensuing public outcry will force their immediate release. Only Collins and Boland escape arrest and imprisonment, and there are no protests. Boland and Collins travel to England and break de Valera out of Lincoln prison. Angry that Collins has overshadowed him, de Valera announces that he will travel to the United States to seek recognition from [[Woodrow Wilson]], and orders Boland to accompany him. Before they depart, Collins suggests to Boland his belief that de Valera fears leaving them alone together.  Left in command, Collins orders the IRA to begin raiding police barracks for weapons. He also issues a statement that all collaboration with the British will be punished by death. Collins then recruits a squad from the IRA's Dublin Brigade, which, on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]], assassinates fourteen British agents. In retaliation, the [[Black and Tans]] fire into the crowd at a [[Gaelic football]] match at [[Croke Park]]. Broy is caught burning documents, and is tortured and killed.  After returning from America empty-handed, de Valera decrees that the IRA must make a formal military attack on [[The Custom House]]. Collins argues that fighting conventionally will allow the British to win, but the Cabinet votes to support de Valera. The attack fails catastrophically, leaving six men dead and seventy captured. In the aftermath, Collins declares that the IRA can only hold out for a month. In private, he tells Boland that the IRA will be lucky to hold out for another week. To his surprise, however, the British soon call for a cease fire.  De Valera orders Collins to go to London to participate in negotiations with the British, despite Collins's objections that he is not a diplomat. After the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in December 1921, de Valera erupts upon learning that the terms have been published without his agreement. Collins argues that the Treaty gives them the freedom to achieve the Republic, albeit at the expense of six of the nine Ulster counties. De Valera and his supporters resign in protest after the Dáil approves the Treaty 64–57. Both Collins and de Valera try to sway the Irish people in their respective directions. Collins is attacked by an anti-Treaty Republican during a rally, but escapes. In the aftermath, he successfully proposes to Kitty.  When the people vote to approve the Treaty, de Valera refuses to accept the results and orders the IRA to seize the [[Four Courts]] in Dublin. Ordered by the Cabinet to retake the Four Courts, Collins (now Chief of Staff of the [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]]) is appalled at having to fight former comrades. Arthur Griffith informs him that, if the Irish Free State Army will not deal with the IRA, the British Army will. In the subsequent [[Battle of Dublin]], the IRA is driven from the city. Despite Collins' attempts to capture him, Boland is shot by a sentry while trying to swim the [[River Liffey|Liffey]].  Devastated by Boland's death, Collins travels to County Cork. He reaches out to de Valera through an intermediary, asking for a peace conference. Without de Valera's knowledge, the intermediary informs Collins that de Valera will meet him at [[Béal na Bláth]] the following day. As a convoy of Irish Army vehicles approaches they find a cart laid across the road and IRA men open fire from a nearby hillside. Collins is shot after breaking cover from behind an armoured car. Joe O'Reilly tries to revive Collins but is unsuccessful. Kitty is informed of his death just after trying on her wedding gown.  Completing his story, O'Reilly tells Kitty that Collins would not want her to mourn as long as she has.  
Milk & Money
   
Mission: Impossible (film)
  Years after the events of the series, [[Jim Phelps]] and his team, the [[Impossible Missions Force]] (IMF), attempt to retrieve the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[non-official cover]] (NOC) list from the American embassy in [[Prague]]. Their mission fails: Phelps is shot, his wife Claire dies in a car bombing, and the rest of the team except [[Ethan Hunt]] are eliminated by unknown assassins. Meeting with IMF director Eugene Kittridge, Hunt reveals his awareness of a second IMF team sent to monitor them, and learns the job was a setup to lure out a mole within IMF, who is believed to be working with an arms dealer known as "Max" as part of "Job 314." As Hunt is the only member left, Kittridge suspects him of being the mole, and Hunt flees.  Returning to the Prague safe house, Hunt realizes "Job 314" refers to Bible verse [[Book of Job|Job]] 3:14, "Job" being the mole's code name. Claire arrives at the safe house, explaining she escaped the bomb after Phelps aborted the mission. Hunt arranges a meeting with Max, and warns her that the list she possesses has a tracking device. He promises to deliver the real list in return for $10 million and Job's identity. Hunt, Max, and her agents escape just as a CIA team arrives.  Hunt recruits two disavowed IMF agents: computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Franz Krieger. They infiltrate [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|CIA headquarters]] in [[Langley, Virginia|Langley]], steal the real list, and flee to [[London]]. Kittridge, detecting the theft, has Hunt's mother and uncle falsely arrested for drug trafficking. He provides media coverage of the arrest, forcing Hunt to contact him from [[Liverpool Street station|Liverpool Street Station]]. Hunt allows the CIA to trace him to London before hanging up, but is surprised to find Phelps nearby. Phelps recounts surviving the shooting, naming Kittridge as the mole. Hunt realizes Phelps is the mole, having discovered that Phelps stole a [[Gideons]] Bible from a Chicago hotel. He also suspects Krieger as the one who killed the other IMF members on the Prague job, but is unsure whether Claire was involved. Hunt arranges with Max to exchange the list aboard the [[TGV]] train to Paris the next day.  On the train, Hunt remotely directs Max to the list. Max verifies it and gives Hunt the code to a briefcase containing the payment along with Job in the baggage car. Ethan calls Claire and tells her to meet him there. Meanwhile, Stickell uses a jamming device to prevent Max from uploading the data to her servers. Claire reaches the baggage car, finds Phelps and tells him Ethan will arrive shortly. She questions the idea of killing Ethan, since they will need a fall guy for the money, when Phelps reveals himself to be Ethan in disguise, exposing her as a co-conspirator. When the real Phelps arrives and takes the money at gunpoint, Hunt dons a pair of video glasses that relays Phelps to Kittridge, blowing Phelps' cover as the mole.  Phelps threatens to kill Ethan, but shoots Claire instead when she intervenes. He climbs to the roof of the train, where Krieger is waiting with a helicopter and a tether. Hunt connects the tether to the train itself, forcing the helicopter into the [[Channel Tunnel]] after the train. Hunt places an explosive chewing gum on the helicopter windshield, killing Krieger and Phelps. Kittridge arrests Max and recovers the list, then reinstates Hunt and Stickell as IMF agents, but Hunt is unsure if he'll accept. As he flies home, a flight attendant approaches him and asks, through a coded phrase, if he is ready to take on a new mission, just as she asked Phelps at the beginning.

 Al McCord is hanging out at his favourite restaurant when he meets an attractive young woman, Ellie, who is looking for a ride from the city into the [[Mojave Desert]], where her mother Julie lives.

Strange events follow and it's up to Al to find an explanation.  In the desert, Al's car develops a flat tire. He opens the trunk and discovers an apparent dead body (Ellie's boyfriend Kaiser, whom Al had not yet been aware of). Al heads to a gas station for repairs, following a near run-in with a highway patrolman, when he is interrupted by an attempted robbery. The confusion created by the gun-happy gas station worker allows Al to escape unhurt.  Back home, Al is visited by Ellie, followed by Julie. Unknown to him at this point, his car is being stolen. Outside they notice Boyd and flee to a nearby motel. Just after Al leaves to search for his car, Boyd arrives at the motel, taking the women back to Mojave and locking them in a shed.  Al and actor buddy Sal mount a rescue mission but are themselves knocked out by Boyd. Kaiser, still alive, arrives at Mojave unseen as Boyd drives off with Al, Sal, Julie and Ellie in the car atop his truck, intending on tipping the car and passengers over the edge of a quarry. They eventually escape uninjured while Boyd plummets to his doom, signaled by an ostentatious explosion.  Ellie returns to [[Los Angeles]] with Sal, while Al remains for the night, at least, with Julie.

Mother Night (film)
  Confined in an [[Israel]]i jail, Howard W. Campbell, Jr. writes a memoir about his career in [[Nazi Germany]]. During the buildup to [[World War II]], Campbell, an American playwright of [[German language]] stage productions, is approached by [[U.S. War Department|War Department]] operative Frank Wirtanen. Wirtanen asks Campbell to work as a spy for the U.S. in the approaching war, though he promises no reward or recognition. Campbell rejects the offer, but Wirtanen adds that he wants Campbell to take some time to consider, telling him that Campbell's answer will come in the form of how he acts and what positions he assumes once the war begins.  In the initial stages of the war, Campbell works his way up through [[Joseph Goebbels]]' propaganda organization, eventually becoming the "voice" of [[English language]] broadcasts propagating Nazism and [[anti-Semitism]] at U.S. citizens. Unknown to the Nazis, all of the idiosyncrasies of his speech &ndash; deliberate pauses, coughing, etc. &ndash; form a secret code that covertly transmits information to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces. Late in the war, after his wife, Helga, is reported killed on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], Campbell visits her family in early 1945 outside [[Berlin]], just before the [[Red Army]] arrives. Helga's younger sister, Resi, confesses that she is in love with him.  Eventually, Campbell is captured when a U.S. infantryman recognizes his voice. Before he can be executed, Wirtanen arranges for Campbell's discreet release and helps his relocation to [[New York City]].  Campbell is shocked to learn that the Americans will not reveal Campbell's true role in the war, because that would also reveal the [[Espionage|spycraft]] techniques that America may continue to need for the next [[Cold War|war]].  Although that means that Campbell is doomed to be a pariah, Wirtanen is unsympathetic, reasoning that Campbell would not have wanted the truth known had Germany won the war.  In New York City, Campbell lives a lonely existence for fifteen years, sustained only by memories of Helga and an indifferent curiosity about his eventual fate. Mrs. Epstein, a [[Holocaust]] survivor living in Campbell's building, is the only person who suspects his true identity; he seems to avoid her suspicions by feigning ignorance of German. Campbell's only friend is George Kraft, an elderly painter who, through an extraordinary coincidence, happens to be a [[Soviet intelligence]] agent.  Over many games of chess, Campbell reveals his secret past to Kraft, who tries to use this information to improve his standing with his handlers by forcing Campbell into a position where he must flee to [[Moscow]]. He leaks information about Campbell's whereabouts, which gets the attention of a [[neo-Nazi]] organization. Representatives of this group meet Campbell and present him with who seems to be Helga. However, it is not long before Campbell discovers that Helga is actually Resi, who had taken Helga's identity to escape [[East Germany]].  The neo-Nazis shelter Campbell, along with Kraft and Resi, in their Manhattan hideout. Wirtanen reappears, warning Campbell of Kraft's true identity and explaining that Kraft and Resi have put Campbell in an awkward position with the neo-Nazis to ensure his transfer to Moscow. Campbell returns to the hideout to confront the pair; in light of her exposure, Resi commits suicide. Moments later, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] raids the hideout but, again, Wirtanen uses his influence to ensure Campbell walks free. Campbell returns to his wrecked apartment and decides to turn himself in to the Israelis to stand trial.  Campbell is taken to [[Haifa]], where he is incarcerated in the cell below an unrepentant [[Adolf Eichmann]]. The film ends with the arrival of a letter from Wirtanen providing the corroborating evidence that Campbell was indeed a U.S. spy during the war. Moments later, Campbell hangs himself &mdash; not, he says, for crimes against humanity, but rather for "crimes against myself."  
Mother (1996 film)
 John Henderson ([[Albert Brooks]]) is a successful [[science fiction]] writer who is finalizing his second divorce. He is perplexed by the issues he has with women, realizing that none of them supported or encouraged him. John decides to initiate an experiment that will help him understand what went wrong in his relationships: he moves back in with his widowed mother Beatrice ([[Debbie Reynolds]]), occupying the same bedroom he had as a child. His sports agent brother Jeff thinks John is oversensitive to their mother's criticisms, while John believes that their mother favors Jeff.   John's relationship with his mother is characterized by constant bickering and power struggles; both are perfectionists strongly committed to their respective points of view. John believes she's overly critical of him, while Beatrice contends that he unfairly blames her for his personal failings. A rare bright spot in their relationship appears when she takes an interest in John's word processor and impresses him with her fast, flawless typing. Beatrice seems surprised by his interest in her life but is reluctant to discuss it.  When Beatrice cancels her plans to visit Jeff, he has a meltdown and an argument with his wife over his need to keep in constant contact with his mother. Jeff's wife tells him that he may needs to evaluate his relationship with his mother just as much as John. John and Beatrice go to the zoo, where they finally reach some common ground. When they return home, Jeff is waiting; upset by the aborted visit, he came to talk Beatrice into visiting for the weekend. All three argue and Jeff leaves alone, with John satisfied that Jeff's the "sickie" while John is "pretty darn healthy to begin with."  Beatrice tells John that she has a friend, Charles, who comes through San Francisco every few weeks and stays over a few days, but while John is there this visit will be just for one day. John is surprised that she would call someone she is intimate with not important, but she dismisses it, saying they "just have sex occasionally". John meets Charles, who knows a lot about John because, as he tells John, Beatrice brags about him when he's not around. Beatrice and Charles go to dinner; in the car they discuss the evening, with Beatrice refusing to have anything more than dinner because of her son's visit.  While alone at the house, John discovers a box of novel and short story manuscripts that his mother wrote in her youth. He learns she was a skilled writer who went to college on a scholarship, only to have her talent discouraged by her husband and the prevailing social expectation that mothers should not have careers outside the home. John realizes now that his mother's [[passive aggression]] toward him stems from the fact that his career is a reminder of her unfulfilled ambitions. Beatrice admits that John's observation is correct, leading to a warm reconciliation.  The film ends with John meeting a single female fan of his novels, and Beatrice beginning to write a story based on John's moving in with her.

Multiplicity (film)
 Doug Kinney ([[Michael Keaton]]) is a [[Los Angeles]] construction worker whose job is constantly getting in the way of his family. On one job to build a new wing of a scientific facility, Doug meets up with Dr. Leeds ([[Harris Yulin]]), a friendly scientist who has developed a successful method for [[human cloning|cloning humans]]. Doug is introduced to Dr. Leeds' clone as proof. Dr. Leeds is sympathetic to Doug's troubles, so he allows Doug to clone himself so that the clone can take over for Doug at work, while the original Doug tries to spend some quality time with his family. The clone, called "Two" (although he calls himself "Lance"), has all of Doug's memories and knowledge, but his personality is an exaggeration of Doug's masculine side and he is especially [[machismo|macho]]. Doug does not reveal the cloning to his family and he goes to great lengths to keep it a secret. Although the clone seems to be a dream come true, while Doug and his wife Laura ([[Andie MacDowell]]) are at a restaurant for dinner, Doug finds that Two is on his own date (due to not being allowed to be with Laura). Doug realizes clones are not as great as they seem, and Doug begins to worry about his clone being revealed.  Despite the complications of having a clone, Lance is extremely busy at work so Doug decides to have another made to help out at home.  "Three" (who calls himself "Rico") is a sharp contrast to Lance and is an exaggeration of Doug's feminine side. He has an extremely sensitive and thoughtful personality. He is much like a [[housewife]] and loves to cook and take care of the house, much to Lance's chagrin.   However, things take a turn for the worse when Lance and Rico introduce "Four" (who refers to Doug as "Steve", and is later himself named Lenny).  Lance and Rico decided to make another clone and he is cloned from Two/Lance, and has the mentality of an overly-curious child. Unfortunately, since he is a clone-of-a-clone, his IQ is considerably lower than that of his predecessors, and the personality defects are more pronounced when a clone is cloned (the analogy from the movie refers to how [[generation loss|a copy of a copy may not be as 'sharp' as the original]]). This causes an annoyed Doug to decree that no more clones of him/them be created.   Doug decides to take some time off and goes on a sailing trip.  He doesn't want Laura to know, so he has his clones step in for him and take his place while he's away.  However, he specifically instructs them that Laura is off limits. While he is gone, each of the clones, in turn, run into Laura and, despite their best efforts to follow instructions (one plays sick, etc), she persists and eventually has sex with all three of them thinking they're Doug.   The next day, Lance has a [[common cold|cold]] and is unable to go to work, so he sends Rico. During an inspection on site, Rico's lack of knowledge about the current construction site annoys and upset the inspector, which leads to Doug losing his job.  As time passes, Doug's wife becomes increasingly upset with her husband's erratic behavior, as she is wondering about Doug's sudden personality changes throughout the day and how Doug continually has no memories of discussions Laura unwittingly had with another clone. Thinking Doug is ignoring her, she reveals her feelings to Lenny, mentioning how Doug has never kept his promise to fix up the house. When she asks him what he wants, an inattentive Lenny replies, "I want pizza". Upset, she takes the children and leaves, moving to stay at her parents' home. When Doug returns, he learns that Laura and the kids have left. He also learns from the clones' confessions that he has lost his job and each one of them has had sex with Laura.   While Doug tries to determine how to get Laura back, Lenny tells him about what Laura told Lenny about how he never fixed the house. With the help of the clones, Doug remodels the house and wins back the love of his wife. Doug also tells Laura he is planning to start his own construction business. Realizing Doug can take care of himself now, the three clones move away.  As they are driving away and stopped at a stoplight, Laura finally sees the three clones in the car next to her. Believing that she is [[hallucination|hallucinating]], Laura tells her children that you can tell you really love someone when everyone you see reminds you of them.   The clones write to Doug that they have set up a successful [[pizzeria]] called "Three Guys from Nowhere" in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] and are masquerading as triplets. Lance becomes the businessman of the shop and serves customers, enjoying this opportunity to meet many women. Rico is the head [[chef]] and is "cooking up a storm and having a ball", and Lenny is the [[delivery boy]] as well as taking a second job as a [[paperboy (newspaper delivery)|paperboy]].  Unfortunately, Lenny confuses the two and is seen delivering pizzas by throwing the box onto the lawn as he rides his bike by.  
Mulholland Falls
 In the early 1950s, a four-man squad of unorthodox [[Los Angeles Police Department]] detectives begins throwing its weight around by tossing Jack Flynn, an organized crime figure from Chicago, off a cliff on [[Mulholland Drive]], nicknamed "Mulholland Falls" for all the men they have thrown off it.  Detective Lieutenant Maxwell Hoover and his partners Coolidge, Hall, and Relyea are called to investigate a suspicious death of a young woman found at a construction site. The evidence shows that every bone in her body is broken. A coroner deduces that she looks like she "jumped off a cliff," although there are no cliffs nearby. The woman turns out to be someone Hoover knew very well, Allison Pond.  The detectives receive a film of Allison having sex in a motel room, taken by a secretly hidden camera behind a two-way mirror. Allison's gay friend Jimmy Fields admits to making this film and more, including one with Hoover in it. Fields is murdered while being guarded by Hall and Relyea.  Radioactive glass is found in Allison's foot, which leads the detectives to the [[Nevada Test Site]], where they illegally break in and investigate. Colonel Fitzgerald threatens to lock up the police officers, warning them that they have no authority here. The man in the film with Allison proves to be the civilian commander of the secret base, retired General Thomas Timms, now head of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], who admits the affair to Hoover but has an alibi for the day of her death.  Max's marriage to Kate is jeopardized by someone desperate to retrieve the film. An FBI agent fails to persuade the LAPD's Chief to drop the case, so Lt. Hoover's house is ransacked by FBI men with a search warrant, but no film is found. Hoover brutally assaults the FBI agent, after which a film is delivered to Kate showing her husband and Allison having sex in the motel.  The blackmailer turns out to be Colonel Fitzgerald, who demands the film of Timms with Allison be brought to him. Hoover realizes that Jimmy Fields' film footage of Allison also includes images of "atomic soldiers" used as guinea pigs for A-bomb tests, now dying in a secret hospital ward on Timms' military base. Hoover and partner Ellery Coolidge fly to the base, where Max brings the film to Timms, who is terminally ill with cancer himself.  For their return trip to Los Angeles, Max and Coolidge board a [[Douglas DC-3|C-47]] cargo plane, where they are joined by Colonel Fitzgerald and his aide. During the flight, Max realizes that Fitzgerald is going to kill them by throwing them off the airplane in mid-air, the same way that Allison Pond died. In a vicious struggle, the detectives fight for their lives. Coolidge charges the aide as gunshots go off. Coolidge and Max are able to throw the aide and Fitzgerald out of the plane, both falling to their death. The pilot is also accidentally shot but manages to crash land before he dies. Coolidge celebrates the landing until realizing that he, too, has been shot, also dying at the scene.  Max cannot reconcile with his wife at Coolidge's funeral because she feels betrayed and heartbroken. At the cemetery, where he explains that his unit has been disbanded, she walks out on Max for good.  
Mrs. Winterbourne
 On her 18th birthday, Connie Doyle ([[Ricki Lake]]) meets lowlife Steve DeCunzo ([[Loren Dean]]). She moves in with him and winds up pregnant. He kicks her out when she won't get rid of the baby, denying responsibility. Months later, a destitute Connie gets inadvertently swept aboard a train at [[Grand Central Terminal]]. With no ticket and no money, Connie is rescued by Hugh Winterbourne ([[Brendan Fraser]]), who takes her to his private compartment. She meets his wife, Patricia, ([[Susan Haskell]]) who is also pregnant. Patricia and Connie bond, and Patricia shows Connie her wedding band, which has the couple's names engraved on the inside. Patricia encourages Connie to try the ring on. When the train suddenly crashes, Patricia is thrown outside, leaving Connie the only one in the private compartment.  Eight days later, Connie wakes up in the hospital to discover she has given birth to a baby boy. Connie was found in the Winterbourne's sleeper car wearing the wedding band, and has been mistaken for Patricia.  She also learns "the other pregnant woman on the train" (Patricia, mistaken for Connie) and Hugh both died in the crash. She tries to explain, but is prevented from doing so by the hospital staff, who believe her to be hysterical. Hugh's mother, Grace ([[Shirley MacLaine]]), who has a bad heart, had never met Patricia before, and so assumes Connie is Patricia.  Grace calls asking Connie to come to the Winterbourne estate. With nowhere else to go, Connie accepts the offer and is driven there by Paco ([[Miguel Sandoval]]), the loyal Cuban chauffeur. There, Connie meets Bill (also played by Fraser), Hugh's [[identical twin]] brother. When the shock of seeing the twin of the man she is claiming as her deceased husband wears off, she nervously begins her new life. She names her newborn son Hughie, after his supposed father. Her new life is very different, and she finds it difficult to adjust. She is helped by Grace, who accepts anything she does, and gives her a socialite make-over.  Meanwhile, since the police think that Patricia was Connie, they tell Steve that Connie and his unborn baby have died. Steve doesn't really seem to care, which disturbs his new girlfriend ([[Cathryn de Prume]]).  Bill questions Connie closely, suspicious of inconsistencies in her story. Annoyed by this, Grace forces Connie on Bill one day, and Bill and Connie walk around Boston, and begin to bond. During the day, Connie accidentally signs her real name, which Bill notices. He investigates, learning her real identity. Bill prepares to expose Connie when he learns that Grace plans to change her will to include Connie and baby Hughie. However, he changes his mind when Connie becomes upset and begs Grace not to include her and Hughie in the will, proving to him that Connie is not after the family's money. Connie's protests make Grace want to include them even more and the will is signed. Bill and Connie are then called to help a drunk Paco, heart-broken from a recent failed romance, to his bed. He demands that Bill and Connie dance a [[tango (dance)|tango]] before he will fall asleep. They do so, and end up sharing several kisses. Grace meets a love-struck Bill as he is leaving, and, hearing him confess concern over what Hugh would think if Bill has feelings for Hugh's (possible) widow, assures him that his brother would want him to be happy.  Connie receives an anonymous letter asking "Who are you? And whose baby is that?" She has been feeling guilty for taking advantage of Grace's (and now Bill's) kindness, but worries that any revelation of the truth would endanger Grace's life. Connie decides to leave with Hughie, and is found packing by Bill. Bill attempts to convince her to stay, proposing to her. He tells her to think about it overnight. Connie decides to run away anyway. Paco follows her to the train station, tells her about his own shady past, and makes her realize she and the baby are just as valuable to Grace as Grace is to them. Connie returns home to find Grace has had a heart attack because of her sudden disappearance. She and Grace talk about Bill's proposal, and Grace tells Connie to never take the baby away again. Connie decides to accept the situation, and agrees to marry Bill as Patricia Winterbourne.  Steve saw a publicity shot of Connie as Patricia, and sent her that letter. He blackmails her to meet with him the next day, or else he will go to Grace, possibly giving her another heart attack. Grace, seeing Connie's distress from afar, sends Paco after Steve as he leaves, to discover his identity. At Steve's motel, Connie writes him a check to leave her and the baby alone, but Steve only wants it to force her into a worse scheme - pretending to kidnap Hughie, ransoming him back. If Connie goes to the police, Steve will use the check as proof that Connie approached him with the idea. Connie, terrified that Grace will die if she is frightened about Hughie being kidnapped, returns to the estate, and steals a pistol from a display case, then returns to the motel to frighten Steve into returning the incriminating check. She does not at first realize that Steve is already dead, and the pistol accidentally goes off when she finds out. Bill rushes in on the echo of the gunshot, and both Bill and Connie deny causing Steve's death. Connie talks Bill out of calling the police, and searches briefly for her own check. Failing to find it, she and Bill flee the scene, not knowing that Paco sees their flight from outside the motel. It is then that Connie begins to tell Bill about the lie she has been living, but Bill reveals that he already knows Connie's true identity, and that he loves her anyway.  The next day, which happens to be their wedding day, the priest ([[Peter Gerety]]) tells Bill and Connie that Grace is outside the church, confessing to Steve's murder to the police lieutenant ([[Debra Monk]]) who came asking for Patricia Winterbourne. They rush to Grace's side, and each confesses to the murder themselves, trying to shield the others. Paco arrives in time to add his confession to the mix.  The police officers tell them they already have the murderer in custody. They only came to the church to question Connie about her check to Steve. The murderer was the woman Steve started seeing after dumping Connie. Like Connie, she had gotten pregnant and Steve had abandoned her.  Connie confesses the truth about Hughie's parentage to Grace, who says she'll still accept Connie and Hughie, adding that she'd like more grandchildren.  The wedding goes ahead, and Bill presents Connie with a wedding ring that has 'Bill & Connie' engraved on the inside (of course, the ring she wore in the hospital had 'Hugh & Patricia' in it). Thus Connie, who had been pretending to be Mrs. Winterbourne, finally becomes a real Mrs. Winterbourne.  
Mr. Wrong
 The film begins with Martha Alston (DeGeneres) in a wedding gown [[Incarceration|incarcerated]] in a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[prison]]. The investigators call her Mrs. Crawford and listen to her explain why she committed [[murder]] on her [[Wedding|wedding day]].  Some months earlier, Martha attends her younger sister's wedding. Afterwords, Martha is pestered by her overbearing parents about when she will get married herself being 31-years-old with her biological clock ticking. Martha works as an associate producer for a local TV talk show in San Diego. She rejects an offer of going out on a date with a younger co-worker, named Walter (John Livingston). Disappointed by her dull [[Valentine's Day]] [[wikt:blind date|blind date]], she goes home to [[wikt:sulk|sulk]] in front of the TV, where, inundated by romantic imagery, she is prompted to get out of the house.  Martha goes to a bar where she drops her [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] in front of the [[jukebox]]. She bends down to get it when a man shows up and selects the same song she would have chosen. He is Whitman Crawford (Pullman), and they instantly hit it off. They go back to his house and have sex. He says he's a [[poet]] and an [[investor]], and has money. He reads her one of his poems.  Whitman appears charming and charismatic in which he and Martha begin dating. Martha introduces Whitman to her family and he impresses all of them. But by the time she meets his strange and eccentric mother (Plowright), Martha has become convinced he is not "Mr. Right" at all. After Martha tells Whitman that it is OK to "be himself" around her, he suddenly breaks character and shoplifts a six-pack of beer from a local store and enjoys crushing the empty beer cans on his forehead. It it here that Whitman is revealed to be a crafty, devious, narcissistic, sociopath who hides behind a charming nice-guy persona that fools literally everyone he comes into contact with. To make matters worse, Whitman's ex-girlfriend, Inga ([[Joan Cusack]]) (who is nearly as crazy and deranged as Whitman), and her [[accomplice]], Bob ([[Brad William Henke]]), begin [[Harassment|harassing]] Martha who decides to break up with Whitman. Inga refuses to believe that Martha has dumped Whitman. Whitman also refuses to believe he has been dumped and he begins [[stalking]] Martha and trying to woo her back in increasingly ridiculous ways. Martha soon becomes frustrated and desperate after the manipulative Whitman tells her whole smitten and oblivious family that they are engaged to be married. He even buys off her private investigator ([[Dean Stockwell]]) that she hires to make a background check on him. All of Martha's attempts to expose Whitman as the dangerous sociopath that he is to her friends and family is met with disbelief and skepticism from everyone due to his skill of lying and manipulation. Whitman goes as far as to make Martha loose her job, and then hits her with his pickup truck, drugs her and abducts her to [[Mexico]] to marry her there by hiring two young Mexican children to hold her captive as they travel on the road to their destination.  Once in Mexico, Martha attempts to escape once and manages to place a phone call to San Diego to her former office to the only person that has not fallen under Whitman's influence: her co-worker Walter whom she manages to tell him briefly that Whitman has abducted her to Mexico and to come to her rescue before Whitman catches up to her and disconnects the call. Then, Inga and Bob appear and attempt to kill Martha, until Whitman comes to Martha's rescue and manages to drive them away at gunpoint.  At the church where Whitman is forcing Martha to get married in front of her deluded family, Walter shows up at the last minute to rescue Martha from the wedding, but trips. His gun falls into her hands and she shoots Whitman who attempts to lunge at her. Then she's arrested, which leads to Martha telling the local authorities her entire story. However, even the Mexican investigators are unsympathetic and conclude that she murdered Whitman intentionally. As they are transporting her away, Walter springs her out of jail with Bob's help and explains that it was Inga who did it; she attempted to kill Martha from the church balcony, but when Martha tripped, Inga hit Whitman by accident. Walter claims that Whitman is still alive at a local hospital and he will recover from his wound.  After meeting up with Bob in the desert, Martha and Walter ride a horse west towards the sunset, while Bob leaves to return to Inga. Title cards over the closing scene explain that Martha and Walter eventually turned north and returned to the USA where they got romantically involved and currently live under assumed names, Inga and Bob got married and opened a pet store in [[Albuquerque]], and Whitman continues his search for love.

Muppet Treasure Island
 [[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]] is a young orphan who lives in the ''Admiral Benbow'' in England with his best friends [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] and [[Rizzo the Rat|Rizzo]]. Jim listens to the tales of [[Billy Bones]] about the pirate [[Captain Flint]], who buried his treasure trove on a remote island and executed his crew so only he would own the island's map. One night, Bones' crewmate Blind Pew arrives, giving Bones the [[Black Spot (Treasure Island)|black spot]]. Bones gives Jim the [[treasure map]] and reveals that he had been Flint's [[first mate]]. Just before dying of a heart attack, he begs Jim to go after the treasure and keep both it and the map safe from pirate hands. An army of pirates attack the inn, destroying it, but Jim, Gonzo, and Rizzo escape with the map.  The trio takes the map to the half-wit [[Squire Trelawney]] ([[Fozzie Bear]]), who arranges a voyage to find the treasure. The boys are enlisted aboard the ''Hispaniola'' as cabin boys, accompanied by Trelawney, [[Dr. Livesey (character)|Dr. Livesey]] ([[Bunsen Honeydew]]), and [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]]. The ship is commanded by [[Captain Alexander Smollett|Captain Abraham Smollett]] ([[Kermit the Frog]]) and his overly strict first mate, Mr. Arrow ([[Sam Eagle]]). The boys meet the cook [[Long John Silver]], a one-legged man whom Bones warned them of, but Jim and Silver become good friends. The ship sets sail, but Smollett is suspicious of the crew, believing them to be of shady character. After Gonzo and Rizzo are kidnapped and tortured by three of the crew who have turned out to be pirates, he has the treasure map locked up for safe keeping.  It is revealed that Silver and the secret pirates in the crew had been part of Flint's crew and want the treasure for themselves. Silver fools Mr. Arrow into leaving the ship to test out a rowboat, claims he drowned, and has his minions steal the map during Arrow's memorial service. Jim, Gonzo, and Rizzo discover Silver's treachery and inform Smollett. Arriving at Treasure Island, Smollett orders the entire crew save the officers to go ashore, planning to keep himself and non-pirate crew aboard the ship and abandon the pirates on the island. However, his plan falls through when it is discovered that Silver has kidnapped Jim to have leverage against the captain. On the island, Silver invites Jim to join them in the treasure hunt using his late father's compass. When Jim refuses, Silver forcibly takes the compass from him. Smollett, Gonzo, and Rizzo land on the island in an effort to rescue Jim. However, unbeknownst to them, Silver had hidden a squad of pirates aboard the ''Hispaniola'' before leaving, and they capture the ship in Smollett's absence. On the island, Smollett and the rest of the landing party are captured by the native tribe of pigs, where Smollett reunites with his jilted lover [[Ben Gunn (Treasure Island)|Benjamina Gunn]] ([[Miss Piggy]]), the tribe's queen.  The pirates find the cave in which Flint hid the treasure is empty, leading to a brief [[mutiny]] against Silver. Silver reveals that, even though he is a pirate, he cares for Jim and allows him to escape. Smollett and Benjamina are captured by Silver, and Smollett is hung from a cliff to fall to his death. In an effort to save Smollett, Benjamina reveals the treasure is hidden in her house, but when she spits out a kiss from Silver, he hangs her off the cliff as well. Jim rescues his friends and with Mr. Arrow (who is revealed to be alive), the group regains control of the ''Hispaniola'', and rescue Smollett and Benjamina. The group engages the pirates in a sword fight until only Silver is left standing, but he surrenders when he finds himself outnumbered. While the pirates are imprisoned, Silver discovers he still has Mr. Arrow's keys and tries to escape with the treasure. Jim confronts him, but allows him to leave as long as they never cross paths again, much to Silver's disappointment. Silver rows away, but not before returning Jim's compass to him. However, Mr. Arrow informs Jim and Smollett that the boat Silver used was not seaworthy, and Silver is stranded on the island with no gold.  With Jim promoted as the ship's new captain, the crew of the ''Hispaniola'' sails away into the sunset, while some scuba-diving rats recover the treasure from the sea, ending the film.

Four years later, Douglas wins a landslide victory over the now-incumbent Kramer.  Another four years later, Kramer's former Vice President, William Haney ([[Dan Aykroyd]]), defeats Douglas. His Vice President, Ted Matthews ([[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]]), is widely seen as an idiot, and becomes a continuing embarrassment for the administration. A further three years later, Kramer is spending his time writing books and speaking at various inconsequential functions, while Douglas is finishing his own book and going through a divorce.  Meanwhile, the Democratic Party learns about "Olympia", codename for a series of bribes from [[defense contractor]] Charlie Reynolds ([[James Rebhorn]]) paid to Haney when he was Vice President. The [[Democratic National Committee]] chairman Joe Hollis ([[Wilford Brimley]]) asks Douglas to investigate. Hollis offers the support of the Democratic Party for a Presidential run in return for his help. Douglas accepts, hoping to beat Haney and get back into the Oval Office. Meanwhile, Haney and his [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] Carl Witnaur ([[Bradley Whitford]]) plot to frame Kramer for the scandal. When rumors begin to suggest that Kramer was involved in Olympia, he begins his own investigation.  [[National Security Agency|NSA]] agent Colonel Paul Tanner ([[Everett McGill]]) has Reynolds assassinated when he attempts to tell Douglas the truth about Olympia. Kramer arrives at the scene to find Douglas with Reynolds' body. Before they can flee, Douglas and Kramer are forced to board Marine One by White House officials, claiming to be taking them to [[Camp David]] at the request of Haney. During the flight Douglas realizes that they are heading in the wrong direction. Suspicious, they force the pilots to land. They disembark just before the helicopter explodes.  Kramer and Douglas are left stranded, with the realization that the explosion was meant to kill them. They decide to go to Kramer's [[Presidential library|Presidential Library]] in [[Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio]] to obtain records the overly-frugal Kramer kept of all meals served during his time in the White House, which will prove Haney was present at a key meeting with Reynolds. During a series of misadventures, they meet a variety of ordinary Americans and see the effects their terms in office have had. After several close encounters with NSA agents, they arrive at the library and discover the evidence has been tampered with to implicate Kramer. A guard gives Kramer a message from Reynolds' secretary stating that Witnaur had recently met with Reynolds. Douglas and Kramer kidnap Witnaur and with Joe Hollis's help, force him to reveal the plot to frame Kramer, though Witnaur claims to have no knowledge of the attempts on their lives, blaming Tanner and Haney. They at first decide to report Witnaur's confession to Kay Griffin ([[Sela Ward]]), a [[Fox News]] journalist, but Douglas, based upon their adventures, convinces Kramer go to the White House to confront Haney, seeing it as a chance of redemption for their poor choices as Presidents.  They manage to sneak into the White House with the help of the [[White House Executive Chef]] Rita ([[Esther Rolle]]) and make it to the [[Oval Office]] only to discover that Haney is giving a press conference outside. Tanner traps Douglas and Kramer in a guest room but they utilize a secret tunnel to escape while the NSA gives chase. Tanner catches up with them and is about to shoot them when he himself is killed by [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] Sniper Lieutenant Ralph Fleming ([[Jeff Yagher]]), who has recognized the presidents from a chance encounter at a gay pride parade during their adventure, and disobeys orders to shoot them.  Douglas and Kramer interrupt Haney's speech and take him to the Oval Office to talk. There they play Haney a tape of Witnaur's confession, but Haney denies knowledge of Reynolds' murder or the helicopter explosion. Haney agrees to resign and proceeds to give a resignation speech, claiming to have heart problems. Douglas and Kramer muse that the idiotic Matthews will now be elevated from Vice President to President and realize that the only way it could have happened was under these circumstances.  The pair confront Matthews who admits that he, not Haney, had engineered the entire plot so that he could become President, knowing Haney would take the fall. Matthews explains that his stupidity was just an act, but Douglas secretly records his confession on tape. Matthews is sent to prison.  Nine months later, Douglas and Kramer are running together as [[Independent politician|independents]] in the Presidential election, arguing which of them will be the nominee for president. Douglas distracts Kramer by throwing a dollar on the floor, and takes to the podium to announce himself as the Presidential candidate, much to the chagrin of Kramer.

Napoleon (1995 film)
 In [[Sydney, Australia]], a puppy named Muffin is living with a human family and his own mother. Muffin, calling himself Napoleon and pretending to be tough, wishes that he could live with the wild dogs that he can hear howling in the distance. The family has a birthday party and one of the decorations is a basket with balloons strapped to it. Out of curiosity, Napoleon hops inside, but the basket, untied from its tether, begins to float away.  Napoleon flies high above the city and heads out to the sea. A [[galah]] named Birdo drops down on the side of his basket and offers to help him get down. Birdo's idea of help is to pop the balloons suspending the basket, causing Napoleon to land unharmed on a beachhead. Napoleon thinks he can finally seek out the wild dogs and heads into a nearby forest, ignoring Birdo's suggestion to return home.  At night, Napoleon starts to fear being alone. A [[tawny frogmouth|mopoke]] in the forest warns Napoleon of terrible things that can happen to pets in the wild, but Napoleon ignores him as well and continues on his way. He discovers a large tree used by a psychotic cat as a home. The cat spots Napoleon and, thinking he is a mouse, chases him. Napoleon escapes when the mopoke pushes the cat into a pond. The mopoke then warns Napoleon that the cat will not rest until he is dead. As Napoleon runs off, the cat pulls herself from the pond angrily swearing revenge.  The next morning, Napoleon once again encounters Birdo, who decides to teach Napoleon how to live in the wild.  Napoleon learns about hunting by practising on a group of rabbits, but fails to catch one and ends up  eating moss instead. Birdo's next lessons about friendly and dangerous animals and snowy weather are ignored. A sudden brush fire burns a [[sugarcane]] field, but Napoleon escapes with Birdo's help. The cat returns and attempts to attack Birdo, but fails. Birdo reunites with his lost flock but the cat has found them too; Napoleon saves them with a warning of the cat. Napoleon and Birdo then part ways as Napoleon wants to seek the wild dogs and Birdo wants to rejoin his flock.  Napoleon is saddened when he realizes that the howling he has been hearing was just a [[perentie]] lizard. As the area begins to flood, he runs for shelter and discovers two [[dingo]] puppies inside a damp cave and assumes they are lost like him. The water floods in and sweeps away Nancy, one of the pups. Napoleon dives into the water and rescues her out. The pups' mother returns and Napoleon realises that he has found the wild dogs.  The mother agrees to let Napoleon live with her and her pups. While out together, the mother asks why Napoleon wanted to be with the wild dogs. He explains that he always wanted to feel brave by living in the wild, but confesses to being disappointed with the lifestyle. The mother comforts him by reminding him it was his courage that led him out here and helped him save her puppies, which represents the true spirit of the wild dogs. Wanting to go home, Napoleon takes a trip across the landscape in a kangaroo's pouch. Napoleon reaches the shore and discovers that his basket is inhabited by a feisty penguin who resembles his past self, wanting to be a wild and brave creature. That night, Napoleon's plan to sail back to the city with the basket is interrupted by the cat's return. A battle ensues and Napoleon tries multiple times to stop the cat. Before she can kill Napoleon, the cat becomes distracted by the penguin, who shouts at her with taunts. Napoleon then knocks the cat off the cliff and into the basket, which sails away in the water. On a cliff side, Napoleon sees an image of a wild dog howling, symbolising that he understands his bravery of being a wild dog inside.  Birdo reappears with a sea turtle who takes Napoleon back to the city. Napoleon returns home to his mother, who consents to calling him Napoleon instead of Muffin.

Nightjohn (film)
 Sarny, a girl, is born in a slave cabin. Her master Clel Waller is angry, saying that a boy would've been worth more.However, he doesn't sell her, as a promise has been made, so her mother is sold after a few years instead. Sarny is taken care by Delie, another slave.  When Sarny grows to about pre-teenage years, she starts working at the Big House, taking care of Homer, the master's son who is not potty-trained yet. Back at the cabins, Outlaw tries to get Delie to convince Mr. Waller to give him a pass so he can marry a girl named Egypt from another plantation. Delie is preparing a dress for Sarny so she can go to work at the master's house.   After a Sunday church service in which slaves and masters attend, the Wallers have guests over for lunch, among them a doctor who later has a romance with Callie, Clel’s wife who, during the luncheon, talks about Outlaw wanting to court Egypt, owned by Clel's brother. Clel shuts her down stating that if they were to have a baby, it would give money to the wife’s plantation instead of his. Callie asks why things cannot just be about love. Upset about Clel's decision, Sarny accidentally drops the plate of food, and is punished when Clel forces Callie to slap the girl. That night Delie tells Sarny to behave, otherwise she will have to do the hard labor out in the fields. Sarny is upset, vowing revenge on the Wallers.   The next day, Callie tells Sarny to take a letter to the doctor’s place. On the way, she sees a slave trader, Tom, herding black slaves toward the Waller household. At the doctor’s house, the doctor asks Sarny to take a love letter to Callie, keeping it a secret from Clel. He then gives Sarny a penny for her troubles. Back at the plantation, Tom is willing to sell a slave to Clel for 500 dollars. Clel then questions Tom about why he is willing to sell a slave worth $3000 for only $500. Clel then asks the slave to take off his shirt, revealing many scars from being whipped. Clel says that instead, he will buy the man,John, off of Tom for only 50 dollars without clothes.   That night, John and Sarny strike a deal, willing to trade tobacco for lessons on reading. John tells Sarny about the risks, but Sarny accepts as she wants to be free. Sarny learns the letter ‘A’. She then starts to read the letter ‘A’ in the letters between the doctor and Callie that she delivers.  The next morning, Outlaw is being punished because he snuck out the previous night to see Egypt. As Mr. Waller is about to whip Outlaw, Jeffrey, Clel’s son, asks him to stop because they are friends. Clel say to Jeffrey that the slaves were made to pick his cotton instead of being his friend, and Outlaw is whipped. In Sarny's narration of the story, she states that Clel watched everyone instead of the one person he needed to watch, the mistress, his wife.   That night when the Wallers are having a party, Delie walks in on John teaching Sarny the alphabet and is outraged. She questions John about the scars on his back, and he says that they were because he had tried to run away twice. The third time, however, he successfully got away to the North but ended up coming back in order to teach slaves how to read. Delie prohibits John from teaching Sarny to read for her safety. Sarny stalks away, stating that she will teach herself to read. John agrees but says that Delie is teaching Sarny something worse: to be afraid.  Sarny later comes up with a plan for Callie to visit the Doctor secretly, offering to potty-train Homer and swipes his alphabet blocks. This angers a slave, Old Man who had had a finger chopped off after he had learned to read. John shouts out that words are freedom, that the white folks keep words to themselves and that if the slaves had words, they would be free.  Later that night, John writes Sarny’s name in the dirt saying that the letters meant herself.  The next day, Clel recruits everyone in his family to help with picking cotton from the fields, promising a feast to everyone if they are successful with the crop.Later that day when John lovingly teaches Sarny numbers, Delie agrees to learn as well. Sarny reads the bible and is baptized.   It is revealed Sarny had stolen a bible that Jeffrey, the master's other son was supposed to take care of which gets him in trouble from his father. She discovers that she had been lied to and that God was on the slave’s side. As Sarny begins to read more and more, the rest of the slaves reject it and tell her to stop. She begins to read a story in the Gazette newspaper about a slave insurrection (Nat Turner's and his army of slaves), capturing the other slaves’ attention. Sarny then tricks Homer into playing hide and seek so she can go back and read Clel's record book. The Waller plantation had a good crop of cotton this year and as promised, Clel throws a feast. The slaves use this opportunity to let Outlaw and Egypt get married.  It is discovered later that Egypt is pregnant and is forced to run away. John forges Clel’s signature for Outlaw and his wife so they can escape. Jeffrey discovers the stolen bible, and Delie takes the blame. Clel tries to figure out who had taken the bible because he knows that Delie did not know how to read. With no one confessing, Jeffrey whips Delie once. As he tries to continue, he is stopped by John who says that he was the one who took it. This results in Clel chopping off John’s fingers as punishment. When asked if he had learned his lesson, John writes letters in the dirt. Jeffrey tells the overseer to take John to be sold before his father can shoot him.  As he is leaving, John tells Sarny "when you lose one hand, the other gets stronger", meaning that she must forge the other note and teach other slaves how to read. John had written his name in the dirt. Sarny is then seen forging the second note for Outlaw and telling them to name their baby John if it was a boy.  The next morning, Sarny tells the doctor she can no longer keep his secret. Clel interrupts the service saying that he has found two notes written and signed with his name in two different handwritings, meaning that another slave knows to write and threatens to shoot all of them. Sarny objects, saying that Clel would not shoot them because they are his only wealth, something which John was not. She tells Clel that she is worth the most to him because of what she knows. Callie, fearing this, ask Clel to just shoot her. The doctor intervenes, lying that he taught Egypt how to read simple things. Thinking everything has been solved, Sarny is finally sold, and as she narrates, she explains that the story is about her and Nightjohn and that there is a bit of John in all of the slaves.  
North Star (1996 film)
  At the beginning of the [[Nome Gold Rush]] in 1899, Sean McLennon (Caan), a [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]]-[[United States|American]] [[land baron]], owns the majority of  property titles surrounding [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] and declares that only American citizens are legally entitled to [[Gold placer claim|placer claim]]s. He uses power, influence and  nationalism to make local politics and law enforcement work in his favor. Unbeknownst to those outside of McLennon's gang, the original owners of the land were all killed on McLennon's orders.  The gang's latest target, Hudson Santeek (Lambert) narrowly escapes the attempt on his life but not before witnessing McLennon's right-hand thug, Reno ([[Burt Young]]) murder Santeek's adoptive father - an elderly [[Athabaskan]] tribal chief - in cold blood. Santeek, who is half white and half American Indian, had "purchased" his surrogate  family's land in a bid to keep miners away.  Santeek returns to Nome to confront McLennon at knifepoint in his bedroom, but Sarah (McCormack) McLennon's young [[Irish immigrants#United States|Irish immigrant]] [[trophy wife]], intervenes at gunpoint; McLennon disarms Santeek and the two engage in a fight. After Santeek floors McLennon, he kidnaps Sarah, steals a dogsled and rides off into the Alaskan wilderness. Without the permission of the local sheriff, McLennon forms a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] and treks out into the tundra to kill Santeek and rescue his wife.  On the course of the journey, Santeek talks to his captive about her husband's murderous property deed scams, but she does not immediately believe him and  re-avows her loyalty to her husband. However, when McLennon and his men locate Santeek's cabin hideout and shoot at it indiscriminately, Sarah pleas for her husband not  to kill her abductor. McLennon notices that she is wearing a shirt made of animal skin that Santeek had given to her earlier to keep her warm. He erroneously assumes that she betrayed him and had an affair with Santeek. Calling her a "whore," he disowns her and orders his men to  continue firing at Santeek's cabin.  Santeek escapes while his pet wolf fatally lunges at the throat of one of the posse gunmen. Santeek's wolf then attacks the gang's sled dogs, but Reno shoots and kills the animal. With no clear objective and unfamiliarity with the freezing, unpredictable terrain, members  of McLennon's posse begin to turn on one another, but McLennon kills the burnouts in his gang and sets out to finish the job he started.  Meanwhile, back in Nome, Col. Henry Johnson ([[Jacques Francois]]) and the [[U.S. Marshals]] begin their own investigation of McLennon's land seizures, noticing that all of the original [[trustee]]s are  mysteriously deceased and that Santeek (the most recent [[Disseisor|disseisee]]) was witnessed in town alive. On the basis of this discrepancy, the federals declare [[Martial Law]] on Nome and accompany the town's top lawman, Sheriff Lamont ([[Nicholas Hope]]) to bring McLennon and Santeek back for questioning. The enforcers locate McLennon and his gang, but McLennon refuses to obey their orders and the posse shoot Lamont and the other officials to death.  McLennon and the surviving members of his gang eventually track and corner Santeek in a [[glacier cave]]. While Santeek scuffles with Reno, McLennon tips over a wood totem and Reno and Santeek slide down and fall through the sheath of a frozen lake. Reno drowns during the struggle, while Santeek, with his naturalist survival skills, makes it out of the icy water alive.  Once again thinking that Santeek is dead, McLennon returns to Nome alone and conducts another [[Town hall meeting|town speech]], reaffirming his mining policies to the chagrin of immigrant prospectors and the delight of his cronies. However, Johnson and the U.S. Marshals interrupt the huddle and arrest McLennon for the murder of sheriff Lamont and the other constables. Sarah, McLennon's disillusioned wife, had witnessed the massacre and ultimately informed on him.  Soon after, Santeek returns to town to settle scores with the incarcerated McLennon, but finds the former had escaped from his cell and slit the throats of the jailguards in the process. McLennon breaks into his loft apartment (above the saloon which he had owned) and attempts to kill Sarah for turning on him, but Santeek appears behind McLennon and plunges a dagger into his back.

The Nutty Professor (1996 film)
  At Wellman College, thousands of [[hamster]]s overrun the campus after being accidentally released by Sherman Klump, an obese, loving, and kind-hearted professor. Meanwhile, Sherman has created an experimental formula that reconstructs the DNA of an obese person in a way that allows them to lose weight more easily.  After his lecture, Sherman meets and instantly falls in love with Carla Purty, a chemistry graduate who is a big fan of his work. After dinner with his impolite family, Sherman asks Carla out on a date, which she accepts, much to Sherman's surprise. The date begins well with Carla showing admiration for Sherman's work, but the club's obnoxious guest comedian, Reggie Warrington, publicly mocks him about his weight. Sherman becomes depressed and has a nightmare in which he's a patient in an emergency hospital where a virus mutates him into a rampaging giant and wrecks the city with a single fart that is ignited to cause an explosion. He tests his serum on himself and loses 250 pounds within seconds. Overwhelmed by his immediate weight loss, he goes out and buys copious amounts of normal-sized clothing to celebrate, and a $47,000 [[Dodge Viper]] RT/10 sports car on his faculty expense account. However, Sherman discovers that the effects of the serum are only temporary.  Concealing his true identity, Sherman adopts a false identity, "Buddy Love", and invites Carla out on a date at the same club again. Reggie is present again, and Buddy takes revenge by heckling him mercilessly. Sherman's "Buddy" persona starts to develop an independent personality due to the heightened testosterone levels of the transformation, gradually changing from his regular good-natured self to perverted and super-confident. Klump's assistant Jason spots Buddy fleeing the scene after he is identified as the person who left Klump's credit card at the bar. Jason follows Buddy and witnesses his transformation back into Sherman Klump.  The next morning, Dean Richmond has set up a meeting with Sherman and wealthy businessman Harlan Hartley at The Ritz to explain the serum in the hopes of gaining Hartley's $10,000,000 donation to the science department. However, Sherman arrives at The Ritz as Buddy with Carla. When Richmond spots him, Carla asks Buddy if he will take Sherman's place; he does, taking all the credit of Sherman's work. Hartley and Richmond are very impressed, and Richmond invites him to the Alumni Ball the next night. Meanwhile, Buddy picks up three beautiful women, much to Carla's anger, who dumps him and walks out. He invites the women and many other people back to his place for the night to throw a party and has sex with the three women.  Richmond not only fires Sherman, but gleefully tells him that Buddy will be taking his place at the Alumni Ball. Sherman sees a taunting videotape from his alter ego and decides he has had enough of Buddy, taking the decision to destroy all of the serum samples, which he does with Jason's help. Sherman plans to set things right with Carla and get the grant from Hartley. Unfortunately, Buddy planned for this by hiding a sample of the serum in one of Sherman's diet shake cans, which Sherman drinks, causing him to transform into Buddy again. Jason tries to stop him from going to the ball, but Buddy knocks him out with a single blow to the face and departs.  At the ball, Buddy demonstrates the effects of the serum to the audience, but Jason arrives in time, as he has found out that Buddy's testosterone levels are at a lethally high 60,000%. Buddy plans to drink a large sum of the potion to get rid of Sherman for good; Jason knows that if he drinks it, it will kill Sherman and possibly Buddy. The two of them get into a brief fistfight, but Sherman begins to fight Buddy from within. Sherman eventually transforms into his regular self and admits his misdeeds to the shocked audience, including his parents; he says that Buddy was who he thought he and everybody else wanted him to be, and that he should accept himself for who he is. As he leaves, Carla stops him and asks why he lied; he says he did not believe that she would accept him. While they don't initiate a romantic relationship, Sherman and Carla remain friends and share a dance together. Richmond rehires Sherman and Hartley gives the donation to Sherman because he is "a brilliant scientist and a gentleman."  
The Ogre (1996 film)
 Abel Tiffauges ([[John Malkovich|Malkovich]]) is a simple Frenchman at the start of [[World War II]] who loves animals and children. The first part of the film recalls his childhood at a sadistic Catholic school for boys where he prays to [[Saint Christopher]] that the school, which he sees as a prison, be burned down. By chance, while Abel is being disciplined for spilling lamp oil on the chapel floor, his friend Nestor accidentally sets fire to the building, burning it down as he wished. From that day on, Abel is convinced that fate is on his side, and that it will protect him from anything.  It is 1940 as Abel now narrates, and he is working as a car mechanic in Paris. His hobby is photography, and he befriends and photographs the local children. However, on one occasion a girl named Martine takes his camera; he tells her off and upsets her. She then falsely accuses him of assaulting her. The police believe her, and he is put on trial. Fortunately for Abel, a war against [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] has broken out, and soldiers are urgently needed on the front. As a punishment for his supposed crime, he is sent to the army to fight off the invader.  However, it is not long before France surrenders, and Abel and his comrades are sent to a camp in [[East Prussia]]. Abel is often able to sneak away from the camp to a hunting cabin in the forest where he feeds a blind moose. One day, he encounters a German officer  who is curious about his affinity for animals and tells him that the moose is known as The Ogre to the local peasants before telling him to return to the camp and to stop visiting the cabin.  Several weeks later, the officer returns to Abel, and removes him from the camp. He takes him to [[Hermann Göring]]'s hunting lodge where he is the Chief Forester and gives him a job looking after the animals on the estate.  When Göring ([[Volker Spengler|Spengler]]) arrives, he first seems cheerful and friendly, but it is soon clear that he is sadistic, bombastic and mentally unstable. After hearing news that he is needed in Berlin because of the failure of the German Army at Stalingrad on the Russian Front, he dismisses the whole company at the lodge - including Abel. Before leaving, however, the now-former Chief Forester arranges for Abel to be given a new job at the nearby Kaltenborn Castle, a [[National Political Institutes of Education|military academy]] for boys.  At the castle, he instantly proves popular with the boys, and is treated by the staff as a privileged servant. One day, he is out riding, and comes across a group of boys on holiday. He tells them of life in the castle and they follow him back. An SS officer, [[Obersturmbannführer]] Raufeisen, is impressed and gives him the job of recruiting local boys into the academy. Although he is successful and means well in his efforts, Abel soon learns from the castle housekeeper, Mrs. Netta, that the locals are afraid of him for taking the boys, and that they have published pamphlets telling parents to watch out for "The Ogre", his newly-acquired nickname. Abel begins to develop doubts about his work. Several days later, one of the boys he recruited is left horribly burned during training from standing behind another boy as he fires a [[Panzerfaust]], making Abel yet more uncertain of the Nazis. Soon after, the owner of the academy, Count Kaltenborn ([[Armin Mueller-Stahl|Mueller-Stahl]]), is revealed to have been part of a plot to kill [[Hitler]]. He is arrested and taken away in a car, and is never seen again. Meanwhile, news has broken out that the [[Red Army]] has crossed the border, and the officers in charge of the castle, as well as the oldest boys training there, are sent out to the front line.  One night while out riding, Abel finds a column of prisoners being taken through the forest, and sees one being shot by a German soldier. When they have gone he approaches the road and finds that it is littered with dead bodies. Under the pile of corpses, he finds a boy named Ephraim who is barely alive and takes him to the castle where he hides him in the attic. With all the officers dead or at the front, Abel and Frau Netta are now in charge of the castle. Frau Netta stays on, trying to look after the boys, but Abel realizes that Hitler and the Nazis have lied- there will be no victory, and a last stand at the castle would be pointless. Abel gathers the remaining cadets and orders them to prepare to evacuate. Caught up in a patriotic fervor, they deem Abel a traitor and knock him unconscious. Shortly afterward, a group of German veterans arrives. Led by Raufeisen, they take command of Kaltenborn Castle, promising the boys a victorious battle for the Fatherland.  That night, Abel regains consciousness and returns to the attic. The Russians soon arrive, and a senior officer demands the castle's surrender. Abel tries to surrender the castle, but Raufeisen nearly shoots him with a rifle and the boys open fire on the Russians. As the battle begins, Abel finds Ephraim and leaves the castle with him. The castle catches fire during the fighting; it burns down and none of the defenders survive. They escape across the marshes safely, with Abel recalling the tale of [[St. Christopher]], and the scene fades to black.

The children arrive just a moment too late to go on a school field trip (a Circle Line boat cruise). Their parents are forced to accept that, on top of hectically busy schedules, they must work together that day to supervise each other's child. In their confusion of sharing a taxi, they accidentally switch cellphones, causing each of them, all morning, to receive calls intended for the other one, which they then have to relay to the right person.  Melanie must make an architectural design presentation to an important client. Jack has to find a source for a scoop on the New York mayor's mob connections. Sammy causes havoc at Melanie's office with toy cars, causing her to trip and break her scale model display. In frustration, Melanie takes Sammy to a daycare center (which is having a "Superhero Day"), where she coincidentally comes across Jack trying to convince Maggie to stay and behave herself. They create impromptu costumes for the children, utilizing his imagination and her resourcefulness. She takes her model to a shop to get quickly repaired.  Having left for a meeting, Melanie panics when she receives a phone call from Sammy about another child having a psychedelic drug. She phones Jack in desperation and asks him to pick up both kids. He agrees, on the condition that she take over their care at 3:15 while he chases down a potential news source.  While in Melanie's care, Maggie goes missing from a store, and wanders some distance down a crowded midtown sidewalk.

He is notified by the police that Maggie has been found, and makes it to the press conference just barely in time to confront the mayor with his scoop about corruption. He had earlier tracked down its source, just as she was leaving a beauty salon in a limousine. Although they have been antagonistic, Melanie and Jack work together to get both Sammy and Maggie, by taxi, to a soccer game. She insists that she will have time first to do her presentation to the new clients, despite him protesting that it will make them late for the game. She begins her pitch over drinks at the [[21 Club]] lounge, but upon seeing Sammy in high spirits, she realizes that she cares more about him than her job. Bravely insisting that she must leave immediately to be with him, she fully expects to be fired, yet the clients are impressed.  At the game, Melanie meets her former husband, Eddie, who admits that he lied to Sammy and that he will be going on tour as a drummer with [[Bruce Springsteen]]. That evening, Jack wants a reason to visit Melanie's apartment, so he takes Maggie to buy goldfish to replace the ones that were eaten earlier in the day by a cat.  At Melanie's apartment, the children watch TV while she and Jack share a first kiss. She goes to the bathroom to freshen up; when she returns, an exhausted Jack is asleep on the sofa. She joins him and they fall asleep together, with the children happily observing.

Once Upon a Time...When We Were Colored
 The film takes place in [[Glen Allan, Mississippi]], during the mid-1900s. In the early stages of the film, the audience gains more knowledge regarding Cliff’s upbringing. His biological mother was too young to take care of him and was not able to provide Cliff with financial support therefore he was raised by his extended family. Ma Pearl and Poppa begin to take care of him but after a couple of years, Ma Ponk begins to take care of Cliff and ultimately raises him, with the help of Poppa. Ma Pearl’s character is played by [[Paula Kelly (actress)|Paula Kelly]], and Ma Ponk’s character is played by [[Phylicia Rashad]].  Poppa’s character is played by [[Al Freeman, Jr.]]; Ma Ponk, Poppa, and Cliff are the three main characters in the film. Another scene that occurs early on in the film which helps to portray the racial climate during the 1950s in the South, is when Cliff and Poppa attend a parade hosted by the Ku Klux Klan and are confronted for being African Americans by a violent Ku Klux Klan member. As the film progresses, it is known that Cliff lives in a low-income, rural place where almost every adult is a laborer, most commonly a field worker. This is known when the narrator mentions that Cliff attends school in a single bungalow where his classmates are the children of servants, illiterate farm workers, poor field workers, and maids. Even his caregiver, Ma Ponk works in a cotton field picking cotton for a white farmer.  Also, the majority of the people living in this small town are part of a Christian church where at times they come together and unite to stay strong against the social injustices placed upon them. Ma Ponk is religious and is an active participant in her local Christian church since she attends mass regularly and is part of the church’s gospel choir. As the film progresses even more, the audience has the chance to see Cliff grow up into a hard-working young man with positive aspirations of becoming educated. Cliff begins working for an older white woman, Ms. Mavory, who begins to show an interest in educating and enlightening Cliff. She asks him if he likes to read and he says yes therefore she then begins to make trips to the local library and checks out books for Cliff to read.  One book that she checks out for Cliff is [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. Cliff reads it and mentions to Cleve that he actually enjoys reading the book. The fact that Cliff enjoys reading great classics and strives to excel in school shows that he does want to make a positive change in society. He does not make a radical change but instead makes a subtle positive change by choosing to work hard and continue his education. When Cliff grows older and finishes his high school education, he leaves his hometown to migrate North. He leaves the South in hope of finding a better life and reaching his dreams.  
Original Gangstas
  The movie opens to a narration detailing the poor economic state of a gang-ridden Gary. The narrator explains to the audience of how the city came into such a state. After the opening narrative, the scene switches to the base of operations for the ''Rebels'', a local street gang, and a one-on-one basketball game between a Rebel gang member and a local boy named Kenny Thompson. Kenny humiliates the Rebel by winning and taking the gambled winnings for his own. After he leaves, Spyro, the current co-leader of the Rebels (opposite Damien) is under the impression that Kenny's skills are something more than "something he picked up." He instructs his lieutenant, Kayo, to exact retribution on Kenny for being hustled.  While Kenny and his friend Marcus are relaxing at a diner, Kenny decides to call his girlfriend. He enters a phone booth to make the call, but is subsequently shot by Kayo in a drive-by shooting; his mother, Laurie Thompson, alarmed by the gunshots, steps outside her home to discover her son murdered. The owners of the grocery store, Marvin Bookman and Gracie Bookman, two well-respected members of the community by both the Rebels and local citizens, feels that justice should be brought to Kenny's murderer and discloses the license plate number of the shooter's vehicle. When the Rebels discover this, Spyro orders Kayo to dispose of the vehicle. Kayo and the Rebels then proceed to confront Marvin about his assistance to the investigators of Kenny's death; Marvin argues that Kenny was a good person and did not deserve to be shot. The co-leaders of the Rebels describe how they respected the Bookmans' store and, while others around it were robbed and ransacked, their store was left alone; the fact that Marvin would "sell them out" expresses a high amount of disrespect to the Rebels, who then immediately seek revenge on Marvin. Eventually, Kayo and Bobby, with a group of fellow Rebels, attacks the grocery store, resulting in the near-fatal shooting of Marvin by Bobby.  The attack on Marvin's life prompts his son, pro football coach and ex-Rebel John Bookman, to return to the impoverished Gary neighborhood to find Bobby the shooter. After seeing his father, John goes to save his father's shop and kicked all the Rebels fellows out of there. Then he goes to a local barbershop, where Kayo eventually turns up; trouble immediately brews, and John and the gang members fight. John has the upper hand, but is overpowered. Jake Trevor, another original Rebel, enters the fray and saves John. After the fight, the two converse, and it is revealed that Jake is here to bury his illegitimate son, Kenny Thompson. Jake goes to visit "Slick",who reveals to Jake that his son was killed because he hustled the Rebels; Jake is astounded and enraged that his son was killed over money.  The next day, John and Jake attend Kenny's funeral, where a distraught Laurie Thompson is reunited with her ex-husband. While talking, Laurie implores Jake to reconsider seeking vengeance upon his son's murderers, expressing her disdain by stating that he always wishes to resolve such issues by fighting, which "only makes things worse". John tells Jake that he has a meeting with the Rebels at the church that makes Jake and Laurie disappointed at him. Jake confronts Spyro at the basketball court about Kenny Thompson.  After failed treaty negotiations at the church and the rising of neighborhood gang violence, the other gangs, The Diablos and The Rangers, have a meeting with Spyro, Damien and The Rebels about Kenny Thompson. At the Rebels party, John and Jake drove Spyro and Damien's car into The Diablo's territory and shoot at them to set The Rebels up to break the truce. The Rebels set the community houses on fire as retaliation with molotov cocktails. All of the original Rebels - John Bookman, Laurie, Jake, Slick and Bubba - with the help of Kenny's friend Marcus, decide to take justice into their own hands and attack the Rebels. They devise a plan to "lose" a trunk of weapons to the Rebels; when the Rebels tried to use said weapons, the guns malfunctioned and "exploded" in their faces, stunning many Rebels. In another area, Rebels are attempting to escape the battle, but are stopped by a group of community members, armed with bats and other improvised weapons. Eventually, Spyro and Damien fear they may lose the fight, and escape to the old steel mill; Jake and John follow.  After an intense hand-to-hand fight between Jake and Spyro, Spyro is killed. After Spyro is taken down by Jake, the leader of a rival gang The Diablos, Blood, along with a few cohorts, shoots a battered Damien; the leadership of the Rebels is destroyed.

Tom does not remember his friend, but out of sympathy attends the funeral as a [[pallbearer]]. While Ruth struggles with her loss and Tom with his supposedly failed memory, the two develop a romance. Meanwhile, Tom's unrequited high school crush, Julie DeMarco ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]), re-enters his life.  At Abernathy's funeral, Tom's vague and impersonal eulogy confuses the Abernathy family and amuses Tom's friends. Julie, upset at their lack of respect, tries to leave as the pallbearers carry Bill's coffin out of the church. Tom, one of the pallbearers, drags the coffin and the rest of the pallbearers after Julie. He asks her if she knew Bill; she replies that she did not know Bill, but was saddened by the image of Bill in the coffin. Tom asks Julie out for coffee still holding up Bill's coffin. Bill's relatives, upset about Tom's indifference towards Bill, forcefully relieve him of his duty as a pallbearer. Visibly upset, Ruth states that Tom is in Bill's will.  Afterwards, Tom calls Julie about the coffee date and Julie asks if Scott and Cynthia can come along for a double date. During dinner with Scott and Cynthia, it is apparent that Julie and Scott have more in common and listen to the same musicians. Conversation between Tom and Julie is stilted and awkward, while Scott slips up and reveals that Tom still lives with his mother.  Disgusted by Scott's behavior during dinner, Tom reluctantly follows through with the plan to drive Julie home. When they reach Julie's home, Julie reveals that she remembered Tom in high school.

Jumping into the driver's seat, Tom drives by and stops to see Scott lean in to kiss Julie. When Scott sees Tom, Tom drives off.  The next morning, Julie comes to talk to Tom about Scott's attempt of infidelity, not knowing Tom had witnessed the entire event.  Reminiscing about high school band, Julie tells Tom that she wants to just drive away for a year just to be on her own. Julie invites Tom to a concert she had planned on going with her former fiancé, Jed.  When arriving at Ruth's, Tom is rushed to a family gathering of Abernathy's. At Aunt Lucille's, Tom sees that Ruth had overheard him talking to Julie about their date later that evening. When Tom's car breaks down, Julie finds Ruth's charm bracelet, so Tom tells her that he has been helping Bill Abernathy's mother since the funeral. Julie mistakenly assumes an innocent relationship between Tom and Ruth.  After a tow truck takes Tom and Julie back to Tom's house, Tom sneaks into his mother's room to get her car keys, while Julie enters Tom's room. Tom reveals he wanted to dance with her at a homecoming dance and she kisses him. As they fall into Tom's bed, Ruth calls Tom finding out that Julie is in the room with him.  When Tom goes to see Brad for advice, he tells Tom to drop the bracelet with a letter into a mailbox for a clean break with Ruth. Tom does as Brad tells him and proceeds to continue dating Julie. For Julie's birthday, Julie asks Tom to go with her to meet her parents. On that morning, Tom sees Ruth carrying the envelope with her bracelet and Tom's letter, so Tom sneaks away through the back door. At brunch with Julie's parents, it is immediately apparent that her father disapproves of Tom and Julie's relationship when he keeps asking why he is there with them. After Tom pleads with Julie to abandon her plans to leave for a year, Ruth barges into the restaurant and humiliates Tom by revealing their past relationship.  At Brad's bachelor party, Tom makes a scene at the strip club telling Brad not to marry Lauren. Tom says Lauren is an albatross around his neck and Scott thinks so as well. The next day, Scott apologizes to Tom and they reconcile. While talking about past crushes growing up, they both realize that there was another Tom who moved away after junior high school. Tom brings the other Tom to Ruth, who appreciates the gesture to reminisce about her son. They come to an understanding about needing someone at the time, Ruth mourning her son and Tom being rejected by his childhood crush, Julie.  At Brad's wedding, Tom patches his friendship with Brad approving of his marriage to Lauren, as Scott and Cynthia appear to talk civilly together hinting of reconciliation. During the reception, Tom sees Julie and gives her the keys to his car as a belated birthday present for her trip. She hints to him from a previous conversation that she wants to dance.  Tom gets a new job and moves into Julie's apartment while she is on her trip.

The People vs. Larry Flynt
 In 1952, 10-year-old [[Larry Flynt]] is selling [[moonshine]] in [[Kentucky]]. Twenty years later, Flynt and his younger brother, Jimmy, run the Hustler Go-Go club in [[Cincinnati]]. With profits down, Flynt decides to publish a newsletter for the club, the first ''[[Hustler]]'' magazine, with nude pictures of women working at the club. The newsletter soon becomes a full-fledged magazine, but sales are weak. After ''Hustler'' publishes nude pictures of former first lady [[Jackie Kennedy Onassis]], sales take off.  Flynt becomes smitten with [[Althea Flynt|Althea Leasure]], a stripper who works at one of his clubs. With Althea and Jimmy's help, Flynt makes a fortune from sales of ''Hustler''. With his success comes enemies - as he finds himself a hated figure of [[anti-pornography]] activists. He argues with the activists, saying that "murder is illegal, but if you take a picture of it, you may get your name in a magazine or maybe win a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. However, sex is legal, but if you take a picture of that act, you can go to jail." He becomes involved in several prominent court cases, and befriends a young lawyer, [[Alan Isaacman]]. In 1975, Flynt loses a smut-peddling court decision in Cincinnati but is released from jail soon afterwards on a technicality. [[Ruth Carter Stapleton]], a Christian activist and sister of President [[Jimmy Carter]], seeks out Flynt and urges him to give his life to Jesus. Flynt seems moved and starts letting his newfound religion influence everything in his life, including ''Hustler'' content.  In 1978, during another trial in Georgia, Flynt and Isaacman are both shot by a [[Joseph Paul Franklin|man with a rifle]] while they walk outside a courthouse. Isaacman recovers, but Flynt is paralyzed from the waist down and uses a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Wishing he was dead, Flynt renounces God. Because of the emotional and physical pain, he moves to [[Beverly Hills]] and spirals down into depression and drug use. During this time, Althea also becomes addicted to painkillers and morphine.  In 1983, Flynt undergoes surgery to deaden several nerves in his back damaged by the bullet wounds, and as a result, feels rejuvenated. He returns to an active role with the publication, which, in his absence, had been run by Althea and Jimmy. Flynt is soon in court again for leaking videos relating to the [[John DeLorean]] entrapment case, and during his courtroom antics, he fires Isaacman, then throws an orange at the judge. He later wears an American flag as an adult diaper along with an army helmet, and wears T-shirts with provocative messages such as "I Wish I Was Black" and "Fuck This Court." After spitting water at the judge Flynt is sent to a [[psychiatric ward]], where he sinks into depression again. Flynt publishes a satirical parody ad in which [[Jerry Falwell]] tells of a sexual encounter with his mother. Falwell sues for [[libel]] and emotional distress. Flynt countersues for [[copyright infringement]], because Falwell copied his ad. The case goes to trial in December 1984, but the decision is mixed, as Flynt is found guilty of inflicting emotional distress but not libel. By that time, Althea has contracted [[HIV]], which proceeds to [[AIDS]]. Some time later in 1987, Flynt finds her dead in the bathtub, having drowned.  Flynt presses Isaacman to appeal the Falwell decision to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Isaacman refuses, saying Flynt's courtroom antics humiliated him. Flynt pleads with him, saying that he "wants to be remembered for something meaningful". Isaacman agrees and argues the "emotional distress" decision in front of the Supreme Court, in the case ''[[Hustler Magazine v. Falwell]]'' in 1988. With Flynt sitting silently in the courtroom, the court overturns the original verdict in a unanimous decision. After the trial, Flynt is alone in his bedroom watching old videotapes of a healthy Althea.  
The Phantom (1996 film)
  In the early [[16th century]], a young boy helplessly witnesses his father's death at the hands of Kabai Sengh, the ruthless leader of the Sengh brotherhood who attacked their ship. The boy jumps overboard and is washed ashore on an island called Bengalla where he is found by tribesmen who take him to their village. There he is given the Skull Ring and swears to devote his life to the destruction of piracy, greed, cruelty and injustice. In adulthood, he adopts the identity of "The Phantom", a masked avenger. The role of The Phantom is passed on from father to son through centuries, leading people to believe in a single, immortal figure and accordingly nickname him "The Ghost Who Walks" and "The Man Who Never Dies".  In 1938, Kit Walker, the 21st Phantom, finds a man named Quill leading a mercenary group in the jungle. The group is searching for one of the Skulls of Touganda, which grants its owner a tremendous destructive power. The Phantom saves the native boy they had kidnapped to be their guide and captures Quill's men, leaving them to be picked up by the jungle patrol while their leader escapes. Quill — revealed as a member of the Sengh Brotherhood, and the man who killed Kit's father — flees with the Skull and returns to the United States.  In New York City, Kit's ex-girlfriend from college, Diana Palmer, is a frequent traveler whose uncle, Dave Palmer, is the famous owner of the "World Tribune" newspaper. The paper has been investigating power-hungry business man Xander Drax, a shady character with a reputation for having dealings with criminals. Mr. Palmer has managed to uncover that Drax is connected to a mysterious spider web symbol, which he traces back to the Bengalla Jungle. He sends Diana to investigate, and en route, her airplane is hijacked by female [[air pirate]]s employed by Drax and led by the [[femme fatale]] Sala. Diana is abducted and taken to their base on the waterfront in Bengalla. Having been informed of Diana's abduction by the Jungle Patrol's captain Phillip Horton, the Phantom rescues Diana and escapes from Quill and his men to his headquarters, the Skull Cave (with the help of his white horse Hero, his pet wolf Devil, and his jungle friends the Rope People). There, Diana meets with Horton, where she is informed by the Phantom and Horton that she is involved with the Sengh Brotherhood. The Phantom tells Horton to use the Jungle Patrol to take care of Diana and return her to New York while he goes after the Brotherhood.   Back in New York, Kit, now dressed as his civilian self, meets with Mr. Palmer at the Tribune building and once again meets with Diana, who has mixed feelings about him since his sudden disappearance several years before. Diana's would-be suitor Jimmy Wells mentions he had seen one of the skulls in the [[Museum of Natural History]]. Kit and Diana hurry there and are captured by Drax and his men, who steal the second Skull from Kit and unite it with the first, revealing the location of the third Skull on an uncharted island known as the Devil's Vortex on the Yellow Sea. Kit sees his father's old skull belt buckled around Quill's waist and realizes that he is his father's killer. He manages to escape from him and his henchmen and, as the Phantom, evades the police outside the museum (Drax is allied with New York's corrupt police commissioner, who Mr. Palmer had informed of Diana’s trip). Meanwhile, Sala flies Drax, Quill and Diana (Drax's "Phantom insurance" after Sala reveals that Diana is his girlfriend) to the Devil's Vortex, not knowing that the Phantom has managed to hitch a ride on one of the plane's landing pontoons.  On the island, Drax meets with the pirate Kabai Sengh, a descendant of the Brotherhood's original leader, who possesses the third Skull. Sengh warns Drax of the existence of a "Fourth Skull", which controls the power of the other three. The Phantom appears and battles both men, with Kabai Sengh killed by his own pool of sharks, as Diana and Sala cooperate to defeat the other villains. Drax unites the three Skulls and turns them against the Phantom, but instead Quill is hit by the Skulls power, which results in him being disintegrated. The Phantom uses the Fourth Skull — his own ring — to overcome the others and destroy both them and Drax in a powerful explosion. As the island is destroyed, the Phantom narrowly escapes with Diana and Sala.  In Bengalla once again, Diana reveals to the Phantom she has figured out his secret and his double-identity. Kit removes his mask, telling her that he is only allowed to reveal all of his secrets to one person, the woman he intends to marry, but she leaves again for New York. Kit's father laments his son's failure to pursue Diana, but states that she will return to the Phantom's jungle, and to Kit, one day.

When his family goes on vacation, Benny borrows his father's Mercedes and heads on down to the beach with Durrell.At the beach, they meet the "Beastie Boy reject" Mikey Z, a homeboy wannabe, played by actor Gregg Vance (the only white caucasian character in the movie).  They have told themselves that they are there to sell beach-goers cheap sunglasses, but they are really there to show off their 'phat' box and attract the finest girls with portable beats on the beach.Comic encounters with the beach girls and a continuous playful banter between Mickey Z and the Durrel-Benny duo form the mainstay of the movie .

The Pillow Book (film)
  The film's title, "''[[The Pillow Book]]''", refers to an ancient Japanese diary written by [[Sei Shōnagon]], actual name believed to be Kiyohara Nagiko, from whence the protagonist's name in the film.  The film is narrated by Nagiko, a Japanese born model living in Hong Kong. Nagiko seeks a lover who can match her desire for carnal pleasure with her admiration for poetry and calligraphy. The roots of this obsession lie in her youth in [[Kyoto]], when her father would write [[Kanji|characters]] of good fortune on her face. Nagiko's father celebrates her birthday retelling the Japanese creation myth and writing on her flesh in beautiful calligraphy, while her aunt reads a list of "beautiful things" from [[Sei Shōnagon]]'s ''Pillow Book''. Nagiko's aunt tells her that when she is twenty-eight years old, the official book of observations will be officially 1000 years old, and that she, Nagiko, will be the same age as Sei Shōnagon when she had written the book (in addition to sharing her first name). Nagiko also learns around this time that her father is in thrall to his publisher, "Yaji-san", who demands sexual favours from her father in exchange for publishing his work.  ===Early chapters=== The publisher arranges Nagiko's wedding to his young apprentice. Her husband, an expert archer, resents Nagiko's love for books and her desire to read, in spite of his apprenticeship. He also refuses to indulge in her desires for pleasure, refusing to write on her body. When he discovers and reads Nagiko's pillow book, he is extremely resentful, setting it on fire and thus setting fire to their marital home, an event which Nagiko describes to be the 'first major fire of [her] life.' Insulted and enraged, Nagiko leaves him for good.  Hiding from her husband, Nagiko moves to Hong Kong. In spite of her aversion to the practice, she learns how to [[typing|type]] to find work. Outside her apartment, a group of activists regularly protest the publishing industry for the [[deforestation|depletion of forests]] due to the need to make paper.  After working as a secretary in the office of a Japanese fashion designer for a while, Nagiko's employer takes a liking to her and makes her one of his models. As a successful fashion model, Nagiko hires a maid, as she now finally has the opportunity to explore her sexual desires of being written on. However, after several affairs, she feels dissatisfied with them all: either they have great penmanship and are lousy lovers, or vice versa.  One day, at the Cafe Typo, Nagiko's favourite haunt, she meets Jerome, a British translator. Intrigued by his knowledge, they go to a private space where she has Jerome write on her body in various languages. In spite of her interest, Nagiko dislikes Jerome's handwriting and orders him out. Jerome totally shocks Nagiko, however, when he asks her to teach him, offering her to write on ''his'' body. Opening his shirt, he offers Nagiko to "Use my body like the pages of a book. Of ''your'' book!". Nagiko has never considered this aspect in her desires before: her lovers always write on ''her'' body. When she backs out and runs, Jerome laughs at her.  Frightened but very intrigued by Jerome's suggestion, Nagiko has several one-night stands in which she experiments writing on their bodies. One of the activists, admirer Hoki, a Japanese photographer who adores her, begs Nagiko to take him as a lover. She explains she can't, as his skin's no good for writing: whenever she writes on him, the ink smears and runs. Hoki, not wanting Nagiko to keep carrying on like she is, suggests she try writing a book, offering to take it to a renowned publisher he freelances for. Nagiko likes this idea and writes her first book.  Nagiko's book is returned, being told the book is "not worth the paper it's written on!". Insulted, Nagiko follows the address on the envelope to confront the publisher. Nagiko is shocked to discover that the publisher who rejected her work is in fact Yaji-san, her father's old publisher. What's more, the publisher has a young lover: Jerome.  Devising a plan, Nagiko decides that she will get to the publisher through Jerome. Meeting up with Jerome again, Nagiko discovers he has learned a few more languages, and his penmanship has greatly improved. Nagiko and Jerome spend several weeks exploring this, writing on each other and making love. Nagiko soon realises that, in Jerome, she has found the perfect lover she has been searching for: the partner with whom she can share her physical and her poetic passion, using each other's bodies as tablets for their art.  ===Writing of books 1 – 6=== Nagiko tells Jerome the truth and the whole story with the publisher. Jerome comes up with an idea: Nagiko will write her book on Jerome's body and Jerome will take it to the publisher. Nagiko loves the idea, and writes '''Book 1: The Book of The Agenda''', in intricate characters of black, red, and gold, on Jerome, keeping her identity [[Anonymity|anonymous]]. The plan is a success: Jerome sees the publisher and exhibits the book on his nude body, and the impressed publisher has his [[scrivener]]s copy down the text.  After telling Nagiko of the plan's success, Jerome tells Nagiko that he'll return to her as soon as the publisher, who was extremely aroused by the experience, lets him go. However, during his time with the publisher, Jerome appears to lose track of time and doesn't return to Nagiko. Nagiko, jealous, impatient, and angry, searches for Jerome, eventually finding him making love with the publisher. Nagiko takes this as rejection and betrayal of the worst kind, and immediately plots revenge.  On two [[Sweden|Swedish]] tourists, Nagiko writes '''Book 2: The Book of The [[Innocent]]''' and '''Book 3: The Book of the [[Idiot (usage)|Idiot]]'''. Shortly afterwards, an old man is running naked through the streets from the publisher's shop, bearing '''Book 4: The Book of [[Impotence]]/[[Old Age]]'''. '''Book 5: The Book of the [[Exhibitionist]]''' is delivered by a boorish, fat, hyperactive American (Tom Kane; who was actually more interested in Hoki than Nagiko).  Nagiko's revenge is a success. Jerome is furiously jealous, and comes to Nagiko's home to confront her. Nagiko refuses to meet him, however, and won't let Jerome in. Jerome's outrage soon turns to desperation as he begs her to talk to him, but she won't.  Jerome sinks into deep depression and meets with Hoki at the Cafe Typo, desperate to find a way to get Nagiko to forgive him. Hoki suggests that he "scare" Nagiko by faking suicide, similar to the fake death scene in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and gives Jerome some pills.  Arriving at Nagiko's home while she is away, Jerome takes some of the pills, then writes a page, as if writing a book. Each time he takes some pills, he writes another page, keeping track of how many pills he takes on each page. As the pills take effect, Jerome can write no more and lies on the bed, naked, holding a copy of [[Sei Shōnagon]]'s [[the Pillow Book|the book of observations]].  The plan is a success: when Nagiko returns home and finds Jerome, she rushes to him, eager to renew their relationship and continue their plans. However, the plan has worked too well: Jerome has overdosed on the pills and is dead. Nagiko is devastated, and realises how much she loved him. On his dead body, Nagiko writes '''Book 6: The Book of the Lovers'''.  At Jerome's funeral, his mother, a snobbish, upper-class woman, tells Nagiko that Jerome always loved things that were "fashionable". When she suggests that was probably why Jerome loved Nagiko, Nagiko strikes her.  After the funeral, the publisher secretly exhumes Jerome's body from the tomb and has Jerome's skin, still bearing the writing, flayed and made into a grotesque pillow book of his own. Nagiko, now back in Japan, learns of the publisher's actions and becomes distraught and outraged. She sends a letter to the publisher, still keeping her identity a secret, demanding that particular book from the publisher's hands in exchange for the remaining books. The publisher, now obsessed with his mysterious writer and her work, agrees.  ===Writing of books 7 – 13=== Nagiko, now pregnant with Jerome's child, writes '''Book 7: The Book of The [[Seducer]]''' on a male messenger. The writing on him is almost destroyed and undecipherable when the publisher accidentally leaves the messenger out in the rain. '''Book 8: The Book of [[Youth]]''' is delivered as a series of photographs. A young [[Buddhist monk]] then arrives bearing '''Book 9: The Book of [[Secret]]s''' written on all his "secret" spots: in between his fingers and toes, the insides of his thighs, etc.; the book is presented in the form of riddles. When the next messenger arrives, he is completely bare: no writing at all. The publisher and staff search for any hint of writing on the messenger's naked body.  As the publisher dismisses him as a hoax, the man sticks out his tongue, bearing '''Book 10: The Book of [[Silence]]'''.  The activists' protests come to an end when their truck hits a young wrestler bearing '''Book 11: The Book of The [[Betray]]ed''', right outside the publisher's office. The next messenger ([[Masaru Matsuda]]) simply drives by the office, giving little time to copy down '''Book 12: The Book of False Starts'''.  Finally, '''Book 13: The Book of the Dead''' arrives on the body of a [[Sumo]] wrestler. In the book writing on the body of the messenger, which the publisher carefully reads, Nagiko finally reveals her identity, confronting the publisher with his crimes: blackmailing and disgracing her father, "corrupting" her husband, as well as Jerome, and what he's done to Jerome's corpse. The publisher, greatly shamed and humbled by being confronted with his guilt, hands the pillow book made of Jerome's skin to the messenger, then has the messenger slit his throat.          Upon recovering the book made out of Jerome's skin, Nagiko buries it under a [[Bonsai]] tree and life goes on. She has given birth to Jerome's child, and is shown in the epilogue writing on her child's face, like her father used to do when she was young, and quoting from her own pillow book. It is now Nagiko's 28th birthday.  Nagiko's bi-cultural heritage plays a key role in this film. As a half-Chinese and half-Japanese woman, Nagiko navigates her dual cultures through physical and psychological exploration. Greenaway portrays this exploration subtly by mixing and switching Asian iconography.  
Phenomenon (film)
 George Malley is a kind but average auto mechanic in a small town in [[Northern California]]. While celebrating his 37th birthday at a local bar with his best friend, Nate, and father figure, Doc Brunder, he steps outside while drunk. A ball of shining bright white lights moves around in the sky,  grows closer and hits him in the head, making a loud sound and knocking him down. When he comes to and re-enters the bar, he learns that nobody else saw the lights nor did they hear the sound. Doc notices something is amiss when George quickly achieves a checkmate in their chess game.  George begins to exhibit remarkable levels of intelligence. He easily absorbs vast amounts of information, formulates new, revolutionary ideas, as well as developing [[psychokinesis]]. Not needing sleep, he spends each night reading multiple books.  George tries to use his new intelligence [[altruism|for the good of his community]]. He correctly predicts an earthquake without any equipment. When Doc is called to aid a sick Portuguese man, George learns the language in minutes and helps translate. He then uses his telekinesis to rescue the man's young relative. Visiting Nate, George decodes and responds to a signal on Nate's shortwave radio, though Nate asks him to forget about it out of fear that they might be picking up information from a nearby air force base.  During this time of upheaval the townsfolk become wary, but George finds support from Doc, Nate and from a growing relationship with a single mother, Lace, and her children, Al and Glory. George also sets a plan in place to help Nate get together with the mother of the Portuguese boy he rescued.  George invites Lace to join him on a trip to [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] to meet with [[seismologist]] Professor Ringold about George's earthquake prediction. Instead, the FBI takes George and Nate into custody over his code-breaking. He breaks more codes, then astounds Dr. Nierdof by easily answering a series of difficult quizzes and exams. When George threatens to talk to the press, he is finally released.  Returning to the local bar, George becomes frustrated with friends' questions about his abilities, and he causes a large mirror to break via telekinesis. Lace visits him to provide a shave and a haircut. Their innocent intimacy scares her since she has tried so hard to not like him, but it encourages him to stop avoiding the townsfolk. He goes to the county fair to ease fear with a demonstration of his powers, but the crowd goes into a frenzy, demanding his attention and his perceived healing powers. George is knocked to the ground, where he again sees the balls of light, before losing consciousness.  George awakens in a hospital. With Lace and Nate there for support, Doc explains that George has a deadly [[astrocytoma|brain tumor]]. This has caused the lights and stimulated George's phenomenal brain functions. They have called Dr. Wellin, a leading brain surgeon, to see if an operation can save George's life. Dr. Wellin later determines there is only a 1 in 500 chance of survival, but wants to proceed with an invasive operation solely to do research on George's living brain. When George refuses, saying he still has work to do, the doctor has him declared mentally unfit and held against his will.  George escapes from the hospital and returns home. He spends time with Nate, then goes to Lace's to spend time with her and her children. The FBI agent shows up, but Lace persuades him to let George die in peace. George and Lace share a romantic and intimate time, but he informs her that he is about to die and she cries as she holds him.  Professor Ringold arrives at Lace's house, only to learn that he is too late. Lace gives him George's research materials, so he can finish George's breakthrough work.  A year later, George's friends are gathered for what would have been his 38th birthday. Nate, now fluent in Portuguese, is married to a visibly pregnant Ella. Other signs of George's phenomenal impact on the town and its people are seen all around.  
Police Story 4: First Strike
 Whilst working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], Jackie ([[Jackie Chan]]) is assigned to follow leads of a nuclear smuggling case. He follows a woman named Natasha to Ukraine, when he realizes that she had been hiding vital information, Jackie calls for backup and she is later arrested. However, Natasha's partner is an unknown man, who turns out to be Jackson Tsui (Jackson Lou), a Chinese-American nuclear scientist with CIA links, suspected of stealing a nuclear warhead. Jackie follows Tsui to a restricted area, and after a trap set by Tsui, the CIA agents together with Ukrainian authorities engage in battle. Jackie finds a briefcase which contained evidence from Tsui, but as he is chased by unknown forces, Ka-kui loses the briefcase as he falls into frozen waters.  When he recovers in Russia, he meets Colonel Gregor Yegorov ([[Yuriy Petrov]]) who explains the situation. Jackie goes with the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] and is taken to Moscow where he discovers he has been assigned to work with Gregor to solve a similar case involving [[nuclear weapons]] being smuggled out of [[Ukraine]]. His task is to track Tsui, who disappeared after their last encounter. He is taken by a Russian submarine to [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]], where Tsui's younger sister Annie  ([[Annie Wu (actress)|Wu Chen-chun]]) works at an aquarium doing shark shows. Uncle 7 (Terry Woo), the Tsuis' father and the local [[Triad (underground societies)|Triad]] boss, is seriously ill and Jackie suspects the criminal will show up soon. Unknown to Jackie, Tsui is hiding at the hospital and has given a nuclear warhead (disguised as a small oxygen tank) to Annie, who hides it at the aquarium.  While following Annie, Jackie gets held up by Tsui, who claims to have a deal with Gregor. Jackie, after realizing he has been used by Gregor, decides to return home, but two men are sent to kill him, and he is framed for the murder of Uncle 7. He attempts to clear his name by going to see Annie at the memorial hall, but he is (unsurprisingly) unwelcome, having to fight bodyguards until Tsui arrives to clear Jackie's name. Tsui explains that Gregor caught him on a CIA assignment three years before, and forced him to turn into a [[triple agent]]: a CIA agent ostensibly turned by the FSB, but in reality serving Gregor's private criminal schemes.  Annie, Jackie, and Tsui decide to work together to find Gregor and bring him in. Uncle 7's elaborate Chinatown funeral becomes the scene for a complex shootout between the various parties. Annie and Jackie attempt to retrieve the stolen warhead from the shark pool (so that they can return it to the police), but Gregor and his men follow them, leading to a climactic confrontation underwater. During the fight, Gregor shoots the aquarium and shatters the glass which releases the killer shark. During the confusion, Gregor escapes with the warhead and kidnaps Annie to a getaway boat. Jackie then saves the tourists from the shark and pursues Gregor. While Gregor escapes in the getaway boat, Jackie finds and drives a [[Mitsubishi FTO]] display car onto the boat as Annie escapes its landing. The car pins Gregor and allows Jackie to successfully retrieve the warhead and saves Annie.  Gregor and Tsui are apprehended by Australian police and turned over to Russian authorities. The case is solved, and Jackie is thanked for his work by the FSB and returns to his work in Hong Kong.  
Poison Ivy II: Lily
 Lily is a sheltered art student from Michigan attending college in California. She finds an apartment, and she soon notices her roommates, Tanya (a friendly [[lesbian]] artist who becomes a good friend to Lily), Bridgette (a cruel and taunting artist who initially takes an immediate dislike to her), and Robert (the silent but talented musician), all art students, aren't quite normal. For the first time out of her village, she is still used to her protected life in Michigan and frequently calls her parents.  One day she discovers a box of items belonging to Ivy, a girl she has never met before. In the box, she finds nude pictures of the girl and her diary.

Gredin grows even more attracted to her and it doesn't take long before they start having sex. He is unamused by the amount of private time she spends with Donald, though, but she explains it's because of the babysitting. She inspires Donald to perform art again, having noticed that he's long been afraid to express himself. She agrees to pose nude for him, and also finds her own way to express herself in the meantime as well. During this process, he secretly falls in love with her, which has a great deal of impact on his marriage to Angela. However through the movie, it can be shown that Donald's infatuation with her soon deepens to obsession.  One day, Lily catches Gredin and Bridgette together. Feeling upset, she pierces her belly button and she starts to rebel, thereby estranging herself from her friends.

Pinocchio's Revenge
 Despite the evidence presented by the district attorney ([[Larry Cedar]]), Jennifer Garrick ([[Rosalind Allen]]), the lawyer defending Vincent Gotto ([[Lewis Van Bergen]]), an accused child murderer on death row, believes her client is not guilty, and is hiding the identity of the real killer. A fellow attorney in her office ([[Ron Canada]]) explains the presence of a large Pinocchio doll sitting in her chair as belatedly delivered evidence which she had earlier requisitioned (the doll had been buried by her client in his son's grave). Intending to examine it in the hope of finding a clue which might prevent his execution, she brings it home and her emotionally fragile daughter Zoe ([[Brittany Alyse Smith]]) mistakes it for a birthday gift. She develops a relationship with the puppet and becomes unbalanced to an even greater degree.   Soon, she even believes the doll to be real and talk with it, although this is not out of the ordinary as she held a similar relationship with her other dolls. Trouble takes off when a school mate of Zoe who bullied her is pushed in front of a bus, which Zoe blames on Pinocchio trying to protect her. Soon after, Jennifer's boyfriend David Kaminsky ([[Todd Allen (actor)|Todd Allen]]) is knocked down the basement stairs while baby sitting Zoe, but is saved by Zoe calling 911. Later, Zoe is at one of her therapy sessions when her psychiatrist Dr. Edwards ([[Aaron Lustig]]) has to leave the room, and Zoe begins talking with Pinocchio about who is to blame for David's accident, with both placing blame on one another.   A surveillance video in the room is watched by the mother and the psychiatrist and it is revealed that Zoe is talking to herself. That night, Pinocchio convinces Zoe to set him free so that he can admit to David that he is to blame for his accident. Zoe makes him promise he will not do anything bad and cuts his strings, at which point Pinocchio hops up, declaring his freedom and takes off down the dark streets with Zoe in pursuit. Through a first-person perspective, we see an unknown person move through the hospital through crowds of people into David's room and unplug one of his machines, killing him.   Jennifer questions Zoe who claims she got lost as she and Pinocchio try to find the hospital and never went there which causes an angry and confused Jennifer to lock Pinocchio in the trunk of her car. That night, Zoe is left in the care of the babysitter Sophia (Candace McKenzie), when Sophia reminds her that Zoe gave Pinocchio a conscience (a cricket caught earlier in the film). Zoe runs to her room to check on it and finds it smashed and begins screaming. Sophia runs to make sure she is okay where she is struck by a fireplace poker from an unknown assailant until she is dead. Jennifer arrives home that night during a thunderstorm to find the babysitter dead and Zoe standing in a dark hallway quiet. When Jennifer tries to confront Zoe, she runs away in a panic. As Jennifer explores the house, she is struck by the poker and sees her daughter standing above her with it in her hand.  Her daughter explains that she just managed to get the poker away from Pinocchio but they must escape quickly, but before Jennifer can inquire further, Zoe is gone. Jennifer stands up to see Pinocchio standing in the room, at which point he suddenly turns towards her and attacks her with a knife, following with a chase and battle through the house. Jennifer throws Pinocchio through a glass coffee table and sees that her daughter is suddenly lying there in his place. The movie closes with a catatonic Zoe being committed and Jennifer stating it was not her and that she will not give up until she gets better and can leave, to which Dr. Edwards states, "I hope not, for your sake, I hope not."

"Pompous Ass"? "Pom-pom tits"? "Poconos"?  
Ponette
  Before the film begins, Ponette's mother dies in a car crash, which Ponette herself survives with only a broken arm (she consequently must wear an arm cast). Following her mother's death, Ponette's father (Xavier Beauvois) leaves the young girl with her Aunt Claire ([[Claire Nebout]]), and her cousins Matiaz (Matiaz Bureau Caton) and Delphine (Delphine Schiltz).

In the end, Ponette visits a cemetery and cries for her mother, who suddenly appears to comfort her and ask her to live her life and not be sad all the time.  Her mother says she cannot keep coming back, so Ponette must move on and go be happy with her father. Then it appears that her mother gives her a sweater that she did not bring to the cemetery, and her father comments when he sees her that "I haven't seen that sweater in a while".

The Preacher's Wife
 A voiceover by the child Jeremiah (Justin Pierre Edmund) guides the viewer through the film.  Rev. Henry Biggs ([[Courtney B. Vance]]) is the [[pastor]] of a small struggling [[Baptist]] church in a poverty-stricken neighborhood of New York City. Membership is declining, Henry is pulled in a hundred directions by his parishioners' needs, and the church's finances are in trouble. Henry is under intense pressure from real estate developer Joe Hamilton ([[Gregory Hines]]) to sell the church's property so that Hamilton can build luxury condominiums on the site. Henry has also become neglectful of his wife, Julia ([[Whitney Houston]]), and his son, Jeremiah. Julia worries that her marriage is failing. Unsure that he can make a difference in his parishioners' lives and beginning to lose his faith, Henry prays to God for help, which comes in the form of Dudley ([[Denzel Washington]]), a witty and debonair [[angel]]. Dudley tells Henry that he is an angel sent by God to help him, but Henry is deeply suspicious of Dudley.  Julia, however, is instantly charmed by the handsome and unflappable angel.  With Christmas approaching, Henry's schedule becomes increasingly burdensome, and Dudley begins to spend most of his time with Julia and Jeremiah. Rev. Biggs' secretary, Beverly ([[Loretta Devine]]), becomes comically defensive and aggressive, believing Dudley is there to take her job. Julia's wasp-tongued mother, Margueritte ([[Jenifer Lewis]]), is also suspicious of Dudley, because she believes the newcomer will break up her daughter's marriage. Dudley and Julia go ice skating, and then later spend an evening in the jazz club where Julia once performed. After Henry confronts Dudley, Dudley realizes that he is falling in love with Julia. So, Dudley turns his attention to Hamilton and manages to disrupt his schemes to get Henry to sell the church.

At the church's Christmas pageant, Henry finds his faith in God renewed and ties to his family restored.

Dudley then erases all memories of himself from everyone he has met, and although he attends midnight service on [[Christmas Eve]], no one recognizes him. However, Jeremiah, who has the faith of a child, still remembers Dudley, and wishes him a merry Christmas.  A subplot present throughout the film focuses on Julia's singing talents. Once a popular nightclub singer, she is now a star in the church [[choir]]. This subplot provides for several [[set piece (film)|set piece]]s in which the choir performs, and [[Gospel music]] plays a significant role. It also provides comic relief in the form of a domineering choir member, played by Houston's real life mother, Cissy.  
Primal Fear (film)
 Martin Vail ([[Richard Gere]]) is a [[Chicago]] defense attorney who loves the spotlight and does everything he can to get his high-profile clients acquitted on legal technicalities. One day, he sees a news report about the arrest of Aaron Stampler ([[Edward Norton]]), a 19-year-old [[Altar server|altar boy]] from [[Kentucky]] with a severe [[Stuttering|stutter]], who is accused of brutally murdering the beloved [[Archbishop]] Rushman ([[Stanley Anderson]]). Vail jumps at the chance to represent the young man, [[pro bono]].  During his meetings at the County jail with Stampler, Vail comes to believe that his client is innocent, much to the chagrin of the [[prosecutor]] (and Vail's former lover), Janet Venable ([[Laura Linney]]).  As the trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt [[state's attorney]] John Shaughnessy ([[John Mahoney]]), have lost millions of dollars in [[real estate]] investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop on certain church lands. The Archbishop received numerous death threats as a result. Following a tip from a former altar boy about a videotape involving Stampler, Vail makes a search of the Archbishop's apartment and finds a [[VHS]] tape of Stampler being forced to have sex with another altar boy and a girl named Linda Forbes. Vail is now in a dilemma: introducing this evidence would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury; but it would also give him a motive for the murder, which Venable is unable to establish.  When Vail confronts his client and accuses him of having lied, Stampler breaks down crying and suddenly transforms into a new persona: a violent [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] who calls himself "Roy" and confesses to the murder of the Archbishop. When this incident is over, Stampler once again becomes passive and shy, and appears to have no recollection of the personality switch - what he calls having "lost time." Molly Arrington ([[Frances McDormand]]), the [[psychiatrist]] examining Stampler, is convinced that he has [[dissociative identity disorder]] caused by years of [[child abuse|abuse]] at the hands of his father. Vail does not want to hear this, because he knows that he cannot enter an [[Insanity defense|insanity plea]] during an ongoing trial.  Vail slowly sets up a confrontation in court by dropping hints about the Archbishop's [[abuse of power|abusive tendencies]], as well as Stampler's multiple personalities. He also has the sex tape delivered to Venable, knowing she will realize who sent it and—since she is under intense pressure from both Shaughnessy and her boss Bud Yancy to deliver a guilty verdict—will use it as proof of motive.  Vail puts Stampler on the witness stand and gently questions him about the abuse he suffered at the Archbishop's hands. After Venable questions him harshly during cross-examination, Stampler turns into "Roy" in open court and attacks her, threatening to snap her neck if anyone comes near him. He is subdued by courthouse marshals and rushed back to his holding cell. The judge dismisses the jury in favor of a [[bench trial]] and then finds Stampler [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]], remanding him to a maximum security [[Psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]]. Venable is fired for losing the case and allowing the Archbishop's crimes, which both the Catholic Church and the city council had been trying to hide for the past ten years, to come to public light.  Vail visits Stampler in his cell to tell him of the dismissal. Stampler says he recalls nothing of what happened in the courtroom, having again "lost time". Just as Vail is leaving, Stampler asks him to "tell Miss Venable I hope her neck is okay", which he could not have been able to remember if he had "lost time". When Vail confronts him, Stampler reveals that he had [[Feigned madness|faked multiple personality disorder]]. No longer stuttering, he brags about having murdered Archbishop Rushman, as well as Linda. When Vail says "There never was a Roy", Stampler replies, "There never was an ''Aaron'', counselor". A stunned and disillusioned Vail walks away as Stampler taunts him from his cell.

Project ALF
 The film begins where ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'' had ended, with Gordon Shumway&mdash;otherwise known as ALF, short for Alien Life Form&mdash;being captured by the [[US Air Force]]'s Alien Task Force while attempting to depart Earth. ALF is kept under lock and key at Edmonds Air Force Base under the xenophobic orders of Colonel Milfoil ([[Martin Sheen]]), although he manages to charm his airman jailers and convert his cell into a bachelor pad. Acting on his own initiative, Milfoil plans on killing his prisoner under the guise of a beauty treatment, for which he has left a paper trail implicating his aide de camp, Lieutenant Reese (Scott Michael Campbell), setting him up as a scapegoat. They talk about ALF's relationship with the [[List of ALF characters|Tanner family]], and the Tanners' move to [[Iceland]].  Learning of this, two Air Force scientists&mdash;Major Melissa Hill ([[Jensen Daggett]]) and Capt. Rick Mullican ([[William O'Leary (actor)|William O'Leary]])&mdash;help ALF escape, going to ground at a cheap motel. After ALF makes a nuisance of himself, he is ordered to go hide in the restroom, reminding him of when the Tanners would do the same. Unwilling to do without his creature comforts, ALF sneaks outside and contacts one of his former guards in an attempt to arrange a supply drop, before mistakenly entering a [[strip club]], assuming from its name that it is an eating establishment that serves cats.  With both the local police and the military alerted, the three of them turn to Dexter Moyers ([[Miguel Ferrer]]), a former NASA scientist falsely discredited by the government as part of the anti-UFO conspiracy. His solution is to publicly reveal ALF's existence on global television, removing the US government's credibility and vindicating himself, but Rick grows increasingly uncomfortable with the idea. After accidentally stumbling across a computer file that hints at a deeper agenda, Rick departs during the night. The following day, he contacts a friend at Edmonds, aware that Milfoil will be monitoring the conversation and come directly to him. As predicted, he is arrested shortly after and brokers a deal, exchanging safe conduct for the three fugitives in return for revealing the impending broadcast.  Meanwhile, Melissa learns that Moyers has set up a secret auction alongside the broadcast, intending to sell the alien to the highest bidder. After she refuses to take part, he imprisons her. ALF, unaware of the betrayal, revels in being the center of attention until stage fright and the increasing hostility of his host lead ALF to lock himself in the bathroom, giving the military time to shut down the broadcast. Both Melissa and ALF are arrested, and Milfoil reneges on the deal. In doing so, he unwittingly reveals his murderous intentions on a security recording, which finds its way into the hands of Lt. Reese.  Back at Edmonds, Milfoil gloats that ALF's escape means he will be able to convince his superiors to have the alien executed openly, his hatred being revealed as seeking payback for his mother going mad as the result of alleged alien abduction. However, Reese interrupts a meeting between Milfoil and General Stone to play the tape, revealing the Colonel's malfeasance.  A military panel authorizes promotions for the three officers involved in taking down Milfoil and apologizes to ALF, before declaring him an ambassador to Earth. The scene ends with ALF's usual self-aggrandizing behavior leaving the people on the panel to wonder if they've made the right choice.

With a combination of design vision, mechanical skills, knowledge of batteries, and lightweight drivers, the students design and build a solar-powered car they name "Cockroach."  Their team manages to outperform a corporate-sponsored car and win the local [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] competition by correctly predicting cloudy weather based on the surfing experience of the student captain, Daniel ([[Casey Affleck]]). Cloudy weather would make their vehicle's battery capacity a more important factor than its weight.  With the shop teacher as chaperone ([[James Belushi]]), the students travel to Australia to compete in the World Solar Challenge. To the relief of their corporate sponsor ([[Kevin Tighe]]), who is still bitter over the loss of his company-built vehicle in Hawaii, their car is delayed at the very start of the race. However, the students choose to persevere and remain in the race.  A sand storm and other difficulties provide occasions for heroism. Uni Kakamura ([[Sara Tanaka]]) pilots the car through difficult terrain, but has an accident and is rescued by Gilbert ([[J. Moki Cho]]). After Cindy ([[Eliza Dushku]]) is disqualified from driving for drinking alcohol, Eduardo ([[Anthony Ruivivar]]) puts aside his "lolo-haole" conflict with Daniel and reduces the car to allow the overweight Gilbert to drive so that the team can finish the race.

Enraged all the more, Raj seeks Mala out, and in the presence of her pupils, brutally slaps and then rapes her by taking off her clothes. Then she walks out without any clothes with her pupils, who hide her body with an umbrella as it was raining and all the passers-by behold her, and when her father sees her in this way, he throws a piece of cloth on her to cover her body. The police get involved and Raj is arrested.   Raj's dad, Rai Bahadur Diwanchand, attempts to give some money to Mala's guardian, Gyani Kartar Singh, who refuses to accept it. Raj's brother-in-law and sister support Mala and defend her in the case. The court case proceeds; the judge, overcome by Mala's evidence, finds Raj guilty, convicts him, and orders that he marry Mala in the next twenty-four hours. Raj's attempts to kill Mala are in vain, and they get married without great pomp and ceremony. After the marriage, Rai Bahadur goes overseas and leaves his family, especially his elder daughter-in-law, Sharda, to deal with Mala and ensure that she is belittled, tortured, and eventually driven out of their house. Sharda's younger sister tries to make Raj get trapped in her love, but she fails because Mala insults her and goes to her sister.   Sharda, her younger sister and a silly brother go to the airport which Raj reaches before they leave. The three make up lies that Mala told them to get out of the house.

The Quiet Room
 ''The Quiet Room'' centers on an unnamed little girl and how she deals with her parents' crumbling marriage. The film focuses entirely on her point of view and although she is silent for most of the film, we constantly hear her thoughts, sometimes in a stream of conscious barrage of voice-over. The little girl has chosen to become mute as a way to protest her parents' constant fighting. Her parents, more concerned with their own issues, believe their daughter is just going through a phase. The film shows how even very young children can be extremely cognizant of problems that are going on in their own homes even when their parents try hard to shield them from everything.   The girl learns other ways to communicate with her parents. Through her drawings she expresses her desire of owning a dog and how she believes they will be happier as a family if they lived in the country instead of in their tiny apartment in the city. During flashbacks, we see when her parents were happy and still in love. The girl, perhaps intentionally as a way to cope, confuses tenses (thinking "I'm little now..." instead of "when I was little..."). But even then, she catches glimpses of her parents' dysfunctional relationship, such as when her father spits in her mother's face after she yells at him. Her parents don't notice she is in the room but the memory leaves a long lasting impression on her. In the present, her anxiety manifests itself through waking nightmares where she imagines wild animals escaping from the zoo and coming to get her. At the end of the film, she hides herself in her parents' wardrobe to escape their bickering. After a while, she falls asleep in an uncomfortable position. When she wakes up, she is too stiff to move. Unable to escape on her own, the little girl finally breaks down and calls out for help and her parents, who had thought she ran away, rush to her aid.  The girl gives her parents one last drawing. In it, she successfully conveys her feelings of being overwhelmed by her parents' constant fighting and how she feels less motivated to speak the more she hears them argue. As she hands it to them, she says, "This is how I feel. That's how ''you'' make me feel." Finally hearing their daughter for the first time and realizing the effect their behavior has on hers, her parents announce that they're going to move to the country. When they also promise her a dog, she becomes so ecstatic that she starts singing incessantly and dancing around her room.

Sean is taken to an apartment by Maris, a caterer for the Mullens, along with criminals Clark, Cubby and Miles, and Detective Jimmy Shaker, Maris' boyfriend and the mastermind behind the kidnapping. Tom and Kate receive an e-mail from the kidnappers demanding $2,000,000. Tom calls the FBI, who begin operating from his New York City penthouse under Special Agent Lonnie Hawkins. In private, Tom voices his belief that a union machinist, Jackie Brown, who is in prison following one of Mullen's business scandals, may have been behind it. They visit Brown in prison, but he angrily denies any involvement with the kidnapping.  Tom agrees to the FBI's instructions for delivering the [[ransom]]. Receiving a phone call from Shaker, who is electronically disguising his voice, Tom follows his instructions. He meets Cubby in a New Jersey quarry but refuses to hand the money over when Cubby fails to give him the directions Shaker had promised him. A fight ensues and the FBI intervene and shoot Cubby. He dies before he can reveal Sean's location. Shaker later arranges another drop off. While Tom initially agrees to take the money alone, he realizes there is no guarantee Sean will be returned alive and instead appears on television to offer the ransom as a bounty on the kidnappers' heads, promising to withdraw the bounty and drop all charges if the kidnappers return his son alive and unharmed.  Despite the pleadings of Kate and FBI Special Agent Lonnie Hawkins, Tom sticks to his plan, believing it is the best chance of having Sean returned. Shaker lures Kate to a meeting where he tells her to pay the ransom or Sean will die before ditching Sean's blood stained t-shirt. Tom responds by increasing the bounty to $4,000,000. Shaker calls Tom and demands to be paid, but Tom still refuses, and Shaker fires a gunshot after Tom hears Sean scream for help, leading Tom and Kate to believe their son is dead. Clark and Miles attempt to abandon the plan and flee, but Shaker calls in the NYPD to request backup and kills both of his men while making it look like Miles shot first, and kills Maris after she shoots him in the arm from behind. The NYPD arrive and find Shaker with Sean, believing Shaker found and rescued the boy. Hawkins informs Tom and Kate and they are reunited with their son while Shaker is hospitalized. Tom also recognizes Maris.  Shaker later pays Tom a visit to claim the reward and leave the country before investigators discover his connection with Maris. Tom and Sean, however, recognize Shaker as the kidnapper, and Shaker realizes this. Though his initial plan is to kill everyone in the apartment, Tom persuades him to accompany him to the bank to gain the money and leave peacefully. On the way, however, Tom discreetly alerts Hawkins and the police and FBI converge on Tom and Shaker outside the bank. As soon as Tom and Shaker exit the bank, two officers (who greeted Shaker and Tom before entering the bank) inform Shaker that he is going to be detained, causing Shaker to shoot them down before Tom knocks him to the ground after which a chase ensues in which Tom and Shaker grapple furiously before falling through a shop window, severely injuring both and impaling Shaker through the neck. Tom picks up a hidden pistol (that Shaker pulled out during the scuffle) and points at Shaker before Hawkins and other police officers keep demanding that he drop the gun and walk away. In desperation, Shaker draws another hidden gun but is shot dead by Tom and Hawkins. Tom finally drops the gun and police rush in to arrest Tom, but Hawkins tells them to hold allowing Tom and Kate to leave the scene.

Rebirth of Mothra
 Millions of years ago, a giant three-headed dragon called [[King Ghidorah|Desghidorah]] arrives on Earth and wars with a species of enormous and highly advanced [[moth]]s. The moths were the protectors of the "Elias", a race of tiny, humanoid beings who inhabited the planet. After the ensuing battle, Desghidorah was defeated and sealed under the Earth - at the cost of almost all life on Earth.   Only three Elias - Moll, Laura and Belvera - and one last moth - [[Mothra]] - remained. To preserve her species, Mothra created an egg in 1996; however, she became physically exhausted from the ordeal. Shortly thereafter, a logging company uncovered the subterranean prison of the demonic space beast that had ravaged the Earth so long ago. When the seal that had bound the creature was removed from the area, one of the workers of the company took it home and gave it to his young daughter, Wakaba, as a souvenir. Seizing the advantage, Belvera controls Wakaba and uses her to torment her brother Taiki, reminding Belvera of her hatred towards her sisters.  Moll and Lora, riding a smaller Mothra named Fairy, then fought Belvera for control of the artifact. Belvera prevailed and managed to release Desghidorah from its rocky tomb to exact her warped plans for destruction of the human race. Mothra was summoned to halt the detestable dragon, which was absorbing the life out of the environment. She fought a long and difficult battle to repel her ancient adversary, and in response to her declining strength, her young son, named Mothra Leo, hatched prematurely to assist his mother. Though his energized silk seemed to turn the tide of battle in the favor of the protectors, Desghidorah sank the teeth of two of his heads deep into Leo and Mothra became desperate. She quickly airlifted her son to safety, and to keep Desghidorah at bay, lured the beast to a dam. With Desghidorah distracted by a wall of raging water, Mothra carried her son to safety. Unfortunately, Mothra's wounds, age, and weariness were ultimately too much. Her strength failed, and after lowering her child carefully into the sea, she fell exhausted onto the waves and sank to her death.  The distraught larva attempted to save his beloved mother, but to no avail.  Angered, the young moth created a cocoon and began to change into his adult form. Desghidorah had to be defeated; his mother's death couldn't be in vain. Desghidorah then went on a rampage, destroying everything in its path as the humans watched helplessly. Moll and Lora, who had befriended Taiki and Wakaba, encouraged them to have hope and reminded them that Mothra would be reborn to save the Earth. Fortunately, Leo emerged into his adult form as a swarm of multi-colored butterflies. As the butterflies coalesced into one massive insect, Leo took to the air and headed back towards Desghidorah, righteous fury burning in his wake. Arriving in a hail of energy beams, Leo relentlessly blasted his mother's murderer, throwing wave upon wave of searing beams and energy blasts at Desghidorah, who could only feebly attempt to defend himself against this, the most powerful Mothra of all time. Drawing upon an ancient legacy, Leo relentlessly assaulted Desghidorah, eventually renewing the seal that bound the world destroyer beneath the soil of the earth; but his work was not done with the end of the fight.  Drawing upon the power of life that filled his very being, Leo restored the balance to a blasted region that was deforested during the assault of Desghidorah. His work done for the time being, Leo went to his ancestral home and planet Earth was once again safe from Desghidorah. Moll and Lora thanked the children for helping them on their journey and returned home to Infant Island with their pet, Fairy, as Belvera, still vengeful, escaped into a hole in a tree.

Ridicule
 The film begins in 1783 with the Chevalier de Milletail ([[Carlo Brandt]]) visiting the elderly Monsieur de Blayac ([[Lucien Pascal]]), confined to his chair. He taunts him about his past prowess in wit and reminds him of how he humiliated him, naming him "Marquis de Clatterbang" when he fell over while dancing. He then urinates on the helpless old man.  The film then shifts to the [[Dombes]], a boggy region north of Lyon. The Baron Grégoire Ponceludon de Malavoy ([[Charles Berling]]) is a minor aristocrat and engineer. He is one of the few aristocrats who care about the plight of the peasants. Horrified by the sickness and death caused by the mosquitoes that infest the swamps, he hopes to drain them; he goes to Versailles in the hope of obtaining the backing of King Louis XVI ([[Urbain Cancelier]]).  Just before reaching Versailles, Ponceludon is robbed and beaten. He is found by the Marquis de Bellegarde ([[Jean Rochefort]]), a minor noble and physician. As Ponceludon recuperates at the marquis' house, Bellegarde takes him under his wing, teaching him about wit (''l'esprit''), the primary way to make one's way at court. At first, Ponceludon's provincial background makes him a target at parties and gatherings, even though he proves himself a formidable adversary in verbal sparring.  At one such party, he catches L'abbé de Vilecourt ([[Bernard Giraudeau]]) cheating at a game of wits, with the help of his lover, Madame de Blayac ([[Fanny Ardant]]), the beautiful and rich recent widow of Monsieur de Blayac, who was to have been Ponceludon's sponsor at court. Blayac repays his generosity in not exposing them by arranging for the certification of his lineage—thereby allowing his suit to proceed. Despite his success, Ponceludon begins to see that the court at Versailles is corrupt and hollow.  In one notable example, a bumbling noble of the court, Monsieur de Guéret, falls asleep during a roll call to partake in court with the [[King Louis XVI]]. L'abbé de Vilecourt, seeing that the noble is asleep, removes the noble's shoe, throwing it in a fireplace, and mimics a call for him. The noble wakes upon hearing his name, but finding out he has only a single shoe, is terribly distraught. To attend court without the proper clothes is a social impossibility, and because of this, the noble is forced to leave. He is so terribly distraught with his own failure that he later hangs himself in the garden.  The only exception is Mathilde de Bellegarde ([[Judith Godrèche]]), the doctor's daughter. She has agreed to marry Monsieur de Montaliéri, a rich, old aristocrat whose wife is dying. Her motivation is twofold: to support her science experiments and to help pay off her father's debts. Ponceludon begins to help her with her experiments. Montaliéri observes their growing attraction to each other. Later, Montaliéri tells Ponceludon that he should wait, as he is not likely to live very long, and Mathilde would be a rich widow. Even after Mathilde admits that she dreads her upcoming marriage, Ponceludon does not want her to end up the wife of a poor man.  One day, a deaf-mute named Paul runs through the woods wearing Mathilde’s diving suit and frightens Madame de Blayac. Blayac makes Bellegarde send him away. Bellegarde sends the boy to the [[Abbé de l'Épée]], a pioneering educator of the deaf.  Mathilde visits Madame de Blayac and unsuccessfully pleads for Paul. Madame de Blayac senses a rival for Ponceludon. Meanwhile Vilecourt is concerned that Ponceludon is becoming too successful, so Madame de Blayac promises to bring him down. Madame de Blayac traps Ponceludon at a dinner party (with her accomplice Montaliéri) where one too many guests has been invited. A contest of wit is used to settle who must make a humiliating departure. Distracted by Blayac, Ponceludon loses, and is convinced that his disgrace will force him to leave the court. However, he is reminded of why he set out in the first place when a village child dies from drinking contaminated water. During this time, Mathilde appears at court, breaking the terms of her engagement contract.  Vilecourt finally obtains an audience with the King, but blunders by accidentally blaspheming against God in an attempt to be witty, and Blayac turns her attention back to Ponceludon, convincing him to return to Versailles. He sleeps with her in exchange for her assistance; she arranges a meeting with the King. She maliciously has Bellegarde attend her in his capacity as physician when Ponceludon is still with her, ensuring that Mathilde learns of their relationship.  During a presentation at court of the [[Abbé de l'Épée]]'s work with deaf people and development of [[sign language]], the nobles ridicule the deaf mercilessly. However, some nobles change their minds when the deaf demonstrate their own form of wit: sign language puns. In response, de Bellegarde stands and asks how to sign "bravo," leading Ponceludon to rise and clap to show his support. Mathilde is touched, and they soon make up.  Ponceludon joins the King's entourage and, after showing off his engineering prowess by proposing an improvement to a cannon, secures a private meeting with the King to discuss his project. The embarrassed cannoneer then insults Ponceludon, forcing him into demanding a duel. Madame de Blayac almost persuades him to avoid the duel, but he eventually decides to proceed, under the supervision of Bellegarde. He kills the cannoneer, but is later informed that the King cannot meet with someone who has killed one of his officers right after his death, although he is assured that it was right to uphold his honour.  Madame de Blayac is furious when she learns that Ponceludon has left her for Mathilde and plots her revenge. Ponceludon is invited to a costume ball "only for wits." Upon arriving at the ball with Mathilde, he is manoeuvered into dancing with Blayac and is tripped. His spectacular fall earns him the derisive nickname "Marquis des [[Antipodes]]" by Milletail. Ponceludon tears off his mask and condemns their decadence. He tells them that they class themselves with [[Voltaire]] because of their wit, but they have none of Voltaire's compassion. He vows to drain the swamp by himself, and leaves the court with Mathilde. Madame de Blayac removes her mask and stands silently crying.  The movie closes in Dover, England in 1794, where Bellegarde has fled from the French Revolution and where he gets a taste of the English “humour” which the nobles had discussed earlier in the film.  On-screen text states that Grégoire and Mathilde Ponceludon successfully drained the Dombes and live in revolutionary France.

The Rock (film)
 A group of rogue [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|U.S. Force Recon Marines]], led by disenchanted [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Frank Hummel and his second-in-command Major Tom Baxter, storm a heavily guarded naval weapons depot and steal a stockpile of deadly [[VX (nerve agent)|VX gas]]-armed [[M55 (rocket)|M55]] rockets, losing one of their own men in the process. The next day, Hummel and his men, along with Marine Captains Frye and Darrow, seize control of [[Alcatraz Island]], taking eighty-one tourists hostage. He threatens to launch the rockets against [[San Francisco]] unless the U.S. government pays him $100 million from a military [[slush fund]], which he will distribute to his men and the families of Recon Marines who died on clandestine missions under his command but whose deaths were not compensated.  [[The Pentagon]] and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] develop a plan to retake the island with a [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEAL]] team led by Commander Anderson, enlisting the FBI's top chemical weapons specialist, Dr. Stanley Goodspeed. [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Director]] James Womack is forced to offer a pardon to federal prisoner John Mason, in return for information. Mason, a 60-year-old British national imprisoned without charges for three decades, is the only Alcatraz inmate ever to escape the island. After being set up in a hotel, Mason escapes, resulting in a car chase with Goodspeed through the streets of San Francisco. While seeking out his estranged daughter, Jade, Goodspeed arrives, but covers for Mason by telling Jade that he is aiding the FBI.  Goodspeed, Mason, and the SEALs infiltrate Alcatraz but Hummel's men are alerted to their presence and ambush them in a shower room. All the SEALs are killed, leaving only Mason and Goodspeed alive. Mason sees his chance to escape custody and disarms Goodspeed, but is convinced to help Goodspeed defuse the rockets after the Marines use explosive devices to flush them out.  They eliminate several teams of Marines and disable 12 of the 15 rockets by removing their guidance chips. Hummel threatens to execute a hostage if they do not surrender and return the guidance chips; instead, Mason destroys the chips and surrenders to Hummel to try and reason with him as well as buy Goodspeed some time. Though Goodspeed disables another rocket, the Marines capture him. With the incursion team lost, the military initiates their backup plan: an airstrike by [[F/A-18]]s with [[thermite]] plasma, which will neutralize the poison gas but kill everyone on the island.  Mason and Goodspeed escape, and Mason explains why he was held prisoner: he was a British [[Special Air Service|SAS]] Captain who stole a microfilm containing details of the United States' most closely guarded secrets, refusing to give it up when captured because he knew he would be killed if he did. When the deadline for the transfer of the ransom passes, Hummel fires one of the rockets, but then redirects it to detonate at sea. He reveals to the Marines that the mission is over and that it was all an elaborate bluff as he never had any intention of taking innocent lives. Hummel orders them to exit Alcatraz with a few hostages and the remaining rocket to cover their retreat while he assumes blame. Frye and Darrow rebel upon realizing they will not be paid their $1 million apiece, killing Baxter and mortally wounding Hummel, who tells Goodspeed where the last rocket is before dying.  Darrow and Frye proceed with the plan to fire on San Francisco. Goodspeed seeks out the rocket while Mason deals with the remaining Marines. As the jets approach, Goodspeed disables the rocket before killing both Darrow and Frye. He signals that the threat is over just as one jet drops a bomb; though no hostages are injured, Goodspeed is thrown into the sea by the blast and Mason rescues him.  Goodspeed and Mason part ways after Mason reveals the location of the microfilm; Goodspeed fakes Mason's death by telling Womack that he was killed in the bomb explosion. Sometime later, Goodspeed and his newlywed wife Carla are seen stealing the microfilm from a church and driving away.

He meets Bill's neighbor Danny ([[Morgan Lam]]), a disabled Chinese-American boy, and his aunt-to-be Whitney ([[Carrie Cain Sparks]]), an African-American woman working at Bill's supermarket. Bill is trying to sell his supermarket, and he meets a potential buyer, Elaine ([[Anita Mui]]), who is reluctant to buy it for Bill's price. Nonetheless, Bill invites Elaine to his wedding, hoping that there's still a chance to sell it.

The next day, at the wedding, Keung helps negotiate a deal that convinces Elaine to buy the market.</ref>}}  He soon starts a rivalry with a local biker gang, led by Tony ([[Marc Akerstream]]), after beating up various members at Elaine's supermarket, which they tried to rob and vandalize. Later that night, Keung notices a woman getting abducted. He pretends to be a police officer to scare away her would-be kidnappers. However, when Keung "rescues" her, she attacks him, revealing that it was all a ploy to lure him into a spot where Tony's gang attacks him again. Keung fends off several gangsters, but gets cornered into a dead-end alleyway. The gang severely injures him by swatting glass bottles around him. Afterwards, Keung almost makes it back to his Uncle's apartment, but not before fainting in front of Nancy ([[Francoise Yip]]), who is Tony's girlfriend and the woman who lured Keung earlier. It is revealed that Nancy is Danny's neglectful older sister, and she fixes Keung's wounds upon realizing that Keung is a friend of Danny. Danny informs Keung about Nancy's help the next morning, but Keung still doesn't know that Nancy was the one who lured him.  Later that morning, Keung goes to Elaine's market to inform her that he lost the contract (during the alleyway brawl with the gang). The supermarket is a mess due to a failed attempt to stop thieves, and Elaine informs Keung about her desire to back out of the deal upon realizing how often the market is a victim of theft and a protection racket. When two thugs demanding "protection money" come by, Keung scares them away. However, Tony and his gang come back to the store, demanding "compensation" for Keung hurting them earlier. Elaine gives into their demand, and they rob and vandalize the store. Keung confronts them outside, and tells the gang that he's the boss of the store. After Elaine is assaulted, Keung reveals that he has called the police on them.

Later, a member of Tony's gang member named Angelo ([[Garvin Cross]]) gets involved in an illegal diamond deal gone bad and steals the diamonds. A criminal syndicate led by White Tiger ([[Kris Lord]]) is after the diamonds. Keung and Danny are outside together, and they witness some of the carnage go down. Keung and Danny run inside for safety, leaving Danny's wheelchair in the apartment hallway. Unable to run and hide from the syndicate, Angelo leaves them in Danny's wheelchair cushion. Some of the syndicate members are arrested (along with Angelo), but all are let go due to a lack of evidence. Meanwhile, at Danny and Nancy's apartment, Nancy eavesdrops on a conversation between Keung and Danny, where she listens to Danny talk about the emotional difficulty of being disabled. Upon hearing this, she comes out into the living room and tearfully apologizes to Keung (but keep Danny ignorant about the specific incident).  Meanwhile, Elaine tries to scare away the thugs from the protection racket. However, they are not intimidated, and they assault her while taking her money. After this, she tries to sell the market to another Chinese couple, selling it using the same lies that Uncle Bill used to convince her. Keung witnesses this, and gives her back the check she used to buy the market, asking that she only pay him back once she makes money.</ref>}}  Later that evening, Keung goes out, but not before being questioned by the syndicate men (who are posing as [[FBI]] agents) looking for the diamonds. They give Keung a number to call if he finds anything. Later Keung visits Nancy at a nightclub where she is a lingerie dancer and model. When the gangsters see this, they chase Keung and Nancy, but they escape after Nancy knocks over their motorcycles. Keung advises her to stay away from Tony's gang and to look after Danny. A romantic relationship develops between them. After failing to confront Keung, the bikers trash Elaine's supermarket, during which two of Angelo's men are captured by White Tiger's men, who turn up at the supermarket in search of Angelo. Angelo's colleagues are unaware of his diamond heist and one is executed in a tree-shredder. Meanwhile, Keung and Nancy go to the bikers' headquarters after the latest supermarket attack, and Keung defeats them in another brawl. After the brawl, he berates and insults the gang for their criminal lifestyle and urges them to change for the better. Immediately after, one of the gangsters comes back to the hideout, with the executed gangster's remains, which he reveals was a warning to return the goods that Angelo stole. Keung agrees to help Tony and his gang.  Keung contacts the syndicate (which he thought was the FBI) after they find Angelo. Angelo reveals that he hid the diamonds in Danny's wheelchair. Tony, Angelo, and Nancy are taken hostage while some of White Tiger's thugs go with Keung to Danny and Nancy's apartment. Keung eventually subdues the gangsters after they find the diamonds. When White Tiger calls one of the gangsters, Keung takes the cell phone and reveals that he has his diamonds and his thugs held hostage. White Tiger tells him that he'll arrange an exchange and warns him not to contact the police. Keung makes Danny wait at school for his own safety. When one of the syndicate thugs interrogates Tony, demanding Keung's whereabouts, Tony tells him that Keung is the owner of the Wa-Ha supermarket. Keung goes to Elaine for advice, but later, the syndicate's thugs destroy the supermarket with a tow truck, as a warning to Keung.  Keung decides to call the police for help. They give Keung recording equipment and instruct him to just show the gangsters one diamond, and to try to get the gang to talk about the murder and robbery. However, the syndicate men realize that Keung is working with the police, and they take Keung to a secret place to have him executed. However, Keung overpowers them and attempts to escape. Later, the police come and chase the gangsters away. White Tiger's men hijack a hovercraft and are pursued by Keung and the [[New York Police Department]] in the [[Hudson River]]. The hovercraft ends up running through the streets, causing much damage to property. Keung ends the chase by stealing a large sword from a museum, clamping it onto a sports car window and driving into the [[hovercraft]], shredding the rubber skirt and crashing the vehicle. After shooting one of the syndicate men non-fatally to force them to reveal White Tiger's location, Keung drives the repaired hovercraft to a golf course where White Tiger is playing with subordinates. He runs them over, leaving White Tiger naked on the ground.

Satan Returns
 Ching, an officer in the [[Hong Kong Police Force|Royal Hong Kong Police Force]], has been experiencing the same nightmare where she sees a woman with her heart taken out and dies while being inverted on a cross. Later, during a hostage situation, Ching, who has never fired a gun before, manages to shoot the armed thug dead and rescue the hostage. When she moves closer to where the thug was taking cover earlier, she sees the horrible image that has been appearing in her nightmare: the dead body of a woman hanging on an [[Cross of St. Peter|inverted cross]].  Ching's colleagues, Nam and Ka-ming, are put in charge of investigating this case. All the evidence from the crime scene – from symbols in the [[Book of Revelation]] written in blood on the woman's body to the inverted cross – suggests that the case is related to a Satanic cult. Nam and Ka-ming get Ching to help them with the case because she is knowledgeable about religious symbols.  Judas, Satan's messenger, is wandering around Hong Kong in search of his master's daughter, who is believed to be born on 6 June 1969. He is also responsible for committing the recent series of brutal murders. The police have sent three undercover policewomen as bait to lure Judas out, but their plan fails and one of the policewomen, Leon, is killed. While in a state of confusion, Ching has frequent visions of her long-lost father, who had abandoned her when she was still a child. Judas also contacts her and tells her that she is Satan's daughter, and that he will come to find her. Nam and Ka-ming are assigned to protect Ching, but they are still no match for Judas, who possesses supernatural powers.  In the early hours of 6 June 1996, Judas manages to break out of custody despite having been arrested earlier by the police. He kidnaps Ching and brings her to the rooftop of a high building, where he intends to carry out a ritual by taking out her heart. If she survives the process, then she is indeed Satan's daughter. Nam and Ka-ming come to save Ching and fight with Judas. Eventually, Nam manages to kill Judas by using a [[nail gun]] to impale him on the cross and setting him on fire. Just as the clock strikes at 6 am, Ching tests out whether she is really Satan's daughter by taking out her heart. She survives and shows her heart to Ka-ming, who screams. The movie ends.

Scream (1996 film)
  High school student [[Casey Becker]] receives a flirtatious phone call from an [[Ghostface (Scream)|unknown person]], asking her, "What's your favorite scary movie?" However, the caller turns sadistic and threatens her life. He reveals that her boyfriend [[List of Scream characters#Steven Orth|Steve Orth]] is being held hostage and demands she answer questions about horror films. After Casey gets one wrong, Steve is murdered. When Casey refuses to answer more questions, she is murdered by a masked killer. Her parents come home to find her corpse hanging from a tree.  The following day, the [[news media]] descend on the town and a police investigation begins. Meanwhile, [[Sidney Prescott]] struggles with the impending first anniversary of her mother's murder by [[Cotton Weary]]. While waiting at home for her friend, [[Tatum Riley]], Sidney receives a threatening phone call. After she hangs up she is attacked by the killer, but manages to escape.

As the sun rises and police arrive, a badly injured Dewey is taken away by ambulance and Gale makes an impromptu news report about the night's events.   
Schizopolis
 Although the film does not have a linear plot, a skeletal structure exists, telling the same story from three different perspectives divided into three acts. At the beginning of the film, Soderbergh speaks to the audience in a style meant to evoke [[Cecil B. DeMille|Cecil B. DeMille's]] introduction to ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''.<ref name="SoderberghLester1999"></ref> He states, "In the event that you find certain sequences or ideas confusing, please bear in mind that this is your fault, not ours. You will need to see the picture again and again until you understand everything."  ===Act 1=== The film's main character is Fletcher Munson (played by Soderbergh), an office employee working under Theodore Azimuth Schwitters. Schwitters is the leader of a self-help company/religion/lifestyle known as Eventualism, a clear reference to [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and [[Scientology]]. The audience sees the events unfold in the opening act through Fletcher's point of view.  Fletcher sees the underlying meaning in everything, paying more attention to what is meant, rather than what is said. As he progresses through his day the audience sees the lack of attention he is paying to the people around him, degrading to the point where he comes home for dinner and he and his wife illustrate their lack of communication by simply describing what they are saying.  :'''Fletcher:''' Generic greeting. :'''Wife:''' Generic greeting returned. :'''Fletcher:''' Imminent sustenance. :'''Wife:''' Overly dramatic statement regarding upcoming meal. :'''Fletcher:''' Oooh, false reaction indicating hunger and excitement!  When Fletcher's co-worker Lester Richards (a reference to Soderbergh's idol and mentor, filmmaker [[Richard Lester]]) unexpectedly dies while getting pictures developed at the drugstore, Fletcher must take his job as speechwriter for Schwitters. His personal life suffers because of his work, and he becomes even more detached from his wife, who is trying to cope by having an affair.  Meanwhile, Elmo Oxygen, a local exterminator, spends much of his time going from house to house, bedding the bored housewives of the men in the community who work for Schwitters (including Richards' widow). In each house he takes pictures of his genitals using various cameras he finds on tables and in cabinets. Elmo and the women speak in a nonsensical code that, for all its complexity, clearly conveys amorous intent:  :'''Housewife:''' (answering the door seductively) Arsenal. Nose army. :'''Elmo:''' (looking to see that they're alone) Nose army. Beef diaper? :'''Housewife:''' (Inviting him in) Nomenclature. As Elmo makes his rounds, he is followed by a couple in an SUV.  Fletcher finishes this act in a parking lot. Finding that his key will not work in his car door, he looks around and finds that his actual car (parked only two spots away) is an exact match for the one he is trying to get into. He goes to enter his own car when he sees a man who is his exact double climb into the car he himself just tried to enter. Fletcher follows his doppelganger home, closes his eyes, and becomes this mystery man.  ===Act 2=== Although the second act begins as a direct transition from the first, its events actually unfold simultaneously with the previous act.  The second act follows Fletcher's doppelganger, one Dr. Jeffrey Korchek. Korchek is a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[dentist]] who has been mentioned by one or two smaller characters in the first act. He is always in a jogging suit, although he only jogs from his car to the door of wherever he is going. He is also quite a fan of [[Elevator music|Muzak]].  Korchek, it turns out, is the mystery man that Fletcher's wife has been having an affair with, causing Fletcher/Korchek to comment, "Oh my god. I'm having an affair with my wife!"  Despite being with, essentially, the same man, Mrs. Munson seems to feel comfortable with Dr. Korchek. The communication is better and she feels needed and wanted. Korchek suggests she leave Fletcher and move in with him.  The next day, Korchek has breakfast with his [[heroin]]-addicted brother, who first asks to stay with Korchek, and then to borrow money. Korchek says he can't help, and that his brother should not be dealing with drug dealers anyway. The brother disagrees, and Korchek goes to work. Once there, he meets Attractive Woman Number 2 (played by the same actress as Mrs. Munson). Korchek falls instantly in love with her and writes a letter professing his love.  :''"Dear attractive woman number 2, only once in my life have I responded to a person the way I've responded to you, but I've forgotten when it was or even if it was in fact me that responded. I may not know much, but I know that the wind sings your name endlessly, although with a slight lisp that makes it difficult to understand if I'm standing near an air conditioner. I know that your hair sits atop your head as though it could sit nowhere else. I know that your figure would make a sculptor cast aside his tools, injuring his assistant who was looking out the window instead of paying attention. I know that your lips are as full as that sexy French model that I desperately want to fuck. I know that if for an instant I could have you lie next to me, or on top of me, or sit on me, or stand over me and shake, then I would be the happiest man in my pants. I know all of this, and yet you do not know me. Change your life; accept my love. Or, at least let me pay you to accept it."''  He leaves this note on her door and goes home. Once there, he sees a car parked in the driveway. It is Mrs. Munson, who has considered the offer and has left Fletcher. Korchek has to admit that he has fallen in love with someone else. Mrs. Munson is justifiably upset, and leaves.  The next day Korchek gets to work and is confronted by a large man who says "Your brother, eight hours, fifteen thousand dollars." In fact, almost all of this man's dialog consists of some combination of these three commands. Korchek goes into the office and finds a registered letter from a law firm representing Attractive Woman Number 2, who is filing a [[sexual harassment]] suit against Dr. Korchek.  The day goes from bad to worse when it is revealed that Korchek's brother has stolen all of his money. Broke, tired, loveless and depressed, Korchek leaves work, only to find that the large man's time limit has elapsed. Korchek is shot dead.  During this act, the couple following Elmo in the SUV approaches him to give up playing his role in the film (thus breaking the [[fourth wall]]) in order to become a star in his own action show. Contrary to the experience of the other characters, Elmo's storyline seems to move forward in time continuously, without rewinding/repeating between acts.  ===Act 3=== The final act is seen through the perspective of Mrs. Munson. We move through the storyline again and see her experience with Fletcher's growing disaffection, Dr. Korchek's affection, and the day-to-day routine of being a mom. The action follows roughly the same events, except that Fletcher and his doppelganger speak Japanese, Italian or French, with the cultural stereotype of each nationality reflecting Mrs Munson's perception of the men. This is in a similar vein to the "generic greetings" of the earlier act.  Once she leaves Korchek, she makes a tired reconciliation with Fletcher and they go home together. Fletcher finishes Schwitters' speech and all seems to be well.  The day of the speech, Schwitters mounts the podium and prepares to give the oration which is, by all accounts, quite good. After acknowledging applause with a "Thank you," Elmo, who has been missing for this entire act, bursts into the auditorium and shoots Schwitters in the shoulder. Schwitters survives and Elmo is arrested. After nonsensical ranting, repeating "nose army" again and again, Elmo exposes his crotch during a police interrogation. The police recoil and shield their eyes, implying that Lester Richards may have died the same way at beginning of the film after seeing photos of Elmo at the drugstore.  The movie ends with a pair of monologues. First, Munson is seen in a shopping mall narrating the events of the rest of his life &mdash; his wife will leave him in five years; in eight years, he will drunkenly collapse and fall asleep in a snowbank after a wedding reception in [[Alaska]] and be discovered and successfully thawed the following spring. Then, Soderbergh returns in front of a blank movie screen and asks if there are any questions. After offering several responses ("Yes." "Yes." "Foot-long veggie on wheat." "Thank you."), he walks offstage as the camera pulls back to reveal he's been talking to an empty auditorium.  ===Credits=== The film has no beginning or end credits. A man clad only in a black T-shirt appears at the beginning and conclusion of the film, shown to be chased by men in white coats over a green field. When he is first seen, the T-shirt sports the title of the film; in his later appearance, it says "The End."  There is a single frame of copyright information at the end of the film.  Cast

 Hortense Cumberbatch, a successful [[Black British|black]] middle class [[Optometry|optometrist]] in London who was adopted as a child, has chosen to trace her family history after the death of her adoptive mother. After being warned by public officials about the troubles she could face by tracking her birth mother down, she continues her investigation and is baffled to learn that her birth mother is not only white but does not resent her and wants to know more about her past.  Her birth mother, Cynthia Purley, is working class and downwardly mobile. Hortense meets her and later meets Cynthia's brother, Maurice Purley, a photographer, his wife Monica, and Cynthia's daughter Roxanne, a street cleaner.  At the Purleys', it is evident that severe tensions exist between Roxanne and her mother. Both are frustrated with one another and getting on one another's nerves. Maurice and Monica also experience domestic tensions. Monica comes across as abrupt, but later scenes reveal that she suffers from severe [[Dysmenorrhea|menstrual cramps]] and Monica makes concerted efforts to placate matters and be contrite. Things are also not well between Maurice and his sister, they are a bit awkward with one another but both look forward to celebrating Roxanne's birthday. Cynthia refers to Maurice affectionately as her little brother and asks him  as she always does when he is going to shave. It is clear that Cynthia somehow can survive by the money she receives from Maurice.  Hortense rings Cynthia and asks for a 'Cynthia Rose Purley', and starts talking about a baby called "Elizabeth Purley", born in 1968. Cynthia realizes that Hortense is her daughter whom she gave up for adoption and hangs up the phone. Hortense is still determined to find out more about her background. She rings Cynthia again and manages to convince her to meet with her. When they finally do, Cynthia feels that a grave mistake has been made. Hortense convinces Cynthia to have a cup of tea. Hortense asks Cynthia to look at a document; she then begins to cry and then states that she is ashamed. Hortense then wants to know who her father is, to which Cynthia refuses to answer.  After a while Hortense and Cynthia have struck up a friendship, which is somewhat noticed by Roxanne after seeing her mother going places but not knowing where, since Cynthia is rather secretive about it. Cynthia mentions the birthday party for Roxanne and also gives Hortense a gift. Cynthia asks Maurice if she can bring a "mate from work" to Roxanne's party. Cynthia relays this information to Hortense who replies that she would feel a bit awkward. Despite these feelings, she agrees to attend and pose as a colleague from work. The day of the barbecue arrives and Monica makes an effort for everyone to feel welcome. Cynthia makes incisive remarks in passing, but making sure that Monica hears them, about the seemingly high expenses that she makes in her house instead of concentrating on giving Maurice a child. Maurice tells Roxanne that she has a good brain and should be in college. Roxanne does not take this suggestion seriously. Everyone gathers for the barbecue and Maurice prepares the food. During the meal Hortense answers many questions which are naturally put to her by the other guests. Hortense says that she is pursuing medical research and endeavors to be evasive. Also present at the barbecue are Maurice's assistant Jane and Roxanne's boyfriend Paul.  When Roxanne blows out her birthday candles Cynthia begins to act in an exceptionally nervous manner. She states that Hortense is her daughter. Everyone dismisses this claim and states that she has had too much to drink. However, when Monica inadvertently confirms this as true, Roxanne is horrified and storms out of the house. Maurice attempts to placate matters by confronting Roxanne at a nearby bus stop. He attempts to convince Roxanne to speak to her mother again and Cynthia apologizes to her profusely. Cynthia then explains that she got pregnant at fifteen and her father sent her away due to feeling shame over her pregnancy and after the adoption she never expected Hortense to come back. Cynthia then accuses Monica of being selfish. Maurice reveals that Monica is physically incapable of having children. Maurice then loses his temper and states that he has spent his whole life trying to make people happy and that he cannot take it any more because the ones he loves most "hate each other's guts". After witnessing all this Hortense tries to leave but Maurice stops her, admiring her courage for trying to find her own past, although he will not reveal who her father was either. Cynthia then explains that Roxanne's father was an American medical student vacationing in Benidorm. One morning in Benidorm, Cynthia awoke and he had gone.  After a while things have calmed down and Hortense is free to visit Cynthia and Roxanne at their home. Hortense reveals that she always wanted a sister. Roxanne reveals that she would be happy to introduce Hortense as her half-sister notwithstanding the long explanations that it would entail. They gather for a visit at Cynthia's, and have tea.  
Set It Off (film)
 Francesca "Frankie" Sutton ([[Vivica A. Fox|Fox]]) is a [[Los Angeles]] bank teller who witnesses a robbery. Although she had no prior knowledge of the robbery, the bank fires Frankie after the police uncover a connection between her and one of the three robbers. Frankie goes to work at Luther's Janitorial Services with her three best friends, Lida "Stony" Newsom ([[Jada Pinkett Smith|Smith]]), Cleopatra "Cleo" Sims ([[Queen Latifah|Latifah]]), and Tisean "T.T." Williams ([[Kimberly Elise|Elise]]). Luther ([[Thomas Jefferson Byrd|Byrd]]) treats them with disrespect and pays them paltry wages. Cleo states that they should rob a bank themselves. Frankie agrees, but Stony and T.T. are reluctant. However, when Stony's younger brother is gunned down by the police in a case of mistaken identity and T.T.'s son is taken away from her by [[Social services|Child Protective Services]] because she cannot afford to take care of him, they too now have the motivation to join the robbery.  The four women embark on a series of bank robberies, which are investigated by [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Detective Strode ([[John C. McGinley|McGinley]]). He suspects that Cleo (because of her prior convictions), Frankie (because of her inadvertent connection to the earlier robbery and subsequent firing) and Stony (because of her brother's death) are involved. But his superior refuses to allow him to bring them in for questioning because he doesn't feel the evidence is sufficient. The four women stash the money in an air vent at one of their work sites. However, when Cleo, Frankie, and T.T. show up for work one day and find a new boss in charge, they quickly realize that Luther has discovered the money and fled with it. While Stony attends a banking event with her lover Keith Weston ([[Blair Underwood|Underwood]]), the three women track Luther to a motel, where he is sleeping with a prostitute and demand the return of their money. When Luther pulls a gun on Cleo, T.T. kills him in self-defense. The next day, Detective Strode takes Cleo to the police station to participate in a lineup. A glare from Cleo intimidates the prostitute into silence. Frankie and Cleo persuade T.T. and Stony that they need to rob another bank and leave town the next day.  The women rob the bank where Keith, Stony's lover, works. Strode and his partner ([[Ella Joyce|Joyce]]) try to prevent the robbery, but a bank security guard shoots T.T. A shootout ensues as Stony shoots the guard, and an enraged Cleo opens fire on the detectives. The women eventually drive away and as they proceed to switch getaway cars, T.T. succumbs to her wound and dies in Stony's arms. The three remaining women decide to split up and meet up later.  The police find Cleo who proceeds to lead them on a high speed chase. After her car is shot up by police, Cleo leaps from her car in one final battle for her dignity, firing her gun, and is shot down by the police. Frankie is found a short time later. Strode tries to get her to surrender, but when she runs away, she is shot in the back and killed. Stony tearfully watches this from a passing bus. Strode sees her from a distance but lets her go, realizing that he was the cause for all of this.   In Mexico, Stony mourns the losses of her friends and brother, and calls Keith to assure him that she is all right and thanks him. Keith hangs up the phone and smiles.

The Seventh Brother
 The story begins in the forest, with the viewer being addressed by Dr. Albert E. Owl, a "famous storyteller". Noting that the viewer is lost in the forest, he decides to recount the tale of Tiny the puppy, the seventh brother (occasionally interspersing his story with various comments of his own).  The doctor's tale begins the previous spring, with Tiny the puppy riding in a car with his owner-a little girl named Angie-and her grandpa after an enjoyable trip to a big city. On the way home, their car breaks down in the middle of a storm and the grandpa goes out to fix it. Angie goes out to help, telling Tiny to stay in the car, but leaving the door open. Spotting a frog outside, Tiny goes after it, but falls down a hill (unbeknownst to his owners, who drive off without him and can't hear his barks over the storm). Heartbroken, he decides to wait out the storm by sleeping in a little hollowed-out area in a bush (sleeping through Angie calling for him, as she noticed his absence soon and told her grandpa to go back to find him).  The next morning, a band of rabbits discover Tiny. Their opinions on him are mixed (most of them believe Tiny to be some form of monster), but the leader of the group-the ruffian of the family, J.C. (his real name is Jerald Cuthbert)-feels that he should be left to survive on his own; luckily, one of his sisters, Joanna, decides that they should help him. She quickly convinces her siblings to join up after putting the matter to a vote with the other rabbits- Rebecca (the eldest sister), Mimi (the sensitive one), Cody (the glutton), Marty (the cautious one) -and Tiny is welcomed into the family as a "bunny-puppy". Tiny accepts, but on one condition- they must come back later to see if Angie came back. The bunnies agree and bring him back to their home following a musical number in which they introduce themselves. However, they teach him to act like a rabbit, such as hopping and keeping his ears up straight. J.C. is frustrated with Tiny because he doesn't act like a rabbit, but when J.C. is caught by a hawk, Tiny scares the hawk away by barking at it, causing it to fly away in a panic. Because of this, the family afterwards decides to accept Tiny as their brother, which makes the puppy very happy, although their parents are afraid at first.  The morning after, Miss Magpie, the nosy leader of the forest, is very scared of the news and tells her friend, Birdie, and the whole forest about it. Most of the forest is scared of Tiny at first, but when they see that he isn't vicious, the animals are relieved. The sole exception for this rule is Miss Magpie, who is still heavily convinced that he is a monster. When Tiny smells the scent of his owners and hears Angie calling for him, he runs up the hill to the road where he first met the bunnies. But when he arrives, he is too late, and thinks that his owners don't want him anymore (luckily, his new family is able to turn his frown upside down). Miss Magpie hires a fox named Mr. Fox to try and intimidate the rabbits, but Tiny teaches them to growl at him, which scares Mr. Fox and sends him running. Human poachers arrive in the forest to try and kill the bunnies, but the puppy teaches the rabbits to howl while hiding in their home, which send the poachers running.   Later that night, a flood reaches the bunnies' home. J.C. and his father stay in their hole trying to dig their way out while the other rabbits climb up a branch, but Cody is caught in the raging waters and Tiny jumps in. The puppy saves Cody, and the rabbits hop onto dry land, but J.C. and their dad are still in their hole trying to dig through as the water rises. Tiny senses them and digs a hole where they escape. Their father applauds Tiny, saying he is proud for him to be their son.  Winter is not far from arrival, and Miss Magpie mocks Tiny for being a dog, not knowing how to prepare for winter. Unfortunately for her, fortunes turn when a ferret tries to kill her because she failed to stop the rabbits. The ferret bites Tiny's leg, but he eventually throws the ferret into a pond. Fearing for his safety, Miss Magpie warns the rabbits. When the rabbits discover that Tiny is alive, they celebrate. But he is sick due to the effects of the bite, and he is taken to see Dr. Owl, who tells the parents that he must be returned to his owners. The rabbits carry Tiny back home, but along the way, they come across a big crease between two hills. J.C. uses a large stick to successfully carry the family over the crease, and they finally reach his owners' home. As Tiny is dragged into his doghouse, the rabbits howl and then disappear, causing Angie to wonder if it's her puppy howling. When Angie sees Tiny, she and her grandpa are very happy to see him again and welcome him home.  
Shine (film)
 A man ([[Geoffrey Rush]]) wanders through a heavy rainstorm finding his way into a restaurant. The restaurant's employees try to determine if he needs help. Despite his manic mode of speech being difficult to understand, Sylvia learns that his name is David Helfgott and that he is staying at a local hotel. She returns him to the hotel, and despite his attempts to engage her with his musical knowledge and ownership of various musical scores, she leaves.  As a child, David (played by Alex Rafalowicz) is growing up in suburban [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] and competing in a local music competition. Helfgott has been taught to play by his father, Peter (played by [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]]), a man obsessed with winning who has no tolerance for failure or disobedience. David is noticed by Mr. Rosen, a local pianist who, after an initial conflict with Peter, takes over David's musical instruction.  As a teen, David (played by [[Noah Taylor]]) wins the state musical championship and is invited to study in America. Although plans are made to raise money to send David and his family is initially supportive, Peter eventually forbids David to leave and abuses him, thinking David leaving would destroy the family. Crushed, David continues to study and befriends local novelist and co-founder of the Communist Party of Australia, [[Katharine Susannah Prichard]] ([[Googie Withers]]). David's talent grows until he is offered a scholarship to the [[Royal College of Music]] in [[London]]. David's father again forbids him to go, but with the encouragement of Katharine, David leaves. In London, David studies under Dr. Cecil Parkes ([[John Gielgud]]) and enters a Concerto competition, choosing to play [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]]'s enormously demanding [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|3rd Concerto]], a piece he had attempted to learn as a young child to make his father proud. As David practices, he increasingly becomes [[Mania|manic]] in his behavior. David wins the competition, but suffers a mental breakdown and is admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where he receives [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electric shock therapy]].  David recovers to the point where he is able to return to Australia, but is still rejected by his father. David relapses and is readmitted to a mental institution as a young man. Years later, a volunteer at the institution recognizes David and knows of his musical talent. She takes him home but discovers that he is difficult to control, unintentionally destructive, and needs more care than she can offer. She leaves him at the hotel from earlier in the film. David has difficulty adjusting to life in broader society again, and often leaves the hotel to stimulate his interests. David wanders to the nearby restaurant.  The next day David returns to the restaurant, and the patrons are astounded by his ability to play the piano. One of the owners befriends David and looks after him. In return David plays at the restaurant. Through the owner David is introduced to Gillian ([[Lynn Redgrave]]). David and Gillian fall in love and marry. With Gillian's help and support, David is able to come to terms with his father's death and to stage a well-received comeback concert, presaging his return to professional music.  
Shall We Dance? (1996 film)
 The film begins with a close-up of the inscription above the stage in the ballroom of the [[Blackpool Tower]]: "Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear", from the poem ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]]. As the camera pans around the ballroom giving a view of the dancers, a voice-over explains that in Japan, ballroom dancing is treated with suspicion.  Shohei Sugiyama ([[Kōji Yakusho]]) is a successful ''[[salaryman]]'', with a house in the suburbs, a devoted wife, Masako (Hideko Hara), and a teenage daughter, Chikage (Ayano Nakamura). He works as an accountant for a firm in [[Tokyo]]. Despite these external signs of success, however, Sugiyama begins to feel as if his life has lost direction and meaning and falls into [[Depression (mood)|depression]].  One night, while coming home on the [[Seibu Ikebukuro Line]], he spots a beautiful woman with a melancholy expression looking out from a window in a dance studio. This is Mai Kishikawa ([[Tamiyo Kusakari]]), a well-known figure on the Western [[ballroom dance]] circuit. Sugiyama becomes infatuated with her and decides to take lessons in order to get to know her better.  Sugiyama's life changes once his classes begin. Rather than Mai, his teacher is Tamako Tamura ([[Reiko Kusamura]]), who becomes an important mentor to him. He meets his classmates: Tōkichi Hattori ([[Yu Tokui]]) who joined to impress his wife, and Masahiro Tanaka (Hiromasa Taguchi) who joined to lose weight. He also meets Toyoko Takahashi ([[Eriko Watanabe]]), another student. He further discovers that one of his colleagues from work Tomio Aoki ([[Takenaka Naoto|Naoto Takenaka]]) is a regular at the dance studio. Aoki, who is balding and mocked at work for his rigid ways, is revealed to be leading a secret life as a long-haired (via a wig) ballroom dancer. Though distant from her, the classes increase his infatuation for Mai. His secret thus becomes twofold: not only must he hide the lessons from his wife, he must also hide them from his friends and colleagues as it is considered embarrassing according to traditional [[Customs and etiquette of Japan|Japanese customs]] to participate in Western [[ballroom dance]].  Later, after being rebuffed by Mai, Sugiyama discovers to his surprise that his passion for ballroom dance outweighs his infatuation with her. Indeed, dancing, rather than Mai, gives Sugiyama the meaning in life that he was looking for.  Masako, noticing his odd behavior, thinks that he is having an affair — so she hires a private detective to follow him. Meanwhile, along with his classmates, Sugiyama enters an amateur competition – only to find out that his wife, having finally learned the truth from the detective (who has now become a devoted fan of ballroom dancing) is in the audience. Surprised by this, he stumbles and nearly knocks his dance partner to the floor. Though he is able to catch her, he accidentally rips the skirt of her dress off. Both leave the contest. Later, they learn that Tomio won the contest. When Tomio is ridiculed at work after his colleagues read of his success in the newspaper, Sugiyama stands up and tells them not to make fun of something they don't understand.  At home, Sugiyama's wife tries to understand her husband's new passion by asking him to teach her to dance as well. He is invited to a good-bye party for Mai, who is leaving for [[Blackpool]]. At the party, Mai joins him to dance, asking him "Shall we dance?"

His brother, Francis, is a Wall Street stock investor married to Renee, though she is frustrated by his lack of desire for sexual relations &ndash; not knowing that he is in a heated affair with Heather.  During weekends, Mickey and Francis visit their parents' home on Long Island. Their father, Frank, is locked in old-school, low-key, sexist ways, and is always telling Mickey and Francis what to do, yet also advises them to always go for what drives them to succeed.  Driving his cab, Mickey picks up Hope, an NYU art student headed to the airport. They click within seconds and she asks him to drive her to New Orleans. They become infatuated and impulsively marry the next day, returning to New York two days later to tell Francis and Renee. Francis is upset, mostly because he was not asked to be best man. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with her bohemian lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment. Francis grows concerned that he is being unfair to Heather by continuing to stay with Renee. At the same time, Renee's Italian-American family, mostly her younger sister Molly, suggest the problem with Francis' lack of interest in her is that he may be gay, so she asks Mickey and Frank to confront him. He denies being gay, but admits to being unfaithful.  Francis belittles Mickey for the lack of forward progress in his life with Hope. Francis also argues with Heather about her ongoing sexual relations with a wealthy old man referred to as "Papa". When Mickey picks up Heather as a fare, he goes up to her apartment to retrieve a television that belonged to him during their relationship. When she implies that he wants more than the TV from her, he does not reciprocate, instead chastizing her for the infidelity that ended their engagement and for her time as a call girl to pay her way through college. Throughout all this, Frank offers more egotistical advice to them&mdash;only to be devastated when he learns, during a fishing trip with his priest, that his usually religious wife has not been to Mass in months.  On a visit to Heather's apartment, Francis learns about her meeting with Mickey. Francis shows up at his brother's apartment to question him about whether or not Mickey had sex with her. Later, Mickey discovers that she is the woman with whom Francis is having the affair.

Francis finally confronts Renee with his affair and files for divorce. When Mickey finds out he intends to marry Heather, he informs Francis of Heather's time as a prostitute, causing Francis to get cold feet.  Hope informs Mickey that they will need to move to Paris in a month if she is accepted into an art school there. Mickey is already unsure about whether to join her when he meets Connie, Hope's co-worker at a neighborhood bar, who claims to have had a "special relationship" with Hope before the marriage. Mickey reacts poorly, leading Hope to tell him that she is unsure if he should come to Paris after all.  Due to Francis' sudden indecision over marriage, Heather decides to marry Papa. When Francis threatens to tell Papa that Heather was a prostitute, Heather tells Francis that Papa was "her best customer". He then calls Renee in hopes of getting back together with her, but she is already in a relationship with Scott Sherman, a family acquaintance whom Francis previously observed was a fatso geek, while Renee had pointed out that he was shy and sweet and nicer than Francis.  Mickey and Francis meet with Frank at his house, where their distraught father tells them that their mother left the previous day for a hardware store owner with whom she has been sleeping when supposedly at church. Frank apologizes to Mickey and Francis for giving them bad advice about life and love when his own wife was cheating. The three men decide to go out fishing, aware that despite the failure of their love lives, they will always have each other. As they prepare the motorboat to cast off, Mickey realizes he must try to talk with Hope before she leaves for Paris. Mickey is surprised to learn that Frank has arranged a special guest &ndash; Hope. Hope asks to drive the boat, but Frank, who never allowed a woman on his boat before, says it is too soon for that.  
Sgt. Bilko
  [[Master Sergeant]] Ernest G. Bilko is in charge of the motor pool at Fort Baxter, a small [[United States Army]] base that develops new military technology. Exploiting this position, he directs a number of scams, ranging from gambling to renting out military vehicles. His commanding officer, [[Colonel]] John Hall, overlooks Bilko's money-making schemes, as he is more concerned with problems in the hovertank that the base is designing.  [[Major]] Colin Thorn, an officer from the U.S. Army Inspector General's office, arrives at the camp and begins to scrutinize Bilko's record. Officially, Thorn is at Fort Baxter to conduct a general inspection and determine if the base should remain open in light of recent defense cutbacks. He is also determined to get revenge on Bilko to settle an old score the two have from [[Fort Dix]], where Thorn was nearly court-martialed after a fixed boxing match resulted in Thorn being shipped to [[Greenland]] in the belief that he was the one who tried to fix the fight.  Bitter and unprincipled, Thorn is not above breaking the law to ruin Bilko. He attempts to steal Bilko's long-time fiancée Rita, whom Bilko has stood up at the altar more than a dozen times. Rita is tired of waiting and gives Bilko 30 days to win her back or lose her for good.  Bilko, with the help of newly assigned Private First Class Wally Holbrook, devises a means of avoiding Thorn's attempt to transfer him to Greenland:  He rigs a demonstration of the base's malfunctioning hovertank, staged before a four-star general and numerous dignitaries. Since Thorn had deliberately tried to sabotage the tank the previous night, he confronts Bilko, Hall, and the general, loudly insulting Bilko and Hall. While ranting, he confesses to sabotaging the hovertank. Thorn is sent off again to Greenland.  The last day of Rita's ultimatum has come. Just as she sadly begins to write Bilko off forever, Rita hears men outside her house, serenading her with one of Bilko and her [[Only You (And You Alone)|favorite songs]]. Looking out, she sees Bilko and his platoon. Bilko asks Rita to marry him, and she accepts.

Silent Trigger
  The movie takes place in and around an unfinished city [[skyscraper]], the "Algonquin", where a sniper/spotter team (Waxman and Clegg) set up a firing platform on a top floor. The two arrive independently of each other, two of the Agency's assassins. As they meet, they recognize each other, as they have been on a mission together before.  This mission is portrayed in a series of flashbacks. In the first flashback, Waxman and Clegg were supposed to assassinate a female [[politician]]. Waxman hesitates when the politician lifts a child and, while hesitating, a [[helicopter]] appears, [[air assault]]ing [[soldier]]s in the courtyard behind the team's firing position. The two defeat the attacking force, including the machine gun-equipped helicopter, whose pilot and copilot are shot through the [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]].  Returning to the primary scene, one of the construction site security personnel is new on the job. The drug-addicted regular, O'Hara ([[Christopher Heyerdahl]]) attempts to win a statutory position over him by scaring him. As Waxman opens a roof door, a light by the security personnel turns on, and the newcomer, Klein ([[Conrad Dunn]]) leaves in search of it.  The internal lift of the building is clearly audible, and Clegg surveys Klein's movements, when he arrives. She interrupts his inspections when he is about to open the roof door. She takes him to the lift, sending him downwards. However, just as she is talking him off, she sees Waxman sitting on top of the lift car. He mounts a bomb on the lift car and, when the car begins moving, nearly falls down the shaft. He is saved by Clegg, and they both attempt keeping up the "just business"-facade, although some romantic appreciation is apparent.  While the two on the rooftop readjust their gear, O'Hara, presumably, decides to [[rape]] Clegg. However, Clegg pulls her small-caliber sidearm, and threatens O'Hara into the lift. When O'Hara returns downstairs, he picks up his gun and puts on [[body armor]]. He then surprises Clegg, while she is standing over the sink of the top-floor bathrooms. Clegg points her gun at him, and shoots a well-aimed bullet into his chest. Unsurprised by this, O'Hara attacks Clegg, but is encountered by Waxman, and a violent fight takes place in an unfinished hall between various building materials. The fight is won by Waxman, and he ties the now bloody O'Hara to a toilet.  Clegg and Waxman consummate their feelings for each other. Afterwards, as duty continues, Waxman heads for the bathrooms, but sees water running out under the door to the bathroom. He pulls his gun, and discovers that O'Hara has disappeared.  O'Hara bears the toilet with him down the stairs. A vengeful O'Hara grabs his shotgun and is about to go upstairs to finish off Waxman. Klein, the new security guard, shoots O'Hara with his shotgun, walks to the spot where the dying O'Hara lies and, in cold blood, puts a final shot into him.  Upstairs, the two are engaging the target. As before, Waxman hesitates and doesn't take the shot. As history repeats itself for the two, Clegg pulls her sidearm and implores Waxman to do his duty. Before the situation escalates, another shooter shoots the target four times and, when finished, takes aim for Clegg and Waxman. Waxman quickly throws himself and Clegg away from the shot, grabs his rifle and shoots the adversary. Waxman and Clegg defend themselves from [[Special police]] personnel raiding the skyscraper. Waxman and Clegg are surprised by Klein, who has stealthily entered the room. He shoots Waxman in the chest with his shotgun, but is threatened by Clegg who has picked up an [[MP5]] submachine gun. He takes the lift car and leaves when the planted bomb explodes.  Believing Waxman to be dead, Clegg flees the skyscraper. As she walks away from the building, the top of a nearby fire hydrant is shot off. She looks up, and sees Waxman throwing his [[sniper rifle]] from the building. Clegg walks away, smiling.

Sling Blade (film)
 Karl Childers is an [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] [[Arkansas]] man, who has been in the custody of the state [[mental hospital]] since the age of 12, for having killed his mother and her lover. Although he had been thoroughly [[Institutionalization (psychology)|institutionalized]], Karl is deemed fit to be released into the outside world. Prior to his release, he is interviewed by a local college newspaper reporter, and he recounts committing the murders with a [[Kaiser blade]], saying, "Some folks call it a sling blade. I call it a kaiser blade." Karl says he thought the man was raping his mother. When he discovered that his mother was a willing participant in the affair, he killed her too.  Thanks to the doctor in charge of his institutionalization, Karl, who is highly skilled at repairing small engines, lands a job at a repair shop in the small town where he was born and raised. He befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley, and shares some of the details of his past, including the killings. Frank reveals that his father was killed when he was hit by a train, leaving him and his mother on their own. He later admits that he lied, and that his father committed suicide.  Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda, and her gay friend, Vaughan Cunningham. Vaughan is the manager of the [[Variety store|dollar store]] where Linda works. Despite Vaughan's concerns about Karl's history in the mental hospital, Linda allows him to move into her garage, which angers Linda's abusive alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves. Karl bonds with Linda, who makes him biscuits to eat. Vaughan invites Karl to lunch where he explains that a gay man and a mentally challenged man face similar obstacles of intolerance, and ridicule, in small-town America, before warning Karl about Doyle's violent demeanor, as well as his fears that Doyle might hurt or kill Linda and Frank.  Karl quickly becomes a father figure to Frank, who misses his father, and despises Doyle, who becomes increasingly abusive towards everybody including his own friends. Eventually, Doyle, who is also the frontman of his own band, has a drunken outburst towards his fellow band members and kicks them out, and attempts to do the same with Karl and Vaughan. Linda tries kicking Doyle out of the house, despite his threats to kill her if she ever left him, and this leads to a physical confrontation with Linda and Frank, angering the boy, who throws things at Doyle until he finally leaves.  Karl is haunted by an incident that happened when he was 6 or 8 years old. His parents performed an abortion of his unwanted baby brother, causing the baby to "come out too soon," and Karl was given a bloody towel wrapped around the baby, which survived the abortion. Karl was instructed to "get rid of it," but when Karl detected movement inside the towel, he inspected it, discovering "a little ol' boy" that "wasn't no bigger than a squirrel." While recounting this story to Frank, Frank asks why Karl did not just keep the baby, to which Karl replies that he had no way to care for a baby. He placed the baby, still in the bloody towel, inside a shoe box and buried the baby alive, saying he felt it was better to just "return him to the good Lord right off the bat," because of the abuse and neglect he received at the hands of his own parents.  A few days later, Linda and Doyle reconcile, who announces his plan to move into the house permanently, and to one day "pop the question" to Linda, much to Frank's anger. After a lot of thinking, Karl visits his father, who has become a mentally unbalanced hermit, living in the dilapidated home where Karl grew up. He tells his father that killing his baby brother was wrong, and that he had wanted to kill his father for making him do it, but eventually decided that he was not worth the effort.  Knowing that he has the upper hand again, Doyle confronts Karl and Frank shortly after Karl's baptism, and announces "big changes" including Karl's removal from the house; Doyle attempts to attack Frank when he retorts him, which is stopped by Karl who threatens Doyle never to touch Frank again, to no avail. Karl begins to realize that, eventually, either Frank is going to kill Doyle and end up just like him, or that Doyle's abuse will end up killing Frank and Linda. In order to prevent this, Karl makes Frank promise to spend the night at Vaughan's house, and asks Vaughan to pick up Linda from work, and have her stay over also.  Karl returns to Linda's house, but seems undecided about whether to enter. When confronted, a drunk Doyle asks what Karl is doing with the lawnmower blade he had sharpened and fashioned into a weapon. Karl replies, "I aim to kill you with it," but not before asking how to reach the police by telephone. Not taking Karl seriously, Doyle says he should dial 911 and request "an ambulance, or a 'hearst'." Karl kills Doyle with two chopping blows of the lawnmower blade to the head. Karl then phones the police to turn himself in, and requests a "hearst" be sent for Doyle. He eats biscuits while waiting for the police.  Returned to the state hospital, he seems to be a different person than he was during his previous institutionalization, having learned the value of sacrificing one's self to save others. He silences a sexual predator who had previously forced him to listen to tales of his horrible deeds.  
Sleepers
  Lorenzo "Shakes" Carcaterra, Tommy Marcano, Michael Sullivan, and John Reilly are childhood friends in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] in the mid-1960s. The local priest, Father Robert "Bobby" Carillo, serves as a father figure to the boys and keeps an eye on them. However, they start running small errands for a local gangster, King Benny.  In the summer of 1967, they accidentally injure a man while pulling a prank on a hot dog vendor. The boys are sentenced to the Wilkinson Home for Boys in [[Upstate New York]]; Tommy, Michael, and John are sentenced to 12-18 months, while Shakes is given 6-12 months. There, the boys are systematically abused and raped by guards Sean Nokes, Henry Addison, Ralph Ferguson, and Adam Styler. The abuse changes the boys and their friendship forever.  During the boys' stay at the facility, they participate in Wilkinson's annual football game between the guards and inmates, one that the latter lose on purpose to avoid reprisals from the former. Michael convinces Rizzo, a black inmate, that they should play as hard as they can to show the guards they can fight back. Rizzo agrees, and helps to win the game. As a result of this, Shakes, Tommy, Michael, and John are all beaten and thrown into solitary confinement for several weeks, and the guards beat Rizzo to death.  By the spring of 1968, shortly before Shakes' release from Wilkinson, he insists that they should publicly report the abuse, but the others refuse, knowing that no one would believe them. They all therefore vow never to speak of the abuse the guards put them through once they are all out.  Thirteen years later, John and Tommy, now career criminals, encounter Nokes by chance in a Hell's Kitchen pub and kill him in front of witnesses. Michael, who has become an assistant district attorney, arranges to be assigned to the case, secretly intending to botch the prosecution. He and Shakes, who is a newspaper reporter, forge a plan to free John and Tommy and get revenge on the guards who abused them. With the help of others, including their childhood friend Carol and King Benny, they carry out their revenge using information compiled by Michael on the background of the former Wilkinson guards. They also hire Danny Snyder, a washed-up lawyer, to defend John and Tommy.  Michael's plan will only work if he can discredit Nokes and place John and Tommy at another location. Ferguson, when called in court as a witness for Nokes' character, is forced to admit that he, Nokes, and other guards abused boys. To clinch the case, however, they need a key witness who can give John and Tommy an alibi. Shakes has a long talk with Father Bobby, who first resists but eventually, after Shakes tells him of the abuse, agrees to commit perjury, saying that the accused were with him at a [[New York Knicks]] game at the time of the shooting. As a result, John and Tommy are acquitted.  The remaining guards are also punished for their crimes: Addison, a politician who still molests children, is killed by Little Caesar, a local drug kingpin and Rizzo's older brother; Styler, now a corrupt policeman, is arrested for taking bribes and murdering a drug dealer; and Ferguson, a social worker, loses his job and family and is plagued by guilt for the rest of his life.  Michael, Shakes, John, Tommy, and Carol meet at a bar to celebrate. Shakes remains a newspaper reporter, living in Hell's Kitchen. Michael quits the DA's office, moves to the English countryside, becomes a carpenter and never marries. John drinks himself to death and Tommy is murdered; both die before age 30. Carol stays in the city as a social worker and has a son, whom she names after the four boys.  
Small Faces (film)
  Glasgow, Scotland, 1968. Three teenage brothers – gang member Bobby, artistically-minded Alan and 13-year-old Lex – are growing up with their mother on the South Side of the city. Events which will have consequences for all concerned start to spiral out of control when Lex accidentally shoots Malky, the leader of the Garaside Tongs street gang, with an air gun.  
Skyscraper (1996 film)
 Carrie Wink ([[Anna Nicole Smith]]) is a beautiful and voluptuous helicopter pilot employed by Heliscort, a company that offers heli-taxi transport to high level clients. She is married to Gordon Wink ([[Richard Steinmetz]]), a detective with the LAPD, with whom we see some flashbacks of their relationship.  Fairfax ([[Charles M. Huber]]), a ruthless South African criminal mastermind prone to quoting [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], is intent on collecting a series of four interlocking electronic devices or circuits that can somehow "shift the balance of power in the world." Through deception and violence he has managed to acquire three of the devices.  Carrie, unbeknownst to her, has shuttled two of Fairfax’s goons to the site of one of their exchanges.  The location of the fourth device, tucked away in the [[Citigroup Center (Los Angeles)|Zitex building]], an 86-floor [[skyscraper]] in downtown Los Angeles, is the scene where most of the drama unfolds as Fairfax sets his sights on securing the last device.  Carrie is again called to pick up a pair of VIPs, who this time turn out to be Fairfax himself and his French assistant Jacques (Jonathan Fuller).  She takes them to the [[Citigroup Center (Los Angeles)|Zitex building]], where Fairfax has his band of terrorists take over the entire security system and liquidate the security guards as well appropriate an entire floor. Somehow there seems to be very few people in the 86-floor building.  He meets up with Cranston ([[Eugene Robert Glazer]]), the possessor of the fourth device. As with the previous three deliverers of the devices, Fairfax plans on killing him. Cranston is mortally wounded in a shootout.  Before entering the building, Cranston had suspected trouble, so his companion went in unseen.  Before he dies, Cranston escapes with the suitcase holding the device and meets up with Carrie, who helps him up to the roof. He gives her the suitcase and admonishes her to keep it away from Fairfax at all costs.  Carrie is hotly pursued over the roof by a muscular goon. With no way out but over the top, she jumps into a window washer's rig. She attaches herself to a steel winch cable and drops many floors down the side of the building at the speed of gravity until she is brought to a halt by the end of the cable.  Now, suspended and dangerously vulnerable to the gunman on the roof, who is shooting repetitively at her, she avoids being shot by constantly swinging around. Carrie finally crashes through a window just as the gunman destroys the winch with machine-gun fire, causing the cable to break free.  Carrie hides the suitcase in a trash trolley. She finds a young boy playing on his toy bike and protects him (the boy's mother has been shot previously; she was blonde and was mistaken for Carrie earlier). Carrie meets up with a small but comically gung-ho security guard and asks for his gun. Now armed, she proceeds back to the floor where she knows that hostages have been taken.  Carrie helps confuse the terrorist operating the surveillance cameras by lighting fires in the waste paper bins, causing the fire system to alert the LA fire brigade as well as disabling some monitors. Fairfax and his gunmen capture her and offer the freedom of the hostages for the location of the suitcase. Carrie witnesses a male hostage killed in cold blood by the female terrorist, after he attempts to exchange his own freedom for the $100,000 he has stolen from the building's computer accounts. Carrie reveals the location of the suitcase and is taken into a room by a guard with an obvious sexual intent.  Carrie's [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officer husband, Gordon ([[Richard Steinmetz]]), has been investigating the strange goings-on around town. He heads for Zitex (not knowing his wife is also there) and coincidentally stumbles upon his wife's mobile phone. Fearing for his wife’s safety, Gordon leads Fairfax’s men on a chase around the building. Carrie is fondled and almost raped by the guard, before stabbing him in the leg with a letter opener and shooting him dead.  Now she comes up behind Natasha the terrorist ([[Deirdre Imershein]]) and ruthlessly shoots her in the back, freeing the hostages. A previous flashback of Carrie shooting a handgun with her husband shows her to be an expert shot. This flashback also takes the liberty of showing her second sex scene; the first shows her naked in the shower and then in bed with her husband. Her other physical skills—in combat—are still to be revealed.  Gordon is being physically beaten up by a terrorist who is expert in hand-to-hand combat but is rescued by his wife. Fairfax finally finds the device, kills his right-hand man Jacques and heads for the roof, hoping to coerce Carrie at gunpoint into flying him out. He has not bargained on Gordon also being there (Gordon also has the young boy in tow). Gordon is shot in the shoulder. Carrie knocks the gun from his hand and engages Fairfax with swift kicks and punches which ends with Fairfax falling from the 86-story skyscraper to the street below.  The young boy is reunited with his blonde mother, who has not been killed after all, as an injured Carrie and her husband enter an ambulance.  
Skin & Bone (film)
 ''Skin & Bone'' is an episodic account of three [[Los Angeles]]-area hustlers, Harry, Billy and Dean, and Ghislaine, their [[pimp]]. Ghislaine (Nicole Dillenberg) constantly drives the streets of Los Angeles arranging client appointments. She relies on Harry (B. Wyatt), the most experienced member of her stable, to train new recruits, including Billy (Garett Scullin) and Dean (Alan Boyce).  Harry services both male and female clients and always acts as a [[Top and bottom in sex and BDSM#Top|top]]; many male clients hire him to beat them. He fantasizes about a woman ("Lovely Girl" <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Susannah Melvoin]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>) he once knew. He has convinced himself that he is not a prostitute but an "actor" providing "fantasies." In his unsuccessful pursuit of an acting career, Harry goes on a casting call for a cop movie. The casting director asks if he will do nudity, implying a [[casting couch]] scenario. Harry says he's an artist and loses the role.  Billy, though experienced, is still somewhat goofy and absent-minded. He sometimes helps Harry with scenes and Harry tries to convince him too that he is an actor and not a prostitute. On several occasions, Billy picks up men only to discover that the man is not actually his client. In one case he and the man fall in love and they plan to get Billy out of the business and start a life together. Shortly thereafter, Billy mistakes a man (Michael Haynes) for a client in a public restroom and that man stabs him to death.  Dean is Ghislaine's most recent recruit. While training him, Harry again tries to impart the notion that their job is just acting. Following his training and first successful trick (with a woman), Dean is humiliated when two women force him to start and stop masturbating seemingly at random. Dean then performs as a "nude cleaner" for a client. He learns that the client is an ex-Marine who was paralyzed in combat and still longs for the boy with whom he fell in love, who was killed. The client is still able to achieve an erection and Dean has sex with him.  Harry is at an appointment with a regular, a uniform fetishist called "The General" (Wynston A. Jones). Usually Harry beats him, but unknown to Harry, the client has arranged for something different with Ghislaine. After showing Harry a picture of himself in which he closely resembles Harry, the General orders Harry to strip. When Harry hesitates, the General attacks him from behind, binds his hands with tape and rapes him.  Harry asks his acting agent to set up an "interview" with another casting director. He lets the man fuck him. Later at Dean's place, Harry finds Dean sitting alone burning himself with a cigarette. Dean tells Harry he ran away from home after his father had him arrested at age 14 for stealing a candy bar. Dean was put in a cell with several men who took turns raping him.  After allowing himself to be used by the casting director, Harry gets a small role as a cop in the film for which he had previously been rejected. On-set he impresses the producers and they offer him a part in a TV series.  Ghislaine sends Harry to the local morgue with $2,500 to bribe an attendant ([[James Michael White]]). Harry sees Billy's body and realizes that Ghislaine is acquiring it for a client. He confronts Ghislaine, accusing her of arranging Billy's murder, and tells her he wants to quit and take Dean with him. Ghislaine agrees, if Harry and Dean perform one final scene.  The scene is a cop/prisoner scenario which begins with the cop beating the prisoner then the prisoner overpowering the cop, binding and beating and finally shooting him. Harry plays the cop and Dean the prisoner. Bound and gagged, Harry sees Ghislaine switching his gun (loaded with blanks) for another gun, but fails to convey the danger to Dean. As Ghislaine and the client watch and the client tapes the scene, Dean pulls the trigger and kills Harry. Harry meets "Lovely Girl," who asks him how he feels being dead.  Six months later, Dean is living on the streets. Ghislaine finds him and convinces him to return to work.  
Slayers Return
 Young sorceresses [[Lina Inverse]] and [[Naga the Serpent]] travel across the world in search of adventure and money, bickering with each other along the way. They meet a girl named Saleena, who seems to be a random victim of the result of their petty food fight that ended with a powerful spell explosion. Truth is she has been already injured since when she escaped from her village of Biaz, where the evil organization Zein enslaved the population. The usually selfish Lina inexplicably agrees to help them: she has heard about an ancient elven treasure made of the nearly indestructible magical metal of [[orihalcon]] and she would like to put her hands on it. Because of Lina's suspicious behavior, the equally greedy Naga decides to follow them.  Once in Biaz, the two ask for a reward for saving it but the village chief and Saleena's father is not able to give them a reward high enough, so Naga takes and puts on an orihalcon bracelet she finds there. Lina and Naga embark to defeat the Zein megalomaniac leader Galev and discover is a fluke as his wizard powers are mostly a bluff, and his organization currently consists of just himself and his sole underling Zahhard. The girls and Saleena confront Galev's arriving collection of henchmen but they want to get Galev themselves because he did not pay their promised salary. Turns out that Galev planned to take hold of a long-lost legendary superweapon that find out about in an old magic book and, if he was able to take possession of it, conquer and rule to world.  When the weapon is unearthed, what Lina thought would immense treasure turns out to be a massive [[golem]] made whole of orihalcon. Naga's bracelet is its control device but she can not either control it properly or take it off. The golem attacks them all and a chase and running battle begins, in which everyone join the forces to defeat the golem and the mini-golems it spawns. To solve destroy the crazed golem, Lina asks Naga to create one of her golems and surround it with a barrier, so Lina can cast a destructive Dragon Slave spell and send the second golem right against the first, finally defeating it but ruining all the orihalcon. The film ends with the girls and Biaz's people running after Galev, because he did not only take money from them and spent for useless fancy costumes for his organization, but now it was also impossible for the chief to pay Lina and Naga.

He is sent to [[Central America]] by General Haynes ([[Barry Corbin]]) to battle [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] insurgents, but a flaw develops in his programming and he develops a conscience and compassion. His developers try to take him back for deprogramming, but he flees to the [[jungle]] in a helicopter. His main energy supply was damaged during the first mission, forcing him to switch to his much less powerful secondary power.

The MkII kills Madden and proceeds to hunt down Solo. Solo is able to save the villagers and beat the MkII android, using his acquired bluffing skills. After the temple the two androids fought in collapses, causing the military to pull out believing both units are destroyed and unrecoverable, Miguel, Solo's companion, mourns Solo believing he was destroyed by cave-in, but Miguel starts to hear Solo, laughing, as he knows he has earned his freedom.  
Snowboard Academy
 A competition is held between two brothers on their father's ski slopes; one is a skier, the other a snowboarder. The competition would determine if snowboarders could be allowed to be a part the ski patrol. Into the scene arrives Rudy James, played by Jim Varney<ref>[[Jim Varney]]</ref> who stumbles his way into a job as ski patrol, entertainment host, and jack of all trades. What was cut out of the film was that Rudy James was hired by Mimi, played by Brigitte Nielsen<ref>[[Brigitte Nielsen]]</ref>, to ineptly sabotage the ski hill so that she could win it in a divorce proceeding. The two brothers discover her plot to damage their father's ski hill (played by SCTV's [[Joe Flaherty]]) and further hilarity ensues.  While nearly uncommon today, there was a time when snowboarding was banned from many worldclass resorts, resulting in the concept of [[poaching (snowboarding)|poaching]]. Writer/producer, [[Rudy Rupak]], who was an avid skier trying to learn how to snowboard, seized upon this interesting concept to mine it for its subversive comedic value. Subsequently though Columbia Pictures removed all references to poaching from the script.

The Snow Queen contacts Ellie, telling her that she has captured Dimly and daring her to rescue him. Ellie does not know where the Queen is now, so Peeps takes her to Brenda, a bird that is said to know everything. Meanwhile, the Queen reaches her palace set on a frozen volcano and locks Dimly away in a cell next to her ferocious reindeer, which attempt to break into his cell and eat him. Brenda takes Ellie and Peeps toward the South Pole. They stop at a restaurant for food, where the proprietor (a greedy humanoid pig) and her minions capture Brenda and try to cook her to serve as food. Ellie and Peeps stop them and escape, destroying the restaurant.  The Snow Queen begins work on the final part of her plan, creating the Iceosaurus, an ice pterodactyl. Meanwhile, Ellie falls asleep and she and Peeps fall off Brenda and into the ocean, where they are picked up by a humanoid walrus, Clive and his partner Rowena, on a ship named the S.S. ''Quagmire''. When Ellie and Peeps describe how they are on their way to the Queen's palace, they realize that she set the whole thing up to lure Ellie there. Clive and Rowena are revealed to be bounty hunters who plan to give Ellie to the Queen for a big reward, and imprison her and Peeps. When Brenda realizes that they have fallen off, she comes back and rescues them.  Brenda, Ellie, and Peeps arrive at the South Pole, but the Iceosaurus freezes Brenda. Ellie and Peeps discover a magic talisman that turns into a salt shaker which Ellie uses to unfreeze Brenda. Brenda separates from Ellie to find a high place to take off. Ellie and Peeps encounter Pearl and Elspeth, two humanoid penguins who clean the palace for the Snow Queen, and Ellie traps them inside a bubble using the device. They find Dimly and release him from his cell by turning the device into a key, and locking the Queen's reindeer inside. The group attempts to escape, but Dimly is too weak to fly at the moment. The Queen and the Iceosaurus attack them, but Freda's device turns into a kind of shield that Ellie uses to deflect the ice beams the Queen shoots at her, causing one to hit the Iceosaurus. It falls and crashes into the ground, creating a massive volcanic eruption. Brenda escapes the flood of lava and gets Ellie, Peeps, and Dimly to safety. The panicked Snow Queen attempts to flee on feet, but is unable to escape her crumbling palace and falls down into the lava.  As Brenda takes Ellie, Peeps, and Dimly back home, Eric, Baggy, Wardrobe, Pearl, and Elspeth watch as the Snow Queen's castle is destroyed, and walk off once the eruption is over. The final scene shows the Queen drifting through the river of molten magma, her body semingly intact but now turned to stone, and still holding her magic staff. Her eyes glow onimously before the credits roll.  Songs:<br> Cooperation; Queen Of Cold; Penguins Of The Palace; She Is Your Bird; Cooking The Masterpiece; S.S. Quagmire;  
Small Time
 The film follows a group of friends that are small-time criminals in [[Sneinton]], a suburb of [[Nottingham]].  The main protagonists are best friends, Jumbo and Malc.  At the beginning of the film we hear Jumbo narrating, "We're not into anything heavy.  We just rob from the rich and sell it to the poor for half price.  We're just small time."  Malc and his partner Kate live next door to Jumbo and his partner Ruby.  Malc and Kate can continually hear the domestic abuse in the neighbouring house,  but Ruby is quick to defend Jumbo although she does concede that he is bad in bed and tells Kate that she uses a sex aid.  Malc is unhappy with the way his life is going but cannot seem to find a way out of the situation.  Kate is unhappy too and pushes Malc to sever ties with the group.  Kate attends a yoga class and makes friends with a classmate, Martin, who invites Kate and Malc to his house for the evening.   Kate, Malc, Martin and his girlfriend, Elaine are having a good evening until Jumbo turns up uninvited having found out where they were from their babysitter.  Malc makes it clear that he doesn't want Jumbo there.  Jumbo later relays this tale to the rest of the gang, who are not impressed with Malc's new attitude.  They decide to be nice to him until they have completed an armed robbery, which they need him for, and then cut him out of their circle of friends.  Malc is uncomfortable with the robbery but goes along anyway.  They raid a small new age store that sells incense, charms and the like.  Malc acts as a look out on the street with Terry, who is driving the getaway van.  Whilst the raid is going on, Malc convinces Terry to drive off.  Jumbo and the rest of the gang realise that there is no money on the premise they leave when they hear police sirens, but there is now no getaway van so they have to make a run for it.  Meanwhile, Malc has taken the van and is doing a moonlight flit - in broad daylight - with his family.  The film ends with Jumbo being apprehended with by the police.  As the credits roll we see what's happened to the gang; Willy, Jumbo and Bets are in prison, Lenny gets his comeuppance for his dodgy deals, Mad Terry looking after Malc and Kate's children in Skegness, where they now live.  Kate and Malc now run a refreshment hut by the sea.

Space Jam
 On a summer night in 1973, a young [[Michael Jordan]] is practicing [[basketball]]. [[James R. Jordan Sr.|His father]] steps out and tells him it is bedtime, but lets him make a few more shots. Jordan shoots while making several wishes like going to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], playing on a championship team, joining the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], going on to play baseball, and successfully scores every shot. Impressed, Jordan's father jokingly asks if next he is going to wish he could fly, and Jordan turns to make one final shot.  In 1993, Jordan announces his retirement from professional basketball to follow his now deceased father's career as a [[baseball]] player. However, it becomes evident that he is not as skilled in baseball as he was in basketball. Jordan is assigned a publicist and assistant, the bumbling Stan Podolak, to make his new career less bumpy.  Elsewhere, in outer space, an intergalactic [[amusement park]] called Moron Mountain faces dwindling popularity, so its owner, Mr. Swackhammer, sends his diminutive minions, the Nerdlucks, to capture the [[Looney Tunes]] as new entertainment. The Looney Tunes live in an animated world called ''"Looney Tunes Land"'' hidden in the center of the Earth, but ignore the Nerdlucks' threats and challenge them to a game of basketball.  The Nerdlucks steal the talents of professional basketball players [[Charles Barkley]], [[Shawn Bradley]], [[Patrick Ewing]], [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] and [[Muggsy Bogues]], leaving them incapable of playing. The Nerdlucks absorb the talent, transforming into the gigantic ''"Monstars"'' who easily intimidate the Looney Tunes. While playing [[golf]] with [[Bill Murray]], [[Larry Bird]] and Stan, Jordan is sucked down a hole and is recruited by [[Bugs Bunny]] to help the Tunes win against the Monstars. Jordan at first refuses, saying he does not play basketball anymore, but changes his decision after he is insulted and humiliated by the Monstars when they squash him into the shape of a basketball and bounce him around like one. He then sends Bugs and [[Daffy Duck]] to his house to retrieve his basketball gear.  Meanwhile, Stan has been digging out the golf hole to find Jordan, but spots Bugs and Daffy leaping down another one and pursues them, reuniting with Jordan in the Tunes' world and joins their team, the Tune Squad. Another new recruit is [[Lola Bunny]], a skilled basketball player whom Bugs falls in love with. On the day of the match, the Monstars dominate the first half, leaving the Looney Tunes unconfident. Stan overhears a conversation between the Monstars and Swackhammer, learning of how they gained their talent and informs Jordan and the Tune Squad. Bugs and Jordan convince the rest of the Tune Squad to fight back and the first quarter of the second half allows the Tunes to catch up using old school gags and [[Acme Corporation|Acme weaponry]]. During a timeout, Jordan raises the stakes of the game with Swackhammer: a win by the Tune Squad would require the Monstars to give their  stolen talents back to the NBA players, while a Monstars win would get Jordan as a new attraction.  To ensure his victory, Swackhammer has the Monstars play rough and injure all of the Tune Squad until only Jordan, Bugs, Daffy, Lola and Stan are left. Stan becomes the fifth player and manages to score, but is literally flattened by the Monstars and is removed from the court to be inflated. The referee, [[Marvin the Martian]], informs Jordan that unless the team gets a fifth player, they will have to forfeit the game, at which point Murray appears and volunteers to be the team's fifth member. In the final seconds of the game, Jordan gains the ball and manages to use [[cartoon physics]] to extend his arm and score the winning points. Murray retires from the sport and the Monstars blast Swackhammer to the Moon in a rocket when Jordan makes them realize that, since they are not bigger than him than he was before, they do not have to take his abuse anymore. Jordan convinces them to give up the stolen talents, and the Looney Tunes agree to recruit the reformed Nerdlucks in their ensemble. Jordan and a recovered Stan return to the surface, the Nerdlucks dropping them off at Jordan's next baseball game. Later on, the two visit the incapacitated basketball players and return their talent. The players invite Jordan to a three-on-three match, but when he declines, they question his loss of talent. Jordan later returns to the [[Chicago Bulls]] to resume his basketball career.  
Space Truckers
 At a corporation's base on the [[Neptune|Neptunian]] moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], mercenaries are setting up a defense perimeter to try to hold off an unstoppable [[cyborg]] warrior. The commander Saggs and scientist Nabel, seal themselves inside the control room. The cyborg destroys the soldiers' tank and then attacks a helicopter—which crashes into the control room. The soldiers are killed one by one, until Nabel finally deactivates the cyborg with a remote control. The remaining corporate employees discover that the cyborg was created by Nabel for company owner E.J. Saggs. Saggs takes the remote from Nabel. He reactivates the cyborg and orders it to kill Nabel.  Meanwhile, John Canyon, one of the last independent "space truckers", drops off his cargo of square pigs at a "truck stop" space station, but becomes embroiled in a brawl with the trucking company head, Keller, who is sucked out into space. He and his two passengers—Cindy, a waitress who has promised to marry him in exchange for a ride to Earth to see her mother, and Mike, an up-and-coming trucker working for the company—take on a deal to transport alleged [[sex doll]]s to Earth. Chased by police investigating Keller's death, John takes his rig into the "scum zone", a region controlled by pirates. The rig takes damage, leaving them adrift; they are soon captured by the pirate ship ''Regalia'', commanded by the company-hating Captain [[Macanudo (cigar)|Macanudo]]. Cindy agrees to have sex with him if he would take the cargo and let them go.  The captain is revealed to be Nabel, who rebuilt his grievously-injured body and went into piracy as revenge against Saggs for betraying him. The cargo that John's rig is carrying is in fact a full supply of the cyborg warriors Nabel designed and built for Saggs' company. One of the cyborgs comes alive, kills most of the crew, and severely damages the ship. John, Cindy and Mike take their rig and escape as the ''Regalia'' explodes. As they make their way back to Earth, John and Mike find a mortally-wounded Macanudo in the hold, who reveals the true nature of the cargo to them. John releases Cindy from any obligation of marrying him, and tells her and Mike to take the [[escape pod]] while he releases the cargo in the atmosphere, where it will burn up on re-entry. Cindy and Mike land safely, but the rig is unable to return to space and explodes in the sky; however, John is able to safely escape before the explosion.  John, Cindy and Mike go to the hospital to see Cindy's mother, who became sick twenty years earlier and was [[suspended animation|frozen]] until a cure was found; John is smitten with her at first sight. Meanwhile, Saggs—now President of Earth after the government was privatized—visits John, Cindy and Mike in the hospital, where he offers John a new rig and gives the trio a suitcase full of money to keep them quiet about his cyborg invasion plan. John agrees to the deal, but Mike angrily throws the suitcase out the window. Below, Saggs re-enters his presidential limousine; having planted a bomb in the suitcase, he triggers the detonator just as the suitcase lands on his limousine's roof, killing him. With Saggs dead and Earth safe, Mike, Cindy, John and Cindy's mother blast off in their brand new rig.  
Space Marines (film)
 In the future, [[colonization of space|space has been colonized]]. As humanity expanded, the Marine Corps became the Space Force. Col. Fraser (John Pyper-Ferguson), a former Marine officer who has become a pirate, has his pirates hijack a new synthetic explosive. Light and concealable, it is the perfect [[improvised explosive device]]. He takes hostages at a local colony to draw out an Earth negotiator (James Shigeta), who is escorted by a Marine [[fire team]] under the command of Capt. Gray (Edward Albert). He then takes him hostage on his ship, as well as the Sgt. in charge of the [[security detail]]. After a short space chase, he arrives with demands for gold in exchange for the negotiator's life. Col. Fraser is killed by a new recruit, who shoots him through his own torso, killing them both in the process.  
Star Trek: First Contact
 It is the 24th century. Captain [[Jean Luc Picard]] awakens from a nightmare in which he relived his assimilation by the cybernetic [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] six years earlier. He is contacted by Admiral Hayes, who informs him of a new Borg threat against Earth. Picard's orders are for his ship, the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|USS ''Enterprise''-E]], to patrol the Neutral Zone in case of [[Romulan]] aggression; Starfleet is worried that Picard is too emotionally involved with the Borg to join the fight. Learning the fleet is losing the battle, the ''Enterprise'' crew disobeys orders and heads for Earth, where a single Borg Cube ship holds its own against a group of Starfleet vessels. The ''Enterprise'' arrives in time to assist the crew of the [[USS Defiant|USS ''Defiant'']] and its captain, the [[Klingon]] [[Worf]]. Picard takes control of the fleet and directs the surviving ships to concentrate their firepower on a seemingly unimportant point on the Borg ship.<ref name="nemecek-326">Nemecek, 326.</ref> The Cube is destroyed after launching a smaller sphere ship towards the planet.

After destroying the Borg sphere, an away team transports down to Cochrane's ship, the ''Phoenix'', in Montana. Picard has Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane sent back to the ''Enterprise'' for medical attention. The Captain returns to the ship and leaves Commander [[William T. Riker]] on Earth to make sure the ''Phoenix''s flight proceeds as planned.<ref name="nemecek-327">Nemecek, 327.</ref> While in the future Cochrane is seen as a hero, the real man is reluctant to assume the role the ''Enterprise'' crew describe.<ref name="startrek-synopsis"/>  A group of Borg invade the ''Enterprise''s lower decks and begin to assimilate its crew and modify the ship.

A frightened Sloane corners Picard with a weapon, but he gains her trust. The two escape the Borg-infested area of the ship by creating a diversion in the [[holodeck]].<ref name="nemecek-327"/> Picard, Worf, and the ship's navigator, Lt. Hawk, travel outside the ship in space suits to stop the Borg from calling reinforcements by using the deflector dish.

Spy Hard
 Secret agent [[WD-40]] Dick Steele ([[Leslie Nielsen]]) has his work cut out for him. Along with the mysterious and lovely Veronique Ukrinsky, Agent [[Pi|3.14]] ([[Nicollette Sheridan]]), he must rescue the kidnapped Barbara Dahl and stop the evil genius, a General named Rancor ([[Andy Griffith]]), from seizing control of the entire world.  Rancor was wounded in an earlier encounter and no longer has arms. However, he can "arm" himself by attaching robotic limbs with various weapons attached. Steele is talked out of retirement by an old friend, agent Steven Bishop ([[Robert Guillaume]]), and given his new assignment by The Director ([[Charles Durning]]), who also is testing out a variety of elaborate disguises. At headquarters, Steele encounters an old agency nemesis, Norm Coleman ([[Barry Bostwick]]), and flirts with the Director's adoring secretary, referred to as Miss Cheevus ([[Marcia Gay Harden]]).  On the job, Steele is assisted by an agent named Kabul ([[John Ales]]), who gives him rides in a never-ending variety of specially designed cars. They seek help from McLuckey ([[Mason Gamble]]), a blond child left [[Home Alone|home alone]], who is very good at fending off intruders. Steele resists the temptations of a dangerous woman ([[Talisa Soto]]) he finds waiting for him in bed. But he does work very closely with Agent 3.14, whose father, Professor Ukrinsky ([[Elya Baskin]]), is also being held captive by Rancor.  Everything comes to an explosive conclusion at the General's remote fortress, where Steele rescues both Barbara Dahl ([[Stephanie Romanov]]) and Miss Cheevus and launches a literally disarmed Rancor into outer space, saving mankind.  
The Spitfire Grill
  The story centers on a young woman named Percy (Alison Elliott) who was recently released from prison. She arrives in a small town in Maine with hopes of beginning a new life. She lands a job as a waitress in the Spitfire Grill, owned by Hannah (Ellen Burstyn), whose gruff exterior conceals a kind heart and little tolerance for the grill's regular customers who are suspicious of Percy's mysterious past. None is more suspicious than Nahum, Hannah's nephew, although his wife, Shelby, has a kinder curiosity.  When Hannah is bedridden after a nasty fall, Percy and Shelby pitch in to save the Grill and win the approval of Hannah, who learns she does need friends.  Joe, an attractive young man in town, becomes smitten with Percy. He is approached by a scientist who thinks that the town's trees might have medicinal benefits.  As the plot unfolds, Hannah holds a $100-per-entry essay contest to find a new owner for the grill. This creates a positive change in the town, but the plans are disrupted by Nahum's suspicions about Percy and the revelation that a local hermit is Hannah's shell-shocked, Vietnam veteran son.  Percy sacrifices her own life to save Hannah's son and prompts a number of the town's citizens to examine their own conduct more deeply.  Overall, the film deals with powerful themes of redemption, hatred, compassion, independence, the economic problems of small towns, the plight of [[Vietnam War]] veterans, and, to some extent female empowerment.  The film somewhat misleads the audience into thinking that it will be Percy who finds redemption, but it is other characters and relationships, and indeed the town itself, that are powerfully redeemed through Percy's actions.

That trauma is intensified when Anna begins to receive phone calls from the supposedly-dead Alfredo. When Marie is found murdered, Anna's psychologist, concerned about her mental state, visits her at home. While he is there, a colleague of Anna's, Marco, calls to notify her that Alfredo's body has in fact been found. This leads to the psychologist realizing the truth, and he confronts Anna with the reality that she herself is Marie's murderer. Marco arrives at Anna's apartment, only to find that she has killed her psychologist as well. As he attempts to take Anna's gun from her, she confesses that Alfredo is now inside her, ordering her to do terrible things, whereupon she murders Marco. The police arrive on the scene and ultimately arrest her after she wanders the streets.  
Stealing Beauty
 Lucy Harmon, a nineteen-year-old American, is the daughter of well-known (now deceased) poet and model, Sara Harmon. The film opens as Lucy arrives for a vacation at the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] villa of Sara's old friends, Ian and Diana Grayson (played by [[Donal McCann]] and Cusack, respectively). Other guests include a prominent New York art gallery owner, an Italian advice columnist and an English writer, Alex Parrish (Irons), who is dying of an unspecified disease. Lucy goes for a swim, and finds that Diana's daughter from a previous marriage, Miranda Fox (Weisz), is also there with her boyfriend, entertainment lawyer Richard Reed ([[D. W. Moffett]]). Miranda's brother, Christopher (Fiennes), is supposed to be there, but he is off on a road trip with the Italian son of a neighboring villa, Niccoló Donati (Roberto Zibetti). Lucy was particularly hoping to see Niccoló, whom she had met on a previous visit to the villa, four years earlier, and who was the first boy she'd ever kissed. Lucy and Niccoló had briefly exchanged letters after this first visit. One letter in particular Lucy had admired so much she memorized it.  Lucy reveals to the gallerist that she is there to have her portrait made by Ian, who is a sculptor. She says it's really just an excuse for her father to send her to Italy, "as a present." Smoking marijuana with Parrish, Lucy reveals that she is a virgin. When Parrish shares this information with the rest of the villa the next day, Lucy is furious and decides to cut her visit short. While she is on the telephone booking a flight to New York, however, Christopher and Niccoló return from their road trip, and Lucy is once again happy, although she is disappointed that Niccoló did not immediately recognize her.  That evening, Niccoló comes to the Grayson villa for dinner, accompanied by his brother, Osvaldo (Ignazio Oliva). After dinner, the young people separate from the adults to smoke marijuana. Lucy is now able to laugh about Parrish's betrayal, and the group take turns recounting when they each lost their virginity. When the question comes around to Osvaldo, he demurs, saying, "I don't know which is more ridiculous, this conversation or the silly political one going on over there [at the grown-ups' table]." Lucy fawns over Niccoló but abruptly vomits in his lap.  The next day Lucy rides a bicycle to the Donati villa, looking for Niccoló. A servant informs her that he is in the garden, where Lucy finds him kissing another girl. Hastily bicycling away from the compound, she passes Osvaldo, who has been hunting with his dog. As she passes, Osvaldo holds up a jackrabbit he has killed and cries, "Ciao, Lucy!" Lucy doesn't stop but loses control of the bicycle at the next turn. Osvaldo tries to help but Lucy rebuffs his efforts and rides on.  The next day, Lucy poses outdoors for Ian's sketch studies, at one point exposing one of her breasts. Niccoló and Osvaldo arrive in a car. Niccoló ogles Lucy, but Osvaldo looks away, decrying Lucy's lack of propriety. Ian dismisses Lucy, who wanders off into an adjacent olive grove, followed by Niccoló. They begin to make out, but Lucy eventually pushes him away.  Retreating to the guest house, Lucy shares her notebook with Parrish. Up to this point, the viewer has been led to believe that this notebook contains Lucy's writings. Now it is made clear that this is one of Sara Harmon's last notebooks. It contains an enigmatic poem that Lucy thinks holds clues to the identity of her real father. Throughout the film, she has been asking probing questions about her mother. Did Parrish ever know Sara to wear green sandals? Had Ian ever eaten grape leaves? Had Carlo Lisca (a war correspondent friend of the Graysons whom Sara had known) ever killed a viper? All of these images are found in the poem, which Lucy now reads to Parrish. Lucy and Parrish agree that the poem must refer to Lucy's real father.  That evening, Lucy wears her mother's dress to the Donati's annual party. Almost immediately after arriving, Lucy sees Niccoló with another girl and the two do not speak. Lucy sees Osvaldo playing clarinet in the band that is providing musical entertainment. She later sees Osvaldo dancing with a girl, but they exchange earnest glances. Lucy picks up a young Englishman to take back to the Grayson's villa. On the way out, Osvaldo chases Lucy down and says that he's interested in visiting America and would like advice. They agree to meet the next day. Lucy leaves with the Englishman, who spends the night at the Grayson's villa but without having sex with Lucy.  The next day, Parrish's health takes a turn for the worse, and he is taken to the hospital. After the ambulance goes, Lucy skulks around Parrish's quarters in the guest house. Looking out one of his windows, she sees one of Ian's sculptures of a mother and child. The expression on her face suggests that she has had an epiphany. She goes to Ian's studio and asks him where he was in August 1975, when she was conceived. Ian says he was here, fixing up the villa. He says he thinks that might have been when Lucy's mother was at the villa, having her own portrait made. Lucy says, "That's what I thought." Ian says they could ask Diana, but then he remembers that Diana was back in London at the time, finalizing her divorce. Without explicitly saying so, the two appear to acknowledge that Ian is Lucy's biological father, and Lucy promises to keep the secret.  In the meantime, Osvaldo has arrived at the villa. When Lucy exits Ian's studio, she is stung by a bee. Osvaldo rescues her and takes her to a brook, giving her wet clay for her stings. As they walk through the countryside, Osvaldo confesses that he wrote to Lucy once, pretending to be Niccoló. This letter turns out to be the letter that Lucy loved above all the others, the letter which she memorized. Lucy can't believe it, but Osvaldo recites part of the letter and takes Lucy to a tree he had described in the letter as "my tree".  Lucy and Osvaldo spend the night under the tree, where Lucy finally loses her virginity. As they part the next morning, Osvaldo reveals that it was his first time, too.

The Substitute
 Jonathan Shale (Berenger) is a [[mercenary]] and a [[Vietnam veteran]] who returns home to [[Miami]] after a botched covert operation in [[Cuba]] in which three men from his platoon were killed. He surprises his girlfriend, Jane Hetzko ([[Diane Venora]]) at her apartment and is warmly welcomed. On the outside, Hetzko is a schoolteacher at inner-city Columbus High School, an institution with a considerable gang problem. She is particularly disliked by Juan Lacas (Anthony), leader of the KOD ("Kings of Destruction") gang. While jogging one morning, Hetzko is attacked and has her leg broken. Hetzko and Shale believe this to be related to the KOD, which prompts the latter to go undercover as an [[Ivy League]]-educated, government-affiliated substitute teacher for his girlfriend's class.  Shale arrives at Columbus High School and is, at first, taken aback by the lowly conditions. He is unable to control his class of poorly-educated students on the first day, but decides to use his street-smarts and military tactics to gain the upper hand. Soon enough, he is able to take command of the students by displaying his combat self-defense techniques when students attack him. He is warned not to use such methods by Principal Claude Rolle (Hudson), but gains the respect of his students when he bonds with them over the similarities between his early gang and [[Vietnam War]] experiences and their involvement in petty crime and [[street gangs]]. During this time, he befriends fellow schoolteacher Darrell Sherman (Plummer) and also crosses paths with Lacas, one of his students.  Suspicious of odd conditions within the high school, Shale sets up surveillance cameras throughout the building. He discovers that Lacas orchestrated the attack on Hetzko. He also discovers that Lacas is secretly working with Rolle to distribute [[cocaine]] around Miami for a major narcotics ring. Shale and his team raid a drug deal, using the stolen money to buy music and sports equipment in the form of a "school donation." While Sherman initially denies Shale's discovery and accuses him of being racist by trying to tear down the good works of Principal Rolle (which are only done to give him both distance from and a money-laundering avenue for Rolle's criminal enterprises), Sherman and a female student inadvertently witness the drugs being loaded into one of the school buses later that day. Sherman tells the student to warn Shale and Hetzko, and sacrifices himself by creating a distraction.   Rolle, who at this point is aware of Shale's interference orders a "car accident" for Shale, and sends Lacas after Hetzko. With the help of another student, Sherman is killed and Shale saves Hetzko by fighting and killing Lacas, learning the full story from the female witness. Shale and his team garrison the school grounds to enter combat against the remaining K.O.D. members, a rival mercenary company led by Janus, and Rolle himself. Ultimately, Shale and Joey Six kill all of the dealers and Rolle while ending up as the sole survivors of the battle, walking away from the school grounds discussing future operations as substitute teachers.

A woman named Miss Li steals the money and returns it. Having noticed the money gone, the henchmen start to fight with Miss Li. Miss Li holds her own during the fight, but soon gets into a bit of trouble due to her being outnumbered. Junbao comes to her aid and defeats the gang. Army reinforcements arrive to break up the fight and so the trio run away to escape capture. At this moment the [[eunuch]] governor travels through the town, roughing up the locals as he does so. Tienbo realizes that he wants to be as rich and powerful as the governor, but Miss Li warns him that the governor has "the heart of a viper" and wonders if he could handle this power. Miss Li then shows them to a pub to get food.  Inside the pub, they find a woman named Siu-lin. Siu-lin is searching for her lost husband, during which she supports herself by playing on a [[sanxian]] that said husband gave to her as a gift. She finds him inside the pub as the new husband of the governor's niece. The niece starts a battle with Siu-lin where they both seem equal, but the husband hits Siu-lin on her head with a stool causing her to collapse. Junbao helps Siu-lin by defending her against her ex-husband and the niece's guards.  The next day, while Junbao and Tienbo are making money with their amazing [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] skills, the governor's second in command spots them and is impressed with Tienbo's abilities (and his eagerness to kow-tow to authority). He offers him a position in the army, which Tienbo readily accepts. However, Junbao is more reluctant to do so and declines going with Tienbo, and so the two go their separate ways.  Later, some soldiers come to the pub to collect taxes (which have increased due to the governor’s greedy nature), but Junbao and the rebels (who have stolen great valuables from the governor to give back to the poor) fight and kill them one by one. One soldier escapes alive and starts off towards the army's camp to warn them about the rebels with Junbao in pursuit. Just in front of the army encampment, Tienbo kills the soldier before he warns the rest of the army about the rebels whereabouts. Tienbo warns Junbao to stay clear of the rebels as they'll get him into trouble. Now knowing where the rebels are hiding however, Tienbo takes this unique opportunity to gain a promotion. He sets a trap for Junbao and the rebels by telling them that the army is on patrol and when would be the best time to attack them.  Junbao and Siu-lin collect all the rebels from the region and go to the army camp (thus, falling for Tienbo's trap). A big battle occurs where most of the rebels die. Tienbo captures Miss Li and Siu-lin. In the end, the only survivors are Junbao and a few rebels.  Because of the trap, the governor promotes Tienbo to [[lieutenant]]. With his new authority (and some poignant advice from the governor), Tienbo kills Miss Li and holds Siu-lin as bait, so that he can try to convert Junbao to the army's cause. This is unsuccessful, and Junbao rescues her. Due to the fact that his best friend betrayed him, Junbao's mind snaps, and he goes crazy for days. While recuperating in the countryside with Siu-lin, he has a sudden epiphany that leads to him regaining his mental health and inspiration for the creation of the martial art of [[Tai chi|Tai Chi Chuan]].   While the governor is traveling to [[Beijing]] to see the empress, he encounters Junbao and Siu-lin who defeat his niece and the soldiers guarding him. With the governor captured as a hostage, they go to the army camp and demand Tienbo surrender his wealth and his power. Due to his arrogance, Tienbo declines and starts to fight Junbao, thinking that he is still the inferior fighter. To Tienbo's surprise, however, Junbao is now fighting using the heretofore unseen style of Tai Chi Chuan. Because the style relies less on size, power, speed and strength, Junbao is able to fend off Tienbo with ease. Seeking an additional advantage in their fight, Tienbo kills the governor in order to gain complete control over the troops surrounding them. Siu-lin intervenes and convinces them not to listen to Tienbo as he just betrayed their leader. Seeing this (and also the way Tienbo utilizes his troops as battle fodder), the troops back off and leave Tienbo's fate to Junbao. After a stunning series of parries and blows by Junbao, Tienbo is defeated and ultimately killed due to his reluctance to accept fate and admit defeat. After the fight, Siu-lin and Junbao go their separate ways, with Junbao returning to the Shaolin temple and establishing [[Wudang Mountains|his own school]] to teach [[T'ai chi ch'uan|Tai Chi Chuan]].  
Szamanka
 In Warsaw, a student only known as the "Italian" (Polish: ''Włoszka'', played by Iwona Petry) is on the search for an apartment. The Italian, who is beautiful and a free spirit, is originally from the countryside. During her search she meets anthropology professor Michał ([[Bogusław Linda]]), who is renting her an apartment that was occupied by his brother. The business is concluded by a violent sex scene between the two in the empty apartment.  Michał is engaged with Anna (Agnieszka Wagner), an architect and daughter of his director. During excavations with his students and his younger colleague Juliuz ([[Paweł Deląg]]) he finds the well-conserved body of a shaman more than two thousand years old. In the laboratory they study the mummified shaman, who is covered in mystical tattoos and is found to have a pouch of hallucinogenic mushrooms. They try to determine the cause of the shaman's death, which does not seem to be natural. The back of his skull has been crushed; they theorise this was perhaps done to release his spirit after his death.  The life of Michał is turned upside down by the discovery of the shaman's body and his increasingly obsessive love affair with the Italian. For the Italian, he breaks with his fiancée Anna and his friends. He tries to tame the Italian, but she resists his domination, always unforeseeable and rebellious. In the laboratory, the researchers consume the shaman's mushrooms, and in a delirium attempt to bring him back to life. In a moment of illumination, Michał speaks with the spirit of the shaman. He reveals to him that he was killed by a woman who wanted to capture his magic power. Michał, who finally regards himself as free and lucid, breaks up with the Italian. She bludgeons him to death, crushing the back of his skull, like the shaman's, and eats his brain.

The following morning, Jade visits her father Les and informs him of the [[Human sexuality|sexual]] encounter with Billy though she doesn't disclose his identity or what his [[Social relation|relation]] is to her.

Tenchi the Movie: Tenchi Muyo in Love
  After being defeated by the Jurai Emperor and the Galaxy Police centuries ago, the monstrously powerful Super A-1 class criminal Kain was imprisoned in the subspace room of the GP's headquarters, never to be released.  In the present (established to be 1996, the year of the film's release), Kain escapes his bonds, destroys the GP space station, and travels back in time to take his revenge on Jurai's royal family. The Galaxy Police only has time to send a short warning, which Mihoshi and Kiyone intercept.  The Masaki house, the shrine, and [[Tenchi Masaki|Tenchi]] himself all begin to fade out of existence. Washu theorizes that someone is tampering with the established timeline, and uses a shield to keep Tenchi from vanishing. The shield is only a temporary solution, so Washu sends the rest of the group back to 1970 to prevent Kain from killing Tenchi's mother Achika.  Tenchi's friends assume roles at Tenchi's father Nobuyuki and Achika's high school, while Tenchi himself stays hidden to prevent causing a [[paradox]]. Tenchi and his friends must also deal with a rogue GP operative bent on seizing glory by killing Kain.  After determining the exact time that Kain strikes in 1970, the group tries to defend Achika, only to see the villain escape into subspace with her and Nobuyuki. Tenchi, Ayeka and Ryoko follow and challenge Kain, but even with their powers boosted by Washu they are no match for him.  Washu sends a powerful "dimensional cannon" from the present, and Kiyone mans the weapon to destroy Kain. Tenchi is wounded, and Achika unlocks her latent Jurai powers to fuel his sword and deal a crippling blow to Kain. The group barely escapes in time before the dimensional cannon is fired into their pocket of subspace, finally destroying Kain.  Before her memory is wiped along with Nobuyuki's, Achika asks Ryoko and Ayeka to take care of Tenchi, since she will not be there for him in their present.  
Taxi (1996 film)
 After failing one of her midterm exams in a [[Madrid]] high school, Paz Velasco decides to drop out of the academic circuit. She takes this prompt decision much to the chagrin of her father, an overbearing taxi driver. In exchange, he forces her to join him at work so she can learn the trade and earn a living.  Her reconnection with the so-called "Family", the close-knit group of her father's co-workers, is initially uneventful. One of its members is Dani, Paz's childhood sweetheart and a young taxi apprentice about to be [[Military discharge|discharged]] from the [[Military service#Spain|military service]]. Upon meeting for the first time in many years, they rekindle their mutual attraction and start dating, much to the apparent satisfaction of Dani's mother Reme—a fellow cabbie who is having a secret affair with Paz's father. Reme's husband is a former taxi driver who, according to the explanations given to Paz, was shot by two drug dealers during a robbery. One of the shots left him [[Spinal cord injury|paralyzed]] and the "Family"'s visits to him in the hospital are a staple in their common social life. Aside from Dani, Velasco and Reme, this group is completed by a shady individual named Calero and a thuggish brute nicknamed "Niño" who seems to act as an informal henchman of sorts for the former. Paz realizes Calero is a former [[police officer|cop]] even before being told so, and their mutual distrust is vivid and ever-increasing throughout the film.  From the outset, it is made clear to the audience that the "Family" is in fact a [[neo-fascist]] [[death squad]] whose members use their cabs to abduct non-white, immigrant, [[LGTB]] and [[drug-addicted]] customers with murderous intent. There is also some evidence of rudimentary tactics, e.g. using code words for each "kind" of victim in order to lure unwitting victims to the killing box. Dani has been recently groomed into the group and partakes in their activities, although it is made apparent to the audience that he does so reluctantly. The "Family" seems to be generally successful in its exploits: two murders are shown on-screen, as well as a raid on a Moroccan camp during which Dani accidentally kills a man. The film does show, however, one botched attack during which the victim manages to run away unharmed. It is left unclear whether or not the group is restricted to the core members shown onscreen. It is also left unclear whether the group's activities were prompted by the attack that crippled Dani's father or it was just a casual event that fuelled them further, or whether the version given to Paz was a lie and the attack was a direct result of the group's illegal pursuits. Their activities are spontaneous and seemingly not officially sanctioned, but there are ominous references by Calero to people "up there" who know and approve of the group's activities, leaving the door open to speculation on a wider conspiracy.  Although initially ignorant of the actions and general demeanour of the "Family", Paz gradually finds out the truth through a series of details and coincidences, such as a profusion of [[Falangism|fascist]] and [[Francoist Spain|pre-democratic]] antics and regalia, purportedly intimate family reunions attracting [[skinheads]] and other sinister individuals and ending in massive [[Roman salute#20th century adoption by Fascists|Roman salutes]], casual bigoted remarks from her father and Dani (as well as the latter's violent outburst on a black street vendor) and a disturbing pattern of codenames or "labels" directed at different collectivities. Paz's unassuming and long-suffering mother seems increasingly distraught at the prospect of having Dani close to her daughter, and although Paz initially blames this on his general lack of education and ambition, it becomes increasingly clear that her mother knows more than she says about him and the whole group.  Once confronted with the evidence, her disgust and adamant disapproval set up a chain of events leading to the climax. The paranoid and increasingly unstable Calero, who saw her as a potential liability to the group from the very beginning, now wishes to silence Paz at all costs. He shoots (and presumably kills) her father when he tries to stop him, and confronts her and Dani in the [[Buen Retiro Park|''Retiro'']] Park, shooting Dani, and being shot to death by Paz seconds before he is about to finish him off. The camera pans over the park as she walks away with the injured Dani, and credits roll. The fate of the rest of the group is left undisclosed.

That Thing You Do!
 In 1964, in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], aspiring jazz drummer Guy Patterson is asked by Jimmy Mattingly and Lenny Haise to sit in with their band at an annual talent show, after their regular drummer breaks his arm trying to jump over a parking meter. The band, which also includes bassist T.B. Player, adopts the name "The Oneders" (pronounced "wonders", but often mispronounced "oh-NEE-ders"). At the talent show, Guy launches into a faster tempo than intended for Jimmy's ballad, "[[That Thing You Do (song)|That Thing You Do]]", and the band wins the competition. The Oneders' performance at the talent show earns them a paying gig at a local restaurant, after which they make a recording of their song and begin to sell recordings of "That Thing You Do". They are noticed by talent promoter Phil Horace; he promises to get their record played on the radio and they sign with him as their manager.  Horace achieves radio airplay for the song and books the band at a rock & roll showcase concert in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], after which they are offered a contract by Play-Tone Records [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative Mr. White. White changes the band's name to "The Wonders" as they join a [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] Play-Tone tour, taking along Jimmy's girlfriend, Faye, as their official "costume mistress". During the tour, "That Thing You Do" garners national radio airplay and becomes a bona-fide hit. As the band's popularity soars, Jimmy grows frustrated that the group is not focused on creating more music, while the remainder of the band enjoys their time in the spotlight. All the while, Guy and Faye grow closer as friends. When the song enters the top ten on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' charts, the band is taken off the tour and sent to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].  Faye falls ill on the trip and is nursed by Guy. Jimmy is seemingly uninterested in her well-being, being preoccupied with trying to convince White to let the band record more of his original songs. After a publicity tour, the band is set to appear on ''The Hollywood Television Showcase'', a nationally televised live [[variety show]]. They begin to show signs of discord. Jimmy continues to vent frustration at White over the band's direction. T.B. (who was leaving to join the [[United States Marine Corps]] in a few weeks) goes to [[Disneyland]] with a group of Marines, misses the TV show, and never returns; he is replaced in the broadcast by a session bassist. During the performance, as the band is being visually introduced to the viewing audience, the caption "Careful girls, he's engaged!" appears under Jimmy's name. Jimmy, assuming the caption was Faye's idea, becomes upset with Faye in the dressing room afterward, and says that he has no intention of marrying her. Heartbroken and weary with his arrogant personality and lack of devotion, Faye terminates their relationship and as she walks out Jimmy states he should have dumped her in Pittsburgh. Guy is appalled and it is obvious he has strong feelings for Faye.  The next day at a scheduled recording session, Lenny who left on a trip to Vegas with his new girlfriend, is missing and Jimmy's grievances with White reach a boiling point when he is not allowed to record his own songs and he quits the band. Guy is sorry to see the end of the band. White confronts him, and declares the band a [[one-hit wonder]], but commends Guy for his smarts and integrity. After an impromptu [[jam session]] with his idol, jazz pianist Del Paxton, Guy returns to the band's hotel, where he catches Faye before she leaves and is encouraged by the bell captain to intercept her and shares a long kiss with her.  In an epilogue, it is revealed that Jimmy went back to Play-Tone and formed another band and had a successful career as an artist and producer, Lenny becomes a hotel and casino manager in Nevada, and T.B. earns a [[Purple Heart]] for injuries suffered at [[Battle of Khe Sanh|Khe Sanh]].

Outraged by the injustice, Suzanne's 106-year-old father, Tadzu Lempke ([[Michael Constantine]]) curses Billy by touching his face and saying the word "thinner". Billy begins to lose weight rapidly, despite him not working out or sticking to his diet. Heidi, fearing the weight loss may be due to cancer, brings in Dr. Mike Houston ([[Sam Freed]]), with whom Billy soon begins to suspect his wife is having an affair.  It is revealed that Tadzu Lempke also cursed Judge Cary and Police Chief Duncan Hopely ([[Daniel von Bargen]]), who helped him avoid punishment in court. Cary, whose curse was "Lizard", is now growing scales all over his body. Chief Duncan, whose curse was "Leper" becomes mutated with large boils and eventually commits suicide. Billy continues losing weight and calculates that he only has a few weeks to live. He begins eating even more compulsively to prolong the starvation. Billy looks for the gypsy carnival, to get Lempke to remove the curse, but they have gone.  When Heidi continually mentions Dr. Houston, who is repeatedly visiting their home, Billy is convinced of her affair. He lashes out at her and blames her for the accident. He finds the gypsy camp and tries to reason with Lempke, but instead angers him into increasing the curse's effects. Galina, Lempke's great-granddaughter ([[Kari Wuhrer]]), uses her slingshot to shoot a large ball bearing which goes directly through Billy's hand, infuriating Billy into vowing revenge against Lempke and his gypsies. Billy then enlists Richie Ginelli's help. Richie pays Frank Spurton (Josh Holland), a local hustler, to go down to spy and report the gypsy camp. Richie then kills their dogs, and leaves a message demanding Billy's curse be removed. In retaliation, Galina and her husband Gabe kill Frank—insisting the curse will never be lifted. Richie vengefully brings a gun to the camp and personally begins opening fire on everything, then pushes Gabe out into the open to be accidentally shot and killed by his fellow gypsies. He then impersonates an [[FBI]] agent, kidnaps Galina and begins torturing her. He promises he will kill her if the curse is not taken off of Billy, then tells Lempke to meet Billy at the lighthouse.  At the meeting, Lempke finds Billy emaciated and near death. To prevent further attacks on his people (especially his granddaughter), he finally agrees to lift the curse. Lempke explains that the curse cannot be removed, only transferred to another person. Chanting a spell, he mixes Billy's blood into a [[strawberry pie]]. Lempke states that after being consumed by an unsuspecting person, the pie causes painful but rapid death, and the curse will be lifted. He urges Billy to eat the pie himself and die with dignity, but Billy refuses. He calls Linda, telling her to spend the night at her friend's house, so that he and Heidi have the evening to themselves. He arrives home and presents to Heidi the strawberry pie, which happens to be her favorite flavor. She delightedly eats a piece, while Billy heads to bed, exhausted.  The next morning, Billy finds Heidi's desiccated corpse next to him. He is gleeful to be free of the curse and of his disloyal wife. However, when he goes downstairs, he finds to his horror that Linda, who came home after he went to bed, had eaten some of the pie for breakfast. Wracked with guilt, he prepares to eat the rest of the pie. However, Billy is interrupted by Dr. Houston who is at the door. Seeing Billy, the doctor grows uncomfortable and struggles to explain his early and unannounced presence. Billy invites Houston in for a piece of pie, and closes the door with a smirk, after referring to Houston as "white doctor from town" in Lempke's dialect.

Things I Never Told You
 The film opens with a voice-over by Don, who states that in life and relationships, "anything can happen."  Ann works at a camera shop in a small town in the Pacific Northwest.  One day, she gets called by her boyfriend who is in Prague and gets dumped by him.  Ann makes a halfhearted suicide attempt by drinking a bottle of nail polish remover.  After she leaves the hospital, her psychiatrist gives her the number to a crisis help line.  One evening, still distraught over being abandoned by her boyfriend, Ann calls the number and speaks with Don, who volunteers there because he finds it less depressing to talk with other depressed people about their problems than to stay at home and feel sorry for himself.  They make an emotional connection, but Ann hangs up on him when Don admits that he doesn't really know what love is.   The same time this is happening Ann begins making a series of emotional video tapes addressing her ex-boyfriend and how desolated she is by him leaving her.  She gives the tapes to a neighbor who works at a package delivery service to send to Prague, but the neighbor secretly opens the packages, watches the tapes, and becomes infatuated with Ann.  In an apparent coincidence some time after they spoke on the phone, Don walks into the camera shop where Ann works and buys a camera from her for his work as a real estate agent.  While they talk, Ann makes a comment about happiness being "unfair" that is similar to something she said when she called the help line and spoke with Don then, and he apparently realizes who she is but does not let that on to her.    Apparently attracted to Ann, Don hangs around in a coffee shop waiting for her to get off from work.  He approaches her on the street, and she invites him to help her do her wash at a local laundromat.  They talk for a while in the laundromat, and then she invites him to come to her house in a couple of days.  Don comes over to Ann's house, and they go inside and have sex.  Don is unaware that Ann has taped this encounter with the apparent intent of sending the tape to her ex-boyfriend (but once again, the neighbor holds onto and watches the tape).  After their encounter, Ann ducks Don's calls.  After a couple of days, Don gets called to help the police persuade a man who he had been counseling to come out of a hotel room where he is apparently hiding with a gun.  Don talks to the man and prevents him from killing himself but is badly injured when the gun goes off.  When Ann hears about what has happened, she rushes to the hospital and waits until Don is out of danger but leaves when it becomes clear he will recover.  While this is happening, Ann's ex-boyfriend calls her and tells her he wants to get back together with her.  Ann hastily packs her belongings and leaves the town without leaving word to Don or her ex-boyfriend.  Don goes home from the hospital and begins traveling frequently in his job as a real estate agent.  The film ends with Don musing about what he would tell Ann if he saw her while he sits on a park bench.  A woman walks by, looks at him, sits down, and smiles at him.  He looks up and sees it is Ann.  Before the credits roll, we hear a voice-over of Don saying again, "Anything can happen."

Tin Cup
 Roy "Tin Cup" McAvoy ([[Kevin Costner]]) is a former [[golf]] prodigy who has little ambition. He owns a [[driving range]] in [[West Texas]], where he drinks and hangs out with his pal Romeo Posar ([[Cheech Marin]]) and their friends. Dr. Molly Griswold ([[Rene Russo]]), a clinical psychologist, wants a golf lesson. She asks Roy because he knows her boyfriend David Simms ([[Don Johnson]]), a top professional golfer. They were both on the golf team at the University of Houston. Roy is immediately attracted to Molly, but she sees through Roy's charm and resists.  The next day David Simms shows up at Roy's trailer ahead of a local benefit tournament. Roy thinks he is being invited to play, but Simms actually wants to hire him as a [[caddy]] (since Roy knows the course). During the round, Roy needles Simms about "laying up" instead of having the nerve to take a 230-yard shot over a water hazard. Simms fires back that Roy's problem is playing recklessly instead of playing the percentages. Roy brags that he could make the shot, and spectators begin making bets among themselves. Simms warns Roy that he'll fire him if he attempts the shot, and Roy does, hitting a brilliant shot onto the green. Simms immediately fires Roy.  To get even with Simms, Roy decides to try to qualify for the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] and makes a play for Molly, while also seeking her professional help. Molly agrees to help Roy rebuild his self-confidence in exchange for golf lessons. In two qualifying rounds, with Romeo as his caddy, Roy's game is excellent but his head needs help. Roy insists on breaking the course record, but Romeo implores him to play safely to qualify for the U.S. Open. When Roy demands the Driver instead of laying up, Romeo snaps it in half over his knee. Roy then asks for the 3-Wood and Romeo proceeds to snap it in half as well. Then Roy begins to grab every club out of his bag, snapping every single one in a fit except the 7-Iron, "Then there’s the 7-Iron. I never miss with the 7-Iron". This causes Romeo to storm off the course and quit. Roy then challenges anyone that hasn't left to a bet that he can finish the Back-9 with only a 7-Iron and everyone reluctantly refuses, but he continues the round and amazingly still manages to qualify for the U.S Open. After the qualifier, Roy makes a wager with Simms on a Driving distance contest and Roy gets made a fool of and loses the bet and his convertible to Simms. He reunites with and persuades Romeo to be his caddy again, but develops a problem (the shanks) with his [[golf swing|swing]].  On the first day of the U.S Open tournament in [[North Carolina]] he shoots a horrendous 83. Meanwhile, Molly sees Simms' unpleasant side when he arrogantly refuses a child an autograph. Seeing that trying to change Roy is a mistake, Molly encourages him to be himself. At Molly's suggestion, Roy offers another wager with Simms, the leader after the first round and actually wins the bet and wins Molly's heart as well. Now, with renewed confidence, Roy "Tin Cup" McAvoy, a nobody from nowhere, shocks the golf world by breaking the U.S. Open record for a single round by shooting a 62, thus making the cut. Roy's third round is also excellent and moves him into contention, but on all three rounds, he refuses to lay up on the par-5 18th hole, hitting the ball into the water hazard each time.  On the last day of the U.S. Open tournament, Roy, Simms, and real-life [[PGA Tour]] pro [[Peter Jacobsen]] (playing himself) are in a three-way battle to win the U.S. Open. Jacobsen finishes with a par on 18, tied for the lead with Roy and one shot ahead of Simms. Simms, for the 4th straight day, lays up at the 18th hole, playing it safe, although this takes him out of championship contention. Romeo urges that Roy does likewise to birdie and win the U.S. Open, but is urged by Molly to be himself and "go for it". Roy, for the 4th day in a row, takes his shot and it reaches the green, but then "a little gust from the gods"&mdash;a sudden contrary wind&mdash;starts his ball rolling back, downhill into the water hazard. Reminiscent of his blow-up back in college when he failed to qualify for the Tour, Roy tries repeatedly to hit the same shot, not realizing that he has lost the tournament, but with the same heart-breaking result, splashing in the water hazard. Down to his last ball and risking not only humiliation but also disqualification, he still goes for the green, and on his 12th and final shot, the ball finally clears the water hazard, bounces on the green and amazingly rolls directly into the hole. After a wild celebration, Roy realizes that he has blown winning the U.S. Open, but Molly re-assures him about the immortality of what just happened, "Five years from now nobody will remember who won or lost, but they're gonna remember your 12!"  Back in Texas, Molly tells Roy that because he finished in the top 15, he automatically qualifies for next year's Open. Molly further suggests that Roy go back to the qualifying school and get on the [[PGA Tour|Tour]]. Molly, who gained several clients at the tournament, prepares for a career of helping players with the mental portion of the game. They kiss passionately as the movie ends.

A Time to Kill (1996 film)
 In the town of [[Canton, Mississippi]], ten-year old African American Tonya Hailey is abducted, raped, and beaten by two local men, Billy Ray Cobb and Pete Willard.  The duo dump her in a nearby river after a failed attempt to hang her. Tonya survives, and the two men are arrested by Sheriff Ozzie Walls.  Tonya's father, Carl Lee Hailey, contacts Jake Brigance, a white lawyer who previously defended his brother. Brigance admits the possibility that the rapists will walk free. Carl Lee goes to the county courthouse and opens fire with an automatic rifle, killing both rapists and unintentionally injuring Deputy Dwayne Looney with a ricochet, whose leg is later amputated. Carl Lee is arrested and Brigance agrees to defend him.  The rape and subsequent revenge killing gain national media attention. The district attorney, Rufus Buckley, decides to seek the death penalty, and presiding Judge Omar Noose denies Brigance a change of venue to a more ethnically diverse county, meaning that Carl Lee will have an all-white jury. Brigance seeks help from his defense team: law student Ellen Roark, close friend Harry Rex Vonner, and former mentor and longtime activist Lucien Wilbanks, a once-great civil rights lawyer.  Meanwhile, Freddie Lee Cobb plans to avenge his brother Billy Ray's death by joining and enlisting the help of the Mississippi branch of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and its Grand Dragon, Stump Sisson. On the first day of the trial, the Klan rallies only to be outnumbered by counter-protesters consisting of the area's black and multiracial residents as well as some whites who support Carl Lee. The protest erupts into a riot that results in dozens of injuries and the death of Stump Sisson. The Klan also begins to target Brigance, assaulting his elderly secretary and her husband (who ends up dying of a fatal heart attack brought on by the assault), burning a cross on his lawn and threatening his wife and daughter. When Brigance refuses to back down, Cobb kidnaps and assaults Roark. The Klan increases their attacks, including burning Brigance's house.  Dispirited, Brigance tells Carl Lee that there is little hope for an acquittal. Carl Lee replies that he had chosen him as an attorney because even a racist jury would listen to a white man; as "one of the bad guys", he has an influence that a black man will never have.  During closing arguments, a deeply shaken Brigance tells the jury to close their eyes and listen to a story. He describes, in slow and painful detail, the rape of a 10-year-old girl, recalling the story of Tonya's rape. He then asks the jury, in his final comment, to "now imagine she's white."  After deliberation, a black child runs out of the courthouse and screams, "He's innocent!" Jubilation ensues amongst the supporters outside. The Klan, enraged, begins yelling in anger. Meanwhile, Sheriff Walls arrests Freddie Lee for his crimes, as well as a corrupt deputy who is also a member of the Klan and is standing next to the sheriff.  Brigance brings his wife and daughter to a family cookout at Carl Lee's house to celebrate his freedom.  
Three Lives and Only One Death
 [[Pierre Bellemare]], a French radio personality appears to recount four strange, seemingly non-coexisting, tales that make up the complex narrative structure of ''Three Lives and Only One Death''. In the first tale we are introduced to Andre Parisi, a family man who has woken up with a terrible headache. Andre leaves to a local cafe where he meets one of the multiple enigmatic central characters, Matteo Strano ([[Marcello Mastroianni]]). Matteo offers Andre champagne and 1000 francs to listen to his story. Prior to the scene of Matteo’s own storytelling, he reveals he was once married to Andre’s wife. Matteo recounts the day he went out, on a whim, and rented out an apartment. Matteo insists this apartment is inhabited by fairies who eat time and who ultimately devoured 20 years of his life in one night. Matteo uses the story of his “strange journey in time” to entice Andre into going to his “fairy house.”<ref name="Book"></ref> Andre accepts Matteo’s request and is surprised to find that the apartment actually exists. Matteo takes Andre’s fondness for the apartment as an acceptance of a deal that allows Matteo to go home, leaving Andre to remain in the bewitched apartment. When Andre refuses to take Matteo’s place “he finds himself with a hammer in his head, thus retrospectively explaining his headache as a premonition.”<ref name="Book" /> After a 20-year hiatus Matteo returns to his former home and his former wife, Maria, as if nothing had changed.  Bellemare then recounts the tale of George Vickers, a 69-year-old bachelor and Professor of [[Negative Anthropology]] at Sorbonne. When Vickers ascends the main stairs at Sorbonne, to give the opening lecture at a major conference on Negative Anthropology, he pauses and is overcome by a strange force and feeling. The strange force takes him to a graveyard where he shortly experiences grief. When a storm breaks out he becomes profoundly happy, so much so that he does not look for shelter. He becomes a beggar overnight and strangely finds success.  Vickers is ambushed on a  routine walk home to an abandoned courtyard, but is saved by a prostitute Tanya La Corse aka Maria Gabri-Colosso. Tanya takes Vickers back to her apartment. Vickers explores her apartment and grabs sight of a series of books by Carlos Castañeda. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Vickers occasionally hears Carlos’s voice. Vickers professes a passionate loathing of those works in Tanya’s apartment. Vickers and Tanya/Maria form a firm friendship; Vickers even moves to a new bench to be closer to his new friend. Tanya/Maria tests the new friendship by entrusting in Vickers to keep a close eye out for her extremely dangerous ex-husband. When Vickers fails to alert Tanya/Maria he returns home to a bench outside his mother's home. When he learns of her death he “experiences a strange feeling of nostalgia” and returns to his role as a professor. One day the past catches up with him and he learns Tanya/Maria also lived a double life as the president of a huge electric company, who had been led to prostitution by her husband. Vickers and Tanya/Maria rekindle their relationship and marry. Like clockwork, Vickers once again ascends the main stairs at Sorbonne when he suddenly pauses, walks back down the stairs and leaves for the graveyard. Meanwhile, Tanya/Maria('s) ex-husband returns and "re-ignites her taste for the perverse.”<ref></ref> Both Tanya/Maria and Vickers once again reverse back to their roles as Prostitute and as beggar.  Bellemare opens the third tale with an announcement about the foundation of the tale, that of which “extreme happiness is an extreme form of misery and excessive generosity is an excessive form of tyranny.” Bellemare also proclaims that the next story is “so true it has taken place not once, but several times.” This third tale which revolves around a young Parisian couple, Cecile and Martin, in love sets the stage for the “crossing between the stories and roles played by Mastroianni."<ref name="Book2"></ref> The young couple receives a mysterious weekly gift of 2,000 francs in their mailbox and proceed with their perfect happy life. Both Cecile and Martin “embark on affairs out of kindness.”<ref name="Book2" /> Cecile cheats on Martin with the next door neighbor, Piotr, a college student who cannot bear to hear the couples "all-consuming" love for each other. Martin unknowingly finds employment with Cecile’s mother, Maria from the first tale; they too have an affair. However, the young couple forgives one another. The stories from earlier begin to collide in a seemingly rapid pace. Cecile takes a job working for the businesswoman Tanya/Maria. Later, Tanya/Maria and her ex-husband attempt to entice the young couple into perverse games, but they throw the idea out when they notice the young couple isn’t sexy. One day the couple doesn’t receive their regular earnings in the mailbox, due to the fact that their “protector” has died. However, their protector remembers them in his will and leaves to them the possession of a Mansion and its butler. The butler, another character played by Mastroianni, responds only to the sound of a bell. The butler plays odd games with the couple, who are now expecting a child. The butler hides the bell and drugs them into sleeping for days on end. One strange night Martin finds the Butler conversing with a businessman and a “tramp.” The tramp leaves Martin bloodied and dazed. This leads to the couple's immediate departure. Their inability to recognize Mastroianni as proprietor and butler results in him claiming the couple's new-born child, which he later leaves on Maria's door steps.  In the final tale Bellemare introduces Luc Allamand, a successful businessman in his 70’s. Luc receives a surprising phone call, in the middle of the night, detailing the arrival of his ex-wife, daughter and sister. Luc is taken aback by the news because they do not exist, he invented them for business reasons. Feeling ill Luc returns home and finds his wife, “a 32-year-old star singer in the hands of her accompanist.” Carlos’s voice can be distinctly heard whispering, this appears to turn Luc into a sleepwalker. Luc then wanders aimlessly and returns to Maria and his former home as Matteo, once again as if nothing had happened. Mastroianni’s multiples identities begin to cross at a more rapid pace. Maria supposedly awakes Matteo, but instead hears Vickers talking in his sleep about Negative Anthropology. Maria then confronts Matteo about his “mistress” Tanya/Maria. The sudden sound of a bell brings triggers Vickers the beggar. His begging nearly turns violent, but Maria is able to find a coin in time to reverse Vickers back to Matteo. That same day Mastroianni’s characters return to their former residences. Meanwhile, all the women in his life have been receiving threatening letters. Luc returns to his office where he meets with a famous psychologist Luca Agusta, who congratulates Luc for inventing three women that now exist. After awakening from a bad dream Luc heads to a river where he is confronted by Carlos. In the meantime, all the women in his life rendezvous at a cafe where they encounter all of Mastroianni’s characters. All of the identities become murderous and converge in the cafe, resulting in a series of deaths.

The rebels and the Spanish authorities work out a truce with the [[Pact of Biak-na-Bato]] in 1897, and Del Pilar follows Aguinaldo in exile to [[Hong Kong]]. However, Aguinaldo is convinced by [[United States|American]] officials to resume the revolution as an ally of the United States, which has [[Spanish–American War|declared war on Spain]]. Del Pilar follows Aguinaldo back to the Philippines as the Americans launch their invasion in 1898.   By the end of 1898, most of the country has fallen to American and Filipino forces and Aguinaldo has declared Philippine independence in his home province of [[Cavite]]. But this is ignored by both the Spanish and American authorities, and Spain formally surrenders the Philippines to the United States alone through the [[Treaty of Paris, 1898|Treaty of Paris]].   Tensions between the Americans and Filipinos erupt with the [[Philippine–American War]] (called the [[Philippine Insurrection]] by the Americans) in early 1899. The outgunned Filipino forces are repeatedly defeated, and Aguinaldo is forced to go on the run to the north.   In December 1899, Del Pilar and his men fight the [[Battle of Tirad Pass]] in [[Ilocos Sur|Ilocos]] province to cover Aguinaldo's retreat, aware it is probably a [[suicide mission]]. Their [[last stand]] holds up the pursuing Americans for some time until a [[Januario Galut|Filipino guide]] leads the Americans to higher ground, surrounding del Pilar's forces. His men are all wiped out, and he charges the Americans alone on his horse, but a shot in the neck fells him from behind. The Americans strip his corpse for souvenirs and leave it unburied. Aguinaldo later sees Del Pilar's riderless horse and sheds a tear.  
Trainspotting (film)
 Edinburgh heroin addict Mark Renton buys opium suppositories from dealer Mikey Forrester to help him quit. After his final hit, and a violent spell of diarrhea caused by cessation of heroin, he locks himself in his flat to endure the [[Heroin#Withdrawal|withdrawal]] period. Finding that his sex drive has returned, he leaves a club with a girl, Diane, and they have sex in her bedroom. In the morning, he realises that Diane is underage and that her "flatmates" are her parents. Diane threatens to reveal the encounter if he ends the relationship.  Renton and his friends, oafish but good-natured Spud and con artist Sick Boy, start using heroin again. His friend Tommy, a clean-cut athlete whose girlfriend has dumped him after a chain of events initiated by Renton, also begins using. Fellow addict Allison discovers that her infant daughter Dawn has died without the group noticing; all are horrified, especially Sick Boy, Dawn's father.  Renton and Spud are arrested for shoplifting. Spud goes to prison, but Renton avoids punishment by entering a [[Drug Interventions Programme|drug interventions programme]], where he is given [[methadone]]. Despite support from his family, Renton is desperate for a more substantial high and escapes to his drug dealer's flat. He nearly dies of an overdose, and his dealer sends him to hospital in a taxicab. Renton's parents lock him in his childhood bedroom to force him through withdrawal. Renton has hallucinations of Diane singing, his friends giving him advice, Dawn crawling on the ceiling, and a TV game show in which presenter [[Dale Winton]] asks Renton's parents questions about [[HIV]].  At the insistence of his parents, Renton has an [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV/AIDS test]]; despite years of sharing syringes, Renton tests negative. Depressed, he visits Tommy, who has succumbed to addiction and is now HIV positive and severely ill. Renton moves to London and takes a job as a property letting agent. He begins to enjoy his new life of sobriety, and saves money while corresponding with Diane. However, to his annoyance, Renton's sociopathic friend Begbie, who has committed armed robbery, and Sick Boy, now a pimp and drug dealer, move into Renton's bedsit unannounced.  After Tommy dies from AIDS-related [[toxoplasmosis]], the three travel back to Scotland to attend his funeral. They meet Spud, who has been released from prison. Sick Boy suggests a lucrative heroin transaction, but needs Renton to supply half of the initial £4,000. Renton injects himself with a sample to test the heroin's purity and the four sell the heroin to a dealer in London for £16,000. During their celebration at a pub, Renton secretly suggests to Spud that they steal the money, but Spud is too scared of Begbie to consider it.  Renton tires of Begbie after witnessing him [[Glassing|glass]] and beat a man whom he bumped into. Early in the morning, as the others sleep, Renton takes the money. Spud sees Renton leave, but remains silent. When Begbie awakens, he destroys the hotel room in a rage. Spud and Sick Boy leave when the police arrive. Renton reiterates his vow to live a stable, traditional life and leaves Spud £4,000.

Samantha Callen ([[Shannon Sturges]]) is a government auditor who must determine whether Dr. Branson's project warrants more funding. Jake has to try to convince Samantha that the machine is worthwhile.

To Face Her Past
 Beth Bradfield ([[Patty Duke]]) is a housewife with what appears to be a stable life in an American village. One day, her 24-year-old daughter Lori ([[Tracey Gold]]), who is married to Jesse Molina ([[Maurice Benard]]) and recently gave birth to his daughter Molly (Laura and Megan Jaime), unexpectedly collapses and is hospitalized. After several tests, she is diagnosed with [[leukemia]]. Her doctor ([[Erick Avari]]) reveals to Beth that Lori is in urgent need of a donor, though her rare blood type makes finding one a difficult task.  After a period of time without finding a donor, during which Lori's health worsens, Beth realizes that only confronting a dark secret from her past can save her daughter: when Beth was eighteen years old, she was set to marry a young man named Greg Hollander ([[James Brolin]]), and shortly after found out that she was pregnant. She gave birth to a daughter, but gave her up under the immense pressure of Greg's parents Vic (Francis X. McCarthy) and Kate (Susan Brown), who felt that Greg and Beth were too young to start a family. Megan was raised by her grandparents, under the pretense that her mother abandoned her.  Back in the present, Beth meets Megan ([[Gabrielle Carteris]]) for the first time since her birth. Megan, now a successful vice-president for a company, has not been able to forgive her mother over the years, and refuses to help her. She later decides, though, that she wants to do all that she can to help save a woman's life, and agrees to be Lori's donor, though she makes clear that wants nothing to do with Beth. After Lori finds out that her donor is her sister, she bonds with Megan. Over the time, Megan's hostile behavior towards Beth disappears.  Trouble starts again when the doctor informs Beth that tests with Lori's father are essential. What Beth has been fearing for years is now reality: After a test, it turns out that her husband Ken Bradfield ([[David Ogden Stiers]]) is not Lori's father. Nine months before Lori was born, Beth had a short-lived affair with Greg. Realizing that Greg is Lori's father, Beth contacts him to help her, but Greg remains distant and refuses to be a part of their lives. Nevertheless, Lori eventually recovers after a successful surgery. Meanwhile, Ken has found out about Lori's true father. Even though he does not forgive Beth, he comes to terms with the truth and he realizes that even though he is not Lori's biological father, he will serve as her father no matter what.  
Tromeo and Juliet
    Set in modern-day [[Manhattan]], the film begins with the [[narrator]] ([[Lemmy]] of [[Motörhead]]) introducing two families: the Capulets and the Ques.  At the center of these families are [[Romeo Montague|Tromeo Que]] and [[Juliet Capulet]]. Tromeo lives in squalor with his alcoholic father Monty and works at a tattoo parlor with his cousin [[Benvolio|Benny]] and friend [[Mercutio|Murray]]. Juliet is sequestered in her family’s mansion, watched over by her abusive father [[Lord Capulet|Cappy]], passive mother [[Lady Capulet|Ingrid]], and overprotective cousin [[Tybalt|Tyrone]], all the while being sexually satisfied by family servant Ness ([[Debbie Rochon]]).  Both Tromeo and Juliet are trapped in cases of [[unrequited love]]: Tromeo lusts for the big-bosomed, promiscuous [[Rosaline|Rosie]]; Juliet is engaged to wealthy [[meat]] tycoon [[Count Paris|London Arbuckle]] as prelude to an [[arranged marriage]].  In the meantime, a bloody brawl between Murray and Sammy Capulet catches the attention of [[Prince Escalus|Detective Ernie Scalus]], who gathers the heads of the two families together and declares that they will be held personally accountable for any further breaches of peace. Almost immediately afterwards, Monty and Cappy start threatening each other with weapons. Sammy gets caught in the window of Monty’s speeding car, where he is thrown head-first into a fire hydrant and (very slowly) dies.  On the insistence of Murray and Benny, Tromeo attends the Capulets' masquerade ball in the hopes of meeting Rosie, only to find another man performing [[cunnilingus]] on her. Tromeo staggers around the party in disillusion until he locks eyes with those of Juliet. The two instantly fall for each other and share a dance until an angry Tyrone chases him out of the house.  Tromeo and Juliet continue to be enamored by one another from afar. Cappy, disgusted at his daughter’s active [[libido]], forcefully imprisons her in a plastic cage as punishment. Tromeo sneaks into the house of Capulet and the two meet once again. After proclaiming their love for each other both verbally and [[sexual intercourse|physically]], they agree to be married. Juliet breaks her engagement with Arbuckle and, with the help of [[Friar Lawrence|Father Lawrence]], the two are married in secrecy the next day.  Tyrone, upon discovering Juliet‘s secret affair, gathers his gang together and challenges Tromeo to a duel. Now a kinsman to the Capulets, Tromeo refuses to fight, suggesting to both sides to bring the lifelong feud to an end. Murray accepts the duel on Tromeo’s behalf and, in the ensuing brawl, is mortally wounded by Tyrone‘s club. Tromeo, enraged by his friend’s death, pursues Tyrone and slays him (through a series of car crashes which dismember him) and goes into hiding from the police.  Learning that she is involved with Tromeo, Cappy savagely beats Juliet and forces her to reconcile with Arbuckle. Arbuckle accepts her re-proposal and the marriage is set. Juliet visits Father Lawrence, who reunites her with Tromeo and enlists the help of Fu Chang, the [[apothecary]], who sells Juliet a special potion which will aide her predicament.  On the day of her wedding, Juliet swallows the apothecary’s potion, transforming her into a hideous cow monster, complete with a three-foot [[penis]]. The mere sight of her causes Arbuckle to leap out of Juliet’s window in fright, committing suicide. Enraged over the loss of his would-be son-in-law and meat inheritance, Cappy attempts to rape and murder Juliet, but Tromeo arrives just in time, knocking Cappy unconscious and bringing Juliet’s appearance back to normal by a single kiss. Cappy awakens, taking both lovers captive by [[crossbow]]-point. While he is distracted, Juliet performs one last act of defiance against her father and electrocutes him.  As Tromeo and Juliet leave the house of Capulet, they are confronted by Ingrid and Monty, who reveal to them the real reason behind the Capulet/Que feud: Long ago, Cappy and Monty were the owners of the successful Silky Films production company. Ingrid, married to Monty at time, struck up an affair with Cappy, eventually birthing a son which Monty raised as his own. Faced with a divorce from Ingrid and the threat of having his son taken away from him, Monty was forced to sign over all the rights of Silky Films to the Capulets in exchange for his son. After the initial shock at the revelation that they are siblings, Tromeo and Juliet are determined not to let their whole ordeal be for naught; they [[incest|passionately embrace]] and drive off into the sunset.  The film picks up six years later in Tromaville, New Jersey, where Tromeo and Juliet, now married, have become suburban [[yuppie]]s with a house and (birth defected/deformed) children of their own.  The film ends with the narrator’s brief poem for the lovers: ''"And all of our hearts free to let all things base go/As taught by Juliet and her Tromeo"''. A brief shot of William Shakespeare laughing uproariously is shown before the end credits.  
Tremors 2: Aftershocks
 A man on an oil field in [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]] flees from an underground creature which emerges and eats the man, revealing it to be a [[graboid]]. Years after the events of [[Tremors (film)|the first film]], Val McKee has moved away and married Rhonda LeBeck, while Earl Basset has squandered his fortune on a failing ostrich ranch. He is approached by Carlos Ortega, who informs him that graboids are killing his workers at his oil field in [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]], and hires him to hunt them down. Earl initially declines, but Ortega's taxi driver, Grady Hoover, convinces Earl to change his mind; both join the hunt. Upon arrival in Sonora, Earl learns that the company would pay him double if he caught one of the creatures alive. He also meets [[geologist]] Kate Reilly and her assistant Julio, who are scientifically investigating the Graboids.  Earl and Grady begin systematically killing the Graboids by using remote-controlled cars rigged with explosives. Realizing the vast number of Graboids, Earl enlists the help of [[Burt Gummer]], who arrives with a truck loaded with firearms and explosives. The next day, Earl and Grady encounter what appears to be a sick Graboid after crashing their truck. They radio for the oil field's mechanic Pedro and wait with the Graboid. That night, the Graboid dies, and Earl and Grady find empty sacs within the carcass. They see Pedro's truck approach from the distance but it eventually stops and does not resume and after moving out to investigate, Grady and Earl find the truck abandoned and only Pedro's arms remaining and the engine motor ripped apart. While breaking into a parked car, they encounter several Graboid-like creatures, later named Shriekers, which have apparently come from their Graboid. Meanwhile, Burt's truck is ambushed by a pack of Shriekers while returning to base.  Julio is killed by Shriekers moments before Earl and Grady arrive and kill them the following morning. The creatures attack and they are forced to hide inside the office. Burt arrives, having engaged the Shriekers and captured a live one. Through experimentation, the group discovers that, through eating, the [[hermaphrodite]] creatures can replicate at an incredible rate. They also learn that the creatures cannot hear unlike their predecessors, but rather see heat through special [[infrared]] receptors on their heads, thus their targeting of car engines. They are attacked by the Shriekers, who chase them throughout the compound. They run for Julio's car, but Burt accidentally disables it while killing a Shrieker.  Hiding from the Shriekers, Burt is trapped in a bulldozer bucket while Grady, Kate, and Earl are on top of an oil tower. The Shriekers work together in an attempt to climb the tower before Burt traps them in the storage shed with the truck. However, they discover [[rice flour]] is stored inside as well, enabling the Shriekers to continue multiplying inside. Earl douses himself in [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]] from a fire extinguisher to hide his body heat, and tries to find Burt's explosives inside. However, the Shriekers eventually detect him, forcing Earl to throw the detonator among Burt's supplies before escaping. The group manages to escape before the explosives level the facility, destroying all of the Shriekers. In the aftermath, Earl and Kate decide to pursue each other romantically, while Grady suggests opening a monster-themed theme park due to the money Ortega now owes them.

When an intruder breaks into the couple's house the following night, Matthew and Joe chase him outside, where a neighbor shoots the intruder. The neighbors conspire to cover up the fact that the deceased intruder was not armed. As the blackout continues for days over a large area, more chaos occurs. As a result, the group decides to flee to Annie's parents' house, 530 [[mile]]s away. They do not have enough fuel to travel the whole way, so they stop by an abandoned car hoping to siphon some. A man, Gary, is lying in the backseat. After Joe notices that Gary has a handgun, he heads back to their vehicle to get his own shotgun. Joe aims the shotgun at Gary to scare him off, but he shoots Joe and steals their vehicle.  Matthew walks an hour to a farmhouse to try to get help for his family. The occupant, Raymond, refuses to help him initially, as he does not trust him. Matthew collects the shotgun and returns to the house, hoping to steal the car. He breaks in to get the car keys, and a standoff ensues between Raymond and him. When Raymond's young daughter enters the room, Matthew returns to civility, lowering his weapon.

Trilogy of Terror II
 ===Story I: The Graveyard Rats=== A wealthy man by the name of Ansford ([[Matt Clark (actor)|Matt Clark]]) discovers his young wife Laura ([[Lysette Anthony]]) having an affair with her cousin. Having video proof he threatens Laura to be faithful and honest or he will turn the video over to the news stations and cut her out of his multimillion-dollar will. Meanwhile, her lover Ben ([[Geraint Wyn Davies]]) comes up with the idea to murder Ansford and collect all his money. After Ansford is pushed down the stairs and killed, Laura and Ben are more than happy to collect their winnings, however all does not go as planned. Before dying, Ansford transferred all of his millions into an account in Zürich, and microfilmed the access codes, which were buried with him. Now, Laura and Ben have to dig up his grave, and Ben climbs into the opened coffin to retrieve the microfilm. Soon after, Laura shoots and kills Ben to claim all the money for herself. All of a sudden, the body of the dead millionaire is dragged through a hole in the side of the coffin by flesh-eating giant rats with red eyes, and Laura is forced to crawl in after him through a network of underground graveyard tunnels. Eventually the advancing rats corner her into another buried coffin. Laura tries to keep the rats away by firing her gun at them but quickly the rats pour into the coffin and devour her.  This first film is based on [[Henry Kuttner]]'s eponymous short story, albeit considerably altered. In Kuttner’s tale, the thief is a male cemetery caretaker intent on exterminating a colony of abnormally large rats.  ===Story II: Bobby=== It has been some time since Bobby "accidentally" drowned, leaving his mother Alma ([[Lysette Anthony]]) depressed and guilty. However, while her husband is away on business, she determines to raise her son from the dead. Armed with a magic book and a "[[Key of Solomon]]" (in this case, a talisman rather than a book), she conjures dark forces to bring her son back. Before going to bed, a vicious thunderstorm approaches the luxurious beach mansion. Hearing a knock, she opens the door to discover her son. After cleaning him up, she begins to make him feel at home again. However, all does not work out when Bobby goes completely mad and begins to terrorize his mother in the dark house with a sledgehammer and a [[butcher knife]]. The mother soon realizes that it is not Bobby who returned to her, but a demon that had taken his place, as he says "Bobby hates you, Mommy, so he sent me instead," revealing his demon-like face and the screen blacks out.  ===Story III: He Who Kills=== This segment, about the Zuni fetish doll "He Who Kills", is a sequel to the third segment of the original ''Trilogy of Terror'', "Amelia".   After finding the double homicide of Amelia and her mother from the first movie with the Zuni Doll at the scene, the local police drop off the doll to local Dr. Simpson ([[Lysette Anthony]]). As she begins to examine the doll she learns that the doll comes to life when a gold chain is removed from his neck and that the Zuni Doll has a desire for flesh. It also seems to regenerate (the idea itself initially laughable to both Dr. Simpson and her assistant) as when she chips away the charred wood, the Zuni Doll seems to be brand new.   After a quick pizza break, she discovers the doll missing. One of the officers investigates the surrounding museum, only to be shot down by an arrow from one of the exhibits, courtesy of the doll. After minutes of looking, she finds the doll attacking and running towards her with a lab knife as a weapon. Now Dr. Simpson is all alone in a large museum with a tiny killer on the loose. Much like the first movie, Dr. Simpson catches the Zuni Doll in a briefcase, giving her time to try to reach her keys. As the doll cuts through the case, Dr. Simpson tries twice to grab the knife, only to get cut as in the first film. The doll eventually breaks through, meeting the stabbing force of a screwdriver-like object from Dr. Simpson. Making the same mistake as the first movie's protagonist, Dr. Simpson opens the briefcase to be bitten ferociously by the Zuni Doll. She eventually regains control, and tosses the doll into a large rectangular container of sulfuric acid. As the Zuni Doll comes to a halt in its motion, Dr. Simpson goes to grab tongs in an attempt to remove the doll, only to be possessed by He Who Kills, the spirit inhabiting the doll. Later on she kills her date with the same axe she tried to use against the Zuni Doll.  
Tricheurs
 ''Tricheurs'', meaning "Cheaters", is the story of a gambling addict. Elric was raised in a household of servants to the family in the castle on the hill. He sets his sights on buying it, as he imagines this will make him happy. Although he gets attention and gifts from the casino when he wins, he hardly seems to enjoy his winnings. And even feels unsettled if the casino doesn't takes his occasional winnings. He and his gambling partner Suzie walk on the razor's edge of helping and hurting each other before Elric falls in with the cheater Jorg. This creates a new situation of traveling the world and cheating their way into wealth; but Elric always gambles it away. His obsession with winning has led to him becoming a cheater, but he discovers winning is not as satisfying as he imagined; as he only feels alive when he loses. The question becomes, whether Suzie can lead him out of this purgatory or not.  
Twister (1996 film)
  In June 1969, a deadly [[F5 tornado]] develops in rural [[Oklahoma]] and hits the farm of the Thornton family.  During the storm, the family members, a 5-year old girl named Jo ([[Alexa Vega]]), her parents, and their dog Toby rush to their storm cellar. Although they lock the door, the tornado causes the hinges to become loose. The father ([[Richard Lineback]]) pulls on the door tightly to keep it in place, but the strong and powerful tornado winds rip the door off, sucking him into the funnel to his death. His wife ([[Rusty Schwimmer]]), Jo, and Toby survive. However, Jo is devastated by the loss of her father.   27 years later, Jo ([[Helen Hunt]]) now 32, has studied [[meteorology]] and leads a team of [[storm chasing|storm chasers]]. As the 1996 new storm season begins in March, Jo reunites with her estranged husband, storm chaser Bill "The Extreme" Harding ([[Bill Paxton]]) to finalize their divorce. Bill meets with Jo and her team in the field as they await the storms, accompanied by Bill's [[Engagement|fiancée]], Dr. Melissa Reeves ([[Jami Gertz]]). Bill receives a welcome from his former teammates, Rabbit ([[Alan Ruck]]), Sanders (Sean Whalen), Joey ([[Joey Slotnick]]), Lawrence ([[Jeremy Davies]]), Preacher ([[Scott Thomson (actor)|Scott Thomson]]), Haynes (Wendle Josepher), Beltzer ([[Todd Field]]) and Dusty ([[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]). Leaving Melissa with Dusty, Bill tracks down Jo to ask for the final copy of their divorce papers, which Jo has not signed. She hesitates when she learns Melissa has accompanied Bill into the field, and Jo goes to greet her. Jo also reveals that she and her team have built four tornado measurement devices based on his design in his absence—called "DOROTHY I" through "DOROTHY IV"—which can gather data from within tornadoes and make advanced storm warning systems possible. Shortly after meeting his former team, Bill notices Dr. Jonas Miller ([[Cary Elwes]]), a storm chaser with a corporate-sponsored team. To fix a flat tire at a truck stop, Bill and his team stop at a diner. At the diner, Bill learns that Jonas built DOT-3, a measurement device very similar to DOROTHY, and confronts him for stealing his idea. Jonas asks Jo what her team is planning on doing, but she does not tip her hand.  Deciding to launch DOROTHY before Jonas can launch DOT-3 and take credit for their invention, Bill and Jo gather the team upon hearing of an F1 tornado forming not too far from the diner. They use DOROTHY I and attempt to get to the twister as Bill accelerates down a dirt path. As they get closer, the radio tells them that the funnel is getting thick and moving faster. As they dodge a [[Pac-Man]] shaped roof of a silo, they get stuck in the dirt path followed by mud areas. Abandoning their vehicle, they take shelter under a small, wooden bridge as they hold on a wooden pillar. The twister passes over them, destroying Jo's truck and DOROTHY I. Melissa arrives in Bill's truck as the F1 dissipates, and the wreck of Jo's truck lands in her path, causing her to panic and nearly crash. Bill loads the remaining DOROTHY devices onto his truck and the team continues onward, following an [[F2 tornado]]. However, the winds also spawn two waterspouts, which pass over Bill's truck, frightening Melissa. The three escape unharmed.   As the weather calms, the team travels to [[Wakita, Oklahoma|Wakita]], a small town 8 miles south of the [[Kansas]] Border to visit Jo's Aunt Meg ([[Lois Smith]]), who happily hosts the team. Inside, they enjoy a big meal and a break, when Jo takes a quick shower. Later, she learns of an [[F3 tornado]] nearby, so the team says goodbye to Meg as they are on their way to the next twister.   As the team is close to the F3, hail falls around them. The winds cause the electric towers to topple as the wires become down. Then, the storm damages the DOROTHY II unit, spilling its sensor units. Against Bill's pleas, Jo tries to leave the truck to collect them. Bill forces her to abandon the unit and get back into the truck, driving them safely away. Out of danger, Bill confronts Jo about her obsession with tornadoes, and how it stems from her father's death; Melissa hears this over the open radio. During their discussion, Bill comes to a conclusion that the DOROTHY units are too light to remain stationary to properly disperse the sensors in time; they need a heavy pack to weigh the units down.  During the night, the team rests in [[Canton, Oklahoma]], a town which is an hour away from Wakita and plans on staying at a [[motor inn]] next to a [[drive-in]] theater during the showing of the 1980 horror film, [[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]. Still stinging from Bill's lashing out earlier, Jo signs the divorce papers. Melissa notices the Television fades black. She goes out side to investigate. As Jo and Bill  get [[coffee]] from the snack shack, an F4 tornado suddenly forms near them and demolishes the drive-in, forcing the team, the employees and the patrons to take shelter in a garage. The tornado misses the garage, but instead throws a great deal of dangerous debris, including Rabbit's truck and Preacher's station wagon, through the roof of the garage. The drive-in cinema sign tips over. The storm suddenly passes by. A few minutes later, the emergency services arrive, and Melissa tells Bill that she recognizes he still has feelings for Jo, and amicably ends her engagement, leaving on her own. The team soon learns, much to Jo's horror, that the storm is heading towards Wakita, so they quickly rush to check on Meg. An hour later, they return to Wakita and find that the town had no warning, and has been devastated as a result. Dozens of buildings have been destroyed, and they find Aunt Meg's house still standing, but wrenched from its foundation and falling apart. Bill and Jo rescue Meg and her dog Mose from the collapsed house, and are glad to see she's only suffered minor injuries. As they wait for medical services to take Meg to the hospital, Jo talks with Meg about what had happened. Meg recollects how sudden the tornado had come, that the [[civil defense siren|tornado sirens]] had gone off only seconds before it hit, and that she hadn't even made it downstairs, reminding Jo of the importance to what she seeks to accomplish with the instrument packs. Meanwhile, Dusty receives word from issued weather reports from the NSSL predicting an F5 forming off 25 miles south. Jo notices in Meg's front yard the [[Kinetic art|kinetic sculptures]] barely damaged and turning in the wind. Jo realizes that they can modify the sensors in DOROTHY with wind flaps to give them buoyancy and easily enter a tornado. News of a dangerous and powerful F5 tornado is reported in the nearby area. They have two more DOROTHY Units to deploy. After completing the F5, they will no longer have more. So they leave Wakita and get to the last twister.   As they are almost at the F5, Jo and her team use tools to shear aluminum from soda cans to add blades to each sensor and reload the DOROTHY units. The two units are mounted on Bill's truck, and he and Jo drive into the storm. They attempt to deploy DOROTHY III, but the peripheral winds from the tornado pushes the unit around, and it's eventually destroyed by debris. They hear that Jonas and his team are also trying to deploy DOT-3, and Bill tries to warn Jonas off, believing the mile wide storm will shift course toward them. Jonas ignores his advice, and sure enough, after the tornado makes a sudden shift, Jonas and his driver are picked up, thrown to the ground, killing them instantly and destroying DOT-3. With only the DOROTHY IV unit remaining, Bill and Jo decide to try one last time. They dodge tractors and crash through a small house that tumbles on the road.  Keeping the DOROTHY Unit strapped into the bed of the truck, they hope the vehicle will provide the weight needed to keep DOROTHY IV in place long enough to deploy it.  Bill drives the truck through a cornfield toward the F5 tornado, as Jo activates the sensors in DOROTHY. At the last possible moment, Jo and Bill jump from the truck, deploying the last DOROTHY Unit into the final tornado successfully; her team reports success as the sensors gather data across the entire height of the funnel. However, they find the storm has changed course again, and is now bearing directly onto them. Bill and Jo run to a barn, but find it containing sinister-like blades. They exit the barn and the dangerous tornado rips it apart. Bill and Jo duck under the blades from avoiding getting impaled. They climb up a small hill and reach a small pumping house. Inside, they use leather straps instead of a chain to anchor themselves to the pipes which are anchored deep underground. The tornado demolishes the pumping house, but the two remain secure to the pipes, and are able to witness the [[Eye (cyclone)|eye of the storm]] as it passes over them. The dangerous tornado then starts to dissipate.  As the storm dissipates, they see the farm house, family and horses survived virtually untouched. They reunite with Jo's team and celebrate their success, and Bill and Jo decide to form a new lab to analyze the new data, giving their marriage a second chance in the process.

Her father William ([[Daniel Baldwin |Baldwin]]) disapproves of her clothes and friends. William's aggressive attitude has a negative impact upon his daughter's relationship with Brad ([[David Lascher |Lascher]]), the captain of the high school football team. When Jennifer tells Brad that she is unable to attend a concert with him because her father refused to give her permission, Brad decides to break up with her. He feels that William is exerting too much control over the relationship. Although Jennifer is shocked, the fact that Brad chooses to display interest in another girl at school makes her feel even more frustrated.  After meeting Nick Ryan ([[Jeremy Jordan (singer)|Jordan]]) at a gas station, they soon form a close relationship and begin going out with one another. Nick is infamous in his neighborhood for having spent time in jail on an assault charge. When Jennifer's parents decide to spend a weekend away from the house, Jennifer uses this as an opportunity to get closer to Nick. Her parents decide to return early and she is caught in her parents' bed with Nick. William is unable to contain his fury, threatens Nick and chases him out of the house. She claims she loves Nick and decides to see him secretly. She applies makeup to her own eye to make it appear bruised. When Nick notices her "black eye", he expresses concern and asks Jennifer to stay with him. Although she refuses, she is touched by Nick's concern. Back at home, Jennifer is caught by her mother, who is disgusted by the fact that her daughter had sex in the parents' bed. Jennifer's mother tells Jennifer that she will no longer protect her from her father, nor take her side.  Nick visits Jennifer's house, and states that he loves her. He also warns William not to treat Jennifer in such a harsh manner. William is shocked by Nick's audacious behavior and threatens to sue him for [[statutory rape]]. The next morning, William is shocked to find his car vandalized. A furious William contacts the police and Nick is soon questioned. He, however, claims he didn't have anything to do with the damage. Jennifer overhears her father saying he is determined to get Nick behind bars. Fearing her father, she tells Nick they can't sneak around any longer. She convinces him to use his grandfather's pistol to shoot and kill William. While he is planning the murder, she goes back to her normal life. She tells her friends that she broke up with Nick. She also presents herself to her parents as someone who has changed and wishes to embark upon a more truthful life. On the night of the murder, as Jennifer and Nick walk towards Jennifer's parents' bedroom, Nick changes his mind and is adamant that he is unable to go through with the murders. Jennifer vehemently encourages him to complete the task he promised to perform.  After the killing, Jennifer is sent to live with her grandparents, and the police presume the murder was motivated by a robbery. Nick becomes the prime suspect and is constantly harassed by the police. Jennifer rekindles her relationship with Brad. She calls the police anonymously with information that leads to the discovery of the murder weapon implicating Nick. The police think, with Nick in custody, that the case is now closed. However, Detective Daniels ([[Eric Laneuville]]) suspects that Jennifer is more involved in the case that she led the police to believe when she was being questioned. Upon confronting her, she claims that Nick was angry at Jennifer's parents for not letting him see her, thereby giving an explanation of what might have motivated Nick to commit the murders. Meanwhile, Jennifer's best friend Karen ([[Meadow Sisto |Sisto]]) finds her diary, in which she admits her involvement and that she used Nick to get her parents out of the way so she could have Brad.  Karen decides to visit Nick in jail, trying to convince him that Jennifer set him up. He later talks to Jennifer about it, but she gets mad at him, blaming him entirely for the murder. Upset, he admits to the police that he killed her parents, but that it was Jennifer's idea. Not much later, the police claim her diary, but she has rewritten it in the meantime, preventing an arrest. Frustrated about the injustice, Karen sneaks into Jennifer's house to collect evidence, but she is almost caught. Meanwhile, a trial against Nick has started. Jennifer gives false testimony, claiming that Nick harassed her. Karen is determined to stop her, but Jennifer threatens to give false proof that she was also involved with the murder. Eventually, Brad manipulates her into admitting that she is responsible for the murder. Having recorded their conversation, she is soon arrested for murder. In the end, it is announced that she was tried as a juvenile, and would be released from prison at age 21.  
True Blue (1996 film)
 ''True Blue'' is a film adaptation of Topolski's [[True Blue: The Oxford Boat Race Mutiny|book of the same name]]. Although names and events were changed, it tells the story of the 1987 Oxford Cambridge Boat Race, from the perspective of Topolski and Macdonald. Directed by Ferdinand Fairfax, this low-budget film was made by [[Film4 Productions]], starring [[Dominic West]], and [[Josh Lucas]].  The film opens with a fancied Oxford crew losing by 'almost seven lengths' to Cambridge. Macdonald and Ross (a [[sobriquet]] for the real life Chris Clark) are seen in the losing crew. The crew's various reactions are shown, and later Clark pledges to bring some American oarsman over to get one of the famous Oxford Blades.  The film cuts to the next year where the recent world champion Daniel Warren (Dan Lyons) arrives in Oxford with some other Americans. Not all are happy about the new arrivals, however, and are concerned for their seats in the boats. We then see a montage of training sequences before the Fours [[Head of the River Race]], for which the top boat is changed at the last minute at the instigation of Warren, prompting fury from the ejected crew member. The crew goes on to finish 28th, a very unimpressive placing for a Varsity squad boat.  Topolski is then shown berating the squad, and the other coaches share concerns about the form of the athletes, particularly Ross. Topolski decides to look at the results of the Trial Eights race, which initially looks good, but is marred by a clash of blades.  The Americans later rebel against the coaches and say they will walk out if Ross is not selected. In the end none of the Americans row and Topolski goes with a less experienced crew. After initial tensions the crew comes together and trains well for the last few weeks before the race. On race day the crew wins by around four lengths.

  Dr. David Krane (Ray Liotta) arrives at a crime scene, an apparent drug store robbery. Where he finds a piece of evidence, a rolled up paper match book, that reminds him of a similar match book found at his wife's, Mary Krane, crime scene.  Convinced that the killer is the same man who killed his wife, Dr Krane approaches the detective, Don Bresler (Peter Coyote) on the case. Dr. Krane shows Det. Bresler photos of the matchbooks found at both scenes.  Det. Bresler ask Dr Krane what he wants him to do, and Dr. Krane asks him to question the suspect in the current case about his Mary's murder.  Det. Bressler agrees, but tells Dr. Krane, "Sometimes you have to let it go."  Later, Dr. Krane goes to a dinner where Dr. Martha Briggs gives a lecture on her experiment to transfer memories via cerebral spinal fluid.  After the lecture Dr Krane makes an appointment with Dr. Briggs to go over her research.  Dr, Briggs is then approached by an unidentified woman who tells her that Dr. Krane was a suspect in his wife's murder, and if the police department had not botched the investigation he would be on death row.  The following day, at Dr. Briggs' office, she goes over the experimental procedure.  She states that neuro-peptides are used in forming memories and can be retrieved from Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF).  However, the peptides themselves are not enough to transfer memories; Therefore, she has created a serum designed to facilitate the memory transfer process.  however, the serum is not enough and an external stimulus similar to the memory must also be present for the memories to successfully imprint on the recipient. She gives Dr. Krane a demonstration and they discuss the formula and side effects of the procedure.  Dr. Krane suggests using nitroglycerin to alleviate the side effects, but Dr. Brigs mentions that that would only be a short term fix, and the long term complications would still exist.  Dr. Krane inquires as to when human trials might start, and she explains she a long way away from that, at least 7 years. Dr. Krane says he would be willing to volunteer to try the serum, and Dr. Briggs responds that not only would it be dangerous, it would be unethical.  Dr. Krane apologizes and then leaves.  Later that evening Dr. Krane retrieves the sample of CFS from his wife's autopsy, and then breaks into Dr. Briggs' office.  He then goes back to his house which is filled with crime scene photos, and other pieces of evidence from his wife's murder, including the taped outline of where her body was found.  Dr. Krane injects himself with the serum, and has a memory flash of the night of his wife's murder, but is unable to see the killer's face.  Dr Krane then returns to the lab, retrieves the CSF from the female victim at the drug store.  Dr Krane drives to the drug store crime scene where he then injects himself, again, with the serum.  During this memory flashback Dr. Krane is finally able to see the killer's face.  He then returns to the police station where he meets with a police sketch artist and tries to create a police sketch of the killer. The sketch artist does a poor job, and forces Dr. Krane to draw the picture himself.  Using the sketch Dr Krane and his friend and colleague, Curtis Avery (David Paymer), enter the sketch into a computer program that generates a searchable photo of the killer.  During this process Dr. Krane has a shocking reaction to the photo that causes a nose bleed.  Dr. Briggs then confronts Dr. Krane about the break in and the theft of her serum, he explains that it works and that is nothing like a true memory as much as you experience the memory as if it were happening to you.  Dr. Briggs is worried about side effects and insists that Dr. Krane receive a physical at her office.  Dr. Krane agrees to come over later that afternoon, and Dr. Briggs insists they do it right then.  The two then go back to Dr. Briggs' office at the University, where she notes that there has been "significant" damage to Dr. Krane's heart, but that the nitroglycerin did indeed alleviate the heart palpitations of the initial injection.  Dr. Krane's beeper goes off, and he uses the phone in Dr. Briggs' office to call Curtis.  Curtis says they got a hit, and that the guy, Eddie Dutton, has a long criminal history, including drugs and several murders for hire.  Dr. Krane asks for his last known address, which Curtis gives him over the phone.    Dr. Krane goes to leave, and Dr. Briggs insists she come with him.  Dr. Krane refuses, but Dr. Briggs threaten to call the police and Dr. Krane relents.  The two travel to a seedy motel where Dr. Krane ask the manager if he knows where Dr Krane can find Eddie Dutton.  The manager asks if he is a cop," to which Dr. Krane replies, no and the manager tells him to get lost.  On the way out of the hotel Dr. Krane sees Eddie in the elevator, and has another overreaction to seeing him.  Eddie asks him, "What are you looking at?" and then makes a disparaging remark about Dr. Krane maybe being homosexual.  Dr. Krane runs down the stairs after Eddie.  Dr. Briggs begins to following Dr. Krane in his car and is yelling at him to stop as he is straining his heart.  Dr. Briggs, who was not paying attention to her driving, hits a parked car which causes a scene.  Eddie sees Dr. Krane is following him and starts to run.

After the scene calms down a bit, Dr. Krane is confronted about his erratic behavior by his supervisor who fires him.  Dr. Krane heads back to the Police station saying he needs to get a few things.  As he enters the station he heads into the men's room, and asks Dr. Briggs to wait for him in the waiting area.  He then heads from the men's room to the autopsy room where he places a fake call for Curtis, so that he can get access to Eddie's CSF.  He steals a sample of Eddie's CSF.  Dr. Briggs and Dr. Krane head back to doctor Krane's house so that Dr. Krane can get some sleep.  Unable to sleep Dr. Krane heads back to the main house and injects himself with the serum, using Eddie's CSF, one more time.  Dr. Krane has a flash of what appears to be Eddie having rough sex with a woman, this woman may be Mary.  In the midst of the memory flashback Dr. Krane makes enough noise to attract Dr. Briggs.  While reliving the killer's memories Dr. Krane inadvertently attacks and begins to choke Dr. Briggs.  During the flashback Dr. Krane sees that Eddie notices Dr. Krane returning to the house and Eddie flees, apparently before Mary is actually dead.  Dr. Krane continues to act out the memory fleeing the house, as Dr Briggs is frantically searching for nitroglycerin.  She finds Dr. Krane at the bottom of the porch stairs and administers the nitroglycerin to him, where he explains that Eddie did not kill his wife, and that he had come home drunk that night and passed out in the front yard while his wife was being murdered.  Dr Krane opens up about how he was a drunk and the marriage was on the rocks.  He mentions that when his wife died she was 5 weeks pregnant.  The next morning Dr. Briggs goes to Curtis and they discuss some type of test, which Curtis reluctantly agrees to.  Later as Dr. Briggs is running the DNA for paternity Dr. Krane walks in and is angry that she would test the paternity without consulting him.  The paternity test shows the baby is not Dr. Krane's, and Dr. Briggs says that the man who killed Mary might be the father of the child.  She then asks Dr. Krane if he has any idea who it might be.  Dr. Krane rushes over and confronts Mary's sister Kelly (Kim Cattrall).  They verbally spar, and Dr. Krane says he will go to the cops, and Kelly says she won't allow him to rob Mary of her dignity, and that Mary was having an affair with a police detective.  Dr. Krane takes this new evidence to Det. Bresler, while talking to Det. Bressler Dr. Krane begins to have flashbacks of an arrest and interrogation of Eddie.  These flashbacks cause a heart attack and Dr. Krane is rushed to the hospital.  Dr. Krane begins to have flashbacks of the night and subsequent events of Mary's murder.  While Dr. Krane and Dr. Briggs are at the hospital the janitor at the university enters Dr. Briggs office to mop, setting off an explosive device that destroys a large portion of the university building.  After Dr. Krane recovers, Det. Stewart Gleick (Christopher McDonald) the original detective on Mary's case, approaches Dr. Krane in the hospital saying that he asked around and a detective Boddner, might be the guy.  The problem is that Det. Boddner tried to commit suicide on the same day Mary was killed, but ended up in a coma instead.  Dr. Krane and Dr. Briggs go to the hospice where Det. Boddner is being kept, and take a sample of his CSF, so that Dr. Krane can experience his memories.  Dr. Krane and Dr. Briggs argue about who should take the injection due to Dr. Krane's recent heart attack.  Dr. Krane agrees to allow Dr. Briggs to take the injection, because Det. Boddner committed suicide Dr. Krane says he is not taking any chances and he tapes Dr. Briggs to the seat.  With Dr. Briggs immobilized Dr. Krane injects himself.  He confirms that his wife was in fact having an affair with Det. Boddner.  Mary met Det. Boddner who was a witness against Det. Bresler, who was a dirty cop.  As Dr. Krane is reliving these memories, Det. Bresler arrives at the house and begins to set the scene to kill Dr. Krane and Dr. Briggs, by lighting a fire.

As this occurs, Jody is told by his mother and aunt that his supposedly heroic idol Sam, was in fact an alcoholic [[Psychopathy|psychopath]], who physically and sexually abused them, and only joined the military so he could get a "free pass" to kill people.  Jody is told by Barry, another boy who has established an unexplained mental link with Sam, that the undead Sam is responsible for the deaths. With help from Sam's old mentor Jed, the boys goes to Jody's house, where they find the lecherous sergeant, who dropped Sam off, dead and stuffed inside Sam's coffin. Realizing that Sam will probably go after Louise, the boys and Jed go to her home, where Sam blames Jed, who told him tales of how glorious combat was, for his current state. Jed retorts by yelling, "You never fought for your country! You just killed for the love of killing!"  Jed's gun proves ineffective against Sam, so he and Louise go to get Jed's cannon while Jody, who Sam claims is the reason he came back, keeps Sam occupied.

Weather Report Girl
 The story revolves around Keiko Nakadai, who in the beginning is an [[Office Lady]] working at the perpetually last-place ATV television network. However, she is chosen to fill in for weather reporter Michiko Kawai for one night, and Keiko takes full advantage of her opportunity by blatantly flashing her panties while on live television. The incident causes the evening news ratings to jump, and because of ATV's desperation to escape the ratings cellar, Keiko is subsequently promoted to full-time weather reporter, displacing Michiko in the process. The rest of the series focuses on her rivalries with co-workers jealous of and insulted by the nature of her success.  The humor in ''Weather Report Girl'' is full of sexually oriented sorority style humor, aimed primarily at young men. The protagonist, Keiko, is depicted as being exhibitionistic, first using her sex appeal to rise to the position of weather girl by flashing her bra and panties, and maintaining her position by frequently wearing lingerie while on the air. She is also very resourceful, always one step ahead of her rivals' various revenge schemes. Keiko is also extraordinarily vengeful, humiliating Michiko on the air by spiking her tea with laxatives after Michiko had attempted a similar tactic against her. Keiko proceeds to masturbate in her apartment while watching Michiko embarrass herself on television.  Finally, she is sexually domineering, effectively enslaving Michiko—who due to the on-air incident would have been fired had she not agreed—by making her lick her lingerie and perform cunnilingus on Keiko.  The second episode introduces Kaori Shimamori, a reporter who uses her position as a member of the [[National Diet|Diet]] at Keiko's expense. Kaori conspires to have Keiko demoted after allotting her weather corner during a breaking news report. This effort fails after being flooded with viewer mail protests. Soon after, Keiko and Kaori agree to partner up on a marketing campaign for ATV, though still plotting revenge against Keiko by eavesdropping on her. She soon discovers Keiko's [[dominatrix]] relationship with Michiko and becomes friends with Keiko. The [[Original video animation|OVA]] ends with a stripping and humiliation of Michiko in which Kaori embraces Keiko's lifestyle and then proceeds to entice Michiko into having oral sex with her while Keiko, half asleep, listens with a smirk.  
Werewolf (1996 film)
 [[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] working in the [[Arizona]] desert find a skeleton that appears to be a [[werewolf]]. The ill-tempered foreman, Yuri ([[Jorge Rivero]]) gets into a fight with his crew: Tommy ([[Jules Desjarlais]]), Joel ([[Joe Estevez]]), and Bill ([[Randall Oliver]]). In the course of the fight, Tommy is scratched by the werewolf skeleton. This greatly alarms his fellow workers, especially Joel, who incredulously utters the word "''[[Skin-walker#Navajo skinwalker: the yee naaldlooshii|yetiglanchi]]''." The head archaeologist, Noel ([[Richard Lynch]]), dismisses all Native Americans from the site, but in a private meeting later that day, explains that a major problem may be developing; [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] [[mythology]] holds that a "yetiglanchi" is a dangerous individual who takes on predatory lupine characteristics and kills humans.  Tommy is taken to the hospital, where he begins to exhibit signs of [[lycanthropy]]. Yuri sneaks into the hospital and appears to facilitate Tommy's transformation. Shortly thereafter, Tommy fully transforms into a wolf and escapes after killing several people, but Joel and Bill are waiting by his house armed with [[silver bullet]]s, and they kill him in turn.  The action then shifts to a house in suburban [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]], where a writer named Paul Niles ([[Federico Cavalli]]) arrives to take up residence. It is explained that the archaeologists have invited Paul to the area for the purpose of publicizing their find and obtaining funding for their continued research. At a party, Paul is introduced to another foreign-sounding member of the team, Natalie Burke ([[Adrianna Biedrzyńska|Adrianna Miles]]), and he takes a romantic interest in her. Yuri is expelled from the party after [[sexual harassment|sexually harassing]] Natalie, but improvises a plan to create a new werewolf out of an unsuspecting security guard (director [[Tony Zarrindast]]). Yuri is again successful in doing so, but this werewolf attempts to drive his car, and shortly meets his death by running into a stack of flammable oil barrels that were inexplicably placed in the middle of the road.  The following day, Paul visits the lab at Natalie's invitation and is violently attacked by Yuri, who strikes him with the werewolf skull. Paul almost immediately begins showing signs of lycanthropy, even as Natalie attempts to comfort him through an encounter implied to be sexually intimate. An extended series of scenes show Paul's temperament and physical appearance changing, even as Paul himself remains frightened by the sudden changes. Finally, at a [[pool hall]] where Natalie and Yuri are both present, Paul transforms fully into a werewolf, turns feral, and runs out into the streets on a rampage. He assaults several anonymous people and characters from earlier in the film's action, but runs into the woods without a confirmed kill.  Yuri and Noel speak on the phone about capturing Paul and exhibiting him as a [[freak show]], but this enrages Natalie, who wishes to save Paul from such a fate. A chase scene ensues in which Yuri attempts to follow Paul into the desert brush, but Paul locates Yuri and violently kills him. Natalie arrives on the scene late, sees Yuri's dead body, and then returns to Paul's apartment. In a [[twist ending]], Paul takes Natalie by the hand romantically, and it is slowly revealed that both of them are now werewolves.

After a crazy drive into the Wild Wood and destroying a seventh motor car, all Toad, Rat, and Mole are lost in the inhospitable lair of the Weasels. The Weasels attempt to coerce Mole into stopping his friends from interfering with their plans. Toad also runs into the Weasels. The three end up in Mr Badger's underground abode. Badger, a close friend of Toad's late father who feels responsible for Toad's inheritance, decides to end Toad's [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]] with motor cars. However, Toad refuses to listen to Badger and is ultimately arrested for stealing and crashing a motor-car outside a [[pub]]. During his trial, Toad's defence lawyer is no help at all. Furthermore, the Weasels are dominating the public box. The Chief Weasel poses as one of the rabbits in the Jury and coerces the terrified creatures to give a guilty verdict. After Toad insults the Court and makes a botched escape attempt, the enraged Judge gives him a hundred-year sentence in a castle dungeon.  Back in Toad Hall, Rat and Mole are evicted by the Weasels, who have annexed Toad Hall for themselves. Rat and Mole tunnel under the castle to free Toad, but he is helped by the sympathetic Jailer's daughter and her reluctant Tea Lady Aunt. Toad escapes, disguised as the latter. Having forgotten Toad's wallet in his cell, Toad, Rat, and Mole board a [[Steam locomotive|train]]. The police, who have stowed away on the carriages, demand that the train be stopped. Toad confesses the truth and begs the driver to help him evade his captors. If only to protect his train, the driver agrees to help. He tosses coal at the police, but gets caught in a [[catcher pouch|mail catcher]]. Toad takes control of the train and eventually crashes the engine. Having miraculously survived, he sets off again but is finally caught by the Weasels.  The full extent of the Weasel's plans are now revealed: they have built a [[dog-food]] factory over the remains of Mole's house and are planning to blow up Toad Hall and build a slaughterhouse in its place, with which they will turn all of the peaceful Riverbankers into dog food. They have also damaged the area near to Badger's home, which provokes him into taking decisive action against them. Badger and Rat attempt to infiltrate Toad Hall disguised as weasels, but are captured. Along with Toad, they are placed over the factory's [[mincing machine]]. The Chief, Clarence and Geoffrey return to Toad Hall to prepare the victory celebration, leaving St. John in charge of the machine. Mole, who has broken into the factory, disables the machine allowing Toad, Badger and Rat to escape.  In a premature sense of victory, Clarence and Geoffrey attempt to blow up their Chief using a birthday cake. Clarence and Geoffrey begin to fight each other for leadership, with the other Weasels drunkenly taking sides. This distraction allows the protagonists to stage a raid on the house, leaving all of the Weasels incapacitated in the ensuing fight. It turns out that the Chief has survived the coup against his life. Toad attempts to stop him from reaching the factory, which contains the detonator to blow up Toad Hall, to no avail. Unbeknownst to both of them, the explosives are actually in the factory (Rat had switched the labels on the explosive's containers earlier, leading the Weasels to believe the explosives were actually bone supplies for the factory), and as such the Chief blows himself up along with the factory, leaving Toad Hall intact and Toad's friends safe and well.  Afterwards, Toad makes a public speech swearing off motor cars and promising to be wiser and less prideful in the future. Mole's home has been repaired and he can go back to it. However, Toad is seen secretly talking to an airplane salesman, which shows that he has only moved on to a new craze. Toad flies over the crowd in his new plane, causing mass hysteria and Badger swears never to help Toad again. During the end credits, Toad flies across the country and eventually over the sea.

Young and Dangerous 2
 The re-informed with the events of the [[Young and Dangerous|previous film]].  In a flashback to ''[[Young and Dangerous]]'', "Chicken" Chiu ([[Jordan Chan]]) heads into [[exile]] and decides to go to [[Taiwan]], after a failed [[contract killing|hit]]. The first part of the movie details the events leading up to his return to [[Hong Kong]], following the death of his boss "Uncle Bee" (Frankie Ng). In [[Taiwan]], Chicken's cousin introduces him to the "San Luen" [[triad (underground societies)|Triad]], headed by an influential [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] senator. Although the atmosphere in the city is quite different than [[Hong Kong]], Chicken gains the senator's favor by assassinating his rival. Pleased with the youth's initiative, he promotes Chicken to branch leader and does not even mind Chicken having been smitten with his beautiful [[mistress (lover)|mistress]]. Upon hearing news of Bee's death, Chicken returns to [[Hong Kong]] and helps best friend [[Chan Ho Nam]] ([[Ekin Cheng]]) to get rid of corrupt "Hung Hing" Chairman "Ugly Kwan" ([[Francis Ng]]).  The second part of the movie deals with returning Hung Hing Chairman Chiang Tin Sang (Simon Yam) trying to ally with San Luen and promote relationships, while trying to find a replacement branch leader of [[Causeway Bay]], a position Bee held. Ho Nam is the most likely candidate, being Bee's must trusted underling, but a rivalry breaks out when another member "Tai Fei" ([[Anthony Wong Chau Sang|Anthony Wong]]) wants the position for himself. At the same time, Ho Nam's friend Pou Pan ([[Jerry Lamb|Jerry Lam]]) recruits "Banana" (Jason Chu), who bewilders Ho Nam and the rest of his friends because of his facial similarity to Pou Pan's deceased brother Chow Pan. During a visit back to [[Taiwan]] to see and thank the senator personally for helping them get rid of Kwan, Ho Nam and Chicken find him dead and are accused by San Luen of killing him.  In actuality, the culprit is the senator's mistress, who uses this opportunity to lead San Luen and break Hung Hing's grip on their gambling spots in [[Macau]], reinforcing San Luen influence in the area. To that end, Tai Fei willingly allies with her and plots to have Ho Nam's candidacy for the [[Causeway Bay]] branch leadership tainted. Ho Nam is barely swayed by Tai Fei's threats, until a car accident cripples his girlfriend Smartie ([[Gigi Lai]]), putting her in a [[coma]]. Although disheartened at her condition, Ho Nam does not back out of the candidacy, and plans to stage an intervention at a San Luen opening of a new [[Macau]] [[casino]], during which an important member of the [[Macau]] government will attend. Ho Nam's sabotage of the event is successful, destroying any credibility San Luen has in [[Macau]] and to Tai Fei's nomination.  In a tense [[Mexican standoff]] at town square, the senator's mistress and Tai Fei decides to settle things with Ho Nam and Chicken, summoning hundreds of San Luen and Hung Hing members. While it appears the victory is in the mistress' hands, it is Tai Fei who turns the gun on her: it was all a ploy on Hung Hing's part for him to ally with San Luen and provide a means to weed out any corrupt members in the Taiwanese society. Realizing it was she who killed the senator, San Luen's branch leaders decide to take her back to [[Taiwan]] for punishment, but Chicken requests he speak with her before she is led away. Upon stating she is the only woman he has ever truly loved, he executes her on the spot, knowing full well she will die more painfully in [[Taiwan]]. With the matter settled, Tai Fei abstains from the [[Causeway Bay]] branch leadership candidacy and Ho Nam is elected its leader.

Young and Dangerous
 Beginning in 1985, teenagers [[Chan Ho Nam]] (Ekin Cheng), his best friends "Chicken" Chiu (Jordan Chan), Tai Tin Yee (Michael Tse), Pou Pan (Jerry Lam) and older brother Chow Pan (Jason Chu) idolise the local "Hung Hing" Society and one of its leaders, "Uncle Bee" (Ng Chi Hung). When Ho Nam and his friends are beaten by Hung Hing's "Ugly Kwan" (Francis Ng) and his men following a misunderstanding, they decide to join the society, following Bee.  10-years later in 1995, Ho Nam and his buddies have established themselves as Bee's enforcers, performing their first successful [[contract killing|hit]] on Kwan's associate "Ba Bai" (Joe Chen). At the same time, Brother Fai Hung has the stuttering Smartie (Gigi Lai a.k.a. Tania Sammy) [[carjack]] Ho Nam's [[Toyota MR2]] and demands payment, but unfortunately she gets caught by Ho Nam and his friends and is punished by eating dozens of [[Cha siu baau|Chinese barbecue pork buns]].  Seeing Ho Nam is making a name for himself in the society, Kwan attempts to buy him out and have Ho Nam work for him instead of Bee, but the gangster refuses. When he finds Smartie about to be forced into an [[adult film]] produced by Kwan's studio, Ho Nam takes her aside, claiming she is his woman. The indebted Smartie follows him, even beginning to fall for him. One day, Bee is tasked with an assignment by Hung Hing chairman Chiang Tin Sung (Simon Yam) to head to [[Macau]] and perform another hit. Bee orders Ho Nam and his men to execute the plan. Sadly, this was all a ploy on Kwan's doing: by using Chicken's fidelity to separate  him from Ho Nam and falsifying information to chairman Chiang, Ho Nam and his remaining friends are ambushed by other triad members under Kwan. Chow Pan is brutally killed and Ho Nam is blamed for the failed hit. Friendships begin to tear apart when Chicken's girlfriend and Ho Nam are kidnapped and drugged by Kwan's men into sex, videotaping their actions as proof of violating orders. With nearly all of Hung Hing looking for them for explanations, Chicken heads to [[Taiwan]] in exile.  At a Hung Hing summit, Kwan accuses Bee of failing the hit and Ho Nam for breaking the "code" of sleeping with his best friend's woman, with the videotape as evidence. Kwan also takes the opportunity of blaming chairman Chiang for not inducing better protocols within the society and nominates himself as the new chairman. Other branch leaders are in agreement, thus Chiang steps down and Kwan takes the head position, with only Bee opposing him. To settle things, Ho Nam is punished and banned from rejoining Hung Hing. Ten months later, Kwan orders Bee killed alongside his entire family. With most of Hung Hing siding with Kwan, and no evidence to support Kwan killing Bee, Ho Nam can do next to nothing, until Chicken returns from Taiwan, now a branch leader in a local triad and re-establishes relations with his friends. Deciding to get rid of Kwan and bring back the morally inclined Chiang, Ho Nam and Chicken bribe other branch leaders into assassinating Kwan. Working indirectly with local law enforcement, who have discovered Kwan has been smuggling [[cocaine]] using his film studio, Ho Nam and his allies manage to corner Kwan, who admits to everything, until he is shot and killed by a police officer for mistakenly wielding a firearm.  Chiang returns and retakes the position of Hung Hing chairman, congratulating Ho Nam for his efforts, ensuring his name will be well known throughout the society. This movie glorifies the value in being virtuous even in a life of crime. In a world in which loyalties do not exist, these group of young gangsters stood by their friends and followed the code of friendship even to the end.

XX: Beautiful Prey
 An undercover policewoman gets caught up in the underground [[BDSM]] world, while investigating a gruesome murder.  
Zazel
 "Zazel" is the [[Title role#Title character|title character]], a world-famous [[artist]] commissioned to create "the most arousing [[perfume]] ever". In the course of devising this scent, Zazel variously [[painting|paints]] pictures, views [[photograph]]s, and wanders among the [[flower]]s of her [[garden]], each experience inspiring her to envision a powerful [[sexual fantasy]]. The film consists of nearly a dozen individually themed sequences which reference and recreate [[iconography]] drawn from [[mythology]], [[religion]], [[literature]], [[film]] and even [[Jungian psychology]]. These include [[Siren (mythology)|siren]]s, water [[nymph]]s, [[mermaid]]s, [[flower]]s, the [[jungle]], ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', classic old [[Hollywood]] movies, [[angels]] and [[demons]], and the [[Jungian]] duality of [[male]] and [[female]].  Each sequence features an imaginative and novel treatment of [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] based on these themes, as well as several visual/anatomical puns achieved through the strategic use of [[body paint]], [[Fetish fashion|fetishistic costumes]] and accessories, and ''[[trompe l'oeil]]'' camera placement and editing trickery.  It is notable that Sasha Vinni, who plays Zazel and also narrates the film, never has [[heterosexual intercourse]] in any of her scenes: she simply [[masturbates]] and engages in [[lesbian]] activities with the other female performers.  [[File:Zazel-cover.jpg|thumb|right|200px|<center>''Zazel'' - [[DVD]] cover (1997)<br>features Gina LaMarca and Sasha Vinni.</center>]]  ==="Blue Siren" sequence=== In the opening sequence, Sasha Vinni emerges from a pond as the "[[Siren (mythology)|Blue Siren]]", her nude body is painted bright blue and multiple arms appear and gesticulate behind her like the [[Avatar]] of the [[Hindu deities|Hindu god]] [[Vishnu]]. She then performs [[cunnilingus]] on the "[[Naiad|Water Nymph]]" (Grace Harlow).  ==="Wild Orchid" sequence=== Sasha Vinni as Zazel sits at her desk and [[airbrush]]es an image of a [[flower]]. A [[visual pun]] is created as the [[petal]]s start to move and contract and reveal themselves as artfully painted [[Labia (genitalia)|labia]]l folds.  ==="Bird of Paradise" sequence=== Sasha Vinni appears as an assistant to a male lover/[[tattoo artist]] played by Devin Deray. Sasha Vinni shaves Lene Hefner's [[groin|crotch]] with a spa razor, rinses it with an [[urn]] full of water.  The tattoo artist then designs a colorful flower pattern on Hefner's [[vulva]]. The trio then engage in sex.  ==="Jungle" sequence=== In the "[[Jungle]]" sequence, Sasha Vinni's nude body is artfully painted with [[Tiger|tiger stripes]] as she writhes and crawls through tropical vegetation.  The scene ends with a [[close-up]] shot of a woman (whose face is never seen) with a tiger's face painted on her [[buttocks]]. The woman [[Woman on top (sex position)|rides]] a man's [[Human penis|penis]], creating the illusion that the tiger's face is "[[fellatio|fellating]]" him.  ==="Precious Flower" sequence=== This sequence is yet another variation on the flower motif as Sasha Vinni is shown penetrating herself with flower-shaped objects and [[masturbation|masturbating]].  ==="Three Musketeers" sequence=== In the "[[Three Musketeers]]" sequence, Sasha Vinni, Brooke Lane and Anna Romero appear in 17th-century-style period costume based on the characters of the [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Dumas]] novel. They strip, [[French kiss]], perform [[cunnilingus]] on one another, and [[masturbate]] by penetrating themselves with rubber [[dildo]]es which they have outfitted on the back of their [[riding boot]]s like [[spur]]s.  ==="Angels" sequence=== The "[[Angels]]" sequence is filmed in bright, diffuse light and features three women (Sasha Vinni, Brooke Lane and Helena) as "Female Angels", each with elaborately knotted hair and coated in pale, peach-colored body paint.  These three female angels perform various sexual acts with a similarly painted man outfitted with giant angel's wings (Antonio Valentino)—the "Winged Male Angel". (Anna Romero and Kevin James served as [[body double]]s.)  ==="Old Black-and-White Movie" sequence=== The [[black-and-white]] sequence is the only one to feature no lesbian sex at all, and it is also the only part of the film in which Sasha Vinni does not appear. It begins with Gina LaMarca as "[[Seduction|the Seductress]]", wearing ornate white [[pasties]] over her breasts with a matching white crotch guard (see [[:File:Zazel-cover.jpg|DVD cover]] above), gyrating on a bed.  The fetish accessories are soon removed and she and her male partner (Jon Severini) engage in various sexual activities. Cross-cutting from the man's final [[cum shot|ejaculation]] on her belly, they are also seen performing a tumbling dive into a [[swimming pool]] while holding hands and then resurfacing to embrace and cuddle in the water.  ==="Mysterious Union" sequence=== Sasha Vinni performs a sensuous [[erotic dance]] with one half of her face and body painted and dressed as a woman in a skirt, and the other half made up as a mustachioed man wearing a suit. Vinni takes turns showing her "female" and then "male" side to the camera while the other half remains hidden in shadow and out of view. The sequence concludes with an outlandish-looking woman—shaven-headed except for a teased-up [[blond|lemon blonde]] [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] (which might be a wig) and with spangled [[clothespin]]s fastened to her [[nipple]]s—who is seen to be [[fellatio|fellating]] an ornate glass perfume bottle.  ==="Water Odyssey" sequence=== In the penultimate sequence in the film, Sasha Vinni and Nikie St. Gilles appear as [[mermaid]]s outfitted with tail fins.  They dispense with the mermaid accessories and engage in lesbian activities. As in the "Blue Siren" sequence, some of the [[cunnilingus]] activity is filmed underwater.  ==="Diablo d'Inferno" sequence=== The "[[Devil|Diablo]] [[Hell|d'Inferno]]" sequence features Anna Romero as a "[[Supernatural beings in Slavic folklore|She]]-[[Devil]]" in a [[Fetish fashion|fetishistic]] red [[latex]] devil's costume—outfitted with red latex horns, red latex [[ballet boots]], open-bottomed red latex [[hot pants]], and a long red latex forked devil's tail protruding from a flared [[butt plug]] attachment that is embedded in her [[rectum]]. (Although Sasha Vinni appears in this costume on the [[:File:Zazel-cover.jpg|U.S. DVD cover]] [see image above], only Anna Romero wears it in the film.) During this sequence the lower portion of the screen is filled with digitally superimposed flames for atmospheric effect.  The She-Devil sneaks up behind Zazel, who is sitting at a table [[airbrush]]ing a design of the She-Devil and her costume, and "decapitates" the artist with a [[scythe]]. The She-Devil crawls around Zazel's freshly "severed" head, now placed upon the table. The She-Devil grips the shaft of her latex tail and pushes the butt plug attachment deeper into her anus before thrusting her [[vulva]] into Zazel's face. The She-Devil [[French kiss]]es Zazel's head and continues to [[anal masturbation|anally masturbate]] with the tail/butt plug.  The scene continues with the She-Devil (now with the tail/butt plug removed) having sex with a "[[Gargoyle]]" (Kevin James) and a "[[Demon|Demon Man]]" (Drew Reese), which ends with a vaginal/anal [[List of sex positions#Multiple penetration|double penetration]].  
Young and Dangerous 3
 Weeks after Chan Ho Nam ([[Ekin Cheng]]) is elected branch leader of [[Causeway Bay]] of the "Hung Hing" Society, "Chicken" Chiu ([[Jordan Chan]]), after joining the [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] "San Luen" triad, is reinstated into Hung Hing by Chairman Chiang Tin Sung (Simon Yam). At the same time, rival triad "Tung Sing", led by "Camel" Lok (Chan Wai Man) begins to make a name for itself, establishing bars and clubs alongside Hung Hing's areas of operations. Things become heated when Tung Sing member "Crow" (Roy Cheung) fuels a deep-seated rivalry between him and Ho Nam, with the threat of open war between the two societies. Meanwhile, Ho Nam's stuttering girlfriend Smartie (Gigi Lai), who was critically injured in a vehicular accident and slipped into a [[coma]], reawakens but with [[amnesia|no prior memories]] to her meeting with Ho Nam for the first time. Regardless, Ho Nam assures her he and his friends will protect her. To add in a stick of comedy, Father "Lethal Weapon" Lam (Spencer Lam) introduces his daughter Shuk Fan (Karen Mok) to Chicken, having been good friends and a source of advice for him.  During a business trip to [[Amsterdam]] with his mistress and Ho Nam, Chairman Chiang is assassinated by thugs. While the rest of Hung Hing believes the hit was orchestrated by Ho Nam, it is the deranged Crow who ordered the chairman's death, using Chiang's mistress to falsify evidence, framing Ho Nam. While Ho Nam goes into hiding back in Hong Kong, Crow is reprimanded by Camel; to add to his insanity, Crow kills his own boss and makes it look like a Hung Hing assassination. Drunk with power, Crow wants nothing more than to destroy Hung Hing and orders his men to search frantically for Ho Nam. Fortunately, Ho Nam is quick to realize the ambush and escapes with Smartie, until Crow's men manages to separate the two. In their attempt, Smartie is captured but suffers a blow to the head, restoring her memories. Crow tells Ho Nam if he wants his name cleared and his woman back, he must meet him alone.  Yet, the crazed Crow does not keep his word and kills Smartie in cold blood in front of Ho Nam. Just as Crow is about to finish him, Chicken bursts in and reaches a stalemate with Crow to ensure Ho Nam's safety. The saddened Ho Nam carries Smartie's body out with him and gives her a proper funeral. Now fueled solely on vengeance, Ho Nam decides to march into Tung Sing territory and kill Crow at Camel's funeral haphazardly. Fortunately, Ho Nam's friends and the rest of Hung Hing manage to capture and threaten Tung Sing member "Tiger" (Ng Chi Hung), who tells all of Crow's madness in killing both their societies' leaders. Crow is left nowhere to run from his enemies, and in the midst of a Hung Hing/Tung Sing brawl, he is killed in the [[funeral pyre]]. With Crow dead, Tung Sing is left in disarray, and Hung Hing re-establishes control in its territories.  
Zarkorr! The Invader
 Intelligent aliens who have been studying Earth for centuries decide to challenge mankind by sending in a 185-foot, laser-eyed monster called ''Zarkorr'' to wreak city-crushing havoc. Only one incredibly average young man, postal worker Tommy Ward ([[Rhys Pugh]]), can find the beast's weakness and save the planet with the help of a 6-inch-tall [[pixie]] ([[Torie Lynch]]), who says she is "a mental image projected into his brain" by the aliens. She explains that Zarkorr cannot be destroyed by weapons, but that the key to the monster's destruction lies within the monster itself. Tommy, chosen as an average human, is the one destined to fight Zarkorr, who is programmed to kill him. Tommy asks scientist Dr. Stephanie Martin ([[De'Prise Grossman]]) for advice about his mission, but everyone thinks he is crazy. He takes the scientist hostage, but manages to explain his predicament to one of the policemen, who believes him and helps him escape. Dr. Martin agrees to help him. Using computers belonging to a friend of hers, they establish that the monster, which is destroying city after city in the style of [[Godzilla]], neither sleeps nor breathes. Going to the place where the monster first appeared, they come into possession of a strange metallic capsule that fell out of the sky at the time the monster arrived. It is believed to be unopenable, but it opens by itself for Tommy as he touches it. He uses the top of the capsule as a shield, reflecting Zarkorr's laser rays back at him, and the monster dissolves into a small glowing sphere flying into space. Tommy is taken to a hospital to recover; a TV reporter congratulates him for saving the world, and he jokes he might run for president.<ref name=Mitch265>Mitchell, Charles P.

Jaan (film)
 Police Commissioner Suryadev Singh ([[Amrish Puri]]) is an honest and efficient cop in the city. He has a granddaughter Kajal ([[Twinkle Khanna]]), whom he has brought up after her parents were poisoned by his enemies, and whom he values more than his life. But Suryadev's cousin Vishambar ([[Suresh Oberoi]]) is plotting the complete ruin of Suryadev, along with his wife and his brother in law Bhanwari ([[Shakti Kapoor]]), because Vishambar's deceased father gave all his share of property, including a village Sundernagar, to Suryadev as Vishambar has married someone against his wishes. So Vishambar plans to kill Kajal, as then his revenge will be complete, and the property will fall into his hands since there would be no one to inherit it from Suryadev, which his son Nagendra can inherit. For this purpose, Vishambar hires Karan (Ajay Devgn).  Karan is a young and efficient man in need of money for treating his ailing mother in hospital. By rescuing Kajal in a fake [[kidnapping]] drama enacted by Vishambar's goons, he wins Suryadev's confidence.  Suryadev then decides to send Kajal to his village to stay with some relatives, along with Karan as her [[bodyguard]], convinced that he will protect her from harm.  In the village, Kajal falls in love with Karan, but he does not reciprocate. He even tries to kill her on many occasions, but for some reason, hesitates from finishing her off. Finally, he decides to tell her everything, but Kajal refuses to listen. She woos him till he finally falls for her. Interspersed between all this is [[Johnny Lever]] and his girlfriend with their hilarious acts.  In the meantime, Vishambar gets to know that Karan has fallen for Kajal, so he hires another killer named Dilavar to eliminate both of them from the village. They attack during a festive celebration and take away Kajal, with Karan chasing after them. Karan rescues Kajal, is attacked again by Dilavar and his goons, but he manages to kill them all, including Dilavar. After a brief period of separation in the wilds, both are reunited.  Suryadev arrives at the village on hearing of the disappearance of Kajal and Karan, and gets to know of Karan's real motive because of a note written by Karan meant for Kajal to read, before he falls for her, left in his room. He then orders Karan's [[arrest]]. On searching, he finds his granddaughter with Karan, but she refuses to let him harm Karan, and both [[elope]] again.  In the meantime, Vishambar kidnaps Karan's mother and passes the word to him through Nagendra, who gets beaten up by Karan. Karan and Kajal are finally apprehended by Suryadev. Karan is arrested and [[torture]]d, but he does not reveal who actually has given him the contract to kill Kajal, for fear that his mother would be affected.  Suryadev then arranges for his granddaughter to be married to Rohit, son of his longtime friend. On Kajal's refusal, he tells her the story of how her parents were [[poison]]ed, and he had taken care of her. She tearfully agrees to the [[marriage]], but on the condition that Karan will be released from jail, to which Suryadev agrees.  When Karan is released, he learns about Kajal's wedding plans and leaves enraged, to rescue his mother. As preparations are on for the wedding, Rohit is kidnapped by Bhanwari, and Karan is called to kill Rohit at their hideout if he wants his mother back. Karan goes and rescues Rohit and fights everyone, killing them all. But Suryadev thinks Karan is behind the kidnapping, and gives orders for him to be shot at sight.  Karan arrives at the wedding scene with Rohit and explains everything. Karan then insists that Rohit gets married to Kajal. Vishambar, present at the scene, gets to know of what has happened to his household when he receives a phone call from a dying Bhanwari, and enraged at Karan, snatches a [[machine gun]] and fires indiscriminately as Rohit is being married to Kajal, but Karan saves Rohit and Kajal, fights Vishambar and with a machine gun, kills him.  As the police take Karan away, Suryadev gives him Kajal's hand, saying that he has killed a [[criminal]], he is the real man for her, and he will keep her until he returns, promising him a quick return from jail and marriage with Kajal.
