Ka Fu's father (played by [[Eric Tsang]]) is a [[Public light bus|mini-bus]] driver and his mother (played by [[Teresa Mo]]) is a restaurant hostess. Natalie is from a very affluent family and her parents (played by [[Candice Yu]] and [[Anthony Wong Chau Sang|Anthony Wong]]) are lawyers. In the beginning, Ka Fu and his two close friends, Bing and Sai wait to see Natalie outside her school every single day until she invited them to her school's Christmas party despite knowing that visitors were forbidden to go. They were eventually discovered by the school principals. While Bing and Sai successfully escaped, Ka Fu was caught but they decided to forgive him. Ka Fu took Natalie home, where they celebrated her 16th birthday, and Ka Fu spent the night there.  Another contrast is that Ka Fu has a loving relationship with his parents, but Natalie's relationship with her parents is distant as they are often away on business trips. Eventually, Ka Fu and Natalie gotten close with each other as they got to know each other more. It is exactly this window of opportunity of Natalie's parents' absence that causes the two to have a weak moment in their budding love for each other, which results in Natalie getting pregnant during a camp out for New Year's Eve. Natalie eventually found out herself when her pregnancy test came back positive.  Originally, they thought about getting an abortion in order to take care of the problem after getting an advice from Sai but upon seeing the operation room, Natalie decided not to and ran out in horror. Despite her anxiety of this issue, she decides to go through with the pregnancy in complete support from Ka Fu, along with Bing and Sai. However, Natalie, being underage and about two years younger than Ka Fu, causes her parents, especially her father, to fly into a rage and a lawsuit gets under way for Ka Fu and his parents. Ka Fu's parents also scold him and express that they do not want him to make the same mistakes they did. Upon knowing her pregnancy, Natalie's father's plan was for her to get an abortion, and send her to the United States to continue with her education, which Natalie aggressively objected, and she scolded her father for always making decisions for her. Her father gets angry and canceled her bank account, internet services and her cell phone. He ordered his wife to be at home and watch over her 24/7.  Learning of the impending legal action, and also because of the plan on aborting the baby, Ka Fu and Natalie, with the help of Bing and Sai, run away and make out a living for themselves in the countryside, where Sai used to live. Ka Fu worked in various jobs such as construction to make money to support themselves while Natalie stays home. Because of Natalie's father, Ka Fu made the headlines, depicting him as a rapist that kidnapped Natalie. Therefore, making Ka Fu a wanted person. The young lovers are eventually discovered by Ka Fu's parents after they forced Bing and Sai to tell them. When Natalie goes into early labor, they are forced to return to the city, where she gives birth to a baby boy (prematurely, although the baby survives) and Ka Fu is arrested. During the court scene, the relationships of the parents and their son and daughter are resolved as Natalie's father decided to let it go for the sake of the baby. During court, he revealed that he gave false information to the police about Natalie being underage due to his anger and prejudice towards Ka Fu. He eventually realized that even though Ka Fu got his daughter pregnant, he did try to make up his responsibility as he truly loves Natalie so he asked the judge to release him. Ka Fu was also sentenced to 3 months in a rehabilitation center for his actions. Upon his release, he is greeted by Natalie and their child.

They all agree, except Tong Sam, a [[rice paddy|rice farmer]], as he is unable to give blood as he is sick. However, as Jin Ping's equipment is not safe, most of the people in the village contract [[HIV]] and die of [[AIDS]], including Tong Sam's family. The military men led by Xuan arrive in the village to help with the disease, and they help Tong Sam grow rice, which he then gives out to his remaining neighbors. Government officials arrive in the town to test people for AIDS, but the testing is $10 per person, which one neighbor thinks is a scam because it "cost $5 when she gave me the virus."  In [[Canada]], [[Pornographic film actor|porn star]] Denys thinks he may be [[HIV positive]]. He cheats his monthly blood tests by taking blood samples from his ailing father instead of providing his own blood. Eventually his father dies, and his mother Olive finds out her son's job, much to her dismay. Denys subsequently quits his job.

She asks for help from the plantation owner Hallyday, who makes sexual advances on her. Eventually she gives in and allows Hallyday to have sex with her, if he agrees to help the family she looks after. She eventually discovers that the older brother in the family is re-using the plantation's needles, effectively spreading infections amongst the people who live and work there. Following this, three men break into the nuns' bedroom and rape them. The nuns leave the plantation soon after, but as the car pulls away, Clara gets out and walks back to the plantation, removing her [[religious habit|habit]] as she goes.  The epilogue is narrated by Hilde, who is revealed to be a [[Saint]] and has heard the prayers of everyone from the three stories detailed above. She wonders why the human race will not unite in the face of their common enemy, AIDS, and decides that God, or at least the way people believe in him, is to blame for this failure.

The film exposes the spectrum of reaction to the Holocaust among the post-war generation in Germany. While Ludin confronts his father, and Germany's, guilt full-on, his sister Barbel continually refuses to concede the most basic points about the mass slaughter of millions of Jews by the Nazis.

The 9th Company
 At a farewell ceremony in [[Krasnoyarsk]], a band of young [[Soviet Army]] recruits is preparing for their departure to their place of military service. On arrival at their bootcamp in the [[Fergana Valley]] of [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbekistan]] they meet their drill instructor, Senior [[Warrant Officer|Praporschik]] Dygalo, a seasoned, traumatized veteran of several tours in Afghanistan and a brutal trainer who treats the recruits harshly and at one time suffers a nervous breakdown. During their training, the recruits overcome their differences and build bonds. Between the training sessions, they receive lessons in operating [[plastic explosive]]s (which prompts some comic relief) and how to conduct themselves in Afghanistan (underlining the vast cultural differences between Western and Afghan culture).  On their arrival at [[Bagram Airfield|Baghram air base]] they greet a group of [[Russian Airborne Troops|VDV]] troops who have fulfilled their military service and are due to return home. One of the departing soldiers gives one of the new arrivals, Lyutyi, a talisman that he claims has kept him safe through several tours and multiple firefights. Homeward bound, the departing soldier's transport plane is hit by enemy fire from the nearby mountains and crashes, giving the new recruits their first taste of war.  Shortly thereafter, the soldiers are assigned to the 9th company, where their trainer and drill instructor, Dygalo, had previously served. The company is soon deployed to the front as part of [[Operation Magistral]] and is instructed to hold a nameless hill at all costs. After some preliminary skirmishes, the company's position comes under sustained attack by a large number of [[Mujahedin]] fighters and is overrun. In the end, the company holds the hill until reinforcements arrive, by which time seemingly only Lyutyi is still alive.  
9 (2005 film)
 9 is a [[sentience|sentient]] [[rag doll]] who appears to be the last of his kind, living in the ruins of a decaying, [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] Earth. He is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse â a swinging [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] of [[scrap metal]], an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of [[tar]], though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing [[amulet|talisman]] which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback.  In the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor, 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire and a watch battery. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping.  Almost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the Cat Beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman, leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock.  9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. The Cat Beast follows and we see that it has not just taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment. The number 5 shows prominently on its back.  The Beast pounces on what it thinks is 9, but which turns out to be a marionette â the dummy created by 9 at the beginning of the film. The Beast's claws stick in the tar and 9 is able to hop onto its back and steal the Beast's talisman. 9 leads the Beast on a panicked chase through the house and finally runs out onto the end of a broken plank, which extends over a several-story drop. Thinking it has 9 cornered, the Beast walks out onto the plank. But it has fallen into 9's trap.  Nearby is the metal armature, and the upright book. 9 leaps off the plank onto the armature, which swings him around to the book. He kicks it and it falls into the pit. The string, tied at one end to the book, has its other end tied to the plank. The weight of the falling book drags the plank into the pit, and the Beast with it. The Beast crashes through a hole in the cellar floor and is presumably impaled by the sharp end of the falling plank. This all reveals that all the things that 9 has built was a cleverly-made trap for the Beast.  Now free from fear, 9 salvages the skins of the other rag dolls and prepares them to be ceremonially burned. As he looks sadly at the skin of 5, the two talismans begin to glow. 9 realizes that they are two halves of a whole and puts them together. A beam of green light erupts from the united talisman, and the [[spirit]]s of the eight slain rag dolls 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 emerge, returning to their rag doll skins to be at peace. Before disappearing, 5's soul turns to 9 and nods in approval.  In the morning, when the ashes have cooled, 9 â bearing the light bulb staff, a symbol of the persistent light of knowledge and learning â walks off into the wasteland, leaving the empty talisman behind in the sand.  
12 and Holding
 The film explores adolescent issues through the minds of three friends and their reactions after a boy named Rudy Carges (Conor Donovan) is killed in a tree house set on fire by local bullies Jeff and Kenny, who carelessly didn't find out he was inside until too late. The boy's twin brother Jacob, a boy with a huge birthmark (also played by Donovan), decides to seek revenge against the bullies. Leonard ([[Jesse Camacho]]) who's overweight, survives the tree house fire but loses his sense of taste and smell. Thanks to the fire, this prompts Leonard to go on a diet, which isn't welcomed by his [[obesity|obese]] family. The boys' female friend Malee ([[Zoe Weizenbaum]]) tries to befriend an adult named Gus ([[Jeremy Renner]]), a [[grief]]-stricken patient of her therapist mother, Carla ([[Annabella Sciorra]]). Jacob's family falls apart after the death of his brother. But shortly after, his parents adopt a boy named Keith Gardner. Meanwhile, Malee begins to have a crush on Gus and changes the song for her recital to one Gus liked, just for him. As time goes by, she sees Gus as her "soul mate". She sneaks into his house one night to find him grieving. Afraid to confront him, Malee steals his gun and leaves. She gives it to Jacob the following day.  Jacob's mother gets furious when she finds out Jeff and Kenny are being put in juvenile hall for only one year as they were charged with manslaughter instead of murder, while Jacob's father views Rudy's death as an accident. Jacob frequently visits Jeff and Kenny, and initially threatens them, until eventually Jeff commits suicide. Jacob befriends Kenny, soon learning he has an early release and is illegally moving to New Mexico. Meanwhile, Leonard's father decides to take his sisters to Florida instead of Leonard (who would usually go). Leonard decides to force his mother to lose weight by trapping her in the cellar. They both end up in the hospital after a [[gas leak]] in their home. Next, Jacob and Kenny agree that Jacob can go with him to New Mexico. Malee visits Gus and removes her clothes in an attempt to seduce him. Instead, Gus calls Malee's mother to come and pick her up. The next day, Gus explains to therapist Carla about the last fire he ever fought (which involved killing an injured little girl, upon the girl's request), claiming that Malee wanted him to take her pain away, as he was aware of her growing crush on him.  Meanwhile, Jacob's mother tells him that Keith Gardner wasn't adopted to replace Rudy, and that she wants Kenny dead, which reminds Jacob of his planned revenge. The night of escape for Jacob finally comes and he meets up with Kenny. Jacob insists on going through a construction site which he says is a secret route. Once there, Jacob points Gus's gun at Kenny, and tells him "you killed him" before shooting him dead. Jacob buries the body and leaves. He returns in the daytime, and sees Gus spreading cement above Kenny's grave.  Malee begins visiting her estranged father and Leonard's family finally starts eating healthily. The movie ends with Jacob's mother smiling at him from inside the house.

Cal advises Andy to simply "ask questions", which he practices on bookstore clerk Beth, who quickly becomes intrigued by him. David gives Andy his porn collection, encouraging him to [[masturbate]]. Mooj stresses to Andy the importance of love in a relationship.  Andy begins to socialize and form friendships with his co-workers. David, after running into his ex girlfriend Amy, has an emotional breakdown at work. Store manager Paula promotes Andy to fill in for him.  Jay attempts to quicken the process by tricking Andy into meeting a [[prostitution|prostitute]]. When Andy discovers the hooker is a male [[transvestism|transvestite]], he insists that his friends stop trying to help him. Andy lands a date with Trish Piedmont, a woman he met on the sales floor.  During Andy and Trish's first date, as they are about to have sex, they are interrupted by Trish's teenage daughter Marla. Trish suggests that they postpone having sex, to which Andy enthusiastically agrees.  Andy's friends begin to encounter the consequences of their lifestyles. David, obsessed with Amy, takes a vow of celibacy. Jay, who previously boasted of his promiscuity, gets into an argument with a customer after his girlfriend breaks up with him over his infidelity. Jay concedes to Andy that sex can ruin a relationship.  Andy and Trish's relationship grows. Trish encourages Andy's dream of starting a business, suggesting they fund it by selling his collectibles. Andy takes Marla to a group session at a [[sexual health clinic]], where she reveals she is a virgin. Andy, trying to defend her against derision, admits that he is also a virgin but is disbelieved and ridiculed. Marla later says that she knows Andy is a virgin, but agrees to let him tell Trish himself.  On the couple's 20th date, the limit they agreed for their abstinence, Andy is still resistant, which upsets Trish. Trish demands he explain his reticence, and Andy accuses her of trying to change him against his will. He leaves for a nightclub where he meets his friends, gets drunk and praises them for encouraging him to have sex. Andy runs into Beth and they soon leave for her apartment. Marla convinces Trish to make up with Andy. By this time Andy has sobered up and is having second thoughts. His friends arrive and encourage him to go back to Trish.  Andy returns to his apartment, where he finds Trish waiting for him. He attempts to apologize, but Trish, having found various suspicious items in his apartment, is now afraid that Andy may be some sort of sexual deviant. Andy tries to defend himself and declares his love for her, but she leaves in alarm and disgust. Andy chases after her on his bike, but collides with her car and flies through the side of a truck. Trish rushes to his side, and Andy finally confesses that he is a virgin as explanation for his behavior. Trish is surprised but relieved, and they kiss.  Later, Andy and Trish are married in a lavish ceremony with everyone in attendance, with a sidelong mention that Andy's action figures sold for over half a million dollars.

500 Years Later
 ''500 Years Later'' studies the [[African diaspora]] and the impact of slavery throughout history, identifying key issues facing the world's black communities, including poor education, poverty, crime, and the way that such issues dehumanize and degrade black peoples. The film also gives insight into the struggles faced by continental Africans today, for instance in terms of poverty, disease, and corrupt governments. While the continuing negative impact, influence and effects of the trans-Atlantic slave trade are highlighted, scholars interviewed for the film express hope that "old scars can be healed" and Africans as a race will advance through education about their history.<ref name="500 Years Later â MK Asante"></ref>  ===Narrative=== The film states that the lasting effects of slavery are still felt 500 years later, hence the title. This is justified and explained through a series of scholarly interviews throughout the film. The film begins with an adage that illustrates its historical theme: "Until lions tell their story, the tale of the hunt will always glorify the hunter."  The promotional page for the producer of the film describes it thusly: "''500 Years Later'' is a compelling journey, infused with the spirit and music of liberation, that chronicles the struggle of a people from enslavement who continue to fight for the most essential human right - freedom."<ref name="500 Years Later â MK Asante"/> The film presents the richness of African cultures and traditions and how they have evolved since slavery was abolished, emphasizing that prior to the beginning of the Atlantic Slave Trade Africans were free. The film includes testimonies, voices, and opinions gathered around five continents. Many of the people who voice their opinion are scholars or experts on the African diaspora.<ref></ref> Those interviewed in the film criticize contemporary rap music as being particularly negative for Africans and their descendants, as they believe it reinforced racist stereotypes that were established in part because of the slave trade.  A lasting example of the stereotypes referenced in the film is a study performed by [[Kenneth and Mamie Clark]] in which black children were given a variety of dolls, including black and white ones, and were told to pick the "smarter" or "better" one. A majority of the black children chose the white dolls. Many of those interviewed believe that a distinct change to the educational system is necessary to change the mindset of people of African descent. The film affirms that "the kind of education that we have is to still enslave our minds, to make us believe we are inferior."<ref name=NeoCopernicanReview /> Education should be the main weapon for the new generations of Africans and African descendants, to remind the world of the richness and struggle of African history.  At the end of the film, Africans are encouraged to remember their past, in order to move forward. The film promotes the idea that making it through enslavement should be a strength, not a weakness or something to be ashamed about; that the people who enslaved the Africans should be the ones that are ashamed. Essentially, the goal proposed is to teach African children a more Afrocentric history, instead of a Eurocentric one. It further argues that teaching African-descent people about a history that is not their own will not help because they cannot relate to it. It also indicates that society must establish and promote African ideas and history in order to preserve what they want for future generations. The film calls for the ideas promoted within it to become mainstream so that there can be a better Africa and a better history associated with the continent.<ref>''500 Years Later''.</ref>

The two left Max to guard Planet Drool. In reality, Max's parents have little time for him, and their marital relationship is not going well. Max is also bullied by fellow schoolmate Linus. However, he does receive friendship from Marissa, the daughter of his teacher Mr. Electricidad, whose name is Spanish for "electricity". After a chase, Linus steals Max's dream journal (where all of his most precious dreams are kept) and vandalizes it. The next day, as Max attempts to retaliate, twin tornadoes form outside the school. Sharkboy and Lavagirl emerge from the tornadoes and have Max accompany them to Planet Drool, which he learns is turning bad because of Mr. Electric, the dreamworld's now-corrupt [[electrician]].  They confront Mr. Electric, who drops them in the Dream Graveyard, where some of Max's dreams have been dumped. They find Tobor, a [[robot]] toy that Max never finished building in the real world after being discouraged by his father. Tobor gives them a lift to other parts of the planet. The three form a friendship during their journey, but they face hardships, such as Sharkboy's anger for the oceans being frozen over, and Lavagirl's desperation to find her true purpose on Planet Drool. They are pursued by Mr. Electric and his "plughounds" across the planet. They plan to visit the Ice Princess and obtain the Crystal Heart, which can freeze time, giving them enough time to get to the center of Planet Drool and fix the dreamworld using Max's daydreaming. However, they are captured by Mr. Electric, and delivered to Linus's Planet Drool incarnation Minus, who has altered the dreamworld with Max's own dream journal, and traps the three in a cage. Sharkboy gets annoyed by Minus and has a shark frenzy, destroying the cage. After they escape, Max retrieves the dream journal from Minus while he is sleeping.

After an encounter with the Ice Guardian, Max, Sharkboy, and Lavagirl reach the Ice Princess, the Planet Drool incarnation of Marissa Electricidad.

Mr. Electric fools Sharkboy into jumping into water filled with electric eels, seemingly killing him. Lavagirl also dies after jumping into the water to retrieve Sharkboy. Tobor appears and convinces Max to dream a better and unselfish dream, which in turn revives Sharkboy, who then races Lavagirl to a volcano to revive her. Max concludes that her purpose is as a light against the dark clouds which have engulfed Planet Drool's skies. Max gains reality warping as the Daydreamer and defeats Minus, then offers to make a better dreamworld between the two of them, to which Minus agrees.  Mr. Electric refuses to accept the new dreamworld, and flies to Earth to kill Max while he is dreaming. Max awakens back in his classroom during the tornado storm. Mr. Electric materializes, and Max's parents get sucked into the storm, but are saved by Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Max gives the Crystal Heart to Marissa so she can use the Ice Princess's powers to destroy Mr. Electric. Mr. Electricidad, Linus and Max make peace with one another, and Max reunites with his parents.

About Love
 In Tokyo, he is a Chinese computer graphic artist seeking to enrich his exposure while she is a Japanese painter struggling to recover from a broken relationship. This is the simplest and sweetest of the three stories, starting with hidden mutual attraction and ending in their first meeting. This is also the only one of the three stories with a "sub-plot" (a really glorified use of the term) of his friendship with two other art students, both girls, one Chinese and one Japanese.  In Taipei, she is a local girl suffering from a broken heart and he is a Japanese visitor she asks in the middle of the night to help putting up a wall unit. This is the only story with a scene of brief libido drive which, however, quickly subsides. The rest of the story is on his helping her by asking her ex-boyfriend whether there is a chance of getting back together. Among the three, this is the story that plays most on the language barrier thing, with some absolutely hilarious scenes resulting.  In Shanghai, he is a Japanese student renting a room from her mother. She probably has a crush on him at first sight but keeps it deeply hidden when she sees how devoted he is to his girlfriend. But when he gets a postcard from the girlfriend ending their relationship, her attraction to him intensifies, although she never reveals it. This is the most poignant of the three stories. Romance aside, this story also takes a quick jab at the maddening scene of urban development of Shanghai.  
Adam's Apples
 [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] gang leader Adam ([[Ulrich Thomsen]]) is granted parole from prison for participating in a rehabilitation program, where he joins the aggressive Saudi gas station robber Khalid (Ali Kazim) and the kleptomanic rapist Gunnar ([[Nicolas Bro]]). The community is headed by the priest Ivan ([[Mads Mikkelsen]]), who believes firmly and blindly in the goodness of man, and is seemingly oblivious to the ongoing misconduct and aggression of his charges.  Ivan tells Adam to choose a goal for himself to complete his rehabilitation. Trying to mock the priest, Adam chooses the goal of baking an apple pie. Ivan accepts, but stipulates that making the pie includes grooming and harvesting the churchyard apple tree. Adam is loath to complete his task, especially because at first crows attack the apples, and later most of those that remain are eaten by worms. The misanthropic Nazi is especially irritated by Ivan's joyful manner, excessive optimism and extreme forgiveness, and he sets it as his personal goal to break the priest's spirit and crush his faith.  Adam discovers that Ivan's life has been very difficult. Growing up as a victim of child abuse, he has terminal brain cancer, and is the widowed father of a severely disabled child. The cynical village doctor theorizes that Ivan discounts reality and sees all problems as tests from the devil, because his real life would be otherwise nearly impossible to bear. Adam psychologically attacks the priest by quoting the [[Book of Job]], reasoning that it is God who hates the priest, not the devil. Ivan finally breaks down and renounces his faith.  Adam is gleeful at first, but soon realizes that without Ivan's influence, Khalid and Gunnar revert quickly to their criminal habits, and starts realizing the positive impact the priest had made. When several members of Adam's neo-Nazi gang visit the church and confront Khalid for earlier having shot two of their members, Ivan comes out of the church and demands to be allowed to die in peace. A scuffle ensues and the leader of the neo-Nazis accidentally shoots the priest in the eye.  At the hospital, the doctor predicts Ivan will be dead by morning. Suddenly guilt-stricken, Adam stays up all night baking a tiny, one-apple pie for Ivan, using the single apple surviving the sequential mishaps that happened to the apple-tree throughout the film. When he arrives at the hospital, he finds that Ivan's bed is empty. He goes to find Ivan's doctor, who tells him that the priest is in the garden - the bullet that hit him has neatly removed the tumour that plagued him.  In an epilogue, Adam remains at the church as an assistant to Ivan, and Ivan and Adam welcome two similarly troubled men recently released from prison.

 In 2011, a deadly pathogenic virus has killed 99% of the Earth's population, forcing the survivors to regroup and scatter across the Earth.  404 years later, in late 2415, all of the survivors inhabit Bregna, a walled futuristic [[city-state]], which is ruled by a [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|congress of scientists]]. Although Bregna is largely an idyllic place in the destroyed Earth, people routinely disappear and the population has nightmares.  A skilled warrior, named Ãon Flux, is a member of the Monicans, an underground rebel organization who communicate through telepathy-enabling technology and are led by the Handler. After a mission to destroy a surveillance station, Ãon comes home to find her sister Una has been mistaken for a Monican and killed. When Ãon is sent on a mission to kill the government's leader, [[Trevor Goodchild]], she discovers that both she and the Monicans are being manipulated by council members in a secret coup.  Ãon questions the origins of everyone in Bregna, and in particular, her personal connection to Trevor. Everyone in Bregna is revealed to be a [[Clone (plant)#Organism cloning|clone]], grown from recycled [[DNA]]. With the dead constantly being reborn as new individuals and bearing partial memories of their previous lives, their troubling dreams have increased. Cloning was required because the antidote to the virus made humans infertile. Trevor's ongoing experiments were attempts to reverse the infertility. His ancestors had also worked on this problem. Ãon learns that she is a clone of the original Trevor's wife Katherine, and is the first "Katherine" clone in over 400 years.  One of Trevor's experiments, Una, was successful: she had become pregnant. However, in order to stay in power, Trevor's brother, Oren Goodchild, had her killed along with the other members of the experimental group. He ordered all of Trevor's research to be destroyed. In a confrontation with Trevor and Ãon, Oren reveals that nature has corrected the infertility problem and that some women are becoming pregnant. Oren has had them all killed to maintain the Goodchild reign. Ãon then goes against both her former allies, who want to kill Trevor, and Oren.  She convinces the other Monicans to ignore the Handler and to help her kill Oren and his men. Ãon goes to destroy the Relical, the [[dirigible]] that stores the DNA for cloning. There she meets Keeper, the old man who monitors everything. She discovers that he preserved Katherine's DNA for years, although Oren had ordered it to be destroyed so "Katherine" could not influence Trevor in any way. The dirigible crashes into the city wall, breaking it down to reveal the surrounding land for the first time in centuries. It is lush and fertile, not a wasteland as they were taught.

Then they find that the Wiki-Tiki is not really an evil spirit after all. They find the demons are just robots and the cave they are in is inside the [[volcano]] on the island. They also see the [[surfboard]] the Wiki-Tiki is using is a Goha Aloha-brand surfboard. Back at the island, it is only one day until the contest, and the locals are really scared something bad will happen. Little Jim blames the mayor for Snookie and Manu's disappearances, and says that whatever happens during the contest will be her fault as well.  The following day, Daphne enters the contest in hopes of capturing the Wiki-Tiki, whom they are sure will show up. Sure enough, it comes and scares the surfers and chases Shaggy and Scooby, until it was washed up by a wave. The gang unmasks the Wiki-Tiki, and find it to be Manu, who wanted to scare off both the locals and the tourists so he and Snookie (whose real name is revealed to be Pamela Waeawa) could buy up all (or at least ''most'') of the [[real estate]] on the island and then sell it back to the original owners at a big profit. [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]] also says that Snookie's an expert in [[Aerospace engineering|rocket science]] and [[robotics]], and created the "demons". Scooby wins the contest for the way he and Shaggy surfed while battling Manu. Manu expresses his shock and anger at losing the surfing contest to a dog as he and Snookie are arrested and taken to jail.   Later that night, the gang plus the mayor, Little Jim, Jared Moon, Ruben Laluna and Auntie Mahina enjoy a big luau at the hotel the gang was staying atâduring which Laluna informs them that the property bought up by Manu and Snookie will be returned to the original owners and Jared Moon tells Daphne that the Goha Aloha-company loved her designs and wants to buy them (he also gives her a free tiki charm). After Auntie Mahina thanks the gang for what they did, the mini-tikis come to the party and advanceâbut, instead of attacking people, they start dancing. It's revealed that Scooby has the remote control for them and he's the one making them dance. Everyone laughs while Scooby says his [[catchphrase]] before saying "Aloha!".

Her young teacher, Richard Powell, notices the change in her behavior.  The Bell family tells him about the strange occurrences and their fears that the cause is paranormal.

Am Ende der Distanz
 '''' centers on a man who roams the street night after night. Hidden under his hat and rain jacket he strives for one goal: to find the culprit- the one whom he can make responsible for his suffering. If he wanted to, he could confront him, but he lacks the audacity to do so. He considers suicide, but his courage fails him once again. The options do not appear to present him with a way out and would not personally satisfy him.  Finley blames not himself, but only others. In this case he looks to his girlfriend, Violet. He drowns Violet in the bath whilst giving her a massage, which had become a common ritual for them. On one hand he does this out of malice, on the other to be close to her just one more time. Through this action he wishes to break the growing distance he has come to feel between them, though the actual outcome is the infliction of the greatest possible loneliness, as he turns into a monster. Finley only realises with hindsight that his misdeeds far surpass those of Violet.  
The Amateurs
 Six friends come together to try to find fame and fortune by making the worldâs most innocent adult movie ever made. Although they have literally no idea what theyâre doing, they keep at it and are determined to accomplish their goal...no matter what gets in the way.    After the clueless crew finally completes the film, they screen it for the first time at the local bar. The brother of a girl whose scene ultimately was not used (besides some brief shots of her face) barges in, takes the reel off the projector, covers it in whiskey and sets it aflame.    It is revealed that this was the only print they had and that all their work has been lost. However, the cinematographer had been videotaping the entire production process on [[mini DV]] tapes. He then edits these down into a completely innocent documentary, minus the nudity and sex scenes, about the trials and tribulations of making (and then losing) their original film. This new version is released as the titular ''The Amateurs'' which becomes a critical and financial success on the independent film circuit.  
Always SanchÅme no YÅ«hi
  In 1958, with the impending completion of Tokyo's TV broadcasting tower as a symbol of Japan's escalating post-war economic recovery, rural schoolgirl Mutsuko (Maki Horikita) arrives from the provinces to begin her first job with Suzuki Auto. Initially impressed by meeting company "president" Norifumi Suzuki (Shinichi Tsutsumi), Mutsuko is shocked to discover her workplace is actually a shabby auto repair shop in Tokyo's down-at-heel Yuhi district.  Suzuki is a bad-tempered employer but Mutsuko is welcomed by his wife, Tomoe (Hiroko Yakushimaru), and their impish 5-year-old son, Ippei (Kazuki Koshimizu). One of Ippei's favorite haunts is a five-and-dime store managed by struggling serial writer Ryunosuke Chagawa (Hidetaka Yoshioka). Regarding now-successful writers like Nobel-prize winner Kenzaburo Oe, as overrated, Chagawa wants to be more than a hack churning out sci-fi yarns and selling cheap toys on the side.  When alluring newcomer Hiromi (Koyuki) opens a sake bar in the area, she gathers clientele quickly -- in dramatically compressed manga style -- but also finds herself lumbered with Junnosuke (Kenta Suga) the orphaned offspring of the bar's previous tenant. Drunk, and smitten by Hiromi, Chogawa accepts custodianship of the boy.  
The Amityville Horror (2005 film)
 In 1974, [[Ronald DeFeo Jr.]] murdered his family at their house at 112 Ocean Avenue in [[Amityville, New York]]. He claimed that he was persuaded to kill them by voices he heard in the house.   One year later, married couple [[George Lutz|George]] and [[Kathy Lutz]] move into the house along with Kathy's three children from a previous marriage, Billy, Michael, and Chelsea. The family soon begins experiencing paranormal events in the house. Chelsea claims that she has befriended a girl named Jodie, a name belonging to one of the murdered DeFeo children.  One night the couple decide to go out, and they hire a babysitter to watch the three kids. When the babysitter, Lisa, arrives, they come to find out that she had previously been hired to babysit for the DeFeos. Lisa tells them about the murders that took place in their house. When she goes to Chelsea's room, Chelsea tells her that she is a bad babysitter, claiming that Jodie told her so. Lisa begins to scold Jodie for being the reason behind her getting fired. Then Billy dares Lisa to go inside the closet (the same closet where Jodie was murdered), and she gets locked inside. After a few seconds she encounters Jodie herself, and begs to be let out. She goes into shock and the paramedics arrive to take her away; on the way to the hospital, Lisa tells Kathy that she had seen Jodie.  George's behavior towards Kathy and her children becomes abusive and the paranormal activity continues. Kathy asks priest Father Callaway ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) to bless the house, as a protective measure to prevent any future paranormal incidents, but Father Callaway flees the house when he encounters such occurrences himself. Kathy discovers that the house once belonged to a cult preacher named Reverend Jeremiah Ketcham, whose evil actions towards Native Americans during his "mission" in 17th century Amityville are said to be the cause of the haunting at 112 Ocean Avenue. Meanwhile, George, as he is walking through the basement of the house, encounters the apparitions of the various Native Americans who were tortured and killed there by Ketcham centuries ago. Entering a dimly-lit room, George encounters Ketcham himself (though he is not aware of who he is), and the ghostly figure of the evil missionary turns around, picks up a knife, and slits his throat in an act of recreating his suicide, covering George with blood, and causing him to become nearly completely possessed.  Kathy becomes convinced that George's abusive behavior is owed to a [[spiritual possession]]. Following urgent advice from Father Callaway, Kathy tries to evacuate her children from the house and escort them to safety, but the possessed George attempts to kill her and the children; Kathy knocks him out to prevent him from doing so and transports him away from the residence. Subsequently, George is released from the spirit's control and the family permanently leaves the house. A title card states that the family left within 28 days of arriving and never returned. Jodie is shown standing in the now empty house and screaming in terror while the house rearranges itself. Subsequently, she is pulled beneath the floor by a pair of disembodied hands.

American Visa
 The film begins with Mario on his way to [[La Paz]]. As the bus moves through the countryside, we see flashbacks of Mario's memories of his wife, and of his son, who lives in Miami. Mario tries to get a Visa of the United States in order to go there and visit his son, and eventually stay and live in that country. At first the process seems to go well. Mario gives his papers to the US embassy, where he is told that everything is in order and that he can return in a week to obtain his Visa.  Thinking the Visa is secured, he buys a ticket to Miami. Then, returning to the hotel where he is staying, he meets Blanca, an [[exotic dancer]], who lives there as well.  He tells her that he is going to the US to live with his son, but she tries to convince him to stay in Bolivia because she does not believe in the "American Dream." Nevertheless, despite their vastly different dreams, the two share an immediate attraction, and they quickly fall into a promising relationship.  After a week he returns to the embassy, and discovers his visa has been denied. An official tells him that he should say that he would not try to stay in the United States, which is something he can not do. Naturally Mario is angered, and he is forcibly removed from the office. Outside the embassy, a woman gives him the business card of a company that might help him with the visa. Visiting their office, he discovers that the company will charge him $5,000 for providing a visa. This is, of course, an amount that he does not have.  He continues his relationship with Blanca while thinking about the possibilities for getting the money. When he sells some gold to a woman in a shop, he thinks of a plan. For days he watches the store and follows the courier after the shop closes. He finds out that the owner of the shop has several businesses of the same type. After a time he decides to rob the owner in order to get the money he needs. Meanwhile, Blanca has fallen in love with him.  Eventually Don Mario breaks into the owner's home to rob him, but during the theft, Mario is discovered and in the ensuing fight with the owner, Mario strikes him, knocking him to the floor. At this, Mario thinks he has killed him, and returns to the hotel, lamenting what he has done.  The next day, Mario contacts the document broker and buys the visa.  He discovers that the US embassy official, a corrupt man without scruples, is the source of the visa.  After receiving the visa, he plans his visit to his son, but the man whom he assaulted has other plans, sending two of his workers to abduct him and rake him into the countryside to interrogate him.  When they realize that Mario no longer has the money, they give him a beating and throw him off a cliff.  Luck is with Mario, however. He is not killed, but is taken to a hospital, where he is reunited with Blanca.  After recovering, he postpones his plans to travel to Miami and goes with Blanca to visit her village.  
The American Ruling Class
 The film stars [[Lewis H. Lapham]], who plays himself as editor of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]''. Lapham opens the film with the question of whether or not America has a "ruling class," a circle of wealthy and powerful families that run the banks, businesses, and government, essentially controlling everything in America.   To answer this question, Lapham devises a fictional scenario following the post-graduation paths of two young [[Yale University|Yale]] graduates, themselves from opposite economic beginnings. The paths they take gradually clue them, and the audience, into the reality posed by the question.   Caton Burwell plays "Jack Bellami," a recent Yale graduate who comes from a rich family. Unlike his family or his friends, Jack seems unsure of what he wants to do with his life and wonders how he could make a difference in the world. Jack ultimately decides to become a banker, working at [[Goldman Sachs]]. He chooses the job after coming to the conclusion that the banking industry controls the world and that it would be easier and more effective to become a part of the system in order to change it from within.  Paul Cantagallo plays "Mike Vanzetti," another recent Yale graduate who is best friends with Jack Bellami. Unlike his friend, Mike is from a [[middle-class]] background, meaning he isn't wealthy like his friend Jack. Mike wants to change the world from outside the system. He decides to become a writer and goes headfirst into the character, renting a studio apartment and getting a job as a waiter. He refuses to "sell out" by way of writing for a major newspaper or by "pandering to the masses" by writing "lowest-common-denominator" material.  Mike's story takes center stage in the second half of the film, after Jack's decision to join Goldman and his subsequent success there. A run-in with Mike leads Jack to offer him a job at the company, an offer Mike initially rejects. As his student-loan bills start piling up, however, Mike begins to resent his lack of money and low-paying job, as well as the inability of his writing to enact change. Mike's girlfriend, Taylor, invites him to a wealthy friend's party, at which she encourages him to continue his work. A short time after the party, Lapham invites Mike to take a trip to a "space that used to be called, in another age of man, [[Mexico]]." This land was Texas. In Texas, Lapham shows Mike how the powerful control the government, and how money, in the end, trumps any effort by the non-wealthy to alter society.  Ultimately, Mike decides to abandon his writerly dream and takes up Jack's job offer. During a visit to Taylor's mansion home, Mike plays a game of tennis with his girlfriend and they discuss his decision. Taylor is horrified with his new [[defeatism|defeatist]] attitude. Mike lectures his girlfriend on his new worldview: that money is all that matters, and that, as society goes to hell, wealth is one's only defense against the routine abuses and corruption of the ruling class.  The film then splits with two endings. The first shows Mike during his first day as a banker, zooming in on him at an initiation program: His panic and displeasure are evident as he immediately regrets what he has done.  The second ending (which an on-screen graphic claims was filmed after test audiences reacted poorly to the first ending) has Mike sidetracked when he agrees to watch a stage show. It is being rehearsed by the lead singer of "THE WHATS?" and a group of children. The song they play discusses the themes of the film. The film ends with Mike in the woods, leaving the viewer in the dark on the question of whether Mike makes it to work or has his mind changed by the song.  
American Mormon
  Tufts and Knudsen, who also act as [[Film producer|producers]] of ''American Mormon'', were continually surprised and amused by the misconceptions many people appeared to share concerning the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]] faith. Believing this to be a fascinating and worthwhile subject matter for a documentary, the two men began traveling across the United States, armed with nothing more than a digital video camera and microphone.  ''American Mormon'' was shot in [[Washington D.C.]], [[New York City]], [[New Orleans]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Los Angeles]] and other locations. Tufts, on camera, approached random people. Upon their consent, Tufts interviewed these people, âman on the streetâ style with one objective: find out what people across the United States know about the [[Mormons]]. The goal was to approach subjects in a random and non-biased fashion. Tufts did not reveal to his subjects that he was LDS, nor did he tell them that they would be discussing the LDS faith, or Mormons, on camera. The idea was to get interviews that were not only honest, but spontaneously honest. The interviewees were not preached to. However, Tufts and Knudsen found themselves engaged with many people, off camera, who wanted to learn factual information about the LDS faith. After several weeks of traveling and shooting, Tufts and Knudsen began to compile the footage which would become a comedic cross-section of people from all over the country.<ref name="The Daily Herald">[http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/127830/ âFilmmaking duo finds out what average Americans really know about the LDS Church"] by Cody Clark, The Daily Herald, September 16, 2005</ref>

Andre is disgusted by what Angela is doing, and protests with her. Later, the two of them go to another club to pay off his remaining debt. Andre meets Pedro ([[Serge Riaboukine]]), and offers to repay him. Pedro advises Andre to bet the money on a horse, telling him that the [[Match fixing|race has been fixed]]. Angela advises him against it, but Andre bets all their money on the horse, which comes last.  Andre finds himself desperate again, whereupon Angela informs him that she is actually an [[angel]] sent to help him. Andre is incredulous at first, until Angela demonstrates she has divine powers, such as the ability to [[levitation|levitate]] objects. Andre is fascinated, and tries to learn as much as he can about Angela. The three thugs from the beginning of the film confront Andre; Andre asks Angela to take care of them, and she knocks them all unconscious. Angela helps Andre find the courage to see the good within himself, and also reveals that she did not have sex with any of the men in the bathroom or with Franck, rather she knocked them all unconscious.  Angela convinces Andre to confront Franck, and be honest with him instead of lying. Angela breaks into Franck's hotel room after knocking out his guards. Franck believes Andre is about to kill him, and pleads for his life. Andre apologizes to Franck for borrowing his money, stating he should not have done it. He then tells Franck of his love for the woman who came into his life and opened his eyes. Angela, who is emotionally moved by Andre's speech, leaves. Andre pursues her, eventually catching up to her on the bridge where they first met. Angela reveals that she is going home as her work as done. Andre pleads with her to stay, professing his love for her. An emotional Angela tries to reason with Andre, stating they cannot be together. She sprouts wings from her back, and begins to ascend, though Andre grabs hold of her. They crash into the Seine for the second time. Andre climbs out of the water and Angela climbs out after him. Angela has lost her wings, and she rejoices when she sees Andre.

Andre the Butcher
 Four junior college students (James "Jimbo", Cookie, Jasmine, and Kristy) are driving along a deserted road in Florida on their way to a cheerleading competition. As Jimbo is driving, Cookie gives him a blow job, while Jasmine secretly watches from the backseat. Distracted, Jimbo swerves and hits a utility pole, damaging the car. While looking for help, they find and enter a vacant house, which is actually home to Andre the Butcher, who is not presently there. Jimbo and Kristy decide to go back to the car and wait for help, while Cookie and Jasmine stay behind. Cookie confronts the closeted Jasmine and the two engage in lesbian sex.  Meanwhile, escaped convicts Tober and Hoss are seeking refuge. They enter Andre's house and find Cookie and Jasmine having sex. The convicts order them into the living room at gunpoint. While in the living room, Sheriff Cooper comes by and knocks on the door. Hoss orders Jasmine to answer it and get rid of him, threatening to kill Cookie if she doesn't comply. Sheriff Cooper enters the house and informs her of the escaped convicts and asks her if she's seen them. As she tries to quietly tell him that they are in the house, the Sheriff grabs Jasmine and begins to molest her with his baton. Hoss comes out of hiding and kicks the sheriff in the stomach, handcuffs him to the fridge, and leaves him there while they all drive away in his patrol car.  Jimbo and Kristy, while waiting by a tree, prepare to make out after Kristy reveals intimate feelings towards him. Andre the Butcher shows up and attacks them. He kills Kristy after luring her away and throws a knife at Jimbo, pinning him to a tree. Jimbo is rescued by Deputy Hollingsworth, who is looking for the escaped convicts, and they both head back to the lodge. As Tober, Hoss, Cookie, and Jasmine are driving away in the Sheriff's car, they encounter Andre on the road, blocking their path. After Tober tries to shoot him, Andre drags him out of the car and kills him. The other three run away and go back to the house. Jimbo also returns with Hollingsworth, who then handcuffs Hoss. Sheriff Cooper, still handcuffed in the kitchen demands she uncuff him, but Jasmine pleas with her not to. Suddenly, the television set turns on, which shows some of their sins: Kristy eats too much and Sheriff Cooper is corrupt. Andre shows up and murders the Sheriff. Hollingsworth shoots at Andre who runs away, but later returns and kills Jimbo and Cookie.  While in the basement, Jasmine discovers that Andre is not actually human, but something supernatural. Back in the 1950s, he was an ordinary man, had a wife and daughter and he owned a meat market in town. However, his wife and daughter were both killed in a tragic accident. This drove Andre insane. He began to murder his customers and sell their flesh as meat. The townspeople eventually caught on and lynched him. He was buried in a wooden box in a field near his house. His soul was sent to hell, but the devil elected him as his head recruiter on Earth. His duty was to murder sinners, whose souls would be sent to hell. Because he was never given a proper burial, the only way to destroy his demon form on Earth is to bless his grave, which will allow for redemption.  Hoss, Jasmine, and Hollingsworth flee the house with two jugs of holy water (blessed by Hoss, who is revealed to be a former priest), to find his grave and bless it. However, Andre pursues them and while running, the jugs break, spilling all the water. He kills Hollingsworth, and stabs both Hoss and Jasmine. Now without any water and seemingly defeated, they both crawl over to his grave, preparing to die together. Having to urinate, Hoss decides to use his own urine in place of water. Too weak to do it himself, he asks Jasmine to pull his penis out and aim for him. He urinates on the grave and blesses the urine, which works as holy water, killing Andre. The movie ends with Hoss and Jasmine apparently surviving, despite still badly wounded.  
Anniyan
 Ramanujam [[Iyengar]] alias ''Ambi'' is an orthodox [[Brahmin]] and a straightforward [[consumer protection]] advocate living in [[Triplicane]], [[Chennai]]. He expects everyone to follow the law and prosecutes those who violate it. However, his efforts fail as circumstantial evidence always seems to favour the accused. He also fails to raise civic awareness due to pervasive corruption and a general lack of seriousness. Frustrated at his inability to bring about a change in society, his suppressed anger manifests itself in an [[Alter ego|alter-ego]] named ''Anniyan'', a [[Death (personification)|grim reaper]]-themed serial killer who punishes corrupt and indifferent people. Anniyan creates a website, compiles a list of wrongdoers from his site, and kills them using punishments described in the [[Garuda Purana]]m, one of the ancient [[Hindu]] scriptures.  Ambi is secretly in love with his neighbour Nandini, an aspiring [[carnatic music|carnatic singer]], but never expresses his love due to his fear of rejection. When he proposes to her during the annual [[Tyagaraja Aradhana]] at [[Thiruvaiyaru]], she rejects him as she cannot bear his strict adherence to rules. Distraught, Ambi attempts suicide, almost drowning himself before having second thoughts. Subsequently, he develops another personality named ''Remo'', a fashion model. Nandini is smitten by Remo and falls in love with him. Their marriage is eventually fixed.  While purchasing a plot of land for her [[dowry]], Nandini decides to undervalue the property to evade [[stamped paper|stamp]] duty. Ambi, who accompanies her as she registered the property, refuses to help her. Later, when Nandini and Remo are on a date, Remo transforms into Anniyan and attempts to punish her for her corrupt act. As he is about to kill her, Nandini calls out for Ambi. Anniyan then reverts to Ambi, who collapses and loses consciousness. Nandini takes Ambi to [[National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences|NIMHANS]] where he is diagnosed with [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]]. Through [[recovered-memory therapy]], the chief psychiatrist of the hospital uncovers Ambi's past. It is revealed that, when Ambi was fourteen years old, he witnessed the accidental death of his younger sister Vidya due to civic apathy. The incident left a deep emotional scar, which is the reason for his lofty ideals. It is also discovered that while Anniyan and Remo are aware of Ambi as a separate person, Ambi is oblivious to their existence within him. The psychiatrist declares that Remo will cease to exist if Nandini accepts Ambi's love, but Anniyan will cease to exist only when the society reforms. Nandini accepts Ambi's love and Remo disappears.  Meanwhile, [[Superintendent of police (India)|DCP]] Prabhakar and [[Sub-inspector]] Chari, who is Ambi's friend, investigate the murders committed by Anniyan. In disguises, they discover clues left behind by Anniyan, which are the names of the punishments he meted out to his victims. Prabhakar is determined to bring Anniyan to justice as one of Anniyan's victims, Chockalingam, an errant catering contractor with the [[Indian Railways]], was his elder brother. In a dramatic publicity stunt, Anniyan admits to the murders he committed when he appears amidst the public and the press at the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium (Chennai)|Nehru Stadium]]. He explains the rationale behind them and says that only when every Indian is responsible and sincere will the country prosper on a par with developed nations. His methods draw both praise and criticism. Prabhakar tries to catch Anniyan, but he escapes.  On investigating the recorded footage, Prabhakar discovers that Anniyan is Ambi and arrests him. Ambi is brutally interrogated and almost killed, triggering Anniyan's reappearance. Ambi's personality alternates between Ambi and Anniyan, resulting in ambiguity. He subdues Prabhakar as Anniyan, but begs for mercy as Ambi. Using [[closed-circuit television|CCTV]], Chari secretly records the interrogation and uses it as evidence of Ambi's condition during his trial. Ambi is sentenced to [[psychotherapy]] in a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]] and will be eligible for release when cured.  When Ambi is released two years later, his rigid adherence to protocol has diminished. He marries Nandini. While travelling on a train during their [[honeymoon]], he notices a man (an electrician who was indirectly responsible for his sister's death several years ago) drinking amidst fellow passengers. Suffering a relapse, he transforms into Anniyan and throws the man off the train, killing him. However, he hides the incident from Nandini, indicating that he has successfully blended his personalities into one instead of eradicating them.

He has used ingenious methods to [[Money laundering|launder money]] legally, using dummy corporations that file lawsuits against firms outside France. Zimmer is also being pursued by the "White Collar Barons"âa powerful [[Russian mafia]] with whom he once did business. Zimmer is an elusive character, however, with no known description of his appearance following his recent plastic surgery. One standout detective named Akerman is getting close to catching the criminal mastermind; he knows that Zimmer will risk everything to reunite with the lover he left behind, Chiara Manzoni, who has not seen him since his plastic surgery.  Anticipating a reunion with Zimmer, Chiara arrives at a restaurant, where she receives a message from her boyfriend, telling her to "pick up" a stranger whose general appearance matches his own in order to mislead his pursuers. Chiara boards a [[TGV]] high-speed train and chooses FranÃ§ois Taillandier, a bland 38-year-old translator who reads detective novels and whose wife left him over six months ago. Fascinated by this beautiful mysterious woman, FranÃ§ois has difficulty concentrating on his yogurt and reading. When they arrive at [[Cannes]], Chiara invites FranÃ§ois to stay over with her at the [[Carlton Cannes|Carlton Hotel]]. She also gives him a watch that bears Zimmer's name on the back.  The next morning, FranÃ§ois wakes up alone and finds himself the target of two hitmen. He frantically escapes and seeks shelter at a nearby police station. There, he befriends Lt. Camel Driss, who provides him with clothes and a room at a nearby hospital. They discover that Chiara checked out of the Carlton Hotel that day. Driss believes FranÃ§ois' story after seeing a bullet hole in the hotel room, which is now occupied by members of the White Collar Barons and their leader, Nassaiev. Later that night, Driss is murdered.  When he sees Nassaiev and his goons outside his room, FranÃ§ois escapes and unexpectedly reunites with Chiara, who takes him to a secret hideout in [[Nice]]. There, she explains that she set him up because he matches Zimmer's build, and she tells him to stay in the hideout for a few days. The next day, however, FranÃ§ois leaves the hideout and stalks her outside the [[Hotel Negresco]], hoping to get more answers from her. Soon FranÃ§ois is nabbed by the police and interrogated by Akerman, who reveals to him that Chiara is in fact an undercover [[Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes|DGDDI]] agent. That night, Akerman secretly meets up with Chiara to discuss the rendezvous Zimmer proposed in a classified ad. Akerman tells her that while she will be at the rendezvous point, he will keep an eye on FranÃ§ois.  With FranÃ§ois in custody, Akerman and his men park their surveillance truck and post their snipers within the vicinity of the rendezvous point: Zimmer's old mansion. Chiara enters the mansion and confronts the White Collar Barons and Nassaiev, who threatens to kill her if Zimmer does not arrive within five minutes. FranÃ§ois leaves the truck and rushes into the mansion to save her, but is immediately placed on the ground at gunpoint by Nassaiev's men. After Nassaiev rejects her claims that FranÃ§ois is not Zimmer, Chiara gives the signal and the snipers shoot down the Russian mobsters.   As the police remove the Russian bodies from the scene, FranÃ§ois reveals to Chiara that he is, in fact, Anthony Zimmer. She tells him to flee, but Zimmer refuses, even though he knows Chiara is an agent. He opens a secret safe and takes out a notebook filled with his banking information, and leaves it by the front door for Akermanâhis way of giving up his life of crime for the woman he loves. Knowing what he's given up for her, Chiara decides not to reveal his true identity to the police, and the two drive away together.

Archangel (2005 film)
  An English expert on [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet history]], Dr. Christopher<ref>He reveals his name at the press conference for Josef.</ref> 'Fluke' Kelso ([[Daniel Craig]]), is in Moscow for a conference on [[Joseph Stalin]]. After the conference, Papu Rapava, an old man, says that he has important information for Dr. Kelso.  In [[Radisson Royal Hotel, Moscow|Hotel Ukraine]], where Kelso is staying, Rapava recounts in detail how he, as a young security guard in 1953, witnessed the death of Stalin. He saw [[Lavrentiy Beria]] steal a key from Stalin as he lay dying in his [[Kuntsevo Dacha|Middle dacha]]. Beria and Rapava drove to Stalin's private quarters in the [[Kremlin]] and Beria opened a safe. In the safe was a red folder which Beria removed and later placed in a metal tool box at his mansion. He instructed Rapava to dig a hole in the yard in which this box was buried.  Believing this folder to contain Stalin's notebook, Kelso sees this as an opportunity to write a book based on the personal writings of the late Soviet leader. He tells Rapava that it would be worth a lot of money and would help Rapava reconcile with his estranged daughter. Rapava leaves while Kelso's attention is elsewhere. The next day, a reporter called RJ O'Brian ([[Gabriel Macht]]) turns up and recognises Kelso.   Kelso begins his research in earnest, visiting a library to get information and eyewitness accounts of Stalin's death. He engages with a young librarian, Yelena, who provides him with the address where Beria used to live.  Kelso goes to Beria's former mansion, now in a state of disrepair. By accident, he discovers the key Beria took from Stalin. He finds the yard has already been excavated and the box is gone. He  visits Vladimir Mamantov (Lev Prygunov), a powerful politician (and former [[KGB]] agent) who leads the [[Communism|Communist]] ''Aurora'' movement. Kelso invites Mamantov to talk about the notebook, but Mamantov denies knowledge of it. Kelso leaves, unconvinced by Mamantov's denial. Soon Kelso becomes aware that he is being followed.   Coming across a matchbook in his hotel room, Kelso goes to the advertised night club. Again he meets O'Brian. Kelso has asked to speak with Rapava's daughter, Zinaida ([[Yekaterina Rednikova]]), who works as a high-class prostitute to fund her law studies. He asks to speak with her father again and, after Kelso agrees to pay for her assistance, she takes him to her father's apartment block.  Kelso finds Rapava murdered in the bathtub. As he is leaving, Kelso is mugged and beaten by hooligans. Despite Kelso's appeals for help from the police, he ends up being detained as a suspect. The [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] soon become involved as they are interested in what Kelso is doing. They arrange for him to be released without charge. The agent in charge, Suvorin, introduces himself, revealing that Kelso's actions led to the death of Rapava. Mamantov was aware of only one witness who knew about the notebook. Suvorin advises Kelso to leave Russia.  Zinaida tracks down Kelso. She found a note from her father telling her that Kelso has information for her. She tells him of their estrangement and asks why her father would contact her after so many years. When she says that she doesn't want to speak to her father, Kelso has to break the news to her that Rapava is dead. She takes Kelso to an old garage owned by her father in a search for more clues. Kelso finds a Makarov pistol and the tool box but before they can look inside, O'Brian turns up again. O'Brian wants a share of what they have found. In the tool box is the journal of a young woman called Anoushka from [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]], who was selected to work for high-ranking [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] officials in Moscow.  Zinaida translates Anoushka's writings and learns that the woman took care of Stalin. She writes of a different, humbler aspect to Stalin, different than the brutal dictatorial nature he demonstrated to others. One night she observes his cruelty when she sees that he forces officials to dance for him. After this, she voluntarily dances for Stalin.  Pages have been torn from the journal. O'Brian presses Kelso on the book's authenticity. Kelso is convinced it is genuine. Other papers found in the red folder contain reports from the [[NKVD]] and medical records. From other information known from that time, they conclude that Anoushka may have been the mother to an heir of Stalin. O'Brian deduces that the story continues in Archangel and makes plans for them to travel. When O'Brian leaves the room, Kelso and Zinaida plot to leave him behind and travel to Archangel together.   Zinaida plans a brief stop at her apartment to get her savings. An intruder waits inside but they make their escape and continue travelling north. Angered by their betrayal, O'Brian discusses his own travel plans with his colleague, Louise.  Suvorin confronts Mamantov about Rapava's murder at a book signing, but Mamantov has a watertight alibi. Suvorin's boss is outraged at O'Brian's breaking news report about Stalin's secret notebook. He orders Suvorin to talk with O'Brian.  Reaching Archangel, Kelso asks at the local records office about past party members. A male clerk, Tsarev, tells them that Anoushka's mother is still alive and living locally.  Kelso and Zinaida leave the records office, returning to their hotel. As they are getting closer, Kelso notices two [[Militsiya]] checking O'Brian's car and the pair are chased. Just before the police catch them, a car arrives and an assassin fatally shoots both policemen. Returning to the hotel unmolested, Kelso and Zinaida discover O'Brian waiting. Meanwhile, Suvorin is questioning Louise about O'Brian and she gives him the information he wants.  At the home of Anoushka's mother, the story continues to unfold. Anoushka returned home, pregnant, and two days after she gave birth, Anoushka died. Her baby boy was adopted by a local couple who lived in the forest.  In Moscow, Suvorin is again summoned to speak with his boss. Plans to have the military transport Suvorin to Archangel are under way. His boss cites the reasons for the importance of the notebook.  Kelso questions O'Brian about his sources and how he always seems to find them. Kelso appears suspicious of O'Brian's answer. When Zinaida comes out of the house to smoke a cigarette, she and Kelso discuss what they know. Zinaida agrees to remain with the mother so that Kelso and O'Brian can travel in order to find the child, now a man. Kelso also wants to keep an eye on O'Brian. The mother has revealed that her husband once tried to find his grandson. He left the house but never returned. Kelso and Zinaida believe that Anoushka met the same fate.  While the men are away, the local police arrive at the house and arrest Zinaida for murdering the two policemen. Before they arrest her, she manages to hide her father's [[Makarov pistol]] and some money.  Kelso and O'Brian begin their journey but fall foul of a road trap which stops the car. As they review their predicament, a man watches them from a nearby hill. Kelso is convinced the man is Josef, Stalin's son by Anoushka. They agree to go with him to prove they are not a threat to him.  Suvorin arrives by helicopter and gets an update from Lev, the local Militsiya captain. Suvorin examines the dead policmen and concludes that it was an execution carried out by a hitman and not a "call girl" or a "history professor"<ref>Translated by on screen captions.</ref> He asks to speak with Zinaida. Suvorin assures her that she will not be hurt by the Militsiya as he has established that she did not kill the two policemen.  At a remote cabin, Kelso and O'Brian are presented with a large suitcase. On opening it, they discover relics from the past that belonged to Stalin as well as identity papers of others who came before them. These people wrote confessions and died. An old man who chops logs for Josef, states that Josef's time is nearing.  Kelso asks Josef about his adoptive parents. The father, when drunk, would beat Josef. He died falling into one of his own traps while drunk and the mother was too old to work. Josef suggests that he killed the woman as a kindness. Kelso offers Josef a photograph of his birth mother but Josef says that he has picture of his real father and they are enough. Josef plies the men with vodka. In a menacing tone, Josef encourages Kelso and O'Brian to dance for him, just as his father did.  The next morning, Kelso awakes to discover Josef has gone. He and O'Brian make their way to the car to get a message out. Elsewhere, Suvorin is met by Major Kretov, with a squad of [[Spetsnaz|Russian Special Forces]]. Their mission is not immediately evident but Suvorin joins them.  Finally O'Brian manages to get a signal with his satellite communications device and he begins a broadcast from the forest. Kelso tries to stop him and they struggle. The special forces arrive at the cabin and kill the old man. Kretov is aware of the satellite transmission by O'Brian and he informs Suvorin.  Josef kills a guard left by the special forces transport. Soldiers capture Kelso and O'Brian and bring them to Kretov. Suvorin makes a move to protect the two men by threatening to kill Kretov. Kretov reveals that even if he is killed, his men will kill Kelso and O'Brian.  Suddenly, the group comes under attack from Josef. Suvorin orders Kelso and O'Brian to run for their lives. Suvorin accompanies them but Kretov shoots him in the back as they make their escape.  O'Brian is caught in a bear trap and Kelso helps him remove it. Kretov kills the limping O'Brian. Kelso falls into a nearby river and takes refuge under the dock. Kretov runs onto the dock and raises his weapon just as Josef shoots him. Kelso escapes in a small motorboat.  Back at the cabin, Josef shaves and dresses. His resemblance to his father is striking.  Kelso reaches a harbour and gets a lift in a truck to the mother's house. He learns that Zinaida is with the Militsiya. The old woman gives him Rapava's Makarov pistol. Kelso finds Zinaida at the police station. He pays Lev a huge bribe for her release. Kelso tells her that they must travel to the Kremlin because Mamantov wants Kelso alive.  En route to the train, they watch O'Brian's broadcast on a television set in front of a small crowd.  On the train, Kelso tells Zinaida that Mamantov wants a credible person to reveal Anoushka's notebook and the existence of Josef. He tells her that Papu Rapava died because he wanted Zinaida to have the wealth from the notebook to stop her prostitution. Kelso tells her they will go to the American embassy in Moscow and he invites her to go with him to New York. She confesses that her father never held or loved his children. He taught her and her brother to be tough, never show fear and only trust themselves.  As they settle down in a compartment for the rest of their journey, the assassin shows up and demands the notebook. He takes Kelso to see Mamantov. Mamantov explains how he planned for Kelso to come to Moscow to speak at the conference, discover the notebook and reveal Josef to Russia. Kelso believes Josef to be unstable and that Mamantov might be his first victim. A hand resting on Mamantov's shoulder is Josef's and Mamantov believes Josef supports him.  Back in the compartment, Kelso tells Zinaida about his meeting with Mamantov and that they must get off at Vologda, the next station. As they are pulling in to the station, a huge crowd is there to greet the arrival of Josef. Kelso tells her to go to Moscow and get on a plane to anywhere. He is going to authenticate the notebook for Mamantov. He meets Louise and tells her that O'Brian is dead.  Kelso wants her cameraman to broadcast his speech and he begins to expose the corruption of the people who want Josef to rule over Russia with the same brutality as his father. Henchmen of Mamantov interrupt him, kicking and beating him to the ground.  From above the crowd, Zinaida draws her father's Makarov and shoots Josef dead.

Assault on Precinct 13 (2005 film)
 New Yearâs Eve, and [[Detroit Police Department]]'s Sergeant Jake Roenick, veteran cop Jasper O'Shea and secretary Iris Ferry are the only people on site at the soon-to-be-closed Precinct 13. Roenick is deskbound and abusing alcohol and prescription drugs, haunted by a botched undercover operation eight months prior that resulted in the deaths of two members of his team.  Psychiatrist Alexandra Sabian is treating Roenick at the station.  Crime lord Marion Bishop is arrested when he kills an undercover police officer. Two Sheriffâs Department Deputies are transferring Bishop with three other criminals: addict ex-lawyer Beck, petty crook Anna, and counterfeiter Smiley. When a raging snowstorm shuts down the roads, the transport bus is directed to the nearby Precinct 13.  Masked gunmen cut off the Precinctâs communication, attack the station, kill the Deputies and demand Bishop be handed over to them. The lawmen believe the attackers are Bishopâs men. When they kill one of the attackers, they discover he is from a crew of undercover officers led by Captain Marcus Duvall. Rather than trying to avenge the cop that Bishop murdered, they are actually Bishopâs crooked partners in crime. Bishop balked when Duvall and his crew demanded a larger cut, so Duvall and his men (starting with the original dead cop) are trying to kill Bishop before he can testify about their involvement.  Heavily outnumbered and outgunned, Roenick sets free and arms the prisoners to bolster the defense of the station. Roenick and Bishop forge an uneasy truce between cops and criminals, as both groups know they will be killed by Duvall to protect his secret. Their combined efforts repel several more attacks.  Off-duty cop Capra, who has been partying and wants to make a move on Iris, returns to the station. Duvallâs men shoot at him, but he makes it into the Precinct. The criminals believe heâs a plant for Duvall, but Roenick vouches for him. With Capraâs vehicle outside the front door, Beck and Smiley secretly plan to make a break for it. At the same time, the rest of the defenders are also planning to use the vehicle, with Anna and Dr. Sabian volunteering to be the driver and âgunmanâ in an effort to get help. Beck and Smiley happen to sneak out first, both getting killed by Duvallâs men, inadvertently providing a distraction for Anna and Sabian to get away. Duvall had anticipated this and hidden Milos, his second in command, in the back seat. Milos kills Anna, then Duvall kills Sabian after she refuses to give intel on Precinct 13âs defenders.  With only five defenders left alive, Roenick and Bishop decide to take action instead of waiting for another attack. When someone inside unlocks the back door, they suspect Capra to be a mole for Duvall and put him in handcuffs.  The storm eases just enough to allow Duvall to call in some corrupt [[SWAT]] officers by helicopter, who land on the roof of Precinct 13. The defenders set fire to the station to cover their escape and flee through a utilities tunnel underneath the building. Emerging from the tunnel, they find themselves surrounded by the corrupt policemen. The real Duvall insider is revealed to be O'Shea, and Duvall prepares to execute the rest. Roenick and Bishop kill O'Shea, with Capra and Iris fleeing in Duvallâs vehicle in the confusion. When Milos shoots out their tires and moves in for the kill, Iris manages to kill him with his own knife.  Roenick and Bishop are chased into a small urban forest, where they work together to survive the final confrontation with Duvall and his remaining men. Duvall wounds both of them before Roenick finally manages to kill Duvall. Bishop, more mobile of the two, takes Roenickâs gun and flees, with Roenick promising to personally arrest him in the future. When Iris arrives with police, fire and medical services, Roenick claims that only he and the dead cops are present &ndash; giving Bishop a head start.  
Ark (2005 film)
 ''Ark'' takes place on a dying alien world in which a global war between two technologically advanced human civilizations has reduced the planet to a wasteland. The only way to escape the world is by activating the Ark, an ancient giant robot capable of supporting a human city as well as traveling through space.   [[James Woods]] plays Jallak, the military general of the reigning civilization, the Storrians, who captured the Ark from the Ceveans. But they are unable to get the Ark to work in order to save their people. The Ceveans, having been enslaved and with only the wasteland to roam free are constantly attacked and brutalised by the Storrians. A leader of their resistance movement is a young resistance fighter named Rogan. Rogan is arrested during a resistance uprising, but manages to escape. He bumps into the general's adopted daughter Amarinth, whom the general had secretly rescued from a Cevean hibernation pod cluster where they had hidden their children for safety. They then meet again during a civilian protest rally and she offers to help hide him and tend to his wounds. Rogan goes with her back to her apartment and meets her pet JuJu, but then vanishes when he discovers she's the Storrian general's daughter.  Baramanda, the Empress's manipulative right-hand man, arrives unexpectedly to take Amarinth into custody after discovering the truth of her lineage. Rogan helps her escape from Baramanda and takes her to the resistance base within the slave quarters of the Ark. There she meets with an elderly man who explains Amarinth's birthright with the help of JuJu, who turns out to have originally belonged to him. Unknown to Rogan, and to Amarinth herself, she turns out to be the daughter of the Cevean priestess who originally built the Ark, Amiel, who had disappeared 100 years earlier.  Amiel helped construct not just the Ark the Storrians hold, but another known as The Ark of York. The plans for the Arks passed down from the Gods (another alien race). It took all her strength to create them, causing her to fall into a deep sleep and not awaken again. Before entering her eternal hibernation, she placed her very young daughter into the hidden hibernation pod. Then her body was secretly hidden by her people until discovered by the Storrians.  They find Amiel's molecular structure enables her body to generate a pulsing electronic field throughout her bloodstream. Not only does this make her body perfectly preserved despite how long she had been inactive, it is the reason the Arks will not work: she and Amarinth are descendents of the gods themselves and only they have the ability to pilot the Arks. A cell of her dead blood can supply power to an entire building, but it becomes apparent that no matter how much energy Amiel's body retains, since she is dead it's not enough to move the ark.   Both civilizations scramble to use Amiel's daughter, Amarinth, to activate their Ark and leave the other civilization behind to die. However, Amarinth, who has ties to both civilizations, wishes to try to find a way to use her power to save everyone. She is opposed by the lifeforce-stealing wraith Baramanda, who wishes to steal the power of the Ark for his own selfish purposes.  Amarinth after going to the Ark of York, refuses to pilot it and leave the Storrians behind. Despite her lineage as a Cevean, she was raised as a Storrian. When she finds out her father, Jallak, had been arrested for high treason and was to be executed for hiding her, she demands that Rogan and the others help her rescue him if they want her help. They agree and return to save him.   After freeing Jallak, Baramunda tries to drain Amarith's blood but is stopped by Amiel who awakens momentarily to stop him. All escape but Jallak remains behind to save his people, as the Ark starts to fall apart. Rogan takes Amarinth back to The Ark of York as Baramanda merges with the core of the other Ark and awakens it. Amarinth discovers that, just as her mother Amiel died in constructing the Arks, so she would perish to pilot one. Rogan and Amarinth kiss for the first and final time as she merges with the core of York just as The Ark comes stomping up to it. The Arks clash in a giant battle with the earth breaking down beneath their feet. Amarinth grabs the city plate off of SidArk as Jallak and his friend set the self-destruct mechanism. They perish in the explosion as the planet begins to crumble.  Rogan narrates at the end as it shows The Ark of York kneeling with the SidArk city plate on another planet flourishing with vegetation. He states that no one knew both civilizations would make it and neither does anyone think it would work out, living together, sharing the planet. He continues saying that it was hard to imagine that their old world, which was now no more, might have looked like this before the war. So the Storrians and Ceveans are going to try to coexist, to preserve this planet and Amarinth's sacrifice. It's difficult at times, and Rogan wishes that Amarinth was there to bridge the gap between the two civilizations. He states that they could have learned so much from her, but that they already had.  
Asylum (2005 film)
 ''Asylum'' is set in Britain in the early 1950s. It tells the story of Stella Raphael (Natasha Richardson), the bored and unfulfilled wife of Max (Hugh Bonneville), a psychiatrist working at a remote mental asylum. Stella starts a passionate affair with Edgar (Marton Csokas), one of the patients. Edgar is particularly dangerous, having gruesomely murdered his wife in a jealous rage.   Not deterred by Edgar's violent past, Stella is beguiled by Edgar's passion and the affair intensifies. Although Max suspects nothing, Dr. Peter Cleave (Sir Ian McKellan) correctly guesses that the two are seeing each other. Cleave, who is fixated on Stella himself, attempts to get Edgar to admit to the affair â to no avail.  Edgar, who has been denied release, can take it no longer and breaks out of the asylum. Stella attempts to continue life without her lover, playing mother to her son, Charlie, and wife to Max. Around Christmas time, she receives a call from a friend of Edgar who arranges a rendezvous in [[London]]. The affair resumes with Stella using shopping trips as a pretext for her trips to the city. Edgar soon tires of the subterfuge â as well as sharing Stella's sexual attentions with Max â and demands that she choose to stay with him permanently or not return for another visit.  Shortly thereafter, Cleave confronts her, telling her that he knows that she has been going to London to see Edgar. After unsuccessfully attempting to bully Stella into revealing his whereabouts, Cleave reminds her that Max can have her committed to the hospital. Stella then runs away to join Edgar, and they begin a loose, somewhat [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] life together, remaining out of the public eye for fear of the police.   Soon, the lust of the relationship begins to wear off and Stella begins to see a darker side to Edgar's personality. He becomes obsessed with his work, to Stella's chagrin. He also starts to become aggressive and violent towards her, intensifying her fear of him. After shopping one day, Stella returns to the pair's squalid studio flat to be found by police and taken back to her husband and son. Her husband struggles to forgive her but accepts that their son needs a mother figure. Edgar observes Stella's capture from the shadows and flees.  Max, who has lost his position at the hospital, accepts a new job and moves the family to [[Wales]]. Stella struggles to settle back into "normal" life with her family, trying especially hard to make amends with her son. Edgar tracks her down and a brief meeting with him results in his capture. This sends Stella further into her depressed and distracted state.  On a school outing with Charlie some weeks later, Stella takes her son away from the class teacher and other children and they go into the woods together. Stella perches on a rock while Charlie searches for fish in the river. He suddenly loses his footing, falling into the river and begins to drown. Not noticing, Stella remains in a trance, not moving to help him. The class teacher arrives and attempts to help him, but Charlie is already dead. Stella is anguished over this and following this trauma, her husband and Dr. Cleave decide that she needs to be institutionalised. She is taken to the same asylum where she met Edgar. Unknown to Stella, Edgar is still held there. With the help of constant medication and care, Stella gets 'better', though she never fully recovers. She accepts Dr. Cleave's offer of a stable relationship, much to his delight, after he informs her that Max wants a divorce.  At the annual ball, where male and female patients are permitted to socialise, Stella is anxious to share a dance with Edgar and desperately looks forward to seeing him. Unknown to her, Dr. Cleave prohibits Edgar from attending the ball, gloating that he and Stella are to be married. Dr. Cleave later informs Stella that Edgar will not be attending.  As a nurse escorts patients back to their rooms, Stella sneaks off up a stairway leading to the roof.

Art of the Devil 2
 Two years ago, six school friends â Ta, Kim, Por, Tair, Noot, and Ko â were faced with a grudge. Ta's mother died when he was young, and his father remarried Ta's teacher, Miss Panor. Kim was his girlfriend (but is now dating Por). The boyish Tair and stylish Noot might be lovers (though this is never made clear), and Ko is their fun-loving friend.  During their last year at school, Miss Panor seduces Por (though this is not known to his friends). Por subsequently discovers he's not the only one in her bed. In addition to being married to Ta's father, Miss Panor is also having an affair with the sports coach. Fuelled by jealousy, Por suggests filming Panor and the coach to 'prove her infidelity' to Ta's father. The friends, save for Kim, do so, and broadcast it to the entire school. The coach soon discovers it was them and holds the group at gunpoint while he sexually abuses them.  Seeking revenge, the students approach a monk who agrees to curse the coach. A few days later, Por goes back to the monk and asks him to curse Miss Panor, too. The coach dies in which numerous fish hooks appear from his body. Miss Panor, who is embarrassed at her sexual exploits being revealed, is found stabbing herself repeatedly in the legs. She subsequently becomes a recluse, returning home to her cottage on the river, away from the city.  In the present, the six friends gather together after Ta's father commits suicide in order to head to the remote village and pay their respects to Miss Panor. Upon arrival at Panor's cottage on the river, Noot's cell phone rings; her uncle wants her to return because her father is in the hospital, so she makes her goodbyes and heads back to the city. Miss Panor is a polite hostess (if a little distant), and Ta's great-grandmother seems harmless enough, though he warns everyone that she is a bit senile. As the group stays at the cottage, Kim experiences some strange occurrences around it such as, the door moving on its own, a white figure appearing underwater, and seeing Ta's great-grandmother devouring a cat.  Miss Panor retires to a secret hut in the jungle, where she has several corpses gathered round, all of them sitting at desks, like students. Each corpse has a photo attached to it, indicating which former student it represents.  At dinner that night, as the friends eat the soup Panor has made for them, each student spits out something: Ko spits up a fingernail, Por spits up a piece of tongue with a piercing on it, Kim spits up an eye contact lens and Tair an eyeball. The group realizes that the meat, which is actually the dismembered body parts in the soup is, in fact, Noot. They search the cottage for Miss Panor. Kim finds a video camera with a tape that shows Miss Panor killing and cannibalizing the monk who cursed her, and then rushing towards the camera with a tree branch raised and bringing it down on whomever is holding the camera.  Tair begins to have hallucinations of corpses shambling around everywhere. The group flees the house and sees a light outside. They call to the boat for help, but it drives past them. The driver takes a fatal fall from the boat after seeing Miss Panor coming towards him from the other side, which sinks. Kim tumbles into the water and has a vision of Panor and Ta's father. In the vision, Panor is shown torturing Ta's father by ripping off his toenails, on the premise that if she hobbles him, he can't leave her. When Panor leaves the room, Ta's father shoots himself in the head. Kim relates this to the others, and they find the gun. In the same room, there are also some jars filled with pickled mangoes. In one of these jars, the group finds Ta's dead father.  The group runs to the house's dusty old shrine to hide and pray. Tair has a laughing fit and is temporarily possessed by Miss Panor. Ko threatens Tair with the gun, but suddenly starts to writhe and flail as dozens of salamanders claw their way out of his body, killing him.  The youths now decide to split up: Por and Ta go off into the jungle to find Panor, leaving Kim and Tair sitting outside the shrine, with Tair (now free of possession) still seeing visions of corpses. She panics and runs off, and Kim follows into the dense jungle. The boys hear Kim fall down. They run to find her, but are separated. Ta finds Kim and wrenches a piece of metal from her leg. Alone, Por has creepy visions of Panor. Ta leaves Kim to look for Por. Tair bursts from the jungle, cowering away from her visions. After seeing Kim as a walking corpse and in hysterics, Tair rips out her own eyes.  Por finds Kim, who appears to him as Miss Panor, taunting him about their love affair. Firing the gun at Kim, but Ta rescues her just in time. Por runs off into the jungle and discovers Panor chanting in her secret hut. Por flees, but a vision of Panor appears, hamstrings him, and starts pulling out his teeth; Por crawls away and confesses that he had a love spell placed on Panor causing her to seduce him, became jealous when he found out she was also sleeping with the coach and took part in filming them and then placing a pain-inducing curse on Panor as punishment. Suddenly, his vision clears and he sees Kim and Ta. Kim is repulsed by Por's confession; she and Ta leave Por in the jungle.  Miss Panor arrives, ties up Por, and takes him to her secret hut. She stabs him in the neck with a syringe full of a paralytic agent, then pours boiling water down his throat and slowly burns every inch of his skin with a blowtorch.  In the jungle, Ta is carrying Kim on his back. She begs him to continue without her, but he refuses. The two of them come across a small shrine, on which is hanging Noot's bag. Her cell phone rings: it's her uncle, wondering where she is.  In the secret jungle hut, Miss Panor is performing CPR on fatally burned Por in order to inflict more torture on him. Meanwhile, police officers converge outside the hut. As Miss Panor starts to use a power drill on Por's head, the officers break in and shoot her.  Kim is rushed to a hospital. She recovers, and Ta comes to visit her. As they chat, the TV in Kim's room broadcasts a news show, which reports that the five students who visited Miss Panor are dead. Also discovered in the secret hut was Ta's charred corpse.  In horror, Kim turns to see that Ta is actually a badly burned, walking corpse. He never went with them to visit Miss Panor; he was already dead by then. As he pets Kim's hand, Ta explains: the video of Panor eating the monk was taken by Ta's father, who had threatened divorce after witnessing the tape of her and the coach. For this, Panor tortured him and he killed himself. Panor locked Ta's great-grandmother in a closet and left her to starve. It was Ta's great-grandmother who had told Panor that in order to break the spells placed on her she had to kill the monk that was paid to perform them and eat his flesh. She also warned Panor that it could drive her insane (it does). It also becomes clear that the coach had also placed a love spell on Panor to instigate their affair just like Por did. Miss Panor was the victim of all these spells. Her attempt to free herself and seek revenge led her into insanity. She tortured Ta in all the ways that will be experienced by his friends. Ta's [[vengeful spirit]] had lured the group there so they could feel the pain that he went through. He only saved Kim from being killed because he still loves her.  A flashback of their days in school returned. Kim and a classmate had a crush on Ta. Kim makes a bet with her classmate that if Ta doesn't court Kim within a week, she will "offer" Ta to her. Kim was then seen with the monk who appeared earlier, who warns her, "Once you start, it will follow you till you die." She receives a clay doll and thanks the monk.  The film ends with Kim jumps out of the hospital window to her death, holding the clay doll. Ta's burnt form lies beside her declaring his love for her.

Athadu
 At a remote Dhaba in Atikapamala, 20&nbsp;km from Suryapet, [[Vijayawada]], a young boy named Nandu pulls out a gun and kills the local don, Vanka Suri. Fleeing to Old City, Hyderabad, Nandu is spotted by Sadhu ([[Rahul Dev]]), a local don who is impressed with Nandu and takes him under his wing. Sadhu and his gang plan to rob the local bank with the help of Nandu and a few other kids. The heist goes off smoothly, but Sadhu is betrayed to the police by one of his lieutenants, Narsing. At the local police station, the police beat up Sadhu, while the corrupt SI and Narsing divide the money between themselves. Nandu creates a distraction by causing a short circuit and escapes with Sadhu and another kid, Malli. Sadhu tells the two of them to run away and leave him, since the SI might find and kill them. Nandu calmly replies that he won't, because he has already killed the SI.  Years later, Nanda Gopal aka Nandu ([[Mahesh Babu]]), is a professional hitman for hire. He performs the hits with his partner Malli([[Sonu Sood]]), planning the escape. Nandu displays his proficiency with weapons as he kills Narsing, who has become a don himself and escapes with Malli. During a cabinet celebration hosted by the Chief Minister, opposition leader Shiva Reddy ([[Sayaji Shinde]]) plans to become the CM. He hatches a plan with his colleague Baji Reddy ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]): arrange a failed assassination attempt on him at the next party meeting, which will ensure that he will get votes through sympathy. His aide Farooq ([[Posani Krishna Murali]]), says that such a thing is possible,  but will cost a lot of money. He hires Nandu to do the job for 1.5 crore rupees. After receiving the payment, Nandu and Malli plan the assassination attempt at the party meeting.  They choose a nearby building to hide and a car to escape in once it is done. However, before Nandu can shoot Shiva Reddy, someone else fatally shoots him. Within minutes, police surround the building and Nandu tries to escape, but the car that Malli is driving collides with a truck and explodes, killing him. With no way left, Nandu does a daring jump off a building and onto a train. In one of the compartments,  he meets Pardhasaradhi a.k.a. Pardhu ([[Rajiv Kanakala]]). Pardhu reveals that he ran away from his village Basarlapudi when he was young and explains that he is finally returning to his village after 12 years. Later that same evening, the police arrive at Gudivada, where the train is running 20 minutes late.  The SI of the search party spots the back of Nandu and shoots at him, but Pardhu accidentally comes in the way and is shot instead. Nandu manages to escape and heads for Basarlapudi to inform Pardhu's family about his death.  However, after meeting with Pardhu's family, Nandu is unable to tell the truth and masquerades as Pardhu. Thinking that Nandu is Pardhu, Pardhu's family accepts Nandu into their family. Pardhu's cousin Poori ([[Trisha Krishnan]]), is instantly smitten with Nandu and tries constantly to get his attention.  Meanwhile, Nandu comes to know of the family's troubles and solves many of them,  while disclosing his identity to Pardhu's closest friend,  Ramana ([[Sunil (actor)|Sunil]]).  Meanwhile,  CBI officer Anjaneya Prasad ([[Prakash Raj]]) is handed the case of Shiva Reddy's murder.  Investigating the crime scene, he notes three things wrong with it: the bullet was not fired from the murder weapon, the police surrounded the building immediately after the shot, as if they were tipped off and that the bullet would not hit Shiva Reddy on the center of the forehead from that angle. Probing further,  he comes to Basarlapudi to meet Nandu, under the suspicion that he may be the killer. Prasad interrogates Nandu and tries to get his fingerprints, but Nandu outsmarts him by taking back the card on which the [[fingerprint powder]] was sprinkled. Soon the clues lead to Malli, but it is known that he is dead in that car accident. But shockingly, the petrol tanker which caused the accident was also hired by Malli.  Left with no other way, Prasad interrogates Sadhu, who has been in prison for few years. Sadhu confirms that the murder was not done by Malli, but by Nandu. He discloses the method of payment as being through banks. Prasad does so and finds that a cheque from Nandu's bank for 10 lakhs was encashed by Pardhu's grandfather Satya Narayana Murthy ([[Nassar]]) for Poori's sister's marriage. He calls the house and tricks Nandu into responding to his real name. Nandu escapes, but Prasad breaks the news of Pardhu's death to the family and Nandu's real identity. Nandu comes back, amidst outrage from the other family members for his betrayal, and reveals the truth behind his masquerade. Murthy then takes Nandu into his study, where he acknowledges Nandu as his grandson Pardhu. He gives him a gun to seek out the actual killer. He is explained earlier that Pardhu's father's death was caused by the gun backfiring on him when he went hunting, due to a rock being lodged inside the barrel. Nandu calls up Baji Reddy, threatening that he had recorded the prior conversation on tape and that he would send it to the CBI if he didn't reveal who the real killer was. Baji Reddy reveals the killer as none other than Malli, who had in fact faked his death by paying off someone to drive the getaway car instead of him. It is also revealed that he shot Shiva Reddy dead on Baji Reddy's orders from the floor below and tipped off the cops. Nandu then reveals that he did not record the earlier conversation, but he has recorded the current one. En route to Malli's location, Prasad spots him, but his assistant Ravi ([[Ravi Prakash]]) fires at him but misses. Nandu escapes, but Prasad forces Ravi at gunpoint as to who hired him.  Nandu then finally meets up with Malli, who reveals that he was tired of splitting the money from the hits between them, and he was offered 2.5 crores for killing Shiva Reddy and trapping Nandu for murder. The two are ambushed by a team of police led by the same SI who shot at Nandu, hoping to recover the tape. Nandu dispatches the cops one by one, then fights with Malli. Malli gets the advantage by grabbing Nandu's gun and points it at Nandu. As he pulls the trigger, the bullet backfires and kills Malli, revealing that there was a marble stuck inside the barrel, which belonged to one of the kids from Pardhu's family. Prasad arrives at the location and is given the tape by Nandu. Later, due to getting sympathy votes, Shiva Reddy's party wins, and Baji Reddy is in line to become the CM. However, Prasad meets with him and reveals he has the tape. Baji Reddy mockingly says that the tape won't count in court as evidence, but Prasad says that Shiva Reddy's son Pratap Reddy ([[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]]), who is bent on getting revenge for his father's death, will kill him when he hears the tape anyway. Trapped, Baji Reddy commits suicide.  Later Prasad meets up with Nandu, who is paying his final respects to Pardhu. Prasad says that the person who killed Shiva Reddy was killed in an accident, and the person who hired him committed suicide, leaving him. He then addresses Nandu as Pardhu,  allowing Nandu to go back to Basarlapudi to Pardhu's family.

Attack of the Sabretooth
 On a remote island, a Primal Park security guard enters a locked restricted area, where a [[sabre-tooth cat]] kills him.  As Alan performs an inspection, Niles takes his ex-brother-in-law Grant and Autumn to a hotel where other investors are waiting. Security guards Savannah and Sundip ignore an alert on a gate, but Alan insists on checking it. College students Kirk, Alaina, Robbie, Alys, and Collette arrive to complete a scavenger hunt, and Niles takes them to the hotel.  After reporting an open gate, Alan finds the dead guard, and a sabretooth kills him. Sundip radios Savannah to let her know about the breach. As the students break into a shopping center complex, Savannah learns the cats have not returned to their pens. After Niles' pitch to investors, Savannah recommends to him they shut down the park, but he refuses. Kirk and Robbie set off an alarm. When Robbie and Alys hack into the computer system to turn it off, they accidentally release all the sabretooths.  Sundip discovers the dead guards, but is unable to contact Savannah because the security system is down. A sabretooth kills him as he hunts it.  The students split up to find their objects. Savannah and Brian discover the power is out and the cats have free run of the island. Brian meets up with Sachariah in the park area, where Sachariah lets him know he was able to get the cats back in their pens.  As the students locate their objects, Brian and Savannah fail to get the system back up.  Niles takes Grant and the other investors to the shopping area, and the students split up to avoid being caught.  As Brian works on the main switch board, a sabretooth kills Alaina.  Robbie hears her screams, runs to help, but is too late; he flees to the lab.  Sachariah tells Savannah the cats are loose because of the power failure, and she decides to kill them despite Sachariah's objections.  Brian finds Alys and Collette, who tell him there are two more kids to find.  When Autumn complains of feeling ill, Niles takes her and Grant to his office.  Niles reveals to Grant the planned zoo will feature a mated pair of nearly 800&nbsp;lbs sabretooth cats, but Niles refuses to allow Grant, who doubts he has the cats, to invest.  Once Niles leaves, Autumn cracks his safe and steals his research.  Brian and the girls arrive in the lab and find Robbie.  Savannah finally reaches Brian on the radio, but the transmissions are too garbled to understand.  While Brian leads the students to safety, they run into the female sabretooth.  After hiding the students in a nearby room, Brian uses himself as bait, lures the cat into the lab, and kills it via an explosion.  Brian tells the students there is another, larger male still on the loose.  As Kirk and a drunk, female investor make out, the male sabretooth tiger kills her; Kirk runs off.  Brian and the kids run into Sachariah, who reveals there are three cats total, not two.  The third one, which Niles kept secret, is one ton and can only move around by dragging itself.  He also reveals that all three cats are [[bulimic]], which means they must constantly eat.  When Savannah tells Niles about Alaina's death, he blows it off, and she leaves angrily.  Back in the complex, Robbie offers to fix the system if they can get to the control center.  Niles orders Brian to find and save the cats, but Brian refuses.  The male sabretooth kills Kirk before Brian shoots it.  As Robbie fixes the system, the male cat kills Sacharaiah.  Savannah warns the investors to leave.  In the park, a cat kills Grant, but Autumn does not notice.  As Brian tracks the male's blood trail, Savannah finds the deformed cat.  Niles attacks her, but he flees when the cat approaches, only to be accidentally killed by a sabretooth cat model.  Savannah kills the deformed cat as Brian arrives.  He tells her he shot the other cat and that it probably crawled off to die.  They get the students and leave, while the male cat kills Autumn.  
Azumi 2: Death or Love
 Azumi and her only remaining colleague Nagara find themselves hunted by ninjas hired by General Kanbei for the assassinations they have carried out. One of which is the killing of his master. They hid temporarily in a temple so Nagara can heal his wounds sustained from their recent encounter. Azumi comes across some bandits led by Ginkaku, a young bandit who bears a striking resemblance to Azumi's former friend (and love interest) Nachi. Later, Azumi and Nagara are found by the allied ninjas working for the priest Tenkai, upon whose orders the assassins initially began their mission. After discussing it with Tenkai, Azumi and Nagara leave to seek out their final target, [[Sanada Masayuki]]. On their mission they are accompanied by a squad of government ninja, among them a young woman named Kozue.  Meanwhile, Kanbei Inoue assembles a large force of mercenary soldiers, ninja and bandits to try to avenge the death of his master [[Kiyomasa Kato]]. Amongst them are Ginkaku and his brother, Kinkaku. Azumi and the others then return to Ginkaku's village, where they are looked upon with distaste for their occupation. Azumi is torn by her attachment to Ginkaku, but on Nagara's urging they separate paths.  While travelling, Kozue convinces Nagara that Azumi no longer wishes to fulfill her mission and should be talked out of it. Nagara tells Azumi he is fed up and wants to start a new life with Kozue, and that Azumi should go and live with Ginkaku, and they part ways. Azumi, still intent on carrying out the mission, attempts to locate Masayuki in his mountain temple, only to discover he has left with his army to kill Gessai. He and his entourage have departed for safety, but are soon tracked down by the brutal giant Roppa (a character similar to the ''[[Ninja Scroll]]'' character Tessai), a member of the dangerous Uenokagashu ninja clan working for Masayuki. Most of Gessai's guards are killed until Azumi arrives, as do Ginkaku and his brethren who had been following her. Roppa is killed (by his own weapon), as are Kinkaku, several of Ginkaku's band and most of Kasumi's ninja squad.  Meanwhile, once Nagara and Kozue are alone, Kozue reveals herself to be a spy for the Uenokagashu clan and kills Nagara. Coming across Azumi later, she tells her that she and Nagara were separated, but when she attempts to kill Gessai, they fight and Kozue is killed by Azumi. Azumi then states she will go after Masayuki alone. Soon she comes upon the enemy ninja named Tsuchigumo, whose weapon are razor-sharp poisoned wires. Azumi manages to cause his wires to rebound back at him and he is sliced apart, but Azumi is cut and falls into a paralytic sleep. Sanada's concubine and the true leader of Uenokagashu ninja clan, Kunio, steps out of hiding to tell Azumi she feels that Azumi, who has killed so many, knows nothing of life. With the poison incapacitating Azumi, it soon came to a finishing blow, but Ginkaku appears, taking the fatal thrust and in the process mortally injuring Kunio. Ginkaku managed to dampen the poison's effect upon Azumi, shortly before dying. Kunio makes her way back to her camp, only to die in Sanada's arms.  Shortly after this, Azumi appears on a hill in the distance. Fighting her way through many of Sanada's troops, she is met by the man she intends to kill.

He has contested thrice against Ayyadurai in the past 10 years with no avail. He has made around 20 attempts on Ayyadurai's life without any success. Meanwhile, Selvi proposes her love to Chelladurai, but he does not accept, saying that it might result in clashes between their families, as they both belong to different castes. Also, there comes a flashback where it is shown that Chelladuraiâs marriage with [[Malavika]] got cancelled a few years back as she eloped with her lover on the day of marriage, which made Chelladurai feel embarrassed, and he preferred to stay unmarried.

He sends police on the day of marriage, saying that Selvi is still a minor and it is illegal to get her married before 18 years of age. Ayyadurai accepts that and informs Madasami to postpone the wedding. This angers Madasami, and he believes the police were sent only by Ayyadurai to cancel the marriage, as both of them belonged to different castes. Karuppasami uses this opportunity to get close to Madasami, and makes him the evidence for the murder of his father a few years back by Ayyadurai. The police arrests Ayyadurai. The general election dates are announced in the state. The ruling party again gives chance for Karuppasamy to contest, giving him an ultimatum to win. Ayyadurai can't contest due to the murder case, and hence he nominates Chelladurai in his stead. Karuppasami plans to murder Madasami and blame Chelladurai for that so that Karupasami can get both caste votes and win the election. But before that, Chelladurai saves Madasamy. Chelladurai gives his signed withdrawal form to Karuppasamy and says that let him become the unopposed MLA, as he is also a good-natured man, and his anger is only on Ayyadurai and not on the people of the town. Karupasami realizes his mistake and apologizes to Ayyadurai and Chelladurai for all his criminal activities. But Ayyadurai prefers to stay in prison as he still feels guilty of murdering Karupasamiâs father years ago. Karuppasamy becomes the MLA, and Chelladurai and Selvi get married to each other.

Rockwood also informs Puloski that his contract will not be renewed, which means that Puloski will be forced to retire in two months. At the same time, Rockwood is in the midst of selling his company to the very wealthy Gloria Beaumont ([[Kirstie Alley]]). Without the funds for a proper remodeling, Puloski decides to allow a group of prisoners, Mile-Away ([[Phil LaMarr]]), Next-Week ([[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]]), Jerk-Off ([[Marty Belafsky]]), and Ears (Joe Nipote), to leave the prison to burgle a sporting goods store owned by Rockwood (on the condition that they are "back by midnight" before the guard Smitty ([[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]]) makes his rounds).  The plan meets many surprises however, complicating Jake's plan, including excitable store clerk Lance (Kevin West) and a sadistic security guard ([[Gilbert Gottfried]]) with his vicious guard dog named Princess.  As Jake distracts Smitty, the four prisoners break into the store, distract the store's guard dog Princess with the prison's guard dog whom they had fed [[sildenafil|viagra]] to earlier that night, and make off with their stolen gym equipment, but on the way back to the prison one of their truck tires goes flat. As Ears and Jerk-Off look for a tire jack in a farm house, Next-Week and Mile-Away try to fast-talk their way past Sheriff Jack Hubbard ([[Harland Williams]]), who it turns out is an old school chum of Mile-Away. Jerk-Off finds love with the farmer's sheep, alerting farmer Baxter ([[Blake Clark]]), who comes out with a shotgun, sending Jerk-Off and Ears running away with no tire jack. As Sheriff Jack Hubbard and Mile-Away reminisce, Next-Week changes the truck tire with the tire jack Sheriff Hubbard loaned them. After picking up Ears and Jerk-Off from the side of the road, the four head back to the prison.  The next morning, the store security guard discovers that all the equipment has been stolen, and his beloved dog Princess was "a slut". Sheriff Hubbard inspects the crime scene, promising Rockwood that he will catch the culprits. The security guard informs them that one of the security cameras was still operational and they may have footage of the culprits; however it has only footage of the two guard dogs.  At the prison, the convicts are ecstatic with their new equipment and Jake feels very proud of himself. The burglars tell Jake that they think they should get the other items the prison needs by robbing the other stores owned by Rockwood in the area, justifying it because Rockwood had been fiddling with their budget in the first place. Jake agrees to the plan since he has only two months left of his contract.  As Jake distracts Smitty at the strip clubs, Ears, Jerk-Off, Mile-Away, and Next-Week rob Rockwood's other stores of their cash to pay for the renovations to the prison. Rockwood meets with Mrs. Beaumont to discuss their merger, while Mrs. Beaumont's pet monkey makes quick work of destroying Rockwood's office.  Jake throws a Valentine's dance at the prison, inviting the wives and girlfriends of the convicts, where Next-Week introduces his girlfriend (Lisa Arturo) and her friend Veronica ([[Yeardley Smith]]) to his cousin Carlos ([[Jsu Garcia]]). Veronica figures out that the convicts stole money from Rockwood to afford all the changes to the prison and Carlos has to kiss her to keep her quiet. Inside the dance, a riot breaks out due to another inmate stealing Jerk-Off's inflatable date, resulting in a scuffle, and a fistfight between the inmates.  At the police station, Sheriff Hubbard discovers that a shoe left by Jerk-Off at the farm belongs to a prisoner uniform at Rockwood's prison. He visits Mile-Away and after a scene of interrogation Sheriff Hubbard leaves. Mile-Away warns Jake and tells him to spread the word that there will be no more burglary jobs. Rockwood, however, has other plans. Along with Sheriff Hubbard, he creates a trap for the burglars in the form of a big weekend sale. The convicts read about it and decide to pull one last job to have some cash for themselves once they re-enter society. But Carlos demands to be a part of the job because he had to kiss Veronica to keep her quiet, leaving Jerk-Off out.  At the store, Ears drills into the safe but Next-Week mistakenly leaves his cousin Carlos to roam. Carlos breaks into jewelry cases trying to take them but trips the alarm. Upon opening the safe, they find it is empty, then run outside and are caught by Sheriff Hubbard and the rest of the police department. Mile-Away escapes in the van to warn Jake. Mile-Away admits that they pulled one last job and Jake admits that Rockwood was firing him.  Jerk-Off and Mile-Away enter the sheriff's department disguised as guards and manage to free Ears, Carlos, and Next-Week, escaping in the prison van, and entering a high-speed chase with Mile-Away riding with Sheriff Hubbard chasing the other burglars.  Jake shows up at Rockwood's house trying to confess to the masterminding the burglaries but Sheriff Hubbard calls Rockwood from the road, hot on the burglars' trail. Rockwood decides to chase down the burglars himself. Rockwood grabs a gun and has Jake ride with him, who are joined by Mrs. Beaumont, who has an odd attraction to criminals and high speed chases.  The chase ends at the prison where Ears, Jerk-Off, Next-Week, and Carlos zoom through the gate pretending to be prison laundry returning. Rockwood follows them in and notices the changes to the prison and realizes Jake masterminded the robberies. Rockwood says he will turn Jake in until Mrs. Beaumont comes into the prison and tells Rockwood how much she loves how well he treats the prisoners. Mrs. Beaumont says after seeing how he runs his prisons she definitely wants to merge her company with his and have Jake oversee all the prisons. Jake agrees and tells his gang that they need to stop the robberies permanently.  A year later Jake narrates, saying he retired and finally took the fishing trip he and Smitty had always talked about. Carlos and Next-Week were released first and were greeted by their women Veronica and Next-Week's girlfriend. Ears was released and led a decent life until he cheated on a game show using his super hearing and won a million dollars. Jerk-Off was married to his inflatable girlfriend and started a family; they had an inflatable baby boy. Mile-Away became Sheriff Hubbard's deputy and they became a great crime fighting duo.

Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus
 In a magical kingdom, the Queen wants to surprise her daughter, Princess Annika, with a birthday gift. When she opens the door to Annika's room, she discovers that Annika is missing, having gone to an ice rink without asking for permission. Out skating, Annika meets a small polar bear whom she names Shiver. When Annika returns to the palace, her parents are so worried and overprotective they forbid her from skating ever again.  That night, Annika sneaks out of the palace to join a festival. A powerful wizard named Wenlock appears and asks the princess to marry him. When Annika refuses, Wenlock furiously tells the king and queen the fate of their "other daughter," which surprises Annika. Wenlock magically turns everyone into stone, but Annika is saved by Brietta, a flying horse. Wenlock tells her that she has three days to marry him, otherwise the spell will be permanent.  Brietta takes Annika to a castle in the clouds called the Cloud Kingdom. There Annika discovers that "the other daughter" of the king and queen is Brietta, who was transformed into a Pegasus by Wenlock when she refused to marry him (explaining why Annika's parents are so overprotective). Annika decides to build the "Wand of Light" to break Wenlock's spell. In order to accomplish this, they must have a measure of courage, a ring of love and a gem of ice lit by hope's eternal flame. The Cloud Queen gives Brietta a crystal bell to ring if she is in need of help.  The group travels to the Forbidden Forest, where they meet a young man named Aidan who helps them after they get caught in a net. When Shiver and Annika fall into a giant's stew pot, Annika tricks him into chaining himself to a post, and uses her hair ribbon to climb out. The ribbon is the same length as her, and as a measure of courage, it turns into a staff for the Wand of Light.  After trading Annika's skates for a fake map from the old man Ferris, whom Aidan dislikes because they once played a sour card game together, the group find themselves in a large cavern filled with gems, where a sign tells them to take only what they need but never from greed. Annika gets one gem but Aidan gets another; at first Annika thinks that Aidan is being greedy but nothing happens. Shiver causes a cave-in thanks to her amazement of the gems' sparkles, which they narrowly manage to escape thanks to her. As Aidan starts to forge the Wand, he reveals that he ran away from his parents and lost all of his money gambling. He got an extra gem to bring to his parents so that he could get their forgiveness and their protection.  Brietta offers her tiara to make the ring of love. With all three objects, the "Wand of Light" is assembled. To prove that the Wand works, Annika asks for Brietta to be a human from the bottom of her heart. Then, Brietta is transformed back into a human.  Annika and Brietta return to the Cloud Kingdom on two pegasuses summoned by the Cloud Queen's bell, but Wenlock pursues them, hurting Brietta. Angrily Annika asks the wand to destroy Wenlock, but it does not work. Annika gives up and finally agrees to marry Wenlock so he will change her parents and the people back to normal. Wenlock refuses her because she is hateful, just like his other wives. He takes the wand from Annika's hand and causes a snowslide, trapping her.  Immediately Aidan comes and helps to dig Annika out. Aidan and Brietta brings an unconscious Annika to the Cloud Kingdom. After Annika wakes up, the trio go to Wenlock's lair. Blush decides not to give the clouds a dusk color to give Annika more time after some persuasion by Rose. While Brietta guards the pegasus, Annika, Aidan, and Shiver slide to the green castle. Aidan fights against the griffin as Annika searches for the wand. When she finds the wand, suddenly the gem falls. Fortunately, Aidan gives Annika his own.  Realizing how to work the wand, Annika asks it to defeat Wenlock for the love of her family and friends. Wenlock turns to be an ordinary person and the spell on Annika's parents is broken. Annika shows them Brietta and the entire family celebrates together, while Aidan's father forgives him. The end scene shows Aidan and Annika skating in the cloud palace. Both Aidan and Annika are wearing crowns, implying that they've gotten married. Brietta remarks that they look happy, and gifts the Cloud Queen with the wand, who replies that it will be the first star at night.  
Barbie: Fairytopia
 Elina, a wingless flower fairy, and her puffball friend Bibble watch their fairy friend Dandelion fly with three pixies. The pixies make fun of Elina for having no wings, but Elina ignores their teasing. Dandelion, however, defends Elina by fluttering her wings so hard that the small pixies are blown away. They later come back to warn Dandelion and Elina to go home "where it's safe". This is so they don't get kidnapped by someone named Laverna (who is already rumored to have kidnapped a fairy named Topaz). Elina thinks that Laverna is a myth, but Dandelion is unsure so she goes home to ask her mother. Elina and Bibble go back to Peony, her flower home.  Elina talks to Bibble about what the pixies said, but she thinks Topaz is too powerful to get kidnapped, as she is a guardian. Bibble is asleep, and Elina is still feeling uneasy, but Peony plays a lullaby for her, and she falls asleep. However, Topaz really has been kidnapped by Laverna. Laverna plans to kidnap all of the guardians, and then take over Fairytopia. Laverna calls her minions, Fungus, who reveal Laverna's formula. It had the power to weaken every flying creature in Fairytopia if they breathed it in; they would become so weak they would lose the power to fly. As she speaks, Laverna's minions are in all seven regions of Fairytopia and unleashing the formula. She thinks no one can stop her, as she is the only one with an antidote. Her main plan is to give everyone the antidote, and then everyone will love her for it and let her be their queen.  In the morning, Bibble has to wake up Elina because Peony didn't sing to wake them up. Elina goes outside and sees that Peony, as well as all the other fairy homes, are sick. Dandelion comes to see Elina and tells her that some of the fairies are having trouble flying, and Topaz is gone; the closest guardian is Azura, and she is far away, in Fairytown. Elina thinks that she has to go to Fairytown to see Azura, but Dandelion doesn't think it is a good idea; Elina has never left the meadow before, and it takes hours to get to Fairytown, even if you have wings. Elina really thinks she can't actually get there, but Bibble and Dandelion volunteer to join her, and they leave the Magic Meadow.  The trio enter a spooky forest and Dandelion flies up high to see if she can see a way out. When she is higher up, she breathes in some of Laverna's formula and can't fly. Elina realizes that Dandelion is getting sick, and it would be too hard for Dandelion to walk like Elina, as Elina was used to walking. She urges Dandelion to go home before dark to avoid panicking her mother, so Dandelion leaves Elina and Bibble. Meanwhile, Laverna has kidnapped another guardian: Ruby. He remains loyal to the Enchantress, Laverna's sister, and the ruler of Fairytopia. Laverna shows Topaz and Ruby the state the Enchantress is in, and it turns out she is very weak because of the formula.  Elina and Bibble get out of the forest and encounter a new place where all of the flowers are wilting. Elina jumps up to one of the highest flowers to get a view of the horizon. Bibble flies in front of a flower that is like a tunnel, so they go inside it. At the end of the tunnel is the City Hall of Fairytown, but it is closed. They tell the man there that they need to see Azura but she is not there. A fairy named Larkspur comes and the man working in the city hall tells him that Ruby, and another guardian named Amethyst, have been kidnapped. He has to find Azura immediately, so Elina and Bibble take advantage of this and follow him.  Elina and Bibble grab onto a flower and it floats after Larkspur, but they crash. They see Azura's house, but it is surrounded by guards. Elina and Bibble hide in a flower, but Azura spots them and tells them to leave. Elina tells Azura that they came all the way from the Magic Meadow, so Azura tells Elina to come closer. She sees a rainbow in Elina's eye for a second, and is shocked. She invites Elina into her house, and gives her food and shelter. Azura tells Elina that the rainbow in her eyes means she is destined for great things. When Elina goes to bed, Azura tells her that all of Fairytopia is in trouble and it is down to Laverna. In the morning she will leave to speak to a dryad named Dahlia, who lives in the Wildering Wood. Azura asks Elina to take care of her necklace.  In the morning, Azura wakes up Bibble and asks him to find Hue, who lives in the south; he needs to be given an important scroll. After that, Azura is about to leave, but is kidnapped by Fungus. Elina looks outside when she wakes up and sees that the guards have been tied up. A stout fairy thinks Elina has caused the trouble, so Elina runs away and gets helped by Hue, who has large wings and carries Elina to the Wildering Wood.  In Laverna's lair, the Fungus arrive with Azura, and Laverna notices that Azura isn't wearing her necklace. The Fungus tell Laverna that wingless fairy had it. Laverna realizes that Elina wouldn't be affected by the formula, as she couldn't fly. All of the Fungus are ordered to find Elina. Meanwhile, Hue tells Elina that after a day they will be in the Wildering Wood. However, they encounter some of Laverna's firebirds. To escape them, Hue flies off a rainbow colored waterfall into a cove. Hue disturbs some relaxing mermaids when he flies too low, including Prince Nalu.  Prince Nalu yells at Hue but stops when he sees Elina. Hue insists that the firebirds won't come down as they hate water, but they do. Prince Nalu throws them some special seaweed that will let them breathe underwater, so they all eat some. They swim with Prince Nalu to safety and he points them to the Wildering Wood. The prince hopes he can see Elina again, leading to Bibble making fun of them. They get on Hue but he breathes in some of Laverna's formula and Elina orders him to land so he can rest. She asks Bibble to stay with Hue and she goes to find Dahlia by herself.  When Elina is by herself, she begins doubting herself and comparing herself to Azura, a great guardian. Some happy trolls appear who will lead Elina to Dahlia. They go a long way, but still only see sick trees. Azura's necklace starts glowing and it "calls" Dahlia. The happy trolls leave and Dahlia says she can't help Elina; she doesn't want to help the guardians as the last time she tried to help them, none of them believed she was good except for Azura, as she had been working with Laverna. Azura believed that Dahlia would know how to defeat Laverna because of this, but Dahlia doesn't want to risk herself for Fairytopia. Elina convinces her otherwise and they go back to Hue and Bibble. Hue and Bibble insist on coming with Elina and Dahlia and they start to go after Laverna.  In Laverna's lair, she has all the guardians kidnapped. Laverna places a crystal in her throne and the guardian's necklaces feel the presence of Azura's necklace, which is with Elina. Laverna knows she is near, so she orders the Fungus to get her. Dahlia tells Elina that, when she had left Laverna, Laverna had created a device that used the strength of her royal bloodline to suck the powers from the fairy guardian's necklaces, and transfer them to herself. She doesn't know how it works, but she knew that the "union point" would be the weakness.  The group arrives at Laverna's lair, and they can't go in the air because of the firebirds. Their plan is to go in and find the union point, but Elina wants to go by herself as she has Azura's necklace. While Elina is running over to the lair, she almost gets caught by the Fungus, but Hue flies in with Dahlia to distract them. When Bibble tries to distract them he is captured. Elina makes it to the lair, and Dahlia, Bibble, and Hue have been brought to Laverna by the Fungus. When the Fungus leave, Elina finds them and tells Laverna to let them go. Laverna will only let them go if Elina gives her the necklace, but she refuses. Laverna sees the rainbow in Elina's eye, and tells her she could have wings if she went to Laverna's side.  With the wings Laverna gave her, Elina becomes brainwashed. Laverna tells Elina that, together, they can have what they want; Laverna will rule Fairytopia, and Elina will have wings, with everything in her world as she remembered it. Laverna tells Elina to put Azura's necklace around Azura's neck, and Elina will get everything she's ever wanted. The guardians' necklaces make them lose their powers and they start transferring to Laverna. Elina puts the necklace on Azura and snaps out of her brainwashed mindset, and sees that the union point is where the crystal is. She takes the necklace off Azura and throws it at the crystal, breaking it. The guardians get their powers back. Laverna, her throne, and her sceptre disappear. The guardians are safe.  Back in the Magic Meadow, the pixies are flying again, and everyone is glad to see Elina. Hue comes to see Elina, and so does the Enchantress. She thanks Elina and her friends for saving everyone, and says that Elina has earned a great gift. The Enchantress gives Elina a rainbow colored necklace and flies away. The necklace begins to glow and Elina gets beautiful, pink wings. She flies with her own wings for the first time, and Elina, Dandelion, Hue and Bibble fly together.  
Batman Begins
  As a child, [[Batman#Bruce Wayne|Bruce Wayne]] falls down into a dry well and is attacked by a swarm of bats, subsequently developing a phobia of the creatures. While watching an opera with his parents, [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne|Martha]], Bruce becomes frightened by performers masquerading as bats and asks to leave. Outside, mugger [[Joe Chill]] murders Bruce's parents in front of him. Orphaned, Bruce is raised by the family butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]].  Fourteen years later, Chill is freed in exchange for testifying against [[Gotham City]] mafia boss [[Carmine Falcone]]. Bruce intends to murder Chill, but one of Falcone's assassins does so first. Bruce's childhood friend, Assistant District Attorney [[Rachel Dawes]], berates him for attempting to undermine the justice system, saying that his father would be ashamed. Bruce confronts Falcone, who tells him that real power comes from being feared. Bruce decides to travel the world and learn how to confront injustice. While serving a prison sentence for theft in [[Bhutan]], he meets [[Henri Ducard]], who trains him as a member of the [[League of Assassins|League of Shadows]], led by [[Ra's al Ghul]]. After completing his training and purging his fears, Bruce learns that the League intends to destroy Gotham, believing it to be corrupt, decadent, hypocritical and beyond saving. Bruce rejects the League's cause and burns down their temple during his escape. Ra's is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves the unconscious Ducard.  Bruce returns to Gotham intent on fighting crime. Inspired by his childhood fear, he takes up the [[vigilante]] identity of "Batman" and sets up a base in the [[Batcave|caves]] beneath [[Wayne Manor]]. He takes an interest in his family's company, [[Wayne Enterprises]], now run by the unscrupulous William Earle. Company archivist [[Lucius Fox]] allows Bruce access to prototype defense technologies, including a protective bodysuit and a heavily armored car, the [[Batmobile|Tumbler]]. Bruce poses as a shallow [[Playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] to allay suspicion.  Batman intercepts a drug shipment, provides Rachel with evidence against Falcone, and enlists Sergeant [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], one of the few honest cops left in Gotham, to arrest him. In the prison, Falcone meets [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Dr. Jonathan Crane]], a corrupt psychologist whom he has helped smuggle drugs into Gotham, and threatens to reveal his complicity if he does not declare him mentally unfit for trial. Crane puts on a scarecrow mask and sprays Falcone with a [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)#Fear gas|fear-inducing hallucinogen]] that drives him insane (which causes Falcone to constantly mouth the word "Scarecrow"), and has him transferred to [[Arkham Asylum]]. While investigating "the Scarecrow", Batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated. He is saved by Alfred and given an antidote developed by Fox. When Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, Crane reveals that he has been pouring his fear-inducing drug into Gotham's water supply. He drugs Rachel with it, but Batman saves her and subdues Crane, who claims to work for Ra's al Ghul. Batman evades the police to get Rachel to safety, administers the antidote, and gives her a vial of it for Gordon and another for mass production. Ducard reappears at Bruce's birthday party and reveals himself to be the true Ra's al Ghul. Having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from Wayne Enterprises, he plans to vaporize Gotham's water supply, rendering Crane's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city. He sets Wayne Manor aflame and leaves Bruce to die, but Alfred rescues him.  Ra's loads the microwave emitter onto Gotham's [[monorail]] system, intending to release the drug as the train travels toward the city's central water source. Batman rescues Rachel from a drugged mob and indirectly reveals his identity to her. He pursues Ra's onto the monorail and fights him just as Gordon uses the Tumbler's cannons to destroy a section of the track. Batman refuses to kill Ra's, but also chooses not to save him, gliding from the train and leaving Ra's aboard as it crashes and explodes, killing him.  Bruce gains Rachel's respect but loses her love, as she decides she cannot be with him while he is Batman. Bruce buys a controlling stake in the now publicly traded Wayne Enterprises, fires Earle, and replaces him with Fox. Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant of the [[Gotham City Police Department]], shows Batman the [[Bat-Signal]], and mentions a [[Joker (The Dark Knight)|criminal]] who leaves [[Joker (playing card)|Joker playing cards]] at crime scenes. Batman promises to investigate, and disappears into the night.  
The Baxter
 Elliot ([[Michael Showalter]]), a tax accountant from [[Brooklyn]], is a dependable though thoroughly average young man doomed to be the "Baxter", the nice guy who's bound to lose the girl to the [[leading man]] in [[romantic comedy|romantic comedies]]. Losing three girlfriends to last-minute rekindled relationships with their ex-boyfriends has made Elliot wary of being abandoned yet again.  About a week before his wedding to his girlfriend, Caroline Swann ([[Elizabeth Banks]]), Elliot discovers that her high school beau, Bradley ([[Justin Theroux]]), is back in town. Elliot tries to keep himself composed, but even Caroline's reassurances do not convince him that her feelings for Bradley are buried. In the meantime, Elliot meets Cecil ([[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]]), his temporary secretary at his accounting firm. As he resigns himself to losing Caroline to Bradley, Cecil offers him a ray of hope: she does not believe in "Baxters" and thinks that his predicament is avoidable.  The two meet up again later that night at a small club where Cecil performs her original songs, and Cecil tells Elliot he needs to take more risks. When Cecil has a fight with her unsupportive boyfriend Dan ([[Paul Rudd]]), Elliot offers to put her up for the night. The next morning, Caroline shows up early with their wedding planner ([[Peter Dinklage]]) to finalize their plans. Elliot panics due to Cecil's hidden presence and during the meeting makes a string of awkward suggestions, upsetting Caroline, who begins to doubt his commitment to their relationship, to the point of calling off the wedding.  While out to a bar with his friends from work, Elliot accidentally runs into Dan, who recognizes him as Cecil's "Baxter" friend. Dan is there to meet with Sonya, who's Bradley's current girlfriend and Dan's old college friend. They all decide to sit together, much to Elliot's chagrin. Both Dan and Bradley laugh and joke with Elliot's friends, until one of them mentions that Caroline left him. Depressed and upset, Elliot leaves and contemplates suicide but he's interrupted by Caroline's brother-in-law, Louis ([[David Wain]]), who tells him Caroline is willing to give their engagement another chance.  Elliot plans a romantic dinner with Caroline, but finds her with an anguished Bradley, who just broke up with Sonya and is back flirting with Caroline. Caroline convinces Elliot to take Bradley out with them. They cancel Elliot's reservations to an expensive restaurant and go instead to a burger place that Bradley knows well. Elliot feels out-of-place and eventually calls Cecil from the back of the restaurant, confessing that he feels that his marriage will be over before it begins.  The next day, Elliot arrives at work to find that Cecil is his temp again. When she proposes to go have a drink together, Elliot explains that after his phone call, the night actually got better for him. As Caroline accused Elliot of being unromantic, he stood up for himself and accepted to go dance with her and Bradley, actually impressing Caroline with his moves. Bradley shows off his [[breakdancing|breakdance]] routines, accidentally hitting Elliot in the face, to Caroline's concerns. Bradley apologizes and reveals that he will leave the next morning to [[Malta]] for his work as a [[geode]] student.  Though happy for him, Cecil is saddened by the news because of her growing feelings for Elliot. She mentions that Dan is moving to [[Cincinnati]] and she's going to follow him there, to Elliot's discomfort.  At Caroline and Elliot's wedding, Bradley crashes the ceremony and declares his love for Caroline, a split second after Elliot was going to voice his own objection. Caroline finally gives in and kisses Bradley passionately in front of the whole church. Elliot takes off immediately to catch Cecil before she leaves town, and finds her at her apartment right while Dan is leaving. Elliot declares his love for her, and chases off an old friend of hers ([[Ken Marino]]) who suddenly showed up. Later, they perform together at the same club where they had their first date, with Cecil singing one of her songs and Elliot playing the piano to back her up.  In a mid-credits scene, Dan reflects in narration on his own status as a Baxter, having just lost the girl to the leading man.  
The Batman vs. Dracula
  The [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] break out of [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham]], racing to find a stash of stolen money hidden within a crypt in Gotham Cemetery. Joker is quickly intercepted by the [[Batman]] and is electrocuted when he falls into a river by his super-charged joy buzzers, while Penguin takes the opportunity to enter the cemetery himself. While searching through a crypt, Penguin accidentally cuts his hand while using his umbrella-sword to open a coffin he hopes contains the money, finding a body instead. Blood from his hand drips on the corpse's heart, which brings it to life; it is none other than the [[vampire]] lord [[Count Dracula]], his body having been moved from [[Transylvania]] to [[Gotham City]] after his "death". Penguin is spared from being bitten thanks to a watchman, whom Dracula bites instead; once the watchman revives as a vampire, Dracula hypnotizes Penguin into serving him as a sentinel to guard his coffin during the day  One night, the Batman witnesses a vampire attack, but decides to put the incident at the back of his mind and, as Bruce Wayne, proceeds to host a corporate party at his manor. Dracula appears at the party, disguised as a cultural anthropologist under the name Dr. "Alucard" , claiming to be visiting to study the Batman (believing his legacy had an influence on Batman's existence), and takes an interest in [[Vicki Vale]], a reporter who is interviewing and dating Bruce. After failing to bite Bruce to quench his thirst, Dracula bites a waiter instead; the new vampire scares Bruce's butler [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]]. Bruce immediately deduces "''Alucard''" is Dracula, and that the disappearances of Gotham citizens, who have been dubbed "Lost Ones" by the media, is because they are being turned into vampires. Due to eyewitnesses claiming to see a bat-like figure during the attacks, however, it is mistakenly reported the Batman is behind the disappearances instead. When Batman goes to Gotham Cemetery to look for Dracula, he is chased down by a [[SWAT]] unit, all of whose members are taken by Dracula as they chase him back into the city. During a fight with the Batman, Dracula offers to let him join his conquest of Gotham; Batman refuses. Just as Dracula has the Batman at his mercy, the sun rises and Dracula is forced to retreat, vowing to kill Batman for rejecting his offer.  At the cemetery, Joker reappears alive and well and confronts Penguin. He asks where the treasure is, thinking Penguin has already found it, chasing him into Dracula's tomb. However, despite Penguin's warning to not open Dracula's coffin, Joker ends up "breakfast in bed, freshly-squeezed" for Dracula, much to Penguin's disgust. Joker attacks a blood bank, leading to his capture by Batman. While the Batman attempts to concoct an antidote from the Joker's infected cellular structure, Alfred discovers that Dracula once had a vampire [[Brides of Dracula|bride]], [[Carmilla|Carmilla Karnstein]], who was killed by sunlight. During his research, however, Bruce stands up an understanding Vicki, who is soon kidnapped by Dracula. Finally, the Batman is able to cure the Joker of his vampirism and ascertain the location of Dracula's lair in Gotham Cemetery before returning him to Arkham. He then proceeds to mass-produce the vaccine to defeat Dracula and cure his victims.  Dracula attempts to sacrifice Vicki's soul to reanimate his bride Carmilla. Upon learning Vicki has been kidnapped, the Batman rushes to Dracula's lair with his anti-vampirism vaccine and arsenal of weapons, defeating and curing all the "Lost Ones" that attack him in the catacombs beneath Gotham Cemetery. The Batman then frees Vicki, disrupting the reanimation ritual. Dracula sends the Penguin to recapture Vicki while he fights the Batman, who lures Dracula into the Batcave where Batman would have the advantages over the vampire. In an attempt to aid his master, Alfred injects Dracula with the anti-vampirisim vaccine, but it is useless as he was always a vampire. When Dracula resumes his pursuit, Batman incinerates him with his prototype solar energy storing machine by striking him with the sunlight that was stored within, reducing Dracula to a pile of ashes and bones. This also frees the Penguin from his control, who, while chasing Vicki, finally finds the hidden treasure that caused all the trouble in the first place. Sadly, for the Penguin, he is arrested and blamed for Dracula's kidnappings, causing the media to think he was forcing people to find the treasure. Having defeated an ultimate evil, the Batman triumphantly continues his duties to defend Gotham against anyone who may threaten its safety.  
Bashing (film)
 Yuko Takai and a few other Japanese political activists in the Middle East were kidnapped and used as hostages. Upon returning to Japan, Yuko is mistreated for basically "making ripples in the water;" in other words, for not committing suicide and for making the Japanese look weak. This story is based on the real affairs of the kidnapping of three Japanese political activists by Muslim terrorists in Iraq in April 2004. Yuko Takai is a model of Nahoko Takato, a political activist, who was also harshly criticised by almost all Japanese.  
Battle in Heaven
 Marcos ([[Marcos HernÃ¡ndez (actor)|Marcos HernÃ¡ndez]]) is a working class man in Mexico, employed by "the general." Marcos learns that the baby that he and his wife kidnapped for ransom had accidentally died. The remainder of the film follows a despondent Marcos, seemingly haunted by the moral and/or legal implications of his actions.  Marcos stands next to his wife Berta (Berta Ruiz) at the subway as she sells clocks and sweets at a stand. He travels to the airport to meet the "general's" upper-middle class daughter, Ana ([[Anapola Mushkadiz]]) whom he has known since she was a child. Ana orders Marcos to take her to the "boutique" where she works in the [[Prostitution|sex trade]]. While driving, Marcos is very distracted, and at one point stalls the car.  Ana recognises that something is wrong, but Marcos claims he's distracted only because of his wife's supposed ill health.  Ana invites Marcos into the "boutique" so that he can have sex with one of her "friends." Marcos is apparently not aroused by the "friend." The friend tells Ana that Marcos would prefer her instead. Ana goes to talk to Marcos, and reminds him that they have known each other since her childhood. Marcos then reveals that he and his wife kidnapped a baby but the baby died before they could collect any ransom. Ana seems to remain composed at hearing this news.  Back home, Marcos has sex with his wife, Berta. They seem united in their sorrow regarding the dead baby. Marcos tells Berta that he told Ana about the kidnapped baby, indicating that the confession brought him relief. Berta, upset, demands that he make sure that "the princess" does not tell anyone. The next day, Marcos visits Ana. She seems annoyed by his visit, but drives him to her place where they have sex. Ana advises Marcos to turn himself in to the police.  Marcos, Berta, their son, and a few friends (including the mother of the dead baby, who does not know who took her child, nor that it has died) go out to the countryside. Marcos tells Berta that he is going to turn himself in.  She asks him to wait until after the pilgrimage (which is in honor of the Lady of Guadalupe), an event that Marcos had earlier shown disdain for. Marcos seems to agree with his wife.

Marcos buries his face in his hands.  Marcos visits Ana at her home. He tells her that he will turn himself into the police that day. She gives him a goodbye kiss. Marcos leaves the apartment. He pees his pants, goes back to the apartment and fatally stabs Ana.  The police become aware of both the attack on Ana and the death of the baby, and are in search for Marcos. Marcos seems to have joined the pilgrimage to the Basilica, at first on foot, and then on his knees. Someone places a hood over his face, but Marcos continues to hobble forward. The hood becomes increasingly stained with blood as he makes his way into the Basilica during the church service.  Eventually the pilgrims are gone, and the Basilica is vacant. The police allow Berta to go in to see her husband. She touches him on the head and he collapses.

Chili is impressed by singer Linda Moon and helps free her from contractual obligations to Nick Carr and Raji, who has a gay [[Samoa]]n bodyguard named Elliott, an aspiring actor and the butt of Carr and Raji's [[Homophobia|homophobic]] jokes.

Beauty Shop
 Gina Norris ([[Queen Latifah]]) is a [[widow]]ed hairstylist who has moved from [[Chicago]] to [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] so her daughter Vanessa ([[Paige Hurd]]) can attend a private music school. She's made a name for herself as a stylist, but after her self-centered boss, Jorge ([[Kevin Bacon]]), criticizes her decisions, she leaves and sets up her own shop, purchasing a run-down salon by the skin of her teeth by helping out a loan officer.  Upon buying the salon, she runs into instant barriers: loudmouthed young stylists, older clients who are fixed in their habits, an energetic young boy named Willie ([[Lil' JJ]]) who constantly flirts with women (including Vanessa) while filming for his next music video, people wary of her ability as a hairdresser, and the constant trouble her rebellious sister-in-law, Darnelle ([[Keshia Knight Pulliam]]), finds herself in. Gina issues an ultimatum with Darnelle to clean up her act and start paying her back or she will be evicted. In a short time, the previous owner's clients become her own and many of her former customers find their way from Jorge's to her salon. When electrical issues arise, she finds that the upstairs renter, Joe, is a handsome electrician from [[Africa]] who eventually bonds with Vanessa due to his skills on the piano. Because Jorge is jealous that his shop is losing clients to Gina's, he pays a health inspector named Crawford ([[Jim Holmes]]), to find various ways to shut down Gina's business.  Over time, neighborhood regulars frequent the shop and the varied stylists become close to Gina, as does Joe ([[Djimon Hounsou]]). One of her former clients from Jorge's even uses her connections to set up a meeting with Cover Girl for Gina's homemade miracle conditioner, affectionately called "hair crack".  Tragedy strikes when the shop is trashed and heavily vandalized the night before Vanessa's big piano recital. When Gina next enters the shop, she finds not only that her staff has cleaned up the majority of the mess and brought items from home so the shop could operate, but Darnelle has also decided to grow up and enter [[beauty school]]. While filming for his next topic, Willie tapes a meeting between Jorge and Inspector Crawford and learns that they were responsible for trying to ruin Gina. Shortly, a disheveled woman enters the shop and begs for someone to fix her hair for a wedding she has in a few hours. Soon after, Willie shows Gina the videotape of a meeting he filmed of Jorge and Inspector Crawford. Later that night, Gina goes to Jorge's salon to not only tell him about the tape, but that she knows he is not Jorge from Austria, but George Christie from Nebraska. As soon as Gina leaves, James ([[Bryce Wilson]]) (Gina's only male employee) and a few of his friends give Jorge an extreme haircut as payback for what he did to her in trying to close her shop.  Later, as the shop listens to their favorite radio talk-show host DJ Hollerin' Helen ([[Adele Givens]]), they find out she was the desperate customer on the way to the wedding as she gives the shop (and Gina's "hair crack" conditioner) a shout-out on the radio.

His business partners, Fabrice and Sami, spend much of their time ruthlessly chasing squatters and illegal immigrants out of the buildings they have procured and trying to work their way around government housing regulations. Thomas is born to this kind of work; his father, Robert, is also involved in dodgy enterprises and sometimes calls upon Thomas to beat up people who refuse to pay. Tom shows a protective and defensive attitude toward his father who doesn't always appreciate what his son does for him â so much so that when his father introduces his new girlfriend to Tom, Tom undermines her to her face, and insults her to his father, insisting she is an opportunistic "whore." Later, when he tries to enlist her help to watch over his father, she tells him they broke up due to Robert changing his attitude and she is aware of Tom's backstabbing because Robert told her. Robert by this time is in danger from a Russian gangster, Minskov (Anton Yakovlev) who scammed him out of 300,000 Euros and Tom is worried for his safety.  Tom chances upon his late mother's manager, his mother having been a concert pianist until she died 8 years previously. The manager remembers him playing something when he was 20 years old, and invites him to audition for him. The opportunity rapidly takes over Tom's imagination, becoming an obsession. He finds a teacher newly emigrated to France, virtuoso Miao Lin, to help him prepare for the audition. She speaks only Chinese, Vietnamese and some English, but no French. Tom misses appointments and drops assignments while practicing piano around the clock, and having an affair with the wife of one of his promiscuous business partners. Finally Tom reaches the high standards of his teacher, but he falls apart at the audition, having stayed up all night helping his partners with a business deal. He goes to see his father only to find the apartment destroyed and his father murdered. Tom is devastated.  Two years later: Tom tests a piano onstage and gives directions to the stage manager. He drives Miao Lin to the concert hall and parks the car, when he chances to see Minskov. He follows Minskov, and takes him by surprise waiting for an elevator. They fight in the stairwell, Minskov almost shooting Tom. Tom gains the upper hand and tries to use Minskov's own gun against him, but cannot pull the trigger. Tom washes in the restroom and takes his seat in the concert hall, knuckles and shirt bloody, exchanging affectionate glances with Miao Lin at the piano. He is evidently Miao Lin's manager and partner.

Because of Winn-Dixie (film)
 10-year-old India Opal Buloni has just moved to the fictional small town of Naomi, Florida with her father, a [[preacher]].  While in the [[Winn-Dixie]] supermarket, she encounters a scruffy [[Berger Picard]] that is wreaking havoc.<ref>[[Berger Picard]]</ref> Opal claims that it is her dog and names it "Winn-Dixie". Winn-Dixie becomes friends with everyone he encounters, and so Opal makes some new friends in the process. She also rekindles her relationship with her father, and learns ten things about her mother, who abandoned them seven years ago. Opal describes the preacher as a  turtle, always sticking his head into his turtle shell, and never wanting to come out into the real world. This is most likely because of how sad he is about her mother, with whom he is still in love.  One of the people Opal meets is Miss Franny Block, a kind and somewhat eccentric elder librarian, who tells her many great stories, including one involving a bear. Opal also meets Gloria Dump, a blind recovering alcoholic with a tree in her backyard that has beer bottles hanging from it. She calls it a 'mistake tree' and the bottles represent the ghosts of all the things she has done wrong. One day, fed up with Winn-Dixie, the landlord of the Bulonis' trailer park, Mr. Alfred, orders the preacher to get rid of the dog. The preacher calls the animal pound to take Winn-Dixie away, but Opal begs her father to keep her dog. Unable to see his daughter this upset, the preacher tells the pound to return Winn-Dixie, claiming that he is not the same dog he called about.  Opal gets a job at Gertrude's Pets and befriends a worker there, Otis, a shy ex-convict with a passion for music. She also meets a girl named Sweetie Pie Thomas, who is eager to get a dog like Winn-Dixie. Later, a thunderstorm comes and Winn-Dixie, being pathologically afraid of thunderstorms, runs away. While Opal looks for him, her father wants to give up and she blames him for the loss of her mother and Winn-Dixie running away. But her father explains that he tried very hard to look for her mother. He then admits that he believes that she is never coming back. Later they go back to a party and Otis starts to sing a song on his guitar. Winn-Dixie is heard outside howling along to the song. Everyone, while singing, lets him in and welcomes him back.

However, no one will join her and Sven reminds her that he is now king and that she is betrothed to him. Freya and Ingrid go to the island alone to rescue her father.  Eric ([[Justin Whalin]]) steps forward and tells everyone they've all been acting like cowards. He also says he'll go and save the king's daughter himself if Sven does not dare.

Being Cyrus
 The Sethna family of [[Panchgani]] consists of retired sculptor Dinshaw ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]) and his wife Katy ([[Dimple Kapadia]]). Dinshaw's brother Farrokh ([[Boman Irani]]), their father Fardoonjee (Honey Chhaya), and Farrokh's wife Tina ([[Simone Singh]]) reside in Mumbai.  It is at this time that Cyrus Mistry ([[Saif Ali Khan]]), the narrator of the story, shows up at the Sethnas' doorstep in Panchgani one morning, a seeming wanderer hailing from [[Jamshedpur]] who professes his admiration for Dinshaw's work and asks if he can be his apprentice. Dinshaw and Katy agree, and soon the young man becomes a part of their life. Katy makes advances towards Cyrus, which he tolerates while cryptically telling the audience that he is "playing Katy". As time passes Cyrus gets to know the oddball couple better â Dinshaw is a perpetually zoned-out eccentric, though a rather affable one, while the rather promiscuous Katy, tired of slow-moving Panchgani life and her moth-eaten marriage, has embarked on an affair with her brother-in-law Farrokh in [[Mumbai]]. Katy makes Cyrus her pawn, sending him to Mumbai to visit her father-in-law Fardoonjee, who lives in an extension of Farrokh's flat, with orders to get a stash of money Fardoonjee supposedly has. On meeting Fardoonjee, Cyrus realizes that he is ill-treated by Farrokh. Farrokh's timid young wife, Tina, is unable to be herself except during the few hours Farrokh is at work. She enjoys smoking, loud music and goes to hair appointments when Farrokh is gone.  One day Katy convinces Cyrus to go and murder her father in law and Tina so that she can be with Farrokh. Unknown to Cyrus, Farrokh plans to kill him after the deed to close the loose end. Cyrus arrives at a time when Tina is coincidentally out for a waxing appointment. He feeds Fardoonjee his favorite dish and kills him immediately afterwards. This is positioned to the audience as a mercy killing to release Fardoonjee from his wretched existence. Farrokh sneaks into the house but Cyrus kills him instead. When Katy calls to check on Farrokh, Cyrus picks up the phone and tells her that her plan is in tatters. And then Cyrus vanishes.  The Inspector calls Katy and Dinshaw for interrogation. She constantly blames Cyrus for the murder. When the Inspector investigates, he finds no evidence of any person named Cyrus even in the market in Panchgani. So Katy and Dinshaw are arrested for the murders while poor Tina is sent home with both her and the Inspector agreeing that she was lucky to be away at that time.  A few months later, Tina is in her bedroom when the door is opened surreptitiously by Cyrus. It looks like he has come to finish the last murder. Shockingly, Tina and Cyrus embrace each other. They are siblings. This whole murder is shown to be an elaborate plot by Tina to inherit the whole property. With Fardoonjee and Farrokh dead, and Katy and Dinshaw in Jail, her plot has been successful. Tina is shown as a cold-blooded schemer who identifies such families, gets married into the family and has Cyrus murder the members. Cyrus is shown to have a conscience. While Tina is showering, he sees a newspaper where Tina has marked another family for this scheme. Unwilling to participate in this any further, he runs away with the money they took before Tina comes out of the shower.  
Bee Season (film)
 Saul Naumann ([[Richard Gere|Gere]]) is a somewhat controlling [[Jew]]ish husband and father.  A Religious Studies professor at [[UC Berkeley]], Saul wrote his graduate [[thesis]] on the [[Kabbalah]].  Because he was a devout Jew, his wife Miriam ([[Juliette Binoche|Binoche]]) converted to [[Judaism]] when they married, and he nurtured his son Aaron ([[Max Minghella]]) as a traditional studious Jew like himself.  When daughter Eliza ([[Flora Cross]]) wins her class spelling bee, they embark on a course of Kabbalah study to help her win.  The film follows the family and the spiritual quests upon which they journey, in large part because of Saul: Miriam's attempt to make herself whole, Aaron's religious uncertainty, and Eliza's desire to be closer to her father.  Miriam lives a secret life throughout her entire marriage to Saul, trying to fulfill the religious idea she learned from him, ''[[tikkun olam]],'' or "repairing the world" and "reuniting its shards." In momentary flashbacks by Miriam, we glimpse a scene of a crashed car with shattered glass, apparently the basis of an underlying hurt she has been suffering since childhood, perhaps the death of her parents. The beautiful life she had before the accident, symbolized by the kaleidoscope she always carried as a child, through which she was presented with its beautiful view of the world, is suddenly shattered when the accident occurred. Thereafter, seeking to restore the broken shards, Miriam compulsively creates beautiful light gathering objects (sometimes stealing them) and storing them in a secret warehouse.  Saul's son, Aaron, grows unsure of the Judaism foisted on him by his father, and in trying to find a faith he personally believes in, he becomes a [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] after meeting a woman named Chali in the park. For Eliza, her experience begins with a desire to be as close to her father as he and Aaron are; the two would often have discussions about Judaism and play music together.  Saul's graduate thesis on Kabbalah writer [[Abraham Abulafia]] (who believed that careful analysis of words could lead to contact with God) brings Saul and Eliza closer together when Saul learns Eliza has won the district [[spelling bee]].  Upon learning of her success, Saul takes control of Eliza's life, coaching her in the Kabbalistic teachings he knows so well. Eliza enjoys the renewed attention of her father and pursues the competition for her father's involvement.  This comes at the expense of Aaron, who receives less time with Saul, even as he falls deeper into  religious questioning. At the center of the film, Eliza becomes Saul's newest religious project. Eliza continues to do well at spelling bees, utilizing her spiritual gift, as Abraham Abulafia described: visions appear to her and help her spell words no matter how difficult.  Saul's obsession with his daughter's gift and the opportunities it presents to him consume him to the point that he is callously ignorant of the collapse of his family around him â his son's interest in Hinduism, which soon comes between him and his father, and his wife's psychological problems suddenly thrust upon him â it seems that the entire family is now "broken," like a microcosm of the world; but can it be fixed, can the broken shards be restored? This is where Eliza enters the picture, a child with a  mystical gift.  The night before the final round of the spelling bee, Eliza uses her father's notes on Abulafia's system to obtain "the ear of God," allowing God to flow through her. Her body convulsing epileptically on the floor, Eliza apparently makes that mystical connection, providing her the healing power of God. In the final scene, Eliza, on the verge of winning the national spelling bee, and now empowered with the ability to heal her family, deliberately misspells the word [[origami]], thereby losing the competition. Immediately upon her sacrifice, healing apparently takes place between Saul and Aaron as they  embrace and openly express loving emotion; and Miriam, watching the competition on television from a sanitarium (where she has been following her arrest and the subsequent discovery of her secret), is apparently in the process of being healed as well.  
Being Caribou
 Allison, an [[environmentalist]], and Heuer, a [[wildlife biologist]], follow a herd of 120,000 caribou on foot, across 1,500 kilometres (900 Miles) of [[Arctic]] [[tundra]], in order to raise awareness of threats to the caribou's survival.<ref>{{cite web   | last = Hattam   | first = Jennifer   | title = Being Caribou   | work = A Real Refuge    | publisher = Sierra Club   | url = http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/200603/refuge.asp   | accessdate = 2008-03-11}}</ref> At stake is the herd's delicate [[habitat]], which is threatened by proposed [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] development in the herd's [[calf#Terminology|calving]] grounds in [[Alaska]]'s [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]].  
Beneath Still Waters
 Studying under a disciple of [[Aleister Crowley]], the leader of an upper class group invokes a supernatural force that slowly devours the village of Marienbad and its inhabitants, threatening to spread beyond its geographical limits. The mayor from the town nearby commissions the building of a dam which would flood the valley and therefore submerge the village forever sealing the evil force under water after leader and his followers were incapacitated to be kept from escaping. However, fate ensured the leader's freedom as he remained in the depths when the waters covered Marienbad. Now 40 years later an array of disappearances and deaths in mysterious circumstances are threatening the town next to the reservoir that now covers Marienbad.  
Bewitched (2005 film)
 Jack Wyatt is a [[narcissistic]] actor who is approached to play the role of Darrin in a remake of the 1960s [[sitcom]] ''[[Bewitched]]'', but insists that an unknown play Samantha. Isabel Bigelow is an actual witch who decides she wants to be normal and moves to [[Los Angeles]] to start a new life and becomes friends with her neighbor Maria. She goes to a bookstore to learn how to get a job after seeing an advertisement of [[Ed McMahon]] on television. Jack happens to be at the same bookstore after attending some failed Samantha auditions. Jack spots Isabel and persuades her to audition. At the same time, while she's trying to settle into her new life, Isabel's intrusive father Nigel keeps appearing to convince her to return home, despite several rejections from Isabel.  After Isabel impresses the show's producers and writers, Jack finally convinces Isabel to join the show. Also joining the show is legendary actress Iris Smythson as Endora. After a successful taping of the pilot, Isabel happens to overhear a conversation Jack is having with his agent Ritchie. They are talking about how they tricked Isabel to appear without having any lines. Furious, Isabel storms off with Maria and new friend Nina close behind. She decides she only has three choices: quit, get mad, or live with it. Instead, Isabel's Aunt Clara visits and aids Isabel in casting a spell on Jack in order to make him fall in love with her. At the same time, Nigel is introduced to Iris and becomes infatuated with her.  The hex works and Jack becomes love struck by Isabel, insisting on several script changes to give her some dialogue and jokes, ignoring statements from test groups preferring Isabel over him. Jack's affection for Isabel grows and he asks her out on a date, making Isabel forget about the hex. But when he brings her home, she remembers and reverses it back to when she and Aunt Clara cast it. The next day, rather than the events the hex presented, Jack is outraged by the scores he received and takes his anger out on Isabel, who lashes back at him. Ritchie fires her, and she storms off.  Rather than be angry at her, Jack is fascinated with Isabel and chases after her, accepting all her comments. After another taping (with Isabel getting dialogue), their romance blossoms. But the next day, Jack's former wife Sheila arrives, determined to woo Jack back. Isabel sees this and casts a spell on her making her sign the divorce papers and have her decide to move to [[Iceland]]. Jack, thrilled, announces he will be throwing a party at his house celebrating the divorce.  Nigel attends the party with Iris and when Nigel begins flirting with much younger guests, Iris reveals that she is also a witch and casts a spell on each girl. When Jack makes a toast stating truth will be revealed with everyone, Isabel decides to tell Jack she's a witch. At first thinking she's simply an amateur magician, Jack officially believes her when she levitates him with her broom. Jack becomes frightened and shoos her away with a stick. Offended, Isabel flies off.  Jack takes this hard, being brought to the studios by the police and becoming disenchanted with the project. Isabel decides to return home as she no longer wishes to stay. Jack, imagining himself on the ''Conan O'Brien Show'', is visited by Uncle Arthur. Arthur convinces Jack not to let Isabel leave, because Jack still loves her and wouldn't be able to return for 100 years (which is later proven to be a lie Arthur made up to inspire Jack). Arthur drives him to the studio where he finds Isabel at the set. Jack apologizes to her and tells her he wants to marry her. They do and move into their new neighborhood (which resembles the neighborhood in the series, with the Kravitzes living right across the street).  
Beowulf & Grendel
 In 500 A.D., [[Hrothgar]], king of [[Denmark]], and a group of warriors chase a large and burly man, whom they consider a [[troll]], and his young son, to the edge of a steep seaside cliff. The father directs his young son, [[Grendel]], to hide from the attackers' view; whereupon The Danes shoot the father dead, and his dead body plunges onto the beach far below. The Danish king sees the young Grendel, but spares him. Later, Grendel finds his father's body and cuts the head off to take it home. Many years later, the severed (and mummified) head is inside a cave where the boy Grendel has become as large and powerful as his father, and plans [[revenge]].  When Hrothgar finds twenty of his warriors killed inside his great hall, the Danish king falls into a depression. [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]], with the permission of [[Hygelac]], king of [[GÃ¶taland|Geatland]], sails to Denmark with thirteen Geats to slay Grendel for Hrothgar. The arrival of Beowulf and his warriors is welcomed by Hrothgar, but the king's village has fallen into a deep despair and many of the pagan villagers convert to Christianity at the urging of an [[Irish monk]]. While Grendel does raid Hrothgar's village during the night, he flees rather than fight. Selma the witch tells Beowulf that Grendel will not fight him because Beowulf has committed no wrong against him.  A villager, recently baptized and thus now unafraid of death, leads Beowulf and his men to the cliff above Grendel's cave. When the villager is found dead, Beowulf and his men return with a rope and gain entry to Grendel's secret cave, where one of Beowulf's men mutilates the mummified head of Grendel's father. That night, Grendel invades Hrothgar's great hall, kills the Geat who desecrated his father's head, and leaps from the second story, but is caught in a trap by Beowulf. Grendel, refusing capture, escapes by severing his captive arm, and dies near the site of his father's death, where his body is claimed by a mysterious webbed hand. Thereafter Hrothgar admits to Beowulf that he had killed Grendel's father for stealing a fish but had spared the child Grendel out of pity. Grendel's severed arm is kept by the Danes as a trophy. In revealing more about Grendel, Selma recounts that Grendel had once clumsily raped her and has protected her since that day; and Beowulf becomes her paramour.  The Danes are later attacked by [[Grendel's mother]], the Sea Hag; and Beowulf slays her with a [[sword]] from among her treasure, and then notices that the battle was being observed by child of Grendel and Selma. Later Beowulf, with Grendel's son watching, buries Grendel with ceremony. Shortly thereafter, Beowulf and his band of Geats leave Denmark by ship, having warned Selma that she must hide her son, lest the Danes destroy him.

He finds a job in [[London]] as assistant to Dana, an editor of self-help books for women.  James is going to marry in London and throws a party which he invites Olly to.

While at the party,  Olly meets, and immediately falls in love with Sarah while standing out on the balcony, but James thinks he has fallen in love with Becka.

Murray tells Olly that James has shagged somebody while already in a relationship with Sarah, but he doesn't believe it.  Olly goes to James's stag party, which is a bit wild, with two strippers dressed as policewomen. James admits that he has been unfaithful to Sarah, because she can't satisfy him completely, although he wants to marry her as her family has money and connections, and she is pretty. Olly wants to tell Sarah, but James handcuffs him to a pillar.  When he gets free, he goes to the wedding place, preventing another wedding from happening while on his way. Murray is making a fool of himself trying to earn some time. Olly finally arrives, and with the help of Becka, who says that James has been unfaithful with his secretary and she blames another girl.

Beru (film)
 A taluk-level office has been functioning without a regular head for sometime. A junior level official is in charge of the office. It has stuck to mandatory minimal âroutineâ work.   Goravayya is a poor, old, folk artist. Though living on a small income, he has been magnanimous in his own way to provide shelter to an orphan girl. He is stuck with a problem. The roots of a tree are affecting the stability of his small shelter. He has been repeatedly requesting the office for permission to fell the tree. âCome laterâ has been the standard reply.   At last, a regular officer arrives on posting. Being sincere and enthusiastic, this new officer starts tuning the office for proactive working. Even before he settles down, a ministerâs visit is announced. Arrangements have to be made in the Inspection Bungalow (IB). Much to his shock and surprise, nobody in the office knows about the IB! In the process of locating this IB, a scandal unfolds. The IB exists only on records: It is not there physically. Many irregularities and misappropriations come to light. The new officer is not able to report the matter to higher-ups because of his own indiscretion and emotional considerations. He tries to cover up by seeking approval for demolition of the âdilapidatedâ (non-existent) IB and for building a new one.  Meanwhile, the ministerâs visit is cancelled. But by then, the officer is deeply involved in the cover-up story. He is about to face the consequences. But his influential father-in-law comes to his rescue. He is asked to provide some cooked-up reasons for the IBâs âpresentâ condition so that the matter can be hushed up, and he is saved. Goravayya is proposed to be implicated as the âservant looking after IBâ responsible for its present condition. On seeing the reluctance of the officer to go ahead with this proposal, the junior official takes the responsibility for coaxing Goravayya for his being implicated. They go to see Goravayya only to find that his shelter has collapsed.

The Big White
 Travel agent Paul Barnell ([[Robin Williams]]) finds a body in a dumpster that, unbeknownst to him, was left there by [[Mafia]] hitmen. Heavily in debt and attempting to find a cure for his wife Margaret's ([[Holly Hunter]]) apparent [[Tourette Syndrome]], he stages a disfiguring animal attack with the body in order to cash in his missing brother's life-insurance policy, for which a corpse is required.  Local police are convinced, but promotion-hungry insurance agent Ted Waters ([[Giovanni Ribisi]]) is not. The hitmen who dumped the body are also in search of the corpse for proof to collect their payment. They take Margaret hostage to ensure that they will get the body. Meanwhile, Ted is having problems with his girlfriend, Tiffany ([[Alison Lohman]]), who he neglects as he works his way up in his firm.  Paul's missing brother Raymond ([[Woody Harrelson]]) returns home, beats him up, and demands a portion of the insurance money. By suggesting that Ted assaulted him, Paul speeds up the delivery of the million dollar insurance payment. He has the body exhumed and agrees to exchange it and a portion of the money for Margaret. Fearing that Raymond will attempt to kill Margaret to keep her quiet, Paul considers killing his brother in his sleep, but cannot bring himself to do so.  The next morning Paul leaves his brother asleep and meets the hit-men for the exchange. Raymond is angered at his brother's deception and arrives as well, and is told by the insurance agent, who has finally pieced together what has happened, about his million dollar policy. Raymond then pulls out a pistol and shoots Margaret in the back as she flees. He is in turn shot in the stomach by one of the hit-men ([[Tim Blake Nelson|Tim Nelson]]). Paul finds Margaret alive; he had hidden the insurance money in her jacket, and it stopped the bullet. The brothers say goodbye as Raymond dies. Paul tells Ted that he only committed fraud out of love for his wife, which appeals to Ted's renewed feelings for Tiffany; touched, he lets them go. Using the money, Paul takes Margaret on a tropical vacation.

After some days, the story moved to the engagement of Bhadra's sister (Revathi). The house is full of joy and laughter, awaiting Bhadra's return from college. However, when Bhadra returns, the family members are shocked. He has brought home distraught and frightened Anu, whom he introduces as his friend.  The marriage preparations continue, with everyone wondering who Anu is. Bhadra's uncle, however, cannot control his emotions. He wants his daughter to marry Bhadra, and is afraid Anu will spoil this. Eventually, Bhadra's uncle confronts him about Anu. Anu gets upset and an argument ensues. Later, as Bhadra and Anu go to a restaurant to eat, a gang comes. Bhadra chases them for a while and beats all of them up. Realizing he has left Anu behind, Bhadra returns to the restaurant. However, Anu is not there. Frightened, he was walking on road where he escaped from accident saved by his father ([[Murali Mohan]]). Finally, Bhadra's father forces him to tell them what is going on. Then a flashback begins.  When Raja visits his home village, Bhadra visits along with him. Anu, who returns from London, is impressed by Bhadra, who continually impresses her based on her tastes. He gets along well with Raja's and Anu's family. Meanwhile, Bhadra convinces them that he would make a prospective groom for Anu.  Anu's family, mainly her brother Surendra ([[Prakash Raj]]) and cousin, are involved in regional gangs in their village. When Anu takes Bhadra to the temple for a visit without Surendra's knowledge, a rival gang member group is attacked by Anu's cousin's group members, and one member of the rival group gets hold of Anu and threatens to kill her. In a swift action of bravery and skill, Bhadra knocks down the rival group member.  After this incident, Surendra gives Bhadra a talk about why things are so violent in the village. He explains how he is a master's degree holder from a prestigious university ([[BITS Pilani]]) and how his wife is also a master's degree holder. Unfortunately, due the nature of the villages, the rivalry is deadly and fatal. He ultimately says that even though the villages are violent, he will remain a noble person with high ideals.  After a few days though, in the most ungrateful manner and a show cowardice, the rival gang fights with fierce brutality, and the rival gang leader Veerayya ([[Pradeep Rawat (actor)|Pradeep Rawat]]) murders Raja's entire family except Anu. Bhadra makes the promise to Surendra that he will take up the responsibility of Anu and that he will eventually marry her. In the process, he also becomes a rival of Veerayya as he kills his younger brother Tulasi ([[Subbaraju]]) to protect Anu. When Veerayya finds out that Tulasi was killed by Bhadra, he decides to kill him instead of Anu.  Meanwhile, Surendra's men trace Anu and bring her to Bhadra's home. Feeling that she is not safe anymore here, Bhadra plans to send her abroad. Anu is not happy with his decision as she loves him. On the day Anu is supposed to leave to London, she meets Bhadra and Raja's friend at the airport. The girl tells Anu about Bhadra's devotion for her. She also knows that they chose Bhadra as Anu's bridegroom before her family was killed. She realizes she cannot leave Bhadra, and leaves the airport. She manages to find Bhadra, who is fighting the villains. After he defeats Veerayya, Bhadra and Anu embrace. Before Veerayya can kill Bhadra, one of Surendra's henchmen kills him. Then the movie ends.

Bionicle 3: Web of Shadows
 The film begins with the sight of the crystal prison of the Makuta. Suddenly, a mysterious voice calls his name and a talon scratches the prison, causing a small single shard to fall off and land in the Amaja circle from the previous film. Vakama, as a [[Turaga Dume|Turaga]], begins again the tale of the Toa Metru (from where it left off in the previous film), who sealed the evil Makuta and vowed to save the sleeping Matoran. But the task would not be easy, as the Makuta had called out to his legions, a horde of poisoners led by a ruthless king and a malevolent queen, and the noble Toa must now face a web of shadows.  The Toa Metru return to Metru Nui to rescue the [[List of characters in Bionicle#Matoran|Matoran]] trapped beneath the Colosseum. The [[Toa (Bionicle)|Toa]]'s ship crashes onto the shore. They survive and arrive at Metru Nui; however, the Toa follow the orders of Vakama and are trapped when spider-like creatures called [[List of Bionicle characters#Visorak|Visorak]] attack the Toa with their spinners, paralyzing them. Later, a Keelerak heads to the Coliseum to report to the horde's king, Sidorak. The king of the horde orders the Toa killed, but the Vortixx Roodaka, the viceroy and future queen of the hordes, persuades Sidorak to allow the Hordika venom to take effect before killing the Toa and bring her their bodies. As the Toa hang above in their [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoons]], the Toa are arguing with Matau blaming Vakama for leading them into a trap. As they hang, they are transformed into Toa Hordika, causing them to fall from their high altitude. Luckily, they are saved by the six beings who later introduce themselves as [[Rahaga]], led by Norik.  As Hordika, they cannot use their Mask or elemental powers and they are much more susceptible to their more bestial natures. As they'll remain Hordika forever if the Hordika venom is not neutralized in time, their only hope of changing back lies in the ancient hermit-like [[List of characters in Bionicle#Rahi|Rahi]] named Keetongu, whom no one has seen for millennia, nor do some believe his existence. Vakama, angry for being blamed and thinking that his friends don't understand how difficult it is to be a leader, storms off, determining to get the better of the other Toa by trying save the Matoran alone. However, he is captured by the Visorak, waking up in the Coliseum observation tower with Roodaka waiting for him to wake up. She gave him a proposal; if he leads the hordes, he can rule Metru Nui. Overpowered by his Hordika instinct, Vakama accepted her offer. He captures five of the six Rahaga, except Norik, and destroys much of the Great Temple, prompting the other Toa Hordika and Norik to quickly looking for Keetongu's whereabouts by following the inscription translated before the attack: "Follow the falling tears to Ko-Metru until they reach the sky."  The five Toa Hordika and Norik follow the stream of tears to Ko-Metru, where they end up in a cave and meet Keetongu. Meanwhile, Vakama is made master of the Visorak hordes and prepares to capture the other Toa. The Toa and Norik request Keetongu's help. He refuses, telling them that he could not start a battle on their behalf, but he could aid those loyal to the three virtues (unity, duty, and destiny), doing so being Keetongu's sworn duty. When Keetongu also refuses Matau's request for the Toa to be changed back, Norik explains that in order to rescue Vakama and the Matoran, they must learn to live and fight as Hordika, not be rid of their monstrous forms. However, the Toa's devotion to Vakama has touched the Rahi, so he agrees to join them in their fight.  Later, at the Coliseum, the final battle for Metru Nui begins. While the Toa distract the Visorak, Matau, believing he is responsible for Vakama's turning, confronts him while Keetongu fights Sidorak and Roodaka. Matau tries to reason with Vakama as Keetongu is struck down by Roodaka, though the blast does not kill him, and Roodaka leaves Sidorak to be killed by the Rahi. Matau reminds Vakama about his duty as a Toa and his destiny to rescue the Matoran, returning Vakama to his senses.  Norik frees his fellow Rahaga and joins the Toa, but they are defeated by Roodaka's Kahgarak and she demands them to give her their elemental powers. The five Toa fire their Rhotuka spinners, but have little effect on her. At this time, Vakama confronts her ready to fire his spinner, and Roodaka warns him all the assembled Visorak will destroy him and his friends if she's struck down. Vakama then orders all the Visorak to leave, telling them they were free of Roodaka's power, backing his claim with the power Sidorak had given him as commander of the hordes. Now without any aid, Roodaka simply stands and allows Vakama to fire his shot, as Norik realises too late the nature of the heart stone in her breastplate when Vakama's spinner strikes it. As Roodaka's body falls, a crimson hand encloses her and teleports her away, leaving behind the stone. Vakama realizes that the stone was Makuta's, carved from the same protodermis that the Toa sealed him with; in destroying the stone, Vakama had broken that seal and set the Makuta free, but Vakama is confident that they can stop him again.  The Toa then approach Keetongu, wishing him to change them back to their original forms. Keetongu was at first reluctant as he believed they were better off as Hordika, having gained control over their bestial sides. But Vakama persuaded him that it was their destiny to be Toa to guide the Matoran. Relenting to their request, Keetongu changes them back into Toa Metru. The scene changes, showing the Toa readying a fleet of airships which will take them to their new home of Mata Nui, named in honor of the Great Spirit. As they neared the Great Barrier, they notice the Makuta has indeed been freed, but Vakama is sure that Toa will always be there to fight back against him. At the movie's end, Turaga Vakama finishes his story to Takanuva, Jaller and Hahli, telling them that they must find their own destiny.  
A Bittersweet Life
 Kim Sun-woo ([[Lee Byung-hun]]) is a high-ranking enforcer for Kang ([[Kim Yeong-cheol (actor)|Kim Yeong-cheol]]), a cold and calculating crime boss to whom he is unquestionably loyal. The two share concerns over business tensions with Baek Dae-sik ([[Hwang Jung-min]]), a son from a rival family, and whose men had been beaten up by Sun-woo for overstaying their welcome at their nightclub. Kang, preparing to leave on a business trip, assigns Sun-woo to shadow his young mistress Hee-soo ([[Shin Min-ah]]), whom he fears is having an "affair" with another man. As he performs his dutyâfollowing Hee-soo, and escorting her to a music recital one dayâhe becomes quietly enthralled by the girl's beauty as glimpses into his lonely, empty personal life become prevalent. When he does come to discover Hee-soo and her lover at her home, he fiercely beats him and prepares to inform Kang, but his attraction to her causes him to hesitate. He thus spares the two on the condition that they no longer see each other again, earning him Hee-soo's enmity.  Later, a man asks Sun-woo to apologize for beating up Baek's men, but he refuses. As he relaxes in his apartment, he is suddenly kidnapped by Baek's henchmen to be tortured; they then receive new orders via phone and he is carried off to Kang, who has found out about his attempted cover-up of Hee-soo's affair. Kang's men torture him into confessing why he lied until he is left alone to think about his answer. A daring and violent escape follows, after which Sun-woo plans his revenge.  Sun-woo secretly delivers Hee-soo a gift to make amends, and then meets with some arms dealers for a handgun; the deal goes bad and Sun-woo ends up killing them. This incurs a vendetta with the brother of one of the dealers, who promptly sets out to find Sun-woo. Sun-woo then sets up a veiled rendezvous with Baek and kills him after a brief conversation, but he is viciously stabbed in the process. Bleeding, his violent shooting spree leads directly to Kang amidst one of his business meetings, where he vents bitterly over how badly he has been treated despite his years of loyalty. Kang does not answer, and instead asks if Sun-woo's actions were directly because of Hee-soo. Sun-woo kills Kang, prompting a shootout with Baek's henchmen, who have picked up his trail.  Sun-woo emerges as the only survivor of the battle, just as the arms dealer's brother appears. Dying from multiple gunshot wounds, Sun-woo calls Hee-soo and pauses to reminisce on his only day with her, when he had escorted her to her music recital: while watching her play her cello, he is overcome with emotion and smiles for the first time in the entire film. The arms dealer's brother then executes him.  The film ends with a continuation of an earlier scene, where Sun-woo looks out of a window at the city below him. After making sure he's alone, he begins to [[Shadowboxing|shadowbox]] his reflection in the glass, looking very happy.

 Following a [[car accident]], in which he believes he killed a boy, Arthur Seligman (JosÃ© Garcia) falls into a [[coma]] for several hours.  While in the coma, he pronounces incoherent sentences. At his awakening, he [[amnesia|does not remember]] what happened before the crash, and he does not know the meaning of the words he pronounced while unconscious. The nurse who assisted him, Isabelle Kruger ([[Marion Cotillard]]), recorded them in a notebook, which she gives to him. Arthur then tries to understand what happened, what those sentences mean, and begins to lose his grasp of reality.  
Black (2005 film)
 The film begins with Michelle McNally ([[Rani Mukerji]]), a [[Deafblindness|blind and deaf]] woman, visiting her former teacher Debraj Sahai ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]), who now has [[Alzheimer's disease]], in a hospital. The film then [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] to the past to her childhood.  Michelle was a girl who lost her eyesight and hearing after recovering from an illness at the age of two and exists in a black world where she is isolated in the darkness of her own existence, trapped by her inability to see, hear and express. She grows up becoming more and more frustrated by the black and dark world around her, making her a violent, uncontrollable eight-year-old child. Her parents, Paul and Catherine, are at their wits' end trying to control her, until one day the light shines through the end of the tunnel.  Debraj Sahai enters their lives, an elderly alcoholic teacher for the deaf and blind, Debraj sees himself as a magician and is a disillusioned eccentric man. He takes it upon himself to bring young Michelle into the light. He uses harsh methods, although always for Michelle's long-term benefit. Initially, his methods are met with disapproval by Michelle's father, who asks Debraj to leave. Although her father thinks he is gone, Debraj stays as the teacher while her father is away on business for 20 days. Her mother grudgingly approves of his continuation given her fear of Michelle being sent to an asylum. By the 20th day, Debraj manages to teach Michelle some words and better manners, but he has difficulty teaching her the meaning of words. When Michelle's father returns, Debraj packs his bags. At the very last moment, as he is walking towards the door suitcase in hand, Debraj gets frustrated with Michelle's continuing insolent behaviour and he throws her into a fountain full of water. Michelle suddenly takes to Debraj's lessons at that moment and begins to understand meaning. She is able to recognise her mother and father, and can vocalise the first syllables of some words small enough for her to understand. The McNallys decide to keep Debraj as Michelle's teacher.  Many years later, Michelle has learned a great deal, becoming relaxed and expressive, and she is even able to dance and expertly [[sign language|sign]]. Debraj convinces the principal of a university to grant her an interview which she passes and gets admission to pursue a Bachelor of Arts degree, the first deaf-blind person to do so at that university. Michelle moves away from home and lives with Debraj and one of her servants. Over the next 2 years, she struggles to gain her Bachelor of Arts degree, failing year after year, but she still maintains her spirit. One reason is that she must rely on Debraj completely for interpretation of the material and studying. This problem is overcome by the Principal of the school preparing the whole first-year Arts course of study in [[Braille]]. Another reason for her continuing failure is that her typing skills are lacking and typing is her only way to write down what she knows during exams. However, she also soon overcomes this deficiency through another flash of increased competence when she almost quits the university and gets into an argument with Debraj.  At the same time as Michelle suffers through and triumphs over her challenges, we also witness numerous other changes. Debraj begins to succumb to Alzheimer's, first forgetting the way out of the Principal's office and then forgetting Michelle and leaving her stranded during an ice cream celebration for her improved typing.  We also see Michelle reconcile with her sister Sara, who we find out was jealous of her parents' affection for Michelle throughout her life. After attending Sara's wedding, Michelle begins to wonder about love, which she has not experienced, and she even asks Debraj to kiss her on the lips. Debraj reluctantly does so but decides to leave Michelle on her own because of this demand and the position she has put him in. Twelve years after enrolment, Michelle does manage to gain her BA, and with her proud parents looking on her, she even gives a speech to the graduating class. Wearing no black graduation robe, she thanks her parents and her teacher and she announces that she will only wear the robe so that her teacher may see her first.  Debraj is in a mental hospital due to his almost complete inability to remember his past and even how to speak. Michelle visits him wearing her robe and we see glimmers of memory return as Debraj realises that she has graduated and even does a victory dance. As the window opens to the rain outside, we see Debraj's hand in Michelle's reaching into the rain, and we hear the teacher-student pair say the first syllable of the word "water", with echoes of the scene in which Michelle first begins understanding the meaning of words earlier in the movie. However this time, it is Debraj who is beginning to learn to speak and understand.  The movie ends with a scene of Michelle amongst a crowd of people all dressed in black carrying candles walking towards a church.  There is a voiceover of a letter Michelle has written to Debraj's friend Mrs Nair explaining that today was her teacher's first day of school, and that like hers, his alphabet began with "B L A C K".

She is the daughter of the Vampire King Kagan who has gathered an army of thralls, both vampire and human, in order to annihilate the human race. She was conceived when Kagan [[rape]]d her mother, and she later witnessed him killing her.  Sebastian, Vladimir, and Katarin are three members of the Brimstone Society, who fight vampires. They hear of a carnival freak who may be a Dhampir, so Vladimir plans to recruit her in order to kill Kagan. Kagan is also hunting for her, fearing she will interfere with his plans. Rayne escapes captivity at the carnival. On the road, she encounters and saves a family being attacked by vampires. A fortune teller reveals to Rayne that Kagan has become the most powerful vampire in the land and resides in a well-protected castle. She tells Rayne that Kagan seeks an ancient talisman, a mystical eye, and if she finds it, it would allow her to gain an audience with Kagan. Rayne sets out to the monastery to find it.  Rayne shelters for the night at the monastery and later sneaks away to where the talisman is guarded by a hammer-wielding, deformed monk. The talisman is further protected by booby traps, and when Rayne lifts it from its pedestal, the chamber floods with holy water. As Rayne hangs from the ceiling to avoid the water, the talisman falls from the box but she catches the eyeball. Examining it closely, the eye magically becomes absorbed into her own eye, and when she falls into the water she is somehow unaffected by it.  When she leaves the chamber, the monks explain the artifact is one of three body parts which came from an ancient vampire called [[Belial]], who had found a way to overcome the weaknesses of a vampire. The eye overcomes holy water; the rib overcomes the cross; and the heart overcomes sunlight. The parts have been hidden across the lands. As Kagan wants all these parts, it becomes the heroes' mission to stop him.  Rayne is brought to the headquarters of the Brimstone society and they agree to work together to kill Kagan. Katarin does not trust Rayne and betrays Brimstone to her father, Elrich, who has fallen in league with Kagan, but seeks to betray him and gain power for himself. The location of the heart talisman is known to Katarin as her grandfather hid it in water-filled caves. She seeks it out but Rayne fights and kills her for it.  With the talisman, Rayne attempts to gain an audience before Kagan, but he takes the heart and throws her in the dungeon. He plans to extract the eye as part of a ritual. He realizes too late Rayne had only given him an empty box and not the heart.  Sebastian and Vladimir intervene, battling Kagan and his minions, but both are fatally wounded, leaving Rayne in a final battle against Kagan. As Sebastian dies he fires a final bolt from his crossbow, but Kagan is too quick and is able to catch it. Rayne is able to summon her last reserves of strength and plunge the bolt into his heart. The battle ends. Rayne seats herself in Kagan's throne. The film ends when Rayne leaves the castle and goes to the mountains.  
Blood Rain (film)

This isolated and largely autonomous island begins to be plagued by a string of gruesome murders. However, it's not just the mounting death toll that is causing residents to worry, but the sadistic, methodical way in which the victims were killed. With the killer still on the loose, the government sends in special investigator Wonkyu to crack the case. While conducting his dogged investigation, he soon uncovers myriad hidden secrets, tracing the murders back to an incident that occurred some seven years earlier, in which the former owner of the mill was executed for practicing Catholicism. The townspeople, for their part, are convinced that the dead man's ghost has come back for revenge. As the young officer digs deeper into the island's dark past, Wonkyu discovers that there may be something even more frightening than the murders or the murdererâa truth that will make him question the depths of human nature.

Blessed by Fire
  A powerful Argentine anti-war film in the tradition of American [[Vietnam war]] films such as ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' and ''[[Coming Home (1978 film)|Coming Home]]'', ''Blessed By Fire'' is the story of two young men who were sent to fight the [[Falklands war|1982 war]] in the Falkland Islands and who return home bearing the brutal scars of war.  Twenty years after the war's end, journalist Esteban LeguizamÃ³n (GastÃ³n Pauls) is informed that Alberto Vargas (Pablo Ribba), one of the men he served with, has attempted suicide after suffering from years of depression brought on by his experiences in the war. Esteban visits the comatose Vargas at the hospital, and in a series of extended flashbacks, revisits the scene of Argentina's "unwinnable war."  The film depicts Esteban and fellow soldiers Vargas (Pablo Ribba, the man in the coma) and Juan (Cesar Albarracin), who are living in foxholes on the remote, windswept Falklands, battling hunger, boredom, abuse, and the deprivations of war as they await the arrival of British forces. A series of harrowing battle scenes with British forces ensues, and the Argentines realise the futility and violence of their mission. They are cannon fodder, pawns in a futile political game.  Back in the present, Esteban returns to the Falklands to come to terms with himself and the past. The emotional final scenes were shot on location in the Falklands, for the first time in Argentine film. As Esteban looks over the still off-limits battlefields filled with mines, live ammunition, and rusting military equipment, the futility of war is abundantly clear.

At the end of a regular fishing trip with Jack, Ennis tries to delay their next meeting. Jack's frustration erupts into argument, and Ennis blames Jack for being the cause of his own conflicted actions. Ennis begins to cry. Jack tries to hold him and there is a brief struggle, but they end up locked in an embrace. Jack watches as Ennis drives away. Some time later, Ennis receives a postcard he had sent to Jack, stamped "Deceased". He calls Lureen, who says that Jack died in an accident, when a tire he was changing exploded. As she is speaking, Ennis imagines that Jack was actually beaten to death by a gang of thugs, the fate that Ennis feared. Lureen tells Ennis that Jack wanted to have his ashes scattered on Brokeback Mountain, but she does not know where it is.  Ennis travels to meet with Jack's mother and father, and offers to take Jack's ashes to the mountain. The father refuses, preferring to have them interred in a family plot. Permitted by Jack's mother to see his childhood bedroom, Ennis finds the bloodstained shirt he thought he had lost on Brokeback Mountain. He discovers Jack kept it hanging with his own stained shirt from that summer's fight. Ennis holds both shirts up to his face, silently weeping. Jack's mother lets him keep the shirts. Later, 19-year-old Alma Jr. arrives at Ennis' trailer to tell her father she is engaged. She asks for his blessing and invites him to the wedding. Ennis asks her if her fiancÃ© really loves her and she replies "yes". After Alma leaves, Ennis goes to his closet, where his and Jack's shirts hang together, with a postcard of Brokeback Mountain tacked above. He stares at the ensemble for a moment, tears in his eyes, and murmurs, "Jack, I swear..."  
The Bridge of San Luis Rey (2004 film)
 The film centers on a basic premise: near [[Lima]], [[Peru]], at noon of Friday, 20 July 1714, a [[Simple suspension bridge|bridge]] woven by the [[Incas]] a century earlier collapsed at that particular moment, while five people were crossing it: DoÃ±a MarÃ­a, the Marquess of Montemayor; Pepita, her lady in attendance; Esteban, a scribe; Uncle PÃ­o; and a young child. The collapse was witnessed by Brother Juniper, a [[Franciscan]] [[monk]], who was on his way to cross it. Curious about why God would allow such a tragedy, he decides to take a scientific approach to the question. He set out to interview everyone he can find who knew the five victims. Over the course of six years, he has managed to compile a huge book, coming to the question whether we live our lives according to a plan or if there is no such thing as a bigger scheme.  
Brice de Nice
  The main character, a thirty-something [[surfer]] named Brice, lives for one thing: the perfect wave to surf, despite the fact that Nice lies on a completely waveless bay on the Mediterranean Sea. While waiting, he uses his rich father's money to throw outrageous parties and develop hilarious insults, as well as worship the film ''[[Point Break]]''.  When his father is arrested for [[money laundering]], however, things change: Brice's life comes crashing down around him, and after failing to hold down a job, he soon finds himself attempting [[bank robbery]]. He lands in hospital after the failed robbery attempt, and runs away from there with the guy whose scooter he hijacked while escaping the bank. The two become friends.  Stealing Brice's father's lawyer's wife's truck, the two cross France to the Atlantic coast to attend a world surfing championship at [[Soorts-Hossegor|Hossegor]]. With $100,000 in prize money, winning the tournament seems the only chance for the two to help themselves: Brice needs the money to support his lavish lifestyle, while his friend needs it for an operation in his foot (because he has only one enormous toe).  Brice "talks the talk, but doesn't walk the walk", and, predictably, fails at the surf competition. Though all seems lost, the two eventually find success of a sort: Brice surfs his perfect wave, while his friend sets off to travel the world with his newfound love.  
Breakfast on Pluto (film)
 The film is divided in over 36 chapters. In the fictional Irish town of Tyrellin, near the border of Northern Ireland in the late 1940s, cartoon robins narrate as Patrick Braden's mother, Eily Bergin, abandons him on the doorstep of the local parochial house where his father, Father Liam, lives. He is then placed with an unloving foster mother. Biologically male, a young Patrick is later shown donning a dress and lipstick, which angers his foster family. Patrick is accepted by his close friends Charlie, Irwin, and Lawrence, as well as by Lawrence's father, who tells Patrick Eily looked like blonde American movie star [[Mitzi Gaynor]].  The story moves to Patrick's late teen years. Patrick gets into trouble in school by writing explicit fiction imagining how he was conceived by his parents and by inquiring about where to get a sex change. Patrick comes out as transgender and renames herself Kitten, also using the name Patricia. She approaches Father Liam in [[Confession (religion)|confession]], asking about Eily, but is rebuffed. Kitten soon runs away from home, catching a ride with a [[glam rock]] band, Billy Hatchet and the Mohawks, and striking up a flirtation with leader Billy. Billy installs the lovestruck, homeless Kitten in a trailer home where she discovers he's hiding guns smuggled for the [[Irish Republican Army]]. Meanwhile, Irwin has begun to work with the IRA, much to the dismay of his now-girlfriend Charlie. Kitten dismisses Irwin's politics as "serious, serious, serious," but after Lawrence is killed by police detonating a suspected IRA car [[bomb]], she tosses the IRA gun cache into a lake. Billy abandons Kitten to flee the IRA, while Kitten plays crazy, so that she won't be shot.  Kitten next journeys to London to search for Eily, but initial inquiries prove fruitless. Penniless, she finds shelter in a tiny cottage in a park, only to find that it's a children's entertainment park for [[The Wombles]]. Kitten gets a job as a singing, dancing Womble, but immediately loses it when her sponsor and co-worker punches their boss. Forced into [[prostitution]], she is violently attacked by her first client, saving herself from strangulation by spraying him in the eyes with [[Chanel No. 5]] perfume.  At a diner, magician Bertie Vaughan asks her what she is writing in her notebook. She explains that it's the story of "The Phantom Lady" who was "swallowed up" by the big city, then reveals it's about the mother she is seeking. Bertie hires her to be his magician's assistant, turning her life story in to a hypnosis act. The two take a romantic day trip, but Kitten explains that she's not biologically female when Bertie tries to kiss her. Bertie says that he already knew this. Soon, Charlie finds Bertie's show and takes Kitten away.  Kitten goes to a club frequented by British soldiers and dances with a soldier, only to be injured when the club is bombed by the IRA. When police discover that Kitten is biologically male and Irish, she is arrested as a suspected terrorist. Beaten and prevented from sleeping, she writes a hyperbolic statement, shown in a fantasy spy film spoof sequence. The police's attitude soften, realizing she is innocent, and they release her. With no place to go, Kitten begs to stay in the police station, but is tossed to the street.  Kitten is again forced to turn tricks, but is saved by one of the cops who interrogated her. He brings her to a [[peep show]] where she transforms herself into a blonde. Her repentant father finds her and in a scene that mirrors their confessional scene, professes his love and tells Kitten where to find Eily. She goes to her house posing as a telephone company market researcher and discovers a younger half-brother whose name is also Patrick. She faints upon meeting Eily, but after reviving does not reveal her identity.  When Irwin is killed by the IRA, Kitten goes home to tend to a pregnant Charlie and reconcile with her priest father. The town reacts against the unwed mother and her transgender friend living with the priest by firebombing the parish house. Kitten and Charlie flee to London. In the final scene, they run into pregnant Eily and little Patrick at the doctor's office, where Charlie is getting prenatal care. Kitten is friendly, but still doesn't reveal who she is.  
Break Through!
    Romeo, A.K.A. Kosuke Matsuyama ([[Shun Shioya]]), is a second-year high school student. A nice, normal, nonviolent type, he suddenly finds himself in the middle of a rampaging crowd of Korean boys, outraged by insults perpetrated by several of his idiotic classmates on two Korean girls. He makes a narrow escape, but soon after, he and his best bud Yoshio (Keisuke Koide) are sent by their home-room teacher to invite the Korean students to a friendly soccer game as a way of restoring the peace.  Trembling like black-uniformed leaves, they enter enemy territory, where Kosuke encounters a doll-faced, but serious-looking girl (Erika Sawajiri) playing a Korean folk song, "Imjin River," on a flute. He and Yoshio are also nearly lynched by her older brother Lee Ang Son (Sosuke Takaoka) and his gang, but he is already smittenâand eager to learn that haunting tune.  The story concentrates on Kosuke's struggle to not only master a song, but win the love of a girl who seems to live in an alien, hostile world. Meanwhile, Ang Son and his crew are street-fighting with Japanese toughs as if playing a contact sport, with one side scoring hits, then the other. He is macho to a fault, but when he learns that his sweet-heart (Kyoko Yanagihara) is pregnant and determined to keep the baby, he faces a choice that makes him quail: grow up or cop out.  
The Brothers Grimm (film)
 Will and Jake Grimm are traveling [[Confidence trick|con-artists]] who arrive in [[French Revolutionary Wars|French-occupied]] Germany during the early 19th century. They ride into the town [[Karlstadt am Main|Karlstadt]] to rid the town of a witch's ghost. However, after killing the "ghost", it is revealed that the Brothers Grimm have actually set up fake demons and monsters to trick the village. Afterwards, as they are celebrating at an inn, Italian torturer Cavaldi takes them to the French General Delatombe. Delatombe forces them to solve a mystery: the girls of the small village of Marbaden are going missing and the villagers are convinced that supernatural beings are responsible. The Brothers are charged with finding out who is responsible, under the assumption that it is the work of con artists like themselves. However, they soon discover that it is in fact the work of a real supernatural force: a beautiful, yet dangerous, 500-year-old, [[Thuringia|Thuringian]] Queen stealing young girls to restore her own beauty.  Long ago, King [[Childeric I]] came to the forest to build a city while his Queen experiments with [[black magic]] to gain eternal life. The [[bubonic plague]] comes and she builds a high tower to avoid it, while her husband and everyone below her perishes. She did not understand the Plague was carried by wind and soon rotted away as she decayed over the years. Her spell granted her immortal life, but not the youth and beauty to go along with it. Her youthful appearance now only exists in her mirror, the source of her life, as an illusion and nothing more. She needs to drink the blood of 12 young women to regain her beauty, 10 have already been reported missing.  The queen is working an enchantment to regain her beauty with the aid of her [[werewolf]] huntsman with a magic axe, crow familiars, and various creatures in the forest. The Brothers Grimm, with the help of Angelika, a knowing huntress from the village, and Cavaldi intend to The Mirror Queen. After another girl goes missing, Cavaldi takes the Grimms and Angelika back to Delatombe. Because they have failed, Cavaldi may kill both of the Grimms, but after convincing Delatombe that the magic in the forest is actually caused by German rebels, he sends them back, while Cavaldi stays behind with Angelika in the village. Jake gets into the tower, but another girl named Sasha is captured, despite Angelika and Cavaldi's efforts to save her.  In the tower, Jake notices 12 crypts in which the twelve victims must lay. When Sasha's body comes up from a well, the werewolf takes her to a tomb. After rescuing Sasha and taking the wolfman's magic axe, the Grimms return to the village. The magic axe is the only thing of which the trees in the forest are afraid. Delatombe captures the Brothers and believes them to be frauds. French soldiers begin burning down the forest and Cavaldi expresses his sympathy to the brothers, but they are eventually saved by Angelika. The werewolf is revealed to be Angelika's father, who is under the Queen's command by a spell. Angelika is drowned by her father, becoming the 12th victim. The Brothers reach the tower while the Queen breathes an ice wind which puts out the forest fire. Delatombe notices that the Grimms have escaped and goes after them with Cavaldi. When Cavaldi refuses to kill the Grimms, Delatombe shoots him, but is impaled by Will.  The [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] ensues with the Mirror Queen's death as Jake shatters the enchanting mirror in the tower. The werewolf resumes the form of Angelika's father (the woodsman) and destroys the rest of the mirror by leaping from the window with it, followed by the bewitched Will, who is trying to stop him. Outside, Cavaldi, having been protected from the bullet by the Grimms' faux-magic armor, recites an Italian curse. The tower falls apart. Jake wakens Angelika. The other 11 girls and Will are also restored. With the menace gone and their daughters returned, the villagers celebrate joyously and in thanks to the brothers. Cavaldi stays in the village and joins in the celebration. The Grimms discuss pursuing a new profession, presumably writing fairy tales.  
Broken Flowers
 Don Johnston ([[Bill Murray]]), a former ''[[Don Juan]]'' who made a small fortune in the computer industry, wants to live in quiet retirement. He is content to lounge around watching old movies and listening to classical or [[easy listening]] music. His current girlfriend, Sherry ([[Julie Delpy]]), is ending their relationship and moving out of his house when a letter in a pink envelope arrives.   After she walks out, Don reads the letter; it purports to be from an unnamed former girlfriend, informing him that he has a son who is nearly nineteen years old, and who may be looking for him. Initially, Don does not intend to do anything about it, but his busybody neighbor Winston ([[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]), who is a mystery novel enthusiast, urges Don to investigate. Winston researches the current locations of the five women most likely to have written the letter and gives Don the information along with maps and flight reservations, and persuades him to visit them.  Ultimately Don meets with four women (the fifth one had died before the events of the film), each encounter worse than the last and each woman damaged in some way: * Laura ([[Sharon Stone]]) works as a closet and drawer organizer and is the widow of a race car driver. She clearly has issues with men, coming across as grasping and overly eager, which she has passed on to her teenage daughter, Lolita ([[Alexis Dziena]]), who is a flirt, parading nude in front of Don on their very first meeting. That night, Laura sleeps with Don. * Dora ([[Frances Conroy]]) is a [[realtor]]. Once a "[[flower child]]" of the 1960s, she has reversed to the opposite extreme and is now apparently resigned to a very uptight existence in her otherwise happy marriage to Ron ([[Christopher McDonald (actor)|Christopher McDonald]]). * Carmen Markowski ([[Jessica Lange]]) works as an "[[Humanâanimal communication|animal communicator]]."  Don recalls how she was formerly so passionate about becoming a lawyer.  But "passion is a funny thing," she says. She is cold to Don and has a relationship with her secretary ([[ChloÃ« Sevigny]]). * Penny ([[Tilda Swinton]]) lives in a rural area amongst bikers.  She still holds a grudge against Don, and apparent rage overall. When Don asks her whether she has a son, she becomes furious, which results in one of her biker friends punching Don out. The next morning, Don finds himself in his car, in the middle of a field, with a nasty cut near his left eye.  Later, Don stops at a florist to buy flowers from a young woman named Sun Green ([[Pell James]]) who treats his cut.  Don leaves the flowers at the grave of the fifth woman, Michelle Pepe, whom Don originally thought might be the mother before finding out she had died five years prior.   Finally, Don returns home where he finds a pink letter from Sherry, admitting she still likes him. He discusses the trip and second letter with Winston, who theorizes that Sherry might have written the original letter as a hoax. He then goes home to compare the two letters.   Don then meets a young man in the street ([[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]]) who he suspects may be his son. He buys him a meal, but when he remarks that the young man believes that Don is his father, the young man becomes agitated and flees. Don attempts to chase the man but gives up, standing in the middle of a crossroads. Don watches a [[Volkswagen Beetle]] drive past from which a young man (Homer Murray) in the passenger seat makes eye contact with Don, while the same music Don has listened to on his trip plays from the passing car.  
Bubble (film)
 In a town near the [[Ohio River]], Martha (Debbie Doebereiner), a homely middle-aged single woman, works at a doll factory and cares for her elderly, disabled father. Martha regularly drives her younger co-worker, Kyle (Dustin James Ashley), to and from work. Kyle is an intensely shy, quiet young man in his early 20s, who suffers from [[social anxiety disorder]] and lives with his television-obsessed single mother. Martha, who appears to have no social outlets or friends outside of work, has become attached to Kyle, showing concern for his welfare, trying to draw him out, and telling him he is her "best friend". Although the withdrawn Kyle opens up a little bit to Martha, he does not act as interested in her as she is in him.  In order to meet demand, the doll factory hires Rose (Misty Dawn Wilkins), an attractive young woman Kyle's age who is the single mother of a toddler. Kyle and Rose are mutually attracted to each other, and begin to spend time together during their breaks at work, to Martha's chagrin as she herself is pushed aside and unable to have her usual interactions with Kyle. Martha grudgingly agrees to drive Rose to her second job as a housekeeper for a wealthy client, but Martha becomes further irritated with Rose when Rose takes advantage of her client's absence to take a long bath in the client's [[Jacuzzi]]. Rose also claims that a watch she stole from her client was a gift. Martha complains to Kyle about Rose's behavior.  Despite her dislike of Rose, Martha accepts the opportunity to earn some extra money by babysitting for Rose while Rose goes on a date. Martha only learns that Rose's date is Kyle when he arrives at Rose's home to pick her up, causing Martha to become upset. During their date, Rose and Kyle go to Kyle's house where Rose, unbeknownst to Kyle, steals money that he has been saving and hiding away in his bedroom. When Kyle drops Rose off, he decides not to go inside with her because he felt a "weird vibe" from Martha earlier. Right after Rose enters the house, her ex-boyfriend Jake appears and accuses Rose of stealing money and marijuana from his house. Rose and Jake have a heated argument in front of Martha. After Jake leaves, Martha asks Rose if he is the father of her child, and Rose angrily tells her to mind her own business.  The next morning the police arrive at Rose's house after neighbors hear her child crying and call them. They find Rose dead of apparent strangulation, with no sign of forced entry. A [[detective]] questions both Jake and Kyle, who each claim to know nothing about the murder. Meanwhile, Martha  [[Pawnbroker|pawns]] jewelry (which she says she inherited from family members) and spends the money on fishing equipment and a trip to the beauty parlor. She then takes the fishing equipment to Kyle's house and gives it to him as a gift; he tells her of Rose's murder and, apparently surprised by the news, she says she knows nothing. She is later questioned by a detective and maintains her innocence, even when he tells her that the fingerprints found on Rose's neck match her own. Martha is arrested for Rose's murder.  Kyle visits Martha in prison. Martha pleads with Kyle to help her, swearing she did not murder Rose and doesn't know what happened, though she mentions a headache and Rose's rudeness. Kyle is skeptical of her story. Later, in her jail cell, Martha sees a bright light, followed by a vision of Rose's dead body and herself standing over Rose. Kyle's mother takes Rose's job at the doll factory and Kyle's humdrum life working two jobs continues as it did before.  The DVD release of the film also contains a deleted scene in which Martha has a [[Computed tomography|CAT scan]] revealing that she has a severely [[malignant]] [[tumor]] in her brain. The doctor explains that the tumor could cause [[Fainting|blackouts]] and highly abnormal behavior.

Le Building
 Inside a crooked, [[brick]] [[apartment complex]], a burly man, with a [[Russian military]] [[Military uniform|uniform]] hanging on his wall, [[showers]], while belting out a song in his native tongue. A short, elderly woman in the apartment next door finds this to be a nuisance. She rouses from her chair and knocks on the wall between their two rooms. Her knocking causes a [[porcelain]] [[dolphin]] figurine to fall to the ground and shatter. This startles her [[cat]], who then jumps from their third story [[window sill]]. The cat lands on a [[Clothes horse|clothes rack]] underneath and bounces onto the [[Motorcycle helmet|helmet]] of an oncoming [[motorcyclist]].  Gripping onto the helmet for its life, the cat causes the motorcyclist â enroute on a [[pizza delivery]] â to swerve uncontrollably in the road. A [[bus]] barely misses hitting them â and then collides into a nearby [[parking meter]]. The motorcyclist, unable to stop, inadvertently drives into the apartment complex. Crashing up the stairs, his vehicle comes to a sudden halt on the second floor, sending a small pizza through the [[mail slot]] of a closed door. A naked, obese woman steps out of her [[bathtub]] and slips on the pizza. She grabs hold of a [[Shelf (storage)|shelf]] above her, but the shelf breaks. A [[radio]] that had been perched on the shelf is catapulted through an open window and hits a [[Mobile crane|crane]] [[Heavy equipment operator|operator]] in the face.  Upon collision, the crane operator passes out. Crumpling forward onto the crane's [[Control panel (engineering)|control panel]], the operator unconsciously pushes two [[levers]] forward, causing the crane to rotate. A giant [[magnet]] hanging from a [[wire]] is suspended from the crane and attaches itself to the parked bus. As the [[bus driver]] stands outside in the road with his back turned, his vehicle is carried away. The Russian man, still singing, notices the bus hurtling towards his window. He lets out a startled scream. The old woman, still pounding against the wall, hears a loud crash. She mutters something irritably, and with a "hmph", walks back to her chair. Outside, the bus continues circling through the air, the screaming Russian man plastered against its window. The building has almost entirely been destroyed. A single [[Beam (structure)|beam]] holds up the old woman's room â she presumably remains oblivious to the catastrophe outside.

After finding out that the businessman who Rakesh approached has used his idea to make money, he and Vimmi con him and take the money that they believe is rightfully theirs.  Once they realise how easy it is to con people, they decide to run some more cons to raise money to make it to Bombay.  Unfortunately for India, they find the lifestyle too exciting to give up.

The Business (film)
 The film is narrated by Frankie (Dyer), a young [[everyman]] living in [[SE postcode area|South East London]] during the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher era]] of the 1980s, with little hope of ever making anything of himself, yet he dreams of ''"being somebody"'' and escaping his lonely, dreary lifestyle. After severely beating his mother's [[Physical abuse|abusive]] boyfriend, he becomes a fugitive, and through family connections escapes to the Costa Del Sol. His job there is to deliver a bag containing money to ''"Playboy Charlie"'' (Hassan), an ex-pat and criminal-on-the-run, a suave and dapper man who is very successful in Spain and runs his own nightclub and drugs business and lives a life of luxury. Impressed by Frankie's honesty in not opening the bag, Charlie takes a liking to Frankie, introduces him to his business associates, including the [[psychopath]]ic Sammy (Bell), and invites him to remain in Spain and work as his [[Chauffeur|driver]].  Frankie discovers that they are in fact the ''"[[Peckham]] Four"'', wanted for [[armed robbery]] back in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. However, Frankie decides he prefers an exciting life of sun, drugs, women, money, fast cars, designer clothes, and a reputation, as opposed to being a nobody back in [[London]]. Frankie soon accepts and becomes involved in the business of smuggling [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] across the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] from [[Morocco]], in which children are used although the children are sometimes shot dead by the [[Spanish Navy]] patrolmen.  The film then follows the rise-and-fall pattern common to many gangster films, showing first the criminals living the high life as their cannabis trade is booming, and then the downfall as greed and paranoia (not helped by the obvious attraction between Frankie and Sammy's beautiful [[trophy wife]] Carly) introduce conflict between them, and eventually split them up. Charlie and Frankie decide to go into business alone, importing [[cocaine]] instead of cannabis through drop-offs from [[Colombia]]n aeroplanes, but this is the cause of the final catastrophe. Not only do they both become increasingly addicted to the drug itself, but also the local mayor, who had been happy to ignore the cannabis trade but had warned them not to import cocaine, discovers what they are doing and uses the weight of the law to shut them down and close their businesses. An assassination attempt on the mayor's life ends in failure, and the gruesome beheading of one of the gang.  Six months later Frankie and Charlie are homeless thugs, reduced to stealing in order to survive. While organising a disappointing reunion party at Charlie's old bar (which Frankie's former [[heroin]] addict friend Sonny is now running), Frankie meets the scheming Carly again and decides to make one last deal. He invites Sammy in on a pick-up, but while both intend to betray the other, Carly has given Sammy a pistol with an empty clip. Sammy tries to shoot Frankie, who in turn attacks him with a rock. The fight ends abruptly as Spanish Navy patrolmen's gunfire fatally shoots Sammy. Frankie escapes through a sewage pipe. Frankie emerges from the sewer to meet Carly, who had masterminded the whole thing, finally getting his happy ending. But at the last minute, he realises he can't trust Carly when he finds another pistol in her handbag amongst their money, so he knocks her out and drives off triumphantly into the sunset on his own.

Bus Conductor (2005 film)
 The story, set in the Malabar culture, revolves around Zakir Hussain aka Kunjakka ([[Mammootty]]). This bus conductor lords over the family that has a motley cast to it - mother (Bindu Panicker), sister (Poornima), her husband ([[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]]), son ([[Jayasurya]]), daughters and his own sister Selina ([[Mamta Mohandas]]). Then there are his bus mates (Kalpana and [[Harisree Ashokan]])and the villain police sub inspector Sajan George [[Adithya (actor)|Adithya Menon]].  Being a good man, Kunjakka is faced with all kinds of troubles and responsibility. On the one hand he has to take on the wily cop Sajan George, who also runs a bus company on the sly. Then the problems within the family come to hand. Najeebâs (Jayasurya) dalliance with a local girl (Bhavana) ends in her becoming pregnant. But Najeeb goes to Dubai leaving the girl in the lurch. So the responsibility of looking after her also falls on Kunjakkaâs shoulders. There are misunderstandings in the family and his only solace is Noorjahan (Nikita Thukral).  The story then is about how Kunjakka unties all the knots of distrust and disappointments. It is a story that is overweighed by treacle-soaked sentiments. In fact, the maudlin nature of the script makes you groan. Starting with Mammootty none of the artistes have let down the story. Every one chips in efficiently. But the director Vinu has chosen the wrong path. He gets himself tied up through over-the-top sentiments.  Music is by [[M. Jayachandran]].

Puzzled about its origin, they debate its purpose, considering whether it might be a practical joke played by friends of their 12-year-old son, Pierrot, or the work of fans of Georges, who hosts a literary television show. A second tape arrives, accompanied by a childlike drawing of a person with blood streaming out of his mouth. Similar drawings are mailed to Georges's workplace and Pierrot's school. Disturbed, the Laurents turn to the French police, who determine the tapes are too harmless to be considered criminal activity. The Laurents host a dinner party that is interrupted by the delivery of another videotape, with a crude drawing of a chicken bleeding at its neck. When Anne discloses the stalking to their friends, Georges puts the tape in the [[VCR]], and finds it shows the estate where he grew up.  Georges begins to have vivid dreams about Majid, a boy he knew in childhood. Majid's [[Algerians in France|Algerian]] parents worked as farmhands on Georges's family estate but disappeared in the [[Paris massacre of 1961]]. Feeling responsible for Majid, Georges's parents intended to adopt him, but the process was never finalised. Suspecting Majid might be responsible for the tapes, Georges visits his ailing mother, who surprisingly professes not to remember Majid well. When the Laurents receive another tape, revealing an [[HLM]] apartment, Georges tells Anne he has a suspect in mind, but will not say who until he can confirm his suspicion. Anne responds with shock at what she sees as his lack of trust.  Following the last tape's clues, Georges locates the apartment off Avenue LÃ©nine in [[Romainville]] and finds Majid there. Majid denies knowledge of the tapes or drawing, but Georges does not believe him and threatens him. A hidden camera recorded the conversation with Majid, who breaks down crying after Georges left, and tapes of the encounter are sent to Anne and Georges's employer. Georges explains to Anne that he was six when his parents were planning to adopt Majid and that he did not want it to happen; he told lies about Majid, who was sent away. When Pierrot disappears, the Laurents frantically contact the police, who check Majid's apartment and arrest Majid and Majid's son, though they deny involvement in kidnapping. Pierrot returns to his family, having spent time with friends, and hints to Anne that he thinks she is too close to Pierre, a family friend.  Majid calls Georges and asks him to come back to the apartment. When Georges arrives, Majid denies having sent the tapes, says he wanted Georges present, and kills himself by slashing his throat. Georges confesses to Anne that as a boy, he had claimed Majid was coughing up blood and convinced Majid to kill the family's rooster, falsely claiming his father wanted him to. The police confirm the cause of death as suicide, but Majid's son appears at Georges's workplace to confront him. Believing the son is responsible for the tapes, Georges threatens him to cease surveillance, but the son replies he was not involved with the tapes and wanted to know how Georges felt about being responsible for a death. Later, Majid's son converses with Pierrot after school.  
The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (2005 film)
 The plot is largely similar to that of the original film with extra dialogue scenes. The film tells the story of the deranged Dr. Caligari and his faithful sleepwalking Cesare and their connection to a string of murders in a German mountain village, Holstenwall. The movie features a "[[frame story]]" in which the body of the plot is presented as a flashback, as told by Francis.  The narrator, Francis, and his friend Alan visit a carnival in the village where they see Dr. Caligari and Cesare, whom the doctor is displaying as an attraction. Caligari brags that Cesare can answer any question he is asked. When Alan asks Cesare how long he has to live, Cesare tells Alan that he will die tomorrow at dawn â a prophecy which turns out to be fulfilled.  Francis, along with his girlfriend Jane, investigate Caligari and Cesare, which eventually leads to Jane's kidnapping by Cesare. Caligari orders Cesare to kill Jane, but the hypnotized slave refuses after her beauty captivates him. He carries Jane out of her house, leading Jane's father and brother on a chase.  Cesare is stabbed to death after being pursued by Jane's brother, and Francis discovers that Caligari had created an illusion of Cesare to distract him.  Francis discovers that "Caligari" is the head of the local insane asylum, and with the help of his colleagues discovers that he is obsessed with the story of a medieval Dr. Caligari, who used a [[somnambulist]] to murder people as a traveling act.  After being confronted with the dead Cesare, Caligari breaks down and reveals his mania and is imprisoned in his own asylum.  The "[[twist ending]]" reveals that Francis' flashback is his fantasy: The man he claims is Caligari is indeed his doctor in the asylum, who, after this revelation of the source of his patient's delusion, claims to be able to cure him.  
The Busy Little Engine
 The [[preschool]]-age DVD tells the story of a wooden toy train who pretends to be a real [[train]]. The main character, Busy Little Engine, appears alternately as a wooden toy train in a playroom and as a full-scale-size train in real-world backgrounds. With its intentionally gentle pacing and static camera work, it has been called "a young child's [[picture book]] come-to-life".  Busy Little Engine pretends to be a real train but does not actually know what real trains do. This presents a problem which is soon solved with the help of Busy Little Engine's puppet friend, Pig, and the off-screen [[narrator]].  Through the course of the show, Busy Little Engine and Pig explore the everyday world using [[role-playing]] and [[imagination]]. Viewers learn about tangible topics such as [[raw goods]], [[finished materials]] and basic [[railroad operations]] along with esoteric topics such as pretending, taking turns, and learning from others.

Calling All Engines!
 One summer day, the Fat Controller announces that a new airport is to be built on Sodor, for more holiday makers than ever, but [[Arry and Bert|'Arry and Bert]] biff their trucks into Thomas and Percy, also there. At the timberyard, they boast that they got a very important job because Diesels are better than steam engines, and Thomas biffs them so hard, their timber falls onto the tracks. When Diesel confronts them, giving a similar boast, Thomas gives him bananas to pull, but the Tidmouth Sheds did not get rebuilt (after destruction) on time. As a result, all the engines are forced to sleep on different parts on the Island. That night, a huge storm sweeps across the island and the Sodor Suspension Bridge collapses. The next morning, the Fat Controller makes the engines clear up the storm damage before the work can continue.  At the suspension bridge, a beam needs to be placed and an exhausted Thomas is nearly unable to carry it, but using all his strength, he manages to lower the beams into place. Later, Diesel biffs Thomas's flatbed so paint splashes all&nbsp;over Thomas. The matter escalates until all the engines are fighting. By the end of the day, The Fat Controller furiously threatens the railway to be closed permanently.

She then finds herself running her father's wedding magazine while he recovers from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].

The future of magazine is at risk as hungry vultures wait to take over her father's media conglomerate.  Pippa and her straight-laced father have never truly gotten along since her mother died. To complicate things, Pippa becomes involved in a [[love triangle]] with her father's right-hand man Ian ([[David Sutcliffe]]) and the free-spirited photographer Hemingway Jones ([[Taye Diggs]]).

The Call of Cthulhu (film)
 The film adheres very closely to Lovecraft's story, but there are a few changes. The sailors aboard the ''Emma'' first encounter the ''Alert'' abandoned at sea, rather than crewed by [[Cthulhu]] cultists and taken over by ''Emma''s crew after a violent confrontation as in the original story. Additionally, the film depicts the narrator present at the time of his great-uncle's death, who dies peacefully in his sleep, rather than being summoned upon the mysterious death of his great-uncle, who was presumably killed by Cthulhu cultists in the original short story. The narrator (Matt Foyer) notes that Inspector Legrasse, who had directed the raid on cultists in backwoods [[Louisiana]], died before the narrator's investigation began.  In the original story, the narrator does not seem to end in a lunatic asylum or experience any mysterious nightmares himself.

Camp Slaughter
  During a [[sing-along]] at Camp Hiawatha in 1981, two revelers sneak away to have sex, and are killed by an unseen assailant. Twenty-four years later, four friends (Angela, Jen, Mario, and Vade) are driving through the area on their way to [[Boston]]. The quartet becomes lost (passing the same sign several times) and their [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]] breaks down after night comes unusually early. All the electronics fail to work, and the group is thrown into hysterics when screams emanate from the surrounding forest, and the vehicle is pelted with debris, prompting them to spend the night in it.  In the morning, the travelers are found by campers and counselors from Hiawatha, and invited to stay at the camp, which looks like it has not changed since the 1980s. As the quartet is shown around (noticing how [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] the place is) someone murders any campers who go off on their own. That night, the killer rampages through the facilities, butchering everyone except the quartet. At dawn, the travelers awaken to discover that nothing appears to be wrong, and that everyone is alive again.  Daniel and Ivan, a pair of counselors who are aware of what is going on, find the four, and explain that the camp is in a [[time loop]], stuck repeating the day of the killing spree. To prove they are telling the truth, the counselors take the others to witness the first murder, a strangulation in the woods, which they have never been able to stop, despite their best efforts. The time-displaced four try to leave on their own, but the SUV will not appear until nightfall, and walking away just brings them back to Hiawatha. Daniel and Ivan state that they are limited in what they can do, but with the help of outsiders, they may be able to break the loop, and move on to whatever fate awaits them.  The night of the massacre, it is revealed that Daniel and Ivan are the murderers, and that they manipulated Michelle and Ruben, a pair of outcasts, into helping them with their [[thrill killing]]. The psychopaths intend to have the travelers take their place in the cycle, which they believe they can achieve by murdering them, so they can get out. Mario and Vade die, but Angela and Jen manage to kill Daniel and Ivan. The girls go to the SUV, where Lou, the [[Groundskeeping|groundskeeper]], is attacking Michelle and Ruben. Lou snaps Michelle's neck, and exposits that he took out the perpetrators of the original massacre minutes after it occurred. A wounded Ruben then shoots an arrow into Angela's chest, and is stomped to death by Lou as Jen escapes in the SUV.  Three years later, Jen has become a successful writer, and while in her office one day, she receives an email. It is from Daniel and Ivan, who have written that they cannot wait to meet their "favorite author" soon.

 Gavin Ransom (Noah Wyle) is a successful real estate developer who has made a tidy fortune putting up gated communities filled with expensive suburban homes all over California. Ransom intends to put up another such development in the as-yet-untouched hillsides of Northern California's Marin County, and, just as he's expected, a number of folks living nearby are objecting to the project, including his sister Olive (Illeana Douglas), an environmental activist who has sided with longtime resident Eileen Boatwright (Cloris Leachman) and progressive lawyer Sybil (Jane Lynch) against the development. Olive and her compatriots get some unexpected support when Zoe Tripp (Kate Mara), a modern folk singer and the daughter of old-school Marin County hippies (Keith Carradine and Valerie Perrine), takes an interest in their protests and begins singing out against Gavin's proposal with guitar in hand. Gavin unexpectedly finds himself growing powerfully infatuated with Zoe, and Olive, a long-closeted lesbian, is equally taken with her; consequently, as the siblings battle against building several dozen cookie-cutter mansions, they also wage a private war for the affections of the young songstress.<ref>[http://www.qwipster.net/californians.htm Leo, Vince.

The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie
 This movie starts when, atop the roof of an [[observatory]] at their cloud-filled home of Care-a-lot, the Care Bears hear Wish Bear's story of how she (as a Cub) found her new friend, a wishing star named Twinkers.  The Care Bears are touched by this tale, but are a bit worried when she uses Twinkers' inherent power to wish them all some popcorn.  Cheer Bear raises concern that this may be a frivolous use of Twinkers' power.  Wish Bear, however, assures everyone that she is a trained professional.  The next day, Wish Bear uses the wishing power to help her friends.  She wishes for plenty of rainbow [[tree sap|sap]] for Share Bear, and for Grumpy Bear's rocket to have "zoom", but the wishes backfire when the sap overflows and the rocket spins out of control.  A monthly meeting of Care-a-lot's steering committee (with Champ Bear presiding) reveals a problem with the Caring Meter.  The machine, which measures how much caring there is in Care-a-lot, has moved towards the raincloud side.  Wish Bear suggests using her wishes, but is rejected since not all of them work as intended; they didn't like their wishes ("I Wish").  Disappointed, she decides to wish for other bears who like wishing as much as she does.  This causes three new bears to arrive in Care-a-lot: Me Bear, Messy Bear, and Too Loud Bear.  Everyone is pleased to welcome the new neighbours at first, but things soon get out of control.  The new bears unwittingly make a huge mess of everything (especially when the huge mansion they asked for causes pollution). Then, after a confrontation with them at a picnic ("Get a Lot") Wish Bear accidentally wishes Twinkers away to the new bears; they soon abuse the star's power with an amusement park focusing on Me Bear, a mud pie for Messy Bear, and a huge noisy motorcycle for Too Loud Bear.  Once the new bears finally realise their problem, they try to fix it with more wishes, but to no avail&mdash;Care-a-lot becomes a blank white space (wishing that all of this was gone), the bears begin to glow in color (wishing for everything to be back how it was, but with more color), Grumpy Bear turns black and white (wishing for less color), and Messy Bear turns into Messy Cub (wishing for everything to be like it used to be).  When they try to wish Twinkers back to Wish Bear, the star ultimately loses his power from exhaustion (because they had been pushing him much too hard).  Wish Bear uses Grumpy Bear's rocket to bring him to the Big Wish, a grandmother star, in the sky. Big Wish restores his power, but not before Wish Bear assures her that she has learned her lesson, which is wishing is fun, but it is far more important to work hard to achieve your dreams.  Wish Bear tells them that wishes are not an effective solution any more, and everyone works together to make their home beautiful again ("It Takes You and Me"). At the end, Me Bear, Messy Bear, and Too Loud Bear, having seen the error of their ways, apologize and ask if they can still live in Care-a-lot. The rest of the bears agree and decide to go on a road trip.

 The story begins in the 1960s with three inmates in a [[New York (state)|New York]] prison &mdash; Earl (Van Peebles), Rocco (Kelly), and Carlito (Hernandez) &mdash; controlling their criminal empire within their cell. Upon their release, they all look to control the drug trade in [[Harlem]], which is currently in a power dispute between the Italian Bottolota crime family and black gangsters led by Hollywood Nicky (Combs).

Flattery, bribery, and a keen insight into the human condition facilitate Capote's visits to the prison where the accused are held.  Capote begins to form an attachment to Smith. He informs Shawn of his intent to expand the story into a full-length book. Following the trial and conviction, Capote gains continued access to the murderers by bribing Warden Marshall Krutch ([[Marshall Bell]]).  Capote spends the following years regularly visiting Smith and learning about his life, excepting a year-long stint when he goes to Morocco and Spain to write the "first three parts" of the book, accompanied by his romantic partner [[Jack Dunphy]] ([[Bruce Greenwood]]).  The story of Smith's life, his remorseful manner, and his emotional sincerity impress Capote, who becomes emotionally attached to him despite the gruesome murders. Capote aids Smith and Hickock by obtaining expert legal counsel for them and initiating an appeal. Still he is frustrated, as Smith declines to relate exactly what happened on the night of the murders.  Though initially an effort to provide proper representation and extend Capote's opportunity to speak with the killers, the appeals process drags on for several years. Without the court case being resolved, Capote feels he is stuck with a story without an ending, and he is unable to complete his book. Eventually he gets Smith to describe the killings and his thoughts at the time in great detail. He has what he wants from Smith, but in the process he sees a callousness and selfishness in his own actions.  Now with everything in hand, Capote still must wait for the appeals process to conclude before he feels he can publish his work. In the course of time, Lee's best-selling novel ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' is turned into a movie, but Capote is unable to share in the joy of his friend's success, too caught up in drinking through his own misery.  With the last appeal rejected, Smith pleads for Capote to return before he is executed, but Capote cannot bring himself to do so. A telegram from Smith to Harper Lee ultimately compels Capote to return to Kansas. There he is an eyewitness as Smith and Hickock are executed.  Capote talks to Lee about the horrifying experience and laments that he could not do anything to stop it. She replies, "Maybe not. The fact is you didn't want to." The final scenes show Capote looking through photos from the case and at the writings and drawings given to him by Smith. An epilogue points out that ''In Cold Blood'' turned Capote into the most famous writer in America, also noting that he never finished another book. A postscript to the film gives the [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] he would have chosen for the title of ''[[Answered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel|Answered Prayers]]'': "More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones",<ref>|page=[https://books.google.com/?id=mykSDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT83&dq=%22A+postscript+to+the+film%22%22gives+the+epitaph+he+wrote+for+his+last,+unfinished+work%22%22More+tears+are+shed+over+answered+prayers+than+unanswered+ones%22 77]}}</ref> a quote from [[Teresa of Ãvila|Saint Teresa of Ãvila]].<ref>}}</ref><ref>}}</ref>

The Cave (film)
  The film begins deep in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] of [[Romania]] during the [[Cold War]], where a group of Soviet and British explorers are searching for a long-lost 13th-century [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[abbey]]. As they venture inside and below the church, they make a startling discovery: the abbey is built over the entrance to a vast subterranean [[cave]] system. When they try to blast their way in, they cause a landslide that buries the abbey and the men are trapped in the cave below it. Once they recover, they continue on into the cave without a choice in hopes of finding a way out, but as they do, they hear strange sounds coming from the darkness.  Thirty years later, a team of archeologists are excavating the ruins of the same abbey, where they unearth images of a medieval battle between the [[Knights Templar]] and winged demons, and discover the cave system with its massive underground river. The team is led by Dr. Nicolai ([[Marcel IureÅ]]) and his associate Katheryn Jannings ([[Lena Headey]]), along with her [[Camera operator|cameraman]] Alex Kim ([[Daniel Dae Kim]]). Local [[biologist]]s believe that the cave could contain an undiscovered [[ecosystem]], so they hire a group of American [[Caving#Naming issues|spelunkers]] led by Jack McAllister ([[Cole Hauser]]) and his brother Tyler ([[Eddie Cibrian]]) to help them investigate its unknown depths. Jack and Tyler are [[:wikt:thrill-seeker|thrill-seeking]] professional cave explorers who run a world-famous team of [[Scuba diving|divers]]. They arrive in Romania with the latest equipment, including a modified [[rebreather]] system allowing a diver to remain submerged for up to 24 hours. The diving team includes rock-climbing professional Charlie ([[Piper Perabo]]), first scout Briggs ([[Rick Ravanello]]), [[sonar]] expert Strode ([[Kieran Darcy-Smith]]) and survival expert Top Buchanan ([[Morris Chestnut]]).  As they begin the expedition, Briggs is sent to scout and when contact is lost they decide to press on in the likelihood that it's simply an equipment malfunction. After the group finds him safely downriver, Strode is suddenly attacked and dragged away by a large, unknown creature. His water scooter explodes and causes a cave-in, forcing them to follow the river and search for a new way out. Katheryn and Nicolai discover a strange [[parasite]] in all of the lifeforms they find. Unlike all the known cave species which have simply adapted over the generations to life underground, Katheryn believes this new parasite originated in the cave environment and has never been exposed to the outside world. As they progress the team occasionally stumble across scattered equipment and remains of previous explorers and are unaware they are being stalked by the creatures.  They descend through a series of rapids, where Nicolai is attacked and Jack goes after him. Nicolai is dragged into a crevice but Jack breaks free, injured, after seeing letters clearly tattooed on one of the creatures. Jack also begins to exhibit a transformation of his senses, and physical features. When Jack tells them they must go up again to get out, Charlie scales the wall and is attacked by a creature hidden in the passage above. She nearly drops to her death, but recovers, before the man-size winged creature guts her and kills her on the cliff face in full view of the team. Jack's transformations are beginning to show with his super-keen senses and inhumanly slanted [[pupils]]. Katheryn speculates that Jack, the previous explorers, and all the rest of creatures mutated because of the parasite. In the case of humans, they resemble demons. As they see Jack changing they suspect his motives and his judgement and the team splits up. Alex, Briggs, and Katheryn decide to go their own way but Top and Tyler stay with Jack.  Jack, Top and Tyler discover a cavern littered with human skeletons and realize that this is the ancient battleground depicted in the abbey above, which sealed the cave to prevent the creatures from escaping. After they see daylight through the underwater passage ahead, Tyler goes back to find the others, but Briggs dies defending Katheryn and Alex, while the creatures enter the cavern and steal the rebreathers necessary to navigate the passage. Alex is killed before they can get in the water, but Tyler, Katheryn and Top escape while Jack stays behind to hold off the creatures.  The three survivors return to civilization, and Top goes his own way. Tyler asks Katheryn if Jack could have survived out in the open. She is quiet a moment then says she had thought that the parasite could only survive underground, but now she is uncertain and thinks that it wants to get out. She bends down to kiss him, looking over the rim of her sunglasses revealing pupils like Jack's as she has begun to mutate. As Katheryn suddenly gets up and walks away, Tyler realizes that Katheryn knows she is infected with the parasite and intends to remain free, able to infect others. He runs after her frantically, but she disappears in the crowd.  
Casanova (2005 film)
 A young woman ([[Helen McCrory]]) tearfully leaves her son ([[Eugene Simon]]) to live with his grandmother and promises to return for him someday. Several years later, in 1753, in [[Venice]], Casanova ([[Heath Ledger]]), is notorious for his [[promiscuity]] with women, his adventures being represented in [[puppet theatre]]s around the city. The [[Doge of Venice|Doge]], ([[Tim McInnerny]]) the ruler of the city, is a friend to Casanova, but cannot be too lenient on him as he wishes to avoid trouble with the Church. He warns Casanova to marry soon, or he will be [[exile]]d from the city. Casanova gets engaged to Victoria, famous for her virginity, to save himself from exile.   Casanova later meets and falls in love with Francesca Bruni ([[Sienna Miller]]), who writes illegal [[feminist]] books under the pseudonym of a man, Bernardo Guardi, and also argues for [[women's rights]] as Dr. Giordano de Padua. Francesca mistakes Casanova's name for Lupo Salvato (Casanova's servant) and Casanova humors her, since she hates the ill-reputed Casanova. Francesca and her mother are heavily in debt, however, so her mother ([[Lena Olin]]) pressures her to marry rich Paprizzio ([[Oliver Platt]]), from [[Genoa]], a union arranged by her late father. When Paprizzio arrives in Venice, Casanova lies to him and says that the hotel he booked is closed and he persuades him to stay at his house. Casanova also lies and says that he is indeed Bernardo Guardi. While Paprizzio asks his advice on how to impress Francesca, Casanova lures him to stay at home while receiving treatment for weight loss. Casanova visits Francesca, pretending to be Paprizzio and tells her that he lied to her before to make sure she is not in love with someone else and marrying him only for his money. Francesca initially distrusts him but starts gradually to trust him.  [[Image:Francesco Guardi 044.jpg|thumb|left|''Piazza San Marco'', [[Francesco Guardi]], 18th century.]] During the [[Venetian Carnival]], Francesca recognizes the real Paprizzio from his publicity posters which force Casanova to confess his true identity making her angry. Casanova is arrested by the Venetian Inquisition for crimes against sexual morality, such as [[:wikt:debauchery|debauchery]], [[heresy]], and fornication with a [[novice]]. He saves Francesca by pretending to be Bernardo Guardi, which cools her anger. At his trial, Francesca confesses that she is the real Bernardo Guardi, and both are sentenced to death. Meanwhile, Francesca's mother and the real Paprizzio fall in love.   Just as Casanova and Francesca are about to be hanged in the [[Piazza San Marco]], they are saved by an announcement that the Pope gave amnesty to all prisoners who were to be executed on that day, as it was the Pope's birthday. It is later discovered that the "Cardinal" who gave the announcement was actually an impostor who happens to be Casanova's stepfather, wedded to his long-lost mother who came back for him just as she promised when Casanova was a child.   As they all escape on Paprizzio's boat, Francesca's brother, Giovanni ([[Charlie Cox]]), stays behind to marry Victoria and to continue Casanova's legendary womanizing. The real Casanova spends the rest of his life as a stage actor touring with his family and the Paprizzios.  
The Cave of the Yellow Dog
 The story opens with Nansal returning from [[boarding school]] to her family. The family of five lives in a [[yurt]] and lives off of their livestock, which include sheep, goats, and cattle. Nansal's father is worried about his family's survival because of the wolves that have been attacking their herd.  While Nansal is out collecting dung, she stumbles across a cave in which she finds a black and white dog. She brings the dog home and names it "Zochor" (Spot). Her father is worried, knowing that wolves live in caves and may follow its scent and kill their livestock.  The father departs for town on his [[motorbike]], to sell the [[Fur|pelt]]s of the sheep killed by wolves.  He instructs his wife to get rid of the dog before he is home. Nansal is sent out to graze the herd, but she is distracted and gets lost. The mother is distraught when the herd comes back without Nansal and goes out looking for her.  Meanwhile, Nansal finds refuge in the yurt of an elderly woman. The old lady feeds Nansal and gives her shelter while a storm passes. It is here that Nansal hears the story of the Cave of the Yellow Dog. In this story, a yellow dog is trapped in a cave with no exit by a man to cure his daughter's illness.  The mother finds Nansal soon after and takes her home. Zochor is still with the family when the father returns home. He is angry but still gives gifts to his wife and children nonetheless, including a plastic ladle and a [[flashlight]] (torch). The father tries to sell Zochor to some wolf hunters, but Nansal tells them she found him in a cave and the deal falls through.  It is time for the family to move on. They pack up all of their belongings and the yurt and load them onto carts to be pulled by their cattle. The three children are put onto the wagons, with Nansal watching her younger brother. Zochor is tied to a stake so he cannot follow them. Nansal is distracted by Zochor and does not watch her brother. Her brother escapes.  The family travels several miles until they realize that their son is not with them. The father turns back immediately and rushes back on his horse. Meanwhile, their son is rushing towards a flock of [[vulture]]s. He ventures near a stream, while moving further and further from Zochor. When the son is right next to the flock, Zochor breaks free and scares them away.  This is witnessed by the father who, in gratitude for protecting his son from harm, accepts Zochor into the family.  In the final scene, the family's wagons travel down the road, with Zochor in the wagon with Nansal and a truck driving down the road blaring reminders to vote in the upcoming elections.

After meeting the same man again in the middle of eye exam, Julieta and Romeu quickly become a couple.  However, in order to avoid incurring the wrath of her parents, Romeu is forced to pretend to be an adoring Palmeiras fan, an increasingly difficult task for the die-hard Corinthiano.  Finally, Romeu is forced to admit his true allegiance to Julieta's father on a turbulent plane flight following the Palmeiras' disastrous defeat in an international match in [[Tokyo]] (the [[1999 Intercontinental Cup]]).  Romeu and Julieta are shunned by both members of their family, including Romeu's spry grandmother. Eventually the two families face off in a heated confrontation outside Romeu's apartment, an argument that is escalated particularly after it is revealed that Julieta is pregnant.

Chandramukhi
 Saravanan, a psychiatrist, visits India on vacation. He meets up with his foster brother Senthilnathan alias Senthil, and his wife Ganga. Senthil's mother Kasthuri wanted Senthil to marry Priya, the daughter of his father's cousin Kandaswamy, to reunite the two branches of the family after 30 years of separation because Senthil's father chose to marry Kasthuri instead of Kandaswamy's sister, Akhilandeshwari. Saravanan learns that Senthil had bought the Vettaiyapuram mansion, despite attempts by the local village elders to dissuade them, and moves in with them. Akhilandeshwari is jealous of Saravanan and plots to kill him with the help of her assistant Oomaiyan.  When the family visits their ancestral temple, the chief priest reveals the reason everyone fears the Vettaiyapuram mansion. A hundred-and-fifty years ago, a king named Vettaiyan travelled to [[Vizianagaram district|Vijayanagaram]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]], where he met and fell in love with a dancer named Chandramukhi. However, she did not reciprocate his feelings as she was already in love with a dancer named Gunashekaran. As a result, Vettaiyan took her back to his palace by force. Unknown to him, Chandramukhi made Gunashekaran stay in a house nearby and had meetings with him secretly. When Vettaiyan discovered this, he beheaded Gunashekaran on [[Durga Puja|Durgashtami]] and burnt Chandramukhi alive. As a result, Chandramukhi's ghost tried to take revenge on Vettaiyan, who with the help of various priests and sorcerers from all over the country, tames the ghost by locking it up in a room located in the palace's south-west corner. Priya is in love with Vishwanathan, a dance professor who reciprocates her feelings. Their love is supported by Saravanan, who requests Kandaswamy to arrange their marriage.  After hearing Chandramukhi's story, Ganga, who thinks that the story was fabricated to scare thieves from stealing treasures in the room, wishes to go there. She gets the room key from the gardener's granddaughter Durga and opens the door to the room. Saravanan sees a conversation between Durga and Ganga, and runs away, thinking that Durga is possessed, because a flash of light appeared when both of them were speaking. Subsequently, strange things begin to happen in the household; a ghost frightens the people in the house, things inexplicably break, and Ganga's ''[[sari]]'' catches fire. Suspicion turns towards Durga. Senthil immediately calls Saravanan to solve the case. As soon as Saravanan returns, a mysterious being tries to kill Priya. Attempts to kill Senthil are made with poisoning his coffee and by pushing a fish tank on top of him. A mysterious voice sings during the night. Saravanan investigates these incidents.  Ganga mysteriously disappears during Priya and Viswanathan's wedding reception. Saravanan notices her absence and searches for her, but he is almost killed by Oomaiyanwho has been sent by Akhilandeshwari. Saravanan subdues Oomaiyan and with Senthil's help finds Ganga, who is supposedly being sexually harassed by Viswanathan. Saravanan reveals to Senthil and Viswanathan that Ganga suffers from [[Dissociative identity disorder|split personality disorder]]. Saravanan explains to them how she became affected by it and how she took up Chandramukhi's identity. He tells them Ganga tried to kill Priya and Senthil, and framed Viswanathan for sexual harassment because from Chandramukhi's view, Viswanathan is her lover Gunashekaran since he stays at the same place Gunashekaran did. By framing Vishwanathan, Chandramukhi wanted to stop the reception. The only way to stop Chandramukhi is to make her believe Vettaiyan is dead since Saravanan impersonated Vettaiyan and disrupted one of the [[Puja (Hinduism)|''pujas'']] conducted by the exorcist Ramachandra Acharya by conversing with the ghost to know its wish.  Akhilandeshwari overhears Saravanan's idea of self-sacrifice and apologises to him. Later, in the dance hall, the family and Ramachandra Acharya allow Chandramukhi to burn Saravanan alive. Ramachandra Acharya blows smoke and ash on Ganga's face when she is given a torch to burn Saravanan. Senthil then opens a trapdoor to let Saravanan escape, and an effigy of Vettaiyan gets burnt instead. Convinced that Vettaiyan is dead, Chandramukhi leaves Ganga's body, curing her. The two families are reunited after 30 years; Saravanan and Durga fall in love, and the couple Swarna and Murugesan become parents after eight years of marriage.

Cello (film)
 A young woman playing [[Ave Maria (Schubert)|Schubert's ''Ave Maria'']] on a [[cello]]; the scene switches to another woman bleeding on an operating table.  Hong Mi-ju ([[Sung Hyun-ah]]) is watching students play their cellos while their professor grades them. The professor tries to coax her into going to a concert for the little sister of Kim Tae-yeon. Mi-ju declines both the concert and a job offer to become more than just an associate teacher. Mi-ju is confronted by a student who says that because of Mi-ju, her music is for nothing. The student promises revenge. Shaken, Mi-ju drives home and nearly avoids getting into an accident with a truck. At home, she receives a message on her cell phone: "Are you happy? ...You should be."  In her attic, Mi-ju sees her elder, autistic daughter, Yoon-jin. Her husband Jun-ki, her sister-in-law Kyeong-ran, and her younger daughter Yoon-hye are also present; everyone but Yoon-jin  appears mute and emotionless. Yoon-jin sings "Happy Birthday" to Mi-ju. Mi-ju seems to share a special affection for Yoon-jin. The next day, Yoon-jin stops to stare at a cello in a music store, and Mi-ju buys it for her. Mi-ju meets the new, silent housekeeper, Ji-sook, and begins to teach Yoon-jin how to play the cello. Yoon-hye plays in Kyeong-ran's room until the latter's fiance, Hyeon-woo, shoos her out. Yoon-hye asks Yoon-jin to try the cello, but the normally calm and emotionless Yoon-jin bites her little sister.   The same night, Kyeong-ran has a breakdown, as her fiance has seemingly broken up with her. Mi-ju watches the sleeping Yoon-jin, but her daughter's sleeping face suddenly becomes ghastly. In Kyeon-ran's room, a ghost emerges and throws her through the glass balcony door. The rest of the family does not seem to hear a thing. However, Yoon-jin gets out of bed and sees Kyeong-ran strangled and dangling at her window. Jun-ki presents Mi-ju with her old college yearbook, asking why Kim Tae-yeon's pictures are cut out. Mi-ju tells her husband the reason why she quit playing the cello is because of her former friend, Kim Tae-yeon. The flashback shows a plain girl, Kim Tae-yeon, struggling to play as good as Mi-ju, and pretend to be happy for her as Mi-ju rises above her. The night Mi-ju was chosen above Tae-yeon, there was a car accident and Tae-yeon was killed while Mi-ju was injured.  Mi-ju attends the cello concert she had previously declined. However, she finds herself alone in the room. She sees the same ghost from Kyeong-ran's room on stage, playing the cello, leaving Mi-ju terrified. At home, Yoon-hye becomes frightened when the cello starts to appear and disappear without anyone touching it. Mi-ju returns to see Yoon-jin causing Yoon-hye to fall to her death from the balcony. Mi-ju places her body in the basement and lies to Jun-ki that Yoon-hye went to camp. Jun-ki calls Yoon-hye and hears the ringing in the basement. Confronting his wife, he accuses Mi-ju of killing their daughter. In the struggle, Mi-ju pushes her husband back, only to find he has been stabbed by a sharp pipe and is dead. Mi-ju turns to face the stairway slowly and sees the ghost who looks like the disgruntled student and whispers, "...Kim Tae-yeon..."   Through the ghost of Kim Tae-yeon's eyes, we see a flashback of what really happened. Tae-yeon, who looks exactly like the student from the beginning of the movie; pretty, talented, and confident (indeed, the audience is led to believe there really wasn't a student to begin with, but rather Mi-ju hallucinating events), is the more talented cello player. It is Tae-yeon, not Mi-ju, who was the more talented, sweet, and "better" student. After the final humiliation of Tae-yeon being chosen over her, Mi-ju swerves while driving them home and crashes the car by a steep incline off the road. Tae-yeon is thrown from the car and is barely holding on from falling off the side of the cliff. Mi-ju grabs her friend's hand but eventually lets Tae-yeon fall to her death.  Brought back to the present, Mi-ju tries to stab Tae-yeon's ghost with a knife to stop her from going to Yoon-jin, begging "Not my Yoon-jin, not my Yoon-jin!". She then sees that she has stabbed the housekeeper. Believing the cello holds the power to the ghost of Tae-yeon, Mi-ju grabs a golf club and rushes to Yoon-jin's room. Mi-ju grabs the cello, throws it out against the wall, and smashes it as Yoon-jin screams in her room. When the noise stops, Mi-ju goes in. The room is empty except for the cello, which is unharmed. She looks back into the hallway to see the beaten and bloody body of her daughter. As Mi-ju kneels by the weltering Yoon-jin, she feels Tae-yeon forcing her hand to stab Yoon-jin's beaten body. Mi-ju resists and stabs herself in the chest.  Mi-ju wakes up in the hospital to find that her earlier car accident was not imaginary, and that the previous events have been part of her comaâthe voices she heard were actually those of Jun-ki and Yoon-hye, whispering for her to wake up. Mi-ju finds her family members are all safe and sound, around her and hugging her tightly. Outside the hospital room, Jun-ki asks the doctor why his wife thought they were all dead. The doctor replies it was probably part of the comaâMi-ju's family is all that is important to Mi-ju now, and often anxiety will pertain to what is most important to a person.   When Mi-ju returns home, she receives the same message again: "Are you happy? ...You should be." She walks through the house turning on lights, which go out when she reaches the attic. Again, she finds her family there, in the same way as she did in the beginning of the movie. They sing "Happy Birthday" to her, and Kyeong-ran gives Mi-ju the same album. Inside, she finds a scribbled inscription: "This is only the beginning," before the ghostly hands of Kim Tae-yeon reach through Mi-ju's hair and slowly grasp her old friend's face.<ref>[http://www.fangoria.com/reviews/3-dvd-a-blu-ray/4557-cello-dvd-review CELLO (DVD REVIEW)]</ref>

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)
  [[Charlie Bucket]] ([[Freddie Highmore]]) is a poor boy who lives near the Wonka Candy Company. The company's owner, [[Willy Wonka]] ([[Johnny Depp]]), has for long closed access to his factory due to problems concerning [[industrial espionage]] that led him to fire all his employees, among them Charlie's [[Grandpa Joe]] ([[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]]). One day, Wonka announces a contest, in which Golden Tickets have been placed in five random [[Wonka Bar]]s worldwide, and the winners will be given a full tour of the factory as well as a lifetime supply of chocolate, while one ticketholder will be given a special prize at the end of the tour.   Wonka's sales subsequently skyrocket, and the first four tickets are found fairly quickly. The recipients are [[Augustus Gloop]] ([[Philip Wiegratz]]), a gluttonous German boy; [[Veruca Salt]] ([[Julia Winter]]), a very spoiled English girl; [[Violet Beauregarde]] ([[AnnaSophia Robb]]), a competitive gum chewer, and [[Mike Teavee]] ([[Jordan Fry]]), an arrogant television and video game addict. Charlie tries twice to find a ticket, but both bars come up empty. After overhearing that the final ticket was found in [[Russia]], Charlie finds a ten-dollar note, and purchases a Wonka Bar at a news shop. At the exact moment it was revealed that the Russian ticket was forged, Charlie discovers the real fifth ticket inside the wrapper. Charlie first considers an offer of $500 for the ticket, but decides to keep it, and bring Grandpa Joe to accompany him on the factory tour.  Charlie and the other ticket holders are greeted by Wonka outside the factory, who then leads them into the facility. During the tour, each of the bad children disobey Wonka's orders after being tempted by something related to their individual character flaws, and suffer various consequences: Augustus is sucked up a chocolate extraction pipe after falling into a chocolate river from which he was drinking, Violet is turned into an oversized blueberry after chewing unstable three-course-meal gum, Veruca is pushed into a garbage chute by worker squirrels after she tries to take one as a pet, and Mike is shrunk with a teleporter that he uses on himself. Wonka's employees, the [[Oompa-Loompa]]s ([[Deep Roy]]) sing a song of morality after each elimination. The children later leave the factory with an exaggerated characteristic or deformity related to their demise &ndash; Augustus covered in chocolate, Violet flexible and violet-colored, Mike overstretched and Veruca merely covered in garbage. In addition, Augustusâs mother realises her sonâs addiction to candy is bad and Verucaâs father resolves to stop spoiling his daughter.  Wonka then invites Charlie to come live and work in the factory with him, and reveals that the purpose of the Golden Tickets and the tour was to make the "least rotten" child the heir of the factory itself. The only catch is that Charlie must leave his family behind, because Wonka believes family is a hindrance while a chocolatier needed creative freedom &ndash; a philosophy Wonka developed due to his dentist father, Dr. Wilbur Wonka ([[Christopher Lee]]), denying his son candy because of the potential risk to his teeth. After sneaking over a piece of candy, Wonka was instantly hooked, and ran away to follow his dreams. When he returned, both his father and their house were gone.  As his family is the most important thing in his life, Charlie refuses Wonka's offer. Charlie and his family are living contently a while later, however Wonka is too depressed to make candy the way he used to, causing his candy to sell poorly and his company to decline. He turns to Charlie for advice.

In the end, Wonka finally allows Charlieâs family to move into the factory, Charlie has the chocolate factory, and Wonka has patched up with his family.

Tom's old rival Jimmy Murtaugh and his large family (with "only" eight kids) are also there for the summer. Jimmy constantly flaunts his wealth and success to Tom, as well as the accomplishments of his children, often suggesting to Tom that the Baker children are less successful because of Tom's parenting style. The Baker kids get into many incidents, several of which are accidental: Mark Baker, along with Kenny Murtaugh, crashes into a tennis court with a golf cart; Sarah Baker is caught shoplifting in a gift shop, and Mark accidentally sets off a backpack of fireworks, causing widespread panic, especially when the backpack is thrown into a boat, igniting its engine and causing it to explode.

Chaos (2005 Dominion film)
 While living at her parents' mountain home, Emily (Degroat) is visited by her friend Angelica (Barovich), who invites her to a [[rave]] party in the woods. Her interracial parents, Leo (Richards) and Justine ([[Deborah Lacey|Lacey]]), let her attend, under the condition that she must return by midnight and call if she's going to be late.  Arriving early at the party, Angelica immediately attempts to acquire [[MDMA|ecstasy]] and suspects an attendee named Swan ([[Sage Stallone|Stallone]]) is carrying the drug. When asked about it, Swan informs the two girls that he doesn't have any ecstasy on him, but he has it in a nearby cabin, where his friends live. He invites Emily and Angelica to come to the cabin with him and meet his friends; the two agree. Unknown to the girls, Swan's friends are actually his father Chaos (Gage), a notorious and wanted criminal, and his father's gang, which consists of Chaos' girlfriend Daisy (Quann) and felon Frankie (Wozniak). Chaos had sent his son to the party in order to lure unsuspecting women.  Upon their arrival at the cabin, Emily and Angelica are quickly captured by the gang and taken to an abandoned part of the woods. The girls manage to escape from their captors and split up in an attempt to make it harder for Chaos and his gang to find them. Angelica is ultimately caught by Daisy and brought before Chaos, who cuts off one of her nipples and force-feeds it to her, making her vomit, before he stabs her to death, and then proceeds to [[Necrophilia|violate her corpse]]. Chaos and his group continue their pursuit of Emily, even as the sun sets. They briefly re-encounter her, but Emily manages to steal Daisy's knife in a struggle and stabs Swan in the genitals. Knowing his wound is fatal, Chaos suffocates his son and promises to murder Emily.  Meanwhile, Justine becomes nervous about Emily's whereabouts when she doesn't answer her phone and convinces Leo to call the police. However, Justine suspects that MacDunner (Medlock), the investigating officer, won't attempt to find her because he's a racist who can barely contain his contempt for them. Justine and Leo head into the woods to search for Angelica and Emily by themselves. While searching for Emily, the couple find Angelica's corpse. Chaos and Frankie finally recapture Emily and bind her with rope. In retaliation for his son's death, Chaos uses his knife to slash Emily between her anus and genitals, watching as she bleeds to death and lamenting that he left her in no condition to be raped like he did Angelica. With both girls dead, the gang prepares to leave the area, but Chaos' van fails to start up. Knowing that they'll be caught if they stay in the woods, Chaos and his gang leave the vehicle and look for a car to steal. Their van is then found by MacDunner and his partner Wilson (Barrows), who discover blood-stained clothes.  The gang decides to go to a nearby house, with the intent of stealing the owner's car, unaware that they have arrived at Emily's home. Leo lets Chaos and his group stay at the home, but notices that Daisy is wearing Emily's belt. Suspecting the group of being involved with Emily's disappearance, Leo calls the police, while Chaos and Frankie prepare to hot-wire his car and kill the couple.   Chaos is confronted by a shotgun-wielding Leo, determined to find out what happened to his daughter. When Frankie arrives with a captured Justine, Chaos disarms Leo and takes the shotgun. Instead of shooting Leo and Justine, however, Chaos shoots Daisy when she tries to convince him to leave the house. In the ensuing confusion, the couple escape. Leo emerges with a chainsaw and slashes Frankie across the stomach, and proceeds to attack Chaos. In the ensuing struggle, Leo manages to get the shotgun back from Chaos and prepares to kill him. Before he can, MacDunner arrives and stupidly orders Leo to drop his weapon, and then shoots and kills Leo when he aims the shotgun at Chaos. Justine retaliates by shooting MacDunner in the back and Wilson is killed by Chaos, who then whirls around and shoots Justine in the stomach, paralyzing her. Chaos then walks up to a gasping, terrified Justine and shoots her in the head, as his laughter is heard over the closing credits.

Chaos (2005 Capitol film)
 [[Seattle Police Department|Seattle PD]] Detective Quentin Conners ([[Jason Statham]]) and his partner Jason York are implicated in the death of a hostage taken by a [[carjacker]] named John Curtis. After a fellow police officer, Callo ([[John Cassini]]), testifies against them, Conners is suspended, and York is fired. In reality, York tried to shoot John, but accidentally killed the hostage. John in turn fired back, but Conners killed John in self-defense.  Some time later, Lorenz ([[Wesley Snipes]]) and four other criminals take hostages in a bank. Lorenz has only one demand, to negotiate with Conners. Conners is reinstated but put under the surveillance of a new partner, the recently-graduated Shane Dekker ([[Ryan Phillippe]]). Conners is given control of the negotiations, and after a bank teller is shot, he orders a [[SWAT]] unit to cut the building's power and go in. During an explosion, the criminals flee during the ensuing panic and chaos.  Dekker and Conners learn more about each other at a local diner, slowly building a friendship, but Dekker disapproves of Conners' "cowboy cop" methods. Dekker explains that during negotiations, Lorenz was making many cryptic references to [[chaos theory]]. As they leave to examine new evidence, Conners pays with a ten dollar bill and says he does not like to tip. Dekker swaps the ten for a twenty of his own. A TV camera caught a shot of one of the criminals, who is arrested together with his girlfriend at her home, where banknotes are found with a scent used to mark evidence collected by the police. The banknote serial numbers did not come from that day's robbery, but had been placed in police storage and signed out two weeks earlier by Callo. He is found shot dead in his home, together with incriminating evidence linking him to the heist.  When reviewing video footage from the bank, Dekker notices one corner of the bank is deliberately shielded from view. In that corner, they find the bank regional manager's computer. Fingerprints on the keyboard reveal the identity of a hacker that Conners himself had arrested, but whose conviction was overturned after the shooting on the bridge. Conners and Dekker want to question the hacker, but he is shot dead by Lorenz, and a gunfight ensues, during which Lorenz manages to escape. Dekker questions the hospitalized bank robber identified in the news footage and finally breaks him when he casually explains the impact of a massive overdose of morphine while slowly injecting something into the suspect's drip. An amazed Conners watches and later calls him a hypocrite. Dekker responds by explaining he only injected more saline solution.  The suspect reveals Lorenz is Scott Curtis, the brother of John shot earlier, and Conners leads a stakeout at an address where all the gang are to meet that night; Scott's house. Forced to go before Scott arrives, a shootout results in both suspects' deaths, and a bomb blows up the building while Conners is inside. Dekker is devastated but realizes that Callo's signature requesting material from the evidence storage was forged by the evidence custody officer, who reveals that Scott is actually York. In a flashback, York stands on the bridge and fires the first shot, killing the hostage in the opening sequence. Tracking Lorenz/York's mobile phone, Dekker surprises York at a diner, and York takes a woman hostage in a reversal of the standoff on the bridge. Dekker chases and eventually kills York.  When Dekker pays for his coffee at the diner, he discovers the banknote Conners used to pay for lunch with is also scented, which means Conners was also involved in taking the money from police evidence. Dekker finds a copy of [[James Gleick]]'s ''[[Chaos: Making a New Science]]'' in Conners' house, showing he had faked an earlier ignorance of the mathematics. On a hunch, Dekker looks for airplane tickets booked in Gleick's name and runs to the airport.  During a mobile call between the now disguised Conners and the searching Dekker at the busy airport, flashbacks reveal how the seemingly unconnected events in the film form a pattern, just as predicted in chaos theory. Conners reveals that he placed his badge on Scott's corpse before the explosion. Conners and York recruited a group of ex-convicts from their past. Callo was framed for being a dirty cop. Conners ends the call, walks casually to a private jet, and takes off while sipping champagne.

Chicken Little says that a piece of the sky shaped like a stop sign had fallen on his head, but he is unable to find the piece. His father, Buck Cluck, assumes that this "piece of sky" was just an acorn that had fallen from the tree, making Chicken Little the laughingstock of the town.  A year later, Chicken Little remains ostracized and unhappy. Trying to help, his friend Abby Mallard encourages Chicken Little to talk to his father, but he really only wants to make his dad proud of him. As a result, he joins his school's baseball team in an attempt to recover his reputation and his father's pride, but is benched until the ninth inning of the last game, when he miraculously makes a home run and is hailed as a hero for winning the pennant.  Later that night, he is hit on the head by the same "piece of the sky" â only to find out that it is not really a piece of the sky, but rather a device that blends into its surroundings. He calls his friends over to help figure out what the device is. When one of them pushes a button on the back of the hexagon, it flies into the sky and turns out to be part of the camouflage of an invisible UFO.  Chicken Little manages to ring the bell to warn everyone, but the aliens see the crowds coming and escape, accidentally leaving behind a small orange alien. The town does not believe the story of the alien invasion and thinks it is a repeat of the acorn incident, and Chicken Little is ridiculed yet again. He and his friends discover the orange alien, and a few minutes later a whole fleet of alien ships descends on the town and start what appears to be an invasion. As the aliens rampage throughout Oakey Oaks, vaporizing everything in their path, Little realizes he must return the alien to its parents to save the planet. First, though, he confronts his father and regains his trust.  In the invasion, Buck defends Little from the aliens until they are vaporized. It is then discovered that the aliens were not vaporizing people, but the ray guns teleported them aboard the UFO. The invasion was a misunderstanding, as the two aliens were looking for their lost child and attacked only out of concern. Little returns the child, and the aliens return everything to normal; as they depart they note a loose tile on their ship. Everyone is grateful for Chicken Little's efforts to save the town.

 The movie starts with the [[Chousei Kantai Sazer-X#Characters|Sazer-X]] playing basketball. All of a sudden a flash of lightning strikes the earth. They headed for it, and discovered a boy. The boy was Riki,<ref>A ''boy'' sent by the [[Chousei Kantai Sazer-X#Space Pirate Fleet Descal|space pirates]] who turns out to be the major character of this movie</ref> who pretended to forget everything.  On the other hand, Remy informs the Sazer-X that a giant monster, 'Mecha Giant Beast Bulgario',<ref>A giant monster who appeared in the beginning of the film</ref> had approached the Earth and were destroying buildings. The Sazer-X defeated the monster anyway. But then something flashed into their eyes, Takuto had mistaken it for a Cosmo Capsule. It was, in fact, a [[Chouseishin Gransazer#Bosquito|Bosquito]] existed inside Bulgario, which was later explained by [[Chouseishin Gransazer#Professor Ichiro Horiguchi|Professor Horiguchi]].<ref>[[Chouseishin Gransazer#Professor Ichiro Horiguchi|Professor Horiguchi]] is from [[Chouseishin Gransazer]]</ref>  The Bosquito absorbed the JustiPowers in the Sazer Island, reproduced and disguised themselves into [[Genseishin Justirisers#The Justirisers|Justirisers]]. The boy Riki was sent by the Space Pirates to steal the Cosmo Capsules. Riki was convinced that the Earthlings were Bosquito and were responsible for the elimination of their planet. Vengeance arose in his mind,<ref>Willing to take revenge</ref> so he accepted the proposal made by the Space Pirates.  Later he realizes that humanity was not Bosquito, and the Space Pirates were the one who deceived him in the hope of getting the Cosmo Capsules.  Bosquito commenced to massacre thousands of people by absorbing them. The attires were the only thing left of the people and were all fallen on the ground.<ref>The dresses and everything except the body were fallen on the ground</ref> The real Justirisers couldn't believe this scenario. They tried to transform but was in vain. National Defense made a space battleship â called 'Interception Battleship Gouten' â to invade the Bosquito. They also sent 'Type-05 GS Assist Robot Yuuhi', but it was soon destroyed. The Justirisers went to the Sazer Island and found Mio Tendou lying senseless. All of them helped get back the JustiPowers. Soon Riki breaks G2 and the Sazer-X were incapable of transforming. Takuto was taken by the Space Pirates and was sent to the Phantom Ship where he saves people from other planets (who were destroyed by the Bosquito), including Riki's mother and father.  Takuto's grandfather (Sojirou Ando) repaired G2 but soon Riki steals G2. Riki then realizes the deception of the Space Pirates and so he resolved not to handover the Cosmo Capsules to them. Rather he kept G2 with him, and let the Sazer-X transform again. Professor Horiguchi kept a Crystal Slab, which would react to the only one whose heart is full of love, courage and justice.<ref>A Crystal Slab is like a big stone of white colour, also known as the Willpower Equipment</ref> Luckily that person was Riki, who helped the [[Chouseishin Gransazer#The GranSazers|Gransazers]] to get back their powers. The Justirisers and Gransazers fought against thousands of Bosquito. Then the Sazer-X came for the aid. They combined their powers and destroyed many of the Bosquito. But quickly the Phantom Ship crashed on Earth and absorbed all the powers of the other Bosquito on Earth and formed the Mammoth-Bosquito dragon, which was enormous in size, that even the Chouseishin and all other robots were tiny compared to that.  The Mammoth-Bosquito was destroyed by Great-Lio using the final move, Howling Crush, in which the power of the Gransazers, Justirisers and Sazer-X combined into the finishing attack to destroy the monster.  
Cinderella Man
 James J. Braddock is an [[Irish-American]] [[Boxing|boxer]] from [[New Jersey]], formerly a [[light heavyweight]] contender, who is forced to give up boxing after breaking his hand in the ring. This is both a relief and a burden to his wife, Mae. She cannot bring herself to watch the violence of his chosen profession, yet she knows they will not have enough income without his boxing.  As the United States enters the [[Great Depression]], Braddock does [[manual labor]] as a [[longshoreman]] to support his family, even with his injured hand. Unfortunately, he cannot get work every day. Thanks to a last-minute cancellation by another boxer, Braddock's longtime manager and friend, [[Joe Gould (boxing)|Joe Gould]], offers him a chance to fill in for just one night and earn cash. The fight is against the number-two contender in the world, [[Corn Griffin]].  Braddock stuns the boxing experts and fans with a third-round knockout of his formidable opponent. He believes that while his right hand was broken, he became more proficient with his left hand, improving his in-ring ability. Despite Mae's objections, Braddock takes up Gould's offer to return to the ring. Mae resents this attempt by Gould to profit from her husband's dangerous livelihood, until she discovers that Gould and his wife also have been devastated by hard times.  With a shot at the heavyweight championship held by [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]] a possibility, Braddock continues to win. Out of a sense of pride, he uses a portion of his prize money to pay back money to the government given to him while unemployed. When his [[rags to riches]] story gets out, the sportswriter [[Damon Runyon]] dubs him "The Cinderella Man", and before long Braddock comes to represent the hopes and aspirations of the American public struggling with the Depression.  A title fight against Baer comes his way. Braddock is a 10-to-1 [[underdog (competition)|underdog]]. Mae is terrified because Baer, the champ, is a vicious man who reportedly has killed at least two men in the ring. He is so destructive that the fight's promoter, James Johnston, forces both Braddock and Gould to watch a film of Baer in action, just so he can maintain later that he warned them what Braddock was up against.  Braddock demonstrates no fear. The arrogant Baer attempts to intimidate him, even taunting Mae in public that her man might not survive. When he says this, she becomes so angry that she throws a drink at him. She is unable to attend the fight at the [[Madison Square Garden Bowl]] or even to listen to it on the radio.  On June 13, 1935, in one of the greatest upsets in boxing history, Braddock defeats the seemingly invincible Baer to become the heavyweight champion of the world.  An epilogue reveals that Braddock would lose his title to [[Joe Louis]] and later worked on the building of the [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge|Verrazano Bridge]], owning and operating heavy machinery on the docks where he worked during the Depression, and that he and Mae used his boxing income to buy a house, where they spent the rest of their lives.  
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
  During World War II, the Pevensie children, [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]], [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]], [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] and [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]], are evacuated from a London suburb to Professor [[Digory Kirke]]'s country home. [[Mrs Macready]], the strict housekeeper, explains he is unaccustomed to hosting children.  While the Pevensies play hide-and-seek, Lucy discovers a wardrobe and enters the [[fantasy world]] called [[Narnia]]. Seeing a lamppost, Lucy encounters the [[faun]] [[Mr. Tumnus]], who invites her to his home. He puts Lucy to sleep by playing a lullaby on his flute. When Lucy wakes up, she finds Tumnus grieving. He explains that Jadis, the [[White Witch]], has cursed Narnia to a hundred years of winter. If a human is encountered, they are to be brought to her. Tumnus cannot bring himself to kidnap Lucy, so he sends her home. When she returns to Professor Kirke's house, hardly any time has passed, and her siblings disbelieve her story.  One night, Edmund follows Lucy into the wardrobe, entering Narnia. While searching for Lucy, he meets the White Witch, who claims to be queen. She offers him [[Turkish Delight]] and the prospect of becoming king if he brings his siblings to her castle. After she departs, Edmund and Lucy meet again and return. Lucy tells Peter and Susan what happened, but Edmund lies. Professor Kirke suggests she is telling the truth, though they remain unconvinced.  While running away from Mrs. Macready after accidentally breaking a window, the four siblings retreat to the wardrobe and enter Narnia. They discover the Witch has taken Mr. Tumnus, and they meet Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who tell them about [[Aslan]]. According to the beavers, Aslan intends to take control of Narnia from the Witch. The four must help Aslan; it has been prophesied that if two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve sit in the four thrones, the White Witch's reign will end.  Edmund sneaks off to visit the Witch. When he arrives at her castle, she is furious he has not delivered his siblings. The Witch sends wolves to track down the children and the beavers, who barely escape. Edmund is chained in the Witch's dungeon, where he meets Tumnus. The Witch demands Edmund reveal his siblings' location. After Tumnus claims that Edmund knows nothing, The Witch tells Mr. Tumnus Edmund betrayed him, then turns Tumnus to stone.  While Peter, Lucy, Susan, and the beavers travel, they hide from what they believe to be the White Witch. It is really [[Father Christmas]], a sign that the Witch's reign is ending. Father Christmas gives them weapons to defend themselves. Lucy receives a healing [[cordial (medicine)|cordial]] that can heal any injury. Susan receives a magical horn that will summon help and a bow and quiver full of arrows. Peter receives a sword. After evading wolves led by [[Maugrim]], the group reaches Aslan's camp. Aslan is revealed as a huge and noble lion, who promises to help Edmund. Later, two wolves ambush Lucy and Susan. When Peter intervenes, Maugrim attacks him, and Peter kills him. Some of Aslan's troops follow the other wolf to the witch's camp and rescue Edmund. Peter is knighted by Aslan.  The White Witch journeys to Aslan's camp and claims Edmund, but Aslan secretly offers to sacrifice himself instead. That night, as Lucy and Susan covertly watch, the White Witch fatally stabs Aslan. In the morning, he is resurrected, citing magic beyond the Witch's understanding. Aslan takes Susan and Lucy to the Witch's castle, where he frees the prisoners she turned to stone. Edmund persuades Peter to lead Aslan's army. While saving Peter from the Witch, Edmund is mortally wounded. As the Witch fights Peter, Aslan arrives with reinforcements and kills her. After Edmund is revived by Lucy's cordial, the Pevensies are crowned King Peter the Magnificent, Queen Susan the Gentle, King Edmund the Just, and Queen Lucy the Valiant.  Fifteen years later, the Pevensie children, now young adults, chase a white stag through the forest. They encounter the lamppost Lucy saw earlier and suddenly tumble out of the wardrobe at the same time and day they left, becoming children again. Lucy later attempts to return to Narnia via the wardrobe. Professor Kirke tells her he has tried for many years, and they will probably return to Narnia when they least expect it.

After a deadly shootout and a high speed chase on a cat-walk, Sarah is intercepted by another "handler" like Sandrine, who tells her the same story, claiming to be from a different country and a different agency, but still desiring the same unknown element.

Coach Carter
 In 1999, Ken Carter takes over the head coaching job for the basketball team at his former high school [[Richmond High School (Richmond, California)|Richmond]], having played on the team himself and earning records. Carter quickly sees that the athletes are rude and disrespectful, and are in need of discipline. He hands the players individual contracts, instructing them to attend all of their classes, sit in the front row of those classes, wear dress shirts and ties on game days, refer to everyone (players and coach alike) as "sir", and maintain a 2.3 (C+) grade point average, among other requirements. Carter also asks the school staff for progress reports on the players' grades and attendance. He teaches them to play a disciplined brand of basketball.  In the gym, Carter is faced by hostility from the players and one of them, Timo Cruz attempts to punch him but he stops him by putting his arm on his back and pushing him against the wall. Cruz quits the team in anger along with two other players, the previous season top scorers. Carter warns them that, if they are late for practice, then they will run suicides (a type of sprint touching the court's lines), and, if they act disrespectfully towards him, then they will do push-ups.  He then orders them to do a series of suicides for one hour to improve their conditioning. Later, Carter's son, Damien, decides to join the team, after quitting the private school St. Francis. Shocked, Carter asks why he did this, and Damien tells him that he wants to play for his father.  Carter reluctantly agrees but holds his son to a higher set of standards than the rest of the team.  Kenyon Stone struggles to come to terms with his girlfriend, Kyra who is pregnant, unsure if he can juggle basketball and prepare for college as well as be a parent. In their opener against Hercules, Cruz watches the team win and then asks Carter what he has to do to get back on to the team. Carter agrees but on one condition: he needs to do 2,500 push-ups and 1,000 suicides before Friday.  During a practice, Carter tells Cruz to give up because it is impossible to complete all of the push ups and suicides by Friday. When the day arrives, Cruz has not been able to finish but the team help him by doing some of his push-ups and suicides, getting him back on the team. On a game day, Carter asks Cruz what his biggest fear is, and Cruz is confused by the question. Later, the team won the game. Carter learns that one particular student does not attend classes: Junior Battle. Later in practice, Carter talks to Battle, who does not seem to be worried about it, so Carter suspends him for games. After a confrontation, Battle leaves the team in anger. Afterwards, Battle's mother asks Carter to let him back on the team. Carter says that he needs to hear that from Battle himself. Battle apologizes for what he did and is allowed back on the team, but is told that he had to do 1,000 push-ups and 1,000 suicides to make up for it.  At the winter dance, Stone talks to his girlfriend about the baby and says he does not want to live that way. He asks her what she's going to do after the baby is born and believes that she would not know what to do. She angrily tells him that she is having the baby with or without his support.  The team goes on to have an undefeated record, eventually winning the Bay Hill Holiday tournament. The team go off to a party hosted in a girl's house, without the knowledge of her parents. After looking for the players to celebrate, Carter goes to the house and orders his team to leave. In the bus going home, Carter criticizes his team for their reckless behavior, while Cruz points out that they won the tournament and already gave Carter what he wanted: winners. Back at school, Carter discovers that the progress reports show that some of the students have been skipping classes and failing academically. Enraged, Carter locks the gym, and sends his players to the library to study with their teachers. This upsets the players, especially Cruz, who quits the team again, stating that he had tried so hard to do all those push-ups and suicides for Carter, to get back on the team in the first place.  Later, although this priority to good values is praised in the national media, Carter is criticized by parents and academic personnel alike for his decision to lock down the gym. One night, someone throws a brick through Carter's store window for not letting the team play. The next day, a man pulls up next to Carter's car at a stoplight then proceeds to spit on his window, taunting him about his decision to lock down the gym. Carter became enraged and tries to hit him, but Damien breaks up the fight. Later that evening, while Cruz is hanging out with his drug dealer cousin Renny, he saves three of his teammates from being harassed by some gangsters, but when the drug deal goes wrong, his cousin is shot dead, leaving Cruz distraught. Cruz goes to the Carters' house and begs to be allowed back on the team. Carter comforts him and allows it.  The school board eventually confronts Carter, who explains how he wants to give his team the opportunity and option for further education so that they won't turn their lives around into crime, asserting that achieving a sound education is more important for the students than winning basketball games. A man suggests that Carter should be removed from the basketball coach position, which the board does not have the power to decide that, which then leads him to suggest that they should end the lockout. Carter promises that he will quit if the lockout is ended. Principal Garrison and the chairman vote to not end the lockout, but the other board members (four) vote in favor of ending it. Afterwards, Carter is shocked to find his players in the gym with desks and teachers, studying and working to bring their grades back up. The athletes decide to fulfill Carter's original intention of them pursuing academic achievement before continuing to play their next game. Cruz answers Carter's question about fear and thanks him for saving his life. They work hard and eventually raise their grade point average to a point that fulfills their contracts. Later, Stone talks to Kyra about the baby and tells her that he worked it out so she and the baby go to college with him. She reveals that she had an abortion by her own choice, and tells Kenyon that he should focus on playing college basketball. He asked Kyra come with him to college with or without the baby and she agrees.  The Oilers eventually end up competing in the state CIF high school playoffs, but come up short to St. Francis by just 2 points after a game winning three-point shot by rivals Ty Crane. Nevertheless, Carter is proud of his players accomplishing their goals of having a proper education. The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics stating that a number of players went on to attend college and play basketball, such as Kenyon, Lyle, Junior, "Worm", Cruz, and Damien.

Louis decides to sponsor the judo team, buys them outfits, and asks MickaÃ«l to work with ClÃ©ment to perfect his technique and prepare the judo team for a French championship.  MickaÃ«l and ClÃ©ment relate well and while MickaÃ«l is a winning player, ClÃ©ment is smarter and understands the intrinsic rules of the game better. An incident occurs that forces MickaÃ«l to take the position of a wounded team mate and in doing so he must lose eight kilos to qualify for the championship team. The struggle to lose weight (he is already in ideal physical condition) places stress on both MickaÃ«l and his family and teammates. MickaÃ«l and Vanessa include ClÃ©ment in their camaraderie, a situation which evolves into a [[mÃ©nage Ã  trois]] as the three have group sex in the after hours gym. Vanessa reacts as though this is the greatest physical feeling ever, ClÃ©ment is smitten, and MickaÃ«l has troubling doubts. When the three decide to try it again in a hotel room MickaÃ«l is so conflicted that he does not join the other two, only listening to their cavorting in the bathtub feeling inferior to the smarter, wealthier ClÃ©ment. But on the judo side, the team plays the championship and MickaÃ«l's delicate sense of [[self worth]] is restored for a moment. It is the manner in which the trio of teenagers resolve their antics that closes the film.  
A Cock and Bull Story
 The film depicts [[Steve Coogan]] playing himself as an arrogant actor with low self-esteem and a complicated love life. Coogan is playing the eponymous role in an adaptation of ''The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman'' being filmed at a stately home. He constantly spars with actor [[Rob Brydon]], who is playing Uncle Toby and believes his role to be of equal importance to Coogan's, calling himself the "co-lead".  The film incorporates several sequences from ''Tristram Shandy''. Not all of these are part of the film-within-the-film. The latter are limited to the story of Tristram's conception, birth and christening; Uncle Toby's experiences at the [[Siege of Namur (1695)|Battle of Namur]] and Tristram's sudden and accidental [[circumcision]] at the age of three. Uncle Toby's wooing of Widow Wadman (Gillian Anderson) takes place in a sequence dreamed by Steve Coogan and after the cast and crew have viewed the "completed" film ending, with Walter Shandy fainting at the sight of his wife giving birth, the question "How does the book end?" is followed by the concluding scene of the novel, in which Yorick says "It is a story about a Cock and a Bull â and the best of its kind that ever I heard!" Yorick is not in the film-within-the-film; in this scene he is played by [[Stephen Fry]], who appears elsewhere in the film as Patrick, a caricatured version of the actual curator at [[Shandy Hall]]. The DVD extras include a scene of Fry talking with the curator he portrays.

Colour Me Kubrick
 ''Colour Me Kubrick'' begins with a direct homage to ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' with the after-effects of one of [[Alan Conway]]'s (Malkovich) minor [[confidence trick|cons]]: two thugs are sent to collect a bar bill that Conway has generated by impersonating Kubrick. Conway has provided the address of an elderly couple as Kubrick's home address. Conway is nowhere to be seen, and the thugs are arrested by the police for causing a ruckus outside the house.  Following these events, the audience is taken through several of Conway's scams, including tricking a fashion designer, members of a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band, and a popular bar owner. All of the victims are deceived into giving in to "Kubrick" for sums of money, free food and drinks, and even sexual favours. Conway actually knows little about Kubrick or his films, so he simply puts on a different persona&mdash;from reserved English gentleman to flamboyant [[Jewish]] stereotype&mdash;with each victim. Conway deceives just about everyone he meets into thinking he is the reclusive director, except for a [[rent boy]] at a bar, who tests Conway by saying that his favourite Kubrick film is ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]''; when Conway begins an anecdote about directing the film, the young man tells him that ''Judgment at Nuremberg'' was directed by [[Stanley Kramer|Stanley ''Kramer'']], and Conway walks away.  Conway also has a run-in with [[Frank Rich]] ([[William Hootkins]]), a journalist from the ''[[New York Times]]''. He meets Rich and his wife in a restaurant and confronts him about an article the ''New York Times'' ran on the real Kubrick. He is personally offended that the paper called Kubrick a [[recluse]], and wants them to know that he shaved off his beard. After this chance meeting, Rich investigates Kubrick and finds a picture of him, learning that the real Kubrick looks nothing like the man he met in the restaurant. Rich then instigates Kubrick to look further into the identity of the con man.  One of the biggest scams is when Conway promises to help establish Lee Pratt ([[Jim Davidson]]) as a headliner act in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]. Pratt is a British entertainer who's had limited success as a flamboyant dancer and stage singer. Pratt is described as a "low-rent [[Liberace]] with an [[Elvis]] gleam in his eye."<ref name=plotquote></ref> Conway makes huge promises to get Pratt a permanent seat in the spotlight in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]. While Pratt, Conway and Pratt's manager try to decide how to conquer America, Conway lives a life of luxury at Pratt's expense. He sleeps in a high class hotel consuming vodka and cigarettes until a cleaning woman, possibly under the direction of Pratt's manager, discovers a passport with his real moniker printed inside. Conway is thrown out of Pratt's life and off of a pier in a visual and musical homage to ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''.  From there, Rich exposes Alan's lies, and Conway is sent to a hospital after an apparent [[nervous breakdown]] which, of course, is just another one of Conway's elaborate ruses. His case is published by his doctor in the medical literature and, courtesy of the British government, he is sent to the [[Rimini]] Clinic, a centre where celebrities go for [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]]. Conway is shown to be living the good life, and the film ends with him relaxing in a giant, luxurious hot tub whilst the [[Ray Noble (musician)|Ray Noble Orchestra]] plays the [[Al Bowlly]] version of "Midnight, the Stars and You" on the soundtrack, harking back to the finale of ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.

Constantine (film)
    [[God]] and [[Lucifer]] have a standing wager for mankind's souls. [[Angel]]s and [[demon]]s are forbidden to manifest on Earth; instead, their hybrid offspring influence humans.  In the Mexican countryside, a scavenger named Manuel finds a spearhead wrapped in a [[Nazi flag]] at the ruins of an old church, which is later revealed as the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Destiny]]. Manuel becomes possessed and travels to the United States.  [[John Constantine]] exorcises a [[Filipina]] girl possessed by a demon trying to break through to Earth, which should not be possible under the wager's rules. He meets with the [[androgyny|androgynous]] half-angel being [[List of Hellblazer characters#Archangel Gabriel|Gabriel]]. He asks Gabriel for a reprieve from his impending death from lung cancer brought forth by prolonged smoking. Gabriel declines, telling Constantine that he exorcises demons for selfish reasons and can not buy his way into Heaven.  After being assaulted by another demon, Constantine goes to Papa Midnite, a reputed [[witch doctor]] who runs a club serving as neutral ground where half-breeds do not have to conceal themselves. Midnite does not believe Constantine's claim of demons crossing over. Constantine leaves, after exchanging hostile words with half-demon Balthazar.  Elsewhere, a woman named Isabel Dodson commits suicide in a psychiatric hospital. Her twin sister, Detective Angela Dodson, refuses to believe that Isabel, a devout Roman Catholic, would kill herself. Watching security footage of Isabel's suicide, Angela hears her say Constantine's name. Angela finds Constantine and asks him to help investigate. After they are attacked by winged demons, which Constantine believes were targeting Angela, he agrees to help.  Constantine briefly transports himself to Hell through the possession of a [[familiar]] and sees Isabel damned to eternally relive her suicide. Constantine explains to Angela that he can see the true nature of the half-breeds. He committed suicide to escape his visions and his soul was sent to Hell, but he was revived by paramedics two minutes later; for the sin of taking his own life, his soul is still condemned to go to Hell once he dies. The two examine Isabel's room in the hospital and find a clue pointing to a prophecy in the Satanic Bible that Lucifer's son, [[Mammon]], will attempt to claim Earth as his own kingdom. To do so, Mammon requires both a powerful psychic and assistance from God.  Angela tells Constantine that Isabel, a clairvoyant and a psychic, was [[Involuntary commitment|committed]] by her parents. Angela had the same gift but suppressed it. At Angela's insistence, Constantine reawakens her psychic ability through a [[near death experience]]. She immediately finds a clue pinpointing Balthazar as an accomplice to the plot; Constantine interrogates Balthazar, who reveals that Mammon has the Spear, stained with the [[blood of Christ]] â the assistance from God. Angela, now the psychic in place of Isabel, is abducted by an invisible entity.  Constantine convinces Midnite that the demons are breaking the wager's rules. With Midnite's help, Constantine finds out how the Spear emerged and Angela's location. Constantine arms himself and goes to the hospital, accompanied by his driver and apprentice [[Chas Chandler (comics)|Chas Kramer]]. The two fight their way through an army of half-demons to exorcise Angela. Chas is killed by the invisible entity, which turns out to be Gabriel. Resenting God's favoritism towards humans, Gabriel plans to unleash Hell on Earth to weed out those deemed "unworthy" of God's love. Gabriel casts Constantine from the room and prepares to use the Spear to cut Mammon free from Angela.  Out of options, Constantine slits his wrists. As he bleeds out, Lucifer arrives to personally collect his soul. Constantine tells Lucifer of Mammon's plan to usurp him. Confronted by Lucifer, Gabriel threatens to 'smite' him in God's honor; however, the attack towards Lucifer comes up short, revealing to both Gabriel and Lucifer that Gabriel no longer has divine protection. Lucifer proceeds to burn Gabriel's wings, making Gabriel mortal. Lucifer banishes Mammon back to Hell and grants Constantine any wish; Constantine asks that Isabel be released to Heaven. Lucifer complies but realizes too late that he cannot take Constantine to Hell as a consequence; by selflessly sacrificing himself, Constantine is granted entry to Heaven. Infuriated, Lucifer heals Constantine's injuries and cures him of his lung cancer, hoping he will eventually damn himself again. Angela and Constantine depart, leaving the now human Gabriel. Sometime later, Constantine, now making an effort to quit smoking, entrusts the Spear to Angela and visits Chas' grave, where Chas appears in an angelic form and flies away.  
The Constant Gardener (film)
 Justin Quayle, a low-level British diplomat and horticultural hobbyist posted in Kenya, learns that his wife Tessa was found dead in the [[veld]]. Tessa has been murdered at a crossroads along with her Kenyan driver. Her colleague, Dr. Arnold Bluhm, is initially suspected of her murder but is later found to have himself been murdered on the same day as Tessa. Various rumours abound that the two were having an affair; however, it is later revealed that Bluhm was gay.  In flashbacks, we see how in London, Justin met his future wife Tessa, an outspoken humanitarian and [[Amnesty International]] activist. He falls in love with her, and she persuades him to take her back with him to Kenya. Despite their loving marriage, Tessa keeps from Justin the reason why she approached him in the first place: to investigate a suspicious drug trial in Kenya and expose it. When Tessa starts getting too close to uncovering the malpractices of an influential and powerful pharmaceutical company, she and her colleague are brutally murdered.  As the mystery surrounding his wife's death unfolds, Justin becomes determined to get to the bottom of her murder. He soon runs up against a drug corporation that is using Kenya's population for fraudulent testing of a tuberculosis drug. The drug has known harmful side effects, but the corporation completely disregards the well-being of its underprivileged African test subjects.  Sir Bernard Pellegrin heads the Africa Desk at the [[Foreign Office]] and is the boss both of Justin and the British [[High Commissioner]], Sandy Woodrow. In his investigations, Justin discovers that Tessa hid from him a report about the deaths caused by Dypraxa, and he obtains an incriminating letter that Tessa took from Sandy. Justin confronts Sandy, who tells him that what Tessa wanted was to stop the Dypraxa tests and redesign the drug. However, this would have cost millions of dollars and significantly delayed the drug's release, during which time other competing drugs would have surfaced. Pellegrin considered Tessa's report too damaging and proclaimed she had to be stopped. The company threatens Justin: he must stop his investigations or meet his wife's fate. In one instance, agents are sent to beat him up.  Still determined, Justin takes a UN aid plane to the village where the doctor lives who provided Tessa with the clinical data behind her report. The doctor gives Justin a copy of the report, but the village is raided by armed tribesmen on horseback, and Justin and the doctor are forced to flee from the carnage. Justin has the plane drop him off at the place where Tessa died. There he thinks about Tessa; he tells her memory that he knows all her secrets, that he understands her now, and that he is coming home. Following his reverie, he is killed in an organized hit.  At Tessa and Justin's funeral, Justin's lawyer reads the incriminating letter written by Pellegrin to Woodrow. In the letter, Pellegrin ordered the surveillance of Tessa, expressly to block her reports detailing the deaths caused by Dypraxa, and explains that the company could not be held responsible for the Dypraxa deaths if it never officially received the reports. The scandal having been revealed, Pellegrin leaves the ceremony followed by journalists.

 In a village in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, Victor Van Dort, the son of [[nouveau riche]] fish merchants, and Victoria Everglot, the neglected daughter of snobbish yet [[impoverished]] [[aristocrat]]s, are preparing for their [[arranged marriage]], which will simultaneously raise the [[social class]] of Victor's parents and restore the wealth of Victoria's penniless family. Both have concerns about marrying someone they do not know, but upon meeting for the first time, they fall for each other. After the shy Victor ruins the wedding rehearsal by forgetting his vows, he flees and practices his wedding vows in the nearby forest, placing the wedding ring on a nearby upturned tree root. The root turns out to be the finger of a murdered woman in a tattered [[Wedding dress|bridal gown]] named Emily, who rises from the grave claiming that she is now Victor's wife. After fainting, Victor wakes up and finds himself spirited away to the Land of the Dead. The bewildered Victor learns the story of how Emily was murdered years ago by an unknown perpetrator on the night of her secret elopement.

She agrees to this and takes him to see Elder Gutknecht, the kindly ruler of the underworld, to return Victor and Emily temporarily to the Land of the Living. Once back home, Victor asks Emily to wait in the forest while he rushes off to see Victoria and confess his wish to marry her as soon as possible, to which she gladly returns his feelings.

Angry, Gervais has Zac see a [[Psychologist|therapist]] to [[conversion therapy|"cure"]] him of his homosexuality. The therapist's conclusion was that Zac made "a subconscious deliberate mistake", intentionally doing it so that Gervais would catch him and find out he was gay.  At the Christmas dinner in 1980, Zac and Michelle's relationship has become closer and more physical. His brother Christian announces his engagement. At Christian's wedding reception, Zac and Paul shotgun a [[joint (cannabis)|joint]] outside, but are seen by a guest who thought they were kissing. Gervais overhears this gossip, and chaos ensues.

Conversations with Other Women
 At a wedding reception, a man in his late thirties ([[Aaron Eckhart|Eckhart]]) approaches a [[bridesmaid]] ([[Helena Bonham Carter|Bonham Carter]]) of about the same age, and offers her a glass of champagne. As conversation ensues, they begin to flirt. Witty small talk about such topics as the wedding party and their own past relationships gradually reveals to the viewing film audience that they are not strangers, but in fact that they share an intimate past. A series of flashback scenes shows much younger versions of the two of them as lovers.  Despite having significant others (22-year-old Sarah the dancer and Geoffrey the cardiologist, both absent) the couple choose to go upstairs to her hotel room together. However, their decision to sleep together is one which is clearly complex and fraught with [[emotional baggage]] for each of them. Again with flashbacks, a series of vignettes juxtaposes their earlier selves against the older, perhaps wiser couple in the hotel room.   The two reminisce and reassess their feelings for each other. He appears to have ambiguous feelings about the direction of his life, while she seems more adjusted to her life choices. The emotional fulfillment the two experienced in their youth has the appearance of causing them to reflect on their current lives in comparison to the choices and options they had while much younger.  She must catch a transatlantic flight home to London in the morning, so the two leave the hotel together in the early morning. As they return to their separate lives, each speculates with their cab driver on the future and the difficulty of being happy.

Tanner and Harold find the body and assume it was Jimmy who killed Lily.  On the night of a local festivity, Jimmy dons a [[goth]]ic costume and make-up he wore to the celebration a previous year. He finds and kills Pestilence in a bar. He then seizes the hearse carrying Lily's body, and buries her near the tree where he carved a love symbol for them both. Jimmy goes to a casino and kills Famine in front of Luc. A fight ensues between Jimmy and Luc during which the crow, the source of Jimmy's power, is injured, thereby weakening Jimmy. Tanner finds Jimmy and accuses him of killing Lily, but Jimmy shows Tanner [[telepathy|telepathically]] what really happened.  Luc and Lola visit El NiÃ±o ([[Dennis Hopper]]), the head of their order, at a Catholic church which has been abandoned by Christians and has been modified for use by the satanic cult. Tanner and Harold and a group of men assemble outside to confront them. As El NiÃ±o is performing the marriage ceremony that will bring Luc closer to the power he craves, Jimmy, Tanner, Harold, and the other men arrive and shoot War. El NiÃ±o completes the ceremony as Jimmy enters the church. Luc, now a host for [[Lucifer]] himself [[telekinesis|telekinetically]] hangs Jimmy from a cross, while Lola kills El NiÃ±o. Luc and Lola leave the church and head to a nearby graveyard where they must consummate their ritual before sunrise in order for Lucifer to fully manifest.  Harold, Tanner, and the others free Jimmy, who tells them the crow is dying. In order to heal the bird and restore Jimmy's powers, Harold performs the Crow Dance. Weakened, Jimmy heads to the graveyard and stops Luc from having sex with Lola. Luc and Jimmy engage in a fight and the revived crow returns, restoring Jimmy's invulnerability. The sun rises and Luc's ritual is destroyed. Jimmy then kills Luc by impaling him on a wooden spike and cutting his throat. Lola loses her sight and tries to repent by praying to the [[Virgin Mary]], but it is too late: Harold apprehends her and takes her to prison. Jimmy and Lily's spirits find each other in the afterlife.

Jimmy had a run-in with some bullies and his crush, Brooke. Driving home, Jimmy and Ellie collide with an animal and another car. They attempt to rescue the other driver, Becky Morton, but an unseen creature slashes the siblings before it drags Becky off and rips her in half.  When interviewed by police, despite Jimmy's belief that it was a wolf or dog-type animal, the official report credits it to a bear or cougar.  Jimmy does research about wolves in California and starts to believe that the creature was a [[werewolf]], sharing his thoughts with a disbelieving Ellie. Later, Ellie is surprised to find herself attracted to the smell of blood on a co-worker, but eases her concerns by touching a silver picture frame and not getting burned. Jimmy is becoming much stronger and more aggressive, as shown when a bully named Bo coerces him to join the [[Scholastic wrestling|wrestling team]]. He easily defeats three wrestlers, including Bo, and calls Bo out for constantly making gay jokes towards him, saying that Bo himself is [[Closeted|repressing his own homosexuality]].  At a party, Jenny runs into Joanie, who is paying attention to Jake. Jenny leaves the party, while Jake and Joanie leave as the [[Full moon#In folklore and tradition|full moon]] rises.

Their dog, Zipper,<ref></ref> bites Jimmy, tastes his blood, becomes a lycanthropoid monster, and goes on a rampage. Realizing what's happening, Jimmy goes to warn Ellie with Bo, who showed up at their house to confess that he is gay and has feelings for Jimmy; Bo is flatly rejected, but still helps Jimmy.  Ellie has deduced that Jake is a werewolf. He confirms it, but claims it wasn't he who attacked her and Jimmy. When a fourth werewolf attacks them, Bo and Jimmy try to help, but Bo is knocked out. The new werewolf turns back into Joanie, who was cursed after a [[one-night stand]] with Jake. She now wants revenge by killing all of the other girls Jake dates. When Jake refuses to let Joanie hurt Ellie, she knocks him out, then turns into werewolf form and starts attacking. Ellie and Jimmy fight her, and when the police arrive, the two draw her out by insulting her. The police open fire, apparently killing her in werewolf form, but she rises again as her head and heart are still connected.  A policeman shoots her in the head, finally killing her. Bo is okay, but Jake has disappeared.  Jimmy and Ellie return to a wrecked home. As Jimmy works to restore the power, Jake arrives. He reveals that he did bite Ellie and Jimmy, and wants to kill Jimmy (due to his Alpha male instinct) and have Ellie live forever by his side. She and Jake fight, but her werewolf form emerges sporadically while he has complete control over his, dominating the fight. Werewolf Jimmy joins in, climbing across the ceiling and biting Jake, allowing Ellie to stab and badly injure Jake with a silver cake server. Ellie decapitates Jake with a shovel and breaks the curse on the two siblings (and Zipper). They watch as Jake's body [[Spontaneous combustion|bursts into flames]].

The group considers who could have murdered Becky, when Dodger proposes expanding Cry Wolf to the entire school. Owen suggests creating a fake e-mail telling everyone about a [[serial killer]] who goes from campus to campus killing students. They describe the killer as wearing an orange ski mask, a camouflage jacket and brandishing a hunting knife. That night, they send out the e-mail.  The next day, the entire school has spread the story in the e-mail. Owen receives an instant message from someone using the name "Wolf".

In his journalism class the next day, when Owen reaches into his bag for supplies, a hunting knife falls out. Mr. Walker escorts Owen to the Headmistress's office.

Suddenly Mr. Walker enters the room. After noticing that Mr. Walker has a jacket, an orange mask and a knife, Owen shoots him. The door is suddenly opened by Dodger, Tom and Regina.  Owen is arrested for murder. The group admits that it was a prank to get Mercedes and Owen back for making them stay on campus. It is discovered that Mr. Walker was involved with Becky, the gun in his desk being the same one that killed her. Dodger visits Owen, and says that she would never have played the game if she knew that Mr. Walker was cheating on her, revealing she had organized everything. She had killed Becky because she was jealous of Mr. Walker's relationship with her. She had set up the game, knowing that Owen would blame Mr. Walker for the killings, thereby killing him and making her happy. Owen threatens to report her, to which she replies that no one would believe him.   
Noroi: The Curse
 The film focuses on Masafumi Kobayashi, a paranormal expert who produced a series of books and documentaries on supernatural activity around [[Japan]]. He disappeared in the process of making his most disturbing documentary, ''The Curse''. His house burnt down and his wife Keiko was found dead in the ruins. The aforementioned movie begins to play, shown mostly through the recordings of Kobayashi's [[cameraman]] Miyajima.  Kobayashi investigates a woman named Junko Ishii and her son after her neighbor hears strange noises coming from her house. Kobayashi learns Ishii has moved out and finds dead [[pigeon]]s surrounding her house. Ishii's neighbor and her daughter die in a mysterious car crash a week later. Kana Yano, a girl who exhibits [[psychic powers]] on a variety television program, disappears shortly after. Speaking to her parents, Kobayashi learns a man named Mitsuo Hori visited Kana. Hori, a strange, psychic man who wears a [[tin foil]] hat and coat, claims Kana was taken by "''ectoplasmic worms''", drawing an obscure map of a blue building and asking Kobayashi what "''Kagutaba''" is. Kobayashi and Miyajima track the blue building to a nearby apartment block where they witness a man, Osawa, taking pigeons into his house. He is later reported to have gone missing.  Actress [[Marika Matsumoto]] is haunted by a malevolent spirit whilst filming at a shrine and unknowingly sleepwalks and fashions looped [[noose]]s from wires. Kobayashi records her, discovering a deep voice on the tape that says Kagutaba, which Marika identifies as a voice she heard at the shrine. Kobayashi learns that Kagutaba is a [[Oni|demon]] summoned by a religious village called Shimokage, but they imprisoned it underground for disobeying them. An annual ritual was performed to appease Kagutaba, but the village was demolished in 1978 to make way for a dam. Kobayashi is shown the recorded final ritual by a historian, where the daughter of the ritual priest is possessed by Kagutaba. Kobayashi tracks the daughter down, discovering she is Junko Ishii. Kobayashi learns Ishii worked at a nursing school where she helped with illegal abortions and stole the fetuses.  Marika visits Kobayashi, revealing her neighbor hanged herself using similar nooses. Six other people died too, including Osawa. She feels extremely guilty over their deaths, and Kobayashi decides to let her stay at his house with his wife. Kobayashi learns Ishii likely influenced Osawa to worship Kagutaba. Marika exhibits demonic possession and pigeons fly into a window beside her and die; she, Kobayashi and Hori go to the Shimokage dam to perform the ritual so Marika can be free of Kagutaba. They perform the ritual, only for Hori to run off in panic, claiming to see Kana. Marika exhibits demonic possession again. Kobayashi and Hori find a secluded shrine, finding the villagers' ritual dogs slaughtered. Kobayashi sees a vision of Kana with undead fetuses crawling around her feet and on her body. Marika comes out of the possession trance, and both she and Hori are taken to a hospital.  Kobayashi and Miyajima find Ishii has hanged herself. They find Kana's body and Ishii's young son alive; Kobayashi adopts the boy, who is discovered to not be Ishii's biological son. The historian shows Kobayashi a scroll describing how Kagutaba was first summoned. Baby monkeys were fed to a medium; Ishii tried replicating this by feeding the stolen fetuses to Kana. Marika recovers, whilst Hori is placed in a mental institution, only to escape and be found dead a day later.  After Kobayashi's disappearance, Miyajima receives his video camera, which shows events that led to the destruction of Kobayashi's house: a crazed Hori attacks Ishii's son, and Kobayashi sees through the camera that the bloodied boy has taken on the appearance of Kagutaba while Kana's ghost stands in a corner. It is implied Ishii's "son" is actually the demon, Kagutaba, itself and Ishii was the one being commanded by her "son" and not the other way around. Keiko suddenly becomes possessed and [[self-immolation|sets herself alight]], while Hori leaves with the "boy". The film ends noting Kobayashi and the boy are still missing.

In the following scene, Mercedes is seduced by his employee Matt Cody (Owen Hawk). They engage in sexual activity on the conference table in the boardroom when the cleaning guy (Mario Ortiz) shows up and joins in.  Meanwhile, Moore sets up his photography session with Lacroix and engages another model, J., to seduce Lacroix. Lacroix is later guilt-ridden.  Cody meets with Von Halpern, who wants to solicit information about Cody's boss, Von Halpern's ex-boyfriend, Mercedes.  Another sex scene ensues. Von Halpern's current boyfriend Bobby (Bruce Beckham) discovers Von Halpern's [[infidelity]] and seduces Moore to get even. Since Von Halpern has reneged on his payment to Moore in the form of a night together, Moore responds favorably to Bobby's advances.  The [[cameo appearance]]s occur during the final scene, set as the [[Vernissage|opening]] night of Moore's new gallery exhibit. There is an additional plot twist as a main character is murdered at the end.<ref name="Retail description" />  
Dame sobh
  Mansour Ziaee ([[Hossein Yari]]) is a prison inmate in Iran's capital Tehran, who is awaiting his execution for murder. The film outlines his previous story in brief flashbacks: He is from the small village ''Zir Ab'' (probably a fictitious village since the [[Zir Ab (disambiguation)|four existing Iranian places of that name]] are not in the north of Tehran), where his family was farming sheep. Hoping for a better future, he convinced his parents and his wife to move to Tehran, but once there, faced difficulties keeping the job he had counted on. Although the crime he committed and its immediate antecedents are never directly shown, it appears that he killed someone, probably his employer, with a brick stone on a busy street in broad daylight. He is apprehended on the spot and later sentenced to death.  Under the [[Sharia|Islamic law]] used in Iran, the family of the victim has the power to pardon the perpetrator's life, and they have to be present at the execution. Ziaee's execution had to be delayed twice already because the family failed to come, when the film sets in on the morning of the third date fixed for his execution. The camera follows him through the procedures before an execution can take place, but ultimately, the victim's family again does not show up, and the execution is postponed for another 40 days.   While his fellow prison inmates celebrate the cancellation, the stressful uncertainty between life and death takes its toll, and Ziaee withdraws more and more from the world around him. He does not want to see his family anymore, who has moved back to Zir Ab because they felt lonely in Tehran, he attempts [[suicide]] and provokes to be sent to solitary confinement. He finally finds back to some joy of life when his wife gives birth to their first child. Soon afterwards, however, his execution is appointed for the fourth time. After a haunting dream of finally being hanged, the film leaves Ziaee as he walks off to the room where he will either meet the victim's family or be stood up again.

Dangerous Men
 The plot of ''Dangerous Men'' is somewhat unclear, and changes abruptly towards the middle of the film.  Mina (Melody Wiggins) and her fiancÃ©, Daniel (Coti Cook) are walking on a beach when two bikers, named Tiger and Leo, set upon them. They kill the fiancÃ© and attempt to rape Mina. In the struggle, Leo is killed and Tiger goes to leave the beach. Mina insists that he take her along, secretly plotting his murder.  After taking Mina for a steak dinner at a motel, Tiger retires with her to their room. Mina distracts Tiger by having him rub her knees and lick her bellybutton before producing a knife hidden in her buttocks and stabbing him to death, taking revenge for her  fiancÃ©.  Mina flees into the desert, where she is picked up by a British man driving a pickup truck. The driver pulls over and attempts to rape Mina at gunpoint. She threatens to castrate him with her knife and sends him off, nude, to wander the desert. The film follows him for approximately 5 minutes as he narrates his own misfortune, occasionally addressing his own penis. He is seen singing and dancing as he wanders about. Eventually a van passes him by and he is pelted with garbage.  Mina visits a prostitute and asks her to teach her to be "one of the girls of the night"- a ruse which she uses to kill several potential Johns with her knife. Mina's campaign of murders is reported on the news and comes to the attention of the police.  A police detective (who is the brother of Mina's fiancÃ©) begins investigating a biker gang (led by the as-yet unseen Black Pepper, played by Bryan Jenkins), despite nominally being on vacation. He pays a bartender $300 for information about the bikers. Later, the detective tails one biker onto the beach where he is attempting to rape a young woman (Annali Aeristos). The detective chokes him into unconsciousness.  In the next scene, the biker gang is driving in a convoy. The biker from the previous scene is distracted by the young woman he failed to rape- who is sunning herself on the hood of a car by the roadside. Unbeknownst to him, the detective is concealed in the car, wearing a bulletproof vest and motorcycle helmet. When the biker pulls over to once again attempt to rape the young woman, the police detective attempts to intervene. However, he spends several minutes attempting to extricate his foot which is stuck under a seat. Eventually he frees himself and chokes the biker into unconsciousness.  The detective drives away with the biker bound in his back seat. He learns Black Pepper's location and drives to the foot of the hill where his house is located.  In an unrelated scene, Mina is arrested by several other police officers in a public park.  In the house, Black Pepper and a young woman watch a belly dancer perform. They then retire to Black Pepper's bedroom. They are interrupted in an amorous moment by one of Black Pepper's subordinates who tells him the police have arrived. After a fight in the house, Black Pepper flees into the brush and is pursued by the police chief.  The chief chases Black Pepper through a small cave and into a neighboring house. Black Pepper is poised to rape the young blind woman who lives in the house. However, she produces a pistol from under her sewing and starts firing at Black Pepper. Shortly after, the chief arrives and arrests Black Pepper. The film abruptly ends on a freeze frame.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

Dark Water (2005 film)
 Dahlia battles her ex-husband Kyle for [[Child custody|custody]] of their daughter Cecilia. Kyle wants Cecilia to live closer to his apartment in [[Jersey City]], but Dahlia wants to move to the cheaper [[Roosevelt Island]], where she has found a good school.  Dahlia and Cecilia view an apartment in a dilapidated complex on Roosevelt Island, a few blocks from Cecilia's new school. Cecilia sneaks to the roof and finds a [[Hello Kitty]] backpack near the building's [[water tower]]; the manager, Murray, explains that no one has claimed it. Cecilia initially dislikes the apartment but decides she wants to live there. Dahlia makes an offer the same day.  Shortly after they move in, the bedroom ceiling begins to leak dark water. Dahlia finds the apartment above flooded from every faucet. She finds a family portrait of the former tenants, the Rimsky family: a mother, father, and a girl Cecilia's age. Dahlia complains to Murray and the superintendent Veeck about the water, but Veeck insists that he is not a plumber and blames teenage vandals. The ceiling, shoddily patched by Veeck, leaks again. Dahlia is intimidated by teenagers in the apartment, and sees the face of a screaming girl in a washing machine.  Cecilia's teacher is troubled by Cecilia's "[[imaginary friend]]", Natasha. Cecilia appears to argue with Natasha and lose control of her hand as she paints. After Dahlia catches Cecilia playing with dolls and talking to Natasha in the elevator, she forbids Cecilia to talk to Natasha again. In the bathroom, Cecilia passes out as dark water gushes from the toilets and sinks. As Dahlia is busy meeting her lawyer, Jeff Platzer, Kyle takes Cecilia to his apartment.   That night, Dahlia follows footsteps to the roof and sees that water is spilling from the water tower. Inside she finds Natasha's body. Veeck is arrested for negligence; he was aware of her body, which was why he refused to fix the complex's plumbing problems. Dahlia and Platzer discover that Natasha's parents had left her behind, each believing she was with the other. Natasha was left to fend for herself, and fell into the water tower and drowned, leaving her as a vengeful ghost who is jealous of Cecilia.   Dahlia agrees to move closer to Kyle so shared custody will be easier. As she packs, a girl in a hooded bathrobe who resembles Cecilia asks her to read to her. When Dahlia hears Cecilia playing in the bathtub, she realizes that the girl is Natasha. Natasha begs Dahlia not to leave but Dahlia rushes into the bathroom to save Cecilia. Natasha locks Cecilia in the shower compartment and holds her underwater. Dahlia pleads with Natasha to let her daughter go, promising to be her mother forever. Floods overwhelm the apartment, and Natasha and the ghost of Dahlia walk the hall as mother and daughter.  Three weeks later, Kyle and Cecilia pick up the rest of their belongings. In the elevator, Dahlia's ghost braids Cecilia's hair, telling her she will always be with her.  
Day of the Dead 2: Contagium
 In 1968, an infected man from Russia, Rubinsky, is being operated on at a [[military hospital]] when soldiers arrive and begin to shoot all of those who are in the building. One of the hospital students steals a strange vial, enclosing it in his thermos. He is later shot by the soldiers as he attempts to escape through the woods and the thermos is dropped. The soldiers in the hospital continue to kill any one that has been in contact with the infected man. The zombies are killed when C4 is detonated by sharpshooters outside the hospital.  Thirty-seven years later, a group of patients at the same hospital, consisting of Boris, Jackie, Isaac, Sam,  and their doctor, Donwynn, uncover a strange thermos buried in the soil in the yard of a hospital. Sam attempts to open it, but they are unable due to it being rusted shut. Donwynn entrusts Sam with keeping it safe, but Isaac feels that something bad will happen if the thermos is opened. While Sam and Boris are distracted with watching a movie, Jackie sneaks away with the thermos and runs to the bathroom to open it. Sam discovers that Jackie stole the thermos, and with Boris, Isaac, and Emma, they go to the bathroom to talk him out of opening it. Jackie opens the thermos, and a strange object falls from it, unknowingly releasing a virus, infecting the entire group. Doctor Heller talks to Donwynn about his patientsâ behavior and claims that Jackie and the other patients are breaking the rules of the hospital. That night, those who were in the bathroom begin to show signs of sickness. Donwynn contacts a friend about the item that was in the thermos.  The next day, Donwynn awakes to discover Sam having a seizure and the rest discover that they all have skin on their bodies that is dead and peeling. Emma has tests ran on her, and she is told that she is pregnant. Emma attacks Marshall when he keeps bothering her about the results of her test, and she bites him on the arm, infecting him. Sam, Jackie and Boris begin to show advanced signs of infection, including rotting flesh, varicose veins, and coughing up blood. Marshall is quarantined because of the infection from the bite. Dr. Heller puts the hospital under a full quarantine and gives the doctors the right to bear arms, along with orders to shoot anyone from Dorm 1 in the head that attacks them. Donwynn receives a video from his friend who says not to open the thermos because it contains a deadly virus that mutates human [[DNA]]. Donwynn informs Sam that he plans to visit the hospital the next day. Marshall dies of his infection that night.  The next morning, everyone is called to the front desk of the hospital to receive a vial of medicine. Ava informs Donwynn that the virus is flesh-eating and kills its host. Patty and Vicky get into a fight, which is broken up by Derber. Pete senses that Donwynn smells dead, and goes crazy. This gives Patty a chance to steal one of Derberâs handguns, and escape to see Emma. Patty shoots and kills one of the security guards in order to open Emma's room. Marshall reanimates as a zombie and kills Dr. Heller, who has stopped in to study the advancement of the infection. Donwynn has jumped out of a window to try to find out why the hospital is quarantined, and observes the killing of Heller. While trying to find Emma, Patty shoots Isaac, but he revives and is unharmed. Marshall breaks free from his cell and kills a security guard.  Donwynn's friend arrives at the hospital just as Donwynn returns to the hospital, and informs the patients of what the virus truly is, and how it works. He also reveals that each of them are dead âby human standards.â He also reveals that those infected with the virus are highly contagious, and informs the patients of how the virus was first released. The zombified Marshall is shot to death by the hospitalâs police force. Jackie attacks Donwynn's friend and slams his head into the door, opening a wound. Boris, no longer able to contain his blood lust, mutates into a zombie, and bites him, causing Jackie and Sam to attack him as well. The three devour him while Isaac, Donwynn and Emma run to the doctor's office, outside of the dorm. Jackie, Sam and Boris have completely turned to zombies and they taunt the surviving patients from inside the dorm.  Early the next morning, Dr. Heller has reanimated as a zombie.  He enters the room where Vicky is hiding, but he is distracted by the infected Charlie who he chases away. The patients in the dining room all reanimate as zombies and begin to devour the police officers. The survivors escape into the kitchen of the hospital, but are forced to retreat into the back hallway. Patty finds Vicky in the medical room, and kills her while searching for Emma. The majority of the zombies escape from the hospital and head out into the city. The survivors manage to reach the medical room, where Emma goes into labor and the last police officer is killed. The zombies begin to kill people in the city, Charlie among the victims. Boris, Jackie and Sam break into the room, attacking Isaac, Emma and Donwynn, trying to convince them that they donât want to hurt any of them, they just want them to turn and be a family. Boris kills Ava, and Isaac commits suicide with the last round of a pistol. The movie ends with the zombies attacking a camera crew recording the carnage.  
Dave Chappelle's Block Party
 [[File:Broken Angel House.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Broken Angel House, the site of the documentary, in May, 2007.]] The film follows Chappelle during the summer of 2004, up until September 18, 2004, when he threw a [[block party]] on the corner of Quincy Street and Downing Street in the [[Clinton Hill, Brooklyn|Clinton Hill]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]]. The film features nearby sites including the [[Broken Angel House]] in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn as well as areas in [[Fort Greene, Brooklyn]] and [[Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn]]. The film was produced before Chappelle's highly publicized decision to walk away from a $50 million deal to continue his hit ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', and gained prominence after the announcement.  He invited several [[hip hop]] and [[neo-soul]] musical artists to perform at the party, including [[Kanye West]], [[Mos Def]], [[Jill Scott]], [[Erykah Badu]], and [[The Roots]] along with The [[Central State University]] Marching Band. [[Lauryn Hill]] was also scheduled to perform at the party, but since [[Columbia Records]] refused to release her songs for use in the production, she decided instead to reunite [[The Fugees]] for the occasion. In addition, Chappelle performed comedy [[monologues]] and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] in between the musical acts.  
The Dark (film)
 While in Wales visiting her husband James ([[Sean Bean]]), AdÃ©lle ([[Maria Bello]]) tries to fix her relationship with her daughter Sarah ([[Sophie Stuckey]]). By the side of a cliff, they see a strange memorial with evidence of a plate missing and with the name "[[Annwyn]]" marked on it. A local man Dafydd ([[Maurice RoÃ«ves]]) explains that, according to traditional Welsh mythology, Annwyn is a sort of afterlife.  Later, Sarah vanishes on the beach, and another similar looking girl, named Ebrill (Welsh for "April"), appears in her place. Ebrill is the long-dead daughter of a local shepherd who also served as the town's pastor fifty years prior.  When Ebrill, who was a sickly child, died, her father gave her to the ocean, sending her to Annwyn.  He then convinced his followers to throw themselves into the ocean, claiming that it was the way to Paradise, while he privately hoped that their sacrifice would return Ebrill to him from Annwyn.  Ebrill did come back, but, something came back with her.  Her father tried to draw the evil out of her, through [[trepanning]] and locking her in her room.  Dafydd was one of the followers who did not throw himself off the cliff, though both his parents did.  Ebrill's father took him in, and when Dafydd could no longer bear witnessing the shepherd hurting Ebrill, he set her free, which in turn allowed the evil within her to lash out and shove her father over the cliff.  AdÃ©lle makes the connection that Ebrill is back once more because she has found a living substitute in Sarah, hence the film's tagline "One of the living for one of the dead".  In an attempt to rescue her daughter, AdÃ©lle throws both herself and Ebrill over the cliffs, despite James' protests, and sends them both to Annwyn, a sepia-toned, misty version of reality.  While in Annwyn, the film reveals that Sarah attempted suicide following an argument with her mother, resulting in their trip to Wales.  AdÃ©lle begs for a second chance with her daughter.  Ebrill informs her that the dead don't get second chances.  Ebrill and her father perform trepannation on AdÃ©lle, to draw out the evil within her.  AdÃ©lle eventually escapes her bonds and rushes to find Sarah, who is locked behind a door.  AdÃ©lle finds a key and tearfully apologizes for being so selfish.  In unlocking the door, AdÃ©lle is able to rescue Sarah from Annwyn, though, in doing so, AdÃ©lle sacrificed herself, only to realize too late that the Sarah she brought back was tainted by the same evil that had tainted Ebrill all those years ago.

The Death of Mr. Lazarescu
 Dante Remus LÄzÄrescu ([[Ioan Fiscuteanu]]), a cranky retired engineer, lives alone as a widower with his three cats in a Bucharest apartment. In the grip of extreme pain, LÄzÄrescu calls for an ambulance, but when none arrives, he asks for his neighbors' help. Not having the medicine LÄzÄrescu wants, the neighbors give him some pills for his nausea. A neighbor reveals that LÄzÄrescu is a heavy drinker. His neighbor helps LÄzÄrescu back to his apartment and to bed. They call again for an ambulance.   When the ambulance finally arrives, the nurse, Mioara ([[LuminiÅ£a Gheorghiu]]), dispels the idea that LÄzÄrescu's ulcer surgery over a decade before could cause this pain. While taking a patient history, she suspects that LÄzÄrescu has [[colon cancer]]. After informing his sister, who lives in a different city, that the condition could be serious and she should visit LÄzÄrescu in the hospital, the nurse decides to get him to a hospital. His sister makes arrangements to come the following day; his only child, a daughter, lives in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada.   The film follows LÄzÄrescu's journey through the night, as he is carried from one hospital to the next. At the first three hospitals, the doctors, after much delay, reluctantly agree to examine LÄzÄrescu. Then, although finding that he is gravely ill and needs emergency surgery, each team refuses to admit him and sends him to another hospital. Meanwhile, LÄzÄrescu's condition deteriorates rapidly, his speech is reduced to babbling, and he slowly loses consciousness. The hospitals are jammed with injured passengers from a bus accident, but some doctors appear to reject him out of fatigue or because they do not feel like taking care of a smelly old drunkard. During the night, his only advocate is Mioara, the paramedic who stubbornly stays by him and tries to get him hospitalized and treated, while passively accepting verbal abuse from the doctors who look down on her.  Finally, at the fourth hospital, the doctors admit LÄzÄrescu. They perform an emergency operation to remove a blood clot in his brain. One of the doctors comments that they have saved him so he can die from an incurable liver [[neoplasm]] which they had found.  
Dead Man's Bluff
 The film opens with a professor lecturing a group of university students. The professor says: "Start-up capital is how everything begins - it makes it possible to start a business and multiply the initial investment many times over. The key question is how to get start-up capital..." By way of example, she begins to tell a story that supposedly took place a decade earlier during the socioeconomic tumult in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union.  The movie then cuts to an interrogation scene that takes place in a morgue. The torturer continuously asks the gagged prisoner to talk, but it is unclear what the torturer desires to know. Before the torturer can kill the prisoner, three masked men enter and threaten the torturer at gunpoint. A gunfight ensues and one of the masked men is killed as well as the prisoner and the torturer has been shot in the stomach. One of the masked men takes of his disguise and it is revealed that he is a police officer named Stefan. The following events make it clear that he is a crooked officer. He asks the torturer what information Mikhailovich wanted from the prisoner and when the torturer gives no reply, Stepan shoots the man in the head and then shoots his own partner. The officer takes a piece of paper from the torturers pocket and seems excited by what he reads on it.  The movie then introduces the audience to three new gangsters who seem far less experienced than Simon and Sergei. Standing around and smoking cigarettes, the trio exchange banter that caters mainly to a Russian audience. The two Russian looking men in this group, Koron and Bala, consistently make their black partner, Baklazhan, the butt of their jokes. Even though he was born in Russia, the other two refuse to accept he is a Russian and insist on calling him the Ethiopian. The trio get a phone call from the Stepan who offers them work. They decide to meet at the zoo tomorrow to discuss the job.  The movie flashes to Nizhniy Novgorod in the mid-1990s. Simon and Sergei are two young hoodlums working for Sergei Mikhailovich, a local mob boss. Sergei Mikhailovich wears a magenta sports coat and uses a cell phone with an extendable antenna, a symbol of prosperity at that time. Upon learning that a chemist nicknamed "Doctor" has established a makeshift drug lab in the neighborhood, Sergei Mikhailovich sends Simon and Sergei to persuade Doctor to start paying him protection money. Sergei appears to be the smarter of the two hoods, doing all the talking. Simon is more taciturn: a ruthless killer with spring-loaded guns hidden in the wide sleeves of his trench coat. After Sergei explains why they are there, Doctor scoffs at them and before they can do anything, two of Doctor's associates appear. In the ensuing shoot-out, Sergei and Simon kill both the Doctor and his associates.  Sergei Mikhailovich is angry that the two hoods killed Doctor, because Mikhailovich stated that he needs Doctor for unknown purposes, but decides to give the duo another chance to make good. He tells Sergei and Simon to drive to the house of an attorney and exchange a suitcase full of money for a suitcase full of heroin. The two drive to a bar restaurant to relax and discuss the job. Unknown to the duo, a crooked cop named Stepan knows about the deal that is supposed to go down with the attorney. He hires Koron and his two associates, Bala and Baklazhan to intercept Sergei and Simon. The gangsters, wearing masks, hold up Sergei and Simon and take the suitcase from them at gunpoint, thinking that the suitcase is full of money. As they later learn, the switch had already happened and the suitcase is full of heroin.  When Sergei and Simon tell Sergei Mikhailovich what happened, he orders them to find Stepan, discover where the drugs were taken, and then kill him. The duo drive to Stepan's apartment, bind him, and begin to brutally torture him. Before long, Stepan tells them where to find the three gangsters who held them up. After that, Simon kills Stepan.  Using the information extracted from Stepan, Sergei and Simon drive to Koron's apartment, but find that Baklazhan is the only person there. Koron had left earlier to try to find Stepan, while Bala stepped out to buy some cigarettes. Sergei and Simon overpower and tie up Baklazhan. He swears that he has no idea who they are or what they are talking about. Sergei begins to search the apartment for the heroin. In the process, he finds a bag filled with guns and masks in the closet, proving that Baklazhan is lying to them.  Soon, a group of gangsters led by a criminal named Mozg (The Brain) show up at the apartment. They were a second group that Stepan had tried to use to hold up Sergei and Simon. The duo shoot all of them except for Mozg. He begins to threaten them. Sergei kills him with a sudden shot to the temple. Soon after, Koron and Bala return to the apartment. Sergei and Simon tie them up and, under threat of torture, Koron gives up the location of the heroin - it was hidden in the oven.  Sergei forces Koron and the two members of his gang to play Russian Roulette with him, which he calls "Zhmurki" (thus, the title of the film). Throughout the entire film, Sergei is seen carrying around a leather folder. In the course of the game, each time Sergei has to shoot at his own temple, he puts the folder between himself and the gun, suggesting that it is for luck. Both Koron and Bala end up killing themselves during the Russian Roulette. Sergei and Simon go to the back room to check on Baklazhan, but he has freed himself from the ropes and gotten a hold of a gun. He shoots Sergei and wounds him in the stomach. Simon quickly reacts and kills Baklazhan.  The following series of events is an excellent example of black humor within this film. As Sergei lays bleeding on the couch approaching death, Simon is lazily and slowly searching through his phonebook and eventually calls a friend who is a medical student. The friend, clad in punk attire and a colored mohawk, comes over and, after spending an ample amount of time chatting with Simon, takes a hit of cocaine, and pulls out a medical textbook. As his operation begins, it is clear that he has never done this sort of procedure before as he is forced to use the textbook as a guide. While his friend is operating, Simon opens Sergei's leather folder and discovers a thick metal plate inside. He realizes that Sergei was never playing Russian Roulette for real.  After the bloodbath at Koron's apartment, Sergei and Simon decide that they could get better work in the center of Moscow and there was little upside to continuing to work for Sergei Mikhailovich. Deciding to act on an offer from a former colleague from earlier in the movie, Simon and Sergei get out of town taking the heroin with them using it as their "start-up capital".  The film then flashes forward to 2005. The film ends ironically as instead of continuing their lives as thugs like the audience expected, Sergei and Simon have become respected members of the Russian Parliament, or Duma. The duo own a securities trading firm. Sergei Mikhalovich, their old mob boss, now works for them as a security guard.  
The Deal (2005 film)

The next to be killed is Yo who dies of a massive bout of flatulence after the Ninja tampered with steroid suppositories she was taking to maintain her large behind. The voices in Tiffany's head continue to tell her that she had killed them and suspicion falls on Tiffany from the remaining models. On the final day of the shoot, Eva's failed attempts to seduce the asexual photographers results in her abandoning the shoot. She is later found shot along with Gunter. The Ninja confronts Tiffany and Gerd and is unmasked and is Tiffany's boss Merle. Darbie is revealed to be Merle's lesbian lover. Merle and Darbie (whose real name is revealed to be Sarah) had conspired to kill the supermodels to promote the image of a new, intelligent supermodel. Gerd was also in on the scheme to escape from the dominance the mute Gunter to which he is basically a translator. Merle reveals that Tiffany is a major pawn in her scheme. The voices in her head were part of a scheme involving micro transmitters inserted in Tiffany's ears whilst she was having surgery to remove a freckle on her left nipple which Tiffany was concerned would turn cancerous. The voices are provided by Ryan himself (Wee Man) who is another associate of Merle. He is also Dieter, Eva's poolboy. Merle turns the gun on Tiffany, she tries to talk them out of killing anyone else but is shot dead to set her up as the killer. The movie ends with Merle and Sarah/Darbie on the beach, talking about the future, but Merle is then shot (presumably with fatal consequences) by Sarah/Darbie presumably so only she would control the new wave of models.  
Dead Men Walking (film)
 Travis Dee is slaying many zombies, but blood splashes on Travis' face, infecting him. Travis tries to convince the press and police that they were infected with an experimental bio-toxin, and now he is sick from it. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) don't know if he is right or wrong, so he is sentenced to Haywood Maximum Security Prison.  A CDC worker, Samantha Beckett, is sent to the prison to give more information on Travis. Travis and the new inmates arrive at the facility and are put in a line where they are evaluated by [[corrections officer]], Lieutenant Sweeney, telling them that he is "top of the food chain" in the [[prison]]. After noticing Travis coughing heavily and pale, he is sent to the infirmary. Another new arrival, Johnny, is sent to Warden Mahler's office. Mahler tells him not to do anything stupid or make guards angry. His story is the same that Travis had been telling others. The bitten guard dies and Mahler, Sweeney, Dr. Goring, Samantha and Johnny try to determine if the virus is real. Samantha examines Travisâ body and sees that the blood indicates he died at least hours ago, though Sweeney shot him just minutes ago.  Sweeney, Jenkins and Mahler devise a plan to move through the building and gather all the uninfected staff to barricade themselves in the staffroom on the other end of the facility while the guards venture out to kill all infected. He also plans to leave all the uninfected inmates to die, much to Johnnyâs dismay. Johnny is sent back to the cell but on the way he knocks out a guard and takes his gun to run for the outside.  Sweeney, Jenkins, Mahler and Keith head to the officersâ office where Sweeney calls for the National Guard to secure the prison and blockade the entire facility. He stays with his decision to leave the inmates for dead but does tell all of them to stay in their cells.   Sweeney, Mahler, Keith, Jenkins and many other guards make it to the cell blocks to see that all the inmate and staff left have been infected and zombified. As everyone prepares for the zombies to break out of the cells, Sweeney tells Jenkins that when he turns to shoot him. Mahler, realizing Sweeney is infected, leaves the group to protect his son. The zombies on that side start to follow the two as they slip in zombie blood, trying to reach Mahlerâs office. The zombies break out of the cell blocks and run for the guards. They open fire, killing many of them left and right. Seeing that many more are coming, they split up and run inside cells and lock the gates, separating them and keeping firing distance. Samantha meets up with Johnny and they decide to escape together.  After most guards are killed in cells, Jenkins and another guard escape the cell while Sweeney and another stay to fight. Sweeney sees the zombified Mahler and shoots him while stating, âThis is for not giving me a raise my last evaluation!â After going completely crazy from the disease, Sweeney shoots everywhere, accidentally hitting his partner guard. Sweeney leaves through a backdoor and lies down there while the zombies break through and kill the shot guard.  Samantha and Johnny move on. He is bitten and stays behind to give her a chance to leave. She flees and kills Sweeney, now a zombie. In the yard, Jenkins is bitten and she puts him out of his misery. A sniper mistakes Samantha for a zombie and kills her.

Deep Sea Monster Reigo
 In September 1942, Captain Yamagami (Susumu Kurobe) is ordered to rendezvous the Yamato with the [[Combined Fleet]] that is gathering at the Truk Islands (aka Chuuk Islands) in [[Micronesia]], a key strategic point in the South Pacific. With beautiful clear blue skies above and surrounded by coral reefs below, this South Seas paradise became a strong base for the Combined Fleet and the front lines of the naval war; a place where many fierce battles were fought. Decades later, the sea bed surrounding the [[Truk Islands]] is still littered with the remains of more than 60 warships and airplanes.  Among Yamagamiâs crew are the cantankerous Divisional Officer Noboru Osako (Yukijiro Hotaru) and the young [[Ensign]] Takeshi Kaido (Taiyo Sugiura). Unsure of what the future may bring, Kaido went off to war without declaring his intentions for his childhood sweetheart, Chie Kojima (Mai Nanami). He always carries her photo in his coat pocket, while Chie longs for his return to their seaside hometown.  When the Yamato arrives at Truk, the married Osako decides to ease his worries over leaving behind a pregnant wife by sneaking an island woman named Momoka (Yumika Hayashi) aboard ship for some private recreation. But to Osakoâs annoyance, Momoka brings along her elderly grandfather (Mickey Curtis) who insists on telling him a local tale about monsters that has been passed down for generations. The disbelieving naval officer is told that the surrounding waters are home to man-sized, carnivorous Bonefishesâ¦and, as dangerous as the fish are, they are nothing more than an âopening actâ for an even greater menace; the legendary Hell King of the Seas called Reigo.  The next night, a lookout spots a massive shape half-submerged in the distance. Believing it to be an enemy submarine, the Yamato fires on it and scores a direct hit. Osako is shocked when the object emits a strange cry as it sinks beneath the waves. He reports the incident and the story of Reigo to his commander and shipmates. Unbeknownst to the crew, they have killed the offspring of Reigo.  Not long after that first encounter, a school of luminous Bonefish launch themselves from the water like flying fish and attack a group of soldiers standing watch on the Yamatoâs deck. Kaido hears their screams and rushes to the rescue, but finds the men already torn to pieces.  Just as the old man predicted, the Bonefish herald the arrival of Reigo, a beast 80 meters-long and resembling a cross between [[Godzilla]] and a shark. Seething with rage at the murder of its cub, the monster attacks the Combined Fleet with incredible ferocity and awesome destructive power. The naval forces are caught off guard, and Reigo is able to destroy escort ships and damage the Yamato before returning to the ocean depths.  The crew quickly regroups and plans a counterattack, but when Reigo returns it manages to stay one step ahead of the Japanese forces. Almost as if it is aware that the Yamatoâs main guns are long range weapons which are ineffective up close, the monster attacks at close range or blasts the ships from underwater with blue bursts of electricity.  Thoughts of family and lovers back homeâ¦ fear at being confronted by an unknown enemyâ¦conflict and confrontation explode among the officers and crew over the best battle strategy to use against the threat of Reigo.  Over Osakoâs loud objections, Kaido suggests a last-ditch plan of attack that will either stop Reigo or sink the Yamato. Now the stage is set for a final battle to unfold between the worldâs largest battleship and the mysterious dragon-like monster that glides through the seas at will.  Which one will prevailâ¦ Reigo or the battleship Yamato?  
Death Tunnel
 For an initiation stunt, five college women are locked in an abandoned Kentucky hospital.  
Deewane Huye Paagal
   Karan ([[Shahid Kapoor]]) is a shy and nerdy canteen boy and college student, running a cafÃ© with his friend Murugan ([[Johnny Lever]]), and Tanya ([[Rimi Sen]]) is a student in the same college. She is the most popular girl on campus. Karan is in love with Tanya but is too shy to tell her. After he musters some courage and rescues her step-brother from some goons, he catches her attention and is eventually able to invite her to a fake birthday party. On her way there, Tanya witnesses the murder of a scientist, Khurana ([[Om Puri]]) by his evil twin brother, the underworld don Mehboob, and as a result is forced to flee the country to save her own life, since the law had been bought out by the very same killers. The scientist had stored a secret code in a stuffed toy, a parrot, now being sought by Mehboob, and Khurana was able to hide the toy in Tanya's car before being killed. Unawares, Tanya leaves the toy at home before fleeing the country, and the toy is later picked up by Karan, ignorant of Tanya's fate.  Three years later, still in love with Tanya, but depressed by her sudden and complete disappearance, Karan stumbles across old schoolmates of hers at a cafÃ©, and learns from them that she had been living in [[Dubai]] all this time. Karan coaxes Murugan to help him track down Tanya in Dubai. They enlist the aid of a local hustler and bounty hunter, Rocky ([[Akshay Kumar]]).  Rocky travels to Dubai, where his friend Babloo ([[Vijay Raaz]]) has already tracked down Tanya, who has become Natasha, a successful singer and performer. Rocky and Babloo stakeout Natasha's villa to make sure they are on the right track, but as soon as Rocky spots Natasha, it's love at first sight. While he has Natasha under surveillance, Karan and Murugan arrive at the Dubai airport from India. Faced with a potential competitor to woo Natasha, Rocky attempts to eliminate Karan from the picture by lying to him about Tanya. He says that Tanya had taken up drinking and smoking, had had two husbands, six children and also an affair with a gangster, with whom she had a further illegitimate child. He further lies that Tanya had been left wheelchair bound after a drunk driving accident. Karan is heartbroken to hear all this, and decides to go back to Mumbai. He is about to board his flight, when at the last moment, he spots a picture of Tanya as Natasha on a club advertisement printed across an airport Taxi. He is overjoyed, and assumes that Rocky made a mistake, not being aware that Rocky is in fact trying to deceive him.  Things are about to get more complicated, since not only has Rocky to contend with Karan, there are two other people already in her life, trying to catch her in their web of deceit. Local plumber, Sanju Malvani ([[Sunil Shetty]]) has been currying favours for Natasha by pretending to be a paraplegic on crutches. Every time Natasha meets someone she likes, Sanju eliminates the competitor using a unique trick. He edits and prints out a fake newspaper featuring an article showing that person as a crook, and comes over to Natasha and shares "the news" with her while acting all shocked himself, thus earning her admiration. On the other hand, there is Tanya's physically disabled live-in friend Tommy ([[Paresh Rawal]]), who also has a soft spot for her. Having heard of the death of Tanya's disabled brother a year ago, Tommy has since faked being run over in a car accident and now acts like he himself is disabled and mentally challenged, thus managing to stay close to Natasha by seamlessly filling in the void left behind by her deceased brother.  Nonetheless, Rocky begins his attempted seduction of Natasha. Having wired the villa, and thus overheard what Natasha craves in a man, Rocky shows up at the local shopping mall, pretending to be an architect. Natasha, who is shopping at the mall, is ambushed in the parking lot by a bunch of thugs (who it later transpires are simply mugs hired by Rocky himself). Rocky intervenes, and after seemingly beating the living daylights out of the supposed thugs (the scene is similar to Jean-Claude Van Damme's introductory action sequence from Hard Target (1993)), introduces himself to Natasha, and proceeds to show himself off as a charming professional with a heart of gold. Somewhat awed, Natasha offers Rocky an invitation for tea later in the evening, which he accepts.  When Rocky arrives at her villa later in the evening, he is confronted by several obstacles, Natasha's sister Sweety ([[Supriya Pilgaonkar]]), the jealous Tommy and the family's pet dog. Rocky is easily able to charm Sweety, but has to drug the dog, who dies due to an overdose while the sisters are making Rocky a drink in the kitchen. Crisis is avoided when Rocky is able to revive the dog by electrocution using wiring from a lamp in the living room. The parties then quickly depart to the grand opening of Natasha's latest album at a social event, where Rocky now comes face to face with Sanju, who puts Rocky on the spot right away, as he himself is pretending to be an architect!  With Natasha and company under surveillance, Rocky now intercepts Sanju trying to discredit him at Natasha's home. Later, when the shocked Natasha confronts Rocky about him being an alleged impostor, Rocky is able to fast-talk his way out of the situation and convince the gullible Natasha that he is indeed not an architect, but a captain on a ship, something his mother does not approve of, thus the ruse. Tommy, however behaves in a somewhat jealous manner and puts Rocky in a confusing situation, involving him jumping on Rocky's back and then accusing the latter of having twisted and bitten his arm. A food bill from a bar drops out of Tommy's pocket during his supposed accusation. This arouses Rocky's suspicions about his supposed "condition".  The next day using that food bill, Rocky and Babloo track down Tommy at a local disco where, unaware that he is being followed, Tommy shows up every week, for a little fun and dance away from his daily existence as a fake disabled victim. Rocky confronts Tommy while he is on the disco floor and threatens to expose him in front of Natasha. At the end, Rocky lets Tommy go, on the condition that the latter will no longer attempt to get in his way of seducing Natasha.  The scene now shifts to the harbour, where Rocky has invited Natasha over for a cruise. While he is coddling her on the harbour front, Natasha spots Karan and Murugan sitting at the grounds. Unaware that Karan is in Dubai searching for her, she is overjoyed to see an old friend from her past. She introduces Karan to Rocky, unaware that they know each other quite well already! Karan, however, seeing Rocky and Natasha all smiles and happy, simply wants to leave them alone out of his love for Tanya. He just wants her to be happy, even if it is with Rocky and not himself, much to Murugan's frustration. While he tries to leave the scene, pretending that he and Murugan have a flight to catch, Natasha convinces Karan to stay one more night in Dubai, and come over for dinner later in the day.  Sanju shows up later at the party, and pulls Natasha aside to reveal his latest newspaper creation, showing Rocky as an international crook, murderer and serial killer wanted by many crime agencies the world over, whose M.O, as Sanju explains is to trap and seduce innocent girls like Natasha and then destroy their lives. Rocky overhears the conversation and while Natasha is occupied elsewhere, chases Sanju outside in the club parking lot. Sanju drops the pre tense of being crippled, throws his crutches on the ground, and runs for dear life. Later, Rocky, Sanju and Tommy are seen sitting in a bar nearby after a confrontation, exposing each other as fraudsters and having a drink together, cursing their luck at the emergence of Karan as the new love in Natasha'a life.  With Rocky having bugged Natasha again, the trio now listen to Natasha's views about them and find out, in a hilarious manner, that all is not what it seems, since she views Sanju as a brother like figure, Tommy as something similar to her deceased brother, and Rocky as a fraud and murderer. They then go to Natasha's house, where she is having coffee with Karan. Rocky uses a gun to shoot some specially medicated pills into the drawing room to be consumed by the dog. One of them is consumed by the dog, but the other is consumed by Sweety. The effects are hilarious as Sweety suddenly becomes hyperactive and so does the dog. Confusion ensues as the dog attacks Karan and he ends up throwing it out the window.  The next day, Karan goes to Natasha's house to propose to her and finds that she has been sent an anonymous letter, informing her that he indeed had hired Rocky to follow her. In a spate of anger, she sends him out of the house. Later, when he goes to Rocky's house to confront him about this, he finds Sanju and Tommy there as well, who also reveal themselves to have been conning Natasha. Further, Sanju reveals that he had written the anonymous letter to Natasha and goes on to reveal his trick with the newspapers, disgusting Karan. Meanwhile, Mehboob and his family, including Sunny, (his illegitimate son, who has also been obsessed with Tanya since college) arrive at Natasha's house and interrogate her about the stuffed toy. Realising that his father had used his obsession to track down Natasha, Sunny turns on his father and kidnaps her. Sweety informs Sanju about this and he along with Rocky, Karan and Tommy follow them after having gotten directions from Murugan, who happened to see them from a taxi. The chase takes them to the middle of a desert, where after some confusion, it is revealed that Khurana had stored the code of a vault in the stuffed toy. The vault had carried a secret solution, two drops of which could decrease a person's age by 25 years. The night Khurana had died, he had found that his brother wanted to use the formula for his own consumption and had tried to escape in Natasha's car as she had been passing by. He had slipped the toy into a package, a birthday present she had been carrying for Karan's fake birthday dinner, thus explaining how he had the toy. Khurana used the toy to counteract his forgetfulness. Natasha sent him out of the car at first, but, undergoing a change of heart, had gone back later just in time to witness Mehboob's son Baljeet kill Khurana.  Rocky intervenes and cleverly destroys the toy after having it speak the code into Natasha's ear, making sure she cannot be killed, the code being in her mind now. A gunfight ensues, during which Natasha discovers Tommy and Sanju's deceit, much to her shock and disgust. After the commotion, Baljeet, wanting the solution all for himself, to sell to a Chinese buyer and make millions, kidnaps Natasha. Rocky and Sanju follow them on bikes and finally manage to catch up with them. After beating up all the men, they take Natasha to her house where a further argument ensues as to who should be more worthy of Natasha. The argument ends when Karan arrives with Raj Sinha (Aftab Shivdasani) and tells Natasha about Sanju's newspaper scams (which the latter confesses), one of which had exposed Raj as a drug dealer and addict earlier. Raj and Natasha are reunited. Wishing them luck, Karan leaves in sadness after the others are left cursing.  Natasha realises her love for Karan and stops him as he is leaving, saying that she and Raj had had no future ever since their earlier break up. She then accepts and reciprocates his love and they finally unite. This tearful union is once again being witnessed by a grumbling Rocky, Sanju and Tommy along with Sunny. Rocky impatiently tells them to stop cursing and asks them to admit to the fact that they were never worthy enough for her. He then turns to Babloo and suggests, in a whisper, that they try to find out where Karan and Tanya are going for their honeymoon and they eagerly put on a pair of earphones. In the last frame, the camera pans to Tanya and Karan walking away towards the sunset, hand in hand.  At the end, the narrator says that after all the effort he had undertaken to acquire the solution, Mehboob had become too overexcited and had consumed the whole quantity instead of two drops. He had ended up becoming a baby and Sunny unwittingly became his father. The film ends as the narrator requests the audience not to forget him.

The two show each other photographs of their respective daughters. A mutual attraction develops, and the two begin meeting frequently. Ultimately, they decide to consummate their affair and wind up in a seedy hotel. An armed manâlater identified as Philippe LaRocheâbursts into the hotel room, beats Charles, and brutally rapes Lucinda. Charles and Lucinda, not wanting their spouses to learn of the affair, agree not to report the crime. Shortly after, LaRoche contacts Charles, threatens to kill his family, and blackmails him into paying him $20,000. A month later, LaRoche calls again, this time demanding $100,000.  Charles explains his situation to his friend Winston, an ex-con who works as a repairman in his building. Winston agrees to scare off LaRoche for ten percent of the payout. Charles embezzles $10,000 from his company and he and Winston plot to get the drop on LaRoche at his specified meeting location. However, LaRoche surprises them, shoots Winston dead, and takes Winston's payout. Charles disposes of Winston's body and gives a false alibi when he is questioned about the murder by police detective Franklin Church, who also happens to be Winston's close relative. Later, Charles receives a call from LaRoche; he is holding Lucinda hostage and will kill her if he doesn't deliver the $100,000. Charles takes the money from an account meant for his daughter's medical treatment and makes the payoff to LaRoche and his partner Dexter, who works at the motel.  Detective Church questions Charles again after uncovering his friendship with Winston, putting mounting pressure on Charles to come clean about the blackmail. First, he goes to Lucinda's company to warn her and is introduced to the real Lucinda Harris. The woman he met on the train is Jane, a temp who had worked there briefly. He goes to Jane's apartment; it is actually in the process of being rented out. Seeing that Jane's photograph of her daughter was actually a cut out of a stock picture in a brochure, he realizes Jane was in on the scam.  Charles tracks Jane down and sees her kissing LaRoche, and later observes her seducing Sam Griffin, another unsuspecting businessman. He rents a room in the same seedy hotel as before and waits for Jane to ensnare her target and bring Sam to a hotel room. Determined to retrieve his stolen money, Charles knocks LaRoche unconscious outside the hotel room door, disarms him, and reveals to Sam the scheme Jane was about to set him up for. Dexter arrives to back up LaRoche and a gunfight ensues; nearly everyone is fatally shot but Charles, who watches Jane die, returns to his room and convinces the police he is merely a bystander. Before leaving the hotel, Charles claims his briefcase and gets back the money for his daughter's treatments.  Later, Charles' boss Eliot confronts him about the $10,000 he embezzled when he paid Winston. He is arrested for stealing from the company and sentenced to six months of [[community service]], teaching in a prison. During one of his classes, he comes across the story about him written on one of the students papers. The writer instructs him to go to the laundry room. There, Charles finds LaRoche, who survived the gunfight. LaRoche threatens to continue to disrupt Charles' life, but Charles reveals that he has planned the encounter. He stabs LaRoche to death with a [[Shiv (weapon)|shank]] which Winston had given him.  Charles walks away from the encounter by claiming to Detective Church that LaRoche attacked him and he reacted in [[self-defense]]. Church is all but certain LaRoche's death was premeditated murder. However, he has pieced together LaRoche's crimes and is not inclined to seek justice for Winston's killer; instead, he allows Charles to return to his family.

Demon Hunter (film)
  The movie begins in the middle of an exorcism, while demon hunter Jake Greyman waits downstairs in case the exorcism does not end well. It's quickly seen that Jake has a dark personality and is more than human. He is solely focused on killing demons regardless of what he must do to accomplish his task. He is a half-demon working for the church.  A young nun named Sarah assists in the investigation to find a connection between the possessed girls. Upon arriving at the office of a modeling agency Jake and Sarah find a  corpse. While Jake searches through the desk a succubus comes through the dead man to taunt Jake - telling him that he has a different purpose in life and that he should take his rightful place in the world. Jake returns to the Church to inform that the girls were prostitutes and that there was a fourth name on the list.  Jake and Sarah track down the fourth name on the list, finding her to live in a very large house and that she married a wealthy man. Sarah believes the girl, Nancy, is safer because of this though Jake does not. The Demon has summoned Nancy and she leaves in a limo to the cemetery, where the Demon is hiding. Jake and Sarah, staked outside of Nancy's home, follow her there. At the cemetery Nancy leaves flowers at a grave and sees the demon. She informs her guards that the man is an old friend of her husband's and that they are to wait for her because she wants to speak to him in private and she then follows into the crypt where she saw the demon. Despite following Nancy to the cemetery Jake and Sarah are too late; they approach Nancy's guards just in time to find her stumbling back to the group of men in a daze and already showing signs of demonic possession. Jake knows he must kill Nancy before she has a chance to give birth to the demon's child, just as he did with the previous girls. A fight ensues between Jake and Nancy's guards, Nancy flees and Jake yells to Sarah for her to follow. Jake finds Sarah on the ground, alone, and gets angry when he realizes that she can not kill the girl possessed because she sees the women as victims and believes they could have been saved. Jake tells Sarah to return to the convent and walks away, in which she replies that he is a soulless bastard. At this point the demon had witnessed Jake's fight with the guards and his disappointment in Sarah and he calls to Sarah to come to him and to seek comfort with him. Jake interrogates one of Nancy's guards and walks back to the car where Sarah is waiting. Sarah talks Jake into letting her stay with him by claiming while she can't kill the girls or him, if he turns and joins the demons (knowing now that he is half-demon and more susceptible to becoming evil after hearing Nancy refer to him as [[half-breed]]) but that she is willing to die for her convictions and that when Jake goes against this demon she may be the only edge he has.  Jake and Sarah follow a lead down to an abandoned hotel where Nancy may be hiding. The demon is seen snatching a prostitute in the alley of the hotel, he then watches Jake and Sarah enter the building and then lies beside the unconscious prostitute and begins licking her. Inside the hotel Jake and Sarah come across a naked and dying man, he speaks of Nancy who is responsible for his condition and falls back into unconsciousness as Jake and Sarah continue deeper into the hotel now knowing that they are on the right trail. The next scene brings take place at a hotel room where the demon and his succubus are talking about the half breed (Jake) and Sarah. The succubus points out that the demon has become infatuated with Sarah because of her innocence. The succubus wishes to have Jake; she believes he will be a powerful ally. The demon tells her he is too dangerous and that he is to be destroyed. However, the succubus eventually persuades the demon to allow her to have him to enslave his soul and control him. As Jake and Sarah walk the halls of the hotel they come across rooms with various couples having sex. Jake determines the demon they are looking for is Asmodeus, the demon of lust. His power is what draws the prostitutes to the hotel, so he must be somewhere inside.  Jake and Sarah come across Nancy and, after a brief scuffle, Nancy runs off. Jake tells Sarah to wait in the hallway and he goes after Nancy. While searching one of the rooms Jake is confronted by the succubus who attempts to seduce him while Asmodeus shows up in the hallway where Sarah is waiting. Asmodeus once again calls for Sarah to follow him. She does but with her weapons ready for use against him. Sarah is assaulted in the hallway by Nancy, but uses her cross to burn Nancy and she then flees with Sarah chasing after her. Jake is seen rolling on the floor and kissing the succubus, which brings him closer to his cross and distracts the succubus enough for him to grab the weapon and kill her. Nancy is found by Sarah and after Nancy attempts to pounce Sarah shoots her with a gun in an attempt to slow her down to kill her but Asmodeus appears to Sarah following the shots which were also heard by Jake. Sarah shoots at Asmodeus but the bullets do nothing to him and the gun runs out of bullets. Asmodeus knocks Sarah out just before Jake shows up. Jake and Asmodeus fight. Jakes loses but Asmodeus does not kill him - claiming it doesn't matter to him whether Jakes lives or dies because in the end his soul will belong to him.  Jake awakes in the morning to find Sarah gone. He steals a motorcycle after breaking the arm of the biker. He rides back to the cemetery where Asmodeus seduces his other victims, and where he has brought Sarah. While Asmodeus begins to have [[sex]] with Sarah she transforms into a demon and kills him. Jake hears the growls of a demon and rushes into the crypt to see Sarah, as a demon, devouring the heart of Asmodeus. Sarah explains to Jake that he is not the only half breed to have been born and to have his dark side restricted by the church. Jake and Sarah fight after she refuses to play for the side of God any longer and is unable to convince Jake to do the same. Jake strangles Sarah and then walks out of the crypt seeming to be genuinely distraught over having to kill her. Jake goes to the church and confronts the Cardinal, angry and demanding why he wasn't told that Sarah was a half breed. He tells Jake that it was best if no one knew and that Sarah didn't know herself and while they had hoped Jake would kill the demon before he could get to Sarah, which they knew would bring out the demon in her, it wasn't a terrible loss that she is now dead. The movie ends with seeing the prostitute Asmodeus had snatched in the alley of the hotel now possessed with his child and then the camera pans up to see Jake dropping down from a fire escape to kill the prostitute.

The Descent
 On her way back from whitewater rafting with her friends, Juno ([[Natalie Mendoza]]), along with Beth ([[Alex Reid (actress)|Alex Reid]]), Sarah ([[Shauna Macdonald]]), Sarah's husband Paul ([[Oliver Milburn]]), and their daughter Jessica (Molly Kayll) get involved in a car accident when Paul is distracted. Paul and Jessica are killed, but Sarah survives.  One year later, Sarah and her friends Juno, Beth, Sam ([[MyAnna Buring]]), Rebecca ([[Saskia Mulder]]), and newcomer Holly ([[Nora-Jane Noone]]) are reunited at a cabin in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of [[North Carolina]] for a spelunking (caving) adventure. The next day, they hike up to a cave entrance and descend. While in the cave, Juno apologises to Sarah for not being there for her after the accident, but Sarah is distant.  After the group moves through a narrow passage, it collapses behind them, trapping them. After a heated discussion, Juno admits that she has led the group into an unknown cave system instead of the fully explored cave system that they had originally planned to visit, and that rescue is, therefore, impossible. She then tells Sarah that she led them into the unknown cave in the hopes of restoring their relationship, but Sarah rebuffs her.  As the group presses forward with hopes of finding an exit, they discover climbing equipment from a previous caver and a cave painting that suggests an exit exists. Holly, thinking she sees sunlight, runs ahead, but falls down a hole and breaks her leg. As the others help Holly, Sarah wanders off and observes a pale, humanoid creature drinking at a pool before it scampers away. Later, the group comes across a den of animal bones and are suddenly attacked by the creature (called a "crawler" in the credits). Holly is killed: her neck ripped out before her body is dragged away. Sarah runs, falls down a hole,  and is knocked unconscious. Juno, trying to prevent Holly's body from being dragged away, kills a crawler with her pickaxe and then, startled, accidentally stabs Beth through the neck. Beth collapses with Juno's pendant in her hand, and a traumatized Juno flees while Beth begs her not to leave her.  Sarah awakens to find herself in a den of human and animal carcasses, and witnesses Holly's body being eaten by a group of crawlers. Juno discovers markings pointing to a specific path through the caves. After regrouping with Sam and Rebecca, and realizing the crawlers' use of sound to hunt, Juno tells them the markings she discovered may point to the way out, but she will not leave without Sarah.  Meanwhile, Sarah encounters Beth, who tells Sarah that Juno wounded and abandoned her. Beth also gives her Juno's pendant, which Sarah recognizes as a gift from Paul, realizing that Juno had an affair with Paul before his death.  In pain and not wanting to be eaten by the crawlers, Beth begs Sarah to [[euthanasia|euthanize]] her. Sarah reluctantly does so by bashing her head in with a rock.  Sarah then encounters a family of crawlers but manages to kill them all, becoming covered in blood in the process. Afterward, she has a psychotic breakdown.  Elsewhere, Juno, Sam, and Rebecca are pursued by a large group of crawlers. When they reach a chasm, Sam tries to climb across but encounters a crawler scaling the ceiling. It rips her throat out,  but Sam stabs it before she bleeds to death in front of Juno and Rebecca. Rebecca is then dragged back and eaten alive as Juno escapes.  Juno encounters Sarah and lies to her about seeing Beth die. After defeating a group of crawlers, Sarah confronts Juno, revealing that she knows Juno had wounded Beth and left her for dead, and about the affair. She then strikes Juno in the leg with a pickaxe and leaves her to die as a swarm of crawlers approaches. Juno is last heard screaming as Sarah escapes.  Sarah falls down a hole and is knocked unconscious. She awakens, manages to escape from the cave, runs to her vehicle, and speeds off. She pulls over to the side of the road and breaks down in tears. After a truck passes her, she opens the window, leans out and vomits. Upon re-entering the car, she sees a hallucination of Juno sitting next to her and screams before the screen cuts to black.  === Original UK Ending === In the UK releases of the film, Sarah wakes up in the cave after seeing Juno, revealing she was dreaming the escape. She then sees a vision of Jessica's birthday cake, which is just her torch. The camera slowly backs out as the crawlers are heard closing in on Sarah as the movie cuts to the credits.  This part of the ending was cut out because it was thought it was too dark for US audiences.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435625/alternateversions?ref_=ttgf_sa_4</ref>

 [[Gigolo]]s in Europe are being terrorized by a serial killer. In [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], Deuce Bigalow's wife Kate has died from a shark attack, and Deuce is invited by his former [[pimp]] T.J. Hicks to [[Amsterdam]]. Deuce goes to take his mind off of Kate.  After T.J. shows Deuce his boat, or "float crib," the pair go to a coffee shop where they get high and bump into Heinz Hummer, a German gigolo. After leaving the coffee shop, Deuce finds Hummer dead in an alley, but thinks he is merely stoned and takes the dead gigolo to T.J.'s float crib; when T.J. gets back, he immediately realizes that Hummer is dead. T.J. plans to dump the body, but skeptical of Hummer's reputation of being well-endowed, unzips his pants and examines his [[genitalia]] and is caught by a tour boat.  Upon his release from the police station, Deuce finds T.J. at a restaurant and recalls that he saw the killer walking away from Hummer's body. Deuce says it was a woman, so they both figure it was a she-john, a former client of the murdered gigolo. T.J. convinces Deuce to find the killer by becoming a gigolo again, visiting the former clients and "rooting" out the killer. They attend a meeting of the Royal Order of European Man Whores, but fail to procure a list of the clients.  Deuce and T.J. visit the first client on the list. While Deuce distracts the woman, T.J. breaks into her residence and finds a brand of lipstick which might be the kind found on all the victims. After leaving, Deuce finds Gaspar on the street and shows him the lipstick. Gaspar throws the lipstick in the trash, mentioning that the lipstick found on the victims "is a very rare one: Lavender Love #66". As Gaspar enters the police station, his niece, Eva, approaches him and gives him his lunch. Eva slaps herself three times when Gaspar sneezes. Deuce helps her pick up the things she dropped, and Eva explains to Deuce that she has [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]. Deuce sees that she has a painting of a fish, so they go to the Amsterdam aquarium together. Deuce continues to investigate different women from Antoine's book.  Deuce rides with Gaspar to the Man-Whore Awards Ceremony under the guise of protecting the man-whores. Gaspar pulls a gun on Deuce and tells him that he was once a man-whore hopeful. While Gaspar was observing a demonstration on how to perform a certain sex act, one of his classmates offered to let him use his penis-enlargement pump. When the demonstration ended, Gaspar was horrified the demonstration was his [[Engagement|fiancÃ©e]]. Gaspar was so angry and shocked that he continued to pump until his penis exploded, causing the other men to laugh at him. He blames man-whores for the loss of his fiancÃ©e and his penis, and plans to kill them all at their awards ceremony.  At the ceremony, Deuce evacuates the building and gets into a sword fight with Gaspar, during which he mentions the other romantic ways of pleasing a woman; his words move the ladies in the crowd and the male gigolos. Gaspar beats Deuce, but before he can detonate the bomb, the woman with a penis for a nose and the woman with the tracheotomy distract Gaspar. Deuce knocks out Gaspar with a trophy taking the bomb detonator. For his bravery, Deuce is given the Golden Boner award. He shares a passionate kiss with Eva, and accidentally sets off the bomb when the statue's penis bumps the detonator button. Deuce and Eva leave the scene. The following day, Deuce and Eva come to pick up T.J., who has been released from jail, and tells them that he is entering a brand new prostitution market: gay man-whoring.  In an epilogue: T.J. stops gay man-whoring and becomes a rapper.  Deuce and Eva got married with Eva being pregnant.  Gaspar is gang raped in prison, and Kate's prosthetic leg is turned into a [[bong]] by a woman without a leg.  
Detective Conan: Strategy Above the Depths
 The 9th annual Detective Conan movie sets sail on a 100 million yen luxurious [[Cruising (maritime)|cruise]]. Fifteen years ago, a cruise named ''[[Yashiromaru]]'', built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the [[Saint]] [[Aphrodite]], was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogoro shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited. All passengers were evacuated, but Ran returned to her hiding place during the hide-and-seek game to find a "gold medal" made by sea-shells the Detective Boys made for her. However, as the ship swayed, she fainted in the enclosed area.  It turns out Akiyoshi was the main murderer after all, and she was the one who did all three killings and made Kusaka think that he did them himself. She also revealed that her father was the [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] who died while the cruise ship sank. Kogoro, however, deduced correctly this time and managed to arrest Akiyoshi. He was originally trying to find evidence to prove her innocence because of her strong resemblance to his wife, but the more investigation he does, the more guilty she became. As Kogorou and Conan began to evacuate, they found out that Ran was missing. They find her under the deck of the boat with the help of a fire axe. Afterwards a helicopter comes and picks them up. At the post credits, Conan explained he knew where Ran was because when he kicked the volleyball, Ran said she heard a soccer ball, meaning she was in a place with a tough wall. The detective kids come, and told Ran they made a better "gold medal" for her, and put it on her.

The family arm themselves and fire on the officers. Rufus is killed and Mother Firefly is taken into custody, while Otis and Baby escape. They steal a car, and after killing the driver, they go to Kahiki Palms, a run-down motel.  While at the motel, Otis and Baby take a band called Banjo and Sullivan hostage in their room, and Otis shoots the roadie when he returns. Meanwhile, Baby's father, Captain Spaulding, decides to rendezvous with Baby and Otis. En route, his truck runs out of gas, and he frightens a child and assaults the boy's mother before stealing her car. Back at the motel, Otis rapes Roy's wife Gloria and demands Adam and Roy come with him on an errand.  Otis drives his two prisoners to a place where he buried weapons. While walking to the location, the two prisoners attack Otis, but he bludgeons Roy and cuts Adam's face off. Back at the motel, Adam's wife Wendy tries to escape out the bathroom window. When Gloria attempts to rebel, Baby kills her. Wendy runs out of the motel, but is caught by Captain Spaulding, who knocks her unconscious. Otis returns, and all three leave the motel together in the band's van.  The motel maid comes to clean the room, and discovers the murder scene. The maid enters the bathroom, where she sees "The Devil's Rejects" written on the wall in blood, and is startled by Wendy, who is accidentally killed when she runs out to the highway to seek help while she was in shock. Wydell calls a pair of amoral bounty hunters â the "Unholy Two" â Rondo and Billy Ray, to help him find the Fireflys. While investigating, they discover an associate of Spaulding's named Charlie Altamont. Wydell begins to lose sanity when Mother Firefly reveals that she murdered his brother. After having a dream in which his brother commands him to avenge his death, Wydell stabs Mother Firefly to death. The surviving Fireflys gather at a brothel owned by Charlie, where he offers them shelter from the police.  After he leaves the brothel, Wydell threatens Charlie to give up the Fireflys. With the help of the "Unholy Two", the sheriff takes the family back to the Firefly house where he tortures them, using similar methods they used on their own victims. He nails Otis' hands to his chair, and staples crime scene photographs to Otis's and Baby's stomachs, then beats and shocks Captain Spaulding and Otis with a cattle prod, and taunts Baby about the death of her mother.  Wydell sets the house on fire and leaves Otis and Spaulding to burn, but lets Baby loose outside so he can hunt her for sport. Charlie returns to save the Firefly family, but is killed by Wydell. Baby gets shot in the calf of her left leg, brutally horse-whipped, and then strangled by Wydell. Tiny suddenly arrives and intervenes, killing Wydell, and saving the Firefly family. Otis, Baby, and Spaulding escape in Charlie's 1972 [[Cadillac Eldorado]], leaving behind Tiny, who walks back into the burning house. The trio drives, badly injured and seemingly humbled by their experience with a clearer understanding of the torment and anguish that they had put their past victims through. As Otis drives down the road with Baby and Spaulding asleep in the back seat he notices a police barricade ahead of them. Realizing that they will not make it out alive, he wakes Baby and Spaulding, hands them each a gun and they speed towards police barricade. As they speed down the road, they fire on the police officers who then return fire and all three are [[Suicide by cop|shot to death by the police]].

She is interviewed by criminal psychologist Taryn Mills and tells her everything she knows about the case. Domino explains her profession and the events leading up to the theft with Mills occasionally prompting her to give more detail.  Domino is a former model living in Los Angeles who becomes a bounty hunter when, after being kicked out of college, she notices a newspaper advertisement for a bounty hunter training seminar. Her colleagues are Ed Moseby, Choco and Afghan driver Alf. They are employed by Claremont Williams III, a [[bail bondsman]] who also runs an [[Armored car (valuables)|armored car]] business, and whose [[mistress (lover)|mistress]], Lateesha Rodriguez, works for the California [[Department of Motor Vehicles]]. Her granddaughter Mica is suffering from a blood disease and needs an operation that costs $300,000. Claremont sets up the robbery of $10 million from Drake Bishop, the owner of the [[Stratosphere Las Vegas|Stratosphere Hotel and Casino]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and a client of Claremont. His bounty hunters would return the stolen money and collect a $300,000 finder's fee from Bishop.  Lateesha has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket at the DMV. A teenager named Frances arrives at the DMV and asks Lateesha for fake licenses for himself, his brother, and two of their friends. The FBI are tipped about Lateesha's racket. They threaten to send her to jail unless she gives them information about Frances, whom they have been surveilling. Lateesha throws them off the trail by saying that Frances, his brother and his two friends are going to commit the robbery, when in reality she and Claremont are doing it themselves.  Lateesha carries out the robbery with the help of three co-workers. Claremont finds that Frances and his brother are the sons of mafia boss Anthony Cigliutti. He phones Lateesha and tells her to abort the plan, leaving the money with [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]] Locus Fender, who takes the money to his mother's trailer home. Claremont has the bounty hunters apprehend Frances, his brother and his two friends and then tells them to deliver them to men working for Drake Bishop. Claremont tells them to retrieve the money from Fender and to deliver it to Bishop at the Stratosphere Casino. Following a shootout with Fender's mother, the money is retrieved. Cigliutti is told about his sons' arrest and is led to believe that Bishop had his sons killed. In reality Bishop's men released them on finding that they did not know anything about the robbery. Believing his sons dead, Cigliutti wants revenge and heads for the Stratosphere. In Las Vegas, Domino takes $300,000 of Bishop's money and gives it to Lateesha for Mica's operation.  At the Stratosphere, the bounty hunters meet with Bishop, who has an armed crew with him. Domino and Bishop discuss the money and what should happen next. Alf has stolen the money and filled the sacks with plastic explosives. He then reveals that he has the remote detonator taped to his hand, and has shipped the money to aid freedom fighters in Afghanistan. Shortly after this revelation Cigliutti turns up with his crew. Though Bishop denies he had Cigliutti's sons killed, Cigliutti shoots him. In the ensuing gunfight Choco and Ed are severely wounded, but make it into the elevator with Domino. Alf blows up the top of the Stratosphere and Domino is the only survivor.  After telling Taryn Mills everything, Domino is released by the FBI. Mills advises her to retire from bounty hunting. The money in boxes is delivered to Afghanistan and opened by celebrating children in the streets, Mica gets her operation, and Domino shares a moment with her mother.  
Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist
     In 1944, a Nazi [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] lieutenant named Kessel forces the parish priest of a small village in [[Netherlands in World War II|occupied Holland]], Father [[Lankester Merrin]] ([[Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd]]), to participate in arbitrary executions in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper in exchange for sparing the village.  In 1947, Merrin, whose faith was shattered by the incident, is an archaeologist in Derati, a remote area in the [[Turkana region]] of [[British Kenya]] excavating a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] church built around the 5th century â long before Christianity had reached that region of Africa. He meets up with Father Francis ([[Gabriel Mann]]), a [[Maryknoll]] missionary appointed to ensure the church is not desecrated, and Major Granville ([[Julian Wadham]]), the British military officer overseeing the dig.  Making their way to Derati with Chuma (Andrew French), Merrin's translator and guide, Merrin introduces Francis to Rachel ([[Clara Bellar]]), a doctor who spent time in a [[concentration camp]] and is haunted by her experiences there, and Emekwi (Eddie Osei), an enthusiastic convert who provides accommodation for the two men. Merrin takes Francis on a tour of the dig site. Astonishingly, the church is in perfect condition, as though it had been deliberately buried immediately after its construction was completed.  On the site, Merrin meets a shy, physically-deformed young boy named Cheche ([[Billy Crawford]]), shunned and mistreated by the locals for fear that he is cursed. Although dissuaded by Chuma, Merrin attempts to make contact with Cheche, finally managing to bring the boy to Rachel for medical treatment.  Once the door is uncovered, Merrin, Francis, and Chuma go inside the church. Francis notices that this particular church is built in such a way as to restrain something beneath it. A hidden passageway leads them to a crypt containing a demonic idol - an ancient sanctuary where human sacrifice was performed. Merrin deduces that the church was built, not as a place of worship, but to seal this underground temple. On their way back, they find corpses of hyenas (who have appeared out of season) being eaten by a herd of cattle. The Turkana elders, thinking the church is evil, demand Merrin stop digging.  Francis contacts Granville to send a detachment to guard the dig from potential robbers, despite Merrin's objections. Two British soldiers attempting to loot some precious stones from the church are then found dead the next day (one was [[John the Baptist|beheaded]]; the other [[Crucifixion|crucified]] to the altar [[Saint Peter|head downward]]). Despite the Christian symbolism used in the murders and the testimony of Jomo ([[Israel Aduramo]]), a Turkana warrior who had long been keeping a wary eye on the site, that the two men were affected by a strange madness that caused them to kill each other, Granville, blaming the Turkana, goes to town in a fit of rage demanding the purported culprits be given up, shooting a young woman in cold blood when the locals protest. The town is then placed under military surveillance.  Determined to stop the 'Christian evil' from spreading, Jomo breaks into the mission school and slaughters Francis' students - Emekwi's two sons - before he is shot on the spot by British soldiers. Emekwi bitterly questions if this is how God rewards those who keep faith with him.  Francis has a disturbing realization that Cheche's unusual recovery is not caused by God, as he had thought. Fearing for Cheche's soul, he considers [[Baptism|baptising]] him; the boy accepts on the condition it be held at the church. Meanwhile, a guilt-ridden and despairing Granville commits suicide by shooting himself in the mouth.  The Turkana elders (via Chuma) demand that the church be reburied and Francis - who they hold responsible for the spread of the 'Christian evil' and the arrival of the British troops - and Cheche be handed over to them to be killed; when their demands are turned down, war between the two sides become inevitable.  Francis, assisted by Rachel, begins to baptise Cheche at the church; as they do so, however, the demon controlling Cheche assaults them. Realising an exorcism is in order, Francis leaves quickly to fetch his copy of the [[Roman Ritual]]. The demon removes Cheche's deformities and transforms him into a hairless, androgynous 'perfect' being; an earthquake erupts and seals off the entrance to the church. The Sergeant-Major ([[Ralph Brown]]),  Granville's second-in-command who had assumed control of the troops after the latter's death, postpones Merrin's requests to clear the entrance for daybreak.  The next morning, Merrin and the British find Francis [[Saint Sebastian|tied to a tree naked, shot with arrows]]. Taken back to the hospital to be looked after by Emekwi's wife, the dying Francis reveals to Merrin that Cheche is possessed and begs him to perform an exorcism. Another earthquake shifts the rocks, unblocking the church entrance just enough to allow Merrin to go inside. At the underground temple, Merrin finds Rachel â who runs away under a trance â and the possessed Cheche. Merrin rushes back to the infirmary to wear Francis' vestments, and goes back to the church to begin the exorcism. The demon offers Merrin a chance to rewrite his past, at which Merrin (in a hallucination) finds himself back in 1944 Holland: when he refuses to cooperate, Kessel instead has Merrin ''and'' all the villagers killed for his defiance.  When Merrin comes back to his senses, the demon mocks the futility of his attempt to change what happened. As Merrin recommences the exorcism, a supernatural [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] appears in the sky, the entranced Rachel attempts to kill herself, Emekwi violently beats his wife and the Turkana charge to battle. Despite the evil spirit's resistance, the exorcism succeeds. Cheche regresses to his former condition as the demon leaves his body and enters that of a hyena.  With the demon driven out of Derati, life returns to normal and the British detachment leave. One of the local elders, however, warns that the demon will pursue Merrin. Bidding farewell to Rachel and Cheche, now serving as Rachel's assistant at the infirmary, Merrin, who has regained his faith and is an active priest once more, leaves for Rome.

Following a distress call sent by Dr. Carmack, a group of [[marines]], led by Sarge, is sent on a search-and-rescue mission to Mars while overseen by Marcus "Pinky" Pinzerowski. One of the marines, John "Reaper" Grimm, accompanies his sister, Dr. Samantha Grimm, to one of the labs within the devastated sector to retrieve data and he learns that the dig site, where their parents were accidentally killed, was reopened and ancient skeletons of a genetically enhanced [[humanoid]] race were discovered. The team uses a portal to get to Mars.  While searching for survivors in the facility, the marines find a traumatized and injured Dr. Carmack and escort him to the medical lab for treatment, but he later disappears.

She and Duke also witness Goat resurrecting and killing himself by smashing his head against a reinforced window.

The creatures use the portal and slaughter and mutate most of the research staff into abominations as well. This leads to Sarge ordering his team to sanitize the entire facility. Kid returns with a scared Pinky, but when he informs Sarge that he didn't execute a group of survivors he found and refuses to go back and do so Sarge executes the Kid for insubordination, leading to a standoff taking place.

He  takes her on a date, and the trio get something to eat. Later that night, they go on their "real" date, dancing and meeting up with Tobe's friends for another party, where Harlan takes drugs under the influence of Tobe. She returns home the next day; as she has returned home long after she was expected, Wade, her father, becomes enraged, and she retreats to her room. When she refuses to talk, he pounds on the door and leaves visible damage.  Tobe continues to see Harlan.  Her father's rage increases, and he shatters her bedroom window.  The romantically involved couple ride a horse that supposedly belongs to one of Harlan's friends named Charlie.  Upon returning, Charlie claims he has never met Harlan and that the horse was stolen.

The cousins' primary mode of transportation is an orange 1969 [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]] that the boys affectionately refer to as the "[[General Lee (car)|General Lee]]". Along the way, the family is tormented by corrupt Hazzard County Commissioner [[Boss Hogg|Jefferson Davis Hogg]], widely known as "Boss Hogg" ([[Burt Reynolds]]), and his willing but dimwitted [[henchman]], [[Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane]] ([[M. C. Gainey]]).  After Rosco has the General Lee impounded after Bo and Lukeâs attempt to run away from a daughter of one their many moonshine customers, Billy Prickett ([[James Roday]]), a famous stock-car driver, enters Hazzard to participate in the rally. Meanwhile, Rosco plants a fake moonshine still ("'cause he's too dumb to find the real one") in Uncle Jesse's barn and seizes the Duke property in the interest of [[eminent domain]] for Boss Hogg, forcing the family to temporarily reside with neighbor and Uncle Jesse's love-interest, Pauline ([[Lynda Carter]]). Pauline informs the Dukes that Rosco seized another farm on charges, so Bo and Luke investigate a local construction site and find geologic core samples with the help of bait-shop owner Sheev ([[Kevin Heffernan (actor)|Kevin Heffernan]]). Meanwhile, Coltrane makes arrangements to seize the General Lee as "evidence" from the local auto body shop run by the Dukes' friend Cooter Davenport ([[David Koechner]]), who instead turns the car into a hot rod and applies a new paint job and horn, in return for finally getting payment for all the work he has done ("...'cause that's how this works...") for the boys in the past.  [[Image:Dukes-of-hazzard-sheriff-car.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sheriff's car at location in Thousand Oaks, California]] After retrieving the General Lee before Rosco can, the Dukes go to Atlanta to visit a local university geology lab, meeting with Katie-Lynn Johnson ([[Nikki Griffin]]), a Hazzard county girl and the Dukes' love interest, and her Australian roommate Annette ([[Jacqui Maxwell]]). At the lab, they discover Boss Hogg's intentions of turning the county into a strip coal mine. They are later arrested by [[Atlanta Police Department|Atlanta Police]] after running from campus police. Back in Hazzard, Daisy learns, with the help of Sheriff's Deputy Enos Strate ([[Michael Weston]]), that Billy Prickett has been hired by Boss Hogg to participate in the rally as a ringer.  Boss Hogg then heads to Atlanta, where he informs the Duke boys, in lock-up, that they are too late to stop him and reveals that the vote on Hogg's proposition is at the same time as the rally, explaining Billy Prickett's involvement. During a transfer from detainment, Daisy helps the boys escape from the patrol car, and they speed home to try to inform the townsfolk, escaping Atlanta Police, and the [[Georgia State Patrol]] after Bo outmaneuvers the city cops.  Upon returning home, the Dukes discover that Boss Hogg and Rosco had taken Uncle Jesse and Pauline hostage, an obvious trap for the boys, and that Billy is in on the scheme because he is ashamed of the town's low status. The two race to the farmhouse to cause a distraction to the waiting Hazzard County sheriff's deputies and Georgia state troopers, while Daisy and Cooter rescue Jesse and Pauline. Meanwhile, the college girls head to the rally with Sheev to inform the townsfolk about the vote on the strip-mining ordinance. Because of Sheev's armadillo hat and lack of pants, no one listens, so Bo leaves for the rally while Luke and Jesse team up to foil the county and state police who are chasing Bo, interfering with the race. Upon crossing the finish line first, before Billy, the two continue racing back and forth all the way into town, leading the townsfolk to the courthouse just in time to vote against Boss Hogg's proposed ordinance. At the courthouse, Daisy takes advantage of the governor of Georgia's presence and TV cameras to convince him to pardoning the boys, so Uncle Jesse takes the opportunity to knock out Boss Hogg and gets a pardon for assaulting a county commissioner at the same time.  The final scene shows a cook-out at the Dukes' house where Pauline convinces Uncle Jesse, who could not be found because he was "using the meat smoker", to get up and play the [[Theme from "The Dukes of Hazzard" (Good Ol' Boys)|television series' main theme]]. Bo and Luke are romantically involved with the girls in the General Lee when they are caught by Luke's other love-interest Laurie Pullman ([[Alice Greczyn]]) from the introduction of the film, who proceeds to chase them with a shotgun as they drive away.  During the credits, outtakes from the production of the film are shown.  
Duma (2005 film)
 Set in the country of [[South Africa]], the story begins with a [[cheetah]] cub being orphaned after his mother was killed by lions. The cub is found on the side of the road by a young boy named Xan ([[Alexander Michaeletos]]) and his father Peter ([[Campbell Scott]]). Initially reluctant to take in a wild animal, Peter agrees to let Xan take care of the cub. They name him âDumaâ, the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] name for âcheetahâ. Over the years, Duma becomes a part of the family, being closely raised by Xan. As he nears adulthood, Peter and Xan decide to teach Duma how to run by having him chase alongside Peterâs motorcycle, which can barely keep up with him. But with Duma almost fully grown, to Xanâs dismay, his father tells him that it is time to take his friend to his real home before he grows too old to survive in his native habitat. His father says to Xan, âDuma has to live the life he was born toâor heâll never be fully alive.â  Xan reluctantly agrees, but their plans must be put on hold when his father suddenly falls ill and dies and Xan and his mother ([[Hope Davis]]) must move to Johannesburg. Duma comes with them, which wreaks havoc on their life in the city. Xanâs aunt is terrified of Duma, who likes to sneak up and surprise her, and when Duma escapes and pays a disastrous visit to Xanâs school, the two of them must flee the city to keep Duma from being put into captivity. Not knowing where to go, Xan gets an ideaâheâll carry out the plan his dad had outlined, taking Duma home in the neighbouring country of [[Botswana]], over the scorching [[Makgadikgadi Pan|Makgadikgadi Salt Pans]], through the [[Okavango Delta]] and into the Erongo Mountains.  Xan begins to drive to his destination in his fatherâs old motorcycle, with Duma in the [[sidecar]]. After running out of fuel and water in the grasslands, they find some shade underneath a crashed airplane. There, they are confronted by Ripkuna ([[Eamonn Walker]]), a mysterious drifter on a journey of his own. While Xan isnât at all that sure he can trust Rip, he agrees to go with him. Xan manages to turn the immobile motorcycle into a [[Land sailing|desert sailboat]] out of a parachute from the plane wreck, and Xan, Rip and Duma are on their way again, until they encounter the untraversable [[Shrubland|scrub brush]] of the [[Kalahari Desert]] and must abandon the motorcycle. While trying to find shelter, Rip is trapped in an abandoned diamond mine by a cave in, and Xan decides to leave him, as he suspects that he has been leading him to town instead of the jungle to sell Duma and collect a reward for finding him. However, when Duma is caught in a trap and Xan is knocked unconscious by a boar, Rip rescues both of them, having escaped the mine through a ventilation shaft.  Soon, they reach the [[Okavango Delta]], where Xan is attacked by the deadly wildlife and the churning rapids of the [[Thamalakane River]], but itâs too late for him to turn back now. Xan, Rip and Duma press through the [[Okavango Basin|Okavango]], and finally the Erongo Mountains, on the border of [[Botswana]] and [[Namibia]] are in sight. However, once they get there, Xan is suddenly set upon by a swarm of [[tsetse fly|tsetse flies]]. To protect him from their lethal bite, Rip huddles over Xan and is bitten by hundreds of flies. He soon develops [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], and Xan takes him to a nearby village where he can be cared for. Later that night, outside the village, Duma is out on his own and starts calling out into the mountains. Duma finds another cheetah calling to him, and they bond rather quickly. It is never explained whether this is another male cheetah, or is in fact one of Duma's siblings. Xan hears this activity, and realizes that this is where he and Duma must part. Xan says goodbye to Duma, and Duma comes to Xan and says a final goodbye, and goes back to play with his new friend. Then Xan goes back to the village to Rip. Before the credits, it shows Xan being reunited with his mother and the film ends.  
Dus
  In the opening scene, Siddhant Dheer ([[Sanjay Dutt]]), the head of the Anti-Terrorist Cell (a fictitious organisation), narrates how rampant terrorism has become in the world and goes on to tell the story of 7 of the hardest days in his life.  The ATC has a tip off about an impending terrorist attack on 10 May, targeting 20â25 thousand people. The man behind the plan is one Jamwaal, a [[Keyser SÃ¶ze]] who is feared by politics and the law alike. The only piece of information, known about the impending attack is the codeword "JEET". Siddhant starts an unofficial investigation against Jamwaal. A goon named Altaf is arrested in connection to the case after the ATC defuse a bomb threat at a building.  Later, a woman is shot dead at her own home by an unknown assailant. Siddhant gets a tip from Neha ([[Esha Deol]]), an undercover officer stationed by him in Canada, that an aide of Jamwaal named Himmat Mehendi has been arrested by the Canadian police. He sends his brother Shashank ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]) and his partner, Aditya ([[Zayed Khan]]) to grab Himmat, take him to a safe location pointed out by Neha and extract information from him about Jamwaal. After attending his sister Anu's ([[Diya Mirza]]) engagement, Shashank and Aditya head to Canada on the same day. At the same time, Anu and her husband are kidnapped in lieu of Altaaf's release. Siddhant, then realises that there is a terrorist informer in the ATC itself.  Meanwhile, in Canada, Aditya and Shashank are caught in a tense situation when Aditya realises that the car they are travelling in has a bomb. Being a specialist at defusing bombs, he asks Shashank to drive fast as reducing the speed would detonate it. A local police officer named Dan ([[Sunil Shetty]]) is meeting his wife, trying to convince her to return to him after an incident that killed their baby while she was still pregnant, when he sees them driving at top speed. He goes on to pursue them, resulting in a high speed car chase which ultimately culminates in Aditya and Shashank jumping off the car as it travels a bridge, causing it to slow down and explode. They then meet Neha, who reveals that she had planted the bomb in their car (having asked them by phone to get into it in the first place), calling it a test. The two go to her house and later manage to kidnap Himmat, who, at first, claims to them that he is "JD". Dan sees them again and now chases them to another bridge, where he roughly interrogates them, all the while refusing to believe who they really are. However, a hit squad appears on the bridge and attacks them. One of their bullets hits Dan on the shoulder while Aditya and Shashank react quickly enough to save his life and kill the men. Later, in custody Himmat breaks down and tells them that everybody working for Jamwaal is a pawn who doesn't know his identity. It is here that Dan teams up with them in return for their saving his life and the trio move to his house.  While Himmat claims that he does not know anything else, the quartet realise that Himmat is too scared of Jamwaal to be revealing sensitive information about him.  They then stage an attempt on Himmat's life and a scared Himmat informs them that the only people who pose any real danger to Jamwaal are Asif and Irfan, his once friends turned foes, who betrayed him to foil his plan for the 10th of May. Himmat tells them that he knows where Asif might be.  The quartet turn up at a disco, Asif's supposed hideout, with Himmat and question him. Asif merely gives them Irfan's whereabouts and commits suicide. The then confront Irfan, believing him to be Jamwaal, and after killing his goons, kill him too. In India, Siddhant prepares a trap to rescue Anu. Anu's husband dies, but Anu is saved and the mole, Roy, is detained and commits suicide instead of suffering the indignity of going to prison, but not before revealing the codeword for the entire operation, "JEET". An enraged Siddhant learns from Altaf that the latter had been hired by Jamwaal to kill Asif and Irfan in Canada before the 10th. Siddhant decides to go to Canada, while his colleague and love interest, Aditi (Shilpa Shetty) decides to use Altaf as a bait to track down people in league with Jamwaal. As a result, many high-profile individuals and politicians are exposed.  In Canada, Himmat is set free. Shashank decides to propose to Neha and goes to her house along with Dan and Aditya. However, they find the house suspiciously empty and dark. Suddenly, they hear the footsteps of an intruder and confront him. They are shocked to find that the intruder is Siddhant, who tells them that Neha had been murdered a long time back. Now, it is revealed that the woman who was shot to death earlier was the real Neha. Siddhant explains that Jamwaal had had Neha killed and replaced a fake Neha, since he had had prior information to Aditya and Shashank's arrival in Canada. The day Altaf was arrested, Jamwaal suffered an accident and was arrested in a DUI. The real Neha, who had been following them at that point, only knew the real Himmat Mehendi, who had been with Jamwaal at the time and who had been killed by Irfan shortly after that event. Further more, Jamwaal had wanted to kill his former friends while they were trying to kill him too (Asif having sent the hit squad on the bridge). But when Altaf, his hired gun, was arrested by ATC, and even he was arrested kidnapped by the group while being assumed to be Himmat Mehendi, he kept the misunderstanding going and conned Aditya, Shashank and Dan to do what he had wanted Altaaf to do, thus making his coast clear. This leads to one shocking reality- The person that the group had assumed to be Himmat Mehendi was the real Jamwaal.  Still clueless about Jamwaal's plan, the quartet, once again, focuses on "JEET". Siddhant figures that every letter in the word has something to do with its position in the English alphabet. J is 10, the date of the attack; E is 5, denoting the month of May; E denotes the time, 5 o' clock and T is 20, which is still unknown. The group later receives information that a football match is supposed to take place at a nearby stadium on that date and the Prime Minister of India has been invited there as the Chief Guest, to be felicitated by the 20-25 thousand people present.  Realizing that this stadium will be bombed on the fateful day at 5 o'clock, the quartet turns up at the stadium and splits up. Early in the piece,  Siddhant is captured by the stadium guards, who were in on the plan. Aditya finds the bomb on a car whose registration number ends with the number 20 (thus explaining T in JEET), the timer having also been set at 20 minutes. He drives the car outside the stadium while. Shashank finds another bomb of the same size and takes it to a nearby flying club, where he runs into the fake Neha, who confesses that she has fallen in love with him. They load the bombs into a small plane, with Shashank deciding to dispose the bomb off in a deserted area, away from city limits. Dan enters the stadium by another route, only to end up being taken hostage along with his estranged wife and some school children she is escorting. Dan somehow rescues his wife and the children, while Siddhant manages to escape and kill some goons despite being temporarily blinded. As both head to different directions to find Jamwaal, the latter is informed by his men that both the bombs have been taken away and that the mission has failed.  Jamwaal tries to escape from the building, only to run into Siddhant. As Siddhant doesn't know him, Jamwaal nearly succeeds in escaping by pretending to be someone else, but Siddhant calls him on his bluff.  Here, Shashank realises that he has too little time to dispose off the second bomb safely, and decides to crash the plane along with himself and the fake Neha, much to Siddhant's anguish. He bids an emotional farewell to the others and then crashes the plane into a nearby lake. Meanwhile, Aditya also faces the same plight. Siddhant is distraught by the turn of events. Dan calls for help, with which he succeeds in rescuing Aditya just moments before the jeep explodes in a valley. Jamwaal tries to escape, but is tracked down and shot dead by Siddhant in an elevator.  The film ends as Shashank's ashes are immersed in the river while Siddhant laments that while everything had returned to normal after those 7 days, he had lost his brother forever.  
Duelist (2005 film)
 The movie opens with a fish tale narrated by a low-class metalsmith in a tavern in [[Joseon]]-era south-western [[Korea]]. The scene then cuts to a street circus, in which an elegant masked swordmaster ([[Gang Dong-won]]) fascinates his market-place audience. Undercover detective Ahn ([[Ahn Sung-ki]]), and his protÃ©gÃ© Namsoon ([[Ha Ji-won]]) are tracking down suspected money-counterfeiter gang, when the masked swordmaster ends his show by killing a government official who carries the kingdom's currency metal cast.  The swordmaster escapes when a cart crashes and disgorges a mountain of counterfeit coins, causing public commotion. The distraction is a success, but Namsoon chased and dueled with the escaping swordmaster/duelist, proving herself a master of martial arts specializing in a pair of long knives. She succeeded in cutting a quarter of his mask and glanced at his revealed eye before he escaped. She and her team are left with bodies of the counterfeiting gang, seemingly massacred in an instant by an unknown duelist.  It is then revealed that counterfeit coins are spreading wildly among the populace, causing hyperinflation that threatens the monarchy. The police forces are determined to find and arrest the counterfeiters, believed to include an insider in the government. From a secret connection, the detectives obtain a picture of the duelist, noted for his "Sad Eyes", which Namsoon recognizes from her previous encounter. Their suspicion points to Song, the powerful defense minister. This suspicion is confirmed when Namsoon spots the duelist entering Song's manor.  Namsoon and Ahn failed to chase the duelist. However, as Namsoon is walking alone in the night, Sad Eyes appeared from the shadows, asking if she is following him "because you like me?" Namsoon attacks, entering a duel that starts to become affectionate. Eventually, he vanishes after making a small cut on her clothing, revealing her cleavage. The resolute Namsoon persuaded her team to infiltrate minister Song's palace. This plan is implemented, resulting with only Namsoon succeeding in her thinly-disguised appearance as a [[lady of pleasure]]. Coincidentally, she ends up having to serve the duelist in private, which she handles very tactlessly.  Song called the duelist, interrupting Namsoon's session with her. Song turns out to be a superb swordsman, the only person who can outperform the duelist. Their conversation reveals that Song plans to overthrow the reigning young king and replace him with his future son-in-law, and that the duelist has been involved in this plan since childhood. Song reminds Sad Eyes that the duelist can kill him anytime he distrusts him, hinting that the duelist might be the planned royal successor. Song says that he always loved the duelist like a son.  After assaulting Sad Eyes in public, Namsoon is dismissed from the case by her director, only to be secretly assigned to find the final evidence to prove Song's involvement. Overhearing Namsoon's objectives, the duelist gave the needed evidence in a secret meeting with her, thereby sacrificing his destiny. Namsoon realizes her feelings for Sad Eyes. The father-figure Ahn recognizes this, advising her to forgo her feelings since he is a criminal while she is with the police. The movie draws towards a climax as scores of armed police surround Song's manor and attack the duelist and Song, as well as the other corrupt officials. In their last conversation, the minister tried to speak the nameless duelist's true name, but the police separate them and detective Ahn kills the minister.  After the battle, Namsoon anxiously searches for the duelist's fate, only to be told by Ahn that "he is dead". Devastated, she returns to the lanes where she had encountered the duelist, haunted by his images. While she is walking back, the duelist appears once more in front of her. Namsoon feels that finally she can express her feelings, and in a denouement the couple dances in a picturesque combat under the moonlight. They were fighting "like they were making love", but then "disappeared suddenly", as narrated by the metalsmith in the tavern from the first scene.  The final scene shows Namsoon and Sad Eyes spotting each other from a distance in the marketplace.  
Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God
 One hundred years after [[Dungeons & Dragons (film)|the first film]], Damodar survived his defeat by Ridley Freeborn, having been cursed by his former master, Profion, to walk the earth as an undead entity.  Driven insane by the curse, he seeks revenge against the kingdom of Izmir, and the descendants of those who defeated him.  After years of searching with the aid of two dark talon [[lizardfolk]] shaman, he locates the Orb of Faluzure, an ancient [[Magic item (Dungeons & Dragons)#Artifacts|artifact]] linked to the power of [[Faluzure]], a dragon god imprisoned under Saragasso's mountains.  With the Orb's power, he heals the curse, and prepares to awaken the dragon to destroy Izmir.  Lord Berek, a [[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|fighter]] and former captain of the king's guard, now a bored lord of the King, and Melora, his wife, a young [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|mage]], investigate reports of poison gas emanating from Saragasso's caves and find the still-slumbering dragon.  Researching the threat in Izmir's library, Melora excitedly reports to Oberon, the head of the Mages' Council, that Faluzure was imprisoned three thousand years ago by a powerful ancient civilization called the Turanians, who also created the Orb.  While trying to locate the Orb through magic, Melora is cursed by the much-more powerful Damodar, and begins dying slowly.  She hides her illness from Berek, who is appointed by the King to assemble a party of adventurers; small enough to infiltrate Damodar's lair undetected, but strong enough to face their enemies: Lux, a female [[Barbarian (Dungeons & Dragons)|barbarian]], Dorian, a male [[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|Cleric]] of [[Obad-Hai]], Ormaline, a female elven [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|wizard]], and Nim, a [[Rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|master thief]]. Together they resolve to locate the vault of the warlock Malek, a worshiper of the demon Juiblex who was gifted a magical scrying pool known as the Pool of Sight; Berek believes the pool will allow them to penetrate Damodar's defenses and reveal the orb's location.  The party sets out to locate Malek's Vault, while Oberon and the other mages try to decipher the tomes of Turanian magic in their library, to find a way to defeat the dragon.  While traveling through a haunted forest, Berek's party catches the attention of the powerful [[lich]] Klaxx the Maligned, who offers his services to Damodar. Damodar does not trust him, but is confident that the Orb makes him more powerful than Klaxx.  After losing Dorian, Berek's party finds its way to Damodar's castle.  Confronting him, Berek manages to take advantage of his overconfidence and steal the Orb, though Ormaline and Nim are badly wounded before the wizard teleports them to the Temple of Obad-Hai. While Ormaline and Nim are treated by the clerics, Berek rides back to Izmir, Lux staying behind to delay demons summoned by Damodar.  Using his shape-changing abilities, Klaxx infiltrates Izmir's castle, kills Oberon in his bath, and assumes his shape.  When Berek returns with the Orb, Melora uses it to unlock a vault discovered beneath the castle, where the Turanians hid the secrets of their magic.  Klaxx reveals himself, stealing the Orb back and kills the King, the new captain of the guard, and many of the castle's inhabitants, before returning the Orb to Damodar. Falazure awakens and destroys the Orb, regaining his godly power. Damodar asks Falazure to witness the city's destruction and rule over its remains as Falazure's servant; the dragon god agrees, but demands Damodar sacrifice 100 people every new moon in honor of Falazure's release.   While Berek rides in pursuit, Melora, who is near death, manages to decipher the Turanians' secret and rally the remaining mages in a magical attack that defeats the dragon.  Berek and Lux meet up and confront Damodar, who no longer has the Orb's power. They force him to cancel Melora's curse. Klaxx, who has no interest in helping Damodar, disappears with a laugh.  In the aftermath, Izmir is rebuilt, with Berek immersed in his ministerial duties, and Melora appointed as the new head of the Council of Mages.  Lux, Ormaline and Nim are shown to have fully recovered from their wounds.  Damodar is imprisoned in a dark dungeon beneath Izmir, but smiling to himself as if he is fully prepared to wait another hundred years to have his revenge.

Dust (2005 film)
 The protagonist, Aleksei, is a passive young outsider with a bloated body and poor vision. He does a monotonous job at ZAO Progress company (a typical name of a post-Soviet enterprise converted from a military plant into a company producing consumer goods), strives for nothing, wants nothing, is interested in nothing at all. He dedicates his free time to gluing plastic models of aircraft, which is quite similar to what he does at work. He apparently has no parents, perhaps they died, and lives in his grandmother's apartment, who loves her grandson and buys him second-hand clothes up to her taste. She must be an arduous Christian, but rather an andherent of one of numerous non-traditional confessions that emerged in Russia after the perestroika.  One day the CEO of Aleksei's plant invites him to his office where he meets two [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] officers who offer him to "help the Motherland's science" and to take part in a secret experiment. The latter, unbeknownst to him, represents a machine that can produce an effect of realizing one's most cherished dreams, which in Aleksei's case is a perfect body.

However, from then on he is obsessed with the desire to find the mysterious machine and to feel perfect once and once again.  
Edmond (film)
 Edmond Burke is a middle-aged [[Seattle]] businessman who visits a [[tarot]] fortune teller on the way home. She claims Edmond "is not where [he] belongs." He decides to make changes in his life, beginning by leaving his wife. At a bar, Edmond tells a fellow patron that he has not had sex in a while and that marriage took away his masculinity. The man gives him the address to a strip club, where Edmond is kicked out by a bouncer for not paying for a stripper's drink. Now even more sexually frustrated, Edmond goes to a [[peep show]]; having never been to such a place before, he is disappointed when he realizes that he is not allowed to have actual sex with the performer.  Next he goes to a [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] [[bordello]], but cannot afford a hooker. Edmond needs money, so he plays a [[three-card Monte]] game with a street dealer. When Edmond accuses the dealer of cheating, the dealer and his [[shill]] beat him up and steal his money. Edmond becomes enraged by what he sees as the contempt, prejudice and greed of society. He pawns his [[wedding ring]] in exchange for a knife. He is approached by a [[pimp]] who offers Edmond a "clean girl" and lures him to an alleyway, where the pimp attempts to mug him. In a wild rage, Edmond attacks the pimp with his knife while hurling [[racial slurs]] at him. He leaves him wounded and possibly dying in the alley.  Suddenly euphoric, Edmond enters a coffee shop and tells a young waitress, Glenna, his newfound worldview of instant [[gratification]]. They end up having sex at her apartment. Glenna likes him at first, but she is soon frightened by his increasingly erratic behavior and calls for help. An enraged Edmond slashes her to death, blaming her own insecurity for her murder. On a [[subway train]], he has an angry confrontation with a female passenger. Edmond comes across a church service where a minister preaches about respect and faith. Edmond feels the urge to preach about his own experiences, and as he stands in the doorway of the church, the woman from the subway recognizes him and calls into the street for the police. The responding officer pats Edmond down to find the knife in his front jacket pocket. Edmond is arrested.  In jail, Edmond begins to appreciate the security of his old life, but it is too late; the police have reason to believe that the knife found in Edmond's pocket may be the weapon used in Glenna's murder. The interrogating officer bluntly asks Edmond why he killed Glenna, to Edmond's shock and disbelief. He is sent to [[prison]] for her murder. There, Edmond is paired with a black cellmate. He likes prison because it is simple. He speaks of how he has always feared black people, but now that he shares a room with one, he can finally feel a bond. The indifferent cellmate then forces Edmond to perform [[oral sex]] on him. Edmond tells a prison minister what happened, but goes off on a [[tangent]], shouting that God has been unfair to him. When the minister asks why he murdered the waitress, he has no answer.  Years pass. Edmond has cut connections with the outside world, refusing to see visitors. He talks to his cellmate, with whom he has developed a friendly relationship, about the human ego and how life should not be taken for granted. He concludes that by conquering his fears, he might lead a better life. Both men ponder the [[afterlife]]. Edmond then goes to sleep comfortably alongside his cellmate. True to the tarot fortune teller's words, Edmond might well have found the place where he belongs.

Elektra (2005 film)
 After being killed in ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'', [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra Natchios]] is revived by a blind [[martial arts]] master called [[Stick (comics)|Stick]]. She is brought to his training compound to learn Kimagure, an ancient martial arts discipline that provides its practitioners with [[precognition]] as well as the ability to resurrect the dead. Elektra soon is expelled because of her inability to let go of her rage and fear from seeing her mother's killer as a child. She leaves and uses her training to become a contract killer.  Years later, Elektra infiltrates a heavily guarded area and succeeds in slaying her target DeMarco. Elektra's agent McCabe receives an unusually large offer from an anonymous client wishing to hire Elektra's services. The only stipulation; she must spend a few days in a rented home on the island where the assassination is to be performed before the names of the targets are revealed. During the wait, Elektra catches a girl named Abby trying to swipe her mother's necklace. She sends her away, and later meets and befriends her father, Mark Miller. Abby later invites Elektra to dinner on Mark's behalf. Elektra develops a romantic interest in Mark, but soon learns that he and Abby are the targets she has been hired to kill. Elektra spares them and leaves, but later returns in time to protect them from assassins sent by [[The Hand (comics)|The Hand]], a crime syndicate of [[ninja]] mercenaries.  Meanwhile, Roshi, master of The Hand, learns of the failed attempt and permits his son [[Kirigi]] to lead a new team of assassins to kill Elektra and return with Abby, referred to as "The Treasure". Elektra tries to leave Abby and Mark with Stick, but he scolds her into protecting them herself. She then drives Mark and Abby to McCabe's country house, but is followed by Kirigi, [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid]], [[Stone (Marvel Comics)|Stone]], Kinkou, and [[Tattoo (comics)|Tattoo]]. Elektra flees with Mark and Abby through a secret underground exit to the orchard, while McCabe sacrifices himself to allow them to escape.  Kirigi and the assassins hunt down the trio in a forest nearby. Elektra manages to kill Stone, while Abby and Mark kill Kinkou with one of his own daggers. As Elektra is distracted by the revelation that Abby has martial arts skills, Typhoid gives Elektra the "Kiss of Death". Abby is captured by Kirigi. Suddenly, Stick and his [[Chaste (Marvel Comics)|Chaste ninjas]] arrive, forcing Kirigi, Typhoid, and Tattoo to retreat. Stick manages to save Elektra from death and takes them under his protection.  Stick confirms that Abby is a martial arts prodigy which is the "Treasure" of martial arts whom the Hand seek to use. Elektra learns that she was a Treasure herself and her mother was a casualty of the fight between The Chaste and The Hand with her as the reason. She also guesses that Stick set up the hit on Mark and Abby in order to test Elektra's propensity for compassion. Elektra is not pleased, but does not follow up with that line of inquiry after getting the comment that some lessons must be lived. Elektra [[Astral projection|astrally projects]] herself to a meeting with Kirigi and challenges him to a fight; the winner claiming Abby for their own purpose.

Election (2005 film)
 The movie begins as the two-year term expires, and all the elders of the [[Wo Shing Wo|Wo Luen Shing]] are in the process of electing a new chairman, with some last-minute "campaigning" from both Lok and Big D just a few days prior to the election. Lok is calm, patient and even-tempered, while Big D, who attempts to buy the election, is boisterous, impatient and quick-tempered. After bitter arguments from supporters of both candidates in the likes of Uncle Cocky and Uncle Monk, Lok is elected as the new chairman. However, Big D is dismayed by the result and proceeds to punish two men responsible for his loss by kidnapping them and rolling them down a hill in boxes, prompting ex-chairman Whistle to ask his lieutenant Four-Eye to hide the dragon head baton, which is a symbol of power for the leader.  In an attempt to keep the peace and prevent infighting, the police, headed by Chief Superintendent Hui, arrest the key Triad figures, including Uncle Teng, Big D, Uncle Cocky, Uncle Monk and the newly elected chairman Lok of the Wo Luen Shing. However, during a negotiation attempt in a holding cell, Big D, in a fit of rage, threatens to break with the Triad and form his own society. The culture of the Triad emphasises brotherhood and unity; such a revolt would not be accepted by the Triad, and would lead to heavy violence. Both the heads of the Triad and the police want to avoid turf warfare.  Meanwhile, a pursuit of the baton ensues in which Kun (Blacky's henchman), who is recovering the baton for Big D catches up with Big Head (Tally's henchman), who holds the baton and is recovering it for Lok. During the confrontation, Kun severely beats Big Head with a giant log in order for him to hand out the baton when Kun's boss informs him that the plan has changed and that Kun is to recover the baton for Lok. The leaders are eventually released on bail and after hours of pursuit between Kun, Jimmy, and Jet en route, Lok eventually receives the baton from Jimmy thus making his election official.  Lok proposes a truce, which Big D accepts, on the terms that they will be partners and Big D will be the next chairman when Lok's term expires. Initially, this is a successful partnership; together they expand the Triad's turf. In contrast to his earlier behaviour, Big D becomes loyal to Lok, whom he now considers a good friend.  In the final scene, Lok and Big D are fishing on a sunny afternoon, accompanied by Lok's young son, Denny, and Big D's wife. While momentarily alone with Lok, Big D proposes that they share the power of chairman; it is not an uncommon practice to have more than one chairman. Lok agrees to support Big D. However, seconds later Lok attacks Big D from behind, using a small boulder to repeatedly smash in his head. Denny and Big D's wife return in time to see this. Lok orders his son to wait in the car, and proceeds to finish murdering Big D. He then runs after Big D's wife, attacking her with a shovel and then crushing her throat with a heavy branch. He buries both bodies, washes his hands in the water and goes to the car, where his visibly shaken son is waiting.

Karan Shah ([[Rahul Khanna]]) is Kantilal's adopted son. He was a mere canteen boy who was spotted and adopted by Kantilal while trying to secretly listen to a board-room discussion. He gained his father's trust over the years and was gradually given the responsibility of running the family business, much to the chagrin of his step-sister, Anjali. Upon hearing that his father's life is in danger, Karan returns from America and convinces his father not to give in to the extortionist's demands and instead ask him to provide that amount to his past victims and their families. Kantilal agrees. Then five days later, a day after his birthday, Kantilal is gunned down in the elevator along with four of his bodyguards. Anjali openly renounces Karan and asks him not to participate in her father's funeral. A shocked and devastated Karan announces to Baba that he will apprehend and bring him to justice in India, no matter where he had to look.  However, Karan finds out that Baba is hiding in Italy, which does not have an extradition treaty with India. Thus, unable to take any legal action, Karan recruits some mercenaries to go with him to Italy and help him bring Baba back to India. The first man he chooses is a suspended former police inspector, Arjun Srivastav ([[Arjun Rampal]]), who had located and brutally killed his then pregnant wife's assailants on his own and now lives as a single parent with his school-going daughter. After some persuasion from Karan and his daughter alike, Arjun agrees.  Arjun recommends that the second man involved be Abhimanyu ([[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]), who is currently in Vashi Jail and had been Baba's chauffeur and hitman before being framed by Baba and his associates following a failed job. Abhimanyu is rescued in broad daylight by Arjun and his men, who were pretending to be doctors, on the pretext of a medical checkup (The escapade takes place dramatically, in a style adopted from the film ''[[Spy Game]]'' to spring Elizabeth Hadley ([[Catherine McCormack]]) from a Chinese prison.) Arjun and Karan convince Abhimanyu to help them with vital information about Baba and his gang in return for a heavy payment. He reluctantly agrees to do so.  The trio then go to Venice (where Baba is said to be, based on Abhimanyu's information). There, Abhimanyu meets his girlfriend Sonia ([[Lara Dutta]]) and tries backing out of the mission by passing of Sonia as Baba's girlfriend who wants a huge amount of money for the information she would supposedly provide. Thus, under this pretext, he double crosses Arjun and Karan, takes the money, and tries escaping with the money along with Sonia. Before he can do so, both he and Sonia are kidnapped by Baba and his men. Priya ([[Amisha Patel]]), a press reporter from ''Aaj Tak'', looking for a story on Karan earlier, has followed the two there, using a satellite tracker for mobile phones. She meets them and tells them about Abhimanyu's deceit. Despite this, The three go to rescue Abhimanyu and Sonia, in a lengthy gunfight and high speed car chase. Karan and Arjun are angry at Abhimanyu's betrayal, however the latter apologizes and agrees to help them in return for their saving his life since he intends to settle scores with Salim ([[Chunky Pandey]]), one of Baba's trusted aides who had been instrumental in helping Baba set him up. The five then go and apprehend Salim and after some effort, he divulges at gunpoint that Baba is in Munich. Abhimanyu then shoots him for his betrayal. Karan finds Baba in Munich and tells him about Salim's death much to Baba's devastation, reiterating his warning that he would fulfil his promise of bringing the latter back to India at any cost.  In course of time, the group become good friends. Acting on a tip, when they go to Baba's guest house in Munich to catch him red handed, they are fooled and are then surrounded by Baba and his men. A lengthy gunfight follows, in the course of which, Arjun dies while getting into a jeep. Baba now warns Karan to leave him alone and save his own life and that of the others while there is still time. Devastated, Karan feels that bringing the others on the mission was a big mistake, much to Abhimanyu's fury. However he takes a final stand as Priya motivates him not to give up the fight at this point, reasoning that he had always been right, once when he had asked his father not to give in to Baba's demands and even now, when he had decided to gather the group to bring Baba back to India.  Karan and Abhimanyu, now go to apprehend Baba as he leaves the country through the French border. Sonia and Priya alert the French Border Police as France has an extradition treaty with India. The trick works, as Baba is cornered by Karan, Abhimanyu and the French border police just as he is crossing the border. A long and devastating gunfight ensues, at the end of which many of Baba's most trusted aides are killed. Finally, Baba is left alone and stranded after Karan stops Abhimanyu from shooting him, reasoning that the terror Baba inspired in people had to end and this would thus end Baba's life in turn.

The Exorcism of Emily Rose
 Emily Rose, a 19-year old American teenager, dies of self-inflicted wounds and [[malnutrition]] following an attempted [[exorcism]]. People say she was possessed by 6 demons. Father Richard Moore, the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] diocesan priest who attempted the exorcism is arrested and sent to court. While the archdiocese want Moore to plead guilty to minimize the crime's public attention, Moore instead plans to plead not guilty. Erin Bruner, an ambitious lawyer hoping to use the trial to become a senior partner in her law firm, takes on the case. Moore agrees to let her defend him if he can tell the truth behind Emily's story.  During the trial, Emily's past is told through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s and the evidence provided by witnesses. The trial's prosecutor is Ethan Thomas, a practicing [[United Methodist Church|Methodist]], with Judge Brewster presiding. The prosecution claims Emily suffered from [[epilepsy]] and [[psychosis]] to explain her behavior. Emily received a scholarship to study for a bachelor's degree but displayed signs of [[demonic possession]] after she began attending classes, experiencing visions and physical contortions. Diagnosed with epilepsy, Emily received anti-seizure medication but the treatment failed to cure her. A friend named Jason took Emily back home to her family, where she continued displaying traits of possession until Moore was summoned to attempt an exorcism.  Bruner begins experiencing supernatural phenomena at home, waking up at 3:00 a.m. to the smell of burning material. Moore warns her she may be a target for the demons, revealing he too has experienced similar phenomena on the night he was preparing the exorcism. With the prosecution building a strong case, Bruner steps up her own by trying to legitimize Emily's possession. She summons anthropologist Sadira Adani to testify about the beliefs about spiritual possession from various cultures, but Thomas dismisses her claims as nonsense. Graham Cartwright, a medical doctor who attended the exorcism, gives Bruner a cassette tape on which the exorcism was recorded.  Moore is called to the stand where he plays the tape. As seen in a flashback, Moore, Emily's father, Jason, and Dr. Cartwright participate in the exorcism while her mother and sisters pray in the living room. During the [[Lord's Prayer]], Emily attacks, causing the family cats to become agitated and attack Moore. As Jason and Cartwright help Moore, Emily escapes from her restraints, leaps out of a window, and flees to the family barn. The others give chase, Moore continuing the exorcism and demanding to know the demon's name. It responds by revealing there are six demons â those who possessed [[Cain and Abel|Cain]], [[Nero]], and [[Judas Iscariot]], a  member of [[Legion (demons)|Legion]], [[Belial]], and [[Lucifer]] himself. The exorcism abruptly ends when the men render aid to Emily's father, injured by runaway horses. Thomas reasons that Emily's behavior can be explained by learning ancient languages at school and her epilepsy.  Cartwright agrees to testify to authenticate the exorcism and refute the prosecution's medical care. However, he fails to appear at his allotted time, and Bruner goes looking for him. Seconds after finding Cartwright, the doctor is fatally struck by a car. A distraught Bruner retreats to her office and is warned by her boss that if she allows Moore to testify again, he will fire her. Bruner visits Moore in his jail cell, where he convinces her to allow him to tell the rest of Emily's story despite her boss's threat.  The next day, Moore takes the witness stand again and reads a letter that Emily wrote before she died. A flashback reveals that on the morning after the exorcism, Emily was [[Marian apparition|visited by the Virgin Mary]] in a field near her house. Offered a choice between ascending to [[Heaven]] or remaining to become a [[martyr]] but prove the existence of God and demons, Emily chose the latter. Moore explains she then received [[stigmata]] on her arms, but Thomas claims she gained the markings from grabbing a barbed wire fence surrounding the Rose family farm.  The jury ultimately reaches a verdict of guilty but surprise the court by asking Judge Brewster to give a sentence of time served. Although momentarily shocked by the suggestion, she ultimately accepts it, and Father Moore is free to go. Bruner is offered the position she wanted, but declines. Later, Moore and Bruner pay a visit to Emily's grave wherein the former states that the time will come wherein Emily will be declared a saint.  
Evil Aliens
 The film begins with the [[alien abduction]] on Scalleum, a remote island off the coast of [[Wales]], of Cat Williams and her boyfriend. Cat's boyfriend is gorily killed through brutal [[anal probing]], and Cat is (also gorily) implanted with an alien fetus. Cat's story attracts the attention of Michelle "Foxy" Fox ([[Emily Booth]]), the bosomy host of the cable TV show ''Weird Worlde'', who brings a film crew to the island &mdash; her cameraman boyfriend Ricky (Sam Butler); Jack the sound man; nerdy UFO expert Gavin Gorman; and actors Bruce Barton and Candy Vixen (the latter, Foxy's producer assures her, "because she's good, not because she's my girlfriend").  The island is accessible via a narrow [[causeway]] only at low tide. The ''Weird Worlde'' crew sets out in their van, but it is dark by the time they reach the Williams family's creepy farmhouse, where they meet Cat and her three hulking and sadistic brothers (who speak only Welsh with English subtitles). The crew (with the exception of Gavin Gorman) initially assume that Cat's story is a hoax, and even go so far as to make a [[crop circle]] in a nearby field so they can film it for the show, to Gorman's great disgust. However, it soon turns out that the aliens are all too real and rather malevolent.  The film crew teams up with the Welsh Williams brothers to fight off the aliens, with a great deal of blood and gore. One highlight features Ricky running down some aliens in a [[combine harvester]], to the tune of "[[Brand New Key#Combine Harvester|Combine Harvester (Brand New Key)]]" by [[The Wurzels]].  Eventually, the alien child inside Cat claws its way out; on board the alien ship, Foxy is impregnated with another alien fetus while Gavin loses his virginity to a shapely female alien; Bruce, Candy, and the Welsh brothers meet various horrible demises; Ricky blows up himself and four alien pursuers in a tank of liquid manure; back at the house, the female alien rips Foxy in half; and finally Gavin manages to use his laptop (in a sequence reminiscent of ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'') to overload the [[ley line]]s of the nearby [[stone circle]]. As Cat's alien child rips his arms off, Gavin manages to press the [[space bar]] with his nose, sending the stones shooting into the underside of the alien craft, which crashes into a convenient mountain. Jack the sound man, meanwhile, having been blinded by alien ichor early in the film, swims across the channel to the mainland, only to discover that he's lost the videotape that was the only proof of their extraterrestrial encounter.  The film ends with a clip from an alien [[talk show]] reminiscent of ''[[The Jerry Springer Show|Jerry Springer]]'' (and subtitled in English), on which Gavin's female alien is trying to explain how her entire crew was killed by humans and she herself carries the love child of one of those humans. The audience roars with laughter, and the host cuts her mike.

The film follows Chinaski as he works at, and gets fired from, various jobs, which include cleaning a massive sculpture, delivering ice, working at a pickle factory, and in a bicycle shop. In the course of sampling the smorgasbord of short-lived occupations, he meets up with assorted eccentric, frequently alcoholic characters.  The first woman Chinaski meets in a bar becomes his most consistent companion throughout the film. Jan ([[Lili Taylor]]), like Chinaski, is an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]]. He moves in and becomes her lover and drinking partner. They co-exist comfortably in languid squalor until Chinaski becomes upset after an altercation where he beats a wealthy man at the racing track who refuses to give up his seat. Initially polite, Chinaski assaults the man after Jan challenges his behavior. Soon after, Chinaski leaves Jan.  Unemployed again and scoring his next drink, Hank meets another female barfly, Laura ([[Marisa Tomei]]), who feels sorry for Chinaski and helps him procure alcohol with the help of her wealthy "sugar daddy" Pierre, an eccentric older man. After a strange misadventure on Pierre's boat, Chinaski briefly returns to Jan, who is now working as a chambermaid at a hotel. A pivotal scene occurs with Jan after Chinaski discovers that he has caught a case of the [[pubic lice|"crabs"]] from her. Chinaski gains work but quickly loses his job after deciding to drink instead of completing cleaning a large statue.  Chinaski and Jan again break up after realizing their relationship has become boring and predictable and that they no longer really need each other.

By the film's end Chinaski finds that he is most comfortable being alone with just his alcohol and his writing to keep him company. In the final scene Chinaski justifies his lifestyle. While drinking, and watching a topless pole dancer, he describes the costs, persistence needed, and rewards of writing. In voiceover he says, "If youâre going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, donât even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind... You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. Itâs the only good fight there is."

Fantastic Four (2005 film)
 Physicist [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] is convinced evolution was triggered millions of years ago on Earth by clouds of cosmic energy in space and has calculated that one of these clouds is soon going to pass near Earth. Together with his friend, astronaut [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], Reed convinces [[Doctor Doom|Victor Von Doom]], his former classmate at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and now CEO of Von Doom Industries, to allow him access to his privately held [[space station]] to test the effects of a biological sample of exposure to the cloud. Doom agrees in exchange for control over the experiment and a majority of the profits from whatever benefits it brings. Reed brings aboard his ex-girlfriend and Von Doom's chief genetics researcher [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]] and her ex-astronaut younger brother [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]].  The quintet travels to outer space to observe the [[Cosmic ray|cosmic energy clouds]], but Reed miscalculates and the clouds materialize ahead of schedule. Reed and the Storms leave the shielded station to rescue Grimm, who had gone on a spacewalk to place the samples. Grimm receives full exposure in outer space, while the others receive a more limited dose within the station. Back home they soon develop [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]]s: Reed can stretch his body like rubber, Susan can become invisible and generate [[force shield]]s, Johnny Storm can engulf himself in fire and fly unaided, and Grimm becomes a rock-like creature with superhuman strength and durability. Meanwhile, Von Doom faces a backlash from his stockholders because of the publicity from the space mission, and has a scar on his face that came from an exploding control console on the station.  Grimm's fiancÃ©e Debbie cannot handle his new appearance and leaves him. Grimm goes to brood on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] and accidentally causes a traffic pileup while preventing a man from committing suicide. Grimm, Reed and the Storms use their various abilities to contain the damage and prevent harm, including saving the crew of an [[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]] ladder truck that nearly fell off the bridge due to the chaos. The media dub them the Fantastic Four. They move into Reed's lab in the [[Baxter Building]] to study their abilities and seek a way to return Grimm to normal. Von Doom, himself mutating, offers his support but blames Reed for the failure of the spaceflight, which has lost him his company's hope for an [[Initial public offering|IPO]].  Reed tells the group he will construct a machine to recreate the storm and reverse its effects on them, but warns it could possibly accelerate them instead. Meanwhile, Von Doom's arm has become organic metal, giving him superhuman strength allowing him to produce bolts of electricity, and he begins plotting revenge. He drives a wedge between Grimm and Reed, who has rekindled his relationship with Susan Storm. Using the machine, Von Doom restores Grimm to human form, while accelerating Von Doom's condition, causing much of his body to turn to metal. Von Doom knocks the human Grimm unconscious and captures Reed.  Now calling himself [[Doctor Doom]], he puts on a metallic mask and a cloak to hide his disfigurement, Doom then tortures Reed and fires a [[heatseeking missile]] at the Baxter Building in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat Johnny. Sue confronts Doom but is outmatched. Grimm arrives to assist her, transformed into the Thing again by reusing the machine. The battle then spills into the streets, and the Storms combine their powers to wrap Doom in an inferno of intense heat, while Grimm and Reed douse him with cold water, inducing [[thermal shock]] and freezing Doom in place. Grimm informs Reed that he has accepted his condition with the help of [[Alicia Masters]], a blind artist for whom he has developed feelings, and the team embraces its role as superheroes. Reed proposes marriage to Sue, who accepts. Meanwhile, Doom's statue-like remains are being transported back to his homeland of [[Latveria]] when the dock master's electronic [[Manifest (transportation)|manifest]] briefly undergoes [[electromagnetic interference]], suggesting that Doom is still alive.

Everett finds himself attracted to the more outgoing Julie. Meredith desperately tries to fit in, but her strained attempt to play [[charades]] and a clumsy effort to engage the family in a dinner table discussion about [[nature versus nurture]] and [[sexual orientation]] prove to be disastrous and their father, Kelly Stone ([[Craig T.

He tells Destiny about being ripped off and she asks if he wants to kill the producer. He says yes, and that he wants to kill all straight people. India goes to the producer's home with a gun. He finds the producer and pulls the trigger, but the gun is not loaded.  A few days later, as they discuss plans to foment the collapse of the straight world, Destiny, India and Lester meet Spencer (Lance Lee Davis), a [[graffiti]] artist and self-proclaimed "bomber," They immediately "adopt" him. After spending the night together, Spencer and India discover the basher's address inside his coat and decide they want to go bash him.

Destiny (realizing that Vic is attracted to her) advises him that they're already always watching out for themselves.  Spencer and India are approached on the street by a photographer. As the pair pose together nude on a bed, Spencer recites a litany of injuries he has received at the hands of his parents and other straights. India tries to comfort him but Spencer says he no longer has feelings and doesn't let anyone in. India vows to protect him from the straights.  The next morning, on the way to the basher's house, India discovers a [[detonator]] in Spencer's backpack. Spencer tells him that he plans to blow up his parents. India tries to dissuade him but Spencer is not convinced that bombing straights isn't the way to go.  India and Spencer spot the basher in his neighborhood and argue over whether they should bash him as Spencer wants or try to "save" him as India wants. India has adopted Destiny's theory, that all gay bashers are themselves repressed gays who need to be saved.  India returns the basher's jacket. The basher, Guy (Adam Larson), admits that he's gay. He packs his things and tells the other basher, his roommate Quentin (Josh Paul) that he's gay, he loves him and believes Quentin loves him too.

They confront Destiny about being involved with a cop, until Destiny realizes who Guy is and orders him out. India and Spencer threaten to leave with him, but Guy agrees to go. India appeals to Destiny and she relents. India and Spencer chase after him but can't find him. Meanwhile, Guy returnes to the apartment and apologizes for attacking them. Destiny accepts him and Lester nicknames him "Killer."  India wants to make plans for the evening with Spencer but Spencer already has plans, to blow up his parents. India begs him not to go, saying that he won't come back from it.  Destiny interrupts another gay bashing. The basher strikes her with a baseball bat and Destiny shoots him. Later, Vic comforts her and Destiny tells him he has to be careful around her kids. They all have "police stories."  Quentin, in response to a message from Guy, arrives at Destiny's apartment, where he finds Guy in bed with India and Spencer. Quentin orders him to come away with him, giving him the choice of "straight or dead." The boys argue that Quentin is in love with Guy and Quentin breaks down, admitting how much in love with Guy he is. Quentin again points the gun at his own head but Guy stops him and they kiss.  India appeals again to Spencer not to blow up his parents. He says that if Spencer really wants to kill them, he will help, but if Spencer really wants to blow them away, he will stay with India. "All we have to do is kiss, because when two guys kiss it's like a bomb going off in the straight world. Our kisses are louder than bombs." Spencer admits that he has fallen in love with India but is terrified because he's losing control. But he also feels safe, like he's home. India tells him that wherever they are, as long as they are together they're home. They kiss, and with each kiss they call out a target that their kiss has destroyed like a bomb, finally declaring that they will blow up the whole straight world.  
The Fatalist
    
Feast (2005 film)
 As people are enjoying drinks in a bar, a man covered in bloodâidentified onscreen as "Hero" ([[Eric Dane]])âenters through the door and warns them all of impending danger. No one heeds his warning, so he shows the bar patrons the head of a repulsive creature to make them take him seriously. He is soon pulled through a window and decapitated by one of the monsters. After the carnage, a womanâ"Heroine" ([[Navi Rawat]])âbursts through the door and reveals herself to be the recently deceased man's wife. After a brief sentimental moment between the wife and her late husband, the bar patrons begin boarding up the windows in the bar. Despite their efforts, a young monster bursts through an uncovered window and begins attacking. As a monster outside bursts its hand through "Vet" ([[Treach|Anthony "Treach" Criss]]), "Edgy Cat" ([[Jason Mewes]]) has his face torn off and is accidentally shot dead, and the little monster cuts off the leg of one of the women â "Harley Mom" ([[Diane Ayala Goldner]])âwho is initially assumed to have died from massive blood loss.  The monster disappears for some time, then is found attempting to sexually penetrate one of the deer heads nailed to the wall. A shotgun blast removes the deer head and monster. The monster drops into a freezer which is then sealed shut, trapping it inside. Following this, the remaining windows are boarded up and the bar patrons are given a moment of peace. Trying to call for help, they learn that the only phone in the bar has been hit by a stray shotgun blast and rendered useless. One of the womenâ"Tuffy" ([[Krista Allen]])âsuddenly realizes that her son Cody ([[Tyler Patrick Jones]]) is still upstairs and runs to get him. Once she finds her child the group rejoices until the boy is pulled through a window and eaten by one of the monsters, leaving only his right foot behind. Tuffy is incapacitated by grief, while the monster vomits a stream of slime at one of the groupâ"Beer Guy" ([[Judah Friedlander]]). As the remaining people regroup downstairs, they realize that the slime has a decomposing effect and that Beer Guy is being slowly overcome by its effects.  The group kills the young monster in the freezer and hangs it outside. The monster's parents quickly eat the child, have sex and produce two offspring in a matter of seconds, all of whom begin to attack the pub with renewed fury. Meanwhile, one of the womenâ"Honey Pie" ([[Jenny Wade (actress)|Jenny Wade]])âbegins washing off the blood and has to take off her clothes, much to the amusement of the others. The patrons regroup and enact various attempts to escape or drive off the monsters, including using Harley Mom's body as bait while the Heroine and the "Coach" ([[Henry Rollins]]) attempt to escape. Upon discovering she's still alive, "Bossman" ([[Duane Whitaker]]) continues to sacrifice her to the creatures. The distraction fails, leading to the accidental death of the Heroine at the hands of another character, "Bozo" ([[Balthazar Getty]]). Driven by rage over the death of her child, Tuffy aggressively takes charge of the remaining survivors, which results in the audience seeing her nickname change from "Tuffy" to "Heroine 2". After "Coach" and "Bossman" are killed, "Honey Pie" successfully makes it to a truck, giving the other characters brief cause for hope (until they realize she is speeding off by herself).  A fight to the death between the last remaining humans and monsters ensues, resulting in the deaths of "Beer Guy" and supposedly the "Bartender" ([[Clu Gulager]]). Bozo, his brother Hot Wheels ([[Josh Zuckerman (actor)|Josh Zuckerman]]), and Tuffy (Heroine 2) survive, and drive off to retrieve the Heroine and Hero's daughter. One personâ"Grandma" ([[Eileen Ryan]])âis shown to still be alive within the bar but is attacked by one of the remaining monsters.  
Feed (2005 film)
 Australian cop Phillip (Patrick Thompson) works as a [[cybercrime]] investigator for [[Interpol]]. Phillip finds himself shaken after investigating a case in Hamburg, Germany, in which a man consents to have his penis cut off and eaten by his lover. Phillip's own relationship is troubled due to his frequent travel and difficulties with romantic intimacy, and he finds himself unable to respond positively to his beautiful girlfriend's sexual overtures. The two have rough sex that gets out of hand, and she leaves him after writing "pig" on his chest with lipstick.  Meanwhile, Phillip has been working with his partner, Nigel ([[Matthew Le Nevez]]), to investigate a fetish website that features morbidly obese women being held captive and fed fattening food. The website's intricate encryption suggests that the webmaster is concealing a deeper perversion, and, despite the objections of his superiors, Phillip travels to Toledo, Ohio, to investigate the webmaster and determine the whereabouts of "Lucy," a former site favorite. In Ohio, the site's sadistic webmaster, Michael Carter ([[Alex O'Loughlin]]), holds Deidre (Gabby Millgate) captive in a ramshackle cottage in the woods. After questioning a local priest, Michael's adoptive sister, and his thin, attractive wife, Phillip manages to track Michael to the cottage, where the latter is preparing to feed Deidre a thick slurry of eggs and weight gain powder. Phillip learns that Michael developed a sexual fascination with obese women due to his troubled relationship with his overweight, immobile mother, who died when he was a child. He also uncovers the twist in Michael's fetish website: not only are paying site members able to watch him feed and fornicate with obese women, but they can place bets on when each woman will die, using posted statistics on their body proportions, blood pressure, and other medical indicators.  In the cottage, Phillip finds Lucy's decaying remains and then confronts Michael; Michael reveals that he killed his mother and fed Lucy until she died. The slurry-like preparation he was attempting to feed Deidre through a tube contains some of the fat he had carved from Lucy's body. After a struggle, Phillip shoots Deidre, who maintains her love for Michael even as Philip tells her about his deceptions, and two shots can be heard off screen.  The final scene reveals Phillip living in suburban bliss with Michael's overweight adoptive sister. He takes some sandwiches she has packed for him and drives to the cottage in the woods, where he eats them with gusto, pausing to tantalize Michael, who is in a wheelchair, with one. Michael, starving and emaciated, begs Phillip, "feed me."

Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children
   ===Setting===  ''Advent Children'' takes place two years following the events of the 1997 [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', during which the antagonist [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]] attempted to absorb the Lifestream (the lifeblood and soul of the planet) and be reborn as a god.<ref name="FF7quote"/> He was defeated by [[Cloud Strife]] and [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series|his companions]] but Sephiroth's final spell, Meteor, destroyed the city of Midgar.     Since the end of the game, the survivors of Midgar founded the new city of Edge where Cloud and his childhood friend [[Tifa Lockhart]] now run a courier service and are the caretakers of orphans [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series#Denzel|Denzel]] and [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series#Marlene Wallace|Marlene]]. Cloud is still haunted by his role in the death of [[Aerith Gainsborough]], who was killed by Sephiroth. In addition, both he and Denzel are infected with a mysterious new ailment known as "Geostigma", which has no known cure. When the film opens, Cloud has recently moved out and isolated himself from his friends.  ===Story===  Cloud is contacted through Tifa and summoned to a meeting with the Shinra Company's former president [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series#Rufus Shinra|Rufus Shinra]], who was presumed killed in ''Final Fantasy VII''.<ref name="FF7rufus"/> Rufus asks for Cloud's help to stop [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series#Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo|Kadaj, Loz, and Yazoo]]. The trio are physical manifestations of Sephiroth's surviving spirit, and are seeking to resurrect him using the remains of the [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] villain [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series#Jenova|Jenova]].<ref name="jenova"/> Cloud refuses to help and leaves.  Meanwhile, Kadaj and his colleagues are recruiting children infected with Geostigma. Denzel falls in with the group, attracted by their promises of a cure for the disease. Loz follows Tifa and Marlene to Aerith's church, where they had gone looking for Cloud, and attacks them. Tifa is knocked unconscious in the fight and Loz kidnapped Marlene. All the kidnapped children are taken to the ruins of the mystical Forgotten City, where Kadaj embraces them as brethren and announces his intention for them all to be reunited with Jenova. When Cloud arrives to rescue them, he is overpowered by Kadaj's gang, but is rescued by his old comrade [[Vincent Valentine]]. Demoralized by his failure, Cloud asks if sin can ever be truly forgiven, to which Vincent nonchalantly replies that he has never tried to forgive. Cloud decides to keep fighting and returns to the city, where Kadaj has summoned Bahamut SIN and other monsters to terrorize the population.<ref name="InteSakurai"/> With the help of his companions from ''Final Fantasy VII'', Cloud engages and defeats the monsters.  Kadaj confronts Rufus Shinra, who reveals he possesses the box containing Jenova's remains. He attempts to destroy it, but Kadaj manages to save it and flees the city with his companions. Yazoo and Loz are apparently destroyed along the way by an explosive planted by Shinra's agents. Cloud chases Kadaj down and engages him in battle, ultimately subduing him. Outmatched, Kadaj opens Jenova's box and fuses with its contents, transforming into Sephiroth. He then tells Cloud that he will be able to use the life essences of Geostigma sufferers to achieve complete domination over the planet.<ref name="cosmos"/> He and Cloud then fight, and throughout the whole encounter, Sephiroth appears to have the upper hand, flinging Cloud repeatedly into walls and finally impaling him through the shoulder. He asks Cloud to tell him what he most cherishes so that he can have the pleasure of taking it away. To this, Cloud replies that he cherishes everything, then pulls out Sephiroth's sword and deals him a hail of devastating blows. Sephiroth's spirit departs, leaving behind the mortally wounded Kadaj. As he lies dying in Cloud's arms, a healing rain starts falling across the land, curing the people of their Geostigma. Yazoo and Loz appear and confront Cloud; he charges at them, and they set off a massive explosion engulfing the three.  Cloud has a vision of his deceased friends Aerith and [[Zack Fair]], who say that his time to join them has not yet come. He then awakens in the church, healed of his injuries and surrounded by his friends. Behind them, he sees Aerith and Zack leaving the church and hears Aerith's voice say, "You see, everything's all right." He agrees: "I know. I'm not alone... not anymore."  
Fever Pitch (2005 film)
 Ben Wrightman, a 7-year-old boy, is going to a [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]] game with his Uncle Carl. His uncle, who had no children of his own, treated Ben like a son. A narration explains that on that day, Ben became a [[Red Sox Nation|die-hard Red Sox fan]]. Just about everything he owns bears the Red Sox name, emblem, or image of a Red Sox player (with the exception of his toilet paper, which bears the [[New York Yankees]] insignia). Ben inherited his uncle's season tickets when Carl died from cancer. The story picks up 23 years later with Ben ([[Jimmy Fallon]]) as a school teacher who is immature for his age. He meets Lindsey Meeks ([[Drew Barrymore]]), a professionally successful workaholic executive. When Ben first asks her out, Lindsey rejects him, but she later changes her mind and agrees to go out with him.  On their [[First date (meeting)|first date]], Ben finds Lindsey very sick and vomiting. She has [[food poisoning]] from a new restaurant where she had dined earlier that day. Ben decides to spend the night and take care of her, as well as clean up her bathroom (whimsically telling her it was the "Vomit Elves" that did the work). The next morning, Lindsey, feeling better, finds Ben sleeping on her couch. Ben awakens, and he and Lindsey end up developing a romantic [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]].  Overcoming her initial hesitance, Lindsey becomes attracted to Ben because of his ability to show passionate commitment to something. That spring, he later pretends he is proposing to her but instead asks her to the Red Sox [[Opening Day]], where [[Stephen King]] (a longtime Sox fan) throws the first pitch. Lindsey attends, but not being a baseball or Red Sox fan, she knows nothing about the [[Curse of the Bambino]] or even how to pronounce the name [[Carl Yastrzemski|Yastrzemski]]. The two continue attending the games together until one summer night when Lindsey attempts to catch up on work by taking her laptop to the game.  Not paying attention to the game, she is knocked out by a [[line drive]] [[foul ball]] by then [[Baltimore Orioles]] [[shortstop]] [[Miguel Tejada]] off [[Mike Myers (baseball)|Mike Myers]] (which ends up making the late night sports highlight reel).  She eventually recovers but stops going to the games.  Things take a turn for the worse when Lindsey invites Ben to accompany her to Paris, and he declines the offer because the Red Sox are in the heat of the playoff race. Before leaving for Paris, she tells Ben she is "late" and may be pregnant with his child, though they later learns she is not.  Lindsey starts to become fed up with Ben's [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]] with the Red Sox. Ben agrees to miss a game [[YankeesâRed Sox rivalry|against the Yankees]] in order to escort Lindsey to her friend's birthday party.  Ben and Lindsey have a wonderful time together, and after making love, he tells her it was one of the best nights of his life.  Moments later, Ben receives a call from his ecstatic friend Troy, who informs him that the Red Sox overcame a seven run deficit in the bottom of the ninth inning to pull off one of the greatest comebacks in team history.  Ben becomes irate that he missed such an historic Red Sox moment, greatly hurting Lindsey's feelings.  After Lindsey miserably declares he has broken her heart, he and Lindsey separate for a while.  Ben soon misses Lindsey and visits her in a futile attempt to reconcile.  He eventually feels her loss so deeply that he plans to sell his season tickets to Chris, the husband of Lindsey's friend Robin (for $125,000 â the price for which Red Sox owner [[Harry Frazee]] sold [[Babe Ruth]] to the Yankees in 1920), in order to prove that Lindsey means more to him than the Red Sox do.  Lindsey finds out about his plan during the celebration for her much-anticipated promotion.  Immediately leaving the celebration, she rushes to the ballpark to try to stop Ben. She gets in during the 8th inning of the Red SoxâYankees playoff game when the Sox are just three outs away from being swept.  Ben is actually in the process of signing a contract with Chris as they sit in the stands.  Because she is unable to reach Ben from her section in [[Fenway Park]] in time to stop Ben from signing the contract, Lindsey illegally runs across the field, deftly avoiding security personnel as she eventually reaches Ben. She tears Chris' contract in pieces and explains that if Ben loves her enough to sell his seats, then she loves him enough not to allow him to do so.  The two reunite and kiss in front of the entire crowd.  The narrator (Al Waterman) explains how the Red Sox won that game and then beat the Yankees three more times to win the [[American League]] [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]], later sweeping the [[National League]] champion [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in four games for their first [[World Series]] title in 86 years, with Lindsay and Ben traveling to [[Busch Stadium (II)|Busch Stadium]] in St. Louis for the decisive Game 4. The two of them also get married, and she gets pregnant. Al explains that the baby will be named after one of the players: [[Ted Williams]] Wrightman if it's a boy, Carla Yastrzemski Wrightman (for [[Carl Yastrzemski]]) if it's a girl, with the narration jokingly hoping for a boy.  
The Final Kiss
 This film follows the exploits of two [[rock music|rock]] stars ''Nick Cross'' and ''Christian'', who are played by ''Scott Shaw'' and Kenneth H. Kim respectively. The Christian character recruits ''Nick Cross'' to reenter the world of [[Rock n' Roll]] but he is far too lost in his use of [[heroin]] to move forward with the project. This leads to the ongoing degeneration of the primary characters and their individual girlfriends until several members of the cast either die from the use of drugs or the gunplay generated by the ''Nick Cross'' character due to his anger at these deaths.  
Film Geek
 Scotty Pelk is a [[socially inept]] film geek who works at a video store called Video Connections in [[Portland, Oregon]].  His biggest claim to fame is his website, www.scottysfilmpage.com (which has yet to receive a hit).  He is a hard worker, but eventually gets fired for being too much of an annoyance to the customers. In a funk, he visits several video stores around town to try to find a job, but none of the stores are hiring.  While traveling on the [[MAX Light Rail|MAX]] to the Portland Staffing Resources office, Scotty sees a young woman, Niko, reading a book called ''The Films of David Cronenberg.''  He is infatuated and chases her down to talk to her about Cronenberg, but she essentially brushes him off.  At the Portland Staffing Resources office, Scotty finds a job working with auto parts. He is confused and lost during his first day at work, all the while continuing to talk about movies with his co-workers. On the way home, he sees Niko again and joins her for coffee, and she invites him to her art show later that night.  During the show, Niko kisses Scotty to make her ex-boyfriend, Brandon, jealous. Later, the two go out and sit in Niko's car to talk.  Scotty smokes [[marijuana]] with her, and they head to a party afterwards. At the party, Scotty gets drunk with two guys who are also film fans.  Scotty constantly calls Niko over the next few days, trying to ask her for a date.  She eventually says yes, and they go out to eat at a Mexican restaurant.  Afterwards, they watch a movie and then go to a bar.  Brandon shows up at the bar and upsets Niko, ending their date.  Scotty continues to obsess and call Niko frequently, but she does not answer her phone.  Eventually Niko picks up, but she brushes him off.  On the way to visit Niko with flowers and a balloon, Scotty sees Niko and Brandon kissing.  Niko then informs Scotty that she and Brandon have gotten back together, indicating that her interest in Scotty had been a ruse to make Brandon jealous.  Scotty goes home and, in a fit of rage and self-loathing, destroys the bouquet of flowers and balloon he had bought for Niko.  Scotty is shown masturbating in his bathroom (one of several such scenes), when he is interrupted by the phone ringing.  A ''Willamette Week'' newspaper editor is calling Scotty to do an article on him after hearing about his website from the two guys at the party.  Once the article is published, Scotty's website becomes popular around the city and he becomes a local celebrity, and eventually gets his own office.  While Scotty is signing autographs at Video Connections, Niko walks in after having a fight with Brandon.  After talking a little, Niko and Scotty get back together and kiss. Finally, the film cuts back to Scotty masturbating, with the implication that the phone call and all that followed was only a masturbatory fantasy. Reviewer [[D.K. Holm]] compared the surprise ending to [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]]'s ''[[An Affair of Honor]]'' and [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s ''[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]''.<ref></ref>

Fierce People (film)
 Trapped in his drug-dependent mother's apartment, 16-year-old Finn Earl ([[Anton Yelchin]]) wants nothing more than to escape [[New York City]]. He wants to spend the summer in [[South America]] studying the Ishkanani Indians (known as the "[[Fierce People]]") with his [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] father whom he's never met. Finn's plan has to change after he is arrested when he buys drugs for his mother, [[Lower East Side]] Liz ([[Diane Lane]]), who works as a [[massage therapist]]. Determined to get their lives back on track, Liz moves the two of them into a guesthouse for the summer on the country estate of her ex-client, the aging billionaire, Ogden C. Osbourne ([[Donald Sutherland]]).  In Osbourne's world of privilege and power, Finn and Liz encounter the [[ultra high-net-worth individual|super rich]], a tribe portrayed as fiercer and more mysterious than anything the teenager might find in the South American jungle. (Dirk Wittenborn, the author of the novel on which the film is based, grew up in a modest household and felt like an outsider among the super rich in an upper-crust New Jersey enclave.<ref>[http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-06-11/books/privileged-information/ Joy Press, "Privileged Information"], ''Village Voice'', 11 Jun 2002</ref>)  While Liz battles her [[substance abuse]] and struggles to win back her son's love and trust, Finn falls in love with Osbourne's granddaughter, Maya Langley ([[Kristen Stewart]]). He befriends her older brother, Bryce Langley ([[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]]); and wins the favor of Osbourne. When rape and violence ends Finn's acceptance within the Osbourne clan, the promises of this world quickly sour. Both Finn and Liz, caught in a harrowing struggle for their dignity, discover that membership in a group comes at a steep price.  
A Film by Aravind
 Childhood friends Aravind ([[Rajiv Kanakala]]) and Rishi ([[Richard Rishi]]) struggled for film industry fame before Aravind's films with Rishi as hero become. They made two blockbuster films together. Then Konda thought of directing a new story written by a new writer and made a job offer to some writers. He then saw a story written by a new writer on which Aravind's co-director unfortunately dropped some ink on the script. Aravind found the script very interesting and he along with his friend Rishi planned to go on a road trip to search for inspiration to complete the remaining script of a third film. During the ride, Aravind and Rishi meet Nirupama ([[Sherlyn Chopra]]), whom they save from goons. During the journey, Nirupama asked  Rishi to over take a 'black car' which was moving ahead of them. Rishi then drove the car at a great speed and overtook the car but in the mean time, that 'black car' got hit by a truck but Rishi and his friends had not seen the accident, so they moved forward. Rishi slowly fell in love with Nirupama while they were staying in a cottage. But soon Aravind also found Nirupama very interesting, and he also started loving her. Aravind and Rishi then realise that the events that occurred during their journey was very similar to the script that Aravind had read earlier. The last page that he read from the script prophesized that two friends will fight with each other for a girl and, they had actually fought over Nirupama.  And he called the writer of the script to the woods and asked him to complete the story. The writer said that the girl for whom the two friends were fighting is a psychopath and would kill one of the friends. Aravind believes that they might get killed, so he warns his friend Rishi to leave her and avoid her. But Rishi ignored him and wanted to elope with her and marry her. Aravind hears that a psychopath was moving in the area they live in and this news made him more sure that Nirupama was the psychopath.  Aravind planned to kill Nirupama and save his friend, but then the writer of the script in the story changed the climax of the movie to make the script a romantic script instead of a thriller. As the script changed, the reality also changes with Rishi being safe, but Aravind getting killed by the psychopath (the one on the news).  The reasons that made the psychopath kill Aravind and his friends was that she was in the 'black car' that met with an accident in the race. She felt that Rishi and his friends were responsible for her accident and planned to kill them.  Rishi after seeing his friend die, fought with the real psychopath and killed her.  
Flightplan
 Recently widowed [[Berlin]]-based American aircraft engineer Kyle Pratt is taking her husband David's body back to the U.S, after his untimely death. She and her six-year-old daughter, Julia, are flying aboard an Aalto Airlines Elgin 474, an aircraft Kyle helped design. When Kyle awakens from a short nap, Julia is missing. None of the passengers or crew recall seeing Julia. Flight attendant Stephanie later claims there is no record of Julia boarding and the passenger manifest registers the child's seat as unoccupied. Julia's boarding pass and backpack are also missing. Kyle insists that Captain Marcus Rich conduct a thorough search of the plane.   Julia is not found and Kyle becomes increasingly desperate. She unjustly accuses two Arab passengers, Obaid and Ahmed, of kidnapping Julia and plotting to hijack the plane. Captain Rich and the flight attendants, particularly Stephanie, suspect Kyle is unhinged by her husband's death and may have imagined bringing her daughter on board. Because of Kyle's increasingly erratic and panicked behaviour, Captain Rich orders [[sky marshal]] Gene Carson to guard and handcuff her.   Later, Captain Rich receives a wire from a Berlin hospital claiming Julia died with her father. Kyle furiously denies this and insists the search continue. A therapist, Lisa, consoles Kyle, who starts doubting her own sanity until she notices the heart Julia drew on the foggy window next to her seat. Kyle asks to use the bathroom and, once inside, climbs through a trapdoor into the plane's overhead crawl space. She sabotages the aircraft's electronics, deploying the oxygen masks and cutting power to the plane's lighting. During the ensuing chaos, she rides a [[dumbwaiter]] to the lower freight deck. She finds and opens David's casket using the lock code, suspecting Julia may be trapped inside, but it only contains her husband's body. Carson finds her and escorts her back to her seat in handcuffs. He says the flight is making an emergency stopover at [[CFB Goose Bay|Goose Bay Airport]] in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland, Canada]] where she will be taken into custody.   Kyle makes a final plea to Carson to search the plane upon landing. Before speaking to the captain, Carson sneaks down the freight deck and removes two explosives and a detonator concealed in David's casket, then goes to the [[avionics]] section and plants and arms the explosives at an area where a presumably drugged Julia is sleeping. It is revealed at this point that Carson, Stephanie, and the Berlin mortuary director are part of a conspiracy to [[Aircraft hijacking|hijack]] the plane for a $50 million ransom and frame Kyle as the hijacker, due to her job and knowledge of the plane. The conspirators kidnapped Julia in hopes of Kyle unlocking the casket as she is the only one who knows the code. Carson lies to Captain Rich that Kyle is threatening to bomb the aircraft unless the ransom money is wired to a bank account and a [[Gulfstream G650|G3]] plane is readied upon landing. He then plans to detonate the explosives, which will kill Julia and leave Kyle dead with the detonator in hand.  After landing in Newfoundland, the tarmac is surrounded by U.S. [[FBI]] agents. After the passengers disembark, Kyle apologizes to Captain Rich for disrupting the flight but is certain Julia will be found. Angered, Captain Rich demands she drop the charade, stating that the $50 million has been wired. Kyle realizes that Carson is the perpetrator and, assuming the role of the hijacker, demands Carson remain aboard and the crew leave. Carson realizes he cannot refuse without giving himself away.  When the plane's door closes, Kyle knocks Carson unconscious with a fire extinguisher, handcuffs him to a rail, and takes the detonator. Stephanie appears and uncuffs Carson as he regains consciousness. He fires a gun at Kyle, sending her running and locking herself into the cockpit. She fools Carson away from the cockpit by throwing a binder in the plane's attic. Meanwhile, a panicked Stephanie flees the plane after a small altercation with Kyle.  Kyle finds the unconscious Julia in the avionics and narrowly avoids Carson. He reveals that David was murdered by the conspirators to conceal explosives in his casket (as caskets are not required to be x-rayed) and how he abducted Julia and dumped her in the food bin before disparaging the people aboard who would never care enough to notice. Kyle, carrying Julia, escapes into the cargo hold and closes the hatch. Leaning on David's casket with Julia in the non-combustible hold, she detonates the explosives, killing Carson. Everyone watches in shock and amazement as Kyle carries her daughter out onto the tarmac, realizing that she was telling the truth the whole time.  At an airport hangar the next morning, Captain Rich apologizes to Kyle and comments on how she and Julia look alike. As a handcuffed Stephanie is led away by FBI agents, one of the escorting agents informs Kyle of the arrest of the Berlin mortuary director, asking her to identify him. She carries the still unconscious Julia through the crowd of passengers to a waiting SUV while the passengers realize the truth. As an act of respect and forgiveness, Obaid helps Kyle load her luggage. Julia awakes and sleepily asks "are we there yet" as the SUV drives away.  
First on the Moon
 A group of journalists are investigating a highly secret document when they uncover a sensational story: that even before the [[Second World War]], in 1938, the first rocket was made in the USSR and Soviet scientists were planning to send an orbiter to the moon and back.  The evidence is convincing; it is clear that in this case, Soviet cosmonauts were first.  The movie follows the selection and training of a small group of cosmonauts. The one who shines above the others (similar to the clear front-runners in the early historical Soviet space program) is Captain Ivan Sergeyevich Kharlamov (possibly a reference to the real-life cosmonaut [[Valentin Varlamov]]). He is helped into a space suit and loaded into the capsule, and the rocket lifts off for the Moonâbut contact with it is soon lost.  Most of the remainder of the film seems to follow the search for information about what happened next, as the 1930s space program appears to have dissolved immediately after, with no reason given (but presumably as a part of Stalin's purges).  It is implied that Kharlamov returned to Earth, but with no fanfare and apparently no assistance from the space program.  A number of men are shown as suspected of being Kharlamovâthe [[NKVD]] seems to be conducting a criminal investigation of the program and it is implied that those involved, including Kharlamov himself, are in hiding.  It seems that the capsule returned to Earth and landed in [[Chile]], and that Kharlamov journeyed to the Soviet Far East by way of Polynesia and China, yet feared capture on his return.  His wife apparently covered for him when interrogated as to his whereabouts.  Kharlamov is later found on the Mongolian steppes following the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]], having suffered a severe [[traumatic brain injury]].  After undergoing psychiatric treatment in a sanitorium in [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]], he disappears. His wife later remarries.    The very end of the movie shows the only footage of the mission itself after launch, explaining it as a film which was found at the landing site in Chile and is currently in the possession of the [[Antofagasta]] Natural museum.  First there is a brief clip showing Kharlamov piloting the vehicle, presumably on final approach to the Moon.  Following that is an equally brief panorama of a lunar landscape with the capsule or lander (it's unclear whether this was a [[direct ascent]] Moon landing) resting on the surface, apparently taken by Kharlamov during lunar EVA.  Both scenes are shown as stills on the movie's cover.  Then there is a short clip of the other cosmonauts walking through a hangar with the 1930s space program director, and the credits roll.  
The Fine Art of Love
 Thuringia, Germany, in the early 20th century. A group of young girls are brought up in a college amid dark forests and gloomy dull lakes. Young Hidalla and her friends Irene, Vera, Blanka, Melusine and Rain are brought up in an isolated world: the girls know nothing about life beyond the college's high walls. They play near a beautiful waterfall and are ordered not to make contact with the servants, who are categorized as inferior people and wear masks to cover their faces. The girls are instructed in dance and music. Years later, Irene and Hidalla embark on a romantic relationship and are caught kissing in the school grounds by the servants. Vera begins to think that she is descended from royalty and attempts to unravel her origins, but finds that she was wrong. The six girls attempt to escape from the school but are confronted by guard dogs that attack and kill Melusine.  The girls are informed that they are going to hold a ballet presentation for a Prince. The best performer will be released from the school. A messenger arrives, ostensibly to check the girls' strength, but in reality she gropes them. Blanka is chosen as prima ballerina, but Irene, feeling Hidalla rightfully deserves the position, reveals to the Headmistress that she is sexually involved with another student, which turns out to be true after she stumbles upon them. After this, Hidalla is chosen as the prima ballerina.  When the ballet is finally held, the Prince becomes aroused by Hidalla's performance and tosses a rose at the stage. Intrigued, Hidalla continues strongly with her performance, and a terrified Irene commits suicide minutes before the final act. Shocked and enraged, Hidalla sets fire to the theater during the final act and is carried out by the Prince. The Headmistress is told that she is given the choice of a janitorial position and social ridicule and exile by peers at the school, or "the honorable decision" (her own death); while waiting in an official's office, she has a small glass of scotch and shoots herself in the mouth with the gun that was provided on the table. Hidalla is taken to the Prince's palace, where he brutally rapes her. The next morning she escapes the palace, only to stumble upon the school. She screams as she realizes her fate and the fate of the other girls: to become concubines and/or sex slaves for wealthy men, mostly the Prince. The last shot is a horse carriage, possibly carrying young baby girls to the school, coming through the gate, with the doors slamming behind it.  
Firecracker (film)
 The body of a murder victim is being exhumed from under a storage shed in 1950s small-town [[Wamego, Kansas]]. The story leading up to the murder is told.  Handsome, sociopathic, David, the owner of a local garage, bullies his meek, sensitive piano-playing younger brother, the teenage Jimmy. Their religious, mentally unbalanced mother, Eleanor, attempts to ignore David's behavior; their withdrawn and ill father is about to be placed in a nursing home. When Jimmy shyly announces at the family dinner table that his piano teacher plans to include him in an upcoming recital, David belittles and beats him, ordering him to give up his "sissy" piano and work at the garage, earn money and be a real man. Jimmy finds temporary escape from his family dysfunction by visiting a traveling carnival that stops in Wamego each summer. He forms a platonic friendship with the premiere sideshow attraction, Sandra, an aging but still glamorous lounge singer. Sandra is virtually a captive of the sadistic carnival owner, Frank, who abuses her emotionally and physically. While Jimmy dreams of running away to play piano for the carnival, Sandra has the opposite dream â to escape the carnival and live a normal life.  Sandra had a past relationship with David, but when he approaches her again, she makes it clear that she is no longer interested in him and tells him that she won't let him "hurt her" again. David goes home and takes out his frustrations on Jimmy, in a scene where sexual abuse is strongly implied but not shown. It is later revealed that David got Sandra pregnant the previous summer, and when the pathologically jealous Frank found out, he cruelly terminated her pregnancy and mutilated her genitals to make her unattractive to other men. Unwilling to take no for an answer, David confronts Sandra at her trailer, and discovers Jimmy hiding there. David flies into a rage, rapes Jimmy in front of Sandra, and storms out. Sandra consoles Jimmy, who goes home. The next day, the carnival leaves town, its departure coinciding with David's disappearance, which the female police chief, Edith "Ed" Carlisle, begins to investigate. It begins to appear that a murder, presumably of David, took place at his family's home.  Meanwhile, the carnival is losing money and Frank's treatment of Sandra is becoming worse, including sending his gang of brutal henchmen to menace her sexually. She resolves to leave and the other carnival freaks bid her goodbye. Jimmy arrives planning to join the carnival, but Sandra, knowing that the carnival is also a dysfunctional environment and not the escape of which Jimmy dreams, sends him home. Frank refuses to let Sandra go and instead chains her up. When Frank comes to see her in her chains, the other freaks help Sandra overpower him, and she strangles him to death with her chains. The freaks hide Sandra from Frank's vengeful henchmen and give her money and a bus ticket to help her escape, but the henchmen capture her in a field and brutally kill her.  Back in Wamego, flashbacks show how David came home to find Eleanor comforting the traumatized Jimmy in a locked room. David broke down the door, dragged Jimmy downstairs and started abusing him. Eleanor, praying, took a pair of scissors from a drawer and stabbed David to death. Jimmy and Eleanor then buried the body under the shed. Pearl, a local psychic girl, realizes the location of David's body and digs up his corpse, revealing a hand to Chief Ed. Eleanor, now clearly mentally ill, is taken away by attendants to a mental institution, while Jimmy cries. In an attempt to save his mother, Jimmy tearfully confesses to David's murder. Jimmy was sentenced to life in prison and  later released on parole, at which time Chief Ed, who had become a district judge, sealed the case so no record of it exists today.

Fish Heads Fugue and Other Tales for Twilight
  An old woman, short and stout, enters a room containing a small [[puppet theater]]. Between the tasks of setting up a [[phonograph]] and a [[film projector]], she carries in a large object, on top of which stands a [[statue]] of a [[dog]]. The dog comes to life. Inside the puppet theater, a mechanical platform rises up, revealing a miniature [[pianist]]. After a brief musical performance, the theater rotates, displaying an [[ocean]] scenescape - amidst other themed props, a [[fish]]'s head is depicted bobbing up and down in the water. The theater then rotates again, settling on a hilltop home.  Inside the dwelling, sits a [[porcelain doll]] in the form of a young girl. A blue, [[ghost|spectral]] [[drawing]] sits with her, until she is roused by a [[bell]]. As the girl leaves the room, the wispy drawing looks after her, and then vanishes. A [[cloak]]ed, pale-faced, old woman watches the young girl climb through the meandering, mechanical passageways of the puppet theater. She signals for a [[Bread|loaf of bread]] and then passes it on to the young girl.  A lonely red [[balloon]] floats down a hallway. It stops to hover by a grotesque couple, gorging themselves on an opulent [[Banquet|feast]]. The couple gaze at each other through richly designed fish [[masks]]. The balloon then passes on, reaching a [[tavern]]. The pianist is there, and three old men sit enraptured by a woman on stage. The young girl, who has made her way to the room as well, watches as one of the men casually swallows a pair of [[Levitate|levitating]] [[playing cards]].  Following the red balloon, the girl appears to return home. She is encountered however, by a rotating contraption, depicting a series of intricate masks. Her house is revealed to also be such a contraption. The young girl then appears standing alone in the puppet theater. The old woman, who set up the show, is watching. She directs a [[mechanical fan]] toward the girl, and the girl, covering her eyes in apparent fear, is blown away. The woman waves goodbye to an unseen audience.  
The Fog (2005 film)
   In 1871, William Blake arranges to purchase half of Antonio Island, off the coast of [[Oregon]], to establish a [[leper colony]] for his afflicted people. However, island residents Patrick Malone, Norman Castle, Richard Wayne and David Williams [[Betrayal#Double_cross|double cross]] Blake. During a foggy night, they loot his [[Clipper|clipper ship]] the ''Elizabeth Dane'' and set it on fire, killing all aboard. One hundred and thirty-four years later, the residents of Antonio Island prepare to honor their founding fathersâthe same men who burned the ''Elizabeth Dane''âand a statue of them is to be unveiled on the town's anniversary.   During a boating trip, Nick Castle and his friend Spooner unwittingly disturb a bag containing a [[pocket watch]] and a hairbrush from the ''Elizabeth Dane'' lying on the seabed. That night, Nick meets his former girlfriend, Elizabeth Williams, who has returned after six months. Elizabeth is shown the antique pocket watch by Machen, an old man who found it washed up on the beach. He warns her ominously ''"if you touch it, things will change."'' The watch begins ticking as Elizabeth holds it. She sees a [[hallmark]] on it, which includes a set of scales. Later, weird supernatural occurrences start to plague the town. Objects move by themselves, power outages occur, and the windows in Nick's truck inexplicably shatter. Nick and Elizabeth then encounter drunken priest Father Malone, who is ranting about murderers and retribution. Meanwhile, at the local radio station, host Stevie Wayne gets a phone call from weatherman Dan about a large fog bank off the coast. Out at sea on Nick's boat, Spooner and Nick's cousin Sean are partying with two young women, Mandi and Jennifer. As the fog reaches them, the boat's engine stops, and the instruments break. An old clipper ship appears in the fog next to them. Seemingly possessed, Jennifer draws a set of scales on a misted window inside the boat. Unseen forces then kill Mandi, Jennifer, and Sean. At Nick's beach house, Elizabeth has been dreaming about the ''Elizabeth Dane''. She searches the Internet for information about the hallmark symbol she saw earlier, but her computer malfunctions, and the word "Dane" appears on the screen. She hears a knock at the front door, goes outside but finds nothing. Walking down to the beach, the fog begins approaching, but Nick brings her back inside.  The next day, Nick's Uncle Hank telephones him about the disappearance of his boat. Nick and Elizabeth sail out and find the vessel and the three corpses. Elizabeth goes into the hold and finds Spooner alive in a freezer. They return to the island where Mayor Tom MaloneâFather Malone's fatherâsuspects Spooner of the murders. In the morgue, Sean's corpse briefly rises up and accosts Elizabeth. At the library, Elizabeth researches the scales symbol seen on the watch's hallmark. It represented an old [[Trading post|trading colony]] north of Antonio Island, which was afflicted with leprosy. At the docks, Elizabeth finds the buried journal of Patrick Malone from 1871. She and Nick learn the story of the ''Elizabeth Dane'' and realize the founders built the town with the fortune they had stolen from the ship, but kept this secret from their families and the townsfolk.  The ghosts of the ''Elizabeth Dane'' seek revenge against Antonio Island's residents for the past crimes of its founding fathers. After killing Dan at the weather station, they pursue Stevie's son Andy and his Aunt Connie at home. Connie is killed, but Nick and Elizabeth rescue Andy. In her car, Stevie is also attacked, but she escapes. They travel to the Town Hall where the founders' murderous secrets are exposed. The spirits kill Hank Castle, Kathy Williams and the Malones. The ghost of Blake then seeks Elizabeth. Despite being a descendant of David Williams, Elizabeth is the reincarnation of Blake's wife and was one of her ancestor's victims; hence, her mysterious dreams about the ''Elizabeth Dane''. Blake kisses Elizabeth, and she transforms into a spirit and disappears as Nick watches helplessly. The next day, the survivors try to cope with their traumatic experiences and the truth about their ancestors. As Stevie reflects on the night's events with her listeners, Nick throws Patrick Malone's journal into the sea.  
For Catherine
 Catherine and Duoâs relationship that begins as a satirical inversion of the Hollywood Romantic Comedy paradigm comes to an abrupt Anglican halt when half of the couple leaves to study at Oxford University. Left behind like so many zealots before him, Duo finds a somewhat psychotic comfort in shipping everything he owns to himself. Somewhere between "point A" and "point A", however the parcels, of course, get lost. This is where Travis finds Duo, on the floor of an apartment as stripped as its tenant and, perhaps, as desperate.  Travis and a band of well-meaning compatriots try their best to pick up the sad, silly pieces of their once self-possessed friend and, eventually, lead Duo back to the path of the essentially sane. Unfortunately and inevitably, just as Duo retrieves some measure of direction Catherine returns tossing him back into uncompromising melancholy. Somehow, though, her homecoming also carries illuminations of exactly what love means for at least one member of a seemingly wayward generation.

Four Brothers (film)
 The seemingly random [[murder]] of their adoptive mother, Evelyn Mercer ([[Fionnula Flanagan]]), at a [[Highland Park, Michigan]] [[convenience store]], brings four brothers back home to [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] to find out what happened. Originally under the impression the crime was a simple [[robbery]]-gone-wrong, the brothers soon discover that the robbery was merely a cover for what was, in fact, a [[contract killing|hit]] put out on Evelyn. After this revelation, Bobby ([[Mark Wahlberg]]), Angel ([[Tyrese Gibson]]), Jeremiah ([[AndrÃ© 3000|AndrÃ© Benjamin]]) and Jack Mercer ([[Garrett Hedlund]]) track down the [[hitman|hired guns]] who killed Evelyn. Refusing to say anything, they are unceremoniously executed by Bobby and Angel.  The next day, [[Detroit Police Department|Detroit Police]] Lieutenant Green ([[Terrence Howard]]) and Detective Fowler ([[Josh Charles]]) confront the brothers about the murders. Lieutenant Green warns them that their interference with Evelyn's case is ill-advised, and that it will eventually put them in over their heads. After confronting Jeremiah about the revelation of his failing business and benefiting from Evelyn's life insurance, the brothers are treated to a somewhat different version of events. Jeremiah informs them that his construction company was failing precisely because he was not getting involved with gang lord Victor Sweet ([[Chiwetel Ejiofor]]), and that for a project to succeed he had to pay off the right people, which he initially failed to do. In his effort to restore his business and relieve pressure from himself, he tried to pay off Sweet's henchmen. As for the life insurance, Jeremiah explains that the money went directly to him for his daughters, because he paid all of Evelyn's bills while his other brothers were not around.  Back at their home, during a confrontation with Jeremiah, Sweet's men attack the brothers. Jack is shot and killed during the attack. Bobby finds one of the gunmen still alive and questions him about who sent them. He almost spares the gunman but is offended when the gunman mumbles "Thank God" and kills him anyway. When Lieutenant Green arrives, he tells them not to worry about any legal ramifications, assuring them that it will go down as self-defense. He also informs them that Evelyn filed a police report regarding Victor Sweet and his involvement in Jeremiah's affairs, and his partner, Detective Fowler, passed on that report to Sweet. Green warns the brothers to stay out of the matter and let him handle Fowler and then they will work together on Sweet. Later at a bar Green confronts Fowler, hitting him and ordering Fowler to hand in his badge. They walk out of the bar, and Fowler kills Green and calls it into dispatch claiming two assailants had fired upon Green.  Meanwhile, the remaining brothers devise a plan to buy Victor Sweet off with the $400,000 from their mother's life insurance. When Sweet accepts, Angel sets off for Fowler's. Arriving at Fowler's, he subdues him. Jeremiah then goes to meet Sweet, while Angel's girlfriend, Sofi, heads to the police station, where she tells the police that Angel is planning to kill a police officer. Hearing the sirens in the distance, Fowler thinks they are coming for Angel, until Angel opens his jacket showing a [[covert listening device|wire]]. Angel claims the whole conversation was taped, including Fowler's admission that he killed Green. The police arrive at Fowler's in full force, and Fowler gets the upper hand on Angel. With a gun pointed to Angel's head, Fowler tells the police to back off. Fowler opens fire on the officers outside, who return fire and kill him.  Meanwhile, at frozen over [[Lake St. Clair]], Jeremiah meets with Sweet and reveals that the $400,000 is to buy off Sweet's henchmen, who are already embittered towards him due to his blatant mistreatment of them, and kill Sweet in exchange. Sweet angrily demands to know who will be the one to kill him just as Bobby shows up. Bobby and Sweet [[hand to hand combat|brawl]] for a good five minutes, at the end, Bobby uses his hockey playing skils to get the upper hand and knocks Sweet unconscious. His former henchmen seal his fate after he is dropped in a hole carved into the ice, drowning him. The three brothers, taken into police custody, are [[police brutality|beaten]] in an attempt to make them [[confession (legal)|confess]] to the murder of Victor Sweet, which they do not. Back home, they set about repairing their mother's house, and continuing their lives together.

Fragile (film)
 On the [[Isle of Wight]], a train accident on the [[Island Line, Isle of Wight|Island Line]] means that the main hospital is completely full and unable to take in any more patients. A smaller and older hospital, Mercy Falls, is being closed down, but some of the patients, including the children's ward, need to remain at the site until there is availability elsewhere.  One of the children, Maggie, an orphan suffering from severe [[cystic fibrosis]], tells the night nurse, Susan, that she has seen "her" again, frightening Susan. Another child, Simon, suffers a [[Femoral fracture|broken leg]] and is rushed to the X-ray department. No one knows how his leg broke but as Simon lies on the X-ray table, his femur inexplicably suffers a second fracture.  Susan leaves the hospital on sick leave and Amy Nicholls replaces her. Amy bonds with Maggie as both are orphans. Maggie explains to Amy that there is a girl called Charlotte who lives in the abandoned ward upstairs. Roy, the operations manager, explains to Amy that Charlotte is an urban legend that has been seen by several children over the past two decades. Simon later tells Amy that Charlotte is the one who broke his leg. Amy visits Susan to ask why she left but learns that Susan died in an accident. She meets two local psychics, who explain that Charlotte can only be seen by those who are close to death.  Back at Mercy Falls, the children watch [[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]] and Maggie says that true love's kiss has special power. Amy looks at the files of the other children who'd mentioned Charlotte. All of these children are deceased; Amy realises that Maggie must be close to death. Later, Roy is killed by Charlotte.  Amy goes up to the second floor through a hidden trapdoor and finds an old photograph of a girl in a wheelchair with a nurse, and a film-reel which shows the girl on a medical treatment for [[osteogenesis imperfecta]]. The photograph is labelled "Charlotte and Mandy, 1959." Charlotte begins to materialise and Maggie saves Amy, dropping her favourite blanket in the process. Amy and Dr. Robert view the film and Robert explains the disease Charlotte suffered from was a sickness that causes the patient's bones to be susceptible to fractures. Doctors had built a metal frame for Charlotte to wear that was connected to tubes throughout her body in the hopes of strengthening her bones. Amy now believes Charlotte is the angry ghost of the little girl who is hurting the children. She searches the records but no child called Charlotte existed.  Amy finally learns why the upstairs ward is closed. The nurse caring for the little girl had become obsessed with her. When the treatments began to work and the child improved, [[Factitious disorder imposed on another|she started purposely breaking the girl's bones]] and eventually murdered the child. She then put on the child's metal frame and killed herself. Robert shows Amy a file he found which proves that "Mandy" is the child's name and "Charlotte" is the obsessed nurse. Amy realises that Charlotte wants the children.  The hospital starts falling apart because of Charlotte's rage as the staff desperately try to evacuate the children. As help arrives, Amy realises that everything is suddenly calm, and Mrs. Folder says that Maggie is missing. Amy realises that Maggie went to get her 'Mr Sleepy' and runs to the abandoned ward. Weak and exhausted, Maggie is in Mandy's old room. Despite Charlotte's presence, Amy determinedly picks up Maggie and tries to reach the trapdoor but Charlotte causes the floor to destabilise and Amy's leg is impaled by a piece of metal, causing major bleeding. As the two escape the second floor by jumping through the trapdoor, Maggie succumbs to her illness and stops breathing. Despite Amy's desperate attempts, the little girl dies in her arms. Amy then also collapses from blood loss.  Robert futilely tries to revive her but Amy's heart stops beating. As the medical team step back, we see Maggie's ghost give Amy a pure love kiss and Amy begins to breathe again. The movie ends as Amy wakes up in a different hospital with Robert at her side. An elderly dying man who passes by the door sees Maggie's smiling ghost sitting by Amy's bedside- staying close to what she loved best in life.

In the process they become dangerously close and Anne begins to get wind of Fariba's true identity.  When Siamak's permit of sojourn runs out Fariba gets into arrears with the instalments for her documents. It becomes clear to her that she will never manage things on her own. She risks everything and takes Anne into her confidence. She wants at long last to be able to live as a woman again, to live out her profession, to enjoy big cities.

The world is their oyster.  Just as Fariba is changing out of her Siamak disguise Uwe and the clique turn up in Anne's flat. Uwe demands an explanation. The row escalates. The noisy dispute leads to Fariba's downfall. During the routine check on account of disturbance of the falsified passport falls into the hands of the police. The system which she believed she had outwitted takes its relentless grip. Fariba knows: this is the end, her hopes are shattered. Anne has to watch on helplessly as Fariba is put under arrest.

When Edward arrives there, he discovers that he has been stripped of his alchemical powers and his newly restored arm and leg.  Two years later, in [[Munich]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], Edward researches [[rocket]]ry with his friend Alfons Heiderich, a young man who resembles Alphonse, in the hopes of returning to his world. Edward rescues a persecuted [[Romani people|Romani]] woman named Noah from being sold. Noah is taken in by Edward to live with him and Alfons, and begins having visions concerning Edward's life in his world. The next day, Edward meets [[Fritz Lang]], a [[Jews|Jewish]] film director resembling [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#King Bradley|King Bradley]], who persuades Edward into helping him hunt down a dragon he has been seeking for inspiration for his next film. The dragon, which turns out to be homunculus [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Envy|Envy]], attacks Edward, but is then weakened and captured by members of the [[Thule Society]].  The Thule Society, led by [[Karl Haushofer]] and Dietlinde Eckhart, use Envy and Edward's kidnapped father [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Van Hohenheim|Hohenheim]] as catalysts to open a portal to Edward's world, believing it to be the utopia [[Shambhala|Shamballa]] after learning about it from Hohenheim. A number of armored soldiers are sent through the portal, only to emerge on the other side in the city of Liore as mutated zombie-like creatures. Alphonse, who is visiting Liore, fights off the armored soldiers and merges parts of his soul to three of their suits to aid him in combat. Meanwhile, Edward breaks into the Thule Society headquarters and accidentally reopens the portal, returning the dead armored soldiers to Earth and allowing Alphonse's armored form to briefly reunite with his brother before his soul returns to his body, increasing Edward's determination to return to his world.  Alphonse is guided by the homunculus [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Wrath|Wrath]] to the underground city beneath Amestris' Central City to reopen the Gate of Alchemy. There, they are attacked by the homunculus [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Gluttony|Gluttony]], who fights and mortally wounds Wrath. At Wrath's insistence, Alphonse transmutes and sacrifices the two homunculi to use as material to open the Gate. Meanwhile, in Munich, the Thule Society persuades Noah into guiding them on how to correctly open the Gate based on what she had learned from reading Edward's mind. Edward learns from Lang that the Thule Society plans to use the weapons from his world to help [[Adolf Hitler]] in his [[Beer Hall Putsch|attempt to start a revolution]], and heads to stop them. Hohenheim and Envy are both transmuted at the same time that Alphonse transmutes Gluttony and Wrath. With the Gate opened, Eckhart leads a fleet into the other world, where she gains the ability to use alchemy. However, she begins to go mad with power and fear of her new surroundings and launches an attack on Central City. Alfons launches Edward in a rocket-powered plane to return him to his world before being gunned down.  Edward appears in his world, reunited with Alphonse and their friend [[Winry Rockbell]], who fits Edward with new automail limbs. The Amestris military manages to stop most of Eckhart's soldiers with the help of [[Roy Mustang]]. Edward battles Eckhart before Alphonse transmutes parts of his soul to a group of armors, which attack her and force her to retreat. Upon reappearing in her own world, Eckhart is covered with shadow creatures from the Gate and killed by an officer out of alarm of her new, monstrous appearance. Understanding the danger posed by the connection between the two worlds, Edward returns to Earth to seal the Gate on the other side, knowing he will be trapped there forever. Instead of sealing the Gate on the other world's side as per Edward's request, however, Alphonse has Mustang seal the Gate and follows Edward to remain with his brother. Following Alfons' funeral, the Elric brothers leave Munich with Noah, intending to close the gate and destroy the weapons meant to be used in Hitler's attack.  
Fun with Dick and Jane (2005 film)
  In the year 2000, Dick Harper ([[Jim Carrey]]) has been promoted to Vice President of Communications for a large media corporation known as Globodyne. The following day, he is on a television program with presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]], who calls Globodyne "perverters of the American dream", claiming it helps the super-rich get even wealthier. As they speak, Globodyne's stock value collapses, rendering all investments â including all the employees' savings and pensions â worthless. Dick arrives home, where his wife Jane ([[TÃ©a Leoni]]) tells him that she quit her job as a travel agent following his promotion to spend more time with the family. Dick breaks the news of the company's failure over dinner. Despite his attempts, Dick is unable to find another job with comparable pay, and within a short time, the family faces bankruptcy.  After accepting the prospect of being poor, Dick and Jane apply for low-paying jobs. Both are unable to keep them, and soon their utilities are cut off, forcing them to sell off personal property to stay afloat. When they are confronted with a 24-hour eviction notice, Dick decides to turn to a life of crime. After several failed robbery attempts, Dick and Jane successfully rob a [[head shop]]. They begin nightly robbing sprees and become more comfortable and professional over time. They soon steal enough money to pay off their debts including their house and car, both of which were about to be repossessed. For one last heist, Dick and Jane plan to rob a local bank. All goes as planned until the Petersons â another couple formerly employed at Globodyne â make an amateurish attempt to rob the same bank. The Petersons are quickly arrested, and the Harpers take advantage of the hysteria to evade police and escape.  After watching news footage of the arrests and other crimes committed by former Globodyne employees, the Harpers decide to cease criminal activity and live a normal life again. Dick, however, discovers that he's about to be [[Indictment|indicted]] for his unwitting role in Globodyne's demise. At a local bar, Dick encounters Frank Bascombe ([[Richard Jenkins]]), the former [[chief financial officer|CFO]] of Globodyne, who is drunk and guilt-ridden. Frank tells Dick the company's crooked CEO Jack McCallister ([[Alec Baldwin]]) diverted all of Globodyne's assets and dumped all of his stock, thus ruining the company and its employees while [[Embezzlement|embezzling]] a $400-million fortune. Frank, who is about to go to prison after a failed attempt to expose McCallister's crimes, has received a $10 million bribe from McCallister in exchange for his silence.  After learning about McCallister's scheme, Dick, Jane and Frank decide to take revenge. Frank tells them McCallister plans to transfer his $400 million in [[bearer bond]]s to an offshore account. Dick and Jane intercept the transfer form inside the bank and substitute a fake form, transferring the funds to an account Frank has established. McCallister notices the account number on the form and demands to have it corrected. Dick confronts McCallister and demands that he sign a blank check. Knowing Dick's threats are empty, McCallister writes him a check for $100 and leaves the bank. Dick tells Jane that was his contingency plan; Jane, an art major in college, can now [[Signature forgery|forge]] McCallister's signature.  The next day, McCallister is mobbed by reporters and former Globodyne employees, all praising him for his generosity. Dick appears, and as McCallister's vice president, hands him a prepared statement, which McCallister reads on live television. McCallister is shocked to announce that he has transferred $400 million to a [[trust fund]] to support Globodyne's defunct pension plan in gratitude to his former employees. Dick, Jane, and Frank lead the cheers from the crowd, while McCallister faces them, unable to expose the trio without revealing his own crimes. A news report later shows Dick and Jane delivering pension fund checks to former Globodyne employees, including the now-imprisoned Petersons, implies that Dick has avoided indictment, while reporting that McCallister's net worth has been reduced to only $2,283.  A year later, Dick's family drives a rusty old [[Volkswagen]] into the sunset. While Billy is teaching his parents Spanish, a [[Bentley]] containing Dick's friend Garth ([[John Michael Higgins]]) approaches. Garth tells Dick he has a new job at a company called [[Enron]].

Game 6
 Nicky Rogan has written several plays and has achieved success.  It's now opening night of his latest effort and everyone around him assure him that this one will be the best yet. But as opening hour approaches, Rogan falls prey to doubts and fears, egged on by another playwright whose last work was trashed by the local newspaper's new drama critic, Steven Schwimmer. He eventually lets those fears drive him to resolve to kill the critic (who he assumes will also trash his play) and he procures a handgun with which to perform the deed.  Instead of attending the play's opening night, Rogan spends time in a bar, accompanied by a lady [[Taxicab|cab driver]] and her grandson; earlier in the evening she misidentified Rogan as a local, small-time hoodlum but he doesn't correct her misidentification.  They watch the most crucial Game 6 of the World Series playoff between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Mets. The Sox have won 3 games and could clinch the title by winning Game 6 but Rogan, a lifelong Sox fan, knows how easily the team can lose when they should win. He spends the evening waiting for the inevitable, even though the Sox are lead most of the time. When the inevitable does occur (due to an unexpected pair of errors at the end of the final inning), he snaps and leaves to take out his rage on the newspaper critic.  Rogan not only finds the critic but sees him in the early stages of deflowering the playwright's daughter. He begins firing wildly and is finally calmed when he learns the critic is equally devastated by the Sox's loss.  They end up together, watching an interminable rerun of the final error on a small television set in the critic's apartment.

Gay Sex in the 70s
  The film opens with a rapid montage of visuals that transport people back to the 1970s in and around Greenwich Village. Driving disco music of the time sets the pace. Using intimate interviews, the story of gay sex in the 1970s develops through characters such as Larry Kramer, Scott Bromley, Barton Benes, and Rodger McFarlane. These characters begin to expand the elements that were visually introduced. They talk about the public sex: the streets, the piers, and the trucks.  This outpouring of sexuality is put into perspective when it is shown what gay life was like before 1969. How the political climate of the time influenced sexual expression. They discuss [[Vietnam]], womenâs rights and especially [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] in 1969. The interviewees explore the experience of âEscaping to New Yorkâ. What some of the reasons they left the cities they had spent their entire lives in were, how things changed after the Sexual Revolution had begun.  New York in the 1970s continued the sexual liberation birthed during the free love movement of the 1960s. Playboy magazine flourished like never before as well as more explicit rival magazines [[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]] and [[Hustler]] , the Broadway show âHairâ, âOh Calcuttaâ and the highly controversial âDionysus in â69â² were produced. There was a bombardment of sexual stimuli.  For the first time in history, gay pornography began receiving widespread attention. But how did pornography compare with actual sex occurring in the seventies? âCouldnât compete â life was a pornographic movieâ Rodger McFarland explains.  Sex had become the great equalizer. Young men of all financial strata and backgrounds met in New York to experience a freedom of sexual expression that hadn't been known since ancient Rome. Just a few years before these same men had assumed that their futures were to be in the suburbs via the marriage altar. They found themselves cruising the streets, frequenting gay bars, having sex everywhere from the privacy of their homes, to the orgiastic atmosphere of the bathhouses, to semi-public sexual meeting places like the trucks and the piers. At some venues such as the Continental Baths on the Upper West Side performers such as Bette Midler wowed towel clad audiences.  Paradise Garage opened its doors. A heaven for young men and women of all colors and gay men, it birthed disco music. Other clubs soon followed â from the famous âStudio 54â², to the infamous âSaintâ. Men danced their nights away in an intoxicating communal brotherhood.  How did drugs fit into all this experimentation? Even though HIV had not yet become a threat, what kinds of STDs were being experienced? What were the challenges of all this available sex? In this new birth control age antibiotics were consumed in ever increasing amounts and as long as you were ready to party for the next weekend in the Pines, that was considered a clinical cure.  By the 1970s Fire Island had become the summer paradise of choice for gay men. People from all over the world flew in to enjoy the outlandish parties, partake of sex on the beach and dance under the moonlight. But as the late 1970s partied on, there came to be talk of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria and some men privately began to wonder âhad they gone too far too fast?â The election of the conservative Republican [[Ronald Reagan]] in [[United States presidential election of 1980|1980]] as well as [[Disco Demolition Night]] which helped bring about the decline of Disco music in the United States and the rise of the [[Religious Right]] in the early 1980s seemed to signal a backlash against the liberal atmosphere of the previous decade and the sexual revolution.  In June 1981, just twelve years after the Stonewall Riots, an article appeared in the New York Times that would soon put the brakes on this unprecedented era of sexual freedom. It was by Dr. Lawrence Altman about an unusual cancer seeming to affect gay men â a cancer that soon came to be known as AIDS. While at first many simply brushed off the new reports and continued to party on by the mid 1980s with the rising death toll it became impossible to ignore and one of the results from the new disease was the New York City Health department closing all of the gay bathhouses in 1985. Community and friendships formed by the energy and sexual freedom gave gay men the ability to bond together and work as a strong, cohesive community. They sounded the first public health alarms and formed groups such as GMHC that have helped and continue to help thousands of men and women living with HIV to this day.  The film returns to the present day, 2004. Our characters explore what they gained from being alive in New York during the brief period of unencumbered sexuality that was life in New York during the 1970s, what the legacy of that time of sexual freedom is and how it continues to affect young people today.

 Chitra ([[Nayantara]]), a medical student and her friends are working on a project about the human brain. She wants to investigate the curious case of Sanjay Ramaswamy ([[Suriya]]), a (former) notable Chennai based businessman, who is reported to have [[anterograde amnesia]]. Her professor denies access to Sanjay's records as it is currently under criminal investigation. Chitra, nonetheless, decides to investigate the matter herself.  Sanjay is introduced as he brutally murders a man. He takes an [[Instant camera|instant picture]] of the man, and writes on it "done". Sanjay has anterograde amnesia; he loses his memory every 15 minutes. Sanjay uses a system of photographs, notes, and tattoos on his body to recover his memory after each cycle. It is revealed that Sanjay is ultimately out to avenge the death of his lover Kalpana ([[Asin]]), and that he is systematically killing the people responsible. His main target is Lakshman ([[Pradeep Rawat (actor)|Pradeep Rawat]]), a gangster and notable socialite in Chennai.  A police inspector ([[Riyaz Khan]]), on the case of the serial murders, tracks Sanjay down to his flat and attacks and makes him unconscious. The inspector finds two diaries where Sanjay has chronicled the events of 2002 and 2003. The film flashes back to 2002 as the inspector reads the diary. Sanjay Ramaswamy is shown as the owner of the Air Voice mobile telephone company. In the course of his business, Sanjay sends his men to meet Kalpana, a struggling model, about putting up a billboard above her apartment. The owner of Kalpana's advertising firm ([[Manobala]]) misinterprets this as a romantic advance, and in view of a possible lucrative Air Voice ad campaign and other benefits, encourages Kalpana to accept the overture. Kalpana thinks of this as an innocent prank that may fetch her better modelling work, and decides to play out the charade as Sanjay's girlfriend. She gives an interview in a magazine citing Sanjay as her lover interest. This irks Sanjay; as soon as Sanjay knows of this matter, he decides to confront Kalpana but falls in love with her on first sight. Thus, he introduces himself as "Manohar". Eventually both of them spend time together and gradually develop a liking towards each other. The diary ends with Sanjay proposing to Kalpana and promising himself that he will reveal himself as Sanjay Ramaswamy if she accepts.  Before the inspector can read the 2003 diary, Sanjay regains consciousness, attacks him and ties him up. He tracks down Lakshman to a college function where Lakshman is the guest of honour. Sanjay took pictures of Lakshman and decides to kill him. He meets Chitra at the function who, after some conversation, decides to befriend him. Later that evening, Sanjay mistakenly attacks and kills one of Lakshman's goons in the parking lot. Lakshman is perplexed and fails to recollect the incident. He decides to find and kill his enemies one by one, but Sanjay is not among them.  In the meantime, Chitra visits Sanjay's flat and finds the inspector, beaten and bound. Chitra finds the two diaries and frees the inspector. She also finds that Lakshman is Sanjay's target. The inspector tells her that Sanjay is a known serial murderer. Sanjay arrives suddenly; he remembers neither of them and chases them out. The inspector is eventually hit and killed by a bus, while Chitra barely escapes, going into a phone booth. Believing Lakshman is in danger, she informs him that Sanjay is after him. Lakshman arrives at Sanjay's flat to kill him. He destroys all the photographs, notes and scratches off Sanjay's tattoos. Satisfied that he has neutralised Sanjay by wiping out any trace that connects back to him, Lakshman leaves. Meanwhile, Sanjay discovers that Chitra had warned Lakshman and goes to her dormitory to kill her, but Chitra calls the police and Sanjay is arrested.  Back in her dormitory, Chitra reads the diaries. The 2003 diary reveals that Kalpana had accepted Sanjay's proposal and ends abruptly. Chitra investigates further, and discovers that Kalpana was travelling to [[Mumbai]] for a modelling assignment by train when she came upon 25 innocent young girls being trafficked to Mumbai. She saves the girls who name Lakshman as the ringleader of the racket. Lakshman kills two girls, who recognised him, and goes in search of Kalpana. His goons break into her apartment and wait for her to return, upon which they give chase and subdue her. Sanjay arrives there to meet Kalpana, but notices the group of men grabbing her, and tries to rescue her. He overpowers them only to discover that Kalpana had disappeared amidst the chaos. He makes it to her room, and upon opening the door, she slowly walks towards him, drenched in sweat. Her last word to him is "Po" (Go), a warning for him to leave, as Sanjay looks down to see she had been stabbed from behind. Sanjay is suddenly aware but Lakshman hits him over the head with an iron rod. Sanjay's last vision was to witness Lakshman brutally murder Kalpana with the iron rod, despite already dying from the knife, and Laksman hitting him in the face with the same weapon, before losing consciousness.  Chitra, now aware of the truth, finds Sanjay in the hospital and tells him the truth. He flies into a rage and he tells her to lead him to Lakshman. Meanwhile, Lakshman's twin brother Ram arrives from [[Kolkata]] to help him pursue Sanjay. Arriving at Lakshman's lair in downtown Chennai, Sanjay confronts all of Lakshman's henchmen and with superior strength, manages to disable them. Finding Lakshman himself, Sanjay fights Lakshman hand-to-hand. However, Lakshman realises that he is no match for Sanjay's strength, so Ram intervenes. As both brothers look alike, Sanjay's memory loss strikes again. Ram, exploiting Sanjay's memory loss, beats him mercilessly. Sanjay lies badly wounded on the floor when he sees a vision of Kalpana. With a sudden burst of last minute strength, and with the encouragement of Chitra, Sanjay overpowers both Lakshman and Ram, and kills them.  While Sanjay drives Chitra back to her dormitory, he stops at a crossing to let young children cross the road. A young girl smiles at him, and he reacts by smiling back at her.

Gie
 Soe Hok Gie grew up in a lower-middle class Chinese Indonesian family in [[Jakarta]]. In his early teens, young Gie had developed a fascination in concepts and idealisms advocated by world class intellectuals. Combined with a fighter's passion, faithfulness to friends, and a heart filled with genuine care for others and for his country, young Gie grew to become intolerant with injustice, and dreamt of an Indonesia that is truly founded on justice, equality, and righteousness. This passion was frequently misunderstood by others. Even Soe's best friends, Tan Tjin Han and Herman Lantang posed the question "What is all this fighting for?" which Soe would calmly respond with his awareness that freedom has a price tag that must be paid. Soe's motto, as written on the movie poster, is translated as "It is better to be singled out than to surrender to hypocrisy".  Soe's teen and college years was spent under the regime of Indonesia's founding father [[Sukarno]], which was characterised with conflict between the military and the [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Indonesian Communist Party (PKI)]]. Soe and his friends insisted that they were politically neutral; and as much as Soe has respect for Sukarno as Indonesia's founding father, Soe detested Sukarno's dictatorship which caused the poor and the oppressed to suffer. Soe was well aware of the social inequality, power abuse, and corruption under the government of Sukarno, and courageously spoke out against it in discussion groups, student unions, and wrote sharp criticisms in the media. Soe also abhorred the fact that too many students appeared to others as advocates of positive change, who in fact were just taking advantage of the political situation to make personal gain. This attracted much sympathy as well as opposition. Many interest groups sought Soe to support their campaigns, while many enemies of Soe jump at any opportunity to intimidate him.  Tan, Soe's childhood friend, had always deeply admired Soe's prudence and courage but lacked that fighter's spirit himself. In their twenties, the boys were reunited again for a short time. Soe finds out that Tan had become seduced and deeply involved with the PKI but was ignorant as to what this implied or what consequences awaited. Soe urges Tan to relinquish his ties with the PKI and hide out, but Tan did not listen.  Soe and his friends spend their leisure time hiking and enjoy nature with the Nature-Loving Students of the University of Indonesia (Mapala UI). Other things they enjoyed doing included watching and analysing movies, attending traditional Indonesian performing arts, and hanging out at parties.

Lorna has returned and planted a rat in The Bakery so the [[health department]] will shut them down, but is discovered by Sarah. A fight ensues, during which Lorna hits a switch that causes a surge of electricity into the oven where the gingerbread man is cooking, animating it.  Amos Cadbury, Lorna's boyfriend, who has gotten tired of waiting outside for her, arrives on the scene. Sarah removes the gingerbread man from the oven, at which point the newly dubbed "Gingerdead Man" leaps up, taunting them.

Amos and Sarah discover and rescue Julia from the freezer. Sarah tells Amos that she thinks the killer cookie is Millard. Lorna waits outside for her father, but discovers only his body sprawled over the hood of his car. She steals his ring and heads back inside, where she triggers a [[Booby trap|tripwire]] that lodges a knife into her forehead, killing her.  Sarah and Amos find Betty and attempt to rescue her from the oven, but the Gingerdead Man locks Sarah in the oven and knocks Amos out with a hammer. Amos recovers, shoots the oven door's lock off, and saves Sarah. Brick returns. The Gingerdead Man gets Amos's pistol and opens fire. Julia and Brick manage to subdue him, and Brick eats the cookie's head. Brick is possessed by the Gingerdead Man. He is pushed into the oven and baked to death.  Several months later, Betty, Sarah, and Amos are having a bake sale to raise money for the hospital, with a little help from two nurses. Two kids ask if they have any gingerbread cookies, and one of the nurses tells them that an older lady stopped by and dropped some off.

The Girl from Monday
 Some time in the future United States, a being from another planet (Abracos) arrives on Earth and takes human form.  In voiceover, Jack Bell (Bill Sage), an advertising executive, explains how his ideas came to bring the "triple M" into power and reduce human beings to mere consumers, pawns of the corporation.  Flash-forwards show his visit to a "gun boutique" to buy a pistol, and a suicide attempt in his car.  The innovative idea Jack contributes to Triple M is that, since sexually active people are the most active consumers, people will record each of their sexual encounters as an economic transaction.  This will increase their desirability rating, their value as sexual commodities, and therefore also their credit rating.  Because of its direct relation to one's credit rating and buying power, insurance policies covering a person's sexual desirability are available.  To give himself an alibi during an action he planned for the counter-revolution, Jack attempts to hook up with his co-worker Cecile ([[Sabrina Lloyd]]) but loses heart, leading the insurance company to investigate why this happened. Jack claims that he has been unable to have successful sex since his wife drowned in the ocean. The insurance agent decides it's not Cecile's fault and her premium remains the same, while Jack's is raised. Meanwhile, the planned counter-revolutionary assault on Triple M headquarters is somehow thwarted, and the counter-revolutionaries go on the run. The news broadcasts claim two people were killed, and the police start a manhunt for the perpetrators.  By chance Cecile meets up with William, teenage leader in the counter-revolution, who takes her to a place where people have sex because it feels good. Cecile is arrested and sentenced to "two years hard labor... teaching high school."  The classes are taught through virtual reality helmets, the students are all legally armed and drugged daily with anti-anxiety medications. Coincidentally, William is one of Cecile's students.  Cecile reads Thoreau's book ''[[Walden]], '' passed secretly to her by William, and is inspired to join the counter-revolution.  Meanwhile, Jack drives to the beach where his wife apparently drowned.  He overdoses on pills and vodka, but loses consciousness before he can shoot himself. William finds him, thinks him dead, and takes the pistol to continue his counter-revolutionary activities.  When Jack regains consciousness he finds the girl from the planet Monday (named after its discoverer, Vincent Monday, explains Jack in voice-over) arising from the water.  He secretes her at home and teaches her how to fit into human society.  The girl calls herself "Nobody;" she has arrived to retrieve an earlier "immigrant" from her planet. Several coincidences and adventures later, including a threesome between Jack, Cecile, and Nobody, a police raid on a dress boutique, and Nobody prostituting herself to Cecile's high school principal to get Cecile released from jail, Nobody is convinced her mission is a failure and she decides to go home.   Jack, it turns out, is also an "immigrant" from that planet, and has tried and failed to go home. They proceed to the ocean, where the girl walks into the water and disappears. Jack says he doesn't know if she made it or not.

Goal! (film)
 Santiago MuÃ±ez is a skilled [[Association football|footballer]]. The son of a gardener who lives in a [[barrio]] section of Los Angeles, Santiago works as a busboy in a Chinese restaurant and helps with his father's gardening business. His ultimate dream is to play [[association football|football]] professionally. Due to his poverty and the fact that he plays solely for a club made up of Hispanics from a local car wash, he feels his chances are slim. Santiago is noticed by Glen Foy, a former [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] player who works as a car mechanic but still has ties to his old team.  Glen arranges to get Santiago a trial (US tryout) with Newcastle United, who recently signed talented new player Gavin Harris. Needing to get to England, Santiago begins to save his money in an old shoe, but his father finds the stash and takes it to buy a truck to allow them to work for themselves, believing that Santiago's dreams are hopeless.  His dream is not lost though, as his grandmother sells off her jewellery to buy him a ticket to England.  Glen warmly welcomes Santiago to his home and takes him to the tryout.  Unfamiliar with the English style, he performs poorly. Glen convinces the team's manager that Santiago needs a month's trial to show his full potential. Santiago does not tell club nurse, Roz Harmison, that he has [[asthma]].  After a month, a jealous teammate crushes Santiago's inhaler before a reserve game.  An asthma flare-up prevents him from being able to run hard, and his coach lets him go.  While on his way to the airport Santiago meets Gavin Harris, who was late to arrive to the team. Harris finds out what has happened and makes Santiago explain it to the manager. The manager allows Santiago to stay, provided he gets treatment for the asthma. Santiago earns a contract for the reserves team and moves in with Gavin. Finally he gets onto the first team as a [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a match against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. There he wins a penalty for Newcastle, which is taken by Gavin winning them the match. Unknown to anyone else in his family, his father watches the match on TV in the USA, and after finally watching his son play, he leaves a proud father.  Despite the victory, the manager informs Santiago that his weakness is that he does not pass the ball off.  That night, he and Gavin go out partying.  A picture of the two winds up in the tabloid ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', causing anger from the manager. At the same time, Santiago's friend, Jamie, suffers a career-ending injury that only causes him additional grief.  Meanwhile, back in Los Angeles, Santiago's father dies of a heart attack.  Devastated, Santiago plans to return home. While in the airport waiting for his flight back to Los Angeles, he decides not to return and reports back to training.  Believing he may not make it to the playing eleven, he goes to [[St James' Park]] and practices till late in the evening, and is informed by the manager that he has been selected to play against [[Liverpool F.C.]].  On match day, Gavin puts Newcastle into the lead.  Before half-time, Liverpool makes a comeback with two goals, from [[Igor BiÅ¡Äan]] and [[Milan BaroÅ¡]].  In the final minutes of injury time, Santiago assists Gavin in scoring the equaliser by finally passing the ball to him, to make it 2â2. However, a draw will not be enough to earn Newcastle a place in next season's [[UEFA Champions League]]. Mere minutes before the end of the game, Gavin is tripped and Newcastle gain a wide [[Direct free kick|free kick]], which Gavin gives to Santiago. Santiago, with the hopes and prayers of the whole city of Newcastle resting on his shoulders, scores, and Newcastle win 3â2.  Glen reveals to Santiago that his grandmother is trying to call.  She mentions that his father ''did'' watch his first match against Fulham, after learning this from a fellow supporter (a cameo by [[Brian Johnson]], lead singer from [[AC/DC]], who was born and raised in Newcastle).  Santiago shouts to Glen that his father saw him play and was proud of him before he died. Glen replies: "He's probably watching you right now." The film happily ends with Santiago shedding tears of joy while embracing his dream.

Good Night, and Good Luck
 Set in 1953, during the early days of television [[broadcast journalism]]. [[Edward R. Murrow]] ([[David Strathairn]]) along with his news team, producer [[Fred Friendly]] ([[George Clooney]]) and reporter [[Joseph Wershba]] ([[Robert Downey, Jr.]]) learn of U.S. Air Force officer [[Milo Radulovich]], who is being forcibly discharged because of family members being known communists, and he refused to denounce them. Interest is piqued when it is found that the compilation of charges at Radulovich's hearing was in a sealed envelope and nobody saw them. Murrow presents the story to CBS News' director, Sig Mickelson ([[Jeff Daniels]]), who warns Murrow that the story will bring serious accusations and repercussions to [[CBS]] and their sponsors, some of whom have government contracts. He reluctantly allows the story to air, which gains positive responses from the public. Murrow also tries to ease the worries of his colleague, [[Don Hollenbeck]] ([[Ray Wise]]), who is struggling with both the strain of his recent divorce and attacks from newspaper writer [[Jack O'Brian]], who is accusing him of being biased in his news reporting and being a "pinko".   Soon after, Wershba's given an envelope suggesting that Murrow has previously interacted with the Soviets and used to be on their payroll. CBS's Chief Executive, [[William S. Paley|William Paley]] ([[Frank Langella]]) brings this forward to Murrow, warning him that if any members of his staff are associated with communism in any way, however remotely, they would have to recuse themselves from Murrow's next story, which is a direct attack on Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] and [[McCarthyism|his crusade]] against Communist infiltration in the U.S. government, which some denounce as a witch hunt. Friendly and Murrow gather their staff together, and when one of the team members voluntarily excuses himself because his ex-wife had attended Communist meetings before they even met, Murrow concludes that this kind of fear is what McCarthy wants. The team stays together and presents the story, which becomes highly praised by the public and the press, with the exception of Jack O'Brian, who continues to attack both Murrow and especially Hollenbeck on their supposed support of Communism. Hollenbeck pleads with Murrow to go after O'Brian, but Murrow reluctantly tells him that he cannot attack O'Brian while he is busy going after McCarthy.  As the team turns their focus to a filmed hearing of [[Annie Lee Moss]], a [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] communication worker accused of being a communist based on her name appearing on a list seen by an [[FBI]] infiltrator of the [[American Communist Party]], they receive the news that Milo Radulovich being reinstated by the Air Force, citing no evidence supporting any connections with Communism. Soon after, McCarthy asks for the opportunity to speak for himself on Murrow's show, which Murrow allows. McCarthy openly accuses Murrow of being a Communist, citing several pieces of evidence that seem to support it. Murrow broadcasts a rebuttal the following week, easily disproving McCarthy's accusations and pointing out that McCarthy didn't do anything to defend himself other than accuse anyone who opposes him as being either a Communist or a Communist sympathizer.   A few days later, the news arrives that the U.S. Senate is investigating McCarthy, which means the imminent end of his crusade. As the team celebrates, Friendly and Murrow learn that Hollenbeck has committed suicide. Soon after, Paley tells Murrow and Friendly that their news program's air time is going to be severely cut, citing the high costs of the show's production, along with Murrow's attacks on controversial topics. Also, Joe Wershba and his wife Shirley, who both have been secretly hiding their marriage, due to CBS forbidding co-workers being married, are approached by Mickelson, who tells them that everyone knows of their marriage and that he will allow one of them to resign to save face, which Joe agrees to do.  The film is [[Framing device|framed]] by performance of the speech given by Murrow to the [[Radio and Television News Directors Association]] at "A Salute to Edward R. Murrow" on October 25, 1958, in which he harshly admonishes his audience not to squander the potential of television to inform and educate the public, so that it does not become only "wires and lights in a box".<ref>Edward R.

The Greatest Game Ever Played
 Set mainly in 1913, the film is about [[Francis Ouimet]], the first amateur to win the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]. Amateur golf in that era was then a sport only for the wealthy, and Ouimet came from an immigrant family that was part of the working class. Ouimet watches an exhibition by legendary British golf pro [[Harry Vardon]] ([[Stephen Dillane]]) as a 7-year-old boy, and becomes very interested in golf. He begins as a [[caddie]] at [[The Country Club]], a posh enclave located across the street from his home in suburban [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], while making friends with the other caddies. He works on his own golf game at every chance, and gradually accumulates his own set of clubs. Francis practices putting at night in his room. He wins the Massachusetts Schoolboy Championship.  One day, a Club member, Mr. Hastings, asks Ouimet to play with him over The Country Club course, where caddies have almost no access of their own, and he shoots a fine round of 81 despite a 9 on one hole. His talent, composure, and good manners earn admirers and interest. With the help of Mr. Hastings and the Club Caddiemaster, Francis gets a chance to play in an upcoming tournament, the [[U.S. Amateur]], the local qualifying for which is to be held at the very same Country Club course. However, his father Arthur ([[Elias Koteas]]) tells his son to quit golf and get a "real job". Ouimet needs $50 for the entry fee, and so agrees to get a real job and never play golf again if he could not qualify; his father lends him the money. On the 18th, Francis faces a three-foot putt that would secure him a spot in the championship, but he looks over and his father is watching. Ouimet is distracted, misses and falls one stroke short of qualifying for the championship proper.  With much jeer from the rich folk, Ouimet, now 20, fulfills his promise to his dad and works at a sporting goods shop, while continuing to live at home. After some time with his golf forgotten, Ouimet is still at the bottom of the working class. But one day, the president of the [[United States Golf Association]] enters the store and personally invites him to play in the upcoming U.S. Open. After some maneuvering and consideration from his employer, Ouimet secures entry. His father informs Ouimet that he must find his own place to live after the tournament and Ouimet agrees to this arrangement. However, his mother has been supportive of his golf from the start. She admonishes Ouimet's father for not recognizing Ouimet's talent and that he now has a chance to show demonstrate it in an important tournament.  Ouimet competes in the 1913 U.S. Open that takes place at [[The Country Club]] in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], the familiar course located across the street from his home. The favorites are British champions Vardon and [[Ted Ray (golfer)|Ted Ray]], who are accompanied by the snobbish [[Lord Northcliffe]] ([[Peter Firth]]), and the reigning U.S. Open champion, [[John McDermott (golfer)|John McDermott]]. Northcliffe looks to see that either Vardon or Ray wins the Open, to affirm British dominance over the Americans in golf, and also to prove that only gentlemen were able champions. Ouimet competes with his 10-year old friend, [[Eddie Lowery]] ([[Josh Flitter]]), who skips school to caddie for Ouimet. After the first two rounds, Vardon and Ray have a seemingly comfortable lead, with McDermott unable to keep up. After some initial struggles, Ouimet rallies back and ends up tying with Vardon and Ray at the end of the third round, meaning that the three of them would compete in an 18-hole playoff to determine the champion. The night before, Northcliffe mocks Ouimet's social status to Vardon, who came from humble beginnings himself, and Vardon finally tells Northcliffe that he is going to try to win only for his own pride, not Britain's and that if Ouimet wins, it will be because of his own skill, not his background.  The playoff round commences, with all three competitors keeping it close until the final holes, where Ray fades out, and Ouimet ahead of Vardon by a stroke going into the final hole. Vardon finishes with a par, giving Ouimet the chance to clinch the win with a par himself. Seeing him become nervous before the final putt, Eddie calms him down, and Ouimet is able to make the putt and win the U.S. Open. As the crowd carries him and Eddie on their shoulders, they start to hand him money. Ouimet refuses it all, only accepting one bill from his now proud father. In the clubhouse, Vardon privately congratulates Ouimet and suggests that they should play a friendly round together in the future. Ouimet and Eddie then walk home, carrying the U.S. Open trophy.

Matt accepts the money and uses it to visit his sister Shannon ([[Claire Forlani]]), her husband Steve ([[Marc Warren]]) and their young son Ben in London. There, Matt meets Steve's brother, Pete ([[Charlie Hunnam]]) who leads the local football hooligan firm â Green Street Elite (GSE). Steve asks Pete to take Matt to a football match. Though Pete is reluctant to take a "[[Yankee|Yank]]" to a [[association football|football]] match, he decides to take Matt to the game, thinking he might "learn something."  Matt meets Pete's friends and his firm in their local pub and they befriend Matt, with the exception of Pete's stubborn right-hand man, Bovver. A few pints in and they head to the match. Afterward, Pete, Bovver, and the other firm members go off to fight some Birmingham fans, but Matt decides that it is not for him and heads to the train home. On his way back, Matt is jumped by three Birmingham fans but is rescued by some GSE members. Though grossly outnumbered, the GSE manage to stand their ground until reinforcements chase off the Birmingham firm.

Jealous of Matt's rise in the ranks, Bovver talks to Tommy Hatcher ([[Geoff Bell (actor)|Geoff Bell]]), the head of GSE's rival firm; the NTO. After one of the members of the GSE sees Matt meeting his father, a journalist for ''[[The Times]]'', for lunch, they assume Matt is a "journo" as well. Bovver informs Pete of this, and Steve goes to the Abbey to warn Matt, discovering that Steve is the founder and former leader of the GSE; âThe Major", who retired from football hooliganism after witnessing the death of Tommyâs 12-year-old son in a fight.  Pete angrily confronts Matt in the bathroom over his identity as a "journo" right before the Millwall firm then crash the Abbey and petrol-bomb the bar.

 On the surface of [[Mars]], the [[Mars Rover]] is destroyed by an unknown force. Astronomer George Herbert (Howell) and his wife Felicity (Van Wyk Loots) are packing for a trip to [[Washington D.C.]] to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary. George's son Alex tries to spot Mars through his telescope, but actually discovers a meteorite entering Earth's atmosphere. George is called to work about the incident, and his wife and son leave early for Washington without him. As he drives to work, a crashing meteorite disrupts all technology in the area. An [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|alien]] "[[Tripod (War of the Worlds)|walker]]" emerges from the meteorite and massacres the witnesses with an [[Heat-Ray|energy weapon]], George barely escaping with his life. George decides to meet with his younger brother Matt in Hopewell before moving on to D.C..  Despite rumours that D.C. has suffered some of the worst of the invasion thus far, George continues his journey and meets with Sgt. Kerry Williams, the last remaining member of his squad. George and Kerry meet with Lt. Samuelson, a power-mad soldier with unrealistic notions of resistance against the invaders, who rejects George and Kerry as cowards. In Hopewell, the aliens launch a heavy insurrection and George and Kerry find Matt dying in the trail of destruction. George is separated from Kerry in the confusion and escapes the attack. A Pastor, Victor, finds George and describes his belief that the invasion is a form of the [[Rapture]]. The two go on together towards D.C.. Victor's faith in Christianity is deeply shaken when a hysterical former member of his church curses God for the death of her young children. George and Victor witness the final effort of the military to fight off the walkers who are overwhelmed as the aliens begin using [[Black smoke|chemical weapons]] to disperse their opposition.  The two seek refuge in the abandoned house of a veterinarian for food and medical supplies when the neighborhood is flattened by another of the aliens' ships. Hiding in the house's ruins deep in the aliens' camp, Victor concludes that God has abandoned them, and rejects his religion altogether. Rations become sparse and the aliens begin harvesting humans. George finds rabies vaccines with the hope that it can spread among the aliens and give them a chance to escape. Victor regains his faith after George successfully infects one of the aliens, only for it to kill Victor and leave. George realizes after a few days that the aliens have left the area and he continues his journey on foot to Washington D.C.. George reunites with Kerry and Samuelson, who has made himself a general and is building a resistance under his own dictatorship. Samuelson senselessly murders Kerry, and George in turn murders Samuelson.  George finally reaches Washington, which is completely destroyed. He offers his life to the aliens, but finds that they are all dead. A handful of human survivors emerge and reveal to George that the aliens have been dying from a virus. George finds Felicity and Alex alive.  
H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds (Hines film)
 The early part of the film follows the experience of a late 19th-century journalist from Woking, known as "the writer", involved with the landing of a Martian invasion spacecraft. When the crashed cylinder opens, the Martians start killing anything that moves with a "heat ray" weapon. The writer discovers his house is in range of their heat ray and decides to rush his wife and servant to her cousins' home in Leatherhead; once there, he returns in order to return the borrowed cart to its owner, unaware that the invading Martians are now on the move.  The Martians have built tall tripod "fighting machines" and begun a destructive rampage across southern England.

When the writer tries to get back to his wife in Leatherhead, he is confounded and beset by many problems as a result of the chaos brought by the Martian invasion.  
Guy X
 It is 1979, four years after the end of US involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].  US Army Corporal Rudy Spruance is mistakenly sent to Qangattarsa, a remote base in [[Greenland]] still attributed to the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (despite that service being converted to the [[United States Air Force]] in 1947), instead of his official posting in [[Hawaii]]. He soon finds out that his records have accidentally been replaced by the records of a Corporal Martin Pederson, who has been sent to Hawaii.  The base is manned by a co-ed battalion of US Army misfits, many of whom have been stationed there for over five years, doing little more than drink and sex their way through the overwhelming boredom.  The only apparent military duty is to unload and reload a supply plane every couple of months. The base has been commanded for many years by the near-insane Lt. Col. L. G. Woolwrap, supported by his Aide of three years, SFC Irene Teal, his erstwhile girlfriend. Teal points out that it does not make much difference who he really is, nor where he is based, as it all just functions as service time.  Working under the name Pederson, as the base's new Public Information Officer, Spruance starts an intimate and personal relationship with Teal.  While exploring he finds out that underneath the base is a secret and highly classified hospital ward.  The ward houses the last six surviving, unnamed (other than letters, including W, X, Y, Z), brain dead and very physically damaged soldiers from a secret Vietnam War mission in October 1973.  When Spruance/Pederson stumbles upon the ward, he develops a rapport with "Guy X", who has lucid moments that no one else knows about.  Spruance sleuths out that then-Col. Woolwrap had been the leader of the mission, and has been in command of the [[palliative care]] base ever since &ndash; having signed the letters to the families of the ward patients stating that they had died in combat and that their bodies were irretrievable. On one of his clandestine visits to the ward, Spruance meets an unnamed plainclothes operative from the [[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]], who confirms that the soldiers are "classified loose ends, and exercise in patience", as they wait for them to die.    Guy X dictates a letter to Spruance, for the wife of one of his men.  Spruance sneaks the letter out on the next supply plane. The letter has an impact as some weeks later, at the height of the 24 hour darkness of the [[winter solstice]], the Army orders a sudden and rapid shutdown of the base due to "compromised security". The same mysterious operative appears, telling Spruance by name (as they have clarified his identity) that the remaining "Guys" will be disposed of (in an undescribed way).  Spruance and Teal find Guy X under his bed in the otherwise abandoned ward, and answer his request to see the outside world before he dies. Just as Guy X dies in the snow, Woolwrap finds them and tells Spruance and Teal that he will not abandon his men, killing himself with his sidearm.  The two just make it to the last evacuation plane, where his friend Cpl Lavone informs them that he has created official paperwork giving them new names and ranks (similar to the original Spruance/Pederson mixup). As the plane flies away from Greenland, "General" Lavone asks the small group which base, in which (warm) country, they wish to have designated in their "new" orders.

Gurozuka
 In Japan, a school's movie club was shut down when one member disappeared and another was hospitalized after suffering a nervous breakdown. Seven years later, two students, Maki and Ai, restart the club with the intention of making a horror film based on the events that led to the organization's closure. Three other girls (Natsuki, Yayoi, and Yuka) join the club, and they, Maki and Ai are taken to a secluded lodge called the Yuai House by Maki's sister Yoko, a teacher and former club member, who has brought along the awkward Takako.  Once everyone has set up at the Yuai House, Maki and Ai show the other girls an old [[8 mm video format|8mm]] tape Maki found while cleaning out the club room at the school. The video, titled ''Gurozuka'', is set at the lodge, and depicts someone wearing a [[Noh]] mask killing their co-star with a meat cleaver. The students debate over whether the murder shown on the tape was real, and the next day the car fails to start, and all the food, cell phones, and wallets disappear, along with the Noh mask and cleaver that were going to be used in the film project.  When night falls, Natsuki disappears, and Takako and Yuka are non-fatally poisoned, prompting Yoko to leave in search of aid. In the morning, Ai looks over footage shot by Natsuki, which shows her being assaulted by someone wearing the Noh mask. Ai runs outside and finds Maki, who claims to have seen the masked woman just moments ago. The two then find all the missing food dumped in the woods, along with the Noh mask and now bloodied cleaver. The girls return to the house, and discover Takako and Yayoi are gone, so they go in search of them along with a recovered Yuka, soon stumbling onto the bodies of Natsuki and Yayoi. The trio returns to the lodge (where Takako has been hiding) and decide to hold out until the morning. A bloodied Yoko appears banging on the door, begging for help, moments before the Noh-masked figure breaks in.  Ai is chased outside by the killer, and finds Yuka's corpse, and a delusional and dying Takako. The murderer catches up to Ai, and pulls off the Deigan mask to reveal she is Maki. Maki explains that after finding the ''Gurozuka'' tape she became obsessed with it, and that it made her want to kill. Ai escapes, and Maki gives chase to her once again, after stabbing Yoko in the head. When Maki finds Ai, she professes her love for her, and then claims she is going to cannibalize her body to become her. Before Maki can make the killing blow, Maki stabs her in the chest with a nail the two had earlier found stuck in a tree.  Ai wakes up at the Yuai House, and joins Yoko (who she had found alive, and saved) in watching ''Gurozuka'', which Yoko muses seems to drive people insane. When Ai tries to destroy the tape, Yoko grabs her, and repeats Maki's line "You're such a good girl. I want to be you, Ai."

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)
   [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] awakens from a nightmare wherein [[Frank Bryce]] is killed after overhearing [[Lord Voldemort]] conspiring with [[Death Eater#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] and another man. Harry attends the [[Quidditch]] World Cup between [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Bulgaria]] with the [[Weasleys]]. After the game, [[Death Eaters]] terrorise the camp, and the man who appeared in Harry's dream summons the [[Dark Mark]].  At [[Hogwarts]], [[Albus Dumbledore]] introduces ex-[[Auror]] [[Alastor Moody|Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody]] as the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher. He also announces that the school will host the legendary event known as the [[Triwizard Tournament]], in which three magical schools compete by facing three dangerous challenges. The [[Goblet of Fire]] selects "champions" to take part in the competition: [[Cedric Diggory]] of [[Hufflepuff]] representing Hogwarts, [[Viktor Krum]] representing the [[Durmstrang Institute]] from [[Central Europe]], and [[Fleur Delacour]] representing [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]] from [[France]]. The Goblet unexpectedly chooses a fourth champion: Harry Potter. Dumbledore cannot pull the underage Harry out of the tournament, as Ministry official [[Barty Crouch Sr.]] insists that after being selected, the champions are bound by a contract.  For the first task, each champion must retrieve a golden egg guarded by a [[dragon]]. Harry succeeds in retrieving the egg, which contains information about the second challenge. Shortly after, another event known as the [[Yule Ball]], a formal dance takes place; Harry's crush [[Cho Chang]] attends with Cedric, and [[Hermione Granger]] attends with Viktor, making Ron jealous. During the second task, the champions must dive underwater to rescue their mates. Harry comes out in third place, but is placed second behind Cedric due to his "moral fibre" after saving Fleur's sister Gabrielle as well as Ron. Afterwards, Harry discovers the corpse of Barty Crouch Sr. in the forest. Later, while waiting for Dumbledore in his office, Harry discovers a [[Pensieve]], which holds Dumbledore's memories. Harry witnesses a trial in which [[Igor Karkaroff]], Durmstrang Institute's Headmaster, confesses to the [[Ministry of Magic]] names of other Death Eaters, after Voldemort's defeat. When he names [[Severus Snape]] as one, Dumbledore vouches for Snape's innocence; Snape turned spy against Voldemort before the latter's downfall. As Karkaroff names Barty Crouch Jr., a devastated Barty Crouch Sr. imprisons his son in [[Azkaban]]. Exiting the Pensieve, Harry realises the man he saw in his dream is Barty Crouch Jr.  For the final task, the champions enter a [[hedge maze]], and must reach the Triwizard Cup. Viktor, under the influence of the Imperius Curse, incapacitates Fleur. After Harry saves Cedric when the maze attacks him, the two claim a draw and together grab the cup, which turns out to be a [[Portkey]] and transports them to a graveyard where Pettigrew and Voldemort are waiting. Pettigrew kills Cedric with the Killing Curse and performs a ritual that rejuvenates Voldemort, who then summons the Death Eaters. Voldemort releases Harry in order to beat him in a duel to prove he is the better wizard. Unable to defend himself, Harry tries the Expelliarmus charm at the same moment that Voldemort attempts the Killing Curse. The beams from their wands entwine, and Voldemort's wand disgorges the last spells it performed. The spirits of the people he murdered materialise in the graveyard, including [[Lily and James Potter|Harry's parents]] and Cedric. Voldemort and his Death Eaters are distracted, allowing Harry to escape with Cedric's body by grabbing the Portkey.  Harry tells Dumbledore that Voldemort returned and killed Cedric. Moody takes Harry back to his office to interrogate him about Lord Voldemort, inadvertently blowing his cover when he asks Harry whether there were "others in the graveyard" though Harry never mentioned a graveyard. Moody reveals that he submitted Harry's name to the Goblet of Fire and manipulated Harry throughout the tournament to ensure he would win. Moody attempts to attack Harry, but Dumbledore, Snape, and Minerva McGonagall intervene and subdue him. The teachers force Moody to drink Veritaserum, a truth-telling potion, and he reveals that the real Moody is imprisoned in a magical trunk. The false Moody's [[Polyjuice Potion]] wears off, revealing him as Barty Crouch Jr. Crouch Jr. is returned to Azkaban.  Dumbledore reveals to the students that Voldemort killed Cedric, although the Ministry of Magic opposes the revelation. Later Dumbledore visits Harry in his dormitory, apologising to him for the dangers he endured. Harry reveals that he saw his parents in the graveyard; Dumbledore names this effect as "[[Priori Incantatem]]". Soon after Hogwarts, Durmstrang, and Beauxbatons bid farewell to each other.

Before he can, Jeff gets dizzy, his vision blurs, and he falls to the floor unconscious.  When Jeff wakes, he is bound to a chair. Hayley explains she has been tracking him and drugged him because she knows he is a [[pedophile]], rapist, and murderer. Jeff denies these allegations, claiming he had innocent intentions. Hayley searches Jeff's house and finds his gun and safe. In the safe, Hayley finds "sick" pictures and a photo of Donna Mauer, a local girl who has been kidnapped and remains missing. Jeff denies involvement in Mauer's disappearance and succeeds in reaching his gun, but when he (still bound to the chair) attacks Hayley, she renders him unconscious by asphyxiating him with plastic wrap.  When Jeff wakes, he finds himself bound to a steel table with a bag of ice on his genitals. Hayley explains  she will [[Castration|castrate]] Jeff. Jeff threatens, bribes and sweet-talks Hayley to dissuade her; when that doesn't work, he tries to get her sympathy by telling her he was abused as a child. Following the supposed operation, which Jeff does not feel due to the ice numbing his genitals, Hayley leaves the kitchen, claiming to take a shower. Jeff struggles and frees himself. When he reluctantly checks the site of the operation, he realizes he is actually unharmed, and Hayley has elaborately faked his castration. He storms off in a rage to get Hayley in the bathroom, where the shower is running. Scalpel in hand, he attacks, only to find the shower empty. Hayley attacks him from behind, and as they struggle, Hayley incapacitates him with a stun gun.  Hayley poses as a police officer and asks Jeff's ex-girlfriend, Janelle, to come immediately to Jeff's house. Jeff regains consciousness to find that Hayley has bound his wrists and hoisted him to stand on a chair in his kitchen with a [[noose]] around his neck.  Hayley makes Jeff an offer: if he commits suicide, she promises to erase the evidence of his crimes, but if he refuses, she promises to expose his secrets. The conversation is interrupted when a neighbor knocks on the front door, selling Girl Scout cookies. Hayley tells the neighbor that she is Jeff's niece; the neighbor leaves shortly afterwards. When Hayley returns, Jeff breaks free from his bindings and pursues her, eventually finding her on the roof of his house, where she has lured him. Hayley has brought her rope from the kitchen and fashioned it into a noose secured to the chimney. Hayley keeps Jeff at bay with his own gun.  Jeff finally confesses that he watched while another man raped and murdered Donna Mauer. Jeff promises Hayley that, if she spares his life, he will tell her the other man's name so she can exact her revenge. Hayley confesses that she knows his name and says, "Aaron told me ''you'' did it before he killed himself." Janelle arrives, and Hayley once again urges Jeff to hang himself, promising that she will destroy the evidence. Defeated, Jeff lets Hayley slide the noose around his neck, and takes the last fatal step off the roof; after he falls Hayley says "or not". Hayley then gathers her belongings and escapes through the woods. The film ends as Hayley walks down the road in her red hoodie.

With this in mind, Jim returns to [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]].  In Los Angeles, Jim meets up with his best friend Mike Alonzo ([[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]]). Mike's longtime girlfriend, Sylvia ([[Eva Longoria]]), a young attorney, is "on the warpath" over his failure to get a job (his previous job was [[outsourcing|outsourced]]) and she encourages Jim to help Mike hand out resumes.  After being denied a position in the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] for failing the psychological profile, Jim gets drunk with Mike, forgetting all about the resumes.  The two go to visit Jim's ex-girlfriend, but when her current boyfriend shows up, a fight ensues in which the boyfriend is backed up by a group of friends. Jim is able to get the upper hand and when Mike produces a gun, they subdue the men and rob them of their possessions, including [[marijuana]] and a [[handgun]] which they later decide to sell. Jim later leaves messages on Mike's answering machine with several different voices, pretending to be companies responding to his resume.   The next day, when Jim goes to visit Mike, he finds Sylvia in a surprisingly good mood due to the callbacks. Jim and Mike end up wasting the day again, getting a friend of theirs to leave another message on Mike's answering machine. They then go to a "paisa" bar to try to sell the gun, but leave after their potential buyer is stabbed in the neck and killed. Mike is horrified, but Jim is strangely excited by witnessing death again.  When Mike arrives back home drunk, Sylvia is upset, so Mike plays back the [[answering machine]], unaware that his friend didn't hang up early enough and his voice is heard on the tape. Sylvia is enraged and throws Mike out of the house. He goes and stays at Jim's place. Jim gets shortlisted for a position with the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), and after cheating on a [[urine test]], it appears that he is going to be given a position.    Jim manages to pass the urinalysis test, but subsequently fails a [[polygraph]] test due to a question about his drug use. The only hope left for him is a government agent working out of [[Colombia]], who appreciates Jim's ability to "get things done"; Jim eventually accepts the position but is warned that he must not get married to a foreigner; his security clearance might be revoked. Jim is told to report to [[FLETC]] in a few days. Meanwhile, Mike gets a job when a company he applies at is now managed by an old friend.  Jim goes to visit Marta along with Mike and another one of their friends, but before they leave, Mike goes to visit Sylvia and tells her that he has a job for real. She calms down and the two make love. Impatient, Jim goes inside and tells Sylvia that Mike is coming to Mexico with him for the weekend, as it is their last chance to hang out. Sylvia is angry and very much against the idea, and so Jim yells at both her and Mike. Mike decides to go with Jim to Mexico.  The trio arrive in Mexico, where they spend a relaxing night and morning the next day, preparing for a big party that night. At the party, Marta reveals that she is pregnant, and Jim responds violently, threatening to punch her in the stomach and shoot her in the head; in the end, this is a result of Jim's severe PTSD.  On the way back, Jim reveals that he is transporting 20 kilos of marijuana, much to Mike's dismay. When Mike protests, Jim pulls a gun on him, flashing back, before breaking down in tears, horrified at what he is becoming. Mike, filled with pity for his friend, agrees to accompany Jim to the deal after all. When they arrive to sell the drugs, they realize one of the buyers was the same man they had earlier robbed and beaten, the boyfriend of Jim's old flame.   Hostility ensues with both Jim and the other gang members pulling out guns, resulting in the other man's death. The other members of the buying party present plead for their lives, but Jim kills them while suffering flashbacks due to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. While Jim and Mike are escaping in the car, a man from inside the house steps out and shoots at the car with an [[Armsel Striker]]; Jim is hit in the back and the side of his face, and subsequently [[paralysis|paralyzed]].   He urges Mike to "step up" and shoot him, thus ending his suffering. After some hesitation, Mike and Jim say their goodbyes and Mike ends up killing Jim. The film ends with Mike returning to Sylvia, who was in the process of packing her belongings to leave for good. They embrace together as Mike breaks down crying.  
Hasami Otoko

She was also stabbed in the neck with a pair of scissors in a copycat murder.  The film follows several different plot strands, including the psychological condition of the woman and her relationship with the man, the background of the student who was killed in the copycat murder, and the police hunt for the murderers.  It emerges that the female murderer has a split personality, and the man she is seen with is actually a vision of her dead father caused by her guilt over his suicide when she was younger. The copycat murderer was the police psychological profiler, who had been having an affair with the high school student.  By the end of the film the psychological profiler is dead, and the police blame him for all three murders. The real scissors murderer has a final vision of her father, in which he tells her that he always loved her and she was not to blame for his death. She is then free to be happy.  
Hate Crime (2005 film)
 Robbie Levinson ([[Seth Peterson]]) and Trey McCoy ([[Brian J. Smith]]) are an [[openly gay]] couple living in a suburban home near friend and next-door neighbor Kathleen Slansky ([[Lin Shaye]]). The couple plans to hold a commitment ceremony to exchange rings. Trey's mother, Barbara ([[Cindy Pickett]]), suggests to Trey, who suggests to Robbie, that the couple consider raising a child.  When Chris Boyd ([[Chad Donella]]) arrives next-door with a moving truck with friend Alton Kachim (Luke King), they disgustedly watch Trey kiss a nervous Robbie. Alton annoys Chris with his [[homophobia|homophobic]] jokes, and suggests they "do something about it." Chris makes unprovoked, threatening remarks toward Robbie, telling Robbie he will "go to hell" and warns him to âwatch his back." Chris is a youth pastor and the son of Pastor Boyd ([[Bruce Davison]]) who vehemently condemns homosexuality. Chris delivers Robbie his church's pamphlet after Kathleen refuses it and threatens retaliation should Chris get involved. Robbie subsequently learns of the church and Pastor Boyd, who is angered to learn Chris has long been estranged from his presumed daughter-in-law.  While walking his Boston Terrier, Trey is brutally attacked with a baseball bat and is taken to a hospital, where he falls into a coma. Under criminal investigation, the Boyd family conspires to agree on Chris' alibi. Robbie commits to a child, but Trey soon suffers severe brain hemorrhage and dies, having never awakened since the attack. Robbie dons himself and Trey with their commitment rings at Trey's viewing.  The investigation is transferred to homicide Detective Esposito ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]), who asks Robbie if he killed Trey, pointing out his insurance policy and the fact that Robbieâs were the only set of fingerprints on the bat. Robbie is arrested and given a [[restraining order]] for assaulting Chris after a failed attempt to get a surreptitiously tape-recorded confession from Chris. Esposito moves to make a case against him.  Robbie enters Chris' home and finds gay porn in his internet bookmarks. Pastor Boyd confronts Chris with a private investigatorâs photographs of Chris meeting for anonymous gay sex on multiple occasions, and it is revealed that Chris was meeting one of his lovers on the night of the murder. Detective Fisher (Farah White) contacts Alton, who surmises that Chris killed Trey, because he phoned his parents' home and he was not there. Pastor Boyd confronts his son and confesses to murdering Trey. Robbie tape-records Pastor Boyd confessing to the murder and turns the tape over to Esposito.  Esposito refuses to move against the pastor and confiscates the tape, but Barbara recovers it. Chris contemplates [[suicide]], yet refuses to testify against his father; he does, however, leave Robbie his father's gun.  Robbie, Kathleen, and Barbara conspire and execute a plan to kill Pastor Boyd in a disguised break-in to retrieve the tape-recording.

Havoc (2005 film)
 The film begins in a parking lot in which a teenage filmmaker named Eric is attempting to document the [[Wigger|faux-gangsta]] lifestyle enjoyed by Allison Lang ([[Anne Hathaway]]) and her boyfriend Toby's ([[Mike Vogel]]) gang of white upper-class teenagers living in the [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] neighborhood. A brawl ensues between Toby's gang and another gang, which ends with both sides fleeing just before police arrive. Later that night, Toby's gang goes to a party at Eric's house, and Allison's relationship with Toby as well her other friends Emily  and Sam is further revealed. At the end of the party, Allison performs oral sex on her boyfriend.  The next day, Allison meets with her father, Stuart, at work to discuss family problems, the awkward conversation revealing the virtually non-existent relationship Allison has with her parents. Afterwards, she and her friends drive downtown into East LA, intent on buying marijuana, eventually encountering Mexican drug dealer Hector and his crew. Toby and Hector make a deal, but Toby believes that Hector did not sell him enough for what he paid, and attempts to confront Hector, who pulls a gun on him, humiliating him in front of his friends. Allison persuades Hector to leave Toby alone.  The next night, Allison and her girlfriends return to the location of the drug deal. There, she and her friends once again meet up with Hector and his crew, who invite them to a party at his house. Before they leave, Hector informs Allison of a motel where his crew regularly party, and invites her to stop by if she wishes. The next day, Eric continues his film project at Allison's home, with Allison turning his interview of her into a bizarre mind-game. That evening, Allison meets up with Hector again in a store, and he shows her around his neighborhood, while talking about his family and lifestyle. His guided tour abruptly ends when the police arrive in force, ostensibly on a drug bust. Allison winds up being arrested with the other present gang members, but â save for an argument with her parents and Toby â is let off the hook. The experience only serves to increase Allison's fascination with the inner-city lifestyle. The night after her release, Allison and Emily agree to head downtown the next evening to hang out with Hector's crew.  The two meet up with Hector and his gang at a motel, and a night of partying and drinking results in Allison and Emily asking Hector if they can join his crew. Hector informs them of their initiation; to join the gang, the two must roll a dice; the number they roll corresponds to the number of gang members they must have sex with. Allison rolls a one, Emily rolls a three. Hector and Allison pair off, but Allison has second thoughts and refuses to have sex with him, and is thrown out of the room by the gang when she tries to get Emily to leave with her. Emily eagerly engages in sex with Hector, but as she does so, Hector has one of his fellow gang members rape her anally. When Allison storms the room and screams at the men to stop, they flee the room, leaving the two distraught women.  The next day, Allison returns to the motel and confronts Hector over the previous night, but he responds by saying he didn't do anything wrong, that he only did what she and Emily asked him to do. At that moment, a woman shows up at the door, surprising Allison, much to the amusement of Hector, who mocks Allison for thinking he had feelings for her, and calling her a poser who only knows how to play games and nothing about the realities of gang life. The same day, Emily is shown at a police station, accusing Hector and his crew of gang rape. Allison is brought in for questioning, but claims to know nothing about a rape. Hector is subsequently arrested, and members of his crew vow to seek out and silence Allison and Emily, but wind up getting lost in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel-Air]]. Meanwhile, Toby and his gang are shown posing with guns in front of Eric and his video camera, making clear their intent on seeking revenge on Hector's crew. Eric later shows Allison the footage, and Allison subsequently calls Toby and makes an ill-fated attempt to convince him that there was no rape and what he is doing is foolish.  Allison informs Emily of what Toby plans to do, and reveals to Emily's parents the events at the motel. This initially upsets Emily to the point of nearly attempting suicide, but eventually the two reconcile. Meanwhile, Toby and his gang arrive at Hector's motel and bust in violently, but only succeed in frightening a group of Latino women and a baby. Toby tries to work up the nerve to shoot them, but, consumed by their desperate pleas to not hurt the baby, realizes he can't and storms out. On their drive home, the gang passes the [[SUV]] containing the members of Hector's crew that had been looking for Allison and Emily. The two gangs exchange looks, and the screen subsequently fades to black. After a few seconds the sounds of tires squealing, people shouting and gunfire are heard.  Eric concludes his film with Allison saying that teens will be teens, but if adults are willing to reach out to them to connect and give them even just a small amount of insight, it's like they suddenly know everything.

In flashbacks to an early age, he lost his mother and his brother Edmund. Later, he lived through the [[Nazi]] occupation of his homeland, [[Poland]] during [[World War II]] and post war [[Communism]]. Through all these hardships, he maintained his love for [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]] and the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|virgin Mary]].  He became an ordained priest, and eventually [[Krakow]]'s [[archbishop]], where he began his fight against [[Communism]] and its oppression. On October 16, 1978, Karol Wojtyla became the 264th pope of the Roman Catholic Church, and now called himself John Paul II.  The "Polish Pope" himself made history with the third longest papacy ever. He made his triumphant papal return to Poland in June, 1979, confronted [[liberation theology]], survived the assassination attempt on himself in 1981 by [[Mehmet Ali Agca]] (who he later forgave in 1983) and used his influence to help bring both Communist and right-wing totalitarian regimes, such as Alfredo Stroessner's dictatorship in Paraguay, to their knees. Afterwards, he expressed distress over [[materialism]] and unprincipled capitalism in his native Poland and denounced the [[sexual abuse]] of children that was brought to his attention in 2002, saying that "every sin can be forgiven, but by God, not by me".  On 2 April 2005, Pope John Paul II died.

Haunting Sarah
 Erica and Heather Rose ([[Kim Raver]]) are identical twins who share a bond that becomes stronger as they grow up. As adults, their lives have had many parallels: They both have successful careers (Erica is an author and teacher and Heather is a doctor) and both are happily married and loving mothers to seven-year-old children.  Erica's daughter Sarah ([[Niamh Wilson]]) and Heather's son David grow up sharing an equally close bond, but David is struck by a car and dies. Erica anguishes over how she might be able to explain to Sarah that David is dead, but the bond between the two children seems to extend past the grave, as Sarah reveals that David has already told her he is gone. At school, Sarah hurts a boy from her class when he makes a negative comment about David. When her parents pick her up, Sarah nervously tells them that she doesn't want them to drive over Creek Bridge. Later, they find out there was an accident on that bridge and Sarah had drawn a picture of it because David had told her to. That day, Sarah's nanny, Rosie, notices that the girl has a strange bruise on the back of her neck.  Erica and her husband Edgar decide that Erica and Sarah should go stay at the family's country house to help Sarah forget about David. In the city, Heather is still in grief so she decides to drive out to the country house to join her sister. Rosie finds out that Sarah is still in contact with David and gives her a friendship bracelet to protect her. Rosie tells Erica she thinks the bruises may be from David's spirit looking to cross back over, holding onto the neck of a living person, which she refers to as 'hanting.' During the night, Erica, Heather and Rosie run to Sarah's room at her screams and see that her wrist is swollen and bloody, as if someone was trying to rip the bracelet off. Rosie is apprehensive as she senses that David might be a danger to Sarah. The twins however disregard her warnings and decide it would be best to have Rosie leave because of her beliefs, wary they might be impacting Sarah. As Heather drops off Rosie the next morning, Rosie begs her to at least place the talisman bracelet she'd made before under Sarah's pillow or bed, in order to help protect Sarah. Heather agrees, yet the moment Rosie leaves she chucks it out of the car window. Rosie, unawares of her action, yet feels a chill. Heather and Sarah start building a dollhouse as a memorial for David but don't tell Erica that is its purpose. Erica surprisingly finds out she is 12 weeks pregnant, after Sarah mysteriously mentions her having a baby, and is put on bed rest. She again says David told her. Erica starts getting jealous because Sarah spends a lot of time with Heather building the dollhouse, but eventually calms down when she sees how beautiful it is; she apologises to both for being so neurotic. Later, Edgar shows Erica a house he put an offer on. The strange thing is that it's an exact replica of the dollhouse. They move in, although Erica does so reluctantly as she cannot explain how the dollhouse can be an almost exact replica of the house, or how Sarah could've known.  Three months later, Sarah is still acting strangely: she never has an appetite, is always tired and doesn't make any friends at the new school. Concerned, Erica takes her to the psychologist, who notices the bruises on her neck and wants to call social services, thinking Erica might be hurting her own daughter. However, Heather (a colleague) talks her out of it. When Heather mentions it to Erica, the latter freaks out and tells her sister to leave; accusing her that Heather believes Eric'a baby might be David's reincarnation. Outside, as she leaves Heather sees Sarah holding a sign to the window saying "HE'S MAD". When Erica asks Sarah if she knows how she got the bruises or what is wrong, Sarah shows Erica the toy figure on her shelf that had belonged to David (it had fallen on the street, which was why he ran back and got struck by the car that killed him). Erica, surprised to find it there, throws it in the bin to which Sarah says "You shouldn't have done that!". Erica looks up 'Hanting', reading that the host's life force is drained by the Hant and the host then slips into a coma and dies. Erica rushes to the school for Sarah but finds out that Heather impersonated her and picked Sarah up earlier. Erica eventually finds Sarah and Heather with another colleague of Heather's who's a hypnotist. They are talking to Sarah, but calling her David, who is repeatedly shouting "I want to be born now, I want to be born NOW!". Sarah suddenly attacks Erica, lunge/pounce/flying at her neck, screaming "You are not my mother. You bitch!". Once they manage to pry Sarah off her, and the hypnotist calls Sarah back into her body, Heather explains that she only wanted to talk to David (& that Erica would do the same in her shoes) but Erica punches her and storms out with Sarah.  Erica calls Rosie back after seeing the increasing strong bruises on Sarah's neck and now back. Rosie explains that David is hanging on to Sarah, buying time while waiting for Erica's baby to be born so that he can take its body and be reborn. They get rid of everything that belonged to David. Erica finds the dollhouse down in the basement and Rosie says that it is no wonder David has been so strong; he had been given an invite and a place/home of his own to live in, that the dollhouse was a "spirit-house". Erica burns down the dollhouse and Sarah throws the last picture she has of David into the flames, finally accepting the death of her friend. That night, Erica realises they hadn't burned everything of David's; the toy she had thrown away is still in Sarah's room. She and Edgar hurry to Sarah and find her on the top story window ledge. Sarah says that David tells her it won't hurt, then jumps off the roof crashing to the floor below. She is rushed to hospital and the doctor explains that she suffered severe head trauma and is in a coma. Erica senses her sisters distress and visits them at the hospital. She decides that they should give David what he wants in order to save Sarah. Heather injects Erica with a medication that will induce the birth of the baby. Erica gives birth to a baby girl, much to everyone's surprise. But then starts having more contractions; after an emergency C-section, Erica has a healthy second baby â a boy. At the same moment the boy starts to cry, Sarah opens her eyes, showing that David has let go of her. Heather takes the boy in her arms and looks at him lovingly.  One year later, at their Halloween party, the family seems to be happy and Sarah is in good health. Erica has finally published her new book about twin studies. A red devils mask creeps up to baby boy Jack's crib â as the mask is removed, the audience sees it's Sarah. She says: "Hello David. Now, I'm the one in charge", as she smiles menacingly.

Hell (2005 film)
 The film is set in [[Paris]] and is about three sisters: Celine, Anne and Sophie. It starts with a scene in which a woman and her young daughter (who we later find out is Celine) walk into an office and see two people: her father, and a young man who is naked.  After Sebastian has met Celine a few times much later in their adulthood, following a misunderstanding in which she strips for him as she believes him to be an admirer, he confides to her that he was the young man, and that her father's imprisonment for this crime was actually his fault. He said that he had fallen in love with her father and, finally being alone with him and not knowing what else to do, took off his clothes.  It is revealed that the girls' father tried to see his daughters on his release from prison when they were young. He broke into his ex-wife's apartment and locked her in the kitchen to try to see his daughters and attempts to see them, but they, having been told by their mother what their father has done, have locked themselves in their bedroom. The mother breaks out of the kitchen and he assaults her, leaving her with a brain injury and an inability to speak. He then jumps from the window, killing himself.  In the present day, Anne has an affair with a man who is both the father of her best friend and a Sorbonne professor, by whom she becomes pregnant (while the professor is still married). Sophie's marriage falls apart as her husband has an affair.  Celine contacts her sisters, whom she has not seen for some time even though all three live in Paris, and explains the truth of her father's innocence as revealed by Sebastian. They visit their mother in her beautiful aged care home, and explain that their father's conviction was a mistake, and she was wrong to vilify him. She replies by writing 'I have no regrets', implying an ulterior motive in denouncing her then-husband. The audience is left wondering if he cheated on her, long ago, and thus each of the four women share a tortured history of men in their lives.  
The Heart of the Game
 The film begins two years before African-American Darnellia Russell attends the predominantly white and upper-class [[Roosevelt High School (Seattle)|Roosevelt High School]]. Bill Resler, a tax law professor at the [[University of Washington]], becomes their new girls basketball coach. Resler, a coach who uses animal and nature themes to motivate his team, believes they can win the Washington State championship but they fall short in the first game of the state tournament.  A couple of years later, Russell attends Roosevelt High School where she makes the junior-varsity team. Learning of her natural talent, Resler recruits her for the varsity squad. In the following years, the talented Roosevelt team falls short of winning the state championship in close games. Russell receives letters of interest from several major universities. However, after her junior year, she becomes pregnant by her longtime boyfriend and drops out of school.  After giving birth to a daughter, Russell returns to Roosevelt for her fifth year. However, the WIAA (Washington Interscholastic Activities Association) bans her from playing basketball due to a rule that states that high school students can only play on their teams for four years, unless a hardship is involved. Russell, believing that having an unplanned child constitutes a hardship, appeals the decision. Attorney Ken Luce, located in Tacoma, Washington, represents her in court and a judge rules in Russell's favor. The WIAA takes the matter to court again, and for the second time the judge grants Russell the right to continue playing. However, the WIAA files a lawsuit against Russell and Roosevelt High School. In defiance of the WIAA, the Roughriders continue to play with Russell on the team.  Russell and her team return to the Washington State high school basketball championship tournament and play rivals, the [[Garfield High School (Seattle, Washington)|Garfield Bulldogs]] in the finals. She leads the team to the school's first state championship. Two days later, the WIAA dropped their case. Russell graduates from high school with honors and is named the Northwest Player of the Year.  Although Russell didn't receive any college scholarships, she attended [[North Seattle Community College]].  
Heaven's Soldiers
 The film begins with high-level military leaders from both [[North Korea|North]] and South Korea discussing the surrender of a North Korean 50&nbsp;Mt nuclear warhead () in a secret underground development bunker near the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]].  The warhead was secretly jointly-designed, but international pressure has forced North and South Korea to hand over the device and close the facility.  North Korean officer Major Kang Min-gil ([[Kim Seung-woo]]), displeased with the conciliation of the Koreas, steals the warhead with the help of several of his loyal soldiers. The leaders of both sides dispatch a South Korean special forces platoon under the leadership of Major Park Jung-woo ([[Hwang Jung-min]]).  The platoon intercepts the rebellious Kang and his squad by boat and begin a firefight. However, in the middle of the conflict, a comet travels dangerously close to Earth - and this causes a "time rift" linking the present with other points in the comet's 433-year cycle of close approaches to the Earth. Three modern Korean men from each side (and one female scientist, Dr. Kim Su-yeon ([[Gong Hyo-jin]]), kidnapped along with the warhead) unintentionally find themselves time traveling back from 2005 to 1572, and wind up in the middle of a skirmish between [[Joseon]]-era Koreans and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] invaders.  After some confusion, a grenade blast routs the Jurchens, and the soldiers immediately wind up with the nickname "Heavenly Soldiers" due to their 'magical' abilities.   The modern Koreans also meet with a regional foreigner who turns out to be none other than the young version of [[Yi Sun-sin]] ([[Park Joong-hoon]]), the legendary admiral who later becomes instrumental in the defeat of the later [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592â98)|Japanese invasion]]. However, this "General" Yi acts like nothing like either of the modern Korean histories illustrate him: he is a petty thief and [[ginseng]] smuggler who just failed his military [[Gwageo]] exam, and seeing no future for himself, has turned to crime in order to survive. Yi also stole and hid the group's small arms shortly after their arrival. Unfortunately, a little peasant girl caught him burying the weapons and later retrieves one of the handguns, whereupon she is caught by two Jurchen spies sent to look for the "Heavenly Soldiers".  With nothing better to do other than try to fix history, Major Park attempts to train Yi in the military skills he was so known for, while Major Kang and his men search the area for the nuclear device, which has gone missing during their transit. Not understanding their motivations, Yi is highly resistant to the modern Koreans' attempt to change his lowly lifestyle until he ends up captured by the Jurchens, who are aware of his association with the "Heavenly Soldiers" and attempt to make him lead them to the Koreans by killing the peasant girl. The North Koreans stumble upon Yi and free him, and also find the warhead in the tent of one of the war leaders. However, Kang is forced to kill the son of a war leader sleeping in the same tent, and in retaliation the Jurchens initiate movement to violently root out the modern Koreans.  With the warhead back in their possession, and the timing and location of the comet's overhead passing accurately calculated by Dr. Kim, the "Heavenly Soldiers" prepare to leave the past as it currently stands. Yi, incensed by the barbarians' cruelty, returns to the modern Koreans with their weapons and the elders of the girl's village, who plead with the "Heavenly Soldiers" to help them, and the modern Koreans relent. When Majors Park and Kang debate over the strategy that would work best for the villagers, Yi, beginning to find his legendary tactical competence, successfully argues for a combination of ambushes and a last stand.  That night, before the arrival of the Jurchens, the modern Koreans prepare to leave the past, as the comet would unexpectedly perigee later the next day. When Park advises Yi to save his life as well, Yi protests but is knocked out and carried off. Kang, who knows he will be hunted down as soon as he returns to the present, elects to go back to the village to help defend it from the Jurchens; the other modern Koreans stay behind for their own reasons as well. Meanwhile, the stubborn Yi manages to escape his confinement and joins the "Heavenly Soldiers" and the villagers in their battle against the Jurchens. The invaders are defeated after a long and bloody engagement, but out of the modern soldiers only Park and North Korean sergeant Choi survive alongside Yi. Dr. Kim and the warhead make it back to the present, where she reports their experiences to the Korean generals. But despite her appeals to honor the sacrifice the men have made to preserve Korea's present and future, her superiors decide to turn over the warhead.  In the final scene, Dr. Kim visits a local memorial to the still-venerated Admiral Yi. The scene switches to the opening sequence of the [[Battle of Myeongnyang|Battle of Myeongnyang Strait]], the legendary sea battle where Yi and only 13 Korean ships successfully destroyed an over 300-strong Japanese armada. Aboard his flagship, Yi delivers a rousing speech of encouragement to his men and then gives the order to charge into battle, with Park and Choi by his side as his staff officers.  
The Heirloom
 The film begins with the description of an obscure occult practice in which people feed aborted [[fetus]]es blood to raise 'young ghosts'. These ghosts become powerful and bring fortune to families but at the same time can be commanded to bring death.

Herbie: Fully Loaded
 Maggie Peyton (Lohan) is an aspiring race car driver. Maggie's family includes her brother, Ray Jr., and her father, Ray Sr., who are members of their namesake's racing team. [[Herbie]], a [[Volkswagen Beetle]], is towed to a junkyard after losing several races, and Ray Sr. takes Maggie to the junkyard to buy her a car as a college graduation present. After Maggie selects Herbie, she finds an anonymous note in Herbie's glove box, possibly written by Herbie's old owner Jim Douglas (Herbie's original owner from ''[[The Love Bug]]'' (1968) and ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'') which reads: "''Please take care of Herbie. Whatever your problem, he'll help you find the answer''". Herbie takes her against her will to the garage where her old friend Kevin works as a mechanic. Kevin has Maggie take Herbie to a car show to buy parts for Herbie, but when they arrive, Herbie tricks Maggie into disguising herself in a racing suit and helmet and challenging [[NASCAR]] champion Trip Murphy to an important race, which Herbie wins by a second.  This delights Kevin, who tries to talk Maggie into racing again. However, Ray Sr., who has forbidden her from racing since she was hospitalized after a [[street racing]] accident years ago, is concerned. It also infuriates Trip, who becomes obsessed with Herbie. Trip organizes a local street-racing competition to lure Herbie back for a rematch, which Maggie and Kevin enter. Herbie easily defeats the other cars and qualifies for the final match with Trip, but when Trip talks Maggie into [[racing for pinks]] (where the winner takes possession of the opponent's car), Herbie becomes alarmed over Maggie's desire to win Trip's [[stock car]]. In addition to being deeply hurt by Maggie's earlier assertion that driving in Tripâs car was the best ride of her life, Herbie incorrectly assumes that Maggie will reject him if she wins the other car, and also is unaware that Trip only agreed to the match so that he could have Herbie scrapped if he got possession of him. Consequently, Herbie intentionally loses the race against Trip Corvette C6 Z06 causing Maggie to be humiliated, Herbie being towed away by Trip, Kevin being disappointed in Maggie, and Ray Sr. lecturing Maggie for racing without his permission.  However, encouraged by her friend Charisma, Maggie decides to race professionally.  She tries to buy Herbie back from Trip, but Trip has entered Herbie in a [[demolition derby]]. Desperate to save Herbie from destruction, Maggie goes to the derby, runs onto the field while the derby is in progress, pleads with Herbie to help her, and wins the derby.  Meanwhile, Team Peyton may have to forfeit an upcoming stock-car race due to financial troubles and two crashes by Ray Jr., one of which leaves him with a depth perception problem, rendering him unable to race. Ray Sr. declines Maggie's offer to drive for the team, but Ray Jr. allows her to take his place and sends the Team Peyton crew to help her and Kevin prepare Herbie for the race.  At the race track, Maggie and Herbie have a heart-to-heart conversation, and Trip ominously warns Maggie that the race will be dangerous.  Herbie starts the race slowly, but he eventually catches up and begins passing the other cars before Maggie makes her first pit stop.  While watching the race at home, Ray Sr. decides to watch the race in person.  On the track again, Herbie is soon boxed in by some other cars, but Ray Sr. arrives at the track and encourages Maggie over the team radio, and Maggie escapes the trap by driving directly over Tony Stewart who was in front of her.  This damages Herbie's oil system, so Maggie makes another pit stop and Kevin hurriedly extracts a replacement part from a yellow [[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]], which Herbie has been eyeing amorously throughout the film, owned by Sally, one of Team Peyton's few remaining sponsors, switiching it with Herbie's. The jerry-rigged oil system is fragile, and Trip is intent on preventing Herbie from winning.  With Maggie, Herbie, and Ray Sr. now working together, Maggie and Herbie catch up to Trip. Trip tries to damage Herbie by pushing him into the track wall when Maggie tries to pass him, but he is caught off guard and crashes into the wall when she slams on the brakes during his next attempt, causing Trip's car to ricochet off the wall and hit Jeff Gordon's car, flipping his over. Herbie passes Trip's car, now upside down on the track, by climbing onto the catch fence above the wall and riding it all the way to the finish line.  After landing back on the track, Maggie and Herbie win the race. Maggie is congratulated by her father and brother, and Trip is hospitalized as Maggie and Kevin kiss. Later, Ray Sr. warns Herbie and Sally's New Beetle not to stay out too long on their date. Herbie and his love then drive off into the night, ending the movie and rolling the credits.

 Reporter Amy Klein ([[Kari Wuhrer]]) is sent to [[Bucharest]] at the behest of her boss, Charles ([[Simon Kunz]]), to investigate a videotape depicting the ritualistic murder - and subsequent [[Undead|reanimation]] - of a member of a cult calling themselves "the Deaders". Amy tracks down the return address of the tape and discovers the corpse of its sender, Marla, holding the [[Lament Configuration]]. She returns to her hotel and opens the box, triggering an apparent dream in which she summons [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]] ([[Doug Bradley]]). Amy delves into Bucharest's subculture and meets Joey, who warns her about the Deaders and notices that Amy has a 'self destructive thing'.   Amy pursues leads, ultimately tracking down Winter LeMarchand ([[Paul Rhys]]), the leader of the cult. Winter, as the descendant of the toymaker who designed the puzzle box, believes he is destined to access the realm of the [[Cenobites]] and become their master. Unable to open the box himself, Winter believes that only an individual exhibiting trauma-induced [[nihilism]] can open the box. To this end, he founded the Deaders and attracted emotionally vulnerable followers so that he could kill them and reanimate them. Winter does this to Amy, resulting in her experiencing an extended [[waking dream]] in which she relives her father's [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse|sexual]] abuse and her subsequent murder of him as a child.  Coming back to the living world, Amy successfully opens the box and summons the Cenobites. Pinhead expresses disdain for Winter and his family, denying that any mortal could ever control the Cenobites. He proceeds to slaughter the Deaders before indicating to Amy that she is now indebted to them by opening the box, saying that her father has been waiting for her in [[Hell]]. Rather than be taken, Amy kills herself, resulting in the box closing and sending out an electrical charge that banishes the Cenobites back to Hell and causes the Deaders' compound to explode. Later, Charles, unaware of Amy's whereabouts, assigns a new female journalist to investigate the tape. The film ends with the reporter holding up the puzzle box, which has been recovered from the destroyed compound.

As the party progresses, Allison, Derrick and Mike find themselves trapped in separate parts of the house, and are gruesomely killed by the Host, [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]], or Cenobite minions Chatterer II and Bound. Jake and Chelsea become mysteriously invisible to other party guests, and are stalked by the Host and the Cenobites.  Holing herself up in the attic, Chelsea finds items belonging to Adam, and discovers that the host is his father, who blames his son's friends for not helping break his addiction. Chelsea and Jake try to flee, only to discover that they have been buried alive and are receiving messages from the host via cell phones in their respective caskets. The Host informs them that they are just coming out of a hallucination induced by a powerful [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] he exposed them to upon their arrival, and that the events they have been experiencing have been the result of hypnotic suggestion and their own guilty consciences. Before leaving, he lets Chelsea know that Allison, Derrick, and Mike have all perished in their respective caskets, and that only she and Jake remain alive. Chelsea begins to slip into another hallucination when she is abruptly pulled above ground by police and paramedics, who say they were informed by a phone call from Chelsea's telephone. Looking towards the house, Chelsea sees Adam standing in the window.  Later, the Host sits in a bedroom, going through a suitcase containing Adam's possessions. He finds and opens the actual Lament Configuration, which summons the real Cenobites. Pinhead praises Adam's ingenuity and mocks the Host's disbelief before Chatterer and Bound tear him to pieces.

Suddenly, a Vogon Constructor Fleet appears in the sky and destroys the planet. Ford saves himself and Arthur by stowing away on a Vogon ship. When discovered, they are thrown out of an airlock, but are picked up by the starship [[Technology in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Heart of Gold|Heart of Gold]]. They find Ford's "semi-cousin" [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]], the President of the Galaxy. He has stolen the ship along with [[Trillian (character)|Tricia "Trillian" McMillan]], an Earth woman whom Arthur had met previously, and [[Marvin the Paranoid Android]], a [[Major depressive disorder|clinically depressed]] robot that constantly complains about life.

As they are leaving the planet, Trillian is captured by Vogons. The others travel to rescue her from the Vogon home world bureaucracy, facing long lines and frustrating form processing.

Slartibartfast takes Arthur to a recreation of his home on the new Earth, where the others are enjoying a feast provided by the [[Interdimensional being|pan-dimensional beings]] who commissioned Arthur's original Earth, and who resemble a pair of mice. The mice, who constructed Deep Thought, used the supercomputer to build an even larger supercomputer, the planet Earth, to determine the Ultimate Question. Believing Arthur, the last remaining supercomputer component, may hold the Ultimate Question, the mice restrain Arthur in order remove his brain. Initially panicking, a resigned Arthur futilely attempts to dissuade them from doing so, admitting that the only question that ever mattered to him was whether Trillian was "the one", the answer to which Arthur realises is "yes". But the mice continue, unconvinced, believing Arthur's Question to be "Tripe", and wanting to be famous rather than happy. Arthur panics again, but, as his survival insincts kick in, Arthur breaks free of his restraints and squashes the mice under a teapot. The mice, returning to their original forms, disappear into thin air, never to be seen again  Outside the house, the group is then confronted by Vogons, who open fire. As the group takes shelter, Marvin is left outside and, despite being shot in the back of the head, recovers and uses the Point-of-View gun on the Vogons, causing them to become depressed and unable to fight.

Hide and Seek (2005 film)
  Following his discovery of the body of his wife ([[Amy Irving]]) in a bathtub after her apparent suicide, Dr. David Callaway ([[Robert De Niro]]), a psychologist working in New York City, decides to move with his 9-year-old daughter Emily ([[Dakota Fanning]]) to [[Upstate New York]]. There, Emily makes an apparently imaginary friend she calls "Charlie". Her friendship with Charlie begins to disturb David when he discovers their cat dead in the bathtub, who, Emily claims, was a victim of "Charlie". Meanwhile, David has nightmares of the New Year's Eve party that occurred the night before his wife died.  When a family friend, Dr. Katherine Carson ([[Famke Janssen]]), comes to visit David and Emily, Emily reveals that she and Charlie have a mutual desire to upset her father. Soon, they meet Laura ([[Melissa Leo]]) and Stephen ([[Robert John Burke]]) who are their neighbors. David is wary of their unusual interest in Emily. He later discovers that the reason for this is that the couple had a daughter who recently died from cancer and looked like Emily. Later, when David visits Laura, she nervously and ambiguously implies that her husband has begun abusing her in response to their child's death, emotionally and perhaps physically.  David meets Elizabeth Young ([[Elisabeth Shue]]), a local woman, and her niece, Amy, who is roughly the same age as Emily. Hoping to cultivate a new, healthy friendship for Emily, David sets up a play date for her. Amy is anxious to become friends immediately, but the play date is spoiled when Emily cuts up Amy's doll's face. After Amy runs out of the house, Emily tells David that she doesn't need any more friends.  Despite the unsuccessful play date, David and Elizabeth hit it off. David invites her over to dinner one night, where Emily acts increasingly hostile towards her. Some time later, Elizabeth visits the house, hoping to make peace with Emily. When Emily tells her that she is playing hide-and-seek with Charlie, Elizabeth indulges her by pretending to look for Charlie. When she opens the closet, someone bursts out and pushes Elizabeth out a second-story window to her death.  After the police discover her car crashed near David's house, David asks Emily what happened. Emily claims Charlie caused her death by pushing her out the window and forced Emily to help him move the body. She tells David the location of her body. A terrified David discovers Elizabeth's body in the bathroom in a bathtub full of blood. David asks Emily where Charlie is, and Emily tells him that Charlie has "just left".  David, armed with a knife, goes outside, where he meets the neighbor who has become friends with Emily. David assumes that his neighbor is Charlie and begins to act aggressively. Becoming suspicious that David has killed his own daughter, the neighbor asks to see Emily, but David cuts the neighbor with his knife. The neighbor then calls the police.  Back in the house, David finds that, although he has been in his study many times (listening to his stereo and writing a journal), the boxes were actually never unpacked after the move. With this, David realizes that he has [[dissociative identity disorder]] and that Charlie is not imaginary at all, but that in fact "Charlie" is David himself. Whenever "Charlie" would emerge, David was in his study. Charlie was actually in control. David also realizes that under his Charlie personality, he killed his wife and then made it appear to be a suicide. He also fully recalls the events of the New Year's Eve party the night before his wife's death. Immediately after the countdown to midnight, David noticed his wife slip away. He followed her and caught her in a stairwell making out with another guest. "Charlie" was created as a way for David's rage to murder his wife, something that the docile David himself was too decent to do. Emily knew the entire time about her father's split personality, but did not tell him because she was unsure which personality murdered her mother, suspecting David until "Charlie" killed Elizabeth.   Once Charlie's identity and horrible deeds are realized to David, he becomes completely consumed by Charlie, leading him to murder the local sheriff ([[Dylan Baker]]), who arrives to investigate the previous altercation. Emily calls Katherine for help.  Katherine arrives and is pushed down the basement stairs by 'Charlie'.

Hitch (film)
 Alex "Hitch" Hitchens ([[Will Smith]]) is a professional "date doctor" who coaches other men in the art of wooing women, with a focus on long-term relationships. He is very successful at what he does. While coaching one of his clients, Albert Brennaman ([[Kevin James]]) - who is smitten with a client of his investment firm, [[celebrity]] Allegra Cole ([[Amber Valletta]]) - Hitch finds himself falling for Sara Melas ([[Eva Mendes]]). Sara is a gossip columnist and workaholic. While Albert and Allegra's relationship continues to progress, Hitch finds it difficult to initiate a dialogue with Sara, finding that none of his romantic methods is working on her. Throughout the entire process, he keeps his career secret, claiming to be a generic "consultant."  Hitch meets with Vance Munson ([[Jeffrey Donovan]]), a shallow [[Male chauvinism|chauvinist]] attempting to enlist Hitch to help him land a one-night stand with Casey Sedgewick ([[Julie Ann Emery]]), Sara's coworker and best friend. Although Hitch refuses to help, Vance misleads Sara into believing that he has used Hitch's services.   After finding out Hitch's true identity, Sara publishes an [[investigative journalism|exposÃ©]], causing Allegra and Albert to break up and Hitch's reputation to suffer. At a [[speed dating]] cafe that Hitch sneaks into, Sara and Casey confront Hitch and cite Vance as their source. Hitch explains that not only did he refuse to work with him - Vance's personality type is why women protect themselves - but that same protection also unintentionally made establishing genuine relationships difficult enough to create a demand for Hitch's services.  Hitch then tries to salvage Albert and Allegra's relationship. He confronts Allegra, and realizes that he doesn't really do anything significant besides giving his clients confidence and allowing them to get the attention of the women, and that most of his customers, particularly Albert, really were successful just being themselves.  Allegra reconciles with Albert. The film ends with Albert and Allegra getting married as well as Hitch and Sara resuming their relationship.  
A History of Violence
 Tom Stall is a diner owner who lives in the small town of Millbrook, [[Indiana]], with a loving wife Edie, teenage son Jack, and daughter Sarah. One night, two men attempt to rob the restaurant. When a waitress is threatened, Tom deftly kills both robbers with surprising skill and precision. He is hailed as a hero by his family and the townspeople, and the incident makes him a local celebrity. Tom is visited by scarred gangster Carl Fogarty, who alleges that Tom is actually a gangster named Joey Cusack who had dealings with him in the [[K&A Gang|Irish Mob in Philadelphia]]. Tom vehemently denies this, but Fogarty remains persistent and begins to stalk the Stall family. Under pressure from Fogarty and his newfound fame, Tom's relationships with his family become strained.  Following an argument with his father over the use of violence on a bully at his school, Jack runs away. He is caught by Fogarty, who, with Jack as his hostage, goes with his men to the Stall house and demands that "Joey" return to Philadelphia with them. After the gangsters release Jack, Tom is slow to join them in their car, so they attempt to force him to cooperate. Tom kills the two henchmen with the same precision he used against the robbers, but Fogarty shoots Tom before he can do the same to him. As Fogarty stands over Tom, preparing to kill him, Tom finally drops the faÃ§ade and admits he is indeed Joey. However, before Fogarty can deliver a [[coup de grÃ¢ce]], Jack kills Fogarty with a shotgun.  At the hospital, Edie confronts Tom, claiming that while he was attacking Fogarty's men, she saw "the real Joey" that Fogarty was talking about. Tom shocks Edie by admitting that he is actually Joey Cusack, and that he has killed for both money and pleasure. He tells Edie that he ran away from Philadelphia to escape his violent criminal past. This admission deepens the tensions in their marriage.  After Tom gets out of the hospital, Sam, the local sheriff, pays a visit. Sam expresses confusion about everything that has happened. He tells Tom and Edie that these mobsters wouldn't go to all this trouble if they weren't sure they had the right man. Just when Tom is about to confess, Edie lies to Sam, claiming that Tom is who he says he is, that their family has suffered enough. At a loss for words after Edie breaks down into tears, Sam leaves. Edie and Tom then start slapping and hitting each other, their fight eventually culminating in violent [[hate sex]] on the stairs; this is in contrast to the tender and romantic sex they were shown having in the beginning of the film. Afterward, Edie and Jack continue to further distance themselves from Tom, leaving him isolated. He receives a call from his brother Richie Cusack, who also demands his return to Philadelphia, or else he will come to Indiana to find him. After traveling to meet his brother, Tom learns that the other mobsters whom he had offended in Philadelphia took out their frustrations on Richie, penalizing him financially and delaying his advancement in the organization. Tom offers to make peace, but Richie orders his men to kill his brother. Tom manages to kill most of the guards and escape. As Richie and his last henchman are hunting for him, Tom surprises and kills both of them.  Tom returns home, where the atmosphere is tense and silent as the family sits around the dinner table. The future of his marriage and his life as Tom Stall are uncertain, but Jack and Sarah indicate their acceptance of their father by setting a plate for him and passing him some food. The film ends as Edie looks up at Tom, leaving their future in question.

Hostage (2005 film)
 Former [[LAPD SWAT|L.A. SWAT]] officer Jeff Talley is a [[hostage negotiator]] in [[Los Angeles]]. One day, Talley negotiates with a man who has taken his wife and son hostage after learning his wife was cheating on him. Shortly after Talley denies a SWAT commander's request to give snipers the order to open fire, the despondent man kills his wife, son, and himself. Traumatized, Talley moves with his family and becomes police chief in Bristo Camino, a fictional suburban hamlet in nearby [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]].  A year later, Talley finds himself in another hostage situation. Two troubled teenaged brothers, Dennis and Kevin Kelly, and a sociopathic accomplice, Marshall "Mars" Krupcheck, all very well-armed, take Walter Smith and his two children, Jennifer and Tommy, hostage in the Smith home after a failed robbery attempt. Dennis had told his younger brother to wait in the car, not anticipating the siege to come, but Kevin refused.  A female police officer, Carol Flores, responds after Tommy turns on the silent alarm. She is shot twice by Mars just before Talley arrives. She dies in front of him. Traumatized and unwilling to put himself through another tragedy, Talley hands authority over to the [[Ventura County Sheriff's Department|county sheriff]] and leaves.  Smith had been [[Money laundering|laundering money]] for a mysterious [[right-wing]] [[militia]] and criminal syndicate through offshore shell corporations. He was preparing to turn over a batch of important [[Encryption|encrypted]] files recorded on a [[DVD]] when he was taken hostage. To prevent the incriminating evidence from being discovered, the syndicate orders a ruthless operative, known as "the Watchman", to kidnap Talley's wife and daughter. Talley is instructed by "the Watchman", to return to the hostage scene, regain authority, and stall for time until the organization can launch its own attack against Smith's house. Otherwise, Talley's wife and daughter will be murdered.  Dennis forces Kevin and Mars to tie up the children, while he knocks out Smith and finds a small fortune in cash, money which the syndicate had paid Smith. In an attempt to end the standoff and secure the DVDs himself, Talley meets with Dennis and agrees to provide a helicopter in exchange for half of the money.   When the helicopter arrives, Dennis and Kevin bring the money to Talley and prepare to leave, but Mars refuses to leave without Jennifer, with whom he has become infatuated. Talley says the helicopter will only carry three passengers and insists Jennifer stay behind, but the deal breaks down and the boys and Jennifer return to the house. Talley learns that Mars is a sociopath who could turn on the hostages and his own accomplices at any moment. Mars does, in fact, kill Kevin, just as Kevin is about to release the children. Mars then kills Dennis.  The syndicate sends fake [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents to recover the DVD and they storm the house; Talley is instructed to not go near the house. Jennifer manages to stab Mars, but not fatally, and locks herself and Tommy in the [[panic room]].   Hearing their screams, Talley breaches the house and is attacked by Mars, who then kills most of the fake agents using his pistol and multiple homemade [[Molotov cocktail]]s. Mars is then shot in the side by the only surviving agent. The agent tracks down Talley and the children, and demands the encrypted DVD. When Talley asks that the children be allowed to leave, the fake agent shoots Talley, but it is not a fatal wound. After Talley gives him the DVD, Mars reappears, carrying two homemade Molotov cocktails, distracting the agent long enough to be killed by Talley. Mars then prepares to throw his last Molotov, but collapses to his knees, weakened by his injuries. He makes eye contact with Jennifer, then drops the Molotov and [[Self-immolation|immolates himself]].  Talley escapes with the children by shooting the indoor glass waterfall, which extinguishes the fire caused by Mars' first Molotov. He and a recovered Smith then go to a rundown inn where Talley's wife and daughter are being held captive by the Watchman and his crew.   Smith, feigning hatred for Talley, is freed in exchange for the family. While demanding that the Watchman kill Talley, Smith shoots the Watchman in the head. This allows Talley to kill the other gunmen in similar fashion and rescue his own family.

The police quickly arrive, and Red, Wolf, Granny, and the Woodsman are questioned by Detective Nicky Flippers ([[David Ogden Stiers]]) about the events leading up to the incident.  Red explains that she was delivering goodies for her grandmother when she discovered a threat from the mysterious Goodie Bandit. Hoping to save her Granny's recipes, she embarked upon a journey to take them to the top of a nearby mountain where her Granny lives. On her way, she encountered the Wolf, who asked her a series of suspicious questions. She managed to escape and eventually reached her Granny's house; however, she found the Wolf already waiting in ambush.  What at first seems to be an open-and-shut case becomes confused though, once it is learned that the Wolf is an investigative reporter. He reveals that he was searching for a lead on the identity of the Goody Bandit and had reason to believe that Red and Granny were the culprits. Locating Red, he questioned her, hoping to get to the bottom of the mystery. When Red escaped, he headed for her Granny's house and arriving first, went undercover, hoping to trick her into giving him the evidence he needed.  When questioned, the Woodsman, Kirk, reveals that he is in fact an aspiring actor who was only trying out for the part of a woodsman in a commercial. After his [[schnitzel]] truck was robbed by the Goody Bandit, he went out into the woods to get in character for his role and spent the rest of the day chopping trees. A large tree rolled after him and pushed him through the window of Granny's home. The investigation then turns to Granny, who reveals that, unbeknownst to her family, she is an extreme sports enthusiast. During a ski race earlier that day, she was attacked by the opposing team, but got away safely after learning that they were hired by the Goody Bandit.  Despondent over her Granny's lack of honesty, Red wanders off alone. Meanwhile, Nicky Flippers realizes that the one commonality between all four stories is a bunny named Boingo  ([[Andy Dick]]) and concludes that he is the Goody Bandit. However, Boingo has already sneaked into the home and stolen Granny's recipes. Red sees Boingo and follows him to his hideout at a cable car station, but the police pursue him in the wrong direction. Granny, the Wolf, and Kirk manage to locate Boingo as he is explaining his evil scheme to Red. Boingo plans to add an addictive substance to the stolen recipes and then destroy the forest, making way for new real estate for expanding his business.  The Wolf and Kirk go undercover to distract Boingo as Granny sneaks into his lair, but open conflict ensues. Boingo sends a bound and gagged Red down the mountain in a cable car loaded with explosives and Granny goes after her, with Boingo and his henchmen in pursuit. Red manages to free herself, and escapes with Granny, while the police, who have been located by the Wolf's squirrel assistant Twitchy ([[Cory Edwards]]), are waiting at the bottom of the mountain to arrest Boingo and his henchmen. Some time later, Kirk finds success as part of a yodeling troupe, and Red, Granny, the Wolf, and Twitchy are enlisted by Nicky Flippers to join a crime solving organization called Happily Ever After Agency.

Sunny Chopra ([[Vivek Oberoi]]) is a 28-year-old writer who has carved a name for himself as a popular agony uncle, named Gyan Guru, writing for the ''Times of Hindustan''.

A bit of a cynic, he believes he is a self-made man and that whatever he has achieved in life is due to his own hard work and nobody else's. His cynicism is extended to his views about marriage to his fiancÃ©e Jenny ([[Ayesha Takia]]) and to the festival of Diwali too.  Just as Sunny is cynical about life, Michael Burnett ([[Boman Irani]]) is optimistic about it. 51-year-old Michael is a simple-minded man, almost childlike and has recently landed job as a [[pizza delivery]] boy at Mummy's Pizza.

On the eve of Diwali, Sunny has loads of stuff to do and very little time to do it. He has to meet his screenplay deadline, he has to get rid of Pandey ([[Saurabh Shukla]]), his irritatingly intrusive next door neighbor, and he's got to avoid his editor's telephone calls who is livid that he's bunking work. But more importantly he needs to get Jenny out of the way because he has a date with Maya ([[Mahima Chaudhary]]), a South Indian superstar who he has been in love with since as long as he can remember. In this confusion, Sunny forgets that there is no food in his bachelor pad and orders a pizza that Michael is given the task of delivering. And what Michael delivers to Sunny is so much more than just a pizza. Sunny is home delivered life's simple lessons â right to his doorstep.  
House of Wax (2005 film)
  In 2005, Carly Jones, her twin brother Nick, her boyfriend Wade, her best friend Paige, Paige's boyfriend Blake and Nick's friend Dalton are on their way to a football game in [[Louisiana]]. When night falls, the group sets up camp, after which a foul smell hangs in the air. A stranger in a pickup truck visits their campsite, shines his lights and refuses to leave or address them until Nick smashes one of his headlights. The next morning, Wade discovers that his car's fan belt is broken. Carly and Paige wander into the woods, where Carly tumbles down a hill and falls into a pit filled with rotting animal carcasses. After rescuing her, the group meets a strange, rural man named Lester, who offers to drive Carly and Wade to the nearby town of Ambrose to get a new fan belt, while the rest of them go to the football game.  The two arrive at Ambrose, which is virtually a ghost town. Unable to find an attendant at the gas station, they wander into the church, disrupting a funeral. There, they meet a mechanic named Bo, who offers to sell them a fan belt after the funeral. While waiting for the services to end, Carly and Wade visit the 'House of Wax', a [[wax museum]] which itself is made of wax and is the central feature of the town. The gas station does not have the right size fan belt, so they follow Bo to his house. Inside, Wade is knocked out by Bo's twin brother, Vincent, who is wearing a wax mask to cover his disfigured face, since they were conjoined, with Vincent's face attached to the back of Bo's head and separated as children. Outside, Carly realizes Bo is the one who visited them the night before, after noticing his car's broken headlight. She runs to the church for help, but finds out that it is populated only by wax sculptures. Bo captures Carly and brings her to the cellar of the gas station, where she is restrained and her lips are glued. Meanwhile, Vincent strips Wade naked and straps him to a chair, where he is both injected with and covered in molten wax.  Nick, Dalton, Paige and Blake realize they will not arrive at the game in time and return. Nick and Dalton arrive in Ambrose to find Carly and Wade. Nick visits the gas station, where he questions Bo about Carly's whereabouts. When she tries to gain Nick's attention, Bo cuts off the tip of Carly's finger, but she uses the blood from her finger to open her glued lips apart and screams for help. Nick fends off Bo and frees Carly. Meanwhile, Dalton finds Wade, who is still alive but unable to move because of the wax. Attempting to peel off the wax, Dalton realizes that he is unintentionally removing Wade's skin in the process. Vincent finds Dalton and slashes Wade's face with a machete, killing him. After a chase through the museum, Vincent catches Dalton and beheads him. Meanwhile, Nick and Carly realize that all of the town's inhabitants are real people covered in wax; Bo and Vincent have been luring people in and covering them in wax to make the figures look more realistic.  At the campsite, just as Blake and Paige are about to have sex, Vincent arrives and kills Blake, after which he chases Paige to an abandoned sugar mill where he kills her by throwing and impaling a pipe through her forehead. Nick and Carly return to the house to find Wade and Dalton. When Bo and Vincent return, they chase Carly and Nick to the House of Wax. It is revealed that Bo is the "evil" twin and Vincent is the "good" twin; following their parents' death, Bo has been controlling the more mild-mannered Vincent through physical and verbal abuse. After a chase, Carly beats Bo to death with a baseball bat. Nick unintentionally sets the House of Wax on fire and the wax figures start to melt, as does the entire museum. Enraged by his brother's death, Vincent chases Carly to the top floor, but Nick attacks him, allowing Carly to stab him. His body falls through the floor and he lands on top of his brother Bo's corpse. Carly and Nick escape the House of Wax as it melts to the ground.  The next day, the police arrive and report that Ambrose has been abandoned for ten years when the local sugar mill failed.

A man in a nearby apartment, Alexei, invites them to stay at his place that night. He convinces them to visit a hostel in [[Slovakia]] filled with beautiful women. The three board a train to Slovakia, where they encounter a strange Dutch businessman who touches Josh on the leg. Josh yells at him, causing the embarrassed businessman to leave. When they arrive in Slovakia, they are impressed by the beauty of the town and the grandeur of the hostel and find their roommates are two beautiful women, Natalya and Svetlana, who invite them to the spa, and later to the disco. That night, at the disco, Josh goes outside but is attacked by a gang of local kids known as the "Bubblegum gang" and is rescued by the Dutch businessman, buying him a beer to thank him and apologise for his reaction on the train. Paxton and Josh have sex with Natalya and Svetlana, while Ãli leaves with the desk girl, Vala. The next morning, they are surprised to see that Ãli hasn't returned, and they are unable to contact him. They are later approached by a Japanese girl named Kana, who shows them a photo of Ãli and her friend Yuki, who has disappeared as well.  They get a selfie from Ãli who told them he went home but they find it strange and unusual for him. Although Josh is anxious to leave, Paxton convinces him to stay one more night to have sex with the girls again. That night, Josh and Paxton are slipped tranquilizers.  Josh stumbles back to the hotel room, while Paxton passes out in the disco's storage room. Josh wakes up in a dungeon-like room, and is approached by a man who drills holes into his chest and legs. The man removes his mask, revealing himself as the Dutch Businessman, and tells Josh about his failed dream of becoming a surgeon. After Josh begs to be set free, the Dutch Businessman slices Josh's achilles tendons, and removes his restraints. Unable to walk, Josh attempts to crawl to the door, but the Dutch Businessman slices his throat with a scalpel, killing him.   Meanwhile, Paxton wakes up the next morning and returns to the hostel. He gets frustrated with the desk clerk, who insists that he already checked out, and when he returns to his room, he is greeted by two women, who invite him to the spa in an eerily similar manner to Natalya and Svetlana. Paxton finds Natalya and Svetlana at a pub and asks them if they know where Josh is. Natalya tells him that Josh and Ãli are visiting an art exhibit, and she agrees to take him there. They arrive at an old factory, and Paxton is horrified to find Josh's mutilated corpse being stitched together by the Dutch Businessman. Paxton is then ambushed by thugs and dragged down a hallway, passing by several rooms where other people are being gruesomely tortured. He is brought to a cell, where he is restrained in a chair and joined minutes later by a German client named Johann. Paxton begs in German to be let go.  After severing two of Paxton's fingers with a chainsaw, Johann unintentionally removes his restraints as well. Johann charges at Paxton with the chainsaw but slips and severs his own leg. Paxton reaches for a gun and shoots Johann in the head. A guard enters the room but Paxton shoots him and escapes the cell. Paxton enters another room and hides in the bottom of a cart filled with corpses, and severed limbs. A butcher takes the corpses to the bottom floor to be incinerated, and Paxton bludgeons him with a sledge hammer. He then takes the elevator to the top floor and enters the dressing room, where he changes into business clothes, and finds a business card for the Elite Hunting club, an organization where rich people pay to kill tourists. He also meets an American client, who mistakes him for another customer, and picks up his gun.  Paxton escapes the factory but returns after hearing cries for help. He enters another room and discovers Kana having her face and eye tortured by the American client. After killing the American client, Paxton and Kana flee in a stolen car, pursued by guards. While driving, Paxton sees Natalya, Svetlana, and Alexei, and runs them over, killing them. Paxton and Kana make it to the train station, but after seeing a reflection of her disfigured face, Kana leaps in front of an oncoming train and kills herself. This creates a distraction, allowing Paxton to board another train unnoticed.  Once aboard, Paxton hears the voice of the Dutch Businessman. When the train stops in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], Paxton follows him to a public restroom and throws the Elite Hunting card under his stall. When the Dutch Businessman reaches down to pick it up, Paxton grabs his hand and cuts off the same fingers he lost during his escape. He then breaks into the stall and nearly drowns the Dutch Businessman in the toilet, but allows him to see his reflection before slitting his throat and killing him. Paxton then leaves to board another train.  ===Alternate ending=== In the Director's Cut, Paxton kidnaps the Dutch Businessman's daughter instead of killing him. After finding her teddy bear in the restroom she was supposed to be in, the Dutch Businessman searches for his missing daughter unaware that Paxton's train has just left.  
House of the Dead II
 A few months after the events of the first film, Professor Roy Curien at the fictional Cuesta Verde University (CVU), has managed to subdue and contain a "Hyper sapiens" specimen, who is revealed to be his son, Rudy Curien, (a survivor of the Isla del Morte incident from the first film). Curien experiments on another survivor (Alicia), trying to determine the source of her immortality, with apparent disregard for the rotted state of Alicia's body. When Curien has created a serum that he believes will bring back the dead and grant immortality, Curien murders one of his students and injects her with the serum. She returns to life, infects Curien and breaks out of the building.  A month later, the university has a full-fledged outbreak, which is confirmed by AMC reconnaissance teams. Jake Ellis, an agent for AMS, goes in search of fellow agent Alexandra "Nightingale" Morgan. He finds her on a date at a restaurant, where she must execute several infected people before she returns to base with Ellis. After being ordered to retrieve a blood sample from the originally infected specimen on campus, they are warned that missiles will level the campus at midnight, regardless of whether the agents are still present or not. She assigns a gender-mixed [[Special forces|Special Forces]] team of [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] to provide them with backup. Ellis openly questions the competence of the soldiers, leading to friction between the two units. Upon arrival at CVU, the soldiers encounter zombies. One soldier panics and another becomes infected after his gun jams. When the others discover his injury, they sever his infected arm, but he turns and infects the team medic; both are executed by Ellis. The team continues forward into the university proper.  They proceed to battle through the hordes of infected, splitting into two teams. Two female soldiers, Lieutenant Alison Henson and Private Maria Rodriguez, and a male soldier, Bart, investigate the dorms. They break into a female dormitory where they find the deceased naked body of a zombie. Bart attempts to pose with the corpse and is bitten by a mosquito trapped in the room. Fearing contamination but unwilling to execute Bart, who is threatening them with a handgun, Henson handcuffs Bart to a radiator and the two soldiers exit the room, falling back to the van. Meanwhile, the second team, including Ellis and Nightingale, are attacked multiple times. Eventually, every soldier escorting them is killed, including the leader of the unit, Sergeant Griffin. They fight their way to the professor's laboratory and find the original specimen still imprisoned, as well as a pair of students, Lonny and Sarah, who had survived. They enter the confinement room and extract blood from the zombie, but are forced to kill it when it breaks free. Lonny and Sarah, who had allowed them into the confinement room are overrun and torn apart by zombies, and Ellis and Nightingale escape while the zombies are feeding on the bodies.  Henson and Rodriguez make it to the extraction vehicle. There, they prepare to rescue Nightingale and Ellis, but Rodriguez is bitten by a zombie who was locked in the back of the van by the soldier assigned to guard it. Henson executes Rodriguez, and the duo arrive in front of the science building as Nightingale and Ellis fight their way through a horde of zombies. Ellis and Nightingale are saved by Henson, but the blood sample vial is destroyed in the process. They are forced to turn back, with ten minutes before the military releases the missile level the campus, and fight their way back to the confinement room. They retrieve a second vial, but Henson is bitten on the ankle. She remains behind and commits suicide, as Nightingale and Ellis escape before the missile strikes the campus and only Ellis made it out but Nightingale trapped surrounded by zombies. Bart breaks free from the dormitory by amputating his hand and forces Ellis to hand over the vial. Bart decides to kill Ellis anyway, Nightingale survives and kills Bart. His dying action is to pull the pin on a hand grenade, destroying the vial in the process. Nightingale is wounded but uncertain of whether she's infected. Ellis refuses to execute her, as the two leave together and headed to the city, finding that the infection has spread to the rest of the city.  
The House of Sand
  In 1910, pregnant Ãurea (Torres) along with her mother, Maria (Montenegro) arrive at a remote, [[desert]]-like part of the [[Brazil]]ian state of [[MaranhÃ£o]]âcalled the [[LenÃ§Ã³is Maranhenses]]âwhere her fanatical husband Vasco de SÃ¡ (Ruy Guerra) has relocated the family from the state's capital, [[SÃ£o LuÃ­s, MaranhÃ£o|SÃ£o LuÃ­s]], to start a farm. Soon the white settlers realize that they are not alone: a group of descendants of runaway slaves live in the area, in a settlementâgenerally known as a ''[[quilombo]]''âthey call "The Island" because it is the only permanently fertile spot in a sea of sand where it rains only during the rainy season. Due to the madness of Vasco, Maria seeks to bribe the black settlers to take her and her daughter away, but they, while taking her money (it is basically useless in the local [[barter economy]]), do no such thing.  However, soon enough Vasco's workers abandon the farm. Vasco, enraged over this betrayal, dies when he accidentally buries himself under a heap of construction material for the half-finished house. This leaves the two women with no way of returning to the city. Left to their own devices, they venture out to explore the area. They find a fishing hut on the shores of the ocean and notice that Massu (Seu Jorge), the fisherman, has salt which he regularly obtains from his father on the nearby Island. Massu takes them there, as they seek to follow the [[edible salt|salt]] trail out of the desert. However, Massu's father does not know where the salt comes from since he is the grandson of a runaway slave; he already had been born in the sanctuary; he does not know the world beyond the Island. Yet soon they establish contact with the itinerant trader who brings the salt (fittingly called Chico do Sal), but he too does not offer any viable connection back to the civilization.  Unable to return for now, Ãurea and Maria get settled and with the help of Massu start a small farming operation. Nine years after their arrival, Ãurea still longs to return to her former life while her mother seems quite content since she feels she does not have anything worthwhile to return to. Aurea has been purchasing beasts of burden to venture out of the sandy trap. When the old trader dies, Ãurea, following a fresh trail in the sand by herself, sets out to return her family to civilization. She finds an international scientific expedition that, for the purpose of observing the [[solar eclipse of May 29, 1919]], had come to the remote desert to verify claims made by [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[General Relativity]] concerning the curvature of space.<ref>This expedition, headed by British astronomer Sir [[Arthur Eddington]], is a historical fact. One party observed the eclipse on the island [[PrÃ­ncipe]], to the west of equatorial Africa's coast; another did the same in Brazil. However, the Brazilian location was not MaranhÃ£o but rather [[Sobral, CearÃ¡]].</ref> Ãurea falls in love with Luiz, a young soldier escorting the expedition, whom she also asks to request permission for her and her family to return home with the scientists. Ãurea hurries back home to bring her mother and daughter to the expedition. However, when she returns to her "house of sand", the dunes have further encroached upon her house; the mother has died, the daughter (also named Maria) has found refuge with Massuâbut precious time is lost: they miss the expedition.  Luiz had not only told her that he wanted to join the newly established [[Brazilian Air Force]]; he had also told her that the scientists would come back in a few months to continue their studies. She and her daughter check back regularly where the expedition had established a [[geodesic]] marker since Ãurea does not want to stay in the desert mainly because, as she confides to her daughter, she misses "real music", that is, the classical music she played on the piano when she was younger. The expedition returns but Ãurea misses it. Massu, who saw it with his son, did not tell her about it. When Aurea realizes that she had missed her lifeline back to her world, she resigns herself to her fate and links up with Massu. As young Maria grows older, Ãurea is troubled by the fact that she, out of boredom, has become a drunk and cheap prostitute for the young men of the Island, aborting her pregnancies.  Their fate is fundamentally altered when, in 1942 (the year Brazil declared war on the [[Axis powers]]), a Brazilian military plane crashes in the ocean nearby. A search party is sent out that is commanded by Luiz, now a high-ranking officer with the Brazilian Air Force. Luiz, who is married, first sees Maria and is reminded by her of her mother Ãurea (in fact, Maria now is played by Fernanda Torres, who first played young Ãurea; Ãurea now is played by Fernanda Montenegro who first played Ãurea's mother, Maria). Eventually, he meets Ãurea in person who begs him to take Maria with him. This he does, promising to look after her, while Ãurea contently stays with Massu in the desert.  About three decades later, Maria finally returns to the house she grew up in. She finds her gray-haired mother, sitting by herself at their old kitchen table. They happily reunite, and Maria brings deep joy to Ãurea when she plays a tape-recording of "real music", [[FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chopin]]'s [[Prelude (music)|PrÃ©lude]] "Raindrops", op. 28, no. 15. Contemplating the moon together, Maria tells her mother that man had landed on the [[moon]] (in 1969). Ãurea, remembring a conversation she had with Luiz fifty years earlier concerning Einstein's theory of [[Special Relativity]], asks her daughter whether the astronauts, travelling at high speed in a rocket, returned younger than they left. Maria, unlike her seemingly isolated mother not acquainted with the [[twin paradox]] (that Luiz attempted to explain to Ãurea in 1919, and the latter did not entirely understand), states that they returned older. When asked what they found on the moon, Maria replies: Nothing but sand.

During this time, Uncle Chiu discovers Siu-bo's shop trashed and calls up Nicky to tell him of his father's disappearance. Finding a secret room at the back of his shop, Nicky finds out of his great past as a [[VIP Protection Unit|G4]] agent assigned to protect former spies. Seeking more information, Siu-bo is injected with a truth serum by Rocco's men, and in his degraded mental state he reveals that he hid memory cards of his past activity in the lucky charms of his children. Rocco sends agents to Natalie, who is acting in a play, but Nicky manages to get to her and escape with some help from Ella and Jason.  As they hide out in Jason's house, Natalie finds out about the memory card in her charm and has Jason try to open it. They then find out that the card needs the other memory card to function, but Nicky in his haste to get to the shop left it in his locker at the park. Nicky and Natalie then attempt to get it during the dead of night, but are intercepted by two of Rocco's minions. After defeating the minions, a phone rings, and they get into direct contact with Rocco, who threatens their father's death if they do not help him in his quest for revenge. He gives them one day to find the agent, and then cuts the conversation.  Nicky and Natalie get back to Jason's house and find out that they require voice authentication from their father to access the file. Jason works through the night to create a file that would match Siu-bo's voice. During this time Siu-bo attempts to escape, but is foiled by Rocco's son, who is extremely adept with a bo staff. Jason finishes the file, and is finally able to access the database. They find out that Rocco's target is actually Uncle Chiu, who turns out to be the same agent that left Rocco paralyzed and captured him. Nicky and Natalie try to leave to recover their father and find Uncle Chiu, but Jason traps them in his studio, and reveals that he is Siu-bo's co-agent and does not want them to get hurt. He also reveals that his romantic intentions with Natalie are real, and not just a cover story.  Jason makes his way to Uncle Chiu to warn him to escape, and the old Uncle initially accepts, asking for a final moment to spend with his granddaughter. An ambulance creates a distraction from Jason to reveal Uncle Chiu attempting to escape by climbing and running across rooftops. The siblings, initially thinking they were left trapped in Jason's home, find an air vent to escape in, and follow Jason to Uncle Chiu's restaurant. Jason chases Uncle Chiu, but injures his ankle on attempting to jump between buildings and is saved by a fire hose thrown out by Uncle Chiu. Nicky and Natalie catch up to him, and ask him for help in saving their father. He relents, and Jason calls Nicky to throw him his car's keys, so they could get Uncle Chiu to Rocco in time.  Nicky and Natalie take a boat to Rocco's lair, and demand to see their father. Rocco reveals him to be trapped in a tank rapidly emptying of air, and rebuffs them without the agent he is looking for. Uncle Chiu shows up, and Rocco calls in his men to kill them. They fight their way through everyone, with Natalie breaking out Siu-bo by applying a kung fu technique he taught her in her youth, Nicky saving Uncle Chiu from a killing blow and defeating Rocco's son. Nicky leaves Rocco unharmed after he makes him fall off his wheelchair, and everyone manages to leave Rocco's lair alive. In the ending scene, Jason comes to Siu-bo's home to apologize to Natalie, which she accepts. Nicky finally gets the courage to have a French kiss with Ella, and Siu-bo and Uncle Chiu play a game of chess, with Chiu's granddaughter watching.

As they await arrival of the bride, Henrietta confides to Luce that she is nicknamed "H" because, supposedly, her mother exclaimed "Jesus H. Christ!" upon discovering she was pregnant. Rachel arrives with her father and the ceremony begins. As Rachel is walking down the aisle, her eyes wander and she makes eye contact with Luce. It is apparent that a connection between them has been made as their eyes meet. Rachel looks away, then quickly back, but Luce is gone. The ceremony continues according to plan, and Rachel and Hector marry. At the reception afterwards, Luce introduces herself to Rachel as the one who did the flowers as she is about to get punch. Rachel nervously blocks Luce's attempt to get a drink, and when she questions why she can't have any, Rachel reveals that her wedding ring accidentally fell in. The two share a moment together, but it is over after Luce fishes the ring out of the punch bowl and goes on her way.  Some time later, Rachel goes to Luce's shop and invites her to dinner with Hector and, unknown to Luce, Cooper, a perennial bachelor and self-professed [[Lothario]]. Rachel has planned to set up Luce with Coop, while Luce confides to Heck moments before Coop arrives that she's a lesbian. Heck takes this news in stride and is bemused as Coop is undeterred in his attempts to seduce Luce. During the meal, when Coop starts bragging, Luce espouses she believes in love at first sight, while Rachel says it takes time to find the right person. Later on that night, Rachel and Luce share a moment together on the balcony as it rains.  The next day while grocery shopping, Heck and Rachel run into Luce and a woman friend, Edie. Heck then tells Rachel that Luce is gay.  Heck inquires as to the relationship of Luce and Edie, but they assure Rachel and him that nothing is going on. Edie says Luce "loves another".  It becomes apparent that Rachel is trying to avoid Luce when she spots her one night. When Heck has to work long hours at his unsatisfying job, he sets Luce and Rachel up to spend time together as friends, despite Rachel's reluctance at the time. The two spend an evening together, visiting a [[Association football|football]] match and an arcade, which becomes the setting for a [[Dance Dance Revolution]] sequence. At the end of the night, Luce walks Rachel back to her flat. Their goodbye grows awkward from tension, then Rachel leans forward to kiss Luce, but withdraws at the last moment and goes inside her home.  Over the next few days, Rachel continues to resist her growing attraction to Luce in an effort to remain loyal to Heck. For her part, Luce has no wish to break up a committed couple. Unable to deny what she is feeling, Rachel eventually confronts Luce directly at her flower shop. She tells Luce that a romance between them cannot happen, turns to leave, and returns seconds later to kiss Luce in the back of Luce's shop. Their foreplay gets interrupted by Heck, who has stopped by to pick up flowers for Rachel. He tells Luce that he has sensed the distance growing between him and Rachel and partially blames himself for not being there for her. Hearing this, Rachel runs off, later sorrowfully agreeing with Luce that they can't betray Heck. In the meantime, Heck reaches his breaking point at his job and finally quits. When he returns home drunk, Rachel rashly confesses all to him as he sleeps, but without saying who her love is. Heck, who was actually feigning sleep, later calls Coop for support. Coop angrily confronts Luce after figuring out it was her with whom Rachel fell in love. Luce decides that being near Rachel without being with her is too hard. She makes plans to go on an extended trip out of the country, leaving care of her shop to her mother.  While Rachel and Heck are celebrating her birthday at her parents', H tells them about Luce's trip. Heck notices Rachel's reaction to the news and figures out that it was Luce with whom Rachel fell in love. Heck does not want to be her second choice or to live a lie, but does want her to be happy, so he leaves. Rachel then confesses to her parents that she is in love with a woman and, with their help, she tracks down Luce, who has already taken a taxi to the airport. Rachel gets stuck in traffic and tries to call Luce, who ignores her. However, Rachel realizes Luce is in the same traffic jam when she hears the same man on a bicycle singing "[[Happy Together (song)|Happy Together]]" and comments, "I've heard that song before", and proceeds to climb on the roof of her car. She then uses the lessons Luce taught her at the football match about how to yell loudly to call to her. The two women reunite and kiss each other in the middle of a crowded London street.  As the [[ending credits]] roll, we see the characters some time later. Heck is on a plane to an unknown destination, all set to write his travel book, when he discovers a young woman ([[Angel Coulby]]) will be sitting next to him for the long flight. There is an obvious and immediate attraction, and nervous flirtation, between them. The scenes continue with H and her young boyfriend playing at a playground, Coop holding a baby, and Luce and Rachel enjoying each other's company.

In Her Shoes (film)
  Maggie ([[Cameron Diaz]]) and Rose Feller ([[Toni Collette]]) are sisters with nothing in common but their shoe size. They were raised by their father Michael ([[Ken Howard]]) and stepmother ([[Candice Azzara]]) after their mother Caroline died in a car accident. Rose is the eldest; an ostensibly plain and serious lawyer who is protective of Maggie despite her flaws. Maggie is a free spirit who is unable to hold a steady job (due to her virtual inability to read) and turns to alcohol and men for emotional and financial support. Rose grudgingly allows Maggie to move in with her in her [[Rittenhouse Square]] apartment in [[Philadelphia]] when their stepmother throws her out of the house.  Their already difficult relationship ends when Rose catches Maggie in bed with Jim ([[Richard Burgi]]), her boyfriend. This leads to an argument in which Rose berates Maggie about her inability to read, and taunts her saying that she couldn't even spell Jim's name, when Maggie calls her sister a 'fat pig'. This apparently becomes the last straw for Rose, and she tries to choke Maggie. Both of them cry, and Maggie subsequently disappears from Rose's life.  A few days before, while secretly looking through her father's desk for money, Maggie discovered a bundle of old greeting cards containing cash.  She was astonished to discover that the cards were addressed to both her and Rose and were from their grandmother Ella ([[Shirley MacLaine]]).  Now, homeless and without job prospects, Maggie travels to [[Deerfield Beach, Florida|Florida]] to find her and hopefully a new source of income.  When Ella first hears from Maggie, she invites her to stay in her home. She admits to her close friend Ethel how Caroline was [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]], and sent Ella a note several days before her death to look after her girls. So she lets Maggie stay with her partially out of guilt for abandoning her responsibilities as a grandmother.  However, as time passes, Ella discovers that Maggie has come to do nothing but sunbathe and take money from her.  Maggie asks Ella to finance an acting career for her; Ella agrees to match her salary dollar for dollar if she accepts a job with the [[assisted living]] section of her grandmother's retirement community.  Meanwhile, Rose has decided to quit her job, become a dog-walker, and date Simon Stein ([[Mark Feuerstein]]) whom she had previously ignored.  They become engaged.  Maggie is befriended by one of her patients, a blind retired professor of [[English literature]] ([[Norman Lloyd]]), who has asked Maggie to read works of poetry to him.<ref>The first poem Maggie is asked to read is [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=176996 ''One art''] by [[Elizabeth Bishop]]</ref>  She does so, but with great difficulty. After asking if she is dyslexic, the professor encourages Maggie to continue reading to him while offering emotional support to her.  Maggie finds a friend in the professor, the first person in her life who does not ridicule her difficulties with reading (and actually helps her to improve in this area).  As time passes with the professor, Maggie's confidence grows not only with reading but with her general image of herself.  In addition, she also becomes friendly with the residents of the retirement community.  In doing so, Maggie discovers a livelihood that is greatly needed among the elderly women: a [[personal shopper|personal clothing shopper]], an activity for which Maggie shows enormous talent.  Ella (who also does not ridicule her difficulties with math) offers to run the financial aspects of the business.  In the process, they become close and resolve their history.  Meanwhile, Rose's reluctance to talk about Maggie is straining her relationships with those around her, such as Simon, her father, and stepmother.  While Michael remains oblivious to his daughters' falling out and the stepmother does not care much of the sisters, Simon tries to get Rose to talk about Maggie.  When he sees Rose and former boyfriend Jim converse about how Rose cannot talk about Maggie to anyone, Simon's patience has grown thin and effectively dumps Rose after she keeps protecting Maggie by staying silent.  Ella has also secretly contacted Rose and sends a plane ticket asking her to come for a visit.  Rose is excited to hear from her long-lost grandmother, but her pleasure quickly sours when she arrives and discovers that her sister already lives there.  After a long conversation with Ella, Rose reveals that after Caroline took Rose and Maggie on a spontaneous trip to New York (without Michael's knowledge), Michael and Caroline got into a huge argument, with Michael threatening to put her in a mental institution.  Caroline killed herself 2 days later and sent a note to Ella, pleading with her to take care of her daughters.  Maggie does not remember this as Rose shielded her from the events to protect her.  Ella never recovered from Caroline's death and never resolved her feelings towards Michael; for she felt he ignored the signs that his wife had problems.  The three women bond and learn to resolve their complicated past.  Meanwhile, Maggie has contacted Simon telling that Rose is in Florida and "in trouble" and arranges him to meet Rose at the elderly residents' party.  The two rekindle their engagement after Rose finally opens up about Maggie's personality and Rose's desire to protect her fearing that Simon will come to hate Maggie.  Before Rose and Simon return to Philadelphia Maggie offers to pick out and buy Rose's wedding dress, as a now seasoned personal shopper she is confident that she can please Rose saying simply "trust me".  At Rose's wedding which takes place at the Jamaican Jerk Hut where their first date was. Ella and Michael reconcile and Maggie reads a poem<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=179622 ''i carry your heart with me''] by [[E. E. Cummings]]</ref> to Rose as a wedding gift which moves Rose to tears.

Initial D (film)
 Taking place in [[Gunma]] prefecture in [[Japan]], the story concerns a young [[tofu]]-delivery driver named Takumi Fujiwara. He trained from a young age and before he could drive to deliver tofu to the peak of Mt. Akina ([[Mt. Haruna]] in real-life). He had been trained to an incredible level of skill in taking on the five hairpin corners plus using the gutter techniques of Mt. Akina. The film chronicles his evolution from an uninterested delivery boy into a hardened [[tÅge]] racer, showing how he learns techniques of racing without affecting his delivery load.  Takumi drives his father's (Bunta Fujiwara) [[Toyota Sprinter Trueno]] GT-APEX ([[Toyota AE86|AE86]]) which is seemingly unmodified but is perfectly suited for the downhill corners of Mt. Akina. This gains the attention of street racers across the prefecture. Some ultimately challenge Takumi to races on Akina's downhill, including Takeshi Nakazato who leads the NightKids team and drives a [[Nissan Skyline GT-R]] (R32). Ryosuke Takahashi, leader of the RedSuns team and a driver of the [[Mazda RX-7]] (FC) helps out Takumi by giving him advice and teaching him about car mechanics. Takumi agrees to race Ryosuke in three weeks.  While following the path of a street racer, Takumi must deal with his alcoholic father and his girlfriend Natsuki Mogi ([[Anne Suzuki]]). She's with an older man (who drives a [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]]) at a [[love hotel]] for two weeks as he takes on more difficult challenges.  With all the talk on Takumi's AE86, Takumi's close friend Itsuki Tachibana buys a new car after his [[Nissan Silvia]] gets totaled. He winds up swindled (mentioned by Itsuki's father) â getting an AE85 instead. Takumi was lured by Itsuki to teach driving down Mt. Akina. But halfway through, a member from the Emperor Team taunts them and almost makes them crash, which makes Takumi angry and successfully gets back at the Emperor Team's racer, where his [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]] IV crashed.  Takumi thus gains more fame, but the Emperor Team is mad. Afterward, his AE86 apparently breaks down mechanically after being bothered from a racer in the Emperor Team as payback, which led to Bunta dropping a new TRD 20-valve SilverTop racing engine and modifying the car. Takumi tests his new car, but is not used to the new mechanics, until Bunta teaches him how to drive right, and he becomes ready.  Takumi is bothered by Natsuki's absence. Despite a fight between Itsuki and him where Itsuki claimed he saw Natsuki coming out of a love hotel with her older partner, he impulsively declares Natsuki a slut (but apologizes). Takumi suspects something amiss about her. When Ryousuke and Takeshi arrive to pick him up for their duel, Takumi follows, but he briefly sees Natsuki with her older partner, which seems to confirm what Itsuki saw.  At the showdown, Ryosuke and Takumi race with the racer from the Emperor Team, Kyouichi. Ryousuke and Takumi handle their common opponent and work together. The Emperor Team loses when Kyouichi swerves to avoid hitting a car and refuses to listen to advice. The race then leaves only Takumi and Ryosuke; they take each other on. In the midst, Bunta explains the factors on Takumi's chances to win. Finally Takumi succeeds to win the event by beating Ryousuke at the last hairpin turn with the new car's mechanics that he learned.  After the race, at a convenience store Ryosuke offers Takumi a chance on a team composed of expert racers, of which Takumi has been undecided. He discovers his girlfriend being dropped off by the older partner. He confirms his suspicions of her and he runs away. She runs toward him. Outrunning Natsuki and back to his car, he tearfully drives away. He is upset and their relationship ends with Natsuki regretfully crying. Later Takumi apologizes to Itsuki and he joins Ryousuke's team as the film ends.

The Interpreter
 Silvia Broome ([[Nicole Kidman]]) is an interpreter working at the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City]]. She was born in the USA and spent most of her life in Africa (the Republic of Matobo, a fictional African country) and Europe, studied music in South Africa (Johannesburg), linguistics at the Sorbonne (Paris), and also in various countries in Europe. Her mother is British and her father a white African. Having been born in the USA, she holds American citizenship (as per the law of ''jure solis''). The U.N. is considering [[indictment|indicting]] Edmond Zuwanie ([[Earl Cameron (actor)|Earl Cameron]]), Matobo's president, to stand trial in the [[International Criminal Court]]. Initially a liberator, over the past 20 years he has become as corrupt and tyrannical as the government he overthrew, and is now responsible for [[ethnic cleansing]] and other atrocities within Matobo. Zuwanie is soon to visit the U.N. and put forward his own case to the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], in an attempt to avoid the indictment.  A security scare forces the evacuation of the U.N. building, and, as Silvia returns at night to reclaim some personal belongings, she overhears two men discussing an assassination plot in [[Ku (fictional language)|Ku]] (an African language she understands). Silvia runs from the building when those discussing the plot become aware of her presence. The next day, Silvia recognizes words in a meeting, where she is interpreting, from phrases she overheard the night before, and reports the incident to U.N. security; the plot's target appears to be Zuwanie himself. They, in turn, call in the [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]], who assign Tobin Keller ([[Sean Penn]]) and Dot Woods ([[Catherine Keener]]) to investigate, as well as protect Zuwanie when he arrives. Keller, whose estranged wife was accidentally killed just days earlier, learns that Silvia has, in the past, been involved in a Matoban [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla group]], that her parents and sister were killed by land mines laid by Zuwanie's men, and that she has dated one of Zuwanie's political opponents. Although Keller is suspicious of Silvia's story, the two grow close, in part because of their shared grief, and Keller ends up protecting her from attacks on her person. Silvia later finds that her brother Simon and her lover Xola were killed (as shown in the opening scene).  The purported assassin is discovered (and shot to death) while Zuwanie is in the middle of his address to the General Assembly, and security personnel rush Zuwanie to a safe room for his protection. Silvia, anticipating this, has been hiding in the safe room, and confronts Zuwanie and intends to kill him herself. Keller determines that the assassination plot is a [[false flag]] operation created by Zuwanie to gain credibility that his rivals are terrorists and to deter potential supporters of his removal. Keller rushes to the safe room and arrives just in time to prevent Silvia from murdering Zuwanie. Zuwanie is indicted, and Silvia is expelled from the U.S., returning home to Matobo soon afterwards.

Intermedio (film)
 In a small [[California]] town, Malik ([[Edward Furlong]]) along with his former girlfriend Gen ([[Cerina Vincent]]) her friend Barbie ([[Amber Benson]]), and another friend named Wes ([[Callard Harris]]) take a weekend getaway to an old [[ghost town]] where Malik and Gen played when they were younger.  They arrive at a long-abandoned prospecting settlement which is said to contain miles of underground tunnels, some of which lead to the [[Mexican border]] less than a mile away. The four friends climb down into the tunnels, and are observed by a mysterious old man ([[Steve Railsback]]) from a short distance away. He tugs on a mysterious [[amulet]] hanging from a chain around his neck and pours what appears to be blood on the ground.  In the tunnels, the teenagers stumble into two Mexican drug dealers, Jorge (Alejandro Samaniego) and Al, along with their teenaged sidekick Zee ([[Paul Cram]]), hauling packets of [[contraband]] across the border. The drug dealers force the four teenagers to tag along with them. Suddenly, mysterious [[ghost]]-like creatures appear and begin to attack them, forcing the teenagers and drug runners to join forces and run to the nearest hatch to try to escape. The mysterious old man is seen stroking his necklace, summoning the mysterious creatures. One of them throws a hook and chain at Al, impaling him to the wall.  Barbie is then sliced in half at the waist when she attempts to stand on Jorge's shoulders to open another hatch. Most of Jorge's fingers are severed as well. Zee seems to have disappeared, and the remaining survivors climb into a boarded up shack. One of the creatures stabs Wes through the neck. Jorge is also killed by the creatures.  Malik and Gen soon discover a room filled with dozens of bodies that have been killed over the years. Zee appears again and leads them to a path. Eventually the two safely escape the tunnels only to discover that they have lost the keys to their car, and they ask the owner of a nearby house for a ride. The owner turns out to be the mysterious old man, although neither of the survivors know he is the one behind the attacks.  As the old man drives the two away in his truck, he offers them some [[beer]]. Gen drinks it and soon passes out. The old man stabs Malik in the legs and then knocks him out with [[chloroform]].  Malik and Gen wake up back in the room filled with dead bodies, and after they each painfully remove the barbed wire binding their wrists, Gen discovers a small, narrow tunnel. They crawl under it and end up in the house of the old man. In the house they find a bedroom covered with newspaper clippings about a teenager named Zee who was murdered years earlier in the tunnels; the old man was a suspect in the killing. Zee reappears and shows them a passage underneath a bed. The old man soon finds the open passage and follows them into it.  Once again, the old man summons the ghostly creatures to attack the two survivors as they flee. Soon, Malik and Gen cross paths with the old man, who attacks them. The old man is about to murder Gen by slowly stabbing her in the neck when the previously silent Zee tells him to stop. Gen attacks the old man. Gen gets hold of the necklace and destroys it, and the creatures show up and kill the old man.  Later, Gen cuts herself with a knife, dripping her blood onto a rock as she says her  goodbyes to Wes. She meets up with Malik and they safely make it to the surface. At daybreak, they flag down another pickup truck and ask the driver for a ride.  In the final scene, Malik and Gen are safely in a motel room. Malik then muses over the old man's ability to control spirits, wondering whether they could then control them too, which Gen simply shrugs off. The movie ends showing Wes and Barbie's dead bodies staring at Malik and Gen through their motel room window.

The Island (2005 film)
 In 2019, Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta live with others in an isolated compound. Their community is governed by a set of strict rules. The residents believe the outer world has become too contaminated for human life with the exception of one contagion-free island. Every week, a lottery is conducted and the winner gets to leave the compound to live on the island.  Lincoln begins having dreams that he knows are not from his own experiences. Dr. Merrick, a scientist who runs the compound, is concerned and places probes in Lincoln's body to monitor his cerebral activity. While secretly visiting an off-limits power facility in the basement where his friend, technician James McCord, works, Lincoln discovers a live moth in a ventilation shaft, leading him to deduce the outside world is not really contaminated. Lincoln follows the moth to another section, where he discovers the "lottery" is actually a disguise to remove inhabitants from the compound, where the "winner" is then used for [[organ harvesting]], [[surrogate mother]]hood, and other purposes for each one's sponsor, who is identical to them in appearance.  Merrick learns Lincoln has discovered the truth, which forces Lincoln to escape. Meanwhile, Jordan has been selected for the island. Lincoln and Jordan escape the facility, and emerge in the Arizona desert. Lincoln explains the truth to her, and they set out to discover the real world. Merrick hires [[Burkina Faso|BurkinabÃ©]] mercenary and former [[GIGN]] operative Albert Laurent to find and return them unharmed to the compound.  Lincoln and Jordan find McCord, who explains that all the facility residents are clones of wealthy and/or desperate sponsors, who are kept ignorant about the real world and conditioned to never question their environment or history. McCord provides the name of Lincoln's sponsor in Los Angeles, and helps them to the Yucca [[maglev]] station, before mercenaries kill him. In New York City, Jordan's sponsor, model Sarah Jordan, is comatose following a car crash and requires transplants from Jordan to survive. Lincoln's sponsor, Tom Lincoln, gives Lincoln some explanation about the cloning institute, causing Lincoln to realize that he has gained Tom's memories. Tom agrees to help Lincoln and Jordan but secretly contacts Merrick, who sends Laurent and the mercenaries to their location. Lincoln tricks Laurent into shooting Tom, allowing him to assume Tom's identity.  Merrick surmises that a cloning defect was responsible for Lincoln's memories and behavior, resulting in him and every future clone generation to question their environment and even tap into their sponsor's memories. To prevent this, he decides to eliminate the four newest generations of clones. Lincoln and Jordan, however, plan to liberate their fellow clones. Posing as Tom, Lincoln returns to the compound to destroy the [[holographic projector]]s that conceal the outside world. Jordan allows herself to be caught to assist Lincoln's plan. Laurent, who has moral qualms about the clones' treatment after witnessing their fight for survival and learning that Sarah Jordan may not survive even with the organ transplants, helps Jordan. Lincoln kills Merrick and the clones are freed, seeing the outside world for the first time. Lincoln and Jordan sail away in a boat together.

Six weeks later, the trio is salvaging the ''Zephyr''. While trying to bring an old cannon to the surface, the rope breaks and the cannon sinks back down breaking a part of the ship. Jared is ready to call it a night, but Bryce dives in again and shouts that he has found gold.

It Waits
 In a remote national forest, five archaeology students discover a cave associated with an ancient Native American legend. Using explosives to gain entrance, they find [[Cave painting|prehistoric drawings]] and bones strewn across the cave floor. Suddenly from the shadows, a creature emerges and slaughters the students.  Two months later, forest ranger Danielle "Danny" St. Claire ([[Cerina Vincent]]) is sitting on the floor of an isolated ranger station tower in the same national forestâdrunk and crying. Remembering the tragic car crash that killed her best friend Julie Cassidy, Danny blames herself for the tragedy because she was driving after a night of heavy drinking. Her boss Rick Bailey ([[Greg Kean]]) calls to tell her she will be alone at the station for the next few days while her colleagues battle a forest fire. He also informs her that cracks have developed in nearby Devil's Gate Dam and instructs her to drain off water to relieve the pressure. That night, awakened by nightmares of the accident, Danny hears sounds coming from outside. With rifle in hand, she descends the tower to investigate and discovers claw marks on the tool shed door.  The next morning, Danny's forest ranger boyfriend Justin Rawley ([[Dominic Zamprogna]]) arrives to keep her company. After inspecting the dam, they return to the station for a romantic dinner during which Danny confesses she was the one driving the car when it crashed, and that she allowed the police to think Julie was driving. Justin consoles her and they make love. During the night, they're awakened by the sound of the emergency siren on the roof. They investigate and discover that something destroyed the satellite dish, rolled Justin's jeep over into a ditch, and disabled the radio. The next day, they go to the nearby dam to use its radio. They meet up with Carl and Evelyn Nashâtwo campers that recently went missing. Despite Justin's warnings, the Nashes head out on their own. Soon they are hunted down by the creature and killed. Meanwhile, at the dam, Justin and Danny find the radio room completely trashed. Later when they enter the station, Evelyn's bloody corpse swings down from the ceiling on a chain. When they rush outside, Carl's body is thrown off the roof onto them.  Justin heads off alone to get help. That night in the woods, the creature viciously attacks and kills him. The next morning, Danny notices the tool shed was broken into. Inside she finds Justin's severed head on a shelf and his bloody body on the roof. Danny buries Justin's remains and decides to fight back. That night the creature attacks the station, but Danny is able to shoot and wound it. The next morning, Danny discovers a trail of green gooey blood, and follows it to the cave. There, she meets the teacher of the students who were killed in the cave. He reveals what he knows about the creature, including some of its weaknesses. He also explains that the [[demon]] is drawn to Danny's negative energyâher guilt over her friend's deathâand provides her with documents about the ancient legend. Back at the station, Danny finds the dug-up corpses of the Nashes and Justin arranged around the table, with Justin's severed head on a plate. When it starts to rain, Danny remembers the teacher saying the creature doesn't like water. She goes off to hunt for the creature. When the rain stops, however, the creature attacks her, rips flesh from her leg, and then flies away. Back at the station, Danny finds the Nashes' cellphone and calls her boss Rick and tells him to bring the SWAT team, but he dismisses her request believing she's drunk.  The next day, Rick arrives at the station alone and accompanies Danny to the cave, which she plans to destroy with several sticks of dynamite. Soon they discover the teacher's body impaled on a pole in the middle of the road. The creature flies by and drops Justin's headless body onto Rick, crushing him to death. Danny drives off with the creature in close pursuit. As she approaches the cave, the creature lands on the hood and attacks Danny, who steers the vehicle directly into the opening of the cave, sending the creature flying inside. When it attacks one last time, Danny lights the dynamite and escapes just as the dynamite explodes, sealing the entrance with the creature trapped inside. Afterwards, Danny returns to the station, lays her ranger badge on the table, and then leaves. Sometime later, Danny tells a policeman about the killings, but says she doesn't know who did it. Then she explains that she was the driver in the accident that killed Julie, accepting responsibility for her friend's death.

The Jacket
 After miraculously recovering from an apparently fatal bullet wound to the head, [[Gulf War]] veteran Jack Starks ([[Adrien Brody]]) returns to [[Vermont]] in 1992, suffering from periods of [[amnesia]]. While walking, he sees a young girl, Jackie ([[Laura Marano]]), and her alcoholic mother ([[Kelly Lynch]]) in despair beside their broken-down truck. Starks and Jackie quickly form a certain affinity; she asks him to give her his dogtags and he does so. He gets the truck started for them and continues on his way. Shortly after, a man driving along the same highway gives Jack a ride and they get pulled over by a policeman.  The scene changes: Starks is found lying on the deserted roadside near the dead policeman, with a slug from the policeman's gun in his body. The murder weapon is on the ground nearby. Although he testifies there was someone else at the scene, he is not believed because of his amnesia. Starks is found not guilty by reason of insanity and is incarcerated in a mental institution.  Starks is placed in the care of Dr. Thomas Becker ([[Kris Kristofferson]]), a psychiatrist, and his staff. In December 1992, Starks is forced to undergo an unauthorized treatment designed by Becker: he is injected with experimental drugs, bound in a [[straitjacket]] and then placed inside a [[morgue]] drawer as a form of sensory deprivation. While in this condition, he is somehow able to travel 15 years into the future and stay there for a short time. He meets an older version of Jackie ([[Keira Knightley]]) at a roadside diner where she works. He suspects this happens because it is the only memory he can ever fully hold on to. She does not recognise him but seeing him standing forlornly, she takes pity on him and offers him shelter, just for the night. While in her apartment, Starks comes across his own dogtags and confronts her. Jackie, frightened, tells him that Jack Starks died on New Year's Day in 1993, and so he cannot possibly be who he says he is. She becomes upset and asks him to leave. Subsequently, Starks is transported back to the future on several occasions in the course of his treatment and, after earning Jackie's trust, they try to figure out how to make use of the time-travelling so as to remove Jack from the hospital and save his life.   Early on 1 January 1993, knowing that his time is quickly running out, Starks is briefly taken out of the hospital by Dr. Beth Lorenson, who he has finally convinced of his time travel experiences and his knowledge of future events. She drives Starks to the childhood home of Jackie and her mother, where he gives the mother a letter he has written, which outlines Jackie's bleak future and warns the mother that she is fated to orphan Jackie when she falls asleep with a lighted cigarette in her hand and is burned to death. When he returns to the hospital, Starks experiences a flashback to the head wound he suffered in Iraq, simultaneously slipping on the ice and hits his head. Bleeding profusely, he convinces two of the more sympathetic doctors to put him into the jacket one last time.  Starks returns to 2007, where he finds that his letter to Jackie's mother has made all the difference. Jackie now has a better life than in the previous version of 2007.  She is no longer a waitress, is now dressed in a nurse's uniform, and has a noticeably more cheerful outlook. They reprise their first 2007 meeting: she sees Starks standing in the snow and initially drives past him, but backs up when she notices his head wound. She stops and offers to take him to the hospital where she works. While they are in the car, Jackie receives a call from her mother â still alive and well. They drive on, the screen fades to white, and a voice-over reveals that the link to the "previous" future is not lost when Jackie says "How much time do we have?", a question she has asked him before. As the credits start to roll, the answer to the question is given by the words of the song: "We have all the time in the world" sung by Iggy Pop.  
Jack-Jack Attack
 This short film shows Rick Dicker, a government agent assigned to aid "supers" in maintaining their anonymity, interviewing Kari about the events that unfolded while she was babysitting the youngest member of the Parr family, Jack-Jack, during the events of ''[[The Incredibles]]''.  Kari begins by stating that she received a call from Mrs. Parr, who expresses reluctance about allowing Kari to babysit. Kari attempts to re-assure her that she is more than capable of taking care of Jack-Jack, but the conversation is cut off by the Parrs' plane being fired upon. Thinking nothing is wrong, and that they were simply cut-off, Kari turns her attention to Jack-Jack. She begins by playfully asking Jack-Jack if he is ready for [[Mozart effect|some "neurological stimulation"]]. She begins by playing [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)|Piano Sonata No. 11]] for him, which has the result of Jack-Jack having an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] about his latent superpowers.  When Kari's back is turned, Jack-Jack seems to disappear and reappear in the kitchen. Finding this odd, Kari tries calling Mrs. Parr again. While she is leaving a message, Jack-Jack floats onto the ceiling and spills milk onto Kari's face. Kari puts him in his playpen, flipped upside-down so that he cannot float away, and tries calling Mrs. Parr again. Jack-Jack promptly escapes the playpen, leaving a perfectly circular hole in the bars, and appears on a high bookshelf. Just as he falls, Kari dives in and tries to catch him, but fails when Jack-Jack passes through the floor into the laundry room. Running down to find him, Kari sees Jack-Jack passing through the walls and floating around, babbling happily, before she finally catches him.  Kari takes Jack-Jack back upstairs and ties him to a barbell. Then, to calm his laughing, Kari tries showing him [[flashcard]]s. This works well until she shows him a card of a [[campfire]], at which point he suddenly [[spontaneous human combustion|bursts into flames]]. Horrified, Kari picks up Jack-Jack with a pair of fireplace tongs and rushes into the bathroom, where she douses him in the bathtub.  The next day, all appears well from outside. Inside, the house is in shambles and Kari is teetering on the verge of madness, desperately struggling to stay awake, but having since learned to anticipate and counter the spontaneous outbursts of Jack-Jack's newly emerged (and quite numerous) powers. There is a knock at the door; Kari answers it and meets Syndrome, who asks if this is the Parrs' residence. Kari thinks he is the new babysitter come to relieve her, but wonders what the "S" on his costume stands for. He claims it stands for "Sitter", because if he called himself "Babysitter", his uniform would have to say "[[Bullshit|BS]]" on it.  Cutting back to the interrogation scene, Dicker is incredulous that Kari believed Syndrome, while Kari in her defense shouts that she was not in a sound state of mind at the time. Dicker asks Kari if she told anyone else about the incident, to which she replies that she did tell her parents, who didn't believe her and thought she was joking. As Kari expresses her wish to forget the whole thing, Dicker promises that she will, and activates a device to erase her memory.

The young man returns from [[Israel]] to find that he would prefer to leave Orthodoxy, and departs from his remaining family to become a taxi driver.

Jogi (film)
 The movie starts with [[Rajkumar (actor)|Rajkumar]] and [[Parvathamma Rajkumar]] blessings [[Shivarajkumar]] (as Madesha), explaining value of birth, prayers of baby for birth and parents in bit song.  The film is narrated in a non-linear fashion, with the use of several multiple flashbacks. In the opening scene, a dreaded underworld don is brutally hacked to death by unknown assailants. The police arrive at the crime scene and arrest the unknown assailant revealed as the superstar hero of the movie. The murder is revealed to be the handiwork of a novice, Madesha alias Jogi  who works in a roadside tea stall.  In the meantime, news about the murder reaches the echelons of the underworld. A rival gang of the slain don bails out Madesha from the lock-up and requests him to be their associate. Madesha rejects their offer and returns to his tea stall. An inquisitive trainee journalist Nivedhitha ([[Jennifer Kotwal]]) is eager to know about Madesha and requests an appointment with him. Despite trailing Madesha for several days, she is unable to interview him. Subsequently, she meets an old woman ([[Arundathi Nag]]) from a remote village, who has come in search of her lost son. After listening to her story, Nivedhitha assures her that she will locate her son.  In a flashback, it is revealed that the old lady's son is none other than Madesha. Madesha originally hailed from a village called Singanallur, Kollegal Taluk, South Karnataka and lived with his parents. His father ([[Ramesh Bhat]]) earned his living as a Jogi - a wandering minstrel, who went from one household to another and collected alms in return for singing. Due to the strenuous workload, he falls ill and dies. Enticed by his childhood friend, who flaunts his success, Madesha decides to try his luck in the city. However, in the city, he gets tangled with anti-social elements and ends up in jail. His anxious mother comes to the city in search of him.  Jogi is misled and convinced by underworld dons that if he takes up arms, it would be easy for him to find his mother. His mother dies before even seeing her son. Jogi, who does not know this, dances in front of her dead body. When he discovers that he performed the last rites of his mother without realising it, he is completely broken. On the other hand, the underworld men (who are introduced during the course of the movie) and who wanted to hack Jogi to death, also drop arms saying, "Jogi took up arms for his mother, for what reason are we fighting?". The movie thus ends with a message of peace and love for all.

Just like Heaven (film)
 Elizabeth Masterson (Witherspoon), a young emergency medicine physician whose work is her whole life, is in a serious car accident while on her way to a blind date. Three months later, David Abbott (Ruffalo), a landscape architect recovering from the sudden death of his wife, moves into the apartment that had been Elizabeth's, after 'discovering' it in what seems to be a fateful [[Wiktionary:happenstance#English|happenstance]].  Elizabeth's spirit begins to appear to David in the apartment with [[ghost]]ly properties and abilities that make it clear that something is not right. She can suddenly appear and disappear, walk or move through walls and objects, and once takes over his actions. When they meet, they are both surprised, as Elizabeth is still unaware of her recent history and refuses to think she is dead. David tries to have her spirit exorcised from the apartment, but to no avail. Since only David can see and hear her, others think that he is hallucinating and talking to himself.  David and Elizabeth begin to bond, as much as that is possible, and he takes her out of town to a beautiful landscaped garden he designed. Elizabeth tells him she senses she has been there before, and in fact, the garden was something she was dreaming of in the opening scenes of the film, where she was awakened by a colleague from cat-napping after working a 26-hour shift in the hospital.   Together, assisted by a psychic bookstore clerk, Darryl (Heder), Elizabeth and David find out who she is, what happened to her, and why they are connected. She is not dead, but in a [[coma]], her body being kept on [[life support]] at the hospital where she used to work. When David discovers that in accordance with her [[living will]], she will soon be allowed to die, he tries to prevent this by telling Elizabeth's sister, Abby, that he can see her and what the situation involves. One of Elizabeth's young nieces is revealed to be able to sense her presence as well.  Abby thinks David is mentally disturbed and drives him out of her house. Desperate, David decides to prevent Elizabeth's death by stealing her from the hospital. He asks his friend/therapist Jack to help him, and Jack is found to be actually Abby's former college boyfriend, who had set up a blind date for David with Elizabeth on the night of the accident - the reason David can see Elizabeth is that they were meant to meet. He then admits to Jack and Elizabeth that he loves her and that is the reason he does not want her to die; he has gotten past the death of his wife. While stealing Elizabeth, they are quickly discovered in the hospital. The security guards find them, pulling Jack away from Elizabeth, but when he is grabbed, her breathing tube is removed. David gets away from the guards a bit longer, but Elizabeth is now dying. David frantically kisses the dying Elizabeth, breathing some air into her lungs, while her spirit begins to fade away. Then, amazingly, her heartbeat returns and she miraculously awakens from the coma. However, the recovered Elizabeth does not remember anything that happened during the coma or any of the events with David, who leaves the hospital in sadness.  Sometime later, Elizabeth goes back to her apartment. She is drawn up to the roof of the building, which has been transformed into a beautiful landscaped garden. She finds David there, who has gotten in with a spare key Elizabeth's spirit had shown him. Just as he is about to leave, she asks for her key back. When their hands touch, her memory of the events during her coma are restored, and they kiss.  
Joyeux NoÃ«l
  The story centres mainly upon six characters: Gordon (a Lieutenant of the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]]); Audebert (a French Lieutenant in the 26th Infantry and reluctant son of a general); Horstmayer (a [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish]] German Lieutenant of the [[93rd Infantry Division (German Empire)|93rd Infantry]]); Palmer (a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] priest working as a stretcher-bearer); and German tenor Nikolaus Sprink and his [[Danish people|Danish]] fiancÃ©e, mezzo-soprano, Anna SÃ¸rensen (two famous opera stars).  The film begins with scenes of schoolboys reciting patriotic speeches that both praise their countries and condemn their enemies. In Scotland, two young brothers, Jonathan and William, join up to fight, followed by their [[Priest (Catholic Church)|priest]], Father Palmer, who becomes a [[chaplain]]. In Germany, Sprink is interrupted during a performance by a German officer announcing a [[Military reserve force|reserve]] call up. Audebert looks at a photograph of his pregnant wife, whom he has had to leave behind (in the [[German occupation of north-east France during World War I|occupied part]] of France, just in front of his trench), and prepares to exit into the trenches for an Allied assault on German lines. However the assault fails with the French and Scottish taking many casualties while William loses his life.  In Germany, Anna gets permission to perform for the soldiers and Sprink is allowed to accompany her. They spend a night together and then perform. Afterward, Sprink expresses bitterness at the comfort of the generals at their headquarters, and resolves to go back to the front to sing for the troops. Sprink is initially against Anna's decision to go with him, but he agrees shortly afterward.  The unofficial truce begins when the Scots begin to sing festive songs and songs from home, accompanied by [[bagpipes]]. Sprink and SÃ¸rensen arrive in the German front-line and Sprink sings for his comrades. As Sprink sings "[[Silent Night]]" he is accompanied by a piper in the Scottish front-line. Sprink responds to the piper and exits his trench with a small Christmas tree singing "[[Adeste Fideles]]". Following Sprink's lead the French, German, and Scottish officers meet in [[no-man's-land]] and agree on a [[cease-fire]] for the evening. The various soldiers meet and wish each other "Joyeux NoÃ«l", "Frohe Weihnachten", and "Merry Christmas". They exchange chocolate, champagne, and photographs of loved ones. Horstmayer gives Audebert back his wallet, with a photograph of his wife inside, lost in the attack a few days prior, and they connect over pre-war memories. Palmer and the Scots celebrate a brief [[Eucharist|Mass]] for the soldiers (in [[Latin]] as was the practice in the [[Catholic Church]] at that time) and the soldiers retire deeply moved. However, Jonathan remains totally unmoved by the events around him, choosing to grieve for his brother.  Father Palmer is being sent back to his own parish and his Battalion disbanded as a mark of shame. Despite emphasising the humanity and goodwill of the truce, he is rebuked by the [[Bishop (Catholicism)|bishop]], who then preaches an [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] sermon to new recruits, in which he describes the Germans as inhumane and commands the recruits to kill every one of them. Father Palmer overhears the preaching, and removes his cross as he leaves.  Back in the trenches, the Scots are ordered by a furious major (who is angered by the truce) to shoot a German soldier who is entering no-man's-land and crossing towards French lines. The soldiers deliberately miss in response but the German soldier is hit by a bitter Jonathan. Audebert, hearing the familiar alarm clock ringing outside, rushes out and discovers that the soldier is a disguised Ponchel, his [[Batman (military)|batman]]. With his dying words, Ponchel reveals he gained help from the German soldiers, visited his mother, and had coffee with her. He also informs Audebert that he has a young son named Henri.  Audebert's punishment is being sent to [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and he receives a dressing down from his father, a general. In a culminating rant, young Audebert upbraids his father, expressing no remorse at the [[Fraternization|fraternisation]] at the front, and also his disgust for the civilians or superiors who talk of sacrifice but know nothing of the struggle in the trenches. He also informs the general about his new grandson Henri. Moved by this revelation, the general then recommends they "both try and survive this war for him".  Horstmayer and his troops, who are confined in a train, are informed by the [[William, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince]] that they are to be shipped to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], without permission to see their families as they pass through Germany. He then stomps on JÃ¶rg's harmonica, and says that Horstmayer does not deserve his [[Iron Cross]]. As the train departs, the Germans start humming a Scottish [[Christmas carol|carol]] they learned from the Scots, ''L'Hymne des FraternisÃ©s'/ I'm Dreaming of Home''.  
Just Friends
  In 1995, Chris Brander ([[Ryan Reynolds]]) is an [[Obesity|overweight]] high school student with a lisp, braces, and a "gentle giant" demeanor who secretly has a huge [[Crush (love)|romantic crush]] on his classmate and best friend Jamie Palamino ([[Amy Smart]]). After confessing his feelings by writing them in Jamie's [[yearbook]], he attends Jamie's graduation party. As he returns the yearbook to her, it is secretly swapped by her despicable ex-boyfriend, Tim ([[Ty Olsson]]), who reads the declaration aloud to everyone and humiliates Chris. Jamie doesn't reciprocate his [[romantic feelings]]; after they share a brief kiss on the cheek, Tim and the class burst in and humiliate Chris again. While Jamie admonishes them, an enraged Chris tearfully leaves the party, announcing that he would never return and vows to be more successful than everyone.  Ten years later, Chris has lost weight, is handsome, and lives in [[Los Angeles]]; he is a womanizer who has dated supermodels, starlets, and socialites, works as a highly successful record producer and also holds a position of senior vice president of the same record corporation he works for. Prior to Christmas, Chris's employer, company CEO KC ([[Stephen Root]]), asks Chris to accompany an emerging self-obsessed [[pop music|pop]] singer named Samantha James ([[Anna Faris]]) to Paris to ensure she signs with their label, an order to which Chris reluctantly complies. During the trip to Paris, Samantha accidentally sets her private jet on fire resulting in an emergency landing in [[New Jersey]], near Chris's hometown.  Chris takes Samantha to his mother's house to spend the night and re-engages with his teenage past, including his unresolved feelings for Jamie. Samantha meets Chris's mother and 18-year-old brother Mike ([[Chris Marquette|Christopher Marquette]]) who has an enormous crush on Samantha. At the local bar, Chris encounters some old classmates, including his other best friend Clark ([[Fred Ewanuick]]) and Clark's wife Darla ([[Amy Matysio]]); he also encounters Tim, who is now balding, fat, and a heavy drinker. Jamie also appears, working as a bartender to support herself through graduate school.  Chris plans to impress and seduce Jamie. He gets Mike to keep Samantha busy during his date with Jamie, but the realization that Jamie's [[Platonic relationship|platonic friendship]] is important to him hampers Chris's plan. During a friendly ice skating "day date", Chris is taken away in an ambulance after injuring himself. At the scene, Jamie is reunited with Dusty Dinkleman ([[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]]), a paramedic and former high school nerd who was also [[Romantic love|romantically in love]] with her.  That night, in an attempt to rectify his situation, Chris again leaves Samantha in Mike's hands and takes Jamie to a movie showing of ''[[The Notebook (2004 film)|The Notebook]]''. Jamie, however, brings Dusty along, and Chris's mother ends up joining them, ruining Chris's plan. Meanwhile, Samantha plays a gig at the heavy metal club that Chris sent her to, gets booed off the stage and assaults a member of the audience.  The next night, Chris goes to Jamie's for a Christmas party, planning to reveal his feelings for her, but he finds Dusty already there winning the guests over with his charm and musical talents. Back at Chris's place, Samantha ambushes Mike and pushes him against the bathroom wall demanding to find out Chris's location; fully aware of his feelings, she passionately tongue kisses him until he tells her where Chris has gone. In a rage, she drives to Jamie's house and crashes through her fence, destroying her family's Christmas decorations. Chris returns home in embarrassment, and Jamie follows him; she tells him she is not mad and they end up spending the night together catching up and looking at photos, but due to Chris's continuing lack of assertion, the two end up falling asleep and no [[Romance (love)|romance]] ensues.  The next day, Jamie speaks with Darla about the night before and her fear that Chris's lack of affection means that he doesn't like her. Jamie admits that while the two are "just friends", she tried to "put herself out there" to Chris, to show Chris that she ''is'' interested in a relationship. Meanwhile, Chris goes to Clark's medical office to get advice, saying that "the timing wasn't right" and Jamie and Chris's history hinders his willingness to have sex with her. Outside the office, they happen to catch Dusty singing to a sexy nurse and then kissing her. Dusty reveals to Chris and Clark that he only plans to have sex with Jamie, as he wants to humiliate her in the same way that he felt she used to humiliate him when he was a nerd and she was the object of his crush.  Chris tries to warn Jamie, but instead ends up attacking Dusty in front of her; Jamie refuses to listen when Chris tries to explain. Chris consequently gets drunk and goes to the bar where Jamie works, finding her there with Dusty. Jamie refuses to listen and Dusty tries to convince her to have sex with him. When Jamie gently turns him down, Dusty storms out of the bar. Chris and Jamie get into another fight, with him blaming her for keeping him in the "friend zone" and saying that she "peaked in high school" and will never amount to anything. Jamie punches Chris and he is tossed out of the bar.  Upon returning to LA and having a frightening reunion with Samantha (who sneaks into Chris's house to "surprise him"), Chris realizes that Jamie ''is'' his one and only true love. He returns to New Jersey hoping to finally be with her. Chris declares his genuinely intense [[romantic love]] for Jamie at her house and the two share a kiss outside, in view of the neighborhood kids.

Kaalpurush
 The film tells the story in a non-linear fashion, with two timelines being depicted simultaneously. [[Rahul Bose]] has a dysfunctional marriage with [[Sameera Reddy]] who has an extra-marital affair.. Rahul tries to reconnect with his long-lost father (played by [[Mithun Chakraborty]]), while Sameera dreams of breaking free of her stifling domestic life. Rahul is considered as a failure both in professional and personal lives. However, an honest and simple man, he clings to simple joys of life and memories of his childhood. The back-and-forth movement of the story between two timelines (the present day and Rahul's childhood) and the arrangement of the sequences make Mithun a mystery manâhe could be dead, alive, or, just a figment of Rahul's imagination. [[File:Kaalpurush.jpg|thumb|left|260px|[[Laboni Sarkar]], portraying the character of Mithun's wife in the film]] The film begins as Mithun follows Rahul as the later returns home from a day's work. Rahul is shown to be a doting father, but a failed husband. Mithun then starts to tell his own story. He had a happy family with wife ([[Laboni Sarkar]]) and the adolescent son Sumanata. A past flame of Mithun, played by [[Sudipta Chakraborty]], incidentally arrives in the village (as a part of a masked dance troup) and meets Mithun. At one unrestrained moment, she tries to seduce Mithun. Mithun tries to resist. However, Mithun's wife, Laboni, sees a glimpse of them in a compromising situation. Laboni, pained by the betrayal, decides to leave Mithun, with their son in tow. While a devastated Mithun becomes a footloose traveller, their son bears the scar for the rest of his life. Back to the present, father and son come face to face to heal old wounds.  Battling the brunts of a society that defines success too materialistically, Rahul also continues to relive his childhood memories. His wife, Sameera, meanwhile flies to the United States to spend an extended holiday with her brother's family settled there. She writes several travelogues. Rahul suddenly meets his father one day in a [[Calcutta]] street. He spends a memorable day with his father, reliving their memories, as well as discussing many aspects of life. Suddenly, Mithun disappears.  Rahul's wife returns from USA, and tells him that she has been in an extra-marital relationship for long, and their children are actually not fathered by Rahul. Rahul says he knows everything, and still love their children. Soon, Sameera leaves Rahul. Rahul continues to live with their children.  Towards the end of the film, Rahul again has a talk with his father, Mithun. Mithun tells him that many things in life remain unsaid, untouched. Mithun goes on to tell that after Mithun's wife, Laboni, left him, he wandered off to many places, finally one day, committing suicide.

There, he undergoes painful [[reconstructive surgery]], turning him into an Inhumanoid himself. Unlike the original series, he does not escape prior to [[brain washing|mental condition]] by Shocker, and becomes one of their soldiers, nicknamed "Hopper". He carries out a mission successfully, and meets Shocker's Major Agents, including [[Dr. Shinigami]]. Hongo receives his orders&mdash; Kill those who have seen Shocker's Inhumanoid soldiers. However, what he doesn't realise is that the two witnesses are the journalist who had interviewed him prior to his kidnapping, Asuka Midorikawa ([[Rena Komine]]) and her fiancÃ© Katsuhiko Yano ([[Hassei Takano]]). Attacking the two along with Shocker soldier Spider, it is here that Hongo remembers his humanity, and has an epiphany with regards to what he should do. Despite his efforts, Katsuhiko is killed by Spider, and Asuka finds Hongo next to the body. Blaming him for Katsuhiko's death, she begins to follow him, attempting to ascertain why who she thought was a normal college student is a murderer.  Meanwhile, at Shocker headquarters, it is revealed that those who undergo Shocker's treatment need periodic [[blood transfusion]]s, lest they reject their cybernetic components. Though Hongo seems to lack the need for the transfusions, he is labeled a "traitor" by Shocker and must be destroyed. It is here that Dr. Shinigami reveals his plan to create a second soldier based on Hopper's design to do the job. Hongo, having now abandoned Shocker, visits [[TÅbei Tachibana]], who gives him his [[motorcycle]], the Cyclone. He is then able to defeat Spider. Asuka meets Hayato Ichimonji, who is identical to her fiancÃ©, who she thought was dead. He reveals that "Katsuhiko Yano" was an alias.

The two had undergone the reconfiguration and surfaced in the current story as Shocker soldiers Cobra and Snake, who branded Ichimonji a traitor for failing Shocker by putting his feelings for Asuka first.  Ultimately, the Riders team up after Bat attempts to kidnap Asuka and turn her into an Inhumanoid, which enrages Ichimonji enough to cause him to turn on his former masters. They defeat Shocker's three cyborg soldiers at their island base, but Shinigami and other Major Agents have survived, and they're already in the fashioning of a new base of operations while plotting a new scheme to eliminate Riders, once and for all.  
Kamen Rider Hibiki & The Seven Senki
  Hibiki and Asumu are on their way to a Makamou attack on the beach. Once they arrive there, they see dozens of people running from the massive Orochi, a beast rumored to be the strongest Makamou ever created. Once they arrive, Hibiki walks towards the Orochi and transforms, but all of his attacks prove useless against Orochi. The situation is made even more dire when Hibiki jumps in the way of an attack meant for Asumu. Taking the full force of the attack, Hibiki passes out as the Orochi swims away, leaving a panicking Asumu to get help. Hibiki ends up in the hospital and Asumu begins blaming himself for Hibiki's injuries. Feeling useless, he begins helping at Tachibana's, going through dozens of books to try to discover a way to defeat the Orochi. Upon coming across a book with his name on it, Asumu sits down and begins to read what turns out to be the history of Takeshi, the Oni and the Makamou war.  In the [[Sengoku period]], a young boy who has the same resemblance and name as Asumu is wandering around with his childhood friend Hitoe. In this time, the humans all knew and feared the Makamou, sometimes forced to sacrifice one of their own to spare an entire village from the Makamou's wrath. Suzu was such a case as she was offered up as the yearly sacrifice to the Orochi to keep it from killing the villagers. After some protesting from the girl's father, the man was killed by Douji and Hime before Suzu and her father's [[corpse]] were consumed by the Orochi. A year later, a mark appears upon Hitoe's hand, making her as the next sacrifice to the Orochi. Asumu, unwilling to let her meet such a fate, sets out to find a way to stop it. Meeting the village elder Tobei and the others for such a means, learning the only way is to bring an [[Oni (folklore)|Oni]], though many villagers see them to be no different than the Makamou, despite the fact that they fight the monsters. Asumu understands the danger but insists on setting out in spite his own history with an Oni. Tobei sends along his daughters, Kazue and Hinako, to help.  The group then enters a town being attacking by a Makamou called Kaendaishou before it is defeated by an Oni named Kabuki who has been hired by the town's people to defeat the Makamou. After realizing that the people can only pay him with food, Kabuki offered some a younger boy, but the boy's mother quickly slaps the food away from the boy due to the taboo of humans' contact with the Oni. Learning of Asamu's blight, Kabuki offers his aid after telling him they need to gather allies to help them against the Orochi. To that end, Kabuki takes Asumu's group to find a small home where a former Oni named Hibiki lives. Asumu instantly declares his hatred for this man as he believes him to be the one that killed his brother. Asumu's older brother, Takeshi, was the apprentice to Hibiki and was killed one day in a [[rock slide]]. Asumu found Hibiki carrying his brother's body and assumed that Hibiki was his brother's killer. Without Hibiki, the group moves on to find the next Oni; Ibuki. They find Ibuki, who aided in the war and became daimyo. But bored with his life as a feudal lord, Ibuki quickly takes care of his court and leaves with the group. The group then heads on to a small [[temple]], where they recruit a [[buddhist priest]] named Touki after Kabuki attempted to throws a rock at him to test his buddhist abilities.  The Oni then try to trick the Makamou by setting Ibuki up as the sacrifice in Hitoe's place. After finding out it was all a trick, the Makamou then attack Ibuki, who is quickly aided by Kabuki and Touki, the latter making quick work of the couple with his freezing power. But the Orochi then shows up and forces the Oni to leave the battle as the Douji and Hime threaten the villagers for their attempted defiance by giving them a month to redeem themselves or suffer the plague that they have inflicted on the girl. After Kirameki arrives too late for the fight, the group sets out to gain more partners. As the Douji and Hime discuss how to deal with their eventual meddling, the Oni group make a stop in a village, with Asumu following them until he is attacked by a group of Samurai and unknowingly being saved by Hibiki. The group then learn of Nishiki, the Oni thief who is to be executed for his crimes. The group comes to witness his public beheading, but Nishiki surprises everyone by catching the sword to be used in his beheading with his teeth. He then escapes and joins the group, who are being watched by a young girl that turns out to be a Makamou named Hitotsumi who specializes in killing Oni.  The Oni then find Habataki, who first refuses to join them now that he has a wife and son. However, Habataki agrees to join the group only after his wife persuades him to take up the cause again as long as he returns to her alive. While they are traveling, they find Todoroki being attacked by Bakegani. Nishiki, Habataki and Kirameki help him dispatching the Oni before he tells them that Hibiki sent him to help them out. Back at Asumu's village, Hitoe illness worsens as she has gone to a cave to hide, with a group of villagers looking for her as the Oni returned. The villagers are found murdered later, with Nishiki's weapon at the scene. The house where the Oni are staying is then burnt down, and the Oni are told by the villagers that Nishiki's weapon was found at the sight of the murders and Hitoe saw the murderer to be an Oni. The group of Oni then get into a fight over the situation if they should fight back against the humans or not, but the fight is broken up once Hibiki comes along. It is then revealed to Asumu that Hibiki did not kill his brother, and that his brother was crafting a special sword for him.  Hitoe is then brought home, identifying Kabuki as the one who killed the villagers and left Nishiki's weapon there to frame him. Though Hibiki and Asumu were confused, Kabuki reveals his intentions as he and Kaendaishou attack Hibiki, the two get away without Hitoe. The group of Oni then break up and head their own ways, but before doing so, Todoroki returns Hibiki's tuning fork and Disc Animals to him. While this occurred, before taken to be sacrificed, Hitoe takes Asamu to the cave he and brother played, finding a katana that Takeshi made for Hibiki before his death. Asumu makes his way to Hibiki as Kabuki ambushes him at his home, handing Hibiki the katana and asking him to fight for the memory of his brother. Taking the request to heart, Hibiki transforms and fends off Kabuki after killing Kaendaishou. After a long battle Hibiki, defeats Kabuki as he and Asumu make their way to the beach as Hitotsumi devours Kabuki. Arriving, Hibiki begins fighting with a massive group of Ninja Makamou as Asumu saves Hitoe. But outnumbered, the tie turns when the other Oni arrive to help Hibiki, killing Hitotsumi and the Douji/Hime pair. The battle goes on until Hibiki comes head to head with the Orochi. At the climax of the battle, the katana is swiped away from Hibiki's hands and into the sea.  In the present, Asumu sees that the last page to the book is missing and not showing how that battle ended. Asumu then finds out that Hibiki is well and fighting the Orochi again. Sensing a presence in the nearby cave, Asumu finds the katana from the story he read and hands it to Hibiki, changing into the Armed Saber as he becomes Armed Hibiki and defeats the Orochi. In the past, in aftermath of their win over the Makamou army, Hibiki and the other Oni take their leave to be of service elsewhere. As the villagers rebuild their home, they decide that a human and Oni partnership would be best for both sides in the future, with Asumu naming this group "Takeshi", honoring the memory of his brother.

She is then sentenced by the judge ([[Roger Hammond (actor)|Roger Hammond]]) to a secure unit for the criminally insane for [[manslaughter]] on the grounds of diminished responsibility.  Forty-three years later, in the village of Little Wallop, Walter Goodfellow, the [[vicar]] ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) is very busy writing the perfect [[sermon]] for a convention, having no idea about the problems in his house. They include the unfulfilled emotional needs of his wife Gloria, ([[Kristin Scott Thomas]]) who subsequently starts an affair with her golf instructor, Lance ([[Patrick Swayze]]); the sexual desires and growing maturity of his teenage daughter, Holly ([[Tamsin Egerton]]) who is constantly finding new boyfriends; and son, Petey (Toby Parkes) who is being bullied at school. Then, everything changes with the arrival of the new housekeeper, Grace ([[Maggie Smith]]).  Grace becomes entrenched in the life of the family and begins to learn about the problems in the house: the neighbour, Mr. Brown's dog [[Jack Russell terrier]], Clarence, who consistently disturbs Gloria's sleep by his nuisance barking; the bullying of Petey; and Gloria and Lance's affair. Grace commits to solving the problems in her own way.   She kills Clarence, and when Mr. Brown finds out that his dog has been murdered (after long assuming he had run off), she kills him, too. She sabotages the brakes on the bullies' bicycles, injuring one of them, thereby making Petey very happy. After catching the golf instructor outside the house videotaping Holly undressing one night, she kills him with an iron.   While Walter is preparing his sermon for the conference, Grace introduces him to humour and suggests adding it to his preaching method. Further, she discovers that he has let his relationship with his wife slide on account of his devotion to God, and she teaches him that he can love his wife as well as God by drawing his attention to the erotic references in the [[Song of Songs|Song of Solomon]]. As the problems in the household seem to gradually clear, Walter leaves for his convention.   Graceâs habits are discovered when Gloria and Holly see her picture on television in a news story mentioning her release and previous offences. It is then that Grace reveals that she is Gloria's long-lost mother, Rosie Jones, explaining why she came to Little Wallop in the first place. After briefly processing the influx of information, Gloria argues and attempts to explain that when having a problem with someone, one cannot just kill them. Grace remarks that this is the one thing she and her doctors could never agree on. Despite their disagreements, Gloria tries to help Grace with Lance's body, but cannot handle it. Over a cup of tea, the three women decide not to tell Walter or Petey any of what has happened.  When nagging congregant, Mrs. Parker ([[Liz Smith (actress)|Liz Smith]]) comes over to discuss the problem of the "church flower arranging committee", Grace, under the false (and likely paranoia-induced) impression that Mrs. Parker is about to turn them in for their crimes, attempts to hit her over the head with a frying pan, but is prevented by Gloria. Mrs. Parker, shocked by the attempt to murder her, has a heart attack and dies. Walter returns from the convention just then and sees Mrs. Parker's body, but doesn't realise she is dead. Soon after this, Grace leaves the family when order is seemingly restored among the family.

Kicking & Screaming (2005 film)
  Phil Weston ([[Will Ferrell]]), is an average person who had to endure his father Buck Weston's ([[Robert Duvall]]) over-competitiveness throughout his childhood, an upbringing which has left permanent mental scars. Now middle-aged and married, with a young son named Sam, Phil runs a small [[Dietary supplement|vitamin]] store, while Buck operates a local chain of sports stores.  Buck is coach of the Gladiators, the most successful little-league soccer team in the district. Sam is on Buck's soccer team, but to his dad's annoyance his grandfather keeps him on the bench, a humiliation he also visited upon his son decades prior. Buck eventually transfers Sam to the Tigers, the league's worst team.  At Sam's first game with his new team their coach is absent. Rather than forfeit, Phil decides to coach the team, a position he takes up permanently. However, despite Phil's best efforts the team does not seem to improve. In desperation Phil recruits [[Mike Ditka]] (played by himself), who is Buck's neighbor and hated enemy. Enticed by the opportunity to beat Buck, Ditka accepts the position. Despite grueling training, the team continues to lose.  Ditka introduces Phil to two exceptionally talented Italian boys working in a local butcher's shop. Phil succeeds in gaining their Uncle's permission for them to play for the Tigers. They have an immediate impact, scoring repeatedly. The resulting winning streak makes them serious contenders in the league. After finally winning a couple of games and Phil said that his team was going to go to the finals, Phil and Buck make a bet, if the Gladiators win then Phil would sell his store and work for Buck. If the Tigers win then Buck would hand over his most prized possession, 'The [[PelÃ©]] Ball', a soccer ball struck by the famous player which Phil caught as a child and Buck took from him.  Meanwhile, Ditka also introduces Phil to coffee, which rapidly changes him from a mild-mannered caring dad, to an obnoxious, egotistical, over-competitive coach, not that different from his father, abusing kids and parents alike. The team's mantra becomes "Get the ball to the [[Italians]]", which, though effective, demoralizes his team. In the ultimate over-competitive act he benches his own son for the entire semi-final game.  The Tigers make it to the finals where they face off against the Gladiators. At half-time, the score is two-one to the Gladiators. In a heart-to-heart discussion with his son, Phil realizes the error of his ways. He tells his team to do exactly the opposite of what he taught them. Although the Gladiators score one more goal after half-time, they don't give up hope. Phil gives the goalie a vision test with glasses from the crowd. From there, Ambrose scores one goalâmaking the score three-two. After another goal, the score is tied. The team rallies and produces a spectacular team performance to win 4-3, with Sam scoring the winning goal against his uncle Bucky ([[Josh Hutcherson]]), (Buck's child who was born on the exact day as Sam) using a move that he practiced when his dad benched him in the semi-finals.  Honoring the bet, Buck tries to give Phil the ball, but Phil refuses. Making peace with his father, they merge their businesses, realizing there is more to life than winning.  The film ends with an adapted version of the "He's Got Balls" commercial originally produced by Buck. In it, the entire Tigers team appear, announcing the merger of Phil's vitamin shopâPhil's Pillsâand Buck's Sporting Goods Store. The team shouts, after the "He's got balls" line, "And vitamins."  Closing credits are set to a cover [[The Beatles]] song [[We Can Work It Out]].

Killer Pickton
 Billy Pickton ([[Curtis Graan]]) is with his attorney ([[Christian Behm]]) in a police interrogation room, about to be questioned by a police detective ([[Michael Barbour]]) and district attorney ([[Rachael Devlin]]). As the detective and district attorney converse about Billy's case, the movie is told in flashback.  Billy is shown running a severed pig's head and hoofs up and down the body of a prostitute ([[Jacqueline Horrell]]), in a strangely sexual sequence, as the detective narrates.  Billy's ''modus operandi'' of luring prostitutes to his sister's expensive home to drug and kill them is shown in a series of episodes. His first victim ([[Lauren Kruskall]]) is drowned in a bath tub, placed in a large wheeled trash can, taken to the family pig farm, and fed into a woodchipper. The remaining episodes follow a similar pattern. The next victim, played by [[Kate Hackett]], is drugged and abused in one of the bedrooms of Billy's sister's house. The abuse is interrupted by a housekeeper ([[Marilyn Cortez]]), who quietly observes Billy move the drugged woman into a trash can and wheel her to the pig farm. There, he suffocates her and feeds her hand into a meat grinder.  Billy forces alcohol down the throat of the next victim ([[Jillian Swanson]]). He drags the incapacitated woman around the house, up the stairs, forcing her to swallow pills before killing her. She is later fed to the woodchipper.  Throughout the film, the detective implies and then finally accuses Billy of mixing the remains of the victims with pork meat that was then sold to a national food market chain for public consumption. In flashback dinner scenes with his sister ([[Jill Pennington]]) and brother ([[Frank Godek]]), Billy does not answer questions about why the pork products "taste so good."  After the next victim ([[Anjeannete Stairs]]) is strangled and buried alive, Billy is interrupted by three teenage hitch hikers, one of whom he treats for a spider bite before sending them on their way, unharmed. Billy narrates how his mother made an audio recording of his father's ([[Carsten Frank]]) death, which forever colored his view of women as "evil whores." There is a brief flashback of Billy dancing and frolicking with a prostitute ([[Nicole Polec]]), and attending church.  Billy's next victim, Annie ([[Heidi Rhodes]]), is treated to a tour of the house attic, and their relationship starts to take a bizarre romantic tone. She reads an [[Edgar Allan Poe]] poem to Billy before he drugs herâshe wants him to kill her. However, he cannot bring himself to feed Annie to the woodchipper, because as the detective intones, "She was the only woman he ever cared for."  In the pig farm basement, the brother discovers Billy and Annie's corpse, which leads to Billy's arrest. The movie ends with title cards that explain that Billy may have killed "as many as 135 ... unfortunate women."

Kingdom of Heaven (film)
  In 1184 France, [[Balian of Ibelin|Balian]], a [[blacksmith]], is haunted by his wife's recent suicide. A Crusader passing through the village introduces himself as Balian's father, Baron Godfrey of [[House of Ibelin|Ibelin]], and asks him to return with him to the [[Holy Land]], but Balian declines. After the town priest reveals that he ordered Balian's wife beheaded before burial, Balian kills him and flees the village.  Balian joins his father, hoping to gain forgiveness and redemption for himself and his wife in [[Jerusalem]]. Soldiers sent by the bishop arrive to arrest Balian, but Godfrey refuses to surrender him, and in the ensuing attack, Godfrey is struck by an arrow that breaks off in his body, leaving a wound that would prove fatal days later.  In [[Messina]], Sicily, Godfrey knights Balian and orders him to serve the [[King of Jerusalem]] and protect the helpless, then succumbs to his injuries. During Balian's journey to Jerusalem his ship runs aground in a storm, leaving Balian the only survivor. Balian is confronted by a Muslim cavalier, who attacks him over his horse. Balian reluctantly slays the cavalier but spares the man's servant, and the man tells Balian that his deed will gain him fame and respect among the [[Saracens]].  Balian becomes acquainted with Jerusalem's political arena: the [[Leprosy|leper]] King [[Baldwin IV]]; [[Raymond III of Tripoli|Tiberias]], the Marshal of Jerusalem; the King's sister, [[Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem|Princess Sibylla]]; and her husband [[Guy de Lusignan]], who supports the anti-Muslim activities of brutal factions like the [[Knights Templar]]. After Baldwin's death, Guy intends to break the fragile truce with the sultan [[Saladin]] and make war on the Muslims.  Guy and his ally, the cruel [[Raynald of ChÃ¢tillon]], attack a Saracen caravan, and Saladin advances on Raynald's castle [[Siege of Kerak|Kerak]] in retaliation. At the request of the king, Balian defends the villagers, despite being overwhelmingly outnumbered. Captured, Balian encounters the servant he freed, who he learns is actually Saladin's chancellor [[Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani|Imad ad-Din]]. Imad ad-Din releases Balian in repayment of the earlier debt. Saladin arrives with his army to besiege Kerak, and Baldwin meets it with his. They negotiate a Muslim retreat, and Baldwin swears to punish Raynald, though the exertion of these events weakens him.  Baldwin asks Balian to marry Sibylla and take control of the army, knowing they have affection for each other, but Balian refuses because it will require Guy's execution. After Baldwin dies, Sibylla succeeds her brother, and Guy becomes king. Guy releases Raynald, asking him to give him a war, which Raynald does by murdering Saladin's sister. Sending the heads of Saladin's emissaries back to him, Guy declares war on the Saracens and sends assassins to kill Balian, though Balian survives the attempt.  Guy and the Templars march Jerusalem's army to war, despite Balian's advice to remain near water. Saladin's army annihilates the Crusaders in [[Battle of Hattin|the ensuing desert battle]], executes Raynald, and marches on Jerusalem. Tiberias and his men leave for [[Cyprus]], believing Jerusalem lost, but Balian remains to protect the people in the city, knighting the men of the city. After a [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|siege that lasts three days]], a frustrated Saladin parleys with Balian. When Balian reaffirms that he will destroy the city before surrendering it, Saladin agrees to allow the Christians to leave safely in exchange for Jerusalemâthough he ponders if it would be better if there were nothing left to fight over.  Balian is confronted by the disgraced Guy one final time, but defeats and spares him. In the marching column of citizens, Balian finds Sibylla, who has renounced her claim as Queen. After they return to France, English knights en route [[Third Crusade|to retake Jerusalem]] ride through the town to enlist Balian, now the famed defender of Jerusalem. Balian tells [[Richard I of England|the crusader]] that he is merely a blacksmith again, and they depart. Balian is joined by Sibylla, and they pass by the grave of Balian's wife as they ride toward a new life together. An epilogue notes that "nearly a thousand years later, peace in the Holy Land still remains elusive."

Ann learns her favorite playwright, [[Jack Driscoll]], is the screenwriter. As their [[tramp steamer]], the SS ''Venture'', journeys to the mysterious [[Skull Island]], Ann and Jack fall in love. People on the ship consist of Englehorn the captain, Hayes, a World War One veteran, Lumpy the cook, Choy the janitor, the ''Venture''s lookout Jimmy and at least several other sailors. Captain Englehorn has second thoughts about the voyage, prompted by Lumpy and Hayes' speculation of trouble ahead.  Deep in the southern waters, the ''Venture'' receives a radio message informing Englehorn that there is a warrant for Carl's arrest due to his defiance of the studio's orders to cease production. The message instructs Englehorn to divert to [[Yangon|Rangoon]], but the ship becomes lost in fog and runs aground on the rocky shore of Skull Island. Carl and his crew explore the island and are attacked by natives, who kill Mike as well as one of the sailors. Ann screams as she is captured, and a loud roar is heard beyond a wall. After this, the matriarch of the tribe targets Ann, muttering the word "Kong". Englehorn kills one of the natives and his crew break up the attack and return to the ship. They lighten their load to float off the rocks and carry out repairs, but Jack discovers Ann has been kidnapped and another sailor has been killed. The natives offer Ann as a sacrifice to Kong, a  tall gorilla. The crew returns fully armed, but is too late as Kong takes Ann and flees into the jungle. Ann wins Kong over with juggling and dancing, and begins to grasp Kong's intelligence and capacity for emotion.  Englehorn organizes a rescue party, led by Hayes and Jack. Carl's crew, Lumpy, Choy. Jimmy (disguised in ski cap but later discovered by Hayes), and several other sailors come along. They encounter and kill a ''Ferrucutus''. The rescue party is then caught in the middle of a pack of ''[[Skull Island#2005 remake|Venatosaurus saevidicus]]'' and the herd of ''[[Skull Island#2005 remake|Brontosaurus baxteri]]'' they are hunting, and four people are killed, including cameraman Herb. The rest of the rescue party come across a swamp where Baxter and two others leave the group. The rest cross the swamp on rafts, only to be attacked by "[[Skull Island#2005 remake|Scorpio-pedes]]", as well by a "[[Skull Island#2005 remake|Piranhadon]]", which devours three sailors. The rescue party is making their way across a fallen log over a ravine when Kong attacks. Five crewmen, including Hayes and Choy, are killed after being thrown off the log, and the rest of the crew ride the log down the ravine and land in a pit. Preston however, doesn't fall down as he is able to cling to a vine from the falling log. Kong returns to Ann and rescues her from three ''[[Skull Island#2005 remake|Vastatosaurus rex]]''. Kong takes her to his lair in the mountains. The remaining rescue party find the pit to be full of giant insects. Lumpy is killed by the maggot-like ''[[Skull Island#2005 remake|Carnictics sordicus]]'' while two others are killed by spider-like creatures. Englehorn, Baxter and the two crewmen return, saving Jack, Jimmy, Carl, and Preston. As Jack continues searching for Ann, Carl decides to capture Kong. Jack goes to Kong's lair, inadvertently waking him and provoking a swarm of flying ''[[Skull Island#2005 remake|Terapusmordax]]''. As Kong fights the swarm, Ann and Jack escape. They arrive at the wall with Kong pursuing them, and Ann becomes distraught by what Carl plans to do. Kong bursts through the gate and attempts to get her back, killing several sailors, but is subdued when Carl knocks him out with [[chloroform]].  In New York City, Carl presents "''Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World''" on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], starring Baxter and an imprisoned Kong. Ann is played by an anonymous chorus girl, and Kong becomes enraged after realizing that the girl on stage is not Ann. After breaking free from his [[chrome-steel]] chains, he wrecks the theater and chases Jack and attempts to search for Ann as well. Kong knocks Jack out by stopping his car and flipping it, then encounters Ann again. Kong and Ann share a moment on a frozen pond in [[Central Park]] until the U.S. Army attacks. Kong climbs with Ann onto the top of the [[Empire State Building]], where he fights off six [[Curtiss Falcon|F8C-5 Helldiver]] Navy planes, downing three. Kong is mortally wounded by the planes' gunfire, and gazes at Ann for the last time before dying and falling from the building. As Ann is reunited with Jack, civilians, policemen, and soldiers gather around Kong's corpse. Carl makes his way through the crowd, takes one last long look at Kong and says, "It wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast."

King and the Clown
 Set in the late 15th century during the reign of [[Yeonsangun of Joseon|King Yeonsan]], two male street clowns and tightrope walkers, Jangsaeng ([[Kam Woo-sung]]) and Gong-gil ([[Lee Joon-gi]]), are part of an entertainer troupe. The [[effeminate]] and beautiful Gong-gil specializes in female roles ; their manager prostitutes him to rich customers, and Jangsaeng is sickened by this practice. After Gong-gil kills the manager in defense of Jangsaeng, the pair flee to Seoul, where they form a new group with three other street performers.  Together the group comes up with a skit mocking some members of the [[Joseon dynasty|royal court]], including the king and his new [[concubine]] [[Jang Nok-su]]. Though they make a lot of money from the performance, they are eventually arrested for treason and flogged severely. Jangsaeng makes a deal with Choseon, one of the king's consultants, either to make the king laugh at their skit or to be executed. They perform their skit for the king, but the three minor performers are too terrified to perform well. Gong-gil and Jangsaeng barely save themselves with one last joke at the king, who laughs and then makes them all a part of his court.   When the king wants to see more performances, the clowns decide to make flyers asking for other minstrels to audition to join the group. The other clowns notice that Jangsaeng and Gong-gil have identical handwriting, as Jangsaeng learned to write by watching Gong-gil. The corruption within the court is revealed when the clowns put on a performance ridiculing the council members by implying that they receive expensive gifts for favours. The king is delighted by the skit, but upon seeing that the council members are not amused, turns on them and asks them one by one if they are guilty of what the clowns are mocking them for. He banishes a corrupt minister and orders that his fingers be cut off and displayed to all the other council members as a member.  Over time, the king falls for Gong-gil, whom he calls to his private chambers often to perform finger puppet shows. Jangsaeng becomes jealous of this relationship and suggests that they leave, but Gong-gil does not immediately agree. Meanwhile, the king becomes more and more unstable. He makes the clowns perform a [[Farewell My Concubine (play)|skit]] depicting how his mother (played by Gong-gil), the favorite concubine of the former king, was forced to take poison after being betrayed by other jealous concubines. The king then slaughters these concubines at the end of the play, and the Queen Mother dies from shock. Jangsaeng then asks Gong-gil to leave with him and the gang once more before the king kills them too during one of his homicidal fits. Gong-gil, who initially sympathized with the king, begs the tyrant to give him his freedom but the king refuses.   The king's main concubine, Jang Noksu, becomes increasingly enraged by the attention the king has been lavishing on Gong-gil. The council members try to have him killed during a hunting trip, resulting in the death of one of the members of the street performing team. Days after the hunting trip, the king forcibly kisses Gong-gil and his violence against the members of his own court escalates, especially at the mention of his father who he feels still rules over the kingdom even after his death. This leads the performing troupe to finally decide to leave the palace, because the king has become too unpredictable, but Gong-gil begs Jangsaeng not to leave him alone as he is not allowed to leave the palace. Then, Jang Noksu tries to have Gong-gil jailed by having flyers run in Gong-gil's handwriting insulting the king severely. Jangsaeng takes the blame for the crime for which Gong-gil has been falsely accused, as their handwriting is the same, and is set to be beheaded the next morning.  Choseon secretly releases Jangsaeng, however, telling him that he should forget Gong-gil and leave the palace. But Jangsaeng ignores the advice and returns to walk on his tightrope across palace rooftops, this time openly and loudly mocking the king. The king shoots arrows at him while Gong-gil tries in vain to stop him. Jangsaeng falls and is caught, and has his eyes seared with burning iron as punishment before being thrown into prison again. Gong-gil attempts suicide, but his life is saved by the palace doctors : the king then loses interest in him and goes back to his consort.   The king has Jangsaeng walk his tightrope blind. As Jangsaeng tells the story of his and Gong-gil's trials and tribulations while balancing on the rope, Gong-gil runs out to join him. Gong-gil asks Jangsaeng what he would like to return as in his next life and Jangsaeng replies that he would still choose to be a clown. Gong-gil answers that he too would return as nothing else but a clown. At the very end there is a popular uprising resulting in an attack on the palace, and as people storm the court, Jangsaeng and Gong-gil jump up from the rope together, and Jangsaeng tosses away his fan. The last scene is a happy one where Jangsaeng and Gong-gil appear to be reunited with their clowning troupe, including the friend who died earlier during the hunting incident. The whole company jokes, sings and dances, as they all walk away cheerfully into the distance.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>

When the food in the fridge runs out, Keld starts eating every night at a Chinese restaurant across the street from his apartment. The pipes in the restaurant explode and Keld agrees to fix them in exchange for his meals. After about a month, the owner of the restaurant, Feng (Lin Kun Wu), offers Keld DKK 24,000 (US $4,000) to marry his sister, Ling (Vivian Wu), so that she can get a visa. Keld initially refuses, but when faced with the divorce settlement, Keld goes back to Feng and asks for DKK 50,000. Feng agrees.  After a lavish wedding, Ling moves into Keld's apartment which is set up to fool the immigration service. Ling and Keld learn to live with each other despite the language barrier. Keld freely tells his wife and son that the marriage is purely "pro forma". Keld is concerned about Ling's health but Feng assures him she's perfectly fine. Ling's influence gradually lifts Keld up out of his apathy.  Rie attempts to reconcile with Keld. When that fails, Rie threatens to call the cops on Keld and Ling's marriage unless she gets her money immediately. Keld goes to Feng to get his money, but Feng says the wedding cost too much and he doesn't have the cash.  Angry, Keld storms home and has a fight with Ling, despite neither of them being able to understand the other.   Keld goes over to Feng's restaurant looking for Ling. A fellow patron of Feng's restaurant advises Keld that love must be professed. Feng comes through with the money, so Keld pays Rie and crushes any hope of reconciliation between them because he is in love with Ling. When bringing his lunch, Ling overhears Keld practicing saying "I love you" in Chinese. That evening, washing the dishes as Ling waits for Keld to get up the nerve to say it, Ling collapses. Keld takes her to the hospital but it's too late. Feng confesses he knew Ling had a genetic heart defect, the reason why he had wanted her to live in Denmark. Ling is cremated and Keld flies to China to scatter her ashes in the ancestral river.  
The King Maker
 The story opens with [[Portugal|Portuguese]] soldier Fernando de Gama drowning in the ocean after a shipwreck. He comes to, finds some wreckage to float on and washes up on the coast of [[Thailand|Siam]]. After almost being eaten by a [[crocodile]], he is captured by [[Arab people|Arab]] slave traders and taken to [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Ayutthaya]]. Released from his bonds to be put on the auction block, he promptly knocks down his captors and leads them on a chase throughout the ancient city.  Eventually, he is brought under control, but not before he is captured the attention of a [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] beauty, Maria, who buys him his freedom back. After recovering from his recapture, Maria brings Fernando to meet her father, Phillippe. Fernando immediately recognizes Phillippe as the man who killed Fernando's father many years ago, whom Fernando has been seeking on a lifetime quest for revenge.  But there are bigger battles to be fought. Fernando and his Portuguese compatriots are pressed into the service of [[Chairacha|King Chairacha]], who has to go into battle. It is a multi-national taskforce, not only including Portuguese mercenaries, but also samurai warriors (likely Christians expelled from Japan). In battle, Fernando bonds with a Thai warrior named Tong. They distinguish themselves by saving the King from an assassination attempt and are appointed his personal bodyguards.  Queen Sudachan, a former royal [[Queen consort|consort]] who schemed her way into becoming queen, is behind the assassination plot. Because it failed, she calls on Don Phillippe for help. Phillippe in turn enlists a scar-faced [[ninja]] to kill the king. This plan is also thwarted by Fernando, Tong and other Siamese troops.  After the assassins are killed in the king's bedroom, King Chairacha assigns Tong and Fernando the task of seeking out whoever is behind this scheme.  Recognizing one of the dead assassins as the scar-faced ninja he had seen Phillippe talking with earlier that night, Fernando confronts Phillippe.  They fight, and Phillippe is killed by Tong. Meanwhile, the queen resorts to black magic to poison the king. She also must kill her own son, [[Yodfa|Prince Yodfa]] (who is next in line for the throne), to clear the way for her boyfriend [[Worawongsathirat]]. This she achieves by hiring a spear-wielding African warrior.  Succeeding in her plot, Fernando and Tong are then framed for the deaths and made to fight each other in a death duel for Queen Sudachan, her new king, and the crowd's amusement. Tong's family and Maria's life are threatened, and Tong throws an axe at Worawongsathirat, slaying him. Moments before the queen kills Tong and Fernando in revenge, King Chairacha's brother [[Maha Chakkraphat]] arrives. Having deduced on his own that the queen is behind the king and prince's deaths, he arrests the queen and releases our heroes and their loved ones. In an ending text, it is stated that news of these events were heard by the king of Burma, and that the story's impression of disarray is what caused the [[BurmeseâSiamese War (1548â49)|Burmese invasion]] and the eventual decline and destruction of Ayutthaya.

The group arrives at the fuselage to learn that it's not part of the plane they crashed in. In addition, the radio and critical instruments have been stripped and removed. They are startled by the arrival of [[Professor Challenger|Lieutenant Colonel Challenger]] ([[Bruce Boxleitner]]), who managed to travel alone to the downed plane,  carrying a briefcase he doesn't seem to want to part with.

However, the sacrificial ceremony fails when a giant ape attacks, and Dana (who faked being brainwashed) saves Ed. They meet up with Challenger and Rita, then spot military jets overhead, moving in to attack the giant ape, but are destroyed. Challenger is killed by a native, leaving Ed alone to fight the ape.  Ed detonates a nuclear bomb from a crashed plane and successfully kills the ape, but also destroys their cockpit, trapping  Ed, Rita, and Dana in the jungle.

He also encounters his childhood crush Harmony Lane but wakes up in bed with her hostile friend. He runs over to Harmony's place at 6 a.m. to apologize.  During a stakeout, Perry and Harry witness a vehicle being dumped in a lake and are spotted by the apparent killers. Perry realizes there's something in the trunk of the car and shoots the lock in a rescue attempt but accidentally hits the female corpse inside as well. They cannot report the body because it appears Perry killed her.  Harmony contacts Harry, explaining that her sister Jenna came to Los Angeles, stole Harmony's credit cards, and later killed herself. Believing Harry is a detective, Harmony asks him to investigate Jenna's death as a murder. After she leaves, Harry discovers the lake corpse in his bathroom and a planted pistol. Harry and Perry dump the corpse, later identified as Veronica Dexter by police. Harry discovers it was Harmony's credit card that was used to hire Perry to come to the lake, tying Jenna to their case. He goes to see Harmony, who accidentally slams the door on his finger, cutting it off, and she takes him to the hospital.  At a party where Harmony is working, Harry is abducted, beaten, threatened, and ordered to cease the investigation by the killers from the lake and then let go. While taking Harry back to the hospital, Harmony sees the killers heading to Perry's stakeout.

Perry travels back to Harmony's hometown and confronts Jenna's father, who is now bed-ridden, slapping him multiple times and calling him an animal. When the old man berates Perry for attacking a helpless old man, Perry says simply, "Yeah, that's right. Big tough guy," and leaves.

Kinky Boots (film)
 In the town of [[Northampton]], in the [[East Midlands]] of [[England]], Charlie Price is attempting to save the family shoe factory, which has been floundering since his father died. While on a business trip to London to sell the company's extra stock, Charlie encounters a woman being harassed by drunken hoodlums and intervenes to his detriment. He wakes up backstage, in the dressing room of Lola, a [[drag queen]] performer and alter ego of Simon. Charlie is intrigued when he sees that drag queens' [[high heels]] snap easily since they have only women's shoes to wear, rather than those that can support the weight of a larger male body frame. Back in Northampton, while in the process of laying off workers, one employee, Lauren, gives Charlie the idea of looking for a niche market product to save the business. Charlie then recruits Lauren to assist him in designing a high-heeled boot for drag performers.  When their initial designs are met with scorn by Lola, Charlie and Lauren bring her on as a consultant. The road is initially bumpy: many of the male employees are uncomfortable with Lola's presence and the new direction, and Charlie's relationship with his fiancÃ©e, Nicola, begins to deteriorate as she encourages him to sell the factory building to a real estate developer. Although things improve when Lola tones down her personality and starts making friends, matters take a turn for the worse when Charlie is invited to showcase the new boots in [[Milan]]; the strain he puts on his employees causes most of them, including Lola, to walk out.  Charlie's fiancÃ©e arrives at the factory, furious that he took out a second mortgage on their house to save the company. Nicola insists that he sell the company, but Charlie is determined to save it and the jobs of his employees. The argument (which ends with Nicola leaving Charlie) is broadcast on the factory's PA system, which is overheard by Lauren and Lola's bitterest opponent at the factory, Don, a chauvinistic male worker. Don turns over a new leaf after Lola had graciously allowed him to win an arm wrestling match, and rallies the factory workers to make the boots in time for Charlie and Lauren to get to Milan. When Charlie catches Nicola with another man, he angrily takes out his frustrations on Lola, causing Lola to quit. After arriving in Milan with no one to model the boots, Charlie is forced to go onstage and model the boots himself. After tripping and ultimately falling flat on his face, Lola and her posse of drag queens arrive, put on a spectacular runway show, and save the day.  In the film's denouement, Lola headlines her own show and sings a song in honor of the "kinky boots factory" of Northampton. Most of the key workers are in attendance and enjoying themselves, including Charlie and Lauren, who have become a couple.

Konjiki no Gash Bell!! Movie 2: Attack of the Mecha-Vulcan
   The movie begins with a mysterious figure, Dr. M2, rallying a group of robots that he calls Death Mechanics (which all look like gigantic robotic blue versions of Vulcan, a plastic box with wooden sticks for arms that Kiyomaro "gifted" to Gash). He orders one of the units, Death 18, to kidnap Kiyomaro.  Meanwhile, Kiyomaro is rushing to get to the bus for Coast School, since he slept in late. He leaves Gash behind, who chases after Kiyomaro. During the chase, Vulcan, who Gash brought along with him, is partially broken. Stuck in a tree and unable to stop Kiyomaro, Gash asks him if he'll at least fix Vulcan, but Kiyomaro says that he'll "make him a new one". As Kiyomaro tries to chase the already-moving bus down, his friends spot him and try to tell the others to stop the bus. However, while they're not paying attention, Death 18 swoops down from the sky and abducts Kiyomaro, carrying him away and leaving his friends baffled. Once Kiyomaro arrives at Dr. M2's lab, he is contained inside an orange bubble. Dr. M2 then orders Death 18 to go down and distract Gash to keep him away from Kiyomaro by making Gash think that he's his friend.  As Gash walks home, he thinks about the previous versions, or "generations", of Vulcan that had been ruined in the past (leading up to the third that he currently had), and how they are all important friends of his. Screaming out that Kiyomaro's an idiot, Naomi, the local bully, believes that Gash was talking about her, so she starts pummeling him. However, Death 18 comes down from the sky and interrupts her. As he's about to harm Naomi, Gash realizes that he looks just like Vulcan, and tells him not to hurt Naomi. Naomi runs off and Death 18 fixes Gash's Vulcan. Gash thinks that Death 18 is another Vulcan that Kiyomaro built, and calls him "Yondaime", or "Fourth Generation". Gash and Vulcan then ride in Yondaime's giant mouth into town.  In Dr. M2's lab, the demon explains that Kiyomaro is to be his new partner, and that he can take Kiyomaro to the future demon world. Dr. M2 shows Kiyomaro the Death Mechanics, but Kiyomaro tells him that they're just rip-offs of Vulcan. To prove him wrong, Dr. M2 shows Kiyomaro a robotic model of Vulcan from the future that Kiyomaro will someday build; however, as a prototype, it's loaded up with bugs. Dr. M2 had realized that the best way to fix the Death Mechanics was to have Kiyomaro repair them. Kiyomaro asks Dr. M2 whether the battle to decide the next ruler of the Demon World is still going on, but Dr. M2 simply states that he isn't interested in that battle, leaving it vague. Dr. M2 offers again to bring Kiyomaro to the future, but he refuses. Dr. M2 tells him that the idiots of his time can't understand him, but Kiyomaro says that Gash changed his view of people around him.  Meanwhile, after venturing into town, Gash and Yondaime go under a bridge and find graffiti. As the two start painting the walls themselves, Gash paints "Yondaime" in Kanji onto the robot's body. Gash's demon friends, Tio, Kanchome, and Umagon, then arrive under the bridge. While Kanchome is terrified by Yondaime, Gash explains that he is a present from Kiyomaro, so the five of them then play together in the park. As Dr. M2 opens the portal to the future to return with Kiyomaro, a dark cloud is created over the city. Citizens of Mochinoki Town are advised to leave, and there is mass panic. Gash says that they should all go to investigate, but Yondaime's programming makes him try to keep them all away. After much prodding from Gash, though, Yondaime realizes that he and Gash have become friends, and he changes his mind. The four demons get into Yondaime's mouth and, revealing that he can fly, Yondaime soars towards the cloud.  Upon entering the dark cloud, they discover Dr. M2's giant floating castle. Infuriated that Death 18 disobeyed his orders, Dr. M2 tries to reprimand him, but the robot doesn't respond. Kiyomaro manages to break free from his prison and communicates with Gash using a giant monitor on the side of the castle. Dr. M2 summons all of the Death Mechanics to fight off Gash and the others, but Kiyomaro manages to get Gash to fire his Zakeru spell, blasting away the Death Mechanics' missiles. The attack also tears a hole in a part of the castle, though, leaving Kiyomaro to fall from the sky; however, Yondaime manages to catch him.  Kiyomaro gets ready to attack the army of Vulcans, but Gash, believing them all to be Vulcans and, therefore, all his friends, runs towards them to try to talk to them, while Yondaime keeps Kiyomaro restrained. The Vulcans don't respond to Gash's words, though, and all begin to pummel him. Tio, Kanchome, Umagon, and Yondaime all try to hold back the Vulcans from attacking him, but to no avail. As all of the Vulcans try to take Kiyomaro, Gash yells at them to stop. They all stop momentarily, but are immediately called back to the castle by Dr. M2. One of Dr. M2's lightning bolts hits Yondaime, reverting him to his original programming. Despite Gash's efforts, Yondaime flies off to join the others, who all fuse together with the castle to become one giant Vulcan.  As the giant Vulcan attacks the group, Megumi, Folgore, and Sunbeam all arrive in a car together to help fight it off. During the scuffle, Megumi casts Giga Ra Seushiru, causing the giant Vulcan's attack to reflect back at it, making it collapse. Gash asks again if they can stop attacking, saying that since they're all Vulcans, they're all his friends. Kiyomaro angrily snatches Gash's Vulcan from his hand, saying that it's just a toy made from chopsticks and a paper box that he scrapped together. Gash tearfully reminds Kiyomaro that Vulcan was the first friend that Kiyomaro ever made for him. Shaken by Gash's statement, Kiyomaro says that the only reason he wanted to go to Coast School was because his friends would be there. Kiyomaro had been alone, thinking that the world was boring and stupid, until Gash had come along and taught him the importance of friends. Kiyomaro comes to tears as he says that, although Gash made many friends for Kiyomaro, the only friend that he could give Gash was a toy made of paper box and chopsticks, yet Gash still cherishes it so much. Everyone agrees that, because Vulcan is Gash's friend, he is their friend as well, and will help protect all of the Vulcans. With newfound understanding and determination, Kiyomaro comes up with a plan to stop the Vulcans without destroying them.  The four demon and human pairs coordinate attacks and trick Dr. M2 into opening the power reactor on the front of the enormous Vulcan to attack; however, before he can, Gash and Kiyomaro jump in the way and fire Zakeruga at the reactor, destroying it. When the giant Vulcan collapses, Gash sees that Yondaime is all right, and he hugs him.  Suddenly, the storm around them intensifies, and everyone realizes that if they don't seal the time-space hole, then the entire Earth will be destroyed. Kiyomaro grabs Dr. M2, asking him to fix it. Dr. M2 reveals that if the destroyed reactor is fixed, the hole will close, but there would need to be a large amount of power to reactive it. Gash states that they could provide the power to activate the reactor, and Dr. M2 realizes that everyone's combined power could repair it.  As Dr. M2 floats in the sky in the core of his castle, the four demons cast a series of spells to channel power into the reactor, ending with Kiyomaro casting Gash's most powerful spell, Baou Zakeruga, to guide it. However, their efforts are unsuccessful, and the temporarily closed gate opens once more. Yondaime then flies up, attaching himself to the reactor. Dr. M2 realizes that Gash could strike the reactor still active in Yondaime to get the main reactor working again, but Gash says that he could never shoot Yondaime. As Gash cries, Yondaime begins talking to him; however, the one sending the message through Yondaime it is in fact the Vulcan prototype, which is revealed to contain Kiyomaro's recorded voice. He says that they will always be friends, whether they are together or apart; he speaks not only as Yondaime, but also as the future Kiyomaro who no longer has Gash with him. Redetermined, Gash and Kiyomaro launch a gigantic Baou Zakeruga, which crashes through Yondaime and splits into three heads, starting up the reactor. As Dr. M2 sits in the castle, holding the prototype Vulcan in his lap, he quietly wonders to himself if the transmission element that Gash and Kiyomaro used to guide the reactor can guide even himself. The three Baou Zakerugas fly into the cloud, successfully closing the hole and leaving Dr. M2's fate unknown. The giant Vulcan then separates back into the smaller Vulcans, who fly away into the sky. Gash asks Kiyomaro if he can ever see Yondaime again, but Kiyomaro responds that he'll build him an even better Vulcan; an even better friend.  
Kousek nebe
 The film, set in a Czechoslovak prison in the 1950s, focuses on the romantic relationship between two unjustly sentenced inmates, LuboÅ¡ and Dana, as they try to survive under hard prison conditions.  
Lady Vengeance
 A [[Christian]] musical procession waits with a symbolic block of [[tofu]] outside a prison for the release of Lee Geum-ja ([[Lee Young-ae]]), a recently reformed female prisoner. Convicted of kidnapping and murdering a 5-year-old schoolboy, Won-mo, 13 years earlier, Geum-ja became a national sensation because of her young age, angelic appearance, and eager confession to the crime. However, she became an inspirational model for prisoner reform during her incarceration, and her apparent spiritual transformation in prison earned her an early release on her sentence. Free, Geum-ja is now intent on revenge.  Donning blood-red eye shadow and cutting off her little finger, Geum-ja quickly shows that her "kind-hearted" behavior in prison was a cover to earn favor and further her intricate revenge plans. Once paroled, Geum-Ja visits the other paroled inmates, calling in favors that include food, shelter, and weapons. She also begins work in a pastry shop and starts an affair with the shop assistant, Geun-Shik, who would be the same age as the murdered schoolboy Won-mo, had he lived.  It is revealed that Geum-ja did not smother Won-mo. The detective on her case was aware of her innocence, but helped her fake certain crime-scene details to ensure her confession looked credible. As a young high school student, Geum-ja had become pregnant and, afraid to go home to her parents, turned to Mr. Baek ([[Choi Min-sik]]), a teacher from her school, for help. Mr. Baek expected Geum-ja to provide sex and assist in his kidnapping racket in return. He used Geum-ja to lure 5-year-old Won-mo to him, with the intent of ransoming the child, but unintentionally killed the boy. He then kidnapped Geum-ja's infant daughter and threatened to murder the baby if Geum-ja did not take the blame. Geum-ja spent 13 years in prison planning revenge on Mr. Baek for the murder of Won-mo, causing Geum-ja's child to grow up without a mother, and for sending Geum-ja to prison in his place.      Geum-ja discovers that her daughter was adopted by Australian parents. Jenny, now an adolescent, does not speak Korean and does not initially embrace her mother, though she returns with Geum-ja to [[Seoul]] to bond. Geum-ja plans to kidnap and murder Mr. Baek, now a children's teacher at a preschool, with the aid of his wife, another ex-convict. Mr. Baek, who knows Geum-ja has been released, attacks his wife, Geum-ja and Jenny. In the ensuing battle, Geum-ja kills the thugs, while Mr. Baek is subdued.  Mr. Baek wakes up gagged and tied to a chair in an abandoned schoolhouse. Geum-ja, eager yet hesitant to kill him, threatens him. On his cell phone strap, she discovers the red marble from Won-mo's crime scene. It had been taken as a trophy. She is horrified to see several other children's trinkets also hanging from the strap. She rips his apartment apart to discover [[Snuff film|snuff]] [[Videotape|tapes]] of the other children that he murdered. He had not been part of a ransoming racket; he would kidnap, torture, and murder a child from each school he worked at because he found small children annoying. After killing each child, he would fake a ransom call to the parents, collect the money, and move on to a different school.  Sickened that four more children died because Geum-ja did not turn in the real killer 13 years ago, Geum-ja and the original case detective contact and transport the parents and relatives of the missing children to the school. After watching each tape, and being told Mr. Baek is in the next room, the group decides to murder him together. They take turns on Mr. Baek until the last person, an emotionless grandmother, kills him with the school scissors of her murdered granddaughter. They take a group photo, ensuring that none of them can turn in the others without implicating themselves, and bury the corpse outside.  Geum-ja, the detective, and the relatives all converge at Geum-ja's bakery, where they eat a cake and sing a birthday song for their deceased children. Afterwards, Geum-ja sees the ghost of the murdered child. Before she can ask him for her long-awaited redemption, he transforms into his grown self (the age that he would have been if he had lived) and gags her. Later, Geum-ja is walking down a street in the dark night while the snow is falling where she meets Jenny. They embrace before Geum-ja opens the cake box she is holding, revealing a white cake that resembles tofu. She instructs her daughter to "live white", as pure as tofu. Jenny says Geum-ja should live even more purely. Geum-ja weeps uncontrollably, while Jenny hugs her. Behind them stands Geun-Shik, who have followed her, staring up at the falling snow while Geum-Ja and Jenny hug each other.  
Kyon Ki
 The story begins at Sir Richard's Mental Sanatorium, run by the strict and authoritative Dr. Khurana ([[Om Puri]]), along with the other two main doctors, Dr. Sunil ([[Jackie Shroff]]) and Dr. Tanvi Khurana ([[Kareena Kapoor]]), who is the daughter of Dr. Khurana. Dr. Tanvi has treated a female patient ([[Sulabha Arya]]) who wears no. 36 with love and proper care, rebelling against Dr Khurana's inhumane ways of dealing with mentally ill patients. As she gets discharged, Tanvi doesn't get acknowledged for her efforts, which devastate her and since then, has become embittered and vows to never come close to any patient, especially no. 36.  Anand ([[Salman Khan]]) is brought to the mental sanatorium by a court order. His elder brother requests the doctors to admit him immediately. However, they insist on evaluating his mental condition before taking any decision. On being asked a few questions, Anand does not show any signs of insanity, and the doctors conclude that there is nothing wrong with him. Just then, Anand spots a housefly on the table. He tries to capture it but it evades him. While Anand's brother insists with the doctors, Anand suddenly becomes very violent, picking up a club and using it to hit everything the fly lands on. This convinces the doctors that he is indeed insane, and they finally admit him.  In the sanatorium, Anand tries to makes friends with other patients. Dr. Sunil develops a caring bond with Anand, which is revealed that Sunil was made a doctor by Anand's father ([[Firdaus Mavawalla]]). Anand makes a commotion almost everyday and acts childish which upsets Tanvi and demands that Anand be thrown out from the asylum.   A flashback ensues when Tanvi finds out about Anand's sad past. Anand was a musician in college who was deeply in love with Maya ([[Rimi Sen]]) in Romania. Maya was a nun and did not reciprocate her love towards Anand, until he threatens to commit suicide on the rooftop of the church by pretending to set fire on himself. Therefore, Maya ran and confessed her love towards Anand and they plan to get married. Maya throws a series of pranks on Anand, such as pretending to not ride a horse, when she can ride perfectly and driving the car perfectly, albeit in a dangerous manner, when she said she couldn't drive. Anand desires to get back at her and pranks by throwing her into a swimming pool, thinking she can swim but cannot. Afterwards, Maya drowns and Anand's life is completely shattered. He becomes traumatized, blaming himself for Maya's death.  After finding out, she feels guilty for her treatment towards Anand and apologizes to him. They become good friends, spend time together, and she and Sunil work together to cure Anand and make him remember his past. This works, and Anand completely gets over the trauma of Maya's death and is finally cured. He decides to leave the asylum but stays when Tanvi expresses her love to him. He reciprocates her love and the two are happy with each other. But fate plays a part in the story, Tanvi has already fallen in love with Anand, but is engaged to Karan ([[Sunil Shetty]]), under her father, Dr Khurana's approval.  When Dr. Khurana finds out about her and Anand, he is livid as he sees this as a doctor-patient relationship, not a genuine relationship from a father's point of view. He demands Tanvi to leave him but she refuses to back down. When Karan finds out, he tells Tanvi to go with Anand. Sunil tries to make Dr. Khurana see that mental asylum patients should be treated with love, care and affection, but Khurana stubbornly believes that patients should be treated with oppression and brutality. Anand rebels against the strict hospital regime and Khurana's disapproval of Tanvi and Anand, but he refuses to back down. This makes Anand explode into a violent rage against Dr. Khurana, which results in Khurana [[lobotomy|lobotomizing]] him. Seeing no way out, Sunil and Tanvi arrive at the asylum to smuggle Anand out so that he and Tanvi can run away together, but it is too late when Sunil finds out about Anand's lobotomy. Realizing he is better off dead, Sunil sorrowfully kills his neurologically-disabled friend by suffocating him with a pillow. After Sunil confesses to Khurana about the act of euthanasia, Tanvi becomes insane due to the shock of Anand's death. She is admitted as a patient in the same asylum and the same number Anand had, no. 36. Dr. Khurana is shown to be feeling guilty of losing his own daughter to a patient in the same asylum.  
The Land Before Time XI: Invasion of the Tinysauruses
 Every year, as the warm season approaches, a certain tree in Great Valley blooms with pink flowers. Because of the tastiness of these "treesweets", every dinosaur in the valley wants his/her fair share of it. However, because of this tastiness (and the fact that there seems to be only one such tree in the whole valley), there is hardly enough for everyone. Because of this, none may eat any of the treesweets until the day they "reach the peak of their tastiness".  [[Littlefoot]] and his friends [[Ducky (The Land Before Time)|Ducky]], [[Petrie (The Land Before Time)|Petrie]] and [[Spike (The Land Before Time)|Spike]] are eagerly waiting to nibble the first treesweets. Ducky is about to take one, but [[Littlefoot]] quickly tells her to stop and reminds them all that none may take any treesweets until "Nibbling Day". This however, doesn't stop Petrie from flying to the tree's crown and trying to take one. Just then, [[Cera (The Land Before Time)|Cera]]'s father emerges and states very clearly how every dinosaur in the valley has waited a long time to taste the treesweets. As Cera, too, appears before them, she reminds them that she is the one who is supposed to get the first treesweet because she was the one who found the treesweet-tree in the first place, although it was indeed Littlefoot who did it. Cera also teases Littlefoot for being too little to actually reach the treesweets.  Meanwhile, Cera's father is visited by an old friendâa female threehorn named Tria â whom, it seems, he used to have a crush on. She also reveals his name to be Topsy (although it may simply be a nickname). After speaking a while with her, he promises Tria that she will get the first treesweet of the season; which Cera, who appears just in time to hear him say this, becomes very upset about. From that moment on, Cera refuses to make friends with Tria and simply shrugs her off whenever she tries to talk to her. In addition, Cera will turn violent towards her friends should they make any references involving Tria (be it Tria herself or Cera's father's nickname).  Littlefoot, meanwhile, goes off by himself, feeling very down about how "little" he is. As he returns to the treesweet tree, he climbs up the cliff right next to it and tries to reach the treesweets by himself. As he does, he accidentally falls right through the tree and knocks down every single treesweet. Realizing the trouble he is now in, he faints. As he wakes up, he finds himself surrounded by several miniature longnecks. They have eaten all the treesweets and quickly run away once the shocked Littlefoot starts screaming out of fear.  Upon noticing that every treesweet is gone, all the dinosaurs in the valley are standing in front of the tree; many of them, including Topsy, suspecting Littlefoot to be the guilty party. Littlefoot, afraid to admit it was his fault that the treesweets fell off the tree, blames everything on the tiny longnecks. At first, no one believes him, but when they see evidence of tiny teeth marks on a tree sweet, he is believed and everyone starts looking for the tiny longnecks, preparing to drive them out of the valley once they have been found. As Littlefoot and Cera are searching the valley, Littlefoot falls down a pothole in the ground where, it turns out, the tiny longnecks are hiding in. First being afraid of them, Littlefoot flees deeper into the cave; but soon enough, he finds out that the tiny longnecks are not as bad as he thought and befriends them. Upon hearing how difficult it is for the tinysauruses to find food, he promises to help bring them as many treestars as he can every night.  Eventually, Littlefoot feels ready to tell his friends about the colony of tiny longnecks living in the underground caverns. They all get to see the tiny longnecks for themselves, and promises not to tell the adults. Even Cera, who is still angry with her father, promises to keep it secret, mainly because she finds out that she can relate more to them than she would've imagined. Many of the tinysauruses in the colony feel that their leader, Big Daddy, bosses them around a bit too much, though he simply wants their best. As to the reason that he doesn't trust the "bigger" dinosaurs is that they, in his opinion, only seem to think: "Because they're bigger, it makes them more important".  When sneaking off to see the tinysauruses again, Littlefoot and his friends are busted by Topsy. But when he tries to ask them where they're going this time of night, Cera angrily throws the question back at him. Topsy, not wanting Cera to find out about him and Tria, manages to see them off. Just as Tria comes up to him, they spot one of the tiny longnecks. A chase ensues which eventually reveals their hideout. As the grown-ups prepare to block the caverns; Littlefoot, realizing that he must tell the truth, admits that it was his fault that the treesweets are gone, and not the tiny longnecks'. However, just as he's finished, the tinysauruses' cavern collapses, trapping the tinysauruses inside. The tinysauruses escape. The tinysauruses run into two ''[[Utahraptor]]'' that chase them and find their way into Great Valley. Meanwhile, Littlefoot's friends are mad at him. They later try to apologize to him for being angry. However, they mistake the Sharpteeth for Littlefoot. The two carnivores lunge at them, causing a chase. Littlefoot shows up just at the right time and saves Ducky just as she was about to get eaten.  When all seems lost, the tinysauruses show up and fight the Sharpteeth. The grown-ups of the Valley then show up and drive the sharpteeth back into Mysterious Beyond through a hole. Then they cover up the hole with a large boulder. Nibbling Day finally comes at last.

Kyun Tum Say Itna Pyar Hai
 The film starts as a clash between good and evil, a landscape that marks cinema across the world. The pursuits are represented in the film by two individuals who are deeply committed to their way of life. The characters are brilliantly rendered by versatile artists [[Nadeem Baig (actor)|Nadeem]] and [[Talat Hussain (actor)|Talat Hussain]], with quiet assertiveness by the former and boisterousness and exuberance by the latter.  The families of the two, a former judge ([[Nadeem Baig (actor)|Nadeem]]) and ex-chief minister ([[Talat Hussain (actor)|Talat Hussain]]) are interlinked by nuptials, but do not serve as bonds. Talat is a power-hungry politician who stops at nothing â bribery, killings, abductions â to achieve his goals. He is under investigation and the man in charge of the case is Nadeemâs character, the traditional upstanding citizen and an upholder of values and justice.  The only blemish in [[Nadeem Baig (actor)|Nadeem]]âs life is two wives, one being [[Ajab Gul]]âs mother with whom he has a strained relationship. Police officer Babrak Shah by the other wife is acknowledged as his son and so the stepbrothers have a strong dislike for each other. They also share the love of the same girl (Talatâs daughter played by [[Veena Malik]]) whose marriage to Babrak deepens the enmity and a sense of deprivation in Gul.  The first half comprises well-knit, absorbing sequences that keep viewers on the edge of their seats, not only because of twists and turns in the narrative but also by forceful portrayals of characters by the two veteran actors. [[Talat Hussain (actor)|Talat Hussain]] adds another laurel to his credentials by effectively casting off the image of being a single dimension artist with pragmatically delivered ruthless villainy.  In a manner of speaking, the two consummate artists make a negative contribution to the film because other than Gul, most players look wanting in comparison. The saving grace in the acting department is the bit roles by some known television and film actors such as [[Tahira Wasti]] and Nighat Chaudhry. Gul makes a tremendous and successful effort to match their histrionic talent but it is [[Babrak Shah]], good looking with the right build to play the lead in our films, who has an extremely difficult time. Gul could also have done better by eschewing the Khal Nayak image and at times, gestures.  The second-half of the film is almost pure action, fast-moving and lethal, but in the absence of major progression in the narrative, some footage tends to drag. Fortunately, the director, also the writer, tightens his hold in the end with a highly dramatic climax.  The action and chase sequences have been expertly handled by cinematographer [[Waqar Bokhari]], but could have been more slickly edited. The music has been composed by the writer, director and actor and one wishes he had hired a professional. The dances are well choreographed, but Sana who makes a special appearance could have been given a more sensational wardrobe for her number. Kyun Tum Se Itna Pyar Hai, however, is an action movie, a thriller extraordinary with which conventional entertainment does not gel well.  
Kyan Sit Min
 The film follows a story of King [[Kyansittha]] of [[Bagan Dynasty]].  
The Lady from Sockholm
 During Wool War II, New Jersey private investigator Terrence M. Cotton is hired to find a missing husband.  When Cotton finds the man dead, he is drawn further into a conspiracy that takes him to Chinatown and its criminal elements.  
Land of the Dead
 Years after a [[zombie apocalypse]], survivors have set up outposts across the United States. One outpost in the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, contains a [[feudal]]-like government. Bordered on two sides by rivers and on the third by an electric fence, the city has become a sanctuary. The rich and powerful live in a luxury high-rise called ''[[Fiddler's Green]]'', while the rest of the population subsists in squalor. Paul Kaufman ([[Dennis Hopper]]), the city's ruthless ruler, has sponsored ''Dead Reckoning'', an armored personnel vehicle that can travel through the zombie-infested areas with ease.  Riley Denbo ([[Simon Baker]]) is the designer and commander of ''Dead Reckoning''. Unlike Kaufman, Riley is respected for his work in protecting the citizens, as well as providing them with food and medical supplies that the citizens can no longer safely acquire themselves. Using ''Dead Reckoning'', Riley and his crew venture into areas overrun with zombies to scavenge for supplies. On one mission, they notice many zombies exhibiting intelligent behavior. One such zombie is "Big Daddy" ([[Eugene Clark (actor)|Eugene Clark]]), formerly a gas station owner. During the mission, rookie Mike ([[Shawn Roberts]]) is bitten by a zombie and commits suicide before he turns.  After the mission, Riley retires from commanding ''Dead Reckoning''. Back in the city, he visits Chihuahua's ([[Phil Fondacaro]]) bar. There, he sees a hooker named Slack ([[Asia Argento]]) being [[bear-baiting|forced into a cage]] with some zombies to entertain guests. Riley and Charlie ([[Robert Joy]]) save Slack; Charlie kills Chihuahua in the ensuing chaos. Riley, Charlie and Slack are arrested. Slack reveals that Kaufman ordered her execution, for helping Mulligan ([[Bruce McFee]]) to instigate rebellion among the poor.  Meanwhile, Cholo DeMora ([[John Leguizamo]]), ''Dead Reckoning''s second in command, is denied an apartment in Fiddler's Green despite his service to Kaufman. In retaliation, Cholo takes over ''Dead Reckoning'' and threatens to destroy Fiddler's Green with it. Kaufman approaches Riley and tasks him, as well as Charlie and Slack, to retrieve ''Dead Reckoning''. They are supervised by Manolete ([[Sasha Roiz]]), Motown (Krista Bridges), and Pillsbury ([[Pedro Miguel Arce]]).  On the way, Manolete is bitten and then killed by Slack. After catching up with ''Dead Reckoning'', Riley approaches the vehicle alone. Charlie, Slack, and Pillsbury follow him after subduing Motown and leaving her behind. Realizing Riley is working for Kaufman, Cholo holds both Riley and Charlie at gunpoint. As he prepares to fire ''Dead Reckoning''s missiles at Fiddler's Green, Riley uses a small device and deactivates ''Dead Reckoning''s weapons systems; he then destroys the device. Motown, who had regained consciousness, opens fire and nearly kills both Riley and Cholo (who is maimed by one of the gunshots). She is bitten by a zombie and killed by Slack. Riley convinces Cholo to allow him escape North and to join him, but the latter decides to return to Fiddler's Green to deal with Kaufman; his partner, Foxy ([[Tony Nappo]]) accompanies him. While en route, Cholo is bitten by a zombie and leaves to kill Kaufman by himself. Riley takes over ''Dead Reckoning'' once again and returns to Fiddler's Green.  Elsewhere, Big Daddy (who has gathered a large group of zombies) learns that they can walk safely underwater, and leads the zombies to cross the river to the human city. They take the guards by surprise and begin massacring the people. As a result of the zombies making it into the city, the electric fences that once kept the zombies out have now become a wall to trap them and the humans inside. Seeing the city overrun, Kaufman runs with his money, and encounters a zombie Cholo in the parking garage. As the two struggle, Big Daddy kills both with a propane tank.  Riley's group arrives at the city only to come upon a raised [[drawbridge]]. Riley leaves to bring the bridge down, but a small group of zombies begin to attack ''Dead Reckoning''. Riley and the others manage to dispose of and evade the zombies. After crossing the bridge, they helplessly witness people being killed by the zombies, and realizing it is too late to save them, they mercy kill them with missiles. It is then revealed that most of the poor people were led to safety by Mulligan, thus surviving the assault. Riley and Mulligan share a well-meaning goodbye as they split up with their groups. As they see Big Daddy and the zombies (who are, curiously, not attacking the surviving humans) leaving the city, Riley decides to leave them alone, citing that they are just looking for a place to go, too. While lighting up the rest of the fireworks (which were earlier used to distract the zombies but are now useless since they do not distract the horde anymore), Riley's group set off for Canada on ''Dead Reckoning''.

The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse
 One night, Jeremy Dyson calls the other members of The League of Gentlemen to talk about a new series idea he's had, in which everyone in Royston Vasey would wake up with a tail, but the other writers no longer wish to write the series and are keen to move on to new projects. Suddenly he is confronted by three characters from the series; Papa Lazarou and the Tattsyrups. Dyson tries to run, but falls off the edge of a cliff.  At the church in Royston Vasey, the local vicar, Bearnice Woodall, tells fellow residents Pauline Campbell-Jones and Mr. Chinnery that there are signs of [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|The Apocalypse]] occurring.  Hilary Briss has escaped from prison and is on the moors near Royston Vasey. He finds Herr Lipp there and holds him hostage. Briss uses Lipp to steal a car, driven by Geoff Tipps. Fleeing fireballs, Briss leads them through a door in the church crypt, and they emerge In  the real town of  [[Hadfield, Derbyshire]], the setting for Royston Vasey in ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'' television series.  With the situation explained to them by Lazarou and the Tattsyrups,  Briss, Herr Lipp and Geoff Tipps travel to [[London]]. Lipp pretends to be his creator, Steve Pemberton, and goes home, where he discovers that Pemberton has been neglecting his family.  Briss and Tipps read through The League of Gentlemen's new project, a historical horror called ''The King's Evil''. While Tipps continues to read, Briss chases after an escapee Pemberton and re-captures him, but when they return to the hideout, Briss discovers that Tipps has written himself into the plot of ''The King's Evil'' as the hero.  Lipp meanwhile has become deeply attached to Pemberton's family, in particular his children. He looks through some of Pemberton's personal belongings in order to find Pemberton's notes.  Briss takes Pemberton up to Hadfield, where Pemberton telephones Reece Shearsmith to tell him what has been going on. Shearsmith does not believe that Pemberton has been captured and thinks that Briss is playing a joke on him, so Briss comes to the phone. Shearsmith initially believes that Mark Gatiss is joining in on the "joke" when he opens a door and Gatiss is standing right in front of him. Shearsmith and Gatiss find and capture Herr Lipp, and they travel up to Hadfield.  They enter the dimensional door, go back to Royston Vasey, and swap their hostages, but Pemberton is killed by a stray gunshot. Dr Erasmus Pea, the villain of ''The King's Evil'', tries to convince Briss to leave Royston Vasey and join him, but Briss refuses. Pea kills his fellow characters and turns them into a gigantic homunculus, which Briss fights. Shearsmith and Gatiss climb up the wall of the church in order to escape, but Shearsmith falls to his death.  Briss kills the monster, but he himself is stabbed in the back by Pea. Before he dies, he tells Tipps that he is the only one who can save Royston Vasey. Tipps fights with Dr. Pea, while Gatiss tries to return to the modern world. However, he is stopped by Herr Lipp, who holds him at gunpoint. Tipps manages to kill Pea using part of the homunculus, but the chaos still goes on. In the church, Lipp says he will kill Gatiss. The other characters try to dissuade him, as they believe that once all the writers are dead, Royston Vasey will cease to exist and all of them will die. Lipp claims that they will in fact be better off, because as long as they're being controlled by someone else they have no free will and can never change for the better. Tipps tells Lipp that because he managed to save the day and can therefore change, Lipp does not need to kill Gatiss. He persuades Herr Lipp to hand him the gun, only for Tipps to accidentally fire it and kill Gatiss himself.  With all the writers now dead, the residents of Royston Vasey prepare for the worst, but instead, everything calms down and The Apocalypse ends. The characters realise they now have free will. Herr Lipp adopts some orphaned children, the vet, Mr Chinnery, finds a rabbit and is able to take care of it without killing it, and Bearnice and Pauline appear to become romantically involved. Tipps leaves the church, waving goodbye to Edward, Tubbs and Papa Lazarou. It appears that Royston Vasey can continue to exist independently of its dead creators.  However, Dyson is still alive and in a coma after falling off the cliff. Everyone else in the world now has tails.  
The Legend of Zorro
 In 1851, nine years after the events of [[The Mask of Zorro|the first film]], California is voting on whether to join the [[United States of America]] as a state. Alejandro Murrieta, as Zorro, foils a plot to steal the ballots, but during the fight with a gunman named Jacob McGivens, he briefly loses his mask. A pair of [[Pinkertons|Pinkerton agents]] sees his face and recognize him. The following day, the Pinkertons confront Alejandro's wife Elena and force her to divorce him.  Three months later, the separation from Elena and his son Joaquin, and the feeling that the people no longer need Zorro, are taking its toll on Alejandro. His childhood guardian, Father Felipe, convinces him to attend a party at French Count Armand's new vineyard. There, Alejandro discovers that Elena is dating the count. After leaving the party, Alejandro witnesses a huge explosion close to Armand's mansion and becomes suspicious of him.   McGivens leads an attack on the family of Guillermo Cortez, Alejandro's friend, to seize their land deed. Donning his mask again, Zorro rescues Guillermo's wife and son, but fails to save Guillermo and the deed. Zorro follows McGivens to Armand's mansion and discovers that Armand plans to build a railroad on Cortez's land. He also encounters Elena, and learning of an upcoming shipment, he tracks McGivens to a [[cove]] where the cargo is delivered. Unbeknownst to him, Joaquin also hitched a ride on McGiven's cart, having sneaked out of a class trip. Zorro saves his son from the bandits, and examing the shipment, he sees a piece of the cargo, a bar of soap, and the name ''Orbis Unum'' on a crate lid. Upon researching the phrase, Felipe and Alejandro learn that Armand is the head of a secret society, the Knights of Aragon, which has been secretly ruling Europe. The United States is deemed a threat to the Knights, so they plan to throw the country into chaos before it can gain too much power.   Alejandro is captured by the Pinkertons, who reveal that they forced Elena to divorce Alejandro in order to get close to Armand and learn of his plans without the aid of Zorro, as they dislike Zorro and his vigilante ways. Joaquin frees Alejandro from captivity. Zorro goes to Armand's mansion, meets Elena, and eavesdrops on Armand's meeting. He learns that the [[Glycerin soap|soap bars]] are secretly used as [[Glycerol#Explosive|an ingredient]] for [[nitroglycerin]], which Armand plans to distribute throughout the [[Confederate Army]], with the help of Confederate Colonel Beauregard, to destroy the Union. Zorro and Elena reconcile, and Zorro prepares to destroy the train carrying the explosives. McGivens arrives at Felipe's church to look for Zorro. Unable to find him, McGivens shoots the priest and kidnaps Joaquin.  At the mansion, Armand is informed by his butler, [[Ferroq]], about Elena's deception. He confronts her, also revealing he had killed the Pinkertons, and takes her and Joaquin hostage on the train carrying the explosives, making Zorro unable to destroy it. Zorro is captured and unmasked in front of his son. Armand takes Joaquin and Elena away and orders McGivens to kill Alejandro. Felipe, having been saved from McGivens's bullet by a cross he wears, arrives, and he and Alejandro overpower and kill McGivens.   Zorro catches up with Armand, and they engage in a sword fight. Meanwhile, Elena has Joaquin escape into the back cars of the train, which she disconnects. Elena fights Ferroq in the nitro storage car and throws him and a bottle of nitro out of the car and at the feet of Colonel Beauregard at their prearranged meeting point, killing them. Further along the tracks, the governor prepares to sign the bill to make California a Union state. Joaquin collects Tornado, Zorro's horse, jumps off the train, and overtakes it. He hits a track switch, causing the train to harmlessly pass around the ceremony. Zorro and Armand's duel takes them to the very front of the locomotive. Seeing the track is a dead end, Zorro hooks Armand to the train and escapes with Elena. The train crashes into the pile of rails at the end of the track, setting off the nitroglycerin, killing Armand.  With Zorro as an official witness, the governor signs the bill, and California becomes the 31st state of the United States of America. Felipe remarries Alejandro and Elena, and Alejandro apologizes to his son for hiding his identity, admitting that Zorro's identity is a family secret rather than just his own. With Elena's support, Zorro rides off on Tornado to his next mission.  
Last Order: Final Fantasy VII
 Narrated by Tseng, leader of the elite espionage and assassination division known as the Turks, ''Last Order'' switches between the Nibelheim incident and Zack Fair's escape to Midgar with his unconscious friend, Cloud Strife. During the Nibelheim event, Sephiroth, insane after discovering his origins, sets fire to the village of Nibelheim. After killing many villagers, he proceeds to the Nibelheim reactor where Jenova has been encased. Tifa, a resident of Nibelheim, attacks him soon after he arrives. Sephiroth knocks her aside and continues to Jenova's body, preserved in a large glass tank filled with liquid. Zack follows Sephiroth into the reactor and they engage in combat, but Sephiroth is able to disarm and incapacitate him. Sephiroth returns to Jenova's body, but does not notice Cloud approaching. [[Image:Last Order screenshot.jpg|left|175px|thumb|Cloud is impaled by Sephiroth and hung over the reactor core, a scene also explored in other ''Final Fantasy VII'' series' titles<ref name="change"/><ref></ref><ref></ref>]]  Cloud immediately impales Sephiroth with his sword, cracking Jenova's glass tank. He returns to Tifa and the two converse, while Sephiroth cuts off Jenova's head. He carries the head with him towards Cloud and they engage in battle. During the fight, Cloud is impaled through the stomach and hung over the reactor's core. In a feat of strength, he grabs Sephiroth's sword and moves himself down the blade to solid ground and hurls Sephiroth aside. Sephiroth abandons the battle and jumps into the reactor core with Jenova's head in an attempt to reach the "Promised Land". Although Zack and Cloud survive the ordeal, they are taken to the Shinra Mansion by Hojo for experimentation.  The other event detailed in ''Last Order'' illustrates Zack and Cloud's escape from Shinra. While at the Shinra Mansion, Cloud had succumbed to Mako poisoning caused by a surge of memories flooding through his mind,<ref name="doctor">'''Doctor:''' "I'll say it again, he's got Mako poisoning.

However, Shinra orders their paramilitary and the Turks to find and eliminate the two escapees. Tseng decides to capture them alive.  On a bluff overlooking Zack and Cloud, who had hitched a ride on a truck, Shinra operatives decide to ignore orders to wait for the Turks. One takes aim at the incapacitated Cloud. Zack jumps in front of Cloud, yelling at him to escape.  
Left Behind: World at War
 Eighteen months after the events of the previous film, the world has fallen into chaos. In the collapsing ruins of the [[White House]], [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] Gerald Fitzhugh ([[Louis Gossett Jr.]]) videotapes a confession. He looks out the window as a shadowy figure arrives in the doorway.  One week earlier, the Tribulation Force, consisting of [[Rayford Steele]] ([[Brad Johnson (actor, born 1959)|Brad Johnson]]), his daughter [[Chloe Steele|Chloe]] ([[Janaya Stephens]]), [[Buck Williams]] ([[Kirk Cameron]]), [[Bruce Barnes (Left Behind)|Bruce Barnes]] ([[Arnold Pinnock]]), and Chris Smith are in the process of stealing Bibles from a Global Community (GC) compound. Guards burst into the warehouse and kill Chris while the remaining Trib Force members escape. In [[Washington, D.C.]], the President and his [[Vice President of the United States|Vice-President]], John Mallory ([[Charles Martin Smith]]), are taking some time away from the White House. Mallory informs Fitzhugh of Nicolae's plans and how he has found evidence that Nicolae is planning a [[Biological warfare|biological attack]] on American soil. Before he can share the information, Mallory is killed in an ambush, but a militia group comes to the aid of the President.  Back at the Trib Force underground headquarters, Bruce Barnes performs a double wedding ceremony: Buck to Chloe, and Rayford to [[Amanda White (Left Behind)|Amanda White]], the newest member who once knew Rayford's first wife before the vanishings. After the ceremony is over, Buck heads over to [[Los Angeles]] and Rayford flies to New Babylon. Nicolae meets with Fitzhugh who expresses his deepest concern over the news of Mallory's death, and teams up with Carolyn Miller, who poses as Nicolae's top aide at GC headquarters. Together, they find Nicolae's secret plan of stealing Bibles and lacing them with anthrax before distributing them. The GC block their escape, and Fitzhugh kills one of the guards in the process.  Fitzhugh is recruited by Miller's ragtag military team to help take out Nicolae, which he participates in. As Fitzhugh enters the GC building and asks to see the President (it is also revealed that one of the GC guards is really an insider, but is shot by another). Fitzhugh enters Nicolae's office, but Nicolae is already aware of Fitzhugh's assassination attempt and foils it. Fitzhugh tries to shoot Nicolae with three rounds, but he isn't affected as they go through him and hit a guard instead. Using supernatural techniques, Nicolae throws Fitzhugh out of a 20-story window, landing on top of a car. Nicolae goes over to the window to see, in disgust, Fitzhugh getting up and walking away. Fitzhugh is not believed when he returns to the militia base to inform that the plan failed: Carolyn takes this the hardest.  The underground Trib Force HQ is hit the hardest as [[World War III]] approaches. Bruce and Chloe are infected with the virulent bacteria, but in the end it is Chloe who miraculously survives when red wine, used in the communion they just took part of, is revealed to be the antidote. Buck meets Fitzhugh in a destroyed White House, where he helps the President become a Christian. Fitzhugh then confronts Nicolae in a final showdown where he activates a personal transmitter (and dials Carolyn's cell phone, where she hears the entire conversation), hoping to obliterate the entire GC headquarters, and himself, with a missile locked onto the transmitter's location. Fitzhugh dies in the resulting explosion, wiping out the GC base.  Buck Williams gets a call in the elevator from Chloe as she tells him about the wine and Bruce's death. Buck promises to come home from his trip soon as the elevator stops and the door opens to reveal an armed Carolyn. She lowers her weapon and Buck states that they need to talk, implying that they had met before. What is left of the Global Community Building burns down, police sirens wail in the background, and explosions are still going on. Nicolae Carpathia walks out from the flames looking very mad, completely unharmed.  
The Legend of Frosty the Snowman
 At the beginning of the story, we see Frostyâs hat escape from a locked chest in an attic, fly out a window, and descend on the picture perfect town of Evergreen, where all the local children are bound to a ridiculously strict curfew and not allowed to have any kind of fun whatsoever. Frosty first reveals himself to Tommy Tinkerton (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]), the son of the townâs impossibly upbeat but no-nonsense mayor, Mr. Tinkerton (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]). Tommy dares not to accept Frostyâs invitation to play outside in the snow, because heâs afraid of disappointing his father. So Frosty instead befriends Tommyâs best friend, Walter Wader, who shocks everyone, especially his very strict mother, by breaking curfew and flying, sledding, and snowball-fighting with Frosty.  Walterâs rule-breaking gets all the kids of Evergreen talking, but it greatly upsets Principal Pankley (voiced by [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]]), who is even more adamantly opposed to magic than Mr. Tinkerton. Principal Pankley uses the arrival of Frosty to sow doubts among the townspeople about Mayor Tinkertonâs leadership, and little by little he begins to take over the town.  But once magic is stirred up, it isnât easily contained. One by one, Frosty wins over the other kids of Evergreen, including Tommy's older brother, Charles, Tommy's love interest, Sara Simple (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) (a sharp, independent girl who wants to be an urban planner instead of a "princess"); and the triplets, Sonny, Sully, and Simon Sklarew. Frosty befriends each of them through the simple means of believing in them, which inspires them to begin to believe in themselves.  Increasingly desperate to deny the existence of Frosty and keep Evergreen fun-free, Principal Pankley tricks Walter Wader into helping him lure Frosty for some ice-skating fun, then tricks Frosty into venturing onto thin ice. Before Walter can save his friend, Frosty falls through the ice and melts, and Principal Pankley captures Frostyâs hat, which is the key to his magic.  As all of this unfolds, Tommy Tinkerton, who was the first one to whom Frosty appeared, has been sitting on the sidelines, watching his best friend, his brother, and his love interest experiencing adventure and magic in which he could share. But he has held back, even though he yearns to meet Frosty, out of loyalty to his dad (because he knows his dad would disapprove of him acknowledging the existence of magic).  Everything changes, though, when Tommy finds a secret room beneath the library, in which he discovers a comic book filled with secrets about Frosty. At first, most of the comic book is blank. Each time Tommy checks it again, new panels appear. Over the course of several scenes, Tommy learns that Frostyâs magic is in his hat; that his dad (Mr. Tinkerton) met Frosty when he was a boy, and did believe in magic once upon a time; and that Principal Pankley, a childhood friend of his fatherâs, took Frostyâs hat and hid it away in an attic (the same attic from which the hat escaped at the beginning of the story), causing young Mr. Tinkerton to lose his faith in magic. The comic book also reveals to Tommy what Principal Pankley has just done (with Walter Waderâs unwitting help) to recapture Frosty.  All this time, Tommy has held back from befriending Frosty out of loyalty to his dad, who has always told Tommy not to believe in magic.  But now Tommy sees that his dad once believed in magic, too, but was tricked into losing faith. And Tommy realizes that the most loyal thing he can do is not to hide from magic, but to help his dad rediscover that magic is indeed real.  Tommy explains whatâs really going on to Charlie, Sara, Walter, and the Sklarew triplets, and leads a daring rescue of Frostyâs hat in which all the kids help out. A climactic series of scenes follows in which Principal Pankley tries and fails to recapture the hat, then tries to deter the townspeople (including Mr. Tinkerton) from going into the woods to see what all the ruckus and noise are about. But Mr. Tinkerton refuses to be deterred, and Tommy is able to reintroduce his dad to the old friend, who Mr. Tinkerton had long since stopped believing in.  Meanwhile, the other parents are confused and angry: why are their kids out at night? And can this magical snowman theyâve been hearing about be real after all? Principal Pankley tries to stir them up to regain control of the situation, but Walter Wader breaks the spell by throwing a snowball at Principal Pankley. And one by one, the other kids and parents join in, until the town of Evergreen, which had forgotten how to have fun, gives itself over joyously to a âsnowball-fighting, horseplaying, lark of a good time.â  A brief epilogue shows us Evergreen transformedâwith Mr. Tinkerton doing magic tricks, Charles playing football, Tommy skateboarding, and Sara reading a book about urban planning.  All along, the story has been narrated (Ã  la â[[Our Town]]â) by a warm, wise, seemingly omniscient old man who appears periodically and comments on the events unfolding in Evergreen. In the final scene of the movie,it is revealed that the narrator is Tommy, all grown up and now married to Sara; and he has been telling us his own story.

In response, Richard asks Alain if he and Alice had sex, which Alain denies. That evening, Alain calls BÃ©nÃ©dicte, who initially doesn't answer, then abuses him. Concerned, Alain decides to drive home immediately, although it is late and he is tired. He finds BÃ©nÃ©dicte sleeping and is unable to wake her. He hears noises coming from the kitchen, discovers it is full of lemmings, and faints. Alain wakes up in a hospital; he crashed after falling asleep at the wheel, and the previous nights events were apparently a dream.  Upon Alain's release from hospital, he and BÃ©nÃ©dicte visit Richard's lakeside holiday chalet. BÃ©nÃ©dicte continues to behave coldly. She asks why Alain hadn't told her about Alice's attempt to seduce him, using the exact words Alice used that night, and asks Alain to call her "Alice". They have sex and Alain falls asleep. When he wakes, BÃ©nÃ©dicte and their car are gone. Alain hitches a ride home, and discovers that BÃ©nÃ©dicte started an affair with Richard while he was in hospital and is about to move into his house. Alain uses his drone to observe Richard's house,  and finds BÃ©nÃ©dicte as expected. As Richard and BÃ©nÃ©dicte are about to have sex, the camera fails. It appears that Alice has taken control of BÃ©nÃ©dicte and resumed her life with Richard inside BÃ©nÃ©dicte's body. Meanwhile, the vet returns the lemming to Alain's house. The lemming bites Alain and disappears in the house.   The next day, Richard confronts Alain at work with pieces of the drone he found in the garden. That evening, "Alice-BÃ©nÃ©dicte" visits Alain to offer him a deal: If he kills Richard, he would get BÃ©nÃ©dicte back. She gives Alain the key to Richard's house and leaves. That night Alain goes to Richard's house. He finds Richard and "Alice-BÃ©nÃ©dicte" asleep in the bedroom, and smothers Richard with a pillow while "Alice-BÃ©nÃ©dicte" watches. Alain carries Richard's body to the kitchen, where he operates the coffee-machine and the gas stove. "Alice-BÃ©nÃ©dicte" follows him to the car in a trance-like state. Back at their house, "Alice-BÃ©nÃ©dicte" goes straight to bed. When she wakes up, she is BÃ©nÃ©dicte againâshe says she dreamt of Alice, but doesn't remember any of the recent events.  The next day, the couple are in their garden when they receive news of Richard's apparent suicide by causing a gas explosion in his house. BÃ©nÃ©dicte innocently asks Alain if he believes Richard committed suicide because of Alice's death. She then discovers the dead lemming and throws it away. The mystery of its origin is resolved by Alain in a voice over: Their neighbours' son had brought the animal from a family holiday to Finland; his upset father then flushed it down the toilet. Finally, Alain mentions that BÃ©nÃ©dicte is pregnant.  
Lie with Me
 The camera slowly zooms out on a young woman [[masturbating]] to a [[porn]] sex tape. She gets up abruptly and goes out to a party, looking for sex. Leila has learned she has some power over men with sex but feels a part of her is still untouched, holding back, despite her assertiveness. Before she can choose a partner for the night she is corraled by David, into a bathroom, while his girlfriend calls through the door. She leaves, but keeps her eye on David as she picks up a shy guy, with whom she has sex against a fence outside as David watches from his car while his girlfriend [[fellates]] him. Leila is in complete control of her encounter while David remains completely passive.  He next sees her walking down the street, and follows her. She smiles but does not speak to him and breaks into a run, leading him to a playground. They crouch inside a small tunnel and watch each other as she begins to touch herself. But this time he leaves.  Leila visits her parents and learns that her mother is leaving her father and selling her childhood home. Her father is devastated, staying [[Substance intoxication|stoned]] on [[Cannabis (drug)|pot]] and refusing to do anything while her mother clears out the house. Leila's best friend, Victoria, is getting ready to be married, but confesses that she's had sex with an old boyfriend recently, despite her insistence that she loves her fiance and is ready to settle down. Leila is skeptical but supportive, and Victoria laughs when she turns on the [[VCR]] and discovers the porn tape Leila was watching; Leila tells her nothing about David.  When Leila sees David again they finally speak to each other, and he takes her home, where they have sex. He asks Leila if she will go out with him on a real date, giving her his number when she leaves.  They finally do go out, and begin a real romance. She meets his father, who is physically fragile but very funny, teasing her about having sex and making noise in their apartment. David cares very tenderly for the old man, who is charmingly brusque. Leila is still skittish, although she is not intimidated when David's old girlfriend confronts her at her job, warning her that David has intimacy issues. When they go back to the club again, Leila dances suggestively with a couple of men while watching David's reaction, and he is hurt and angry when they return to his place. She brushes off his fears when he confesses that he thinks of nothing but her, that he needs her, but she acts like it's all a game. He begs to her to promise that she won't leave him, and she does, but doesn't believe it herself.  When David finds his father dead, he turns to Leila for consolation, but she doesn't know how to comfort him. This leads to conflict, and ends with him asking her to leave.  Later, he reconsiders; but he is unable to find Leila again, as he knows nothing about her except her first name. Leila finds her sexual world more and more unsatisfying and becomes increasingly frustrated. She picks up the shy guy again, but strikes at him in anger when he is unable to follow her peremptory commands, and throws him out of her apartment in disgust.  Leila spends time with her parents as they go their separate ways, and gets ready for the wedding while the summer is coming to an end. As she rides her bicycle to the ceremony David sees her and follows in his truck. He waits outside the [[synagogue]] and approaches her as everyone floods out onto the sidewalk following the wedding, and then Victoria grabs Leila's hand and she calls out to David, to ask if he's coming. At the reception David watches Leila dance with an old man, but she runs away again when he approaches her. This time he follows her all the way home, and all the way inside, telling her he won't leave her again. They reunite and the film ends with the two engaging in a passionate kiss.

Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch
 [[Stitch (Disney)|Stitch]] is having a nightmare about turning bad again and causing destruction to Earth, including hurting [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]. After Stitch is woken up by Lilo, she comforts him by telling him she knows he would never cause harm to her. Lilo also tests his goodness level by having him do a few good deeds. Discovering that they are late for hula class, they use their hovercraft to get there.  While at the hula class, Kumu announces that Lilo and her classmates have to prepare to perform at the local [[May Day parade|May Day festival]]. Each student is required to create an original dance. Lilo is inspired when Kumu tells her about her mother being in the festival at her age and winning, giving her a picture of the event. After the hula class ends, [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] insults Lilo by telling her that she will never be like her mother, causing her to start a fight with her. But after taking pictures of the brawl, Stitch forgets to flush the evidence. Kumu thinks that Lilo is not ready for the competition because of the fight with Mertle, but Lilo says that she is ready and "triple promises" to be good.  While preparing for the competition, Lilo and Stitch have a hard time coming up with ideas and [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Nani Pelekai|Nani]] wants them to enjoy their family fun night. While watching ''[[Them!]]'' on family fun night, Stitch's past comes back to haunt him and he goes berserk in the house. It seems that after Stitch was created, [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] did not get a chance to fully charge Stitch's molecules as he was arrested by the intergalactic police who disrupted the process. At first, this glitch causes Stitch to revert to his old destructive programming, but it will ultimately destroy him if Jumba cannot create a fusion chamber before Stitch's energy runs out for good.  Meanwhile, Stitch's uncontrollable destructive behavior drives a wedge between him and Lilo and threatens to ruin her chances for success at the hula competition. Lilo and Stitch try to be inspired for their hula, but Stitch keeps malfunctioning because of his molecules. Since Lilo is so concerned about winning the competition, she fails to notice Stitch's glitch, which is not his fault, and she believes his new behavior is deliberate and begins to neglect him.  Eventually, the two devise a hula based on the legend of [[Hi'iaka]]. Lilo gets increasingly mad at Stitch as he ruins their practice sessions. To make matters worse, Jumba is having problems creating the fusion chamber because he doesn't have the proper alien technology to build one and must resort to using mere household objects. However, just before the competition, Stitch arrives just before Lilo is to perform, wishing her luck. The two make up as Jumba finally completes the fusion chamber. However, Stitch has another abrupt fit. Lilo, confused, tries to come up to him, causing Stitch to accidentally scratch her face. After this, Stitch becomes greatly upset that he hurt her. Knowing that Stitch would never want to intentionally hurt her, Lilo finally realizes that something is wrong with him. Lilo tries to ask what's wrong, but Stitch runs off to leave Earth, believing himself to be too dangerous. In the middle of her performance, Lilo runs off to help him.  As Stitch attempts to leave Earth, Lilo and the rest of the family desperately try to get him back to re-charge him. While taking off, Stitch has another outburst, which causes him to crash the spaceship in the Hawaiian mountains. Lilo rides over to the crash site in the hovercraft from earlier where she finds Stitch close to death and hurriedly gets him into Jumba's fusion chamber. However, it's too late and Lilo watches in tears as Stitch dies.  Taking him out of the chamber, Lilo clings to him as she tells him that while she kept saying that she needed him, he needed her more. She says that he is her ''[[ohana|ohana]]'' and, therefore, will always love him and breaks down in tears. Much to everyone's shock, Stitch awakens. Pleakley is at a loss, to which Jumba explains: Stitch was revived by Lilo's love. The family (along with David) then performs Lilo's hula dance together on the empty stage of the competition. Nani tells Lilo that their mother would be proud of her and a star twinkles in the sky to prove it.

Lil' Pimp
 A little [[red hair|redhead]], [[freckle]]d 9-year-old boy (whose name is not mentioned during the movie, but is revealed in the very end of the movie, as well as in the credits, to be ''Lil' Pimp'') is unable to adapt to suburban life, as his only friend is a [[vulgarity|foul mouthed]] [[gerbil]] and faces constant rejection by his peers. He accidentally meets a [[prostitute]] under the name of Sweet Chiffon, who takes him to her working place, a bar named ''"the Playground"'', where he befriends the [[pimp]] "Fruit Juice", who gives him a small amount of "pimp glitter". He decides he wants to become a pimp.   The following day at school, during show and tell he is scorned by his classmates for not having a living male relative and decides to use the pimp glitter to summon Fruit Juice, who consequently impresses the whole class. When he visits the Playground again, Fruit Juice alters the boy's style and dresses him as a pimp, too. Meanwhile, mayor Tony Gold threatens to close Fruit Juice's bar, unless he is given 90% of the profits. After this incident the boy's mother goes in search of him, first directed to a [[gay bar]] and informed by Sweet Chiffon of a "nasty midget" closely resembling her son and then to the Playground. The boy refuses to return home to his mother, of which mayor Tony is informed directly and takes advantage, accusing Fruit Juice of keeping the boy against his will.  He is promptly arrested and his bar is closed down. Afterwards, mayor Tony Gold kidnaps Fruit Juice's prostitutes, in order to exploit them, while assigning two policemen to plant a bomb in the closed ''Playground''.   Meanwhile, Fruit Juice believes that the boy betrayed him, but upon being visited and helped to escape by the boy, he changes his attitude towards him. After the narrow escape, the boy's friends meet secretly in his room in order to concoct a plan to foil the Mayor's scheme. His mother discovers them and agrees to disguise herself as a prostitute in order to lure the two policemen into giving her the keys to the [[Town Hall]].

Then, after the gang moves the explosives, mayor Tony, unaware of the situation, presses the button on the remote controlling the bomb, devouring the Town Hall.   In the end, Fruit Juice turns his bar into a [[theme park]] also named "the Playground" but less sexually explicit. Mayor Tony and the two policemen are then shown to be working at the park as costumed mascots.

She is in need of [[money]] to become a partner in the video store that she works in, but her loan applications are repeatedly rejected by finance providers, as a result of her past criminal record, poor repayments of credit card debt, history of drug use and lack of collateral. Tracy lies to both her mother and her boss at the video store, pretending she has received the loan. This is one of the recurring themes of the movie, the casual ways people lie to each other for convenience.  Tracy is trying to help her [[Illicit drug use in Australia|drug addicted]] stepfather and former NRL star Lionel ([[Hugo Weaving]]) to kick his heroin addiction. After a four-year absence in [[Vancouver]], her former boyfriend Jonny Nguyen ([[Dustin Nguyen]]), also a former heroin addict, has come back into her life.

Tracy, Ray and Jonny set out to execute the deal, which ends in tragedy. Tracy's courage and deep love for those she cares about are notable in the climactic scenes of the film.  
A Little Trip to Heaven
 The very beginning of the film, before the opening credits, shows a new widow sitting in a life insurance office. Expecting to be compensated for her husband's death, the widow is informed that she is not entitled to full death benefits because the insurance company has captured footage of her husband smoking and attributes his death to cigarettes. Abe Holt looks on as his co-worker convinces the widow that she's lucky to leave with a small fraction of the award she was expecting.  The film centers around three vehicle crashes, which are first introduced to the viewer one after another at the very beginning of the movie. The first shows a young couple flying through the open roof of their convertible, which has been ejected over a cliff. They swim to shore, where the woman hits the leg of her fellow passenger with a pipe. The second involves a city bus and insurance adjustor Abe Holt ([[Forest Whitaker]]), who has arrived at the scene on the suspicion that many of the passengers boarded the bus after the accident, looking to file a claim. Holt bluffs, claiming a hidden camera will help sort out who was truly on the bus; many leave, and his co-worker ([[Peter Coyote]]) quickly tells him their company wants him to investigate a crash in the remote and desolate town of North Hastings, [[Minnesota]].  The third crash involves an unnamed young man who is stranded at the side of the road on a rainy night, after stopping in the local bar. He accepts a ride from the man who has drained his gas tank, who proceeds to speed the car against the wall of a tunnel, injuring his passenger in the wreck. The anonymous man is dragged to the front seat and buckled in before the gas is poured over the car and set ablaze.  However, to those who later discover the crash it appears that Kelvin Anderson has died after crashing his own car into the tunnel wall, prompting a spontaneous vehicle fire that burned his body beyond recognition. The local police are convinced it is an open-and-shut case, as Kelvinâs driver's license is found in the glovebox, the plates on the car match Kelvin's, and Kelvin's sister, Isold ([[Julia Stiles]]), lives on the other side of the tunnel.  However, Holt is suspicious because while the body is conveniently unidentifiable the license is still intact and Isold, the sole beneficiary of the $1 million policy, is skittish and was not expecting her brother's visit. Isoldâs husband, the suspiciously cheerful and vaguely threatening "Fred" McBride ([[Jeremy Renner]]), further convinces Holt there's something else to this case. As he continues to investigate the case Holt discovers a number of surprising secrets, among them the fact that Frederick McBride is actually dead (buried in a field outside the abandoned McBride home) and that the supposedly dead Kelvin has a record as a [[con man]]. The most convincing evidence are photos of Kelvin, from his criminal record and high school, showing him looking like the man posing as "Fred." Holt eventually determines that the charred body pulled from the car wreck is not Kelvin's, that Isold's "husband" is actually her brother Kelvin. A flashback reveals that the couple from the convertible seen at the opening of the movie was Isold and Kelvin, wrecking their carâand Kelvin's legâfor insurance money.  When Isold figures out that her brother has murdered an innocent drifter she is horrified, but Kelvin convinces her to "play her part" in this last con by holding hostage his son Thor, whom Isold has been helping him raise since the boy's mother left. When Isold visits the insurance office to collect on Kelvin's policy, Holtâin an echo of the movie's opening sceneâinforms her that he cannot award her the full $1 million she expects, only the blue book value of his car ($1500). Isold leaves angrily; when Holt tells her she's lucky he hasn't exposed her as an accessory to murder, she tells him that her brother has taken Thor. Moved and concerned, Holt puts a one-day hold on her check (ensuring that she'll return to the bank the next day) and changes the name of the insured on the policy from "Kelvin Anderson" to "Frederick McBride."  The next day Isold cashes her check and opens a safety deposit box, in which she puts a childhood picture of her and her brother. She returns to the motel where Kelvin is staying with Thor, and tries to convince him that she has left the rest of the money in the safety deposit box so that she can leave with Thor. Kelvin doesn't buy it, and gets in his car with Thorâonly to find he's held at gunpoint by Holt, in the backseat. Holt tells Isold to leave with the boy and Fred speeds off, buckling his seatbelt (a sign he'll crash the car). Kelvin crashes the car, killing both men, and Isold is awarded the full benefits of the tampered life insurance policy.  The film ends with Abe is walking in a beach (probably [[heaven]]) which is identical to a beach featured in the insurance company's commercial seen earlier in the film, as the credits roll.

To Gabe's elation, they begin spending time together and he is completely enamored with not only her, but her life.

As their relationship progresses, Gabe begins to question what is happening to him and why he is falling in love with Rosemary. When things seem to be going perfectly, Gabe's world is suddenly turned upside down when he and Rosemary are assigned new sparring partners. Gabe is instantly jealous of Rosemary's new partner: a taller blonde boy named Tim Staples, who's much better at self-defense than he is. With their remaining time running out, Gabe tries to move closer to Rosemary, but only drives her away. In a desperate move to win Rosemary back, Gabe attempts to show off for Rosemary to get his [[Obi (martial arts)|yellow belt]], but painfully fractures his hand in the process.  Being crushed with what love really is, he learns from his father that the parents' marriage fell apart because of things left unsaid. Realizing he is out of time, Gabe goes to find Rosemary. He interrupts her during the wedding reception she is attending and declares his love. Taken aback, Rosemary replies she doesn't think she is ready for love, but is really happy to see Gabe. She asks for a dance and Gabe agrees. As they dance, Gabe muses that he and Rosemary were on different paths â "like two ships that passed in [[Sheep Meadow, Central Park|Sheep Meadow]]". He returns home to find his parents laughing over their honeymoon recollections. Gabe is pleased and surprised when his father says he "cleared out some old stuff" and his parents appear to have reconciled. They happily go out for dinner, and as the movie ends, Gabe, narrating, summarizes what Rosemary meant to him: "...I'm never gonna get another first love. That one's always gonna be her."

Locusts: The 8th Plague
 The film starts in a genetics laboratory 15 miles outside [[Prairie]], [[Idaho]]. Inside the laboratory, Gary Wolf ([[David Keith]]) and Russ Snow ([[Jeff Fahey]]) have made a completely new species of [[locust]] that is genetically engineered to eat insects that destroy crops. In the main room in the crop dome, Russ releases the locusts into a crop field filled with insects for one minute, luring them back into the main holding pen using a strong pheromone lure. One of the main vents jams midway through the process and Gary sends one of the Silogen workers into the tunnel system. The worker finds that the vent is stuck in the open position and after scanning the holding pen, the locusts attack the worker and he is killed within a few seconds. The locusts then escape from the Silogen Research Facility through the open vent.  Meanwhile, on a small farm near Prairie, Colt Dunton ([[Dan Cortese]]) is producing a new kind of organic pesticide which he introduces to his friends, Hank Odem and his wife Agatha. Colt leaves the farm to check his pesticide and Hank starts his husker blade to harvest the corn. The blade suddenly jams, Hank gets out to investigate and discovers the remains of a bull that has been almost completely eaten. He radios Agatha and tells her about the bull. Agatha hears something in the corn and discovers the remains of her son, Mike. Grief-stricken, she starts to panic. Hank heads towards his combine and discovers that it is covered in locusts which attack and kill him. Agatha runs through the field and is also attacked and killed by the locusts. Colt arrives on the scene and finds the dead body of a locust. He runs to the medical hospital where his girlfriend, Vicky ([[Julie Benz]]), works as a veterinarian. Vicky and Colt then hear reports of cows and farm animals dying in the same way as the bull on Hank's farm. Vicky and Colt examine the remains of a dead cow and find a locust in it.  Meanwhile in Prairie, a family having a picnic is attacked by the locusts and their son is the only survivor. A State Trooper (Atanas Srebrev) takes him to a hospital. Colt examines a dead locust that was on the car that the Trooper used to bring in the child and discovers that it is a juvenile. Vicky tries to tell him that the locusts were all drones but the examination proves that the locusts are breeding.  Colt, Vicky, [[USDA]] Agent Greg Ballard ([[Kirk B.R. Woller|Kirk Woller]]) and a group of men find the locusts' nest and the men spray pesticides to kill the larvae and locusts. This irritates the locusts and they attack the group. Colt, Vicky and Greg are the only survivors. This leads Colt to wonder why they were not attacked. Back at the headquarters of the USDA, Greg decides that the only option they have is to spray the locusts with UD-66, the most dangerous chemical weapon on the planet. Vicky tells Greg to issue the order despite Colt telling her that if they spray it, plants will not grow back for 10 years.   Meanwhile, the swarm of locusts attacks an amusement park off the major highway. Hundreds of people at the amusement park are eaten alive by the locusts. Back at the laboratory, Colt (who had taken sample larvae from the nest) examines the locust larva to try to figure out why they didn't attack Vicky; he then tries on some live adult locusts and discovers that chemical pesticides ''attract'' them. Greg then gathers a large amount of livestock in a field and the locusts arrive. He orders a helicopter to drop the pesticide which had been changed to [[UD-45]]. Despite Colt trying to get to the field to tell Greg and Vicky what he has discovered, the helicopter drops the pesticide and the pilots are attacked by the swarm, destroying the helicopter. Colt then decides to use the organic pesticide he developed on the locust swarm which has now attacked the town of Prairie and during the attack Gary who was trying to flee is killed by the locusts. Colt flies a [[Fixed-wing aircraft|plane]] over the city and drops the pesticide and the swarm of locusts dies instantly. But before they can celebrate, two larger swarms appear over the city and this time, Vicky's father, Russ, decides to lure the locusts into the crop dome using the pheromone lure. The pheromone works and the locusts fly into the crop dome. Russ then sacrifices his life by going into the dome and programming it to self-destruct. The crop dome explodes, killing all of the locusts, but there it is one more truck with possibly with hundreds of hungry locusts in the rear compartment headed towards another crop dome. The boxes read: Live Specimens

One day, Skip is given [[polyurethane]] wheels for the skateboards in his shop, Zephyr Surf Shop. Teenager Sid, a friend of the boys who works in the same shop, invites Tony, Jay, Stacy and the other locals to test the new wheels. They are all amazed as the polyurethane wheels allow the skateboards to make the same carves on flat ground as surf boards on the waves. After witnessing what Todd Levy from the Eastern Shore of Maryland could now do with the wheels, Skip decides to add to his already famous surf team, a skate team, the [[Z-Boys]]. The team proves to be a success; winning many contests, Stacy, Jay, and Tony gain popularity from locals across Venice.  A period of hot weather reduces the surf at the pier and the official declaration of a drought means swimming pools cannot be filled with water. Taking advantage of this the Z-Boys start sneaking into local backyard pools to skate in, ignoring Skip's practice sessions, which angers him. After winning many major contests, the Z-Boys become more and more famous, appearing in various magazines. Stacy, Jay, and Tony start getting noticed by major skating companies looking to take the boys from Skip. One night, Skip throws a party at his shop to celebrate the success of the team. A company owner, Topper Burks, enters the party and convinces Tony that Skip is holding him back, and that it's time to make him famous worldwide. Tony accepts his offer and leaves the team. Jay leaves the team as well, looking to make more money to help his mom pay the rent on their apartment. Despite Skip's desperate offers to keep him on the team, Stacy is the last to leave, as he begins getting offers to skate as well as to appear in T.V. Sad and angry, Skip decides to shut down the Zephyr Skate Team.  The three boys become major celebrities. Tony and Stacy now skate for money rather than the passion that Jay continues to skate for. They become enemies of some sort and compete against each other in various contests. Stacy appears on the original [[Charlie's Angels]] show while Tony starts creating his own commercials to manufacture his popular boards and merchandise. Jay is offered $10,000 to appear in a commercial sponsoring the toy, [[Slinky]]. However, he refuses, as he has become a much harder person than before. Soon, things start going out of control; at a major skating championship that they all take part in, Tony gets into a fight with another skater in the middle of the stadium, and gets violently knocked out, hospitalizing him and temporarily halting his career. Jay leaves the company he had endorsed when they sacrifice quality for cheap materials. Stacy ends up winning the competition.  Back in Venice, the pier that the Z-Boys use to surf around burns down, which affects them all. Jay shaves his hair and becomes a gang member. Skip, still selling surfboards in his shop, finally decides to settle down and continues his passion of sanding and creating surfboards, as well as solving his financial troubles by selling his shop and is seen singing "[[Maggie May (Rod Stewart song)|Maggie May]]". Sid's long-time equilibrium problem turns out to be caused by a [[brain tumor]], and he undergoes surgery. Though Stacy, Tony, and Jay have all gone their separate ways, they all show up at the same time to visit Sid. Stacy reveals that he is leaving his company to start his own. Sid's father empties their pool for them to skate in. Stacy, Tony, and Jay skate the pool and bring Sid into the fun on his wheel chair, referencing all the good times they had before they became a skate team.  Closing cards reveal that Tony Alva went on to be a very successful skater and skating's first world champion (stating that he still sneaks into backyard pools); Stacy Peralta started [[Powell Peralta]], a modern popular skating company that included a 14-year-old [[Tony Hawk]] as part of its team; and Jay, too, achieved the only kind of success at skating and surfing he really cared about, becoming known as the 'spark that started the flame'. Sid later died of brain cancer. His father's pool was kept empty and is known as the DogBowl.  
Lord of War
 In the early 1980s, Yuri Orlov ([[Nicolas Cage]]), the eldest son of a family of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian refugees]], is visiting a [[Brighton Beach]] restaurant, where he witnesses a [[Russian Mafia|Russian mobster]] kill two would-be assassins holding [[Kalashnikov rifle|Kalashnikov assault rifles]]. He is inspired to go into the [[Arms Trade|arms trade]], comparing the constant need for weapons to the similar human need for food. After completing his first sale, Yuri convinces his brother Vitaly ([[Jared Leto]]) to become his partner, and they leave their jobs at the family restaurant behind.  Yuri's first big break comes in the [[1982 Lebanon War]], when he sells guns to all sides of the conflict, despite witnessing war crimes and atrocities. As Yuri becomes more successful in the war's aftermath, his business comes to the attention of [[Interpol]], and in particular idealistic agent Jack Valentine ([[Ethan Hawke]]).  Vitaly becomes addicted to cocaine after a Colombian drug lord uses drugs to pay for an arms deal. Yuri checks Vitaly into [[drug rehabilitation]], and continues business alone. He lures childhood crush Ava Fontaine ([[Bridget Moynahan]]) to a false photo shoot, where they fall in love and subsequently get married.  After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Yuri flies to [[Ukraine]] and illegally buys tanks and weapons through his uncle, a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] general. Yuri expands to Africa, and begins a business relationship with Andre Baptiste Sr. ([[Eamonn Walker]]), a ruthless dictator waging a never-ending civil war in [[Liberia]]. During one flight into Africa, Yuri's cargo plane is intercepted by Valentine and forced to land. Yuri escapes arrest by landing in a remote area, and distributing the aircraft's illegal cargo to the locals. Unable to charge Yuri, Valentine tells Ava he is an [[arms trafficking|arms dealer]], prompting her to confront him and demand he stop his illegal business. For a time, Yuri agrees, but Andre Baptiste Sr. offers him even more money and he soon returns.  Yuri convinces Vitaly to come along on a sale in [[Sierra Leone]] in 2001, where a militia force allied with Baptiste is visibly preparing to destroy a refugee camp. Sympathizing with the refugees, Vitaly pleads with Yuri to abandon the deal, but Yuri refuses, arguing that if they do the militia will also kill them. Stricken with guilt, Vitaly steals a pair of grenades, destroying one of the weapon trucks and killing Baptiste Jr. Vitaly is shot and killed. Yuri reluctantly accepts half of the original diamond payment for the remaining weapons.  At home, Ava discovers Yuri's cache of his arms-dealing activities. She leaves with their son while Yuri's parents disown him after learning the circumstances surrounding the death of Vitaly. Yuri attempts to bring back the body of Vitaly with a forged death certificate, but the [[U.S. Customs]] finds a bullet in Vitaly's corpse, so Yuri is arrested. In an interrogation room, Valentine presents Yuri with his charges and informs Yuri that he will be sent to prison for many life sentences. In response, Yuri correctly predicts that he will be released by one of Valentine's superiors, as a "necessary evil" who distributes weapons so major governments can deny involvement.

The Longest Yard (2005 film)
  Paul Crewe ([[Adam Sandler]]) is a former [[National Football League|NFL]] player who, one night, gets drunk and goes [[joyride (crime)|joyriding]] in the [[Bentley]] of his girlfriend ([[Courteney Cox]] in an uncredited role), crashing it. It is revealed that he was accused of [[shaving points]] in a big game, although it was never proven.   In prison, Warden Rudolph Hazen ([[James Cromwell]]), wishing to boost his prison's reputation for future elections as State Governor, uses threats and confinement in a [[Box (torture)|hot box]] to coerce Crewe into helping the prison guards' football team, led by the hostile Captain Knauer ([[William Fichtner]]). Crewe informs Hazen that what Hazen's team needs is a tune-up game to boost the guards' confidence, and is therefore coerced to form an inmate team to play against the guards. He does so with the help of a newfound friend, Caretaker ([[Chris Rock]]). They start off with a poorly organized team, before being noticed by another prisoner, former college football star Nate Scarborough ([[Burt Reynolds]]), who decides to help coach the team by gathering several intimidating inmates as a boost to the team's strength.  Caretaker tells Crewe that they need more [[African American|"brothers"]] on the team. When Crewe goes to the basketball court to ask the black inmates to join the team, their leader, Deacon Moss ([[Michael Irvin]]) rebuffs him. Crewe challenges Deacon to a one-on-one basketball game, saying that if he wins, the brothers will join the team, and if Deacon wins, Crewe will leave them alone. Deacon accepts, and despite Deacon's undisguised [[Personal foul (basketball)|personal fouls]] in which he elbows, punches or grabs Crewe, Crewe continues without complaint. On the game-winning shot, Crewe cleanly steals the ball from Deacon and scores, but Deacon calls a foul. Realizing he won't be allowed to win, Crewe lets Deacon score the final shot. Although Deacon beats Crewe, one of the brothers, a fast runner named Earl Megget ([[Nelly]]), impressed with Crewe's decision to take the beating, joins the football team as its [[Running back|running back]]. When the guards learn of this, they confront Earl in an attempt to provoke an assault by him by saying the racial epithet "nigger", but Earl does not allow himself to be provoked despite intimidation and minor abuse. Having witnessed this, the other "brothers", including Deacon, decide to join the team too.  Hazen and the guards continue attempts to hinder Crewe's team by flooding their field, but the team decides to practice in the mud anyway.  Inmate Unger ([[David Patrick Kelly]]) spies on the activities of the inmates and after being pressured by the guards, rigs Creweâs radio with an explosive. Caretaker unknowingly enters the cell to give a photo gift to Crewe, but is killed when he tries to turn the dial on the radio.  On game day, the inmates are revitalized in the wake of Caretaker's murder when Crewe reveals Caretaker's last gift to the team, quality gear and uniforms from his cousin at [[Reebok]] with the team name "Mean Machine" on the uniforms. The Mean Machine overcomes a rough start, due to individual inmates' attempts to retaliate against guards for the abuse they've suffered. Crewe angrily tells the inmates that winning the game is more important and will damage the guards more than their personal grudges, and gets them to play as a team. The first half ends with the score tied. The angered Hazen informs Crewe in private that if he does not lose he will be charged for Caretaker's murder. Crewe acquiesces to Hazen's threat, asking that the guards refrain from using excessive force on the field after getting a comfortable lead, to which Hazen agrees to do so after they obtain a two touchdown lead. After Crewe fakes an injury in order to leave the field, his teammates voice their displeasure over his obvious deserting over the team.  After seeing that Hazen has broken his promise and two members of the Mean Machine are injured, Crewe asks Skitchy if the time spent in jail for punching the warden was worth it. Skitchy replies, "It was worth every goddamn second," and inspired Crewe returns to the field. The team initially doubts Creweâs resolve and allows him to be sacked twice. After running for a first down on 4th and Long, Crewe, realizing that his inmates are still not protecting him due to his prior actions, calls a huddle, and admits to the point shaving that disgraced him, and to the injury that he faked as a result of Hazen's threat, and sabotage to the other inmates, and asks for their forgiveness, putting his hands in the middle of all of them. Moss puts his hand in, followed by the rest of the team.  The Mean Machine, united again as a team, quickly scores two touchdowns to cut the guards' lead to 35â28. After Megget is injured after a long run, Scarborough comes in for one play as replacement and scores a touchdown off a trick play involving a fumble called a [[Fumblerooski]]. Mean Machine decides to go for the two-point conversion and the win. As they get up to the line they seem to be confused, and Crewe and Scarborough start arguing in order to trick the guards. Moss gets the snap and passes it to Crewe, who scores the winning conversion, winning the game. Knauer, with a newfound respect for Crewe, tells him that he showed extraordinary nerve, and lets him know that he will vouch that Crewe had nothing to do with Caretaker's death.  Hazen admonishes Knauer for losing a fixed game and notices that Crewe is heading towards the exit. Eagerly implying Crewe is trying to escape, Hazen orders that Crewe be shot for attempting to escape. Knauer hesitates and at the last moment realizes (and scornfully tells Hazen) that Crewe is only picking up the game football, losing a lot of respect for Hazen as he's left with a shocked look on his face. Crewe returns it to Hazen, telling him to "stick it in [his] trophy case." Moss ([[Michael Irvin]]) and Joey Battle ([[Bill Goldberg]]) give Hazen a [[Gatorade shower]], and when he tells them that this has earned them a week in the hot box, Battle defiantly yells "Who gives a shit?!"

Despite Castel's having saved his life, Ricardo does nothing to prevent Castelâs execution.  Ricardo, who had otherwise distanced himself from his family, later visits his uncle Donoso ([[Richard Bradford (actor)|Richard Bradford]]), a tobacco farmer and cigar maker. Donoso feels that while Castro may be in power now, âthe land enduresâ and he says that the farm would one day pass to Ricardo. Ricardo, however, announces that the reason for his visit is to appropriate the farm for the state. In a fit of anger, Donoso has a heart attack and dies. Ricardo, overcome by grief, attends the funeral and shortly after commits suicide.  The [[Cuban Revolution|revolution]] also has its effects on Ficoâs club. The musicianâs union, now controlled by Castro, has declared the [[saxophone]] to be an imperialist instrument and forbids its use. The club is eventually shut down on a flimsy pretext. After a chance meeting with Castro, Aurora is declared Revolutionary Widow of the Year and begins to work for the State. This causes Fico and Aurora to break apart.  Seeing the family torn apart and decimated by the revolution, Ficoâs parents beg him to leave Cuba and start a new family. Reluctantly, Fico prepares to leave, procuring exit visas for himself and Aurora. In a last chance to convince her to leave, Fico barges in on a reception for revolutionary leaders and [[Soviet Bloc]] ambassadors but Aurora refuses to go. After a last toast to a free and democratic Cuba, Fico leaves the reception. He says his goodbyes to his parents (receiving his fatherâs prized pocket watch) and leaves Cuba. At the airport, most of his money and possessions (including his fatherâs watch) are confiscated.  Fico begins a new life in New York. By working as a dishwasher and piano player at a Cuban club, he hopes to save enough money to bring the remaining members of his family to America. He again meets [[Meyer Lansky]], who offers Fico a Cuban nightclub in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. Fico again refuses. While cleaning up one night, he has another meeting with Aurora, who is in New York as part of a Cuban delegation to the [[United Nations]]. He now realizes that Aurora is like Cuba: beautiful, alluring, but ultimately damaged and unattainable. He decides now that his cause is to build a new life until he can return to the city he lost. Fico recites a poem by Cuban nationalist Father [[JosÃ© MartÃ­]] and opens a new nightclub in New York.

Lovers Lane (2005 film)
  A pair of college students from the small California town of [[Montgomery, California|Montgomery]] go to the local lovers lane, Hidden Point, to have sex, and are stabbed to death by [[The Hook|a hooded figure with a hook for a hand]]. The next night, another young couple is attacked in the same area. The man's throat is slit, and the woman narrowly escapes, being chased through the woods and to the road, where she flags down a passing car. As the ten-year college reunion, student prom, and tourist season are all fast approaching, the mayor and governor call the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] for assistance, to the annoyance of the case's initial investigator, Deputy Sarah Blake. Sarah believes these killings could be connected to the similar and still unsolved murders of her sister Laura and Laura's boyfriend, which occurred ten years ago at Hidden Point.  A curfew is set in an attempt to keep people in at night, and Sarah semi-reluctantly teams-ups with FBI Agent Roberts to work on the case. The two decide to go undercover as a couple at the college reunion, and the sexual tension between the pair grows to the point that they end up having sex in Roberts's motel room. At the reunion, Sarah's ex-boyfriend Andy and another attendee named Allison sneak into the campus [[nurses station]] to have sex, exit the building, and are attacked by the Hook, who stabs Andy in the back. Hearing Allison's screams, Sarah and Roberts rush outside, prompting the Hook to abandon his pursuit of Allison in favor of going after them.  Roberts is knocked out, and Sarah is chased back into the school, where she discovers a body stuffed in a closet with a yearbook that reads "Die Bitch Die". Sarah is eventually cornered in the gymnasium (where she finds evidence of more victims) and as the killer is about to strike her down, Allison appears, having recognized the Hook as Stanley Smith, a former classmate who was bullied relentlessly, and is now Agent Davis, Roberts's partner.  Stanley reveals he was the one who murdered Sarah's sister (one his bullies) ten years ago, and that he saw this reunion as the perfect opportunity to get his revenge on all his old tormentors (the butchering of the college students was merely a means of making the rampage look completely random). As Allison (one of the few people who were kind to him during their school days) tries to talk Stanley down, Sarah grabs a fire axe and kills Stanley with it, just as Roberts and two police officers arrive.

Marty's best friend is [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Alex|Alex]] the [[lion]], who enjoys showing off for the public and his celebrity status as "the King of New York City". Alex attempts to cheer Marty up, but Marty, still unsatisfied, gets some tips from the zoo's [[AdÃ©lie penguin|penguin]]sâ[[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Skipper|Skipper]], [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Kowalski|Kowalski]], [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Rico|Rico]], and [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Private|Private]]âwho are trying to escape the zoo, and follows them out. Alex, [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Melman|Melman]] the [[Reticulated giraffe|giraffe]], and [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Gloria|Gloria]] the [[hippopotamus]] pursue Marty in an attempt to convince him to return. The four, along with the penguins and two [[chimpanzee]]s named [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Mason and Phil|Mason and Phil]], find themselves at [[Grand Central Station]], where they are quickly sedated via [[tranquillizer gun]] when Alex's attempt to communicate with humans is mistaken for aggression. The zoo, under pressure from anti-captivity activists, is forced to ship the escaped animals by sea to a [[Kenya]]n wildlife preserve. During their travels, the penguins escape from their enclosure and take over the ship, intent on taking it to [[Antarctica]]. Their antics on the bridge cause the crates containing Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria to fall overboard and wash ashore on [[Madagascar]], because the strap securing the crates broke off due to Alex and Marty fighting.  The animals are soon able to regroup, initially believing themselves to be at the [[San Diego Zoo]]. Upon exploring, however, they come across a pack of [[lemur]]s, led by [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#King Julien XIII|King Julien XIII]] the [[ring-tailed lemur]], and learn their true location. Alex blames Marty for their predicament and attempts to signal for help to get back to civilization. Marty, on the other hand, finds the wild to be exactly what he was looking for, with Gloria and Melman soon joining him in enjoying the island. Alex eventually comes around, but, deprived from the raw [[steak]]s he was provided with at the zoo, his [[prey drive]] begins to show as hunger kicks in. The group is accepted by the lemurs, though King Julien's adviser, [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Maurice|Maurice]] the [[aye-aye]], cautions them about Alex's predatory nature. King Julien ignores Maurice's concerns and persuades the group to help the lemurs fend off the [[fossa (animal)|fossa]], who hunt the lemurs as prey. While Alex initially scares the fossa away and is worshiped by the lemurs, later, compelled by hunger, he attacks Marty. Realizing that Alex is now a threat, King Julien banishes him to the far side of the island where the fossa live. Seeing what has happened to Alex, and how difficult it is to survive with so many predators around the island, Marty begins to regret his decision to leave the zoo.  The penguins, having been to Antarctica and found that it wasn't what they had in mind, land the ship at Madagascar. Seeing this as a chance to return Alex to New York, Marty rushes after his friend against the wishes of Melman and Gloria. Marty attempts to convince the now grizzled, starving Alex to return, but Alex refuses out of fear of attacking Marty again. The penguins, Gloria, and Melman go to find Marty, but are trapped by the fossa. At the last minute, Alex overcomes his predatory instincts and scares the fossa away from the lemur territory forever. The lemurs regain their respect for Alex, and the penguins help him satisfy his hunger through [[sushi]]. As the lemurs throw a farewell celebration for the foursome, the penguins decide not to break the news that the ship has run out of fuel.

The Magic Roundabout (film)
  The film begins as the [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] Zebedee, a red [[jack-in-the-box]]-like creature, is having a nightmare about being chased by a rampaging blue jack-in-the-box creature named Zeebad.  The film then starts with Dougal sneaking around the carousel. He goes so far as to place a tack in the road to pop a sweet cart's tyre, thinking to be rewarded for watching the cart. After convincing the driver, Mr. Grimsdale to leave, Dougal accidentally starts the cart up again and causes it to crash into the titular magic [[Carousel|roundabout]] at the centre of the village. Zeebad from Zebedee's nightmare emerges from the top and flies away, followed shortly after by a Foot Guard figurine that is thrown off the roundabout. The roundabout freezes over, trapping repairman Mr. Rusty, Dougal's young owner Florence, and two other children named Basil and Coral within an icy cell.  The villagers, who are all animals, are horrified by this development, and call upon Zebedee for help. He explains that the roundabout acted as a mystical prison for the evil ice wizard Zeebad. With it broken, Zeebad is free to work his magic on the world again (it is implied he started the first [[ice age]]). The only way to stop Zeebad's freedom from freezing the world again is by collecting three magic diamonds (one of which is supposed to be hidden on the roundabout, while the other two are hidden at separate locations far beyond the village); placing all three diamonds in their respective slots on the roundabout will re-imprison Zeebad and undo his magic, but if Zeebad retrieves them first then their power will allow him to freeze the Sun itself. Zebedee sends Dougal the well-meaning cheeky chappy but [[slacker]] [[Skye Terrier|dog]], Brian the [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] [[snail]], Ermintrude the [[opera]]-singing [[cow]] and Dylan the [[hippie]] [[rabbit]], to accomplish this mission along with a magic train who can be summoned by a magic remote. Meanwhile, when Zeebad crash lands after escaping the roundabout, he animates the Foot Guard figurine, Sam the Soldier, to be his henchman and enlists him to find the enchanted diamonds first. Meanwhile, Zebedee's fellowship makes camp in the icy mountains near Zeebad's old lair. Dougal wanders off during the night and is captured by Zeebad. Ermintrude breaks him out of his prison; after a short chase, Zebedee shows up to battle his evil counterpart. Zeebad eventually gains the upper hand, freezing Zebedee and collapsing the cliff on which he stands, presumably killing him.  Mourning for their friend, Dougal and his friends embark to recover the diamonds. This task takes them to a lava-bordered volcano and an ancient temple filled with booby-traps and evil skeleton guards (at which point Dylan reveals an exceptional knowledge of several types of martial arts), but Zeebad captures both the diamonds from these respective locations; leaving the gang's only hope of stopping Zeebad freezing the world in ice to be getting back to the roundabout and to the final diamond before Zeebad does. The gang are forced along the way to leave Train behind when his wheel is broken, leaving them to return to the village on their own through the snowy barren wasteland the world is now freezing into. Zeebad, after having abandoned Sam the Soldier to die wounded in the snow, beats the gang to the now-frozen village, but is unable to find the third diamond anywhere. Sam then arrives on an [[moose|elk]], having realised he's been following the wrong commander in Zeebad and that his true duty is to protect the roundabout against Zeebad, and tries to make a stand and charge against him but is easily defeated. Having learned Sam was in fact on the roundabout, Zeebad discovers that the third diamond is and always was hidden inside Sam, and removes it from him (ending Sam's life as a result).  Just as Dougal and the gang finally make it back to the village, Zeebad, with all three diamonds now in his possession, uses the diamonds to complete his powers' freezing effect on the world by freezing the Sun. However, Ermintrude, Brian, Dylan, and finally Dougal refuse to give up, and intervene to stop Zeebad; getting past Zeebad's attacks to the diamonds, and getting each of them one-by-one into their places on the roundabout until only the third diamond is left. Though Zeebad beats the gang to the diamond and seemingly secures his victory, the timely arrival of a healed Train knocks the diamond out of Zeebad's reach and gives Dougal the chance to place it in the roundabout's final slot. With all three diamonds placed on the roundabout, Zeebad is reimprisoned, and the world is thawed and turned back to normal; restoring Zebedee to his friends, and freeing the people.  Of those trapped in the roundabout, Florence is comatose, but is revived by an anxious Dougal. The elk (whose colour had been changed from brown to blue by Zeebad and helped Dougal's friends find Dougal in the earlier scenes of the film), is restored to his true colour by Zebedee. As everyone goes for a ride on the roundabout, they discover it still doesn't work, because Sam is still lifeless. At this point, Sam is restored and then reverted to his inanimate form, and placed back on the roundabout which functions once again. Dougal, who vowed to give up sugar when it seemed all was lost, forgets his former pledge completely, but now realises the true value of his friends and the good qualities of selflessness, courage, and humility.  Two [[mid-credits scene]]s follow: one reveals Zeebad back in his prison, which, to his chagrin, is a molten lava cave. In another, Zebedee delivers his famous catchphrase to the audience, "Time for bed", before disappearing.

Frightened by the vision, Rosa tries to escape but gets abducted and double-crossed when she is suddenly confronted by Ah Soon. She quickly finds out that Ah Soon is also a ghost himself when she tries to stab him only to realize that the man would not show a scar or any visible wound. In the past, Ah Soon committed suicide shortly after the death of Esther but instead of passing to the afterlife, he chose to return to the house to find the spirit of Esther, whom he was in love with. From behind her, Mr. Teo knocks Rosa unconscious and ties her up. When Rosa awakens, she is told by Mrs. Teo that the Teo family has long believed that ghosts can also marry and their whole motive for inviting her to Singapore was to sacrifice her so that she would be [[Ghost marriage (Chinese)|wed to their dead son]]. But when they try to hang Rosa, Ah Soon suddenly remembers the way his father brutally murdered Esther the year before and tells his parents that he does not want to see any more deaths in the house.  In a scuffle, Ah Soon accidentally pushes Mr. Teo into an altar, spilling oil on him. Esther's spirit then ignites the oil, burning him to death. Rosa manages to break free with the help of Esther's spirit and tries to escape. Mrs. Teo picks up a knife and tries to finish her off once and for all. Rosa dashes out of the house and crosses the road with Mrs. Teo close behind. Rosa stumbles and falls on the other side of the road, but as Mrs. Teo approaches her menacingly with the knife in hand, an oncoming truck hits Mrs. Teo and kills her instantly. Rosa breathes a sigh of relief as the camera pans over Mrs. Teo's dead body.  In the final sequence, Rosa is seen heading to the airport to fly back to her hometown on the last day of July when the gates of hell are closing. She takes with her the jar containing Esther's ashes as she enters the airport while the ghosts of the Teo family watches her disappear beyond the doors.

Man of the House (2005 film)
 At the beginning of the film, two lonesome [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], Roland Sharp ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]) and Maggie Swanson ([[Liz Vassey]]), are going to a church in order to question Percy Stevens ([[Cedric the Entertainer]]) about the whereabouts of his former prison roommate, Morgan Ball, who they want to testify against organized crime boss John Cortland. Percy is indignant, telling Sharp and Swanson that he is a "man of God" and has not spoken with Ball in years. However, Percy's cellphone rings, displaying Ball's name.  Sharp and Swanson track down Ball to the warehouse, where Ball gives Sharp a key in an attempt to buy him off. Instead, Sharp takes the key and forces Ball outside, where FBI agent Eddie Zane ([[Brian Van Holt]]) is waiting. As they talk, a sniper begins shooting, wounding Swanson and giving Ball a chance to escape. It is revealed the sniper is after Ball, and a group of cheerleaders from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] witness his murder. Agent Zane is found shot in the arm next to Ball's body and claims he didn't see the sniper.  Anne ([[Christina Milian]]), Teresa ([[Paula GarcÃ©s]]), Evie ([[Monica Keena]]), Heather ([[Vanessa Ferlito]]) and Barb ([[Kelli Garner]]) are taken to the police station, where they all have conflicting descriptions of the shooter. Sharp is given the task of protecting the girls at all times, because their fathers are worried about them. The information is relayed to him by the [[Governor of Texas]] ([[Rick Perry]]).  It is revealed that Sharp is divorced and has a daughter, Emma ([[Shannon Marie Woodward]]) who is in high school and doesn't feel as though her father had ever been around. John Cortland is been exonerated from all charges pressed against him due to a lack of evidence. FBI Agent Zane is revealed to be working with Cortland, having killed Ball and shot himself in the arm.   Cortland scolds Zane for letting some "loose ends" escape, and Zane begins searching for Sharp and the cheerleaders; he also kills the sniper he hired. With Swanson in the hospital recovering from her near-fatal wound, Sharp and two additional rangers must now pick the girls up from school and secure their sorority house. Sharp moves in with the girls and the two young men with him move into the fraternity house across the street, where they end up busting a drug deal.  Sharp sets some ground rules, including no cell phones. He also tells them to "cover up in his presence" (referring to the girls' revealing clothes). When they fail to comply, he orders a massive industrial air conditioner, forcing them to dress warmly. Sharp is posing as a cheerleading coach specializing in conditioning, and at a [[Texas Longhorns football|Longhorns]] football game he tackles an opposing team's mascot when the mascot approaches the girls with a gun, later revealed to be a water gun. Other humorous mishaps occur, but Sharp's relationship with the girls begins to strengthen; Barb even begins to develop a crush on him.  However, Sharp finds himself attracted to Barb's English teacher Molly ([[Anne Archer]]) who calls him into her office to complain about Barb's [[plagiarism]]. Later he invites her over for dinner, which the girls coach him through using an earpiece and tiny video screen. After they fall asleep, he turns it off and woos Molly himself. He admits to the girls about his last failed marriage and the way he feels about his estranged daughter. This interests Evie, who has a 4.0 [[GPA]] and wants to write a paper on Emma. She uses the house's "emergency phone" to call her, revealing Sharp's location to Zane, who had contacted Emma.  Sharp takes the girls to a "spirit rally", where he is forced to give a speech about cheerleading. He becomes more and more impassioned, proving to the girls he finally "gets it". The night is ruined, however, when Sharp realizes in the nick of time that somebody put a bomb under their van, and Teresa (who was convinced that nobody was after them) is almost killed when her seatbelt gets stuck. Sharp saves her, and she admits that maybe someone is trying to kill them.  Evie tells Sharp she contacted Emma, and when Sharp calls his daughter he learns that Zane has her. He tells Sharp to take the key Ball gave him to open a lockbox, both of them unaware the cheerleaders are listening in. The next day Sharp gets the money out of the lockbox and drives to where Zane instructs him. Zane gives Sharp instructions over a cell phone, telling him he will shoot Emma if Sharp disobeys. After Sharp handcuffs himself to the steering wheel, Zane thanks him and tells him he's a "good parent." Zane takes off with the money, Sharp's keys and phone, and Emma.  Zane and Emma get on a bus, but as it pulls away Sharp sees Barb in the back. As he wonders what is going on, Heather gets in the car with him and picks his handcuffs. They take off after the bus in a stolen [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. On the bus, Teresa pretends to go into labor and Evie demands the bus be stopped. She attempts to steal the bag with the money, but Zane pulls a gun and Evie runs away from the bus. Zane forces all of the other passengers and the driver out, taking over driving the bus himself.  Emma is rescued by the cheerleaders, but Zane attempts to drive to Mexico with the bag to hide. Sharp shoots a wheel, causing the bus to flip over 90 degrees. Zane gets out the bus, his face injured after he hits the bus's ceiling. The [[Mexico-United States border]] closes and the border officers draw guns on him, forcing him to surrender. Sharp shoots the gun out of Zane's hand, and handcuffs him with the very same cuffs Heather freed him from earlier. He and Emma are reunited. At the end of the film, Cortland is arrested and taken back to court, Sharp and Molly are married, and Emma and the cheerleaders are part of the wedding.  
Man with the Screaming Brain
 [[Bruce Campbell]] plays William Cole, the wealthy CEO of a [[United States|U.S.]] drug company who travels to [[Bulgaria]] with his wife, Jackie ([[Antoinette Byron]]) in the hopes of diversifying his company's financial interests.  Cole is a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] [[Ugly American (pejorative)|ugly American]] who constantly complains about the lack of [[Americanization]] of the former communist country. They're driven to a hotel by a taxi driver, and former [[KGB]] agent, named Yegor Stragov ([[Vladimir Kolev]]), in which Yegor gives William a ring to give to Jackie. While William is at the construction of a subway, Jackie secretly cheats on William with Yegor.  William gets back to the hotel and bumps into the hotel maid and gypsy, Tatoya ([[Tamara Gorski]]), who kills men that date and dump her. Jackie then comes in, catches William kissing Tatoya and dumps him. William chases Tatoya, who had taken William's money and ring (which is revealed to be Tatoya's that she gave to Yegor when they dated), and Tatoya knocks him in the head with a pipe outside the hotel. Yegor witnesses this and so Tatoya kills Yegor with his own gun.  A vengeful Jackie has Cole's life support plug pulled in hospital, and then goes to Gypsy Town where Tatoya lives and attempts to kill her, only to have Tatoya kill her by throwing her down a flight of stairs. Meanwhile, William wakes up in the warehouse of a Russian scientist named Dr. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov ([[Stacy Keach]]), and his idiotic assistant Pavel ([[Ted Raimi]]), who had taken damaged parts of William's brain and replaced it with healthy tissue from Yegor's. When William runs out of the warehouse, he discovers he can hear Yegor's voice in his head, and they both plan to "get the woman that killed us both". Jackie, who had also been picked up by Dr. Ivanov and Pavel, has her brain put inside a robot, and so she escapes and also plans to exact revenge on Tatoya.  William/Yegor and Robo-Jackie chase Tatoya around town. William gets involved in a car crash with his foot underneath a car and Tatoya makes another attempt to kill William by setting the leaking car gasoline alight. Jackie saves him and is presumed dead in the explosion. After avoiding some bar punks that believe William "raped Tatoya on her wedding day", William/Yegor begin suffering brain damage due to their cells not able to coexist in the same head. Jackie, who had survived the explosion, appears and attempts to kill Tatoya by throwing her off a bridge, until Jackie stabs her brain, causing her to malfunction, and has Jackie thrown off the bridge. William chases Tatoya through the subway construction and the sewer and finally kills Tatoya by dropping her in sewer river, after obtaining the ring back. William and Jackie then confess their love for each other before Jackie's batteries finally die, as does William due to the brain cells of him and Yegor. Pavel brings William, Jackie and Tatoya's body back to Dr. Ivanov to fix them, as he had earlier found a way to make William and Yegor's brain cells coexist in the same head.  The movie ends with William back in the U.S. six months later, still sharing his body with Yegor's brain. He goes to a brain trauma benefit with Jackie, whose brain had been transferred into Tatoya's body.  
The Man (2005 film)
 The story starts with Andy Fiddler ([[Eugene Levy]]) preparing a speech that he is going to give to a dental convention in [[Detroit]]. He works for a dental supply company, and lives in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. Meanwhile, in Detroit, a [[arsenal|federal armory]] (weapons room) of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF) has been robbed of assault rifles, handguns and ammunition. An ATF agent was killed and [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] agent Peters ([[Miguel Ferrer]]) suspects the dead agent and his partner Agent Derrick Vann ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) were in on the robbery.  After a visit to his informant Booty ([[Anthony Mackie]]) (who is later gunned down), Vann, attempting to clear his name, sets up a buy. He is to go to a diner and be reading a copy of the newspaper ''[[USA Today]]'' to be recognized. Unfortunately, Andy is also in the diner, and he has a copy of ''USA Today''. He is mistaken for Vann. A menacing Englishman called Joey ([[Luke Goss]]) sits next to Andy and hands him a paper bag with "his taste" in it then leaves.  The bag contains a cell phone and a gun, which Andy pulls out. The waitress of the diner thinks that Andy is there to rob the place and panics. An arriving Vann arrests Andy, before realizing that the gun traffickers mistook Andy for Vann himself. The received cell phone rings and Vann answers the call. The caller is Joey, who wants "Turk" (the pseudonym that Vann used when setting up the buy) to drop $20,000 dollars in a certain trash can. Vann reveals that he has the money, but now needs Andy to deliver it.  The initial attempt to deliver the money to the gun traffickers fails due to the interference of a bystander. Vann gets another cell phone call from Joey, asking him what happened. He tells Joey that there were complications, and Joey agrees to arrange another attempt at delivery. Meanwhile, Andy tries to escape and Vann shoots after him, grazing him with a gunshot to the rear. Andy uses the cell phone to call the local police for help, resulting in the capture of both of them by arriving squad cars. The police releases Vann after learning that he is an ATF agent, but they discover there is an outstanding warrant for Andy. He reportedly only purchased a stolen rug without knowing of its origins, but he is still suspected of criminal activity.  Vann arranges the release of Andy, to use him in his case against the gun traffickers. Vann tries to contact gun dealer Manny Cortez for help with the case, but finds Manny murdered in his own house. Andy attempts to escape again and fails. Vann then receives a phone call from his ex-wife Dara ([[Rachael Crawford]]), who reminds him about the upcoming dance recital of their daughter Kate (Tomorrow Baldwin Montgomery). He then receives another phone call from Joey, who now asks for 500,000 dollars for the whole batch of weapons. Vann has Andy pose as a powerful trafficker for a meeting with Joey in a restaurant. Andy improvises by returning the cell phone to Joey and telling him that their next meeting will be on his terms. Andy plans to use the next meeting to set up a trap for Joey. Andy then convinces Vann that he should attend his daughter's recital, and both men attend it.  Andy and Vann eventually arrange a meeting with Joey, but (against Andy's original plan) they have failed to arrange backup from any law enforcement agency. Joey has never met Vann before and asks who he is. Andy claims that Vann is someone who will do anything they tell him. Vann admits this, and claims that he is betraying the service in pursuit of monetary gain. Joey is suitably convinced and agrees to work with him. Following the meeting, Andy and Vann part ways.  Andy stays in Detroit as planned and delivers his speech. He is then captured by agent Peters, who wants to use him against Vann. Peters claims that Vann is corrupt, that he is actually trying to buy the guns for himself, and that Vann himself murdered Booty, Manny Cortez and Vann's own partner. Peters wants Andy to wear a wire and get a confession out of Vann. Meanwhile, back at ATF offices, Vann is suspended, and his boss ([[Susie Essman]]) tells him that Andy was setting him up. Andy, now wired, enters Vann's office and says they need to talk. The two men drive to the exchange point to deliver the money. Vann suspects that Andy is wired and asks him about it. Andy admits it.  Vann and Andy enter the barn where the exchange is going to take place. This time Joey is skeptical of their motives and pulls a gun on Vann. The law enforcement agents hear everything through the wire, and soon arrive to arrest Joey. Andy manages to disarm Joey, though Vann still receives a bullet wound in the buttocks. Vann delivers Andy to the airport for his flight back to Milwaukee and the two men say goodbye. Vann accidentally sets off the [[metal detector]]s in the airport and blames it on Andy. The story ends with a protesting Andy being led away by [[airport security]] for a [[body cavity search]].  
Man-Thing (film)
 At Dark Waters, a Native American sacred land containing an enigmatic swamp spirit, a teenager is murdered by a plant-like monster. The following day, young replacement sheriff Kyle Williams reaches Bywater and meets with deputy sheriff Fraser, who tells him the previous sheriff is among 47 missing persons since oil tycoon Fred Schist bought the ancient tribal lands from shaman and [[Seminole]] chieftain Ted Sallis, the first to disappear. Schist claimed Sallis had sold the lands legally and then escaped with the money. Schist then asked the sheriff for help: Local protestors opposed his perfectly legal activities, and [[mestizo]] scoundrel Renee Laroque was sabotaging his facilities. Williams investigates this while trying to find an explanation for the missing people, some of which were found brutally murdered with plants growing from inside their bodies. Photographer Mike Ploog and shaman Pete Horn tell Williams local legends about the guardian spirit, suggesting that it could be real.  As sabotage and murder continue, Williams investigates the swamp with Fraser and finds the previous sheriff's corpse. Medical examiner Val Mayerik admits that the previous sheriff had ordered him to file the deaths as alligator attacks, even if Mayerik believed otherwise.  Williams and Fraser try to track Laroque, who lives in the swamp, by using a canoe. At the same time, Schist sends the Thibadeux brothers, local thugs, to track and murder Laroque. The monster in the swamp finds the Thibadeux and kills them. Williams is ensnared by Laroque, who admits having helped Schist buy the lands. Laroque claims that Sallis was opposed to the sale; Laroque insists that the guardian spirit would keep on murdering until Schist stops desecrating the sacred swamp. Fraser tries to help Laroque, but the Man-Thing timely appears and murders Fraser; Laroque knocks Williams down and escapes. Williams wakes up and finds Ploog, who has blurry pictures of the monster; the sheriff seizes the photographs and forbids Ploog to come back to the swamp.  The following day, Williams interviews Horn and Schist, with the help of schoolteacher Teri Richards' help. Williams starts having romantic feelings for Richards. Horn goes to the swamp and tries to stop the Man-Thing with prayers and sacrificing his own life. The monster kills Horn, but is not otherwise affected by his efforts. That night, Mayerik autopsies the old sheriff and finds a bullet. He tries to tell Williams, but he is back at the swamp, unreachable. Mayerik tells Richards, and she goes to the swamp to tell Williams. Meanwhile, Ploog had returned to the swamp, trying to get a picture of the monster. Instead he startles Fred Schist, who was in the swamp to murder Laroque. Schist shoots and kills Ploog. Soon afterward, Laroque ambushes and defeats Schist's son and minion Jake.  Williams finds Ploog's corpse and reasons that Schist murdered Ploog. He then meets Richards, who tells him about Mayerik's autopsy. Williams concludes that Schist is guilty of several murders, trying to incriminate Laroque simply to avoid punishment. According to Schist's confession to Laroque, he murdered Sallis and buried him in Dark Waters. Due to the magic embedded in the soil, Sallis returned as the Man-Thing. Richards reveals that she can guide Williams to Laroque's lair, but the Man-Thing starts chasing them. He chases them to the drilling tower at Dark Waters. In the tower, Schist is leveling his weapon at Laroque in an attempt to prevent Laroque from blowing it away with dynamite. Laroque nonetheless tries to detonate his bomb and is shot and wounded by Schist; Schist then wounds Williams.  However, the Man-Thing arrives and brutally murders Schist by filling his body with oil. The Man-Thing then moves toward Williams and Richards. Laroque sacrifices himself shouting at the monster and blowing the bomb. The monster survives the flames, but then is absorbed back to the land.

Man of God (film)
 A middle-aged Rabbi ([[Peter Weller]]) has his faith shaken by a series of events that includes an affair and being stalked by a hate group.  
Manderlay
 The film is told in eight straight chapters: # In which we happen upon Manderlay and meet the people there # "The freed enterprise of Manderlay" # "The Old Lady's Garden" # In which Grace means business # "Shoulder to Shoulder" # Hard times at Manderlay # "Harvest" # In which Grace settles with Manderlay and the film ends  Set in 1933, the film takes up the story of Grace and her father after burning the town of Dogville at the end of the previous film. Grace and her father travel in convoy with a number of gunmen through rural [[Alabama]] where they stop briefly outside a plantation called Manderlay. As the gangsters converse, a black woman emerges from Manderlay's front gates complaining that someone is about to be whipped for stealing a bottle of wine.  Grace enters the plantation and learns that within it, [[slavery]] persists, roughly 70 years after the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. Grace is appalled, and insists on staying at the plantation with a small contingent of gunmen and her father's lawyer, Joseph, in order to guarantee the slaves' safe transition to freedom. Shortly after Grace's father and the remaining gangsters depart, Mam, the master of the house, dies, but not before asking Grace to burn a notebook containing "Mam's Law," an exhaustive code of conduct for the entire plantation and all its inhabitants, free and slave. She reads the descriptions of each variety of slave that can be encountered, which include: * Group 1: Proudy [[Nigger]] * Group 2: Talkin' Nigger * Group 3: Weepin' Nigger * Group 4: Hittin' Nigger * Group 5: Clownin' Nigger * Group 6: Losin' Nigger * Group 7: Pleasin' Nigger (also known as a [[chameleon]], a person of the kind who can transform himself into exactly the type the beholder would like to see)  The principal seven divisions are each populated by a single adult slave at Manderlay, who congregate daily and converse on a "parade ground," with Roman numerals of the numbers 1 through 7 designating where each slave stands. "Mam's Law" contains further provisions against the use of cash by slaves, or the felling of trees on the property for timber.  All of this information disgusts Grace, and inspires her to take charge of the plantation in order to punish the slave owners and prepare the slaves for life as free individuals. In order to guarantee that the former slaves will not continue to be exploited as [[sharecroppers]], Grace orders Joseph to draw up contracts for all Manderlay's inhabitants, institutionalizing a communistic form of cooperative living in which the white family works as slaves and the blacks collectively own the plantation and its crops. Throughout this process, Grace lectures all those present about the notions of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and democracy, using rhetoric entirely in keeping with the ideology of [[racial equality]] which most contemporary Americans had yet to embrace.  However, as the film progresses, Grace fails to embed these principles in Manderlay's community in a form she considers satisfactory. Furthermore, her suggestions for improving the conditions of the community backfire on several occasions, such as using the surrounding trees for timber, which leaves the crops vulnerable to dust storms. After a year of such tribulations, the community harvests its cotton and successfully sells it, marking the high point of Grace's involvement. Subsequently she un-enthusiastically has sex with one of the ex-slaves who also steals and gambles away all of the cotton profits. Finally admitting her failure, Grace contacts her father and attempts to leave the plantation only to be stopped by the plantation's blacks. At this point it is revealed that "Mam's Law" was not conceived and enforced by Mam or any of the other whites, but instead by Wilhelm, the community's eldest member, as a means of maintaining the status quo after the abolition of slavery, protecting the blacks from a hostile outside world. As in many von Trier films, the [[Idealism|idealistic]] main character becomes frustrated by the reality he or she encounters.  
Mansquito
 Dr. Jennifer Allen ([[Musetta Vander]]) in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]] wants to find a cure for a disease known as the Gillen virus, a disease similar to, yet more deadly than, the "Fire Rising virus." She and a colleague capture infected mosquitoes and give them small doses of radiation. She explains that the levels have to be exact because if the mosquitoes receive too much radiation, the results could be more devastating than the virus itself.  A convict named Ray Erikson ([[Matt Jordan]]) joins Dr. Allen's program in exchange for his lifelong prison sentence. He takes a hostage and convinces Dr. Allen to open the door to the experiment room. The security guards open fire and cause an explosion that showers Ray and Dr. Allen with the chemicals and the genetically altered mosquitoes. Ray manages to flee the scene.  He begins to transform into the titular monster, a deformed chimera, half man, half mosquito, yet he manages to find his way to his ex-girlfriend's apartment, where the process continues. When the ex comes home, she finds it in ruins. She and Ray have a short, anxious conversation before Ray's transformation is complete and he kills her.  Meanwhile, Dr. Allen returns home with her boyfriend, Baltimore Police Lieutenant Tom Randall ([[Corin Nemec]]). That evening, she notices her wrist is red and raw-looking. She thinks little of it, but by the next morning, it has spread to her entire arm. Later, while kissing Tom, she has a sudden craving for blood and bites him. He is called to Ray's girlfriend's apartment and leaves. Dr. Allen rushes into the bathroom to find her arm bleeding. She convulses, falls to the floor and her skin starts to bubble.  Tom arrives at the crime scene and is puzzled by the way Ray's girlfriend died. He is called to investigate another crime scene, where he encounters Mansquito. The monster seems unstoppable, until Tom shocks him with a stun gun, making him flee in pain. Tom's partner doesn't believe him at first but puts a bulletin out on the creature.  At the research station, Dr. Allen discovers she is also changing into a human-mosquito hybrid, but more slowly as she received a smaller dose than Ray. Mansquito appears but doesn't try to kill her, and after she faints, the monster leaves. Tom takes her to the hospital.  The doctor wants to give Dr. Allen a blood transfusion to slow down the transformation, but she replies that nothing can stop the mutation. She believes the monster sensed that she is turning into a creature like him and that once the transformation is complete, he will want to mate with her. Outside, a guard falls victim to the monster and Tom leaves to investigate. Mansquito undergoes another transformation, this time growing wings.  Dr. Allen also undergoes another transformation and alerts the officers of Mansquito's arrival. They fail to stop him. The monster heads for Dr. Allen, but she manages to escape. Tom fires a rocket launcher at the oxygen tanks behind Mansquito and assumes the creature was killed by the explosion, but that is not the case.  Meanwhile, back at the lab, Dr. Allen undergoes yet another transformation and releases the last batch of genetically altered mosquitoes, which have been perfected. Tom arrives and Dr. Allen tells him that Mansquito is still alive. She tries to commit suicide by stabbing herself with a syringe, because without a mate, Mansquito will die.  The monster arrives and Tom fights him to no avail. Dr. Allen is seriously injured by Mansquito, who is now focused on killing her rather than mating with her. Tom uses the stun gun and once again, it works. Seeing this, Dr. Allen breaks an electrical line and electrocutes Mansquito, sacrificing herself. Tom writes a report about the incident and the Gillen virus is wiped out by the altered mosquitoes.

Marathon (2005 film)
 A young man with [[autism]], named Cho-won, finds release only in running. As a child, Cho-won regularly had meltdowns, bit himself, and struggled to communicate with othersâfinding solace only in [[zebra]]s and the Korean snack, [[choco pie]]. His mother never gave up on him and was determined to prove to the world that her child can achieve. As Cho-won gets older, he begins to find a passion for running and his mother is there to encourage and support him. Even though their family suffers from financial difficulties, they find a former marathon champion, Jung-wook â now a lethargic older man with an alcohol problem.  Jung-wook, who is serving community service hours as a physical education teacher for a [[DUI]], grudgingly accepts the offer to train Cho-won in marathon running, but eventually becomes lazy with him. The coach often takes Cho-won's snack, and takes Cho-won to a [[jjimjilbang]] to relax. Even though Jung-wook slacks off most of the time, Cho-won's determination for running is firm (he accidentally runs 100 laps around a soccer field when the coach told him to without literally meaning it).  He takes third place in a 10&nbsp;km running race, which causes his mother to set another goal for her son: to run a full [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] under three hours. This is not an easy task, however, as Cho-won wants to win but doesnât know how to pace himself. Therefore, his mother pleads the coach to run with Cho-won in order to teach him how to pace his running. The movie shows the emotional struggles of a mother who is not sure if she is forcing her son to run or if it truly is his passion.

The Matador

Julian is confronting the immorality of his profession and experiencing a mid-life crisis that causes him to freeze on a job; Danny is fearing that a vitally important deal will fall through and cost him his job.  After an uncomfortable-at-times conversation, Danny leaves the bar.  Julian apologizes and invites him to see a bullfight.  During the spectacle, Julian reveals the kind of work he truly does, and when Danny is skeptical, takes Danny through the steps of murdering a portly spectator in the arena bathroom.  Danny is shocked at how easily Julian can get within inches of the man, even though Julian ends the "tutorial" without going through with the murder.  Later, while at an outdoor cafe, Julian asks Danny to assist him in "facilitating a fatality"; Danny flatly refuses and Julian leaves. On leaving the idea seems to be that Julian has had enough of Danny and their friendship has just ended.  That evening Julian appears at Danny's hotel room, knocking on the door, pleading to be let in; Julian wants to apologize for attempting to involve Danny in his work.  Danny sits within looking undecided, and the scene fades to black without revealing what happened next. There is the sound of glass breaking once the screen goes dark.  The film picks up again six months later, during the Christmas season.  Danny and his wife, Bean ([[Hope Davis]]) are relaxing at their home when Julian arrives, looking for a place to stay. Danny and Bean have reservations about the situation, but decide to let him in. The grateful Julian notices that Danny has framed the ticket from the bullfight, an act that affects Julian profoundly. That night, he shares the real reason for his visit: he needs help with one last job.  Julian convinces Danny to go along with the plan because, he tells Danny, "you owe me." After much internal struggle and with Danny talking him through it, Julian completes the task at a Tucson horse race track.  On the plane back from Tucson, Julian reveals that the man he just killed was his boss. Killing the boss means now Julian can retire and spend the rest of his life in Greece.  Danny is surprised, then amused at Julian's craftiness, but is reminded of Julian's lethal personality when he lightly punches Julian in the shoulder and is sternly warned by Julian, "Don't ever hit me again."  Danny remembers his friend is still a killer and immediately apologizes. A split flashback sequence during the flight home (memories triggered by a statement Danny makes), shows what took place a year prior when Danny let Julian into his hotel room: Julian talked Danny out of commissioning a hit on a rival to win the Mexico City business deal.  Later, Danny and Bean are shown visiting the grave of their son, something they do together every year.  Julian watches respectfully from a distance, places plane tickets for Greece (his intended place of retirement) on their car windshield, then slips away.

During a storm, after having her choice of profession attacked by Eleanor, Nola leaves the house to be alone.

At the police station, Chris lies about his relationship with Nola, but Banner surprises him with her diary, in which he is featured extensively.

One night Chris sees apparitions of Nola and Mrs. Eastby, who tell him to be ready for the consequences of his actions. He replies that his crimes, though wrong, had been "necessary", and that he is able to suppress his guilt. At the same time, Banner dreams that Chris committed the murders. His theory is discredited by his partner, Dowd, who informs him that a drug peddler found murdered on the streets had Mrs. Eastby's ring in his pocket. Banner and Dowd consider the case closed and abandon any further investigation. Chloe gives birth to a baby boy named Terrence, and his uncle blesses him not with greatness but with luck.

The plots come together in the end, with Peter developing a friendship with the daughter of a neighbor, having been introduced to the [[hope chest]] that she has, Christine and Richard displaying a show of mutual acceptance of their attraction to each other, and, as a final plot device, Robby finding that the noise he had awoken to early every morning was that of an early-rising businessman tapping a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] on a street sign pole. When asked why he is doing it, he stops and turns around, saying "just passing the time", and gives Robby the quarter. When his bus drives away and Robby tries it out himself, the sun heightens with each tap, time literally passing as he does it.

He has a pretty wife named Alina ([[Hilda van der Meulen]]), a son named Vanya ([[Naum Shopov]]), and a successful profession as an automobile mechanic. But one day, Russian mob boss Aleksandr Sasha Popov ([[Ivan Petrushinov]]) and his gang come to town.  Caught in the crossfire is Nick's family. When the smoke clears, Alina and Vanya lie dead in the streets. Nick arms himself and tracks down Sasha and his gang, cornering them in a drug deal and laying waste.  Years later, Nick emigrates to the U.S. and takes a job as a car mechanic in [[Los Angeles]]. And then wealthy Mary Abramoff ([[Levana Finkelstein]]) tracks him down. She pleads with him to go to Russia and retrieve her daughter Julia ([[Olivia Lee]]), who has been kidnapped and forced into the sex trade.  Mary knows Nick's past and, though he is initially reluctant, when she shows him a picture of the kidnapper, he changes his mind: it is Sasha Popov, somehow alive after Nick shot him in the face years ago.  Nick takes the next plane to [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]], and he joins up with a band of mercenaries led by British mercenary William Burton ([[Ben Cross]]). Their mission is clear: free Julia from Sasha, and mow down anyone who stands in their way.  
Memoirs of a Geisha (film)
  Chiyo Sakamoto ([[Suzuka Ohgo]]), a young girl from a poverty stricken fishing village, is sold along with her older sister Satsu ([[Samantha Futerman]]) into a life of servitude by her aging father. Chiyo is taken in by Mrs. Kayoko Nitta ([[Kaori Momoi]]), the Mother (proprietress) of a geisha house in [[Gion]], [[Hanamachi|one of the most prominent geisha districts]] in Kyoto, whereas Satsu is sold to a [[prostitution]] brothel.  At the [[okiya]], Chiyo meets another young girl named Pumpkin ([[Youki Kudoh]]), the cranky Granny (Kotoko Kawamura), and the okiya's only working geisha, Hatsumomo ([[Gong Li]]) who is famous for her breathtaking beauty. Chiyo soon discovers Hatsumomo is secretly a cruel and jealous woman that views Chiyo as a potential rival due to her striking bluish-gray eyes, along with being a change in Mother's future financial dependence. Hatsumomo then goes out of her way to deliberately make Chiyo's new life miserable by having her take the blame for everything and intentionally withholding information of her sister's whereabouts in the pleasure district. However, Auntie ([[Tsai Chin (actress)|Tsai Chin]]) is aware of this and warns Chiyo against trusting and angering Hatsumomo, given her history with the ill-mannered geisha.  Chiyo tracks down Satsu and makes plans to run away together. However, upon returning to the okiya she discovers Hatsumomo with her boyfriend, Koichi ([[Karl Yune]]), which is against the rules of the Geisha lifestyle. When they are caught, Hatsumomo attempts to twist the situation by accusing Chiyo of stealing. Chiyo denies this and informs Mother of what she saw in the shed. As a result, everyone is barred from leaving the okiya at night except to attend work engagements, and this further increases Hatsumomo's anger towards Chiyo. On the night of their planned escape, Chiyo attempts to sneak out but falls off the rooftop and is seriously injured. As punishment for dishonoring the okiya, Mother tells Chiyo that she won't invest any more money in her geisha training. She also informs Chiyo that both her parents ([[Mako Iwamatsu|Mako]] and [[Elizabeth Sung]]) are dead. Chiyo misses her chance to flee and never sees Satsu again. She is also demoted from geisha training to working as a slave to pay off her increasing debts to Mother.  One day, while crying on a riverbank, Chiyo is noticed by the Chairman ([[Ken Watanabe]]) and his geisha companions. He buys her a shaved ice dessert and gives her his handkerchief with some money in it. Inspired by his act of kindness, Chiyo resolves to become a geisha so that she may one day become a part of the Chairman's life.  Several years later, Pumpkin ([[Youki Kudoh]]) has begun her training as a [[Maiko (geiko)|maiko]] under Hatsumomo's tutelage and Chiyo ([[Zhang Ziyi|Ziyi Zhang]]) is envious of it as she remains a maid under Mother. She is unexpectedly taken under the wing of Mameha ([[Michelle Yeoh]]), one of Gion's most successful geisha and long time rival of Hatsumomo's. Although initially reluctant, Mother is persuaded by Mameha to allow Chiyo to train as a geisha.  Under Mameha's tutelage, Chiyo becomes a maiko and takes the name of Sayuri. She grows in popularity, and Hatsumomo grows so desperate that she tries to ruin Sayuri's reputation. Predicting this, Mameha takes her to a sumo wrestling match where Sayuri is reintroduced to the Chairman, who seems unaware of her previous identity as Chiyo, as well as his business associate Nobu Toshikazu ([[KÅji Yakusho]]) (whom Hatsumomo finds repulsive), who takes a liking to her.  Meanwhile, Mameha orchestrates a bidding war for Sayuri's [[mizuage]] between two men: Nobu and Dr. Crab ([[Randall Duk Kim]]), which will make her a full geisha. Upon learning what Mameha has planned, Hatsumomo spreads cruel rumors that Sayuri has already lost her virginity. However, Sayuri is named the lead dancer for a popular performance, which angers Hatsumomo as she was hoping for Pumpkin to be named the lead. At the performance, she attracts the attention of many men, including the Baron ([[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]]) (Mameha's [[Geisha#Personal relationships and danna|danna]]), with her performance. When Dr. Crab congratulates Sayuri, she secretly convinces him to listen to a different opinion before taking the word of someone who lies.  The Baron invites Sayuri to his estate for a sakura-viewing party, which Mameha is reluctant to let Sayuri attend but lets her go anyway. When the Baron presents a kimono to Sayuri in private at the party, he undresses her against her will in order to "take a look", but does not go any further.  Sayuri's mizuage is won with a record-breaking bid of fifteen thousand yen. Mother, seeing Sayuri as a financial asset, names her as her adopted daughter and heiress to the okiya. This crushes Pumpkin, who was hoping that she would get adopted so she could have security in her old age, and enrages Hatsumomo. She is then told by Mother that she must give up her spacious room to Sayuri, which further outrages Hatsumomo, who tries to remind her of her previous financial contribution. Mameha later tells Sayuri that the bid had ended up a contest between Dr. Crab and the Baron, Nobu having refused to partake in the bidding because it was against his principles. Mameha let it go to Dr. Crab because of her romantic feelings for the Baron, despite his bid being even higher. When returning home from the mizuage ceremony, Sayuri finds a drunken Hatsumomo in her room, where she has found the Chairman's handkerchief. A fight ensues, during which a gas lantern is knocked over and ignites a fire, and the okiya is partially destroyed by the flames. Hatsumomo is then kicked out of the okiya by Mother, her belongings given to Sayuri, and she is banished from Gion with her fate left unknown.  Sayuri's successful career is cut short by the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Sayuri and Mameha are separated, with Sayuri going to the hills to work for a kimono maker, an old friend of Nobu's, and Mameha going to a physician, the Chairman's old friend. After the war, Sayuri is reunited with Nobu, who needs her help with impressing an American Colonel named Derricks ([[Ted Levine]]) who has the power to approve funding for the Chairman's firm. Sayuri reunites with Mameha, who now makes a living renting rooms for the poor. Although she is reluctant to return to the geisha lifestyle after what she's been through, she agrees to help impress Derricks. Sayuri is reacquainted with Pumpkin, who is now a flirty escort. Sayuri goes on a trip with Nobu, the Chairman, Mameha, Pumpkin, and the Americans to the Amami Islands.  At Amami, the Colonel propositions Sayuri, but is rejected. Nobu witnesses the incident and confronts Sayuri. He finally confesses his feelings, telling her that he wants to become her danna. Knowing that entering into a relationship with Nobu will destroy any chance of her being with the Chairman, Sayuri is distraught and devises a plan. Mameha catches on to it and warns her against it because of the kindness Nobu has shown her. She wants Sayuri to accept him as her danna and not end up like Hatsumomo did. She refuses and enlists Pumpkin's help to have Nobu catch her seemingly being intimate with the Colonel. However, because of her secret resentment of Sayuri, Pumpkin brings the Chairman instead, having full knowledge of Sayuri's feelings towards him. When Sayuri confronts her, Pumpkin coldly tells her that she did a lot of favors for her in the past and she stole her chances of being adopted by Mother. She hoped by having the Chairman see her with Derricks, he would be disgusted by Sayuri's behavior and she would have to accept Nobu as her danna.  A few days later, after returning to [[Gion]], Sayuri receives a call to go to the teahouse. Sayuri expects to see Nobu, but instead the Chairman comes and finally reveals to her that he has known all along that she was the girl at the riverbank. He tells her that he had told Nobu about the affair after confronting Pumpkin for her behavior, effectively destroying Nobu's affections for Sayuri and his desire to be her danna. He also reveals that he was responsible for sending Mameha to her so that she could fulfill her dreams of becoming a [[geisha]]. Sayuri finally reveals her love to the Chairman, and the film ends with their loving embrace and kiss, and a stroll through the garden.

  A United States oil company loses a drill, intended to do work in the Arctic, while flying over a Canadian lake. Company employee Sean is contacted to go to Canada to find it; however, he has to cancel plans to take his son to [[Walt Disney World]]. Although his son, Mac, is disappointed, he agrees to go with his father to Canada. Once in Canada, they meet a local native named Custer who helps Sean and another employee on their mission.   They visit the lake using a submarine, and after taking pictures of the bottom of the lake discover incredibly deep giant rivers. The legend of Mee-Shee states that the rivers lead to the ocean. Sean and Mac rent the home of Mrs. Coogan, a kindly lady whom Sean refers to as "[[Mary Poppins]]".   Mac, Sean and others see vague images of [[Mee-Shee]] that spark their curiosity. Upon meeting Custer's daughter Pawnee, Mac goes with her to a cave where local native woman "Crazy Norma" feeds Mee-Shee. This is where they first meet the unique creature. Mac runs back to the house to tell his dad, but Mrs. Coogan warns that Mee-Shee's life could be endangered if the outside world knew of it.   Meanwhile, saboteurs Snead and Watkins, agents of a rival oil company who pose as Greenpeace representatives, destroy Sean's equipment and search for the drill themselves. Their first time under the water, they see Mee-Shee and shoot him with a harpoon. When Mac finds him again in the cave he removes the harpoon, and tells environmental ranger Laura about it. Events lead to a search for Mee-Shee and conflicts with the saboteurs. The saboteurs capture Mee-Shee and attempt to kill him, but an even larger Mee-Shee appears, meaning that the one in the net is a baby and the larger one is an adult. Enraged, the mother attacks the saboteurs and kills them. Out of gratitude, the baby Mee-Shee retrieves the drill but they decide that they don't want it and throw it back. All of a sudden 8 more Mee-Shees appear out of the water, both old and young (showing that there's more than one).

She has a close relationship with her grandmother, but feels increasingly distant from her mother. On a summer afternoon, Melissa and her best friend Manuela attend a pool party at the home of Daniele, a wealthy, attractive boy from school, on whom Melissa has long had a crush. Daniele takes Melissa to a secluded spot, where they talk for a while before he has her perform oral sex on him. Despite the less-than-romantic encounter, Melissa's feelings for Daniele only intensify.  After failed attempts to get Daniele's attention, Melissa goes to a bar where he is hanging out with his friends. Daniele then takes Melissa to his place and she loses her virginity to him. She tells him she loves him, but he coldly rejects her. Humiliated, Melissa vows to never let anyone hurt her again and to only think of her own pleasure.

Men Heroes and Gay Nazis
 During a gay march in [[Berlin]], some of the men in the crowd are asked their opinion about gay men who have extreme right-wing views or who are [[white power skinheads]] or [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]]. All of those questioned express their disapproval. One of them comments the absurdity of the situation: if the gay right-wing and neo-Nazis would have lived in the era they admire, they would have been exterminated.  Four gay men in present-day Germany who are, or have been, engaged in right-wing political parties are interviewed: Andre, a skinhead; [[Bela Ewald Althans]], a former prominent neo-Nazi leader; Alexander Schlesinger, who is involved in right wing politics and JÃ¶rg Fischer, a right wing theorist.  Andre is a skinhead who defines violence as to have the courage to defend himself and as part of the expression of the warrior within. Openly gay he is tolerated by his fellow skinheads but admits that he is in constant threat. Eventually, he moves away from the skinheads movement to conservative politics.  [[Bela Ewald Althans]], who now works in advertising, was in the early 1990s one of Germany most prominent neo-Nazi, an [[Adolf Hitler]] admirer and [[Holocaust denial|holocaust denier]]. In 1994, he was arrested and spent 21 months in jail for denying the holocaust in front of astonished tourists during a visit to [[Dachau concentration camp]] while he was filmed in ''Profesion: Neonazi'' ''(Beruf Neonazi)'', a documentary about him. Althans is now involved in the gay community, but he does not regret his past. He tells that he did not become gay from one day to the other, but evolved in his feelings and attractions until he discovered his true self.  Alexander Schlesinger, who came from [[East Germany]], is a member of a political party representing extreme right-wing views. Schlesinger claims that being gay does not make a person better, a gay can be racist. About what he finds appealing, he comments: "We gay men are drawn toward a masculine ideal. I can't stand a screaming queen".  For nine years, JÃ¶rg Fischer was an active member of the extreme right-wing parties NPD and DVU. During that time he had a relationship with another male party member. Although they had sex many times a week for four years, they never talked about sex or mention the word gay. Fischer left those organizations in 1991 rejecting their anti-immigrant and anti- gay policies. He found a different romantic male partner and now works in social issues.  The testimonies of the four men are intertwined with interviews by historians, journalists and intellectuals who have followed the links between fascism and homosexuality through recent German history. The life of famed neo-Nazi [[Michael Kuhnen]] is recounted. Considered the [[FÃ¼hrer]] by his followers, he kept his homosexuality secret until 1981 when Johannes Bugner, a young gay neo-Nazi, was stabbed to death in [[Hamburg]] for his sexual orientation. Kuhnen disengaged himself from the killers, considering Bugner a martyr of the movement and came out as gay in his booklet ''National Socialism and homosexuality'' writing that gay men make better fighters, because, having no family, they are closer to their comrades. Kuhnen, ostracized by his former supporters, died of [[AIDS]] in 1991.  There have always been extreme right-wing homosexuals, the documentary explains, even in [[Nazi Germany]]. [[Rudolf Hess]] had no interest in women, wrote love letters and poems to men in his youth and married only on Hitler's advise. [[Ernst RÃ¶hm]], co-founder of the Sturmabteilung (SA, "Storm Battalion"), the Nazi Party militia, was a close friend of Hitler since 1919 being the only one who call him Adolph and was allowed to address him with familiarity. Hitler knew about RÃ¶hm's homosexuality and particular weakness for young soldiers but turned a blind eye as he counted on RÃ¶hm's violent trooper paramilitary Brownshirts during his ascending to power. During the purge of the Nazi party known as [[Night of the Long Knives (1934)]] Hitler had RÃ¶hm arrested and killed shortly after in prison. [[Edmund Heines]], RÃ¶hmâs deputy in the SA, was another gay Nazi leader. He set-up his own special concentration camp near [[Breslau]] so he could torture and kill victims for pleasure. Theories on Adolf Hitlerâs own sexuality are also briefly examined. [[Lothar Machtan]] in his book ''Hitler's Secret: The double life of a dictator'' ''(Hitlers Geheimnis: Das Doppelleben eines Diktators)'' questions Hitler's sexuality.  During the Nazi regime between 5 and 15 thousand gay men were killed in concentration camps. [[Pierre Seel]], a gay Holocaust survivor, appears briefly recounting how a young friend was eaten alive by the dogs of Schirmeck-Vorbruck concentration camp .

As they try to perform for Helena, a shadow encroaches on the area and two of the performers are consumed by it. The third performer, Valentine ([[Jason Barry]]), a juggler, helps to quickly direct Helena to safety through the use of magical flying books. She learns they are in the City of Light which is slowly being consumed by shadows, causing its widely varied citizens to flee. Soon Helena is mistaken for the Princess. She and Valentine are taken to the Prime Minister (Brydon). He explains that the Princess from the Land of Shadow stole a charm from the City of Light, leaving their White Queen (McKee) in a state of unnatural sleep and the City vulnerable to the Shadows. Helena notes the resemblance of the Queen and Minister to her mother and father, and offers to help recover the charm along with Valentine. They are unaware their actions are being watched by the Queen of Shadows (also McKee) who has mistaken Helena as the Princess of the Land of Shadows.  Helena and Valentine attempt to stay ahead of the shadows as they follow clues to the charm, learning that it is called the "MirrorMask". Helena discovers that by looking through the windows of the buildings, she can see into her bedroom in the real world, through the drawings of windows that she created and hung on the wall of her room. She discovers that a [[doppelgÃ¤nger]] of herself is living there and behaving radically different from her. The doppelganger soon becomes aware of her presence in the drawings and begins to destroy them, causing parts of the fantasy world to collapse.

The Princess takes the drawings to the building's roof to disperse the shreds into the wind, but discovers one more drawing Helena had made on the back of the roof door. Helena successfully returns to the real world, sending the Princess back to her realm. At the same time, the White Queen finally awakens and the two Cities are restored to their natural balance.

The dialogue begins at a wedding reception at the table of three mobsters.  Carmine Pasquale (Mark DeCarlo) is complaining about the taste of the coffee.  We find out later that Carmine has the nickname of "The Beans" because he orders a very special type of coffee bean that he grinds himself.

They then get their new identities in the Witness Protection Program as George, Linda and Patrick Cheeseman to [[Happy Valley (Utah County)|Happy Valley, Utah]].  Meanwhile, in the neighborhood in to which the Cheesemans will be moving, the bishop of the local ward has to leave the church meeting because he was paged with a family emergency.  His first counselor, Brother Jaymes, is left in charge of the meeting.  By the time that the Jaymes family arrives at home, we find out that the bishop's father has died and the bishop will be in a distant community for a few weeks taking care of the funeral and deciding (with the rest of his family) on the disposition of the family farm.  What follows is culture shock, on both sides.  When the neighborhood men attempt to help them move in, George (Carmine) thinks they're stealing their stuff so he punches one of them in the face.  The next to visit the Cheesemans is the neighborhood [[gossip|busybody]], who is on the phone the minute she leaves their house and turns most of the neighborhood (all Mormons) against the Cheesemans ([[Catholic]]s).  The next to visit is the Jaymes family, who befriends the Cheeseman family, inviting them to participate in ward activities.  Throughout the film, the Jaymes family does manage to get a few more of the neighbors to befriend the Cheeseman family.  The members of the Cheeseman family also becomes closer to each other, and begin attending the local Catholic church as a family.  But the mobsters have recently hired an [[Information technology|IT]] guy.  He has found that since Carmine's disappearance, there has only been one new home address ordering the special beans that Carmine likes.  A team of two is sent to take care of Carmine.  When they show up to verify that Carmine lives at the address, Carmine spots them and takes off on foot.  There is a short car chase that ends with the FBI capturing the mobsters.  The FBI uses an insider to leak that the team was captured before Carmine found out about them, knowing that another team will be sent.  After leaving a dinner at the local [[ward (LDS Church)|ward]], the Cheesemans get in their van and it blows up.  The next Sunday, it is revealed that the ward [[bishop (Mormonism)|bishop]] is going to move to take care of his recently [[widow]]ed mother and the family farm.  Michael Jaymes is called by the [[stake (Mormonism)|stake president]] to become the next bishop of this ward.  About half of the ward members vote against supporting Michael Jaymes as bishop.  The stake president calls a special meeting of the ward (without the Jaymes family present) to find out why they will not support Jaymes as bishop.  George (Carmine), having found out about them not supporting Jaymes, shows up at the meeting to speak on behalf of Michael Jaymes.  Since he has revealed that he is alive, he and his family also go to visit the Jaymes family.  The stake president stops by later and tells Michael Jaymes that he will be the bishop.  The movie's final scene takes place six months later, in a [[scrapbooking]] store at an "undisclosed location".  Scrapbooking was so popular in Utah that Donald and May Clayton ([[pseudonym|aka]] Cheeseman, aka Pasquale) family have opened a scrapbooking store and run it along with their son Jordan.  The Mormon missionaries are buying a book in the store, and Donald tells them that it is "on the house".  Donald also invites them over for dinner, but no message.  The movie ends with Donald telling the missionaries about his wife's cooking.  
The Mistress of Spices
 Tilo ([[Aishwarya Rai]]), an immigrant from India, is a shopkeeper, an unusually strong [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]], and a chosen Mistress of Spices.  The Spices she gives to her customers help them to satisfy their certain needs and desires, such as  "sandalwood to dispel painful memories; black cumin seed to protect against evil eye."  As a young girl, Tilo was initiated as one of several young Mistresses of Spices by the First Mother ([[Zohra Sehgal]]), who warns the girls about certain rules they must follow, or face dire consequences. They are instructed never to leave their respective stores all around the world, physically touch the skin of the people they meet, or use the great and incomprehensible strength and power of the Spices to their own ends.  Tilo ends up in the San Francisco Bay Area in a store called "Spice Bazaar". Tilo's customers include Haroun, a cab driver ([[Nitin Ganatra]]), a grandfather ([[Anupam Kher]]) dealing with an American-born granddaughter Geeta ([[Padma Lakshmi]]), Kwesi, a man trying to impress his girlfriend ([[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]]) and Jagjit, a teenager trying to fit in at school (Sonny Gill Dulay).  Her life takes a turn one day, when a young architect named Doug ([[Dylan McDermott]]) crashes his motorcycle outside her store. Tilo tends to his injuries while trying to ignore their mutual romantic attraction. Her life changes when he touches her and they begin to fall in love.  But the Spices are displeased, and things soon start to go sour in her relationships with her other customers. Haroun gets in an accident, Geeta's family situation does not improve, Jagjit falls in with the wrong crowd at school, and Kwesi's girlfriend breaks up with him. Doug comes to meet her that night and sadly tells her that his Native American-born mother had died.  Tilo recognizes that the source of these misfortunes is due to her breaking the rules fit for a Mistress. The First Mother comes to her in a vision and scolds her for choosing Doug over the Spices. She vows that she will return to India, and posts a notice about a closing sale. She goes all out to help her customers one last time and tells the Spices that she will spend just one night with Doug, and then she will give herself utterly to them. She closes the store and goes off with Doug for the night. After a night of love-making, she leaves him a note that she must leave and cannot return, but that she will always deeply love him. Then she goes back to the store and sets the Spices on fire, with her at the center of the flames, as a sign of eternal servitude to the mystical Spices.  Doug comes searching for her, and finds the store devastated. But Tilo has not been burned after all; she is still there, alive and barely conscious. There is no sign of a fire, but there has been an earthquake. We see a vision of the First Mother sitting at the beach, telling her that because she demonstrated her willingness to give up everything for the Spices, now she can have everything she desires and the Spices will never desert her again. Doug agrees to help her rebuild the store, and she happily reunites with him as they walk along the beach holding hands.

Mob Sister
 In the macho [[Triad (underground societies)|triad]] world where heroes are molded from blood, brawn and brains, what place is there for a defenseless girl? The only exception to the rule is if you earn your respect as 'Ah Sou' - the big boss' wife. Ah Sou tells the extraordinary story of an innocent girl who becomes appointed successor to Hong Kong's ruling triad. This role becomes a double-edged sword for our young heroine, who is sucked into a maelstrom of vicious gang wars, hair-raising assassination attempts and ruthless power struggles and betrayals. Through numerous violent episodes and unexpected reversals, she discovers her own inner strength and re-writes the laws of the triad kingdom.  
Mithayi Mane
 ''Mithai Mane'' is the story of an 11-year-old girl named Ganga, who leaves from a poor village to work as a maid for a well-off family in the city. Her situation is compared throughout the movie to the plight of Gretel (held prisoner in the witch's cottage), and her story is interwoven with a voice-over narration of the Hansel and Gretel story. One of Ganga's tasks is to bring the household children's lunch boxes to their private school. At the school she is befriended by Swathi, a schoolgirl who wants to help her. As their friendship grows, Ganga becomes more aware of her surroundings. Child labor is at the heart of this film, but it is treated with gentle irony and there is no assignment of blame. The well-to-do family is self-absorbed and insensitive, not cruel and exploitative. The audience, however, has seen the plight of the villagers and the contrast with the opulence of the city-dwellers is obvious. The most powerful image is the open-eyed and honesty that Ganga brings with her from the village. These qualities will eventually force her to leave the sugar-coated house in the city where everything is a little too sweet.<ref>[http://www.miff.org/fireflies2007.shtml http://www.miff.org/fireflies2007.shtml]  Maine International Film Festival 2008.

La Moustache
 ''La Moustache'' opens with Marc Thiriez, a middle aged Parisian, taking a bath and asking his wife if he should shave off the [[moustache]] he has sported for most of his adult life. His wife, AgnÃ¨s, wryly comments that she wouldn't recognize him without it, yet as she leaves, Marc shaves the moustache off. Upon her return, AgnÃ¨s is angry Marc did not let her in the door when she rang. Marc lies and says he broke his shoelace. In the car Marc asks his wife if she notices anything. She does not respond, wanting to know if he thinks she is dressed too sexy for the party. Later that evening, as the two visit their friends Serge (Agnes' first husband) and Nadia, Serge tells a funny story from his marriage to AgnÃ¨s, how she was sneaky and refused to admit it, even when found out. AgnÃ¨s again denies the sneakiness. Frustrated that Serge and Nadia also do not notice that Marc has shaven his trademark moustache, Marc fights with AgnÃ¨s in the car as they return home, frightening AgnÃ¨s. As they lie in bed that night, another fight over the moustache ensues as AgnÃ¨s digs in her heels and tells Marc he's never had a moustache and that she fears for his sanity. AgnÃ¨s phones Nadia and Nadia claims Marc has not had a moustache in fifteen years. AgnÃ¨s takes a sleeping pill to sleep.  Marc finds a photo album of pictures from their holiday in [[Bali]], all of which show him sporting his moustache. When he confronts AgnÃ¨s with these pictures, she ignores him and changes the subject, leaving him even more confused. She suggests Marc see a psychiatrist whom her friend FranÃ§ois knew. Marc tries to make the best of his situation, but grows more paranoid and confused when even his co-workers don't acknowledge that he has shaven his moustache. He smokes a cigarette and his co-worker tells him he is fool for starting up again.  His wife is upset at the soccer team and yells at the TV. She is upset when she finds Marc has taken up smoking again. They go out and AgnÃ¨s insists on buying Marc a brightly patterned jacket ("a clown's jacket" as Marc describes it). AgnÃ¨s orders a cigarette at dinner, saying they will quit together again later, and cries as she smokes and drinks.  As Marc gets his photograph taken for his work badge, he asks a woman who is also getting her photograph taken if she notices a difference between the photograph that was just taken and his photograph which appears on his I.D. card. She says the moustache is different, and Marc asks her several times if she is sure he has a moustache in the photograph. She confirms this, which leaves Marc more baffled. He returns home early from work.  Marc checks his answering machine to find a message from his father. AgnÃ¨s' friend Bruno calls and Marc tells him to stop kidding him about his moustache. Bruno assures Marc that Marc has not had a moustache in fifteen years. Marc hangs up on him. In the kitchen, he tells AgnÃ¨s to call his parents and tell them that he won't be able to come to their house for dinner the next day. AgnÃ¨s calls Marc's mother, but gently reminds Marc that his father is dead and has been so for a year. Confused, Marc speaks of their best friends Serge and Nadia, to which AgnÃ¨s replies that she doesn't know who they are and that Marc must be delusional. Very upset and slowly losing his grip on sanity, Marc goes to bed, and AgnÃ¨s gives him a sleeping pill.  Marc awakes to hear AgnÃ¨s and Bruno planning to have Marc committed to a psychiatric hospital. Marc quickly dresses and flees the house. In a taxi, he attempts to find his mother, yet due to the sleeping pill and the heavy rain, he cannot find the house in which he grew up. Marc tries to call his mother, but the number he dials is not a valid phone number.  He calls AgnÃ¨s, tells her he is at his mother's, and asks her to pick him up. When Marc sees AgnÃ¨s and Bruno leave his apartment to pick Marc up, he rushes inside, grabs his passport, puts on shoes, breaks his shoelace and leaves. He flees to Hong Kong, the first available flight out of Paris. His passport photo sports a moustache.  Marc journeys through Hong Kong, traveling back and forth on the [[Star Ferry]] all day. After the ferry stops for the night, he pays local sailors to take him with them on their boat. They agree, and Marc arrives at an unspecified village in China (filmed in [[Ko Lau Wan]], [[Sai Kung Peninsula]], Hong Kong). Marc stays at a hotel there for a period of time, becoming known with the locals, and regrows his signature moustache.  Marc arrives back at the hotel to find AgnÃ¨s awaiting him, as though she has been with him the entire trip. AgnÃ¨s makes fun of his brightly patterned jacket and asks him why he bought it, hoping he will not wear it in Paris. They go out to a casino and meet new friends that AgnÃ¨s knows but Marc does not. The male half of the couple shows him recent photos of the four of them in which Marc has a moustache. Marc has no memory of the event, but the pictures are whisked away before he can examine them closely. AgnÃ¨s notices Marc's irritation and says if he doesn't like their new friends they don't have to ever see them again when they get back to Paris.  In an ambiguous ending, AgnÃ¨s suggests that Marc shave his moustache so she can see him without it at least once. He does so, and AgnÃ¨s comments upon how good he looks without it. Whether this final scene was meant to be what really happened or was just an idealised dream of what Marc wished had happened is unspecified.  
Mother of Mine (film)
 The story is a discussion between Eero and his biological mother (Kirsti), where they are talking to each other and clarifying their misunderstanding and difference in present time. Eero has just come back from his visit from Sweden for Signe's (Swedish mother) funeral.  The plot of the story is based on the time of the Second World War and the main character of the story is a Finnish boy (Eero Lahti).  The biological father of Eero (Kari-Pekka Toivonen) is in the Finnish army. He dies in the front and Eero's  mother Kirsti falls into deep depression. As the war gets worse, Eero is sent to Sweden to a new Swedish family. In the new family, he has a father Hjalmar JÃ¶nsson, mother Signe JÃ¶nsson and a grandfather (who cannot speak but hears everything). He also meets the neighborâs daughter Siv.   Despite Hjalmar being very welcoming, Eero is not willing to stay in Sweden and wants to go back to his biological mother. Signe is frustrated in Eero's unwillingness to adjust to the situation. She is also frustrated in the language barrier and the fact that she wanted to have a small girl instead of Eero. There is a reason why she wished to have a girl; it is later revealed that she had lost her six-year-old daughter Elin two years earlier in a drowning accident.  In the struggle of the change Signe wants the boy to learn Swedish.  After a long struggle to adjust, slowly Signe starts to attach to the boy and she starts loving him. And getting attention, care and affection, the boy starts attaching too, and that leads to their having a tight mother-son relationship.  The war ends and Germany loses the war with Russia. The children taken to Sweden safe from the war are now being returned to their homes in Finland.  The situation in Finland (Helsinki) gets better, and that means Eero has to return to his biological mother and leave the JÃ¶nsson family in Sweden. The bond between his Swedish family has by then grown so much stronger that he is unwilling to go back to Helsinki. But despite of his wishes and Signe's resistance, Eero is sent back to Finland to his mother Kirsti.  Later, in a scene where Eero and his mother are older, Eero tells his mother that back then, it was impossible to ever have the same relationship with his biological mother that they used to. As a child, he was certain that once he lets someone come close to him, he is in risk of losing everything again. Eero was afraid that her mother will leave him again if things get worse. The adult Eero even tells his mother, that when he came back from SkÃ¥ne, Kirsti (his biological mother) wasn't a mother to him anymore.

Jonathan goes to the local diner where he meets Cal and his two girlfriends, Tina and Sara. Cal tells Jonathan about the legend of Bobby Fowler, an abused and deformed boy who lived in the mortuary. Jonathan also meets Liz, a local girl; Grady, Liz's best friend; and Rita, Liz's aunt, who employed her to work at the diner. Jonathan, Liz, and Grady become friends quickly. That night, Cal, Sara and Tina go to the graveyard outside the mortuary and vandalize it; they then go into one of the crypts, where they are attacked by Bobby Fowler.  The next day, Jonathan, Liz and Grady go back to Jonathan's house, where Grady gives them drugs. Shortly afterwards, Sheriff Howell shows up to welcome Leslie to the town. He informs her about his attempt to stop "graveyard babies". He also is looking for Cal, Sara, and Tina. Sheriff Howell investigates the crypts, where Bobby Fowler infects him. The next day at the diner, Jonathan and Liz are working, when Cal and Sara arrive messy. Cal has a rage attack and Sara begins vomiting black ooze. Rita comes in to calm her down but is infected in the process. At the mortuary, Leslie performs her first [[embalming]]. While doing so, she  makes a mess of the embalming fluids. While going to clean it up, one of the bodies gets up and infects Leslie. Jonathan, Jamie, Liz, and Grady return to Jonathan's house for dinner, where Leslie, now infected with the mysterious ooze, has prepared a sort of ooze soup. The four notice a black fungus growing on the wall. Liz pours salt in her soup which makes it bubble and sends Leslie into a rage in which she attacks Jonathan and Jamie. Liz and Grady quickly escape.  Shortly afterwards, Jonathan fights off his mother and saves Jamie. The four escape outside but are forced to retreat into a crypt, because they are chased there by an infected man. The four make the shocking discovery that Bobby lives in the crypt and dug tunnels under the cemetery. They find Tina, who is still alive, but are attacked by the mother. They find a ladder which leads back into the house, where they barricade themselves. They question Tina and eventually cut her hand to see if her blood has turned into the black ooze, a sign of the infection. Sheriff Howell assaults the house a shotgun. Tina goes into the kitchen to clean the wound but is infected by contaminated water. Grady accidentally pours salt on her, burning her. The group now knows the weakness of the infected, but their victory is short-lived after they find that Jamie, who Jonathan had left in her room to keep her safe, has been captured.  Shortly after entering the tunnels, they  see and hear things; a hand suddenly punches through Grady's chest, giving him enough time to say quietly, "run", before dying. They soon find the source, a well filled with black ooze. Shortly thereafter, Jamie is found, but captured by Bobby Fowler and taken back to the lair, where they confront him by throwing salt in the well. Cal is killed by getting his head blown off by the Sheriff, and the other infected are burned with salt; Bobby is sucked in and the three escape the house. The three, happy to escape but still grieving the deaths of Leslie and Grady, are about to leave the house, but Jonathan is pulled underground, and Leslie, alive again, pulls Jamie into the house, and Liz's fate is left untold.

Tensions arise between them and Sherry gets out of the car and back to the S*P*A*R*K group, where several of the female and male members have shaved their heads and have new rules such as no sex or alcohol.  Her mother soon finds her and she is initiated into the group after selling her house in Lisbon and donating the proceedings to  S*P*A*R*K, and she too has her head shaved. After getting half her hair shaved off, Sherry feels that she's unwanted there by Harry and tells him about it. He then kisses her and they have sex, but abandons her and then tells everyone, blaming it on her in the process. The rest of her hair is shaved and Sherry begins to see that Harry is psychologically abusing the rest of the members as well, slowly revealing himself to be a [[dictator]].  After Nancy propositions Sherry to run away to Lisbon, Harry quickly suspects that someone betrayed his trust by planning to leave. In a ring of members, he calls out the perpetrator and Nancy steps forward. She says 'We only wanted to have some fun', accidentally implicating someone else. Harry thinks that Ax is the second person, but Sherry steps forward and tells everyone that it was her idea, along with that whatever good was in the group is now gone. Harry throws Sherry and Nancy into a well known as 'the hole' and urinates on them once everyone had been shepherded into a barn. Nancy tearfully confesses to Sherry that she had sex with Harry and that he was always in her head afterwards. She begins to have a panic attack which triggers her asthma and Sherry screams for help, but everyone ignores them. Ax quickly reels Sherry and Nancy up from the well, but Nancy is already dead.  Sherry and Ax both escape the camp, (with a few others following them) to hitchhike once again.

Distracted, he bumps into the back of a florist's van, damaging his stock. Unfazed, Donald and his budgie take their groceries and leave, abandoning his taxi cab and passengers. He takes his groceries to the [[self-help]] group for autistic adults. Before they head to the park to meet another autistic group, he tells one member, Gracie ([[Rusty Schwimmer]]), to gather the women and he'll gather the guys to practice telling personal stories, but keeps getting distracted by performing mathematical sums of the microwaves' depleting numbers. He notices that Isabelle Sorenson ([[Radha Mitchell]]), a new name, has signed up and tells Gracie to let her go first.  At the park, Isabelle tells the women of a childhood memory: she saw that her parents were happy an Olympian had broken a record, so in order to please her parents, and taking what she heard literally, she broke their music records. Donald tells his story to the men about his ability to do complex sums but couldn't make friends. Isabelle goes on to tell of when she was raped when she went hitch-hiking. This causes Gracie to laugh manically. Heard by Donald, he tries to calm an angry Isabelle down and they find that they have much in common and take a liking to each other.  After Isabelle talks to Gregory ([[John Carroll Lynch]]), a man also in the group who is taking notes on a notepad, he calls Donald over to ask Isabelle if she may escort him to a Halloween party on his behalf. Before Donald has the chance, however, Isabelle asks Donald out for lunch. They go to the zoo the following day where Isabelle asks Donald to escort her instead of Gregory.

Unsure when to call, Donald leaves multiple messages on her phone; she finally answers and they go to the amusement park. During a ring toss, the clanging of the metal rings hitting the bottles and the ringing of a bell cause Isabelle to scream and collapse on the floor. Donald takes her back to his filthy apartment and they agree to sleep together. The following day at the self-help group, Gregory accuses Donald of exploiting his position for sexual favors. Meanwhile, Isabelle occupies herself by waiting with Bronwin ([[Erica Leerhsen]]), a member of group who recently learned that her father has blood cancer, until her parents pick her up.    Isabelle takes the liberty of cleaning his apartment while he goes shopping. When he returns, he's horrified to see that everything is different; the piles of newspaper are stacked neatly, rotting food from the fridge is thrown away and has a new shower curtain. He gets angry at Isabelle for changing everything. He later leaves a number of apologetic messages on Isabelle's phone. The next day, he goes to the hair salon where Isabelle works as a hair stylist to apologize in person, and Isabelle forgives him, introducing him as her boyfriend to the staff.  Isabelle shows Donald an abandoned rooftop, calling this a place where people who don't know where they belong can belong. She suggests that they can buy a house and her therapist has organised a job interview for a statistic analyst post at a university. He gets the job and they move into their new house, making it their own.  Donald tells Isabelle that he wants everything to be nice for when his boss, Wallace ([[Gary Cole]]) comes for dinner. Believing that he thinks that she doesn't keep the house nice, Isabelle spites Donald by keeping the pets uncaged, much to Donald's shock when he returns, and she maintains extroverted behavior and tells of her off-the-wall plans for the house. Donald explodes, but when Isabelle says that they are both crazy, he retaliates by telling her that she is crazier, which leads to her throwing him out. He stays with Gregory in his house, and after listening to an answer message that Isabelle's rabbit, Bongo, has died, he runs to comfort her. Isabelle suggests that they should just be friends.  Donald invites Isabelle to a restaurant, where he proposes to her, much to Isabelle's dismay. She leaves abruptly back home and overdoses. Donald returns just in time to take her to the hospital, where Isabelle's psychiatrist advises him to leave her alone, testing his willpower to refrain from calling her.  Donald sees Isabelle leaving the university and follows her to the abandoned rooftop, where he expresses that the only nice thing he had left to give her was not to call, to find that Isabelle was waiting for his call and she missed him. They express their true love with an embrace and kiss. The movie ends with the happy couple in their home, enjoying Thanksgiving dinner with the self-help group.  
Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005 film)
 The film opens with construction executive John ([[Brad Pitt]]) and tech support consultant Jane Smith ([[Angelina Jolie]]) answering questions during marriage counselling. The couple has been married for "five or six" years, but their marriage is suffering to the point that they cannot remember the last time they had sex. They tell the story of their first meeting in [[BogotÃ¡]], [[Colombia]], where they were both secretly on the run from the Colombian authorities - since the authorities were looking for tourists travelling alone after a recent heist, the two claimed to be together to avoid being questioned. They quickly fell in love and married. John later states that Jane "looked like Christmas morning" to him on the day they met.  In reality, John and Jane are both skilled contract killers working for different firms, both among the best in their field, each concealing their true professions from one another. The couple live in a large [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] house in the suburbs and, to keep up appearances, socialise with their "conventionally" wealthy (and disliked by each Smith) neighbors.  Under these cover stories, John and Jane balance their apparently mundane marriage â which both of them find after a few years to be growing dull and suffocating â with their secretive work. When both are assigned to kill [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] prisoner Benjamin "The Tank" Danz ([[Adam Brody]]) during a transfer, they encounter each other on the job and the hit ends up botched: Danz survives, while John and Jane are assigned to kill each other instead.  After making escalating attempts on each other's lives, the Smiths' conflict culminates in a massive shootout that nearly demolishes their home. In a protracted, evenly matched fight, they wind up with guns in each other's faces. John declines to shoot, his feelings for Jane rekindled, and lays his gun down. Jane finds she cannot shoot John either, and the two have passionate [[sex]].  The renewed Smith partnership is quickly threatened by their employers, who join forces to eliminate the couple. John's best friend and coworker, Eddie ([[Vince Vaughn]]), turns down a bounty of $400,000 for each Smith (since he won't get out of bed for anything less than $500,000), but John and Jane find themselves under fire from an army of assassins. Fending off an attack which blows up their pockmarked house, the Smiths steal their neighbor's minivan and successfully destroy their attackers' three pursuing armored sedans, all while bickering over their fighting styles and newly discovered personal secrets.  After meeting with Eddie, the Smiths decide to fight together to preserve their marriage. They kidnap Danz from his high-security prison to use him as a bargaining chip. Danz reveals that he was merely bait, hired jointly by their employers after it was discovered that the Smiths were married, in the hopes of having one Smith kill the other. John and Jane forgo their separate contingency plans and make their [[last stand]] together. In the final fight scene of the film, the Smiths â now working smoothly together as a team â defeat an extended attack by a large force of heavily armed operatives during a long [[shootout]] inside a home decorating  store.  The film ends with the couple meeting the marriage counselor ([[William Fichtner]]) again, where the Smiths state how much their marriage has thrived, with John encouraging him to ask for an update on their sex lives (to which he silently answers "10").  An alternate ending shows that they chose to move to Rome and had a child who inherited their assassin skills.  
Mrs Henderson Presents
 Eccentric 70-year-old widow Mrs [[Laura Henderson]] purchases the [[Windmill Theatre]] in [[London]], as a post-widowhood hobby and appoints autocratic manager [[Vivian Van Damm]]. In 1937, they start a continuous variety revue called "Revudeville", but after other theatres in London copy this innovation, they begin losing money. Mrs Henderson suggests they add female [[nudity]], similar to the [[Moulin Rouge]] in Paris, which is unprecedented in the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[Lord Chamberlain]] ([[Rowland Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer]]) reluctantly allows this under the condition that the nude performers remain immobile, so the performances can be considered art, the equivalent of nude statues in museums.  Because the theatre's auditorium is below street level it is relatively safe during [[The Blitz|the bombing of London]], and performances continue. The performers bravely go on with the show even during frightening bombing raids, and the posed nude girls resume their poses, after ducking, as the whole theatre is shaken and the scene [[Flats (theatre)|flats]] all round them sway when a bomb lands close by.   Maureen, one of the cast, becomes involved at Mrs Henderson's instigation with a young soldier, Paul, one of the audience regulars. Maureen becomes pregnant and receives word that after Paul is [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after the Second World War|demobilised]], he intends to return to his girlfriend. She becomes very upset about how it will affect her life, and hands in her notice. Before the issue is resolved, she is killed by a bomb while leaving the theatre.  Other scenes depict life in the theatre during the period. Mrs Henderson and Mr Van Damm frequently clash and squabble, but also show great appreciation for each other.   Eventually, the authorities want the theatre to close because of the danger of crowds gathering in the street outside the theatre. Mrs Henderson successfully argues: for soldiers going to die in the war this is their last chance, and for many of the young soldiers their only chance, to see female nudity. She reflects on the death of her son in the [[World War I|First World War]], and how he may never have even seen a naked girl except on a [[French postcard]] he'd been carrying when he died in a [[Chemical warfare|gas attack]].  The film's closing credits explain that, on her death in 1944, Mrs Henderson bequeathed the theatre to Mr Van Damm.  
La mujer de mi hermano
  ===Structure=== ''La Mujer De Mi Hermano'' ( "My Brother's Wife") could be considered in a category of films that critic Alissa Quart calls '[[hyperlink movie]]s', in which multiple stories take place, each affecting the other in ways that characters are unaware of, all the while using radically different aesthetic and cinematic techniques to define the ''[[mise en scÃ¨ne]]'' of each storyline.

Mr. Incredible and Pals
 The episode begins with Mr. Incredible, Frozone, and Mr. Skipperdoo filling us in on previous events. An evil villainess named Lady Lightbug (described by Mr. Incredible as "sinister, yet lovely") has stolen the West River Bridge, leaving cars stuck on both sides of the river. Resolving to amend the situation, Frozone builds a temporary bridge of ice, and the three skate away to find the nemesis.  Arriving at an abandoned carnival, Mr. Incredible searches for Lady Lightbug by lifting up various objects while stating that she is not under any of them. Mr. Skipperdoo hops to point out that the missing bridge is behind him. Suddenly, Lady Lightbug flies out and informs them all of her evil plan to steal the [[Free World|free world's]] bridges, creating massive traffic jams and thus destroying their economies.   She then proceeds to shoot a line of radioactive silk out of her abdomen, tying up Frozone and leaving all as lost. Mr. Incredible throws a [[Ferris wheel]] at her, which she dodges. He then hops in a roller coaster, which takes off flying toward Lady Lightbug. Mr Incredible knocks her out of the air, defeating her.   The missing bridge is restored and all returns to normal thanks to Mr. Incredible, Frozone, and Mr. Skipperdoo; Mr. Incredible adds, "and democracy." The end of the episode features a brief teaser of the next episode, featuring a gigantic anthropomorphic ear of corn yelling, âIâll crush you, Mr. Incredible!â then laughing evilly as the two prepare to fight.  
Munich (film)
 At the [[Munich massacre|1972 Munich Olympics]], the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] terrorist group [[Black September Organization|Black September]] kills eleven members of the [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Israeli Olympic team]]. Avner Kaufman, a [[Mossad]] agent of [[German Jews|German-Jewish descent]], is chosen to lead a mission to assassinate 11 Palestinians allegedly involved in the massacre. At the direction of his [[Agent handling|handler]] Ephraim, to give the Israeli government [[plausible deniability]], Avner resigns from Mossad and operates with no official ties to Israel. His team includes four Jewish volunteers from around the world: South African driver Steve, Belgian toy-maker and explosives expert Robert, former Israeli soldier and "[[cleaner (crime)|cleaner]]" Carl, and Danish document forger Hans. They are given information by a French informant, Louis. [[File:Munich Squad Pic.jpg|thumb|left|A scene from the film representing the Mossad team from 1972. From left to right: Avner Kaufman, Robert, Carl, Hans and Steve.]] In Rome, the team shoots and kills [[Wael Zwaiter]], who is living as a poet. In Paris, they detonate a bomb in the home of Mahmoud Hamshari; in [[Cyprus]], they bomb the hotel room of Hussein Abd Al Chir. With [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] commandos, they pursue three Palestiniansâ[[Muhammad Youssef al-Najjar]], Kamal Adwan, and [[Kamal Nasser]]âto Beirut, [[1973 Israeli raid on Lebanon|penetrate the Palestinians' guarded compound]] and kill all three.  Between hits, the assassins argue about the morality and logistics of their mission, expressing fear about their individual lack of experience, as well as ambivalence about accidentally killing innocent bystanders. Avner makes a brief visit to his wife, who has given birth to their first baby. In Athens, when they track down Zaiad Muchasi, the team finds out that Louis arranged for them to share a safe house with their rival [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] members, and the Mossad agents escape trouble by pretending to be members of foreign terrorist groups like [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]], [[African National Congress|ANC]], and the [[Red Army Faction]]. Avner has a heartfelt conversation with PLO member Ali over their homelands and who deserves to rule over the lands; Ali is later shot by Carl while the team escapes from the hit on Muchasi.  The squad moves to London to track down [[Ali Hassan Salameh]], who orchestrated the Munich Massacre, but the assassination attempt is interrupted by several drunken Americans. It is implied that these are agents of the CIA, which, according to Louis, protects and funds Salameh in exchange for his promise not to attack U.S. diplomats. Meanwhile, attempts are made on the assassins themselves. Carl is killed by an independent Dutch contract killer. In revenge, the team tracks her down and executes her at a houseboat in [[Hoorn]], [[Netherlands]]. Hans is found stabbed to death on a park bench, while Robert is killed by an explosion in his workshop. Avner and Steve finally locate Salameh in Spain, but again their assassination attempt is thwarted, this time by Salameh's armed guards. It is implied that Louis has sold information on the team to the PLO.  A disillusioned Avner flies to Israel, where he is unhappy to be hailed as a hero by two young soldiers, and then to his new home in Brooklyn, where he suffers post-traumatic stress and paranoia. He is thrown out of the Israeli consulate after storming in to demand that Mossad leave his wife and child alone. Ephraim comes to ask Avner to return to Israel and Mossad, but Avner refuses.  
Must Love Dogs
 Sarah Nolan, an attractive 40-year-old divorced [[preschool]] teacher, is urged by her family to date more.

Jake Anderson, another recent divorcee, finds himself in a similar position; his lawyer, Charlie, wants to set him up with a woman named Sherry.  However, Jake would rather focus on creating his handcrafted boats.  Sarah's sister Carol visits and they discuss Bob Connor, a parent from school.  Sarah is attracted to him but does not want anything complicated. Carol reveals she set up an ad for Sarah on an online dating site, [[perfectmatch.com]], using a picture from Sarah's high school graduation. The description declares she is voluptuous and that her dates "must love dogs" (Sarah is currently caring for her brother Michael's [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]] dog, "[[Mother Teresa]]", while he goes through his own marital problems). Sarah proceeds to suffer through several disastrous dates with men who cannot stop crying, are criminal, or like girls who are barely legal.  Jake is confronted by Sherry at an art gallery; she is curious why he did not call her, but again Jake does not seem interested. Charlie then hands him a printout of Sarah's dating profile and tells Jake he has a date with her the next day at a [[dog park]]. The date proves to be awkward: Jake shows up with a borrowed [[terrier]] and offends Sarah when he begins to analyze her profile. Even worse, he reveals that the dog is not really his. When she accuses him of being deceptive he points out that the requirement was "Must love dogs," not "Must own a dog."  Sarah leaves abruptly but agrees to see him again.  Sarah and Jake go on a dinner date where he asks her why she is not with her husband anymore. She explains that he just stopped loving her and that he was never ready to have children. Sarah acknowledges that her ex-husband is now with a woman fifteen years younger than she with a baby on the way. The date progresses back to Sarah's house where they discover that neither has a condom. They hastily drive around but when they finally find protection neither of them is in the mood.  Jake and Charlie are discussing Sarah when he admits that she intrigued him. That night, Jake tries to call Sarah. Meanwhile, Sarah has connected with Bob Connor. She checks to see if Bob is home but discovers he is with June, one of her co-workers. Sarah assumes they are on a date, and while fleeing the scene she drops her wallet. Sarah arrives home to find her brother Michael, who is drunkenly dealing with his own marital problems, and Jake, who has been taking care of him. Jake takes Sarah rowing and they share a kiss. Afterward he takes Michael home while Sarah lights candles and sets the mood. But Bob shows up instead of Jake. He returns her wallet, explains that he and June are not involved, and then kisses Sarah just as Jake gets back. Jake leaves, upset.  Around [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] Sarah calls Bob and they go to a hotel and have sex. In the morning Bob is rude to Sarah and during the drive home Sarah realizes that he really did sleep with June. He admits he didn't tell her because he thought they were good together and didn't want that getting in the way. Meanwhile, Jake is talked into taking Sherry to see ''[[Doctor Zhivago (1965 film)|Doctor Zhivago]]''. Sarah notices Jake leaving the theater afterward, but while discussing the film with him she notices Sherry and realizes the two of them are on a date. Sarah flees again, and when Sherry asks Jake up to her apartment, he declines and instead walks home.  Jake runs into a man named Bill outside a coffee shop, not realizing that this man is Sarah's father. When Jake confesses that he is heartbroken, Bill mentions that he has a daughter who is single but Jake declines. While drinking coffee with Sarah later, Bill quotes something that Jake said to him and Sarah realizes that Jake was talking about her. She heads over to Jake's with Mother Teresa, but he is out on the lake with his boat. When Jake can't hear her yelling from the shore she convinces a girls [[Rowing (sport)|crew]] team to take her out to him. Eventually she dives in and swims over to his boat. After climbing in Sarah tells Jake how she feels about him and they kiss. Later, when telling the story of how they met, they mention in unison that they found each other at a [[dog park]].

My Boyfriend Is Type B
 [[Lee Dong-gun]] portrays title character Young-bin, a handsome but obnoxious young man who begins the film by breaking off a relationship in a most impolite way: after waiting in a parked car so Young-bin won't get a ticket, the girlfriend reads him the riot act upon his return, prompting Young-bin to slip into the driver's seat, break up with her, and speed off, leaving his new ex-girlfriend stranded in the parking lot. From the get-go, Young-bin is not exactly a class act.  On the opposite side of the spectrum is the beautiful Ha-mi ([[Han Ji-hye]]), a meek university student looking for true love, but never seeming to find it. As is typical in this kind of film, the two meet purely by chance: Ha-mi accidentally text messages Young-bin before literally bumping into him. Ha-mi, feeling that their fortuitous meeting is a sign that they might be destined for one another, decides to pal around with Young-bin and see if there's any chemistry between them. Taken by Ha-mi's sincerity and her willingness to pick up the check, Young-bin jumps at the opportunity.  But Ha-mi's cousin, Chae-young (Shin Yi) isn't quite so enraptured with Young-bin and tries to dissuade Ha-mi from pursuing him. The thing is, Chae-young is a professional dating consultant and a strong subscriber to blood type personality theory. According to her, any relationship between the mismatched duo would be doomed to failure because Young-bin is a type-B male, which supposedly makes him arrogant, hardheaded, and generally a jerk, whereas Ha-mi is a type-A female, one who supposedly can't help being timid and obedient. But while Chae-young predicts impending doom, the happy couple try to give love a shot, ignoring their supposed blood type incompatibility.

The MySpace Movie
 The MySpace Movie explores the basics of life as well as disputed territories located within the [[MySpace]] site in a humorous and parodic fashion. Themes of this movie include:  *Capturing profile images. *[[Dating]] on MySpace. *Excessive chain bulletins. *MySpace's "Top 8" feature. *A humorous portrayal of [[Tom Anderson (MySpace)|Tom Anderson]], the "creator" of MySpace.  ===The blind date=== This story opens with two males sitting in front of a computer and the first male attempts to show off his prize catch, a woman named Yeta, whose profile they are both examining. His friend believes that the woman has "The Angles", a term referring to the practice of taking photographs from such extreme angles as to obscure or distort the person in question, thus implying that the user is insecure about their image and, presumably, unattractive. He also insists that the woman's name is not ''Yeta'', but [[Yeti]]. Shortly afterwards the first male receives a telephone call from the woman in question, whose audible voice bears a close resemblance to that of [[Chewbacca]] from [[Star Wars]]. They arrange a date for the evening, with the friend insisting upon chaperoning. Once the two meet, the man is horrified to observe that his date is masculine, grunting, and lurching. She immediately rubs up against him, asking "Do you want to see the Angry Beaver?", a now popular quote.  David Lehre (the creator) stars in this chapter.  ===The bulletin=== This begins with a man reading a bulletin, and having to scroll down excessively. It then reads that if he doesn't repost, he will first hear a duck call, then be killed by a crazy drunken hunter asking for circus peanuts. This is commonly found in many MySpace bulletins today. Finally, during his last moments of life he will see a singing fish. He casually ignores the bulletin as a joke, and is soon thereafter killed precisely as described. The scene takes place in Reese Serra's apartment.  ===The password=== A prominent feature of MySpace is that of the "Top 8" (Although you may have a "top" of as many as 40), which is essentially the ability to display upon a user's profile page a link to 40 of his chosen friends. In this scene a couple at a computer are arguing; the woman is complaining about her partner's choice of Top 8 friends, expressing dissatisfaction at the fact that she is not among them, as well as questioning the integrity of those present. After demanding his password, she is able to log in and see the rest of his pictures, which include photographs of his participation in lewd activities, including that of judging a wet T-shirt competition.  In this scene one can see the email address joejoe227@yahoo.com.  ===The party=== This short segment proposes a humorous theory as to the origin of MySpace creator [[Tom Anderson (MySpace)|Tom Anderson]]'s default profile picture - arriving at a college party, where he is immediately the center of attention. (This directly alludes to the fact that whenever a new profile on MySpace is made, Anderson is automatically added as the user's first friend. For this reason, Anderson's profile has over two hundred million friends, and in the movie it is humorously assumed that every one of those people is a close friend of his). Later on, Anderson consumes copious amounts of [[pizza]], [[alcohol]], and even [[cocaine]]. A short time later, presumably the morning after, the crowd of MySpace users from the previous evening open the bathroom door while Anderson is vomiting, and take his picture as he hunches over the bowl, resembling Anderson's actual profile picture.

Taking these facts into consideration, Insp. Tejpal starts to disbelieve and suspect Ravi. Ravi's assistant Reena,([[Nandana Sen]]) tries to help Ravi. However, her involvement makes the matter worse for her and her boy-friend Raj, (Rajesh Kapoor), who suspects her to have a relation with her boss Ravi.

Along the journey, a Korean warrior attempts to seize her back but Meng Yi saves her. Ok-soo falls in love with Meng Yi and displays her affections for him openly, but Meng honourably rejects her and successfully completes his mission. The Qin emperor becomes critically ill later and he sends Meng Yi to find the [[Elixir of life|elixir of immortality]], the only thing that can save his life. The guards escorting the elixir are ambushed by rebels on the orders of the treacherous prince and chancellor. Meng Yi hands over the elixir to his deputy, Nangong Yan, before dying in the ensuing battle. Although Nangong Yan manages to bring the elixir to the emperor, the prince and chancellor wanted Nangong Yan and Ok-soo to test the validity of the elixir and force them to consume the elixir, condemning them to imprisonment in the [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor|Qin emperor's mausoleum]] for eternity.  In the present day, Jack, an archaeologist, is Meng Yi's reincarnation, and he often dreams about his past life. One day, his friend William invites him on a quest to find a rare material that can create a field of zero gravity. They travel to a floating tomb of a [[Chenna Dasar|Dasar]] prince in India, where Jack discovers a painting of the princess he has been seeing in his dreams. Jack also learns that during a mission to the Qin Empire, the Dasar prince brought treasures and women as gifts. In return, the Qin emperor offered him one of his concubines and asked him to choose, but refused when the prince chose his favourite, Ok-soo. Instead, the Qin emperor gave him a painting of Ok-soo and the Qin Star Gem. William removes a strange black rock from a feline statue, and accidentally collapses the zero gravity field holding up the tomb, resulting in its destruction. William manages to escape but Jack leaps off a cliff and falls into a river. He loses consciousness and drifts along with the current until he is saved by Samantha, an Indian peasant girl. Samantha brings Jack to see her uncle, a [[Kalaripayattu]] guru, who tells Jack to take the sword he found and fight with one of his students. During the fight, Jack has a recollection of a duel he had with the Dasar prince in his past life, and briefly recovers his fighting skills from his life as Meng Yi. Samantha's uncle enlightens Jack about his past and future, and Jack succeeds in returning home safely and he delivers the sword to the [[National Museum of China]] as a national treasure. His action angered Professor Koo, the leader of the syndicate that has been funding Jack and William's treasure hunt.  After extensive research, Jack and William conclude that the anti-gravity material is a fragment of a meteorite that fell to Earth during the Qin dynasty. They find the location of the Qin emperor's mausoleum, concealed behind a waterfall. The massive tomb contains the strongest fragment of the meteorite, powerful enough to make the tomb a floating palace. Jack meets Ok-soo and Nangong Yan alive inside the tomb and they mistake him for Meng Yi. Professor Koo and his men enter and attempt to seize the immortality elixir, leading to an aerial fight between both parties. William accidentally breaks the balance of the field after removing a piece of the meteorite and causes the tomb to collapse on itself, and dies from drowning in mercury. While Jack is escaping from the collapsing tomb, he asks Ok-soo to come with him, but she refuses after realising he is not Meng Yi and says she will wait for the real Meng Yi forever, believing he still lives. As Koo nears the elixir, Yan grabs onto him as they fall and presumably perish.  Jack is then seen at home with a published copy of ''The Myth'', a book written by him about his adventure and his experiences which he dedicates to William.

Nanny McPhee
 In [[Victorian England]] in the 1860s, widowed undertaker Cedric Brown has seven unruly children. He is clumsy and loves his children but since the death of his wife has spent little time with them and cannot handle them. The children have had a series of nannies, whom they have systematically driven out by their bad behaviour. They also take great pleasure in terrorizing their cook, Mrs. Blatherwick. Besides their father, the only one the children will ever listen to is Evangeline, the family's uneducated but sweet-natured [[scullery maid]].  One day, Cedric discovers multiple references for a "Nanny McPhee throughout the home. That same night during a storm, the children cause havoc in the kitchen at the same time Cedric sees a shadow behind the door and opens it to reveal a frighteningly hideous woman, who states that she is Nanny McPhee and is a "government nanny". With discipline and a little [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], she transforms the family's lives. In the process, she changes from ugly to beautiful, her warts and unibrow disappearing and her oversized nose shrinking. The children, led by the eldest son Simon, try to play their tricks on her, but gradually start to respect her and ask her for advice. They change to responsible people helping their clumsy father in solving the family problems, making Nanny McPhee less and less needed.  The family is financially supported by Cedric's late wife's domineering and nearsighted aunt Lady Adelaide Stitch, who demands custody over one of the children. She first wants Christianna (Chrissie), one of the daughters, but Evangeline volunteers and Adelaide agrees, assuming she is one of the daughters. She also threatens to reduce the family to poverty unless Cedric remarries within the month; the family would lose the house, and they would not be able to stay together. Desperate, Cedric turns to a vile and frequent widow, Mrs. Selma Quickly. The children assume from reading books of fairy-tales that all [[stepmother]]s are terrible women who treat their stepchildren like slaves; therefore they sabotage a visit of Mrs. Quickly, who leaves, angry at Cedric. After the financial rationale for the marriage is explained to the children, they agree to the marriage, and appease Mrs. Quickly by confessing they were to blame for the disturbance of her visit, luring her back to their father with tales of their Great Aunt Adelaide's wealth.  However, the children soon discover that Mrs. Quickly is just as cruel and awful as any fairytale stepmother when she breaks baby Aggie's beloved rattle (which previously belonged to their late mother, and was the only thing they had left of her.) When everybody is gathered for the marriage ceremony, they disturb the ceremony by pretending there are bees (inspired by the way Quickly told them to "behave" and baby Aggie repeating the word, but pronouncing it as "beehive"), chasing the guests, and throwing the pastries intended for the banquet at everyone present. Cedric swiftly understands that they do not like the bride and, recognising that he does not like her either, joins in the commotion himself. Mrs. Quickly cancels the marriage and storms off in anger. This seems to mean that Adelaide's marriage deadline is missed, but Lily asks Evangeline whether she loves Cedric. She first denies, explaining that it would be inappropriate because of her station as maidservant, but then confirms she does. Cedric, who loves Evangeline back, marries Evangeline then and there, satisfying Aunt Adelaide's conditions for maintaining his allowance; and Nanny McPhee (who is now beautiful), magically makes it snow, which transforms the wedding scene and changes Evangeline's clothes into a beautiful wedding dress, and restores the children's real mother's rattle for them.  Nanny McPhee leaves surreptitiously, in accordance with what she told the children before on her first night: "When you need me, but do not want me, then I must stay. When you want me, but no longer need me, then I have to go".

The Neighbor No. Thirteen
 Juzo Murasaki ([[Oguri Shun]]) arrives at a work construction area for his new job as a construction worker. To his quiet dismay, his supervising boss is Toru Akai ([[Hirofumi Arai]]) who, along with his gang, had made Juzo's life a living hell during their middle school years. Akai however doesn't recognise Juzo.  Juzo becomes more disconcerted when he discovers Akai is living with his wife, Nozomi Akai ([[Yumi Yoshimura]]), and their toddler son above Juzo's new apartment. As he struggles to accept those unexpected developments, a mysterious sinister-looking hooded figure appears nearby. When Juzo later has a closer look, half of the man's face is scarred and he calls himself Number 13 ([[Nakamura Shido]]).  As Juzo attempts to control his flashbacks and dreams, boss Akai constantly picks on him and other workers including another former middle-school student Seki Hajime ([[Tomoya Ishii]]), who ignores Juzo's asocial tendencies by being a friendly face. Meanwhile, Akai's wife Nozomi attempts to make friends with Juzo by inviting him into her home and encouraging him to look after her toddler son. One evening she proudly shows Juzo her husband's school photos. Juzo notices the mark X in a gap between students. He suffers an intense flashback, which reveals the cause of his absence that day: Akai and his gang bully Akai in the school's science room until they throw acid at Juzo's face.  At construction site, Seki becomes suspicious of Juzo's increasingly odd behaviour, and goes to Akai with his concerns. Unaware that Number 13 is watching, Seki tries to get Akai's attention, but Akai walks away. Seki becomes aware of Number 13, who immediately kills him. Number 13 haunts Juzo wherever he goes. Meanwhile, Arai watches Juzo with growing suspicion as a number of his workers and neighbours disappear without trace.  After finding Nozomi's body in the apartment upstairs with the toddler nowhere in sight, Juzo realises where Number 13 has taken the toddler son to and hurries off to save the boy. Coming home from work, Akai discovers his wife's body and his son gone. He's already guessed Juzo was a former classmate and that he has taken his son to their middle school.  At school, Juzo finds the toddler drowned in a school bathroom and realises Number 13 is out of control. He walks around the school, trying to find Number 13. He comes across Akai, who attacks Juzo while demanding his son back. After a violent confrontation, Juzoâwho we realise is Number 13 all alongâkneels over Akai on the floor. As he is about to stab Akai's head, Akai desperately shouts: "I'm sorry!" Juzo freezes. The apology splits Juzo's universe into two.  Universe #1: as described above.  Universe #2: in the science room, Juzo rebels against Akai's bullying, which causes Akai to apologise. Juzo later appears in a class photo as a happy-looking middle school student next to Akai and the gang. As an adult, he walks past an apartment block where he and the Akai family lived in Universe #1. Juzo notes construction workers are taking down the apartment-block sign, which suggests the block is slated to be demolished. He spots a dark hooded figure standing in a window. It's Number 13. Juzo looks away as if he doesn't recognise him, and continues walking next to his work friend. It's Akai.  At this point, we viewers realise the events in Universe #1 never took place in Universe #2. Universe #1 is a scenario of what could have been if Juzo hadn't stood up to Akai's bullying in the science room, which could end with having acid thrown at Juzo's face. This would have given birth to Number 13 albeit Universe #1.

The New World (2005 film)
  In 1607, [[Pocahontas]], the spirited and adventurous daughter of [[Chief Powhatan]], and others from her tribe witness the [[Jamestown Expedition|arrival of three ships]] sent by [[kingdom of England|English]] [[London Company|royal charter to found a colony]] in the [[New World]]. Aboard one of the ships is [[John Smith (explorer)|Captain John Smith]], below decks, in chains. While initially sentenced to death by hanging for his mutinous remarks, once ashore, Smith is pardoned by Captain [[Christopher Newport]], the leader of the expedition.  While the prospects for the settlement are initially bright, disease, poor discipline, supply shortages, and tensions with the local Native Americans (whom Newport calls "the naturals") place the expedition in jeopardy. Smith takes a small group of men upriver to seek trade while Newport returns to England for supplies. While on this mission, Smith is captured by a group of Native Americans and brought before their Chief Powhatan. After being questioned, the captain is nearly executed. He is spared when Pocahontas intervenes and saves his life.  Living among the Native Americans as a prisoner for an extended period, Smith is treated well and earns the friendship and respect of the tribe. Coming to admire this new way of life, he falls deeply in love with Pocahontas. She is intrigued by the Englishman and his ways. The chief returns Smith to Jamestown with the understanding that the English are to leave the following spring, once their boats have returned. Upon his return, Smith encounters the settlement in turmoil. Pressed into accepting the governorship, he finds the peace he had with the Natives replaced by privation, death, and the difficult responsibilities of his new position. Smith wishes to return to his love but dismisses such action. He thinks of his time among the Native Americans as "a dream" from which he has awoken. Their numbers dwindle throughout the brutal winter, and the settlers are saved only when Pocahontas and a rescue party arrive with food, clothing, and supplies.  As spring arrives, Powhatan realizes that the English do not intend to leave. Discovering his daughter's actions, he orders an attack on Jamestown and exiles Pocahontas. Repulsing the attack, the settlers learn of Pocahontas' banishment from her own homeland. They organize a trade so that the young woman can be taken captive and used as leverage to avoid further assaults. [[Samuel Argall]] convinces the settlers on a trading expedition up the [[Potomac River]] to abduct Pocahontas from the [[Patawomeck]]s as a prisoner to negotiate with her father for an exchange for some captive settlers, but not the stolen weapons and tools. When Smith opposes the plan, he is removed as governor. After Pocahontas is brought to Jamestown, she and Smith renew their love affair. The return of Captain Newport adds complications. Newport tells Smith of an offer from the king to lead his own expedition to find passage to the East Indies. Torn between his love and the promise of his career, the captain decides to return to England. Before he departs, he leaves instructions with another settler. The settler later tells Pocahontas that Smith has died in the crossing, which leaves her distraught.  Devastated, Pocahontas sinks into depression and still mourns the "death" of her love. Continuing to live in Jamestown, she is eventually comforted by a new settler, [[John Rolfe]]. He helps her adapt to the English way of life. She is baptized, receives education, and eventually marries Rolfe and gives birth to a son whom they name [[Thomas Rolfe|Thomas]]. She later learns that Captain Smith is indeed still alive, news to which she has a violent reaction. Pocahontas finds herself rejecting Rolfe and retreats to her loyalty to Smith, thinking fate had spared his life and they were to be reunited. Rolfe and his family are given a chance to travel to England. Arriving in London and sharing an audience with the king and queen, Pocahontas is overwhelmed by the wonders of this "New World." While there, she has a private meeting with Smith.  The reunion is uncomfortable at times. The state of their present lives shows how much they each have changed. Smith admits that he may have made a mistake in choosing his career over his love for Pocahontas. He says that what they experienced in Virginia was not a dream but instead "the only truth." When asked by Pocahontas if he ever found his Indies, he replies, "I may have sailed past them." The two part, never to meet again. Realizing that Rolfe is the man she thought he was and more, she finally accepts him as her husband and love. Pocahontas and Rolfe make arrangements to return to Virginia. Before they depart, she falls ill from [[pneumonia]] and dies.  The film ends with images of the young adult Pocahontas and her young son happily playing in the gardens of their English estate. Rolfe, in a voice over, reads a letter, addressed to their only son about his deceased Native American mother. In the film's closing moments, Pocahontas says, "Mother, now I know where you live" with the film fading out over images of nature in the New World.

Noriko's Dinner Table
 The film is divided into 5 chapters, the first four of which are named after characters in the film: Noriko, Yuka, Kumiko and Tetsuzo, in that order. The plot is told non-linearly and shifts between the perspectives of Noriko, Yuka and Tetsuzo.  A shy and demure 17-year-old teenage girl named Noriko Shimabara ([[Kazue Fukiishi]]) lives with her quiet family, formed by her sister Yuka ([[Yuriko Yoshitaka]]), her mother Taeko (Sanae Miyata), and her father Tetsuzo ([[Ken Mitsuishi]]), in [[Toyokawa]], [[Japan]]. Noriko finds her small-town life unsatisfying and craves to move to [[Tokyo]], assuming she would live a more active life there. This sentiment is especially encouraged when she finds that her [[elementary school]] friend Tangerine ([[Yoko Mitsuya]]) is now working independently as an [[Japanese idol|idol]]. Noriko's father is strictly against her going to the city, and plans on having her join a local university after school.  Feeling alienated and misunderstood by her parents, Noriko resorts to the internet where she finds Haikyo.com, a website where other teenagers from Japan gather. There, after making new and unknown friends, she feels truly at "home" and eventually, on December 10, 2001, runs away from her unhappy life to Tokyo, where she plans on meeting the website's leader, a mysterious girl who uses the screen name "Ueno Station 54". Once in [[Tokyo]], Noriko logs onto the website and contacts Ueno54. They meet up at Locker #54 in Ueno Train Station, where it is revealed that she is a young woman named Kumiko. She introduces Noriko to her family and takes Noriko to visit her grandparents. As it turns out, however, Kumiko has no real family, and the people she introduced Noriko to are paid actors working for Kumiko's organisation, I.C. Corp. The organisation offers paid [[roleplay]] services to interested clients, allowing them to fulfil their fantasies of a happy family life.  Six months later, 54 girls jump in front of a train at Shinjuku station and commit suicide while Noriko and Kumiko look on. It is implied that the 54 were members of the organization acting out their roles. Back in Toyokawa, Yuka, who was also a member of Haikyo.com, wonders if her sister was involved in the mass suicide. She writes a story speculating how her father would react if she were to disappear as well, and deliberately leaves clues before running off to Tokyo to join I.C. Corp.  Tetsuzo attempts to put on a brave face after Yuka's disappearance, but his wife Taeko's mental condition deteriorates rapidly and she eventually commits suicide. Meanwhile, Tetsuzo, a reporter, gathers clues regarding his daughters' disappearances and discovers Yuka's story. He is crushed to find that his daughter could predict his actions and behaviour so accurately while he was completely aloof of his daughters' feelings. His investigations reveal Haikyo.com and taking a cue from sensationalist media tabloids, he concludes that his daughters are part of a [[cult]] called the "Suicide Club".  Tetsuzo contacts a member of I.C. Corp, who refutes the existence of a "suicide club" and instead expounds on a concept of social roles that forms the basis of his organisation. Tetsuzo gets an old friend of his, Ikeda (Shirou Namiki) to pose as a client for I.C. Corp and rent Kumiko as his wife, and Noriko and Yuka as his daughters (who go by the aliases Mitsuko and Yoko respectively). Tetsuzo finds a house in Tokyo resembling his own and moves all the furniture from the old house to the new one, to resemble it exactly. Mitsuko and Yoko are unsettled when they arrive at the house, but fall back into their roles when prompted by Kumiko. Ikeda sends Kumiko away on an errand and Tetsuzo reveals himself. The girls, however, treat him as a stranger and insist that they are Mitsuko and Yoko, not Noriko and Yuka.  As the session falls apart, thugs from the organisation arrive on site to beat up Tetsuzo, who attacks them with a knife and kills all of them in the living room. Kumiko arrives from her errand shortly thereafter playing out her role as if nothing is wrong, but then implores Tetsuzo to kill her and run away with Noriko and Yuka. Her insistence gravely disturbs Noriko and Yuka, before Yuka interrupts the heated conversation and asks to 'extend the session'.  Finally, Tetsuzo, Kumiko, Mitsuko and Yuka dine together as a happy family and Tetsuzo begins acting as if Kumiko is his wife, calling her Taeko. Yuka does not sleep that night and at the leaves the home at crack of dawn, shedding her roles and names. Mitsuko awakens shortly thereafter and to herself, bids goodbye to Yuka, adolescence, Haikyo.com and Mitsuko, before finally declaring that she is Noriko.  By the end, two years have passed in this film and 18 months since ''Suicide Club''.

In 1949, she departs for New York City, where she enrolls in an acting class. Amateur photographer Jerry Tibbs discovers her walking on the beach at [[Coney Island]] and she agrees to model for him. He suggests she restyle her hair with the bangs that would become her trademark.  Bettie becomes a favorite of nature photographers (including [[Bunny Yeager]], who films her posing with two leopards), and she has no hesitation about removing her clothes for the photographers when asked. Before long images of the shapely brunette reach brother-and-sister entrepreneurs Paula and [[Irving Klaw]], who run a respectable business selling [[Film still|movie stills]] and memorabilia, but also deal with [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] photos, magazines, and 8- and 16-millimeter films for additional income. Their top model Maxie takes Bettie under her wing, and she soon finds herself wearing leather corsets and thigh-high boots while wielding whips and chains for photographer [[John Willie]], frequently at the request of Little John, a mild-mannered attorney with unusual tastes. Bettie is innocently unaware of the sexual nature of the images that rapidly are making her a star in the underground world of [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] aficionados.  Bettie is called to testify before a 1955 hearing, headed by Senator [[Estes Kefauver]], investigating the effects of pornography on American youth. Though she waits patiently for 12 hours to answer the committee's questions, Kefauver (for reasons unknown) decides to not bring her before the committee and dismisses her without an explanation. When it becomes apparent that casting directors are more interested in her notoriety than in any acting talent she might possess, Bettie heads to [[Miami Beach]]. Drifting along with limited career prospects and a virtually nonexistent social life, she stumbles upon a small [[Evangelical]] church, walks inside and rushes forward to embrace [[Jesus Christ]] during the [[altar call]]. Although she insists she is not ashamed of anything she has done in her life, she appears happy to leave her past behind and return to her spiritual roots by preaching the word of the Lord on street corners.  Back in New York, Irving is stressed out and suffering from ill health. He decides that his sister and he must burn their vast collection of erotic photos, and movie footage to avoid potential prosecution. Paula reluctantly complies with her brother's request, but secretly saves the negatives of many of Bettie's pictures and movies from the bonfire, therefore ensuring that Bettie's work will survive for future generations.  
North Country (film)
 In 1989, Josey Aimes flees from her abusive husband back to her hometown in northern [[Minnesota]] with her children, Sammy and Karen, and moves in with her parents, Alice and Hank. Hank is ashamed of Josey, who had Sammy as a teenager by an unknown father, and believes Josey is [[promiscuous]]. While working a job washing hair, Josey reconnects with an old acquaintance, Glory Dodge, who works at the local iron mine and suggests Josey do the same, as a job there pays six times more than what Josey's making now. Josey's pursuit of the job further strains her relationship with Hank, who also works at the mine and believes women shouldn't be working there, so she and her children move in with Glory and her husband, Kyle.  Josey quickly befriends several other female workers at the mine and soon realizes the women are constant targets for sexual harassment and humiliation by most of their male co-workers, who, like Hank, believe the women are taking jobs more appropriate for men. Josey in particular is targeted by Bobby Sharp, an old friend from high school. Josey tries to talk to her supervisor, Arlen Pavich, about the problem, but he refuses to take her concerns seriously. The women experience additional harassment in retaliation, and Bobby spreads rumors that Josey attempted to seduce him, leading his wife to publicly berate and embarrass Josey at Sammy's hockey game. Sammy begins to resent the way the townspeople treat them and comes to believe the gossip about his mother's alleged promiscuity.  Josey takes her concerns to the mine's owner, Don Pearson, but despite his previous assurances that he is there to help, she arrives to find that he has invited Pavich to the meeting, along with several other executives and offers to accept her resignation immediately. She refuses, and after Pearson implies he believes the rumors about her promiscuity, leaves devastated. Later, after being sexually assaulted by Bobby at work, she quits and asks Bill White, a lawyer friend of Kyle and Glory, to help her file a lawsuit against the company. Bill advises her to recruit other women to form a [[class action]] lawsuit, which would be the first of its kind. The female miners, however, fear losing their jobs and facing additional harassment, so Josey attempts to go ahead with the case alone. She also discovers that Glory has [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Lou Gehrig's Disease]], and her health is declining rapidly.  Alice and Hank argue over Josey's lawsuit, and when Hank still refuses to forgive his daughter, Alice leaves him. At a union meeting, Josey attempts to address the miners and explain her reasons for suing the mine, but they constantly interrupt and insult her, leading Hank to stand up for his daughter and reprimand his co-workers for their treatment of Josey and all the women at the mine. He and Alice then reconcile. In court, the mining company's attorney attempts to hold Josey's sexual history against her, based on Bobby's testimony that Sammy is the result of a consensual sexual relationship between Josey and her high school teacher, Mr. Lattavansky. Josey then reveals that after school one day, where she and Bobby had been serving [[school detention|detention]] together after being caught kissing, she was raped by Mr. Lattavansky, which led to her pregnancy and eventually Sammy's birth.  Hank attacks the teacher in question, who is in attendance, and Bill asks for a recess after Josey storms out of the courtroom. Sammy still refuses to believe his mother and runs away, until Kyle urges him to reconsider, and he and Josey embrace after having a talk. The next day, Bill cross-examines Bobby and gets him to admit he lied about the encounter, which he witnessed but was too scared to do anything about. Glory, who has come to the court in her wheelchair and is unable to speak, has Kyle read a letter saying she stands with Josey. Other women then stand up to support Josey's complaint. They are followed by more women, family members, and miners, which allows the case to qualify as a class action. The mining company is forced to both pay the women for their suffering and establish a [[sexual harassment]] policy at the workplace.  
The Nun (2005 film)
  An insane nun terrorizes her students. One of the girls named Mary is discovered to have been impregnated by an important official at the school. The malicious Nun Sister Ursula walks in on her in the bathroom to see what she is doing and discovers her secret.  Disgusted, the Nun tries to force an abortion on the girl with a bathroom appliance. But her friends, having snuck out earlier that same night to have a midnight snack, hear Mary screaming in pain as the Nun brutalises her. They attack the Nun and force her to release Mary, causing her to bump her head and fall into a bathtub filled with water.   The girls leave Sister Ursula in a pond blessed by priests as Holy Water. They swear an oath of secrecy, and the Spanish Authorities of Barcelona simply report the Sister missing.  Eighteen years later, the pond is drained. The vengeful soul of the nun is thus freed from her watery prison, and leaves to wreak havoc on the lives of the girls who were her mortal downfall.  A young girl, [[Eve]]- goes to the boarding school, after her mother (the pregnant girl Ursula wanted to 'cleanse') is murdered, to find out what is going on. There, she meets the other two survivors, and together with some of Eve's friends, they defend themselves from Ursula's spirit whilst desperately trying to figure out how to banish the [[nun]] once and for all.  The first act of the ghostly Ursula is the incineration. Then Mary herself is attacked by the evil spirit in her own home. Eve, the main character of this film, arrives home to see an apparition slitting her mother's throat before leaving through a window. After reporting this to the police and being disbelieved - her mother's death being recorded as suicide - Eve joins with an old friend of her mother's to create her own investigation.  After Joanna's death in London, Christy, along with all the other girls involved in the Ursula incident, had suspected that it was not an accident and that it somehow had something to do with the murder they had committed years earlier. Christy plans to tell Eve everything she knows, but before they are able to meet for the discussion, Christy is killed in an elevator, her hands horribly severed.   Eve returns home that night and finds an old love letter addressed to her mother, by someone named Miguel. But other than that she finds nothing that could point her to the answers she needs. So Eve takes it upon herself to see the other members of her mother's circle of friends and warn them before it is too late. She goes to a Special Theological Institute where she can find the archives of the old boarding school, which had been shut down after the Nun's disappearance. The woman told her she was going to meet with her mother the next day and all of the other classmates in Barcelona, Spain. Eve decides to go to Barcelona, warn them, and try to find out what had actually happened.   Later on, she meets and falls in love with Gabriel, a young Spanish man who is studying to be a [[priest]] and employs him to translate all of the archival documents for her. He returns later that night with the information she seeks including the address of one of the survivors, a woman named Eulalia who is native to Barcelona. But she arrives too late as Eulalia is murdered by the Nun by being crucified in her own bathroom. She and the others arrived on the scene to see Eulalia dead but also hear a message left on the answering machine by the last two survivors of the group asking her to meet with them on the old boarding school. She and her friends go there to warn them. She explains that Eulalia and Christy are both dead and that she has seen the killer and knows her to be the nun Ursula. The women explain to her that this is impossible because they had taken her life years before.  Eve asks them where Ursula's old room is, and once there she and the young priest find a Bible dedicated to Ursula by a priest named Father Miguel. Eve remembers the name Miguel and tries to understand what is familiar about it. In a romantic moment, she and the young priest kiss - only for Eve to stop it as she does not want to do anything in the room where the creature that had killed her mother once lived.  The Priest receives a moment of clarity and asks her to remain there while he goes to check something. Once alone, the spirit of the dead nun in the form of water appears under the covers of her old bed and passes right though Eve. Eve receives a vision of her mother in the past, speaking on the phone to a man named Miguel. Once the Priest returns he finds her in a state of shock and comforts her then shows her what he has discovered. As everyone gathers in a hallway, he explains that each of the girls, the women who are now dying, share their names with Catholic saints. As these saints died, so are the women dying. A sick re-enactment of the Martyrdom.  At this point, one of the two remaining women starts to vocally blame Eve for the trouble they are all in, as she is "the sin" that Sister Ursula was trying to purge in the first place. She locks herself up in a room, where the Nun then kills her by decapitation. The last survivor tells Eve that her father was a catholic priest, Father Miguel, and that was why the other survivor blamed her. Gabriel supposes that the Nun could only die in the water and that she can only be killed as her own namesake Saint, St. Ursula had died: by an arrow through the heart. They make a makeshift arrow and place it in a gun to fire it into the Nun's heart and kill her once and for all. They do not manage to lay Ursula to rest in time to save the last survivor, who is burned to death in an oven. Unfortunately Gabriel is also killed, as he is hurled into a wall by a bursting water main, due to a plan to flood a room so that Eve could vanquish the spirit of Ursula.  Eve enters the room, takes breaths and waits underwater with the gun in hand to face her opponent. Joel tells Julia that his theory is that he believes that Eve must have always been mentally deranged, and knew all along that she had been fathered by a Priest. He supposes that her mother and mother's friends had murdered the nun. So, she somehow developed a split personality taking on the role of the nun and thus carried out these murders in her name. They then go down to where the water is flooded and see Eve killed by her own spear.

Odd Girl Out
 Vanessa Snyder ([[Alexa Vega]]) is a well-respected eighth grader in her school. She has a loving single, divorced mother, Barbara ([[Lisa Vidal]]), who is proud of her academically and socially successful daughter. Vanessa is also "in" with the popular [[clique]], which consists of her best friend Stacey Larson ([[Leah Pipes]]), the [[queen bee (sociology)|queen bee]], and Nikki Rodriguez ([[Elizabeth Rice]]), who is secretly jealous of the bond between her two friends. On the exterior of the circle is the [[Outcast (person)|outsider]], Emily (Shari Dyon Perry), and the "[[wikt:wannabe|wannabe]]," Tiffany Thompson ([[Alicia Morton]]), who is dying to make it into the group.  One day, Nikki tricks Vanessa into getting close to Tony (Chad Biagini), a boy whom Stacey (and somewhat Vanessa) has a crush on. A web of lies, nasty rumors, and manipulation ensues, and Vanessa is ostracized by the [[clique]] for "[[backstabbing]]" Stacy. Nikki gets Tiffany accepted into the clique, and Tiffany becomes Nikki's sidekick at bullying. Although Nikki is the main bully, Stacey plays her part by pretending she's still Vanessa's friend and not stopping the attacks. Vanessa is slowly pushed out of class activities, socially isolated and her tormentors create a website that bashes her.  Although Emily tries to convince Vanessa not to go running back to the clique, Vanessa keeps attempting to seek reconciliation with Stacey, to disastrous results. One day, Vanessa tries to sit with the girls at lunchtime, but they reject her. Vanessa runs off into the girls' bathroom, and hides inside one of the stalls. The girls go in and gossip about her, some half-aware of her presence. That night, Vanessa suffers a [[nervous breakdown]] and chops most of her hair off. Then she starts [[truancy|skipping school]], fearing the agony in the hallways. Stacey offers a fake truce to Vanessa, making it look like Vanessa copied one of Stacey's assignments when it was in fact vice versa.  Once Barbara sees printed-out disdainful comments about Vanessa's hair, she tries to help by informing the school about the bullying. Principal Jessup states that she is unable to take disciplinary action against [[verbal abuse]]. Barbara even tries to reason with Stacey's mother, Denise ([[Rhoda Griffis]]), but only ends up straining their friendship.  Vanessa's spirits are suddenly lifted when she is invited to Stacey's birthday party. After getting all dressed up, she and Barbara arrive at a nightclub that Stacey had claimed to be the location of the party, but it turns out that there was no party at all. After returning home, Vanessa goes ballistic and later attempts [[suicide]] by taking an overdose of Barbara's sleeping pills, causing her to pass out on the bathroom floor. Barbara soon discovers this and immediately calls an ambulance. As Vanessa is being put into the ambulance, a boy from her school records the incident. Vanessa is taken to the hospital and treated.  In the hospital, Barbara reveals to Vanessa that she was also bullied when she was a teenager, which causes her to encourage Vanessa to stay friends with Stacey. She says that she never personally dealt with it and wishes that Vanessa would stand up for herself. Nikki and Tiffany insult Vanessa even after she attempts suicide; they watch a video of her being taken to the hospital and call her a "druggie" and a "pathetic loser." During a class session, Emily accuses Stacey of nearly killing Vanessa by her actions. She is also the only one of Vanessa's classmates to visit her in the hospital and befriend her. Back home, Barbara spots malicious [[instant messages]] popping up on Vanessa's computer and sends them to Principal Jessup. The culprits are Nikki, Tiffany, and Ezra (Joey Nappo) and are told by Principal Jessup that a new policy against cyberbullying student harassment is now being enforced at the school after what happened to Vanessa. She then gives them the ultimatum: If they admit that they have been [[cyberbullying]] Vanessa, they would only be suspended for a week. But if they don't confess, they would be expelled from school and will not graduate with their class.  When Vanessa returns to school, Stacey convinces her that she's sorry about the bullying, reuniting them both. They IM each other about how great it is to be best friends again. Then graduation day comes and the final dispute happens after the ceremony - Nikki and Tiffany derisively read the chat between Vanessa and Stacey, which Stacey had sent to Nikki, who printed it out, aloud in the crowded hallway. Vanessa confronts Stacey in front of the whole class, bringing everything down on her and sees right through her lies. Humiliated, Stacey flees the school in tears and her two "[[henchman|henchwomen]]," Nikki and Tiffany, are left powerless without a leader. The class applauds Vanessa as she hugs Emily, her only true friend. Barbara, who witnessed the whole exchange, watches with pride as the two friends leave for an after-party, permanently disbanding the bullying clique.

After he collapses from hunger and exhaustion, a kindly old woman gives him food and lodgings for the night. After a week of travel, he arrives at the city, barefoot and penniless. He meets Jack Dawkins, or "[[The Artful Dodger]]," a boy-thief who takes Oliver to his home and hideout at [[Saffron Hill]] that he shares with many other young [[pickpockets]] and their eccentric elderly leader, [[Fagin]]. Soon, Oliver is being groomed to join their gang. On his first outing with the pickpockets, two of the boys steal a manâs handkerchief and Oliver is framed. However he is proven innocent by an eyewitness, and the owner of the handkerchief (the wealthy [[Mr. Brownlow]]) takes pity on Oliver, who had collapsed from a fever in the courtroom. Brownlow, believing that Oliver is innocent, informally adopts him, giving him new clothes and the promise of a good education. However, while out running an errand for Brownlow, Oliver is forcibly returned to the pickpocket gang by Faginâs associate, the evil [[Bill Sikes]], and the young prostitute [[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Nancy]] (who is in a complex and abusive relationship with Sikes). Fagin and Sikes worried that Oliver would "peach," and tell the authorities about their criminal activity. Oliver is put under supervision until Bill Sikes discovers the boyâs connection to the rich Mr. Brownlow. During midnight, Sikes and his accomplice, Toby Crackit, force Oliver to aid them in robbing Brownlowâs house. They are discovered and Oliver is wounded in a brief shootout between Brownlow and Sikes. As the three escape, Bill decides to murder Oliver to ensure his silence, but falls into a nearby river before he can take action.  Sikes survives his near-drowning, but is confined to bed with a heavy fever. Fagin, despite treating Oliver kindly, remains crime-focused and plots with Sikes to kill Oliver when Sikes has recovered. Nancy has a maternal love for Oliver and does not want to see him hurt, but she is controlled by the abusive Sikes. She drugs Bill, and goes to Brownlowâs house where she arranges to have him meet her on [[London Bridge]] at midnight so she can provide information about Oliver. At the meeting, Nancy cautiously reveals that Oliver is staying with Fagin, and that the authorities will easily find them. Brownlow leaves to call the police. The Artful Dodger, who had been sent by a suspicious Fagin to spy on Nancy, had heard everything and is bullied by Bill Sikes to give up the information. Sikes is furious at Nancyâs betrayal, and brutally beats her to death in their apartment.  The next day, information about Oliver and Fagin appear in the newspaper, along with Nancyâs murder and Sikes is a suspect. Sikesâs ever-present dog, Bullseye, is a dead giveaway to his identity. After unsuccessfully trying to kill the dog, Sikes takes up residence with Toby Crackit. Fagin, Oliver, and the boys are hiding there too, after escaping their previous location before the police could find it. Bullseye escapes his masterâs cruelty, and leads a group of police and locals to the groupâs hideout. Eventually, Dodger, outraged at Sikes for killing the good-hearted Nancy, reveals their location to authorities. Bill Sikes takes Oliver onto the roof, knowing they won't shoot if the boy is with him. When trying to scale the building using a rope, Sikes, distracted by his dog, loses his footing and accidentally hangs himself to death.  Some time later, Oliver is living comfortably with Mr. Brownlow again. Fagin was arrested for his pick pocketing actions, and Oliver wishes to visit him in jail. Brownlow takes him to the prison, where they find Fagin ranting and wailing in his cell. Oliver is distraught at Faginâs fate, as he had been something of a father figure to him. Oliver tells Fagin "You were kind to me," but soon, their bond breaks when a policeman initially tells Oliver to leave, thinking that Fagin can play tricks on the boy's innocent mind, and wanting to escape execution. As Mr. Brownlow escorts a tearful Oliver to his own carriage, [[gallows]] are being set up in the courtyard. Townspeople begin to gather to watch Faginâs execution, while Mr Brownlow and Oliver leave to start their new lives afresh.

Later, the school's vice principal, Duane Murney, informs Shane that Seth has cut and bleached his hair, has a Nazi armband in his locker, and has skipped every wrestling practice for a month.

Veerabhadran declares to the media that he will not negotiate with Malayappan and he will not give a single penny to the brigand. Malayappan realizes that he made a mistake by kidnapping the wrong person. Therefore, the cunning Tamizharasan suggests that Malayappan kidnap Veerabhadran's daughter and Malayappan follows his advice. Veerabhadran, who now wants to save his daughter at any cost, sends the popular news reporter Muthuvel ([[Vasu Vikram]]) to negotiate with the brigand in the forest. Thereafter, Malayappan releases Veerabhadran's daughter and a video of him killing Tamizharasan.  Following the fiasco, the [[Governors of states of India|governor of Tamil Nadu]] dismissed the current state government and Veerabhadran lost his Chief Minister post. Malayappan even gets a general amnesty and receives a government bungalow. Tamizharasan is indeed alive and that video of him being killed was a sham. Malayappan, who was hiding in the forests so far, is hailed by the people of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Thus Malayappan forms a political party after seeing his growing popularity. According to the survey, Malayappan has a good probability to become the new Chief Minister. Veerabhadran and Tamizharasan's party members then join Malayappan's party. In the end, the brigand cum politician Malayappan wins the election by a huge margin and becomes the new Chief Minister. In the meantime, Malayappan gets married to his lover Ponni (Anamika). Unlike the former Chief Ministers, Malayappan wants to help the people and starts his fight against corruption. What transpires next forms the crux of the story.  
Paheli
 The movie is narrated by two puppets, voiced by [[Naseeruddin Shah]] and [[Ratna Pathak Shah]].  Enthusiastic young Lachchi ([[Rani Mukerji]]) is to be married to Kishan ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]), the son of the rich merchant Bhanwarlal ([[Anupam Kher]]). Kishan is a dutiful son who honors his father's wish to start a new, far-away business on a predetermined auspicious date, which happens to be the day after the wedding ceremony. On the wedding night, Kishan turns away from his wife to finish his bookkeeping, and in the early morning hours sets off on a business trip that is to last five years. Lachchi is devastated; Gajrobai ([[Juhi Chawla]]), her husband's sister-in-law, consoles her, empathizing on the grounds that Gajrobai's husband Sunderlal ([[Sunil Shetty]]) has also disappeared. The next day, a ghost appears, having taken Kishan's shape and voice because of his own attachment to Lachchi.  Lachchi is thus presented a riddle (hence the title "paheli") between the representation of all of her desires in the form of the ghost and her real husband. She takes this new, fond, sexual, magical, social, self-confident version of Kishan as hers. As Kishan, the ghost befriends all of the real Kishan's family and keeps Bhanwarlal happy by providing him with magical, possibly illusory, gold [[coin]]s. His only blunder is in his treatment of the messenger Bhoja, who is perplexed by the idea that Kishan has sent a letter from his business trip only to receive it himself in his own house and offended when the ghost (who appears as Kishan) does not offer him a drink of water. Lachchi's bliss goes on until four years later, when she is pregnant and the real Kishan returns to see if the rumours about his wife's pregnancy are true. He returns to find the ghost in his (Kishan's) own form. Kishan's family is unable to determine which of the [[doppelganger]]s is the real Kishan (the ghost refusing to confess).  They decide to visit the king so that he can arbitrate.  On the way to the king they meet an old [[shepherd]] Gadariya ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) who helps them out. He asks the real son of Bhanwarlal to pick up hot coals, asks the real husband to gather the sheep, and asks Lachchi's real paramour to enter a water-bottle. The real Kishan is found out and everyone returns home. Lachchi is devastated over the loss of the ghost. In the very end it is revealed that the ghost has escaped the bottle and taken control of Kishan's body to live with her. By now Lachchi has given birth to a daughter, Looni Ma, by whom the ghost exposes his identity to Lachchi. The puppets close the story, remarking that the plot is "an old story".

He blames the Israelis for taking advantage of his father's weakness.  Khaled eventually finds Said, who is still wearing the belt and about to detonate it while lying on his father's grave. They return to the handlers, and Said convinces them that the attack need not be canceled, because he is ready for it.  They both travel to Tel Aviv.

Parineeta (2005 film)
 The story takes place in [[Kolkata]]. As the credits roll, scenes from erstwhile [[Calcutta]] are displayed along with the narrator's ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) introduction of the era. The narration focuses on the night of the marriage of Shekhar and Gayatri Tantiya, a rich industrialist's daughter. The audience is introduced to Naveen Roy as Shekhar's father while we see Shekhar grooming himself for the occasion. While he is doing so, images of Lalita calling him by his name flash through his mind. Downstairs, musical celebrations begin as Shekhar meets Vasundhara, a widow from his neighbourhood, who is thankful to her son-in-law, Girish ([[Sanjay Dutt]]), for supporting their family after the death of her husband, Gurcharan. Lalita, who is present there, playfully confronts Shekhar as to why he is being indifferent to her. Shekhar admonishes her for speaking so in spite of being married.  An angry Shekhar comes back home to play a favourite tune from the past on his piano. The flashback shows a young Shekhar playing [[Rabindranath Tagore]]âs tune on his piano while young Lalita and Koel are around. Lalita, with her parents having died in a car accident, lives with Gurcharanâs family. Koel is her cousin whereas Charu is her neighbour. As this scene flashes across Shekharâs mind, he sings a song full of sadness and loss. As time flies, they grow up to become close friends. The rebellious and musically inclined Shekhar spends his days playing the music of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] or [[Elvis Presley]] and composing his own songs with Lalita rather than becoming part of his shrewd father's business. Part of this rebellion involves resistance to meeting Gayatri Tantiya, the beautiful but devious daughter of a wealthy industrialist, whom his father would like Shekhar to marry. Meanwhile, Girish, a steel tycoon from London, makes a dramatic entry into Charuâs house. Girish seems smitten by Lalita while Koel is by Girish. Shekhar is visibly jealous of Lalitaâs close friendship with Girish.  One day, a shocked Lalita, who is employed at the Royâs office, remembers a hotel project from Gurcharanâs ancestral ''haveli'' (palatial house). On an earlier occasion, Gurcharan had borrowed money from Naveen Roy after putting his ''haveli'' on mortgage. She understands that if the money is not repaid in a few months, Naveen Roy would take over the property. She immediately thinks of asking Shekhar for monetary help. Unforeseen circumstances prevent this, and Girish, upon realising this, alleviates their problem by making Gurcharan his business partner. Gurcharan repays the debt and the turn of events prompts Shekhar to think why Lalita chose to ask Girish for money instead of him. On one auspicious night, Shekhar and Lalita exchange garlands and consummate their "marriage" unbeknownst to anyone else.  While Shekhar is off to [[Darjeeling]] on a business trip, Naveen Roy violently thunders at Lalita about the loss of his hotel project, embarrassing and humiliating her. Roy gets a wall built between his and Gurcharanâs house symbolising the end of their association. Gurcharan, unable to digest this, suffers a heart attack. Upon Shekharâs return, Roy informs him of the ill-health of his mother and Gurcharan viciously adds a note of Lalita and Girishâs marriage. Shekhar is disgusted to hear of the marriage and in his anger he scowls at Lalita, humiliating her like his father. Meanwhile, Girish assists Gurcharan's family and takes them to London for the heart treatment. Misunderstandings follow and upon the familyâs return from London, Shekhar assumes that Girish and Lalita are married and agrees to marry Gayatri. The film returns to the night of Shekharâs marriage when Girish hands him the ownership papers of Gurcharanâs ''haveli''. He shocks Shekhar by telling him that he got married to Koel because Lalita denied his marriage proposal. As a conclusion, Shekhar confronts his father and symbolically breaks down the wall separating the two families. He then brings Lalita to his home as his bride much to the delight of his mother.

Norrington has resigned and disappeared after losing the Navy's flagship, the HMS ''Dauntless'', in a hurricane while pursuing Jack. Meanwhile, Jack is visited by Will's father, [[Bootstrap Bill Turner]], aboard the ''[[Black Pearl]]''. Bootstrap is now a crewman on the ''[[Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]'', captained by [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]]. Jack previously bartered a deal with Jones to raise the ''Pearl'' from the depths; now Jack must join Jones' crew or be dragged to [[List of locations in Pirates of the Caribbean#Davy Jones' Locker|Davy Jones' Locker]] by the [[Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken]]. Beckett, meanwhile, promises to free Elizabeth if Will brings him Jack's magic compass which points to whatever the holder wants most.

Shortly after, [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Governor Swann|Governor Swann]] frees Elizabeth from jail, but he is then captured. Elizabeth bargains with Beckett to find the compass. Disguised as a cabin boy aboard a Scottish merchant vessel, she makes her way to Tortuga where she later finds Jack and also a drunken Norrington. After escaping the cannibals, Jack and the crew visit [[wikt:voodoo|voodoo]] priestess [[Tia Dalma]], who reveals Jones' weakness is his heart, which is locked within the Dead Man's Chest. Jack must find it and the key that opens it. Locating the ''Dutchman'', Will makes a deal with Jack to find the key to the chest in return for Jack's compass. Jack tricks Will, who is [[Shanghaiing|shanghaied]] into service aboard the ''Dutchman''. Jones agrees to release Jack from their bargain in exchange for one hundred souls. Will meets his father aboard the ''Dutchman'' and learns that Jones possesses the key to the chest. They play a game of ''Liar's Dice'' against Jones to try and win the key, but they lose. Despite this, Will escapes with the key and is taken aboard the same ship Elizabeth was on. Jones sends the Kraken after him, sinking the ship, but Will escapes.  In [[List of locations in Pirates of the Caribbean#Tortuga|Tortuga]], Jack hires a new crew, including Elizabeth and Norrington. With Elizabeth's use of Jack's compass, they are able to locate the chest. All parties arrive on [[List of locations in Pirates of the Caribbean#Isla Cruces|Isla Cruces]], where the chest is buried, but a three-way sword fight breaks out between Jack, Will, and Norrington, who all want the heart for their respective goals: Jack wants to call off the Kraken; Will wants to rescue his father; and Norrington wants to regain his life as a Navy officer. In the chaos, Norrington secretly steals the heart and runs off, pretending to lure away the ''Dutchman''s crew. Jones attacks the ''Pearl'' with the Kraken, which devours most of the crew and destroys all but one of the ''Pearl''s lifeboats, but Jack, who briefly flees the battle, returns and wounds the Kraken with a net full of gunpowder and rum.  Jack orders the survivors to abandon ship, but Elizabeth, realizing the Kraken only wants Jack, tricks him and chains him to the mast so that the crew can escape. The Kraken drags Jack and the ''Pearl'' to Davy Jones' Locker. Jones opens the chest to discover his heart is gone. In Port Royal, Norrington gives Beckett the heart and the [[Letters of Marque]] meant for Jack, allowing him back into the navy as well as allowing Beckett to gain control of Davy Jones and the seas. The ''Pearl''s crew take shelter with Tia Dalma, where they all agree to rescue Jack. Tia Dalma introduces the captain who will guide them: the resurrected [[Hector Barbossa]].  In a [[post-credits scene]], the cannibalistic tribe now worships the prison dog in replacement of Jack.  
PokÃ©mon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew
 In the legendary past, before the creation of PokÃ© Balls, an Aura-guiding PokÃ©mon called [[Lucario]] senses two rival armies about to clash near Cameran Palace in the [[PokÃ©mon universe#Kanto|Kanto]] region. He telepathically informs his master, Sir Aaron, through a nearby crystal just before being attacked by three Houndoom. During the battle, Lucario is temporarily [[Blindness|blinded]], but is still able to use his Aura Sphere to defeat the Houndoom - sensing their movements with his Aura abilities. The Queen of Cameran, Lady Rin, decides it is right to die with her people, so Aaron leaves on his Pidgeot to meet up with Lucario, but is attacked by a rival group of Skarmory on the way. Aaron tells Lucario that he is leaving and will not be coming back, and when Lucario tries to follow him, he is automatically sealed in Aaron's staff. The Tree of Beginning then shines a bright light covering the land; stopping the war, and the queen realizes that Aaron must have sacrificed himself by using his own Aura to transform the armies' hatred into mutual understanding. Since then, he was hailed as a hero, and only his staff remained for his legacy.  Around one thousand years later, [[Ash Ketchum]], his partner PokÃ©mon [[Pikachu]], and their travelling companions [[Brock (PokÃ©mon)|Brock]], [[List of PokÃ©mon anime characters#Protagonists|May]] and [[List of PokÃ©mon anime characters#Protagonists|Max]] arrive at Cameran Palace to celebrate the life of Sir Aaron. Ash competes in a PokÃ©mon battle tournament, and wins against Kidd Summers and her [[List of generation IV PokÃ©mon#Weavile|Weavile]]. That night, there is a royal [[Ball (dance)|ball]], and as the winner of the tournament, Ash is rewarded with the title of "Hero of the Year" and the privilege to hold Aaron's staff. [[Team Rocket]] join the dance too, but [[Meowth]] runs off to follow Kidd. She reveals herself as an agent explorer, performing research on Mew, who is known to appear at the palace, and Meowth presumes that she is a villain. Ash and May's PokÃ©mon run off into the attic of the palace to play. However, Kidd's two Weavile attack when Mew joins in. As Max watches through a crack in the door, Mew teleports Pikachu and Meowth onto the roof of the castle, before transforming into a Pidgeot and flying away with them. In the ballroom, Ash watches the [[fireworks]] display. However, Ash begins to hear a voice coming from the crystal on his staff. The crystal begins to glow, and Lucario is freed from the staff due to Ash's Aura having a close resemblance to Aaron's. Lucario is very confused about what has happened since the time he was sealed, and goes to search for answers.  Max informs the rest of the group on what happened, while Team Rocket overhear him. Lady Ilene, the current queen, says Mew has a tradition of showing up at the palace and taking toys to its home at the Tree of Beginning. Ash and his friends begin to work with Kidd after Brock finally realizes she is famous and not a villain at all. The group head off to the Tree of Beginning with the help of Lucario, with Team Rocket following by hiding in Kidd's trunk. On their journey, they find a Time Flower (which allows the finder to look at images of the past) and meet a [[List of generation IV PokÃ©mon#Bonsly|Bonsly]] which hitches a ride with the group. That night, Ash recalls how much he and Pikachu have been through, such as on their first day together when a flock of Spearow attacked him, and Pikachu leaped to save Ash. Lucario scoffs at the story, saying humans can never be trusted after his apparent betrayal by Sir Aaron in the past. Ash gets angry at this and tackles Lucario, but ends up losing the brawl. Max tries to cheer the PokÃ©mon up with some [[chocolate]], which Lucario is unfamiliar with.  The next morning, Lucario encounters the same area where he was sealed in the staff. A Time Flower projects the moment, showing Sir Aaron trapping Lucario and flying away, making everyone believe Lucario in saying that he was, indeed, betrayed. Ash apologizes to Lucario for his previous behavior and cries shamefully; Lucario, forgiving him, asks Ash to promise that he will not desert Pikachu. At that moment, a [[List of generation III PokÃ©mon#Regirock|Regirock]] attacks, and everyone runs into the Tree of Beginning. Ash and Lucario split up, with May, Max, Brock, and Kidd heading a different direction. Ash ends up getting attacked by a [[List of generation III PokÃ©mon#Regice|Regice]] that blocks their path, so he and Lucario decide to backtrack. Meanwhile, everyone else is attacked by a [[List of generation III PokÃ©mon#Registeel|Registeel]], and red blob "antibodies" produced by the Tree begin devouring May, Max, Brock, and Team Rocket as if they are a disease.  Ash finally reunites with Pikachu and meets up with Meowth and Kidd, who are the only members of the group left. Soon, Ash and Kidd get attacked as well, after sending their PokÃ©mon out to safety, while Registeel stops Lucario from saving them. All of Ash's PokÃ©mon cry over their Trainers' apparent deaths. However, Mew decides to talk with the Tree, using its powers to inform the Tree that humans aren't trying to harm it. Eventually, this works, and everyone is brought back; however, after its performance, Mew becomes badly ill. Finding that the Tree is dying due to its immune system going into shock, Ash, Kidd, Mew, and Lucario run into the heart of the Tree. They find a crystal with Sir Aaron in suspended animation, and a Time Flower showing that the legend was true - Aaron actually used his Aura to end the ancient war, at the cost of his life.  Lucario realizes that he can also restore the Tree by using his Aura powers. Due to his similar Aura, Ash uses Aaron's gloves to help complete the procedure, despite both knowing they will die as a result. As the Aura Sphere gets larger and much more powerful, Lucario knocks Ash back and demands to finish the rest. The Tree and Mew are restored back to health, but Lucario only has little time left. A Time Flower is found once again, showing Sir Aaron saying goodbye to Lucario as he dies. Aaron is seen sharing that Lucario was more than his pupil, he was his closest friend, and that he hopes to meet Lucario again someday. Lucario begins to cry at seeing his master's final image, apologzing for failing his master. Ash holds Lucario's paws and says that he proved to be as good a Guardian of Aura as Sir Aaron. Lucario finally passes away, thanking Ash for the encouragement, while knowing that Sir Aaron is waiting for him. Kidd decides the Tree's mystery should be kept secret to prevent tourism.  Ash and Kidd meet May, Brock, and Max outside, who realize Lucario is not with them. After explaining the situation, Brock mentions it is hard to believe Lucario is gone, but Ash says "No, Lucario isn't gone... his Aura is with me."  In the credits sequence, it is shown that Ash and friends return to the palace and are rewarded by Lady Ilene, while the portrait of Sir Aaron at the castle is updated to include Lucario. Lucario and Sir Aaron share a chocolate bar in their distant place after death, while Kidd leaves the group and meets with [[PokÃ©mon: JirachiâWish Maker|Butler and Diane]], and Ash and his friends continue on their journey in the Kanto region.

Here Darcy shows greater interest in Elizabeth. The next day, not realizing that Jane is Elizabeth's sister, Colonel Fitzwilliam lets slip to Elizabeth that Darcy had separated Bingley from Jane. Distraught, she flees outside, but Darcy chooses that moment to track her down and propose marriage.  He says he loves her "most ardently" despite her "lower rank." Elizabeth refuses him, citing his treatment of Jane, Bingley, and Wickham; they argue fiercely, with Darcy explaining that he had been convinced that Jane did not return Bingley's love. Darcy leaves angry and heartbroken. He finds Elizabeth later and presents her with a letter, which explains that Wickham is a gambler who demanded and received Â£3,000 in cash in-lieu of the clergy position intended for him by Darcy's father; upon being refused more money, after having squandered it all a few years later, Wickham attempted to seduce and elope with Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, to obtain her Â£30,000 inheritance but abandoned her upon learning that he would never receive the money.  A couple of months later, the Gardiners take Elizabeth on a trip to the [[Peak District]]; their visit also includes Darcy's estate, [[Pemberley]]; Elizabeth agrees to go with them, believing he is in London. Elizabeth is impresssed by its wealth and beauty and hears nothing but good things about Darcy from his housekeeper. There, she accidentally runs into Darcy who has arrived home early. He invites her and the Gardiners to meet his sister. His manners have softened considerably, and Georgiana takes an instant liking to Elizabeth. When Elizabeth learns that her immature and flirtatious youngest sister Lydia has run away with Wickham, she tearfully blurts out the news to Darcy and the Gardiners before returning home. Her family expects social ruin for having a disgraced daughter, but over a week later they are relieved to hear that Mr. Gardiner had discovered the pair in London and that they had married. Lydia later slips to Elizabeth that Darcy was the one who found them and paid for the marriage.  When Bingley and Darcy suddenly return to Netherfield, Jane accepts Bingley's proposal. The same evening, Lady Catherine unexpectedly visits Elizabeth, insisting she renounce Darcy as he is supposedly to marry her own daughter, Anne. Elizabeth refuses and, unable to sleep, walks on the moor at dawn. There, she meets Darcy, also unable to sleep after hearing of his aunt's behaviour. He admits his continued love and Elizabeth accepts his proposal.  Mr. Bennet gives his consent after Elizabeth assures him of her love for Darcy. In the U.S. release of the film, an additional last scene shows the newlyweds outside at Pemberley, happy together.

The school drama teacher, Percy Anderson, orders Kimberly and Randa to after-school detention one day for disrupting class, and forces Kimberly to write an essay reflecting on her transgression. Percy takes the essay home that evening and has his wife, Grace, read it aloud provocatively as a [[Sexual roleplay|role play]] before the two engage in sex. After Brittany is publicly humiliated by Percy during an acting exercise, Kimberly devises a plan to accuse him of [[sexual harassment|sexually harassing]] each of them. Unable to afford an attorney, Percy agrees to his friend Roger a clueless high school law teacher who passed the bar acting as his attorney. In court, Roger proposes that the accusations are in retaliation to Kimberly having been replaced in the school play after referring to her Jewish classmate Josh's lawyer father as a "money-grubbing [[shyster]]."  The case becomes a media sensation covered extensively by Emily Klein, a local [[lesbian]] reporter. Shortly after the trial begins, Kimberly has a sexual encounter with Emily. She manipulates Josh with [[oral sex]] into convincing his father Larry, a renowned defense attorney, to defend Percy ''[[pro bono]]''. When Larry cross examines Brittany, she confesses on the stand that she, Kimberly, and Randa fabricated the accusations. When Emily confronts her outside the courthouse, Kimberly reveals she filmed their sexual encounter, and uses it as [[blackmail]] to receive favorable press coverage.  Overwhelmed with the shame brought on her family by the false accusations, Randa shoots herself to death at school. Grace, now aware the essay Percy had her read was written by Kimberly, leaves him. In the storm of media coverage, Emily extolls Kimberly as a mere "victim" of society, and the ensuing press incites Hollywood producers to give Kimberly a [[bit part]] on a daytime [[soap opera]].   When Brittany visits Kimberly at her house, Kimberly reveals she manipulated Josh into having his father defend Percy as she knew it would cause Brittany to buckle under pressure in court. When Brittany asks why, Kimberly explains that she devised the calculated plot to garner publicity for herself, as well as exact revenge against Brittany for having stolen her ex-boyfriend, Troy. Brittany lambasts her and leaves, vowing never to speak to her again. Kimberly turns on the television and sees herself on the episode of the soap opera. As she watches herself onscreen, tears begin streaming down her face.

The President's Last Bang
 At a luxurious brothel in South Korea, [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|KCIA]] Chief Agent Ju deals with the mother of a young woman who was one of South Korean president Park Chung-hee's playmates, who has come with her daughter to offer her again to the President, by interrogating and intimidating them.   [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|KCIA]] director Kim gets scolded by a doctor about his drinking, a direct result of having to attend President Park's drinking parties. Scenes of various officials and low officers making their way to a heavily guarded safehouse follow, including Chief Agent Ju procuring an attractive young woman and the famous [[enka]] and [[Trot (music)|trot]] singer [[Sim Soo-bong]] for the party.  During the dinner, President Park, his personal bodyguard, Cha Ji-cheol, Director Kim, Chief Secretary Yang (appointed to the post to be Park's drinking buddy, and portrayed as a total sycophant) discuss how to deal with demonstrators, with Cha berating Kim for not being repressive enough. Kim, having been agitated the entire day, decides then to kill Park, and hatches the plan with Chief Agent Ju and KCIA Colonel Min.   Director Kim returns to the party, shoots Cha (who is unarmed) and Park, each with a single shot before jamming the pistol. Soon thereafter, Agent Ju and Col. Min and a few minions kill the president's personal bodyguards and secure the building. Kim comes back with another gun, finishes off Cha, and gives Park his personal opinion before executing him with a shot to the head.   They move to make the scene resemble an ambush by North Korean forces, and Kim uses the political fear and tension to his advantage while convening a Cabinet Council. Later, Director Kim and Colonel Min meet with the Army higher-ups to sell them their version of events, but Chief Secretary Yang gets to them first and tells what really happened.  With every agency under its own authority and the possibility of inter-agency war looming, the Army arrests Director Kim, leaving Agent Yu and Colonel Min helpless and confused. Realizing their fate, they call their families to say goodbye.   Prime Minister [[Choi Kyu-hah]] ascends to the presidency, and the fates of those involved at the party - most of them executed - are listed.

The killings continue, with Soon-jung out to punish everyone whom she believes played a role in her young child's death. Soon-jung eventually allows herself to be captured, in order to complete the final act of her revenge.<ref></ref>   
Prey Alone
  The film opens with an explosion at the far end of a subway. From the point of the explosion, we see  a black [[Aston Martin DB7]] speeding towards the screen; it stops as the camera circles to show the route has been cut off by police vehicles. Out of breath, the silhouetted man takes off his dog tag and looks at a black gun lying in the passenger seat beside him. The screen fades to the title.  After the introduction the movie opens with [[National Security Agency|NSA]] Special Agent Darris Cain (Ger Carey) in an [[elevator]] that is going to "Level One" of a [[military prison]] as radio chatter says "...we think it's starting again, have we got an inmate down there by the name of Dean Ellis?". Cain is there to interrogate the reluctant and taunting [[witness]] with a [[mouth]] [[injury]], Dean Ellis (Andy Moore). Evidence gathered through surveillance shows Ellis meeting with an elusive fugitive (Kurt Savage) whom Cain has been tracking around the world. The only lead is Ellis and a notebook with the words "Prey Alone" written in it, which was in Ellis's [[personal effects]]. Cain tries to extract information about the fugitive, only to be stymied by Ellis's laugh and taunts. Ellis prods Cain to think about what is happening, and hints that this event is happening over and over, like a [[dÃ©jÃ  vu]] event. Soon, Cain realizes "Prey Alone" is actually a [[phone number]] and leaves to coordinate an attempt to capture the fugitive.  The phone number is tracked to a cell phone located in a room in a nondescript building in the city and forces are mobilized. A watch on both the fugitive and Cain's wrists start counting down from 10:00 minutes. As a [[SWAT]] team is about to break into the room, the fugitive sets off an explosive that was placed on the door by the SWAT team. All of the team except for one member is killed or rendered harmless. The fugitive escapes the room after the explosion and shoots the last one in the back of the head.  A second SWAT team stands by at the [[elevator]] of the building. They see the floor numbers counting down and ready their [[automatic weapons]]. The elevator opens and nobody seems to be inside. The team enters the elevator and peers up, only to see a hole in the roof and a [[grenade]] coming down that hole. The grenade explodes and the team is incapacitated.  The rest of the force attempts to seal the building, but the fugitive escapes in a black car. He sets off in a high-speed chase down the [[highway]] with the [[police]] in multiple cars and a helicopter chasing after him. He shoots one police car and disables it, which blocks the highway for the rest of the cars. Then, the fugitive shoots at the helicopter and  kills the pilots. Some military personnel that are present in the control room where Cain is located urge Cain to back off. He declines and orders a technician to call up a nearby [[Andrews Air Force Base]] and tell them to send in two aircraft to chase the car.  Cain reenters the interrogation room where Ellis is still being held. Ellis laughs at Cain, and gets punched in the mouth. Cain tries to get Ellis to tell him where the fugitive is running to, but Ellis indicates that the fugitive is not running. Again, Ellis prods Cain to think, and Cain finally realizes this is a recurring event. He connects the pain in Ellis's mouth to the punch that he just delivered. With this piece of information, Cain realizes that he knows where the fugitive is going because it is all happening again.  The fugitive is heading to an incomplete subway. Cain tries to get the aircraft to pull out, but it is too late and they disappear off the radar screen. Cain pulls up a map of the subway and orders reinforcements to seal off certain tunnels.  The aircraft have entered into the tunnel, which is the reason why they disappeared off the radar screen. One of the jets is hit and is forced to fly off the main tunnel and into another one. It eventually crashes into a wall. The second airplane is able to arm and lock a [[missile]]. The fugitive attempts [[evasive maneuvers]] in his car to try to throw the missile off and is successful. The missile continues flying and tries to reacquire a target. It does so, but it targets the second jet. The jet is hit and destroyed.  The fugitive begins to exit the tunnel, but stops abruptly when he sees a police force blocking his way. It becomes clear that the fugitive was the silhouetted man at the beginning, and is once again trapped in the tunnel. Cain shows up in a helicopter with a line of other SWAT officers and they tell the fugitive to surrender. The fugitive speeds towards the SWAT officers but stops when they open fire.  Cain and the officers walk over to the car only to find dog tags that say "Player One." On the ground is a traffic marker that says "End of Level One." Cain looks at his watch and as the seconds count down to 0:00, Cain realizes that this is all a game.  At 0:00, the words "Game Over" flash momentarily on the screen.  Once again we see Cain in an elevator as the voices over the radio say "we think it's starting again". The movie ends as Cain walks by the same sign from the beginning stating "You are now entering...Level One."

They have a shared hatred toward the immigrant prostitutes they observe from the salon. This is because some of them (including Caye) are also prostitutes and feel the immigrants take clients (and ultimately business and money) from them.  Cayeâs point of view is quickly changed when she meets Zulema ([[Micaela NevÃ¡rez]]), an illegal immigrant prostitute working to send money home to her mother and son Edward she left in the [[Dominican Republic]].

Zulema approaches Caye and tells her about a man who has promised her papers that will legalize her status in Spain and allow her to bring her family  to Spain. Caye suspicious of the offer and begs Zulema not to go with him. Cayeâs theory proves true, the man wishes simply to use Zulema and never had intentions of actually getting her legal status. She escapes a first meeting with him when Caye comes to help, but is later lured into a hotel room, where the client turns out to be him, and she is left beaten and presumably raped.  Zulema then has a consensual tryst with a compassionate "volunteer" and goes to the hospital for a full medical examination, something she hadn't done for many years. When Zulema sees the test results, she collapses. Actual confirmation of her medical status is left ambiguous although there is a hint that her condition is fatal and communicable as she intentionally arranges to meet with her abuser and has rough sex with him.  While at the hospital with Zulema, Caye receives a call from a client requesting her services for himself and his friends. Caye heads to the cafe where they have arranged to meet. There she runs into Manuel and a group of his co-workers only to realize that it was Manuel and his friends who are requesting her services and learns of Manuelâs presumed infidelity. Manuel meanwhile realizes that Caye was indeed being serious about her profession, without saying a word to each other, they both understand the predicament and quietly go their separate ways.  Devastated over her newfound situation, Zulema decides to leave Spain and return to her family in the Dominican Republic. With a heartfelt but bittersweet good-bye, Caye gives Zulema an envelope filled with cash and asks her to âgo be happyâ. That afternoon while having dinner with her family, Caye announces that Zulema has returned to the Dominican Republic because she was a prostitute and could no longer bear the emotional burden of the profession and distance from her son. The film concludes with Cayeâs cellphone again incessantly ringing, her mom asking her whether she is going to answer or not and Caye simply retorting, âÂ¡CÃ³gelo tÃº mamÃ¡!â ("You answer it, mom").

Proof (2005 film)
 The plot alternates between events immediately following the death of Robert ([[Anthony Hopkins]]), a brilliant mathematician whose genius was undone by crippling mental illness, and flashbacks revealing the life he shared with his daughter Catherine ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]).  Catherine is also a mathematician, but she struggles with living in her father's shadow, with balancing her demanding studies with caring for her father and also with the fear that she may have inherited his mental illness.  At home, Robert clings to sanity by constantly bombarding Catherine with complex mathematical problems.  In the opening scene Robert startles Catherine while she watches TV in the middle of the night. He gives her a bottle of champagne for her birthday, and they chat for a while about the nature of [[insanity]], ending with the revelation that Robert died last week and his funeral is tomorrow.  Awakened from this dream, Catherine realizes that Hal ([[Jake Gyllenhaal]]), a former [[graduate student]] of Robert's, is still upstairs, reading through Robert's books. Robert filled many notebooks with meaningless notes.  Hal believes that Robert's genius may have withstood his illness, and clues to that genius might lie among the gibberish of his notebooks. When Hal comments on the vast amount of work Robert did, a suspicious Catherine searches Hal's backpack.  Though Catherine finds nothing in Hal's bag,  a notebook falls out of his coat. He explains that he wanted to give the notebook as a birthday present because it "had something written in it about her, not math, her". Hal is forced to leave, giving the notebook as intended, when Catherine calls the police.  The next day, for the funeral, Catherine's sister Claire ([[Hope Davis]]) arrives in town. A huge contrast to the unkempt Catherine, Claire is an overly put together, neurotic [[New York City|New Yorker]]. Relations between the sisters are tense, and Catherine cannot stand her sister's constant harping on matters of appearance. Catherine is also upset that Claire didn't care for her father as much as Catherine did in his final years.  At the funeral, Catherine expresses her frustration with the many people there. She interrupts the string quartet with an impromptu speech, berating everyone for not being there for her father while he was alive. She describes his descent into insanity, and that at one time he would borrow piles of books believing that aliens were sending him messages encoded in their Dewey Decimal codes.  She ends by saying she's glad her father is dead and walks out of the church mid-funeral.  Claire decides to sell Robert's house back to the university and wants Catherine to come with her to New York; Catherine is upset that she will be forced to leave the house. It becomes evident that Claire suspects that Catherine may be struggling with mental illnesses, as their father had. A [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] held at the house the night after the funeral, is attended by many academic mathematicians.  Hal appears and chats up Catherine.  Softening up to Hal, Catherine sleeps with him.  Afterwards, she gives the student a key to her father's desk.  In flashbacks, Robert is shown suddenly invigorated, believing he has seen the beginnings of a new mathematical proof that will prove his triumph over mental illness.  In the present, Hal finds a notebook in Robert's desk, which itself contains a lengthy but apparently very important [[mathematical proof|proof]]. He is very excited and shows the discovery to Catherine and Claire. He asks Catherine how long she knew about this and why she did not tell him about it. She tells him that she wrote it. Catherine claims the work is [[Academic authorship|hers and not her father's]] despite evidence to the contrary.  Neither Hal nor Claire believe Catherine.  Hal believes the mathematics of the proof are beyond Catherine, while Claire simply suspects that Catherine is suffering the onset of mental illness.  Catherine can't describe the proof without the notebook because it "is not a muffin recipe". Hal decides to take it to the math department the next day to verify the proof's accuracy.  He returns as Claire and Catherine are leaving, with news that the math department believes the proof to be valid. Hal tells Claire that he doesn't think that her father wrote the proof because it employs newer mathematics and wants Catherine to explain it to him sometime. Catherine remains stung by his earlier lack of trust, and the sisters leave for the airport; but, Hal sprints after the car and throws the book through the window and onto Catherine's lap.  At the airport, Catherine has another flashback. It is revealed that, while living together, her father challenged her to work on math, which she does, ultimately completing a proof, which she describes in one of the many notebooks in the house. Catherine goes to tell her father about the breakthrough, but he insists she read aloud the proof that he is working on. To Catherine's disappointment, Robert's notebook contains not a proof, but a rambling and desperate observation of the passage of the seasons, that the year is divided into months of cold, months of warmth and months of indeterminate temperature, that the future of heat is the future of cold, that the future of cold is infinite, and that he will never be as cold as he will be in the future.  Reading her father's work, Catherine realizes that Robert has not overcome his mental illness. A dispirited Catherine leaves her notebook in Robert's desk, where Hal will later find it.  Catherine has begun to come to terms with herself, aided by Hal's confidence in her. She decides that she does not need to go with her sister to New York and runs out of the airport. She returns to [[University of Chicago]], and the film ends with her and Hal meeting up on campus and discussing the proof.  
The Producers (2005 film)
 Following the flop of theatre musical ''Funny Boy'' (based on [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'') ("Opening Night"), the show's washed-up producer, [[Max Bialystock]], hires the neurotic [[Leo Bloom]] as his accountant. While studying Max's books, Leo notes that as a flop is expected to lose money, the [[IRS]] will not investigate the finances of failed productions. Leo jests that by selling an excess of shares and [[Embezzlement|embezzling]] the funds, a flop could generate up to $2 million. Max asks for Leo's help with the scheme, only for the latter to refuse ("We Can Do It").  Returning to his old accounting firm, Leo starts fantasizing about being a Broadway producer ("I Wanna Be a Producer"). Leo quits his job and forms "Bialystock & Bloom" with Max. Searching for the worst play ever written, the duo finds ''[[Springtime for Hitler]]'', a musical written by an ex-[[Nazi]] named [[Franz Liebkind]]. Max and Leo, in order to acquire Franz's rights to the musical, perform Hitler's favorite song and swear the sacred "Siegfried Oath" to him ("Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop").  In order to ensure the play's failure, Max and Leo meet failing, [[Flamboyancy|flamboyant]] director [[Roger De Bris]] and his assistant [[Carmen Ghia]]. Roger is reluctant to direct, but when Max and Leo suggest he could win a [[Tony Award]], he agrees on the condition that the play be more [[Camp (style)|"gay"]] ("Keep It Gay"). Back at their office, a Swedish woman named [[Ulla (The Producers)|Ulla]] appears to audition. Although Leo points out that they have not started casting, Max hires her as their secretary until they audition her later ("When You've Got It, Flaunt It").  To gain backers to fund the musical, Max has dalliances with several elderly women ("Along Came Bialy"), allowing him to raise the $2 million. Leo laments about the dangers of sex distracting him from his work, and shares a kiss with Ulla ("That Face"). At auditions for the role of Hitler, Franz, angered at a performer's rendition of a German song, storms the stage and performs it himself ("Haben Sie gehÃ¶rt das Deutsche Band?"). Based on the performance, Max hires Franz to play Hitler.  On opening night, as the cast and crew prepare to go on stage, Leo wishes everyone good luck, to which everyone warns it is bad luck to say "good luck" on opening night, and that the correct phrase is to say "break a leg" ("You Never Say Good Luck on Opening Night"). Franz leaves to prepare and breaks his leg. Max enlists Roger to perform the role in his place, and Roger accepts.  As the show opens, the audience is horrified at the first song ("[[Springtime for Hitler (song)|Springtime for Hitler]]"), and people begin leaving out of disgust until Roger enters as Hitler. Roger, playing Hitler very flamboyantly, causes the audience to misinterpret the play as [[satire]], resulting in the show becoming a smash. Terrified the IRS will learn of their crimes, a dispute breaks out between Max and Leo. Franz then appears and attempts to shoot the duo for breaking the Siegfried Oath by mocking Hitler, only to attract the police. As Max and Franz attempt to evade the police, Franz breaks his other leg.  Arrested for his tax fraud, Max is imprisoned while Leo elopes with Ulla to [[Rio de Janeiro]] ("Betrayed"). About to be sentenced, Max is saved by Leo, who returns to defend him ("Til Him"). The judge, realizing Max and Leo are inseparable, sentences them both to five years at [[Sing Sing|Sing Sing Prison]] with Franz. Writing and producing a new musical in prison ("Prisoners of Love"), Leo, Max, and Franz are pardoned by the governor for their work, allowing them to collaborate with Roger and Ulla and release ''Prisoners of Love''. The play's success means Max and Leo go on to become successful Broadway producers.  In a [[post-credits scene]], the cast sings "Goodbye!", telling the audience to leave the theater.  
The Prophecy: Forsaken
  The movie opens  with a brief flashback to the previous film as Father Constantine finds the Lexicon -  the final book of God's prophecy and its continuing to write itself - in the catacombs of his church. When he keels over from a heart attack, now itâs up to a grad student, Allison ([[Kari WÃ¼hrer]], reprising her role), to keep it from the forces of darkness.  Cut to the streets of [[Bucharest]]. A young girl named Maria loses her ball into the busy street. Suddenly, Lucifer (reprised by [[John Light (actor)|John Light]]) appears to her and tells her she should go get it. Almost trancelike, she wanders into the street and as a result is run over by a vehicle. Allison witnesses the whole thing and runs to the little girl's side. The girl tells Allison she has a message for herâbut she cannot give it to her yet.  On her way down, Allison brushed into Dylan ([[Jason Scott Lee]]) who was standing at the entrance to her apartment building. We next see him sitting in a dark room assembling and loading his gun. A mysterious figure named Stark ([[Tony Todd]]) behind him discusses "the job" he was hired to doâkill Allison. Dylan tries to take the noble route and shoots himself in the head rather than take another life. Not to be discourage, Stark brings Dylan back to life on the spot and tells him that the brief taste of hell he just tasted should convince him to work for Stark.  Dylan breaks into Allison's house and holds her at gunpoint, and tells her that he was hired to do a job, but something is telling him that she is different. She was meant to live. He wants to know why she should live. She responds by saying that she has been entrusted with a responsibility, but she will not say what it is. Torn between doing the right thing and doing his job, Dylan kidnaps Allison and takes her with him. Stark breaks into the apartment a short time later; he tears the place apart and finds the Lexicon. Yet, it is only a decoyâa set of magazine articles bound together in the Lexicon's cover.  Dylan takes Allison to his "friend" Gabriella's house to get her a wig, some perfume, and some iron pills. The iron pills change the taste of her blood and the perfume changes her smell. Angels hunt by smell and taste (according to the first ''[[The Prophecy]]'' film). As they are escaping from a group of angels, Dylan explains the angel hierarchyâCherubim and seraphim are the most dangerous. He then sends her on her way and goes back to fight a hopeless battle to buy her time. The perfume and iron pills do the trick; Allison is able to escape. Stark's drones capture Dylan and bring him before Stark. Stark claims to Dylan that Allison is going to start genocide the likes of which the world has never seen, so Dylan should have killed her when he had the chance.  Allison goes to the only "person" she can â [[Lucifer]].  He explains that the Lexicon is going to name the Antichrist in a matter of hours. The angels in Heaven do not want that kind of information falling into the hands of the wrong people. However, there are laws in Heaven against killing people, hence the hired assassin. Unfortunately, for Heaven, Allison turned their hired gun before he could finish the job. He then tells her that he will not get involved in this one, in spite the fact that he already had.  When Allison comes out of his rickety old mansion, there are two angels waiting to take her. She races across the field until she comes upon a funeral processionâfor the young girl Maria, who Lucifer sent to her death in the opening. The angels lose track of her in the crowd. The procession ends at an old church, which is safe ground for Allison. Meanwhile, Stark continues to torture Dylan because he still needs him, especially since Allison trusts Dylan now. Stark tells Dylan to get her out of the church, and they will take care of the rest.  Back inside the church, Allison hears the voice of the little girl calling to her: she says that she feels so cold, and tells her that the "bad angels" do not want us in Heaven. They are trying to keep us out, so she cannot let them have the book, no matter what. Dylan shows up at the church and stays with Allison through the night; he asks her if she is sure that she is on the right side in this war. Allison claims that "you have to take some things on faith". Dylan takes a look outside and sees dozens of angels waiting for them; worried, he feels that they must get out of there soon or else there will be hundreds by the morning. Thus, he tells Allison to wait for his signal and then run directly to his car. When she gets there, though, he has locked her out; the double-cross is complete.  The angels capture Allison and bring her before Stark; he tells her that he is against the whole messy idea of [[Armageddon]]. If they can find the name of the Antichrist, they can kill the child before the apocalypse and save humanity. Allison claims she's not keen on the idea of going over God's head, and she doesn't think he is either or she'd already be dead. Stark promises to kill her if he has to; however, he lets her leave for now.  As Allison leaves, she runs into Lucifer in the park; he helps her reason through what has happened. Stark and a few of the other seraphim aren't happy with the idea of Armageddon. After all, it means Heaven will be flooded with humans, beloved by God above even the seraphim themselves. Of course, Lucifer likes the idea of Armageddon because it will mean that a billion new corrupt souls will appear on his doorstep.  She leaves to check on the Lexicon's hiding place, but she's attacked by a homeless man. A voice whispers to her that it is time to fight back; that is just what she does - she fights off the homeless man and snaps his neck. However, Stark and Dylan have already figured out where she has hidden it as Dylan remembered that she used to take a walk through the same park every day. Stark says she would have gone that way to check on the Lexicon, and thus they head to an abandoned house that Stark theorizes contains the Lexicon.  Allison sees them heading for the house and breaks in through the cellar. The Lexicon has finished its task of writing the name of the AntichristâMykael Paun, and he shall bear four distinct marks on his face. Allison grabs the book and climbs the stairs to the top of the building. Stark is in hot pursuit; he catches up to her on the roof, cornering her and claims that the child is there in Bucharest. He then asks her if she wonders why she was chosen and how she's been able to keep the Lexicon from creatures more powerful than her. He states that she is a "nephalim," a half-breed between an angel named "Simon" (a character from [[The Prophecy|the first film]]) and a human, bred specifically to protect the Lexicon; therefore Allison is nothing more than a tool.  Dylan, who is feeling the effects of death more than ever, staggers to the roof; he is caught between them. Allison tells him to accept God's will on faith, but Stark is telling him to complete his task so he can be done with this miserable existence. Dylan is torn; he goes back and forth between them before shooting Allison repeatedly in the chest. Nevertheless, there was method in his madness; as Allison falls over the precipice, the pages of the Lexicon scatter everywhere. The winds carry them throughout the streets of Bucharest, and Allison survives due to her "nephalim" healing powers. Now, Stark has no way of tracking them all down. The final page, the one Stark was looking for, falls at the feet of a young boyâa young boy named Mykael Paun.  
The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio
 ''The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio'' is based on the true story of housewife Evelyn Ryan, who helped support her husband, Kelly,  and their 10 children by winning jingle-writing contests. Kelly failed to support his family in part due to apparent [[alcoholism]]. He dreamed of being a singer but lost his singing voice in a car accident, and was often cruel and abusive.    Evelyn wins a large freezer, ice buckets, a washer and dryer set, a trip to [[New York City]], sleds, boots, a pony, a palm tree, a window, a sports car, a shopping spree in her local grocery store, ice crushers, a camera, dance shoes, a boat motor, pogo sticks, a case of dog food, and a lifetime supply of bird seed. Kelly, who feels like his role as provider for the family is being threatened, criticizes Evelyn, and damages the prizes she wins.  Their children side with her. Kelly gets angry at Evelyn and knocks her over while she is carrying 12 full glass bottles of milk, causing her to nearly sever a ligament. Evelyn is able to talk him down after each incident and, temporarily at least, he treats her better.  Evelyn is largely isolated because of the hours she has to spend caring for the children, and the lack of local intellectual equals. However, she is contacted by a group of other contest-entering mid-western housewives and befriends them. Ultimately, Evelyn discovers that Kelly had secretly taken out a second mortgage on their house and never made payments on it, leaving the family subject to an almost-certain [[foreclosure]]. The children pray for their mother's miraculous victory in a contest sponsored by [[Dr Pepper]]. She wins and pays the mortgage on the house.  Years later, it is revealed that after Kelly died, Evelyn finds out that he has placed his pension checks in a bank account especially for her. The actual Ryan children are then shown as adults.  
The Proposition (2005 film)
 Set in the Australian [[outback]] in the 1880s, the movie follows a series of events following the horrific rape and murder of the Hopkins family, likely committed by the infamous Burns brothers gang.  The film opens in a remote building with a violent gunfight between the police and Charlie Burns' ([[Guy Pearce]]) gang, which ends with the deaths of all of the gang members except for Charlie and his younger brother Mikey. Captain Stanley ([[Ray Winstone]]) makes a proposition to Charlie: he and the feeble-minded Mikey can go free of the crimes they have committed if Charlie kills his older brother, Arthur ([[Danny Huston]]). Arthur is a mercurial psychopath who is so vicious the Aboriginal tribes refer to him as "The Dog Man" and both the police and the Aborigines refuse to go near his camp. Captain Stanley states his intention to civilize the harsh Australian wilderness by bringing Arthur to justice and using Mikey as leverage. Charlie has nine days to find and kill Arthur, or else Mikey will be [[hanged]] from the gallows on Christmas Day.  Captain Stanley's motivations for taming Australia are revealed: he has been forced to move there with his delicate wife, Martha Stanley ([[Emily Watson]]), and apparently wants to make it a safer place for them to live. The Stanleys were friends of the Hopkins family, leading Martha to have nightmares about her dead friends. Word spreads of Stanley's deal with Charlie, primarily from Stanley's corrupt subordinate, Sergeant Lawrence ([[Robert Morgan (Australian actor)|Robert Morgan]]), causing disgust among the townspeople.  Shortly thereafter, Eden Fletcher ([[David Wenham]]), for whom Captain Stanley works, orders that Mikey be given one hundred [[Flagellation|lashes]] as punishment for the rape and murder of the Hopkins family. Stanley is aghast at this, not only because he believes Mikey is likely innocent and the flogging may kill him or harm him irreparably, but also because it will break his deal with Charlie and bring the Burns gang's revenge upon him and his wife. Stanley sends Sergeant Lawrence away with tracker Jacko ([[David Gulpillil]]) and other men to "investigate" the reported slaying of Dan O'Riley by a group of Aborigines.  Meanwhile, Charlie rides in search of Arthur, drinking and apparently reflecting. Along the way, he encounters an inebriated old man named Jellon Lamb ([[John Hurt]]). In the course of conversation, Charlie realizes that Lamb is a [[bounty hunter]] in pursuit of the Burns brothers and knocks him out. Later on, after sleeping on a rock bed, Charlie awakes and is speared in the chest by a group of Aboriginal men standing over him. Seconds later a gunshot is heard and the head of the man who threw the spear explodes. Charlie then passes out.  Charlie wakes up in the camp of his brother Arthur, located in caves among desolate mountains. Arthur's gang consists of Samuel Stoat ([[Tom Budge]]), who shot the Aboriginal man who had speared Charlie; a woman named Queenie ([[Leah Purcell]]) who tends to Charlie's wound; and a muscular Aboriginal man called Two-Bob ([[Tom E. Lewis]]). As he recovers from his wounds, Charlie has several opportunities to kill his brother, but does not.  Captain Stanley attempts to defend Mikey by gunpoint from the bloodthirsty townspeople, but is overruled once Martha arrives, insisting on revenge for her dead friends. Mikey is brutally flogged and horrifically wounded. The formerly excited townspeople slowly become disgusted and Martha faints at the ghastly display. Captain Stanley grabs the whip and throws it at Fletcher, staining him with blood. Fletcher fires Stanley.  Near Arthur's camp, Sergeant Lawrence and his men have found and butchered a group of Aborigines. Arthur and Two-Bob find Lawrence's group while they sleep and kill Jacko and Sergeant Lawrence. Before Arthur [[Stomp (strike)|stomps]] Lawrence to death, Lawrence tells Arthur that Charlie has been sent to kill him. Jellon Lamb enters Arthur's camp and ties up Samuel and Charlie, both of whom are sleeping. Lamb is shot from behind by the returning Two-Bob. Arthur then begins torturing the still-living Lamb with a knife to the heart. Charlie points his revolver at Arthur, but instead shoots Jellon in the head, putting him out of his misery.  Charlie decides he wants to break out Mikey and informs Arthur. Arthur, Samuel and Charlie ride into town dressed in the clothes taken from the officers Arthur and Two-Bob had killed, while Two-Bob poses as an Aborigine they have captured. Once at the jail, the men free Mikey, and Charlie and Two-Bob ride off with him. Arthur and Samuel remain to torture and slaughter the two officers inside the jail. The badly injured Mikey, who has never recovered from the flogging, dies in Charlie's arms. As they bury Mikey, Two-Bob tells Charlie that all of this is Charlie's fault: "You should never have left us."  Captain Stanley and Martha let their guard down to have a peaceful Christmas dinner. Immediately following their conclusion of grace, Arthur and Samuel shoot open the door and invade their home. Arthur pulls Captain Stanley into the other room and brutally beats him, while Samuel taunts his wife. Samuel drags Martha inside, and Arthur shoots Captain Stanley through the shoulder. As Samuel assaults Martha, Charlie walks in and informs Arthur of Mikey's death; Arthur ignores the news and encourages Charlie to listen to Samuel's beautiful singing. Charlie walks up to Samuel and shoots him [[point blank]] in the head, then shoots Arthur twice, saying afterward, "No more." Arthur staggers out of the house. Charlie tells Captain Stanley "I'm going to be with my brother." He leaves the house and follows a trail of blood to find Arthur seated on the ground nearby and sits down next to him. Arthur states that Charlie has finally stopped him and asks what he will do now, to no answer, and dies as his brother watches the blood red sunset of the outback.  
The Promise (2005 film)
 Qingcheng, a starving girl, wanders around the land in search of food. She chances upon a boy, tricks him, steals a [[mantou]] from him, and runs away. She encounters the goddess Manshen and accepts an offer to enjoy a wealthy and luxurious life and become the most beautiful woman in the land. However, she has a price to pay: She will never find everlasting and true love. She becomes the King's concubine when she grows up.  General Guangming defeats a large army of barbarians with only 1,000 soldiers and rushes back to save the King, who is besieged in the palace by the traitorous Duke Wuhuan. He meets Manshen, who tells him someone wearing his Crimson Armour will commit [[regicide]] and tarnish his reputation. A while later, Guangming is caught off guard and injured by Snow Wolf, Wuhuan's henchman, but is saved by his slave, Kunlun. He orders Kunlun to wear his crimson armour and save the King. When Kunlun asks his master how he can identify the King, Guangming tells him the King is the one without a weapon. Kunlun arrives at the palace and mistakes Qingcheng for the King because she is unarmed, and instead kills the King, who has just drawn his sword. He flees with Qingcheng, but they end up being cornered at a cliff by Wuhuan and his men. Wuhuan promises to not harm Qingcheng if Kunlun jumps off the cliff.  Kunlun jumps off the cliff but survives the fall. In the meantime, Guangming's subordinates accuse their General of killing the King and turn against him. Kunlun returns, saves his master and gives him back his Crimson Armour. They go to rescue Qingcheng from Wuhuan later. Qingcheng falls in love with Guangming after mistaking him for the person who jumped off the cliff.

Snow Wolf is actually from the same land as Kunlun and was forced to become Wuhuan's servant. Snow Wolf also tells Kunlun that no one is capable of crossing over to the other side of the Veil of Time.  Wuhuan lures Guangming back to the palace and captures him. He then places Guangming, Kunlun, and Qingcheng on a [[show trial]] for regicide. During the trial, Kunlun confesses that he killed the King, and Qingcheng realises he is actually the one who saved her earlier. Guangming, Kunlun, and Qingcheng are sentenced to death but they break free and fight Wuhuan, who tells Qingcheng he is the boy she stole a mantou from. Both Wuhuan and Guangming die in the fight while Kunlun is fatally wounded. Kunlun survives after wearing Snow Wolf's immortality robe. Manshen appears when Kunlun and Qingcheng are attempting to pass through the Veil of Time, and tells Qingcheng that the promises made between deities and humans are as fragile as ordinary promises. Qingcheng has finally found her true love and thus given herself an opportunity to choose again. Manshen advises her to choose wisely. The film ends with the opening scene showing Qingcheng, as a little girl, wandering around.  
Priyasakhi
 Sandhana Krishnan (Madhavan), also known as Sakhi, is an automobile company employee who lives in a joint family. He comes across a model named Priya (Sadha) and becomes attracted to her. Sakhi uses Priya's friend to gain her attention. He later comes across her diary and uses it to make Priya fall for him by posing as her ideal guy. Sakhi tricks priya and his family (tells them lies about how Priya is the ideal bride and fits well into their family and they get married. Unlike Sakhi's conservative family, Priya's wealthy family is 'cosmopolitan' and outgoing. Her mother (Aishwarya) is a party going socialite, while her father (Pratap K. Pothen) restricts himself to his house and is generally ignored by his wife. Priya is accustomed to being independent as she had a career, (which she had to  give up after marriage) and a supportive, open minded mother. Brought up with modern values, Priya finds it hard to adjust with the family of Sakhi, since they believe in different values and are quite honestly stuck in the previous era where women are meant only for kitchen. Sakhi, tactless and naive goes about life as usual, as in before he got married. He doesn't think about Priya, but puts his family first. one example, He tells Priya that they will be going to the movies but Priya comes to know too late that the 'date' includes his entire family. When Priya points out that as newly weds, any wife would want/expect their first outgoing would be just them not a battalion, Sakhi gets pissed off but gives lame excuse as how he's possessive and would like to have his family with him BS. Another time, Sakhi insensitively hands out the necklace Priya purchases for herself to his sister before his entire family because she admired it, without asking Priya first. Priya understandably is upset, but refrains from making a scene, instead choosing to berate Sakhi in private. Sakhi acts like a jackass, saying if Priya likes that necklace she could use it whenever she wants as it stays in the family anyhow. Priya mentions that Sakhi had no right to offer her stuff to someone else and she's only mentioning that he has a bad attitude so he will correct it. They frequently fight, mostly because Sakhi's lies didn't prepare him for the reality where he and Priya are from two different worlds. Eventually, Priya becomes pregnant. Sakhi is overjoyed but Priya has doubts, as she isn't mentally prepared and also because she thinks, their constant fights will have a negative influence on the child. Priya also argues that it has only been 4 months into their marriage and she's still too young, but they can have kids later. Sakhi stubbornly states, he wants the kid, to hell with what you - the person who actually has to carry the baby wants is heavily implied.  Priya is miserable but still decides to carry out the term for sakhi and mentions to her mother about her situation. Priya's mother makes an appointment for her to have an abortion. Sakhi finds out in time and rushes to the hospital where a reluctant Priya is being pulled towards the operation theatre by her mother. Priya is injured at the hospital in an accident and Sakhi takes her back to his home to recover. How she doesn't lose the baby is a mystery no one knows the answer to. This question plagues us till the end of the movie. They fight again, followed by another fight and Sakhi forgetting Priya's birthday and later wishing her. on her birthday before the party, Priya finds her old diary in Sakhi's suitcase, and the two have an epic argument in which she accuses him of tricking her into loving and marrying him. Sakhi hits her in front of guests and she leaves to go to her parents' house and expresses her desire to get divorced, and also to abort the child. Sakhi challenges her decision and takes her to court. The judge rules that Priya will have to have the baby after which, custody goes to Sakhi. Because Indian judiciary system strongly believes a women is owned either by her husband or father and has no right over her own body, let alone life. Sakhi moves into Priya's parents' house with her in order to take care of his unborn child, claiming he doesn't trust them, as they might try to abort his baby. After delivery, Priya moves back in with Sakhi's family for a period of two months, to feed and care for the child. As time passes, Priya becomes extremely attached to the child and is unwilling to leave. She eventually agrees to give full custody to Sakhi since she sees how much he loves the baby.  Heartbroken supposedly, Priya leaves with her parents. In the car, her mother happily speaks of another possible husband for Priya. She is devastated since she is manipulated into thinking she loves Sakhi and that no woman truly wants a divorce, that only motherhood and having a husband fulfills her life. I'm also not ruling out Stockholm syndrome at this point. Finally, Priya's father stands up to his wife and encourages Priya to reconcile with her husband. Priya jumps out of the car and stands on the road, unsure of what to do and where to go. Sakhi, who has been following them (creepy stalker alert), meets her in the street. The two ask each other for forgiveness and reconcile. Although why Priya apologies and seeks forgiveness when Sakhi is the one at fault here, beats me.  In the end, this movie is a patriarchal and male chauvinistic show all the way. If you're a feminist or simply a person who believes in everyone having a right to their own body, this movie will have you seething at the everyday unfairness and injustice of the social system.  
The Prophecy: Uprising
 In [[Romania]], theology student Allison has come into possession of The Lexicon, a mysterious book of prophecies that writes itself. This book contains a 23rd chapter of the [[Book of Revelation]], which is still not complete. The last chapter depicts the end of the war of angels and the name of the [[Antichrist]]. One of the angels who fell with [[Satan]], [[Belial]] (now a [[demon]]), wants this book.  Simon, a good angel, opposes him and guides Allison by taking advantage of her mental illness to speak directly to her. While searching for Allison and the book, and to avoid detection, Belial murders people and takes their form.

After revealing himself, Satan brings Dani to the house that was the site of the inhumane tortures. Allison, with guidance of the voices in her head, reaches the same place, followed by Belial, as Laurel. It is the only place where Belial cannot hurt Allison. It is a place of evil, which makes it Satan's domain, and he offers Allison his protection.  Satan explains that, for his own motives, he is willing to assist humanity, as he does not wish Belial to succeed, though he is unable or unwilling to take direct action.  Dani confesses  his sins and seeks forgiveness but is rebuked by his sister. It is here that real motives are revealed. Belial, who was once loyal to Satan, has grown tired of the war between angels and its blurring of morality. Even Satan has taken more of shade of gray, and Belial wants to return to the black and white morality of earlier times. Satan opposes him because he wants to prolong the fighting and prevent a new Hell from emerging. Dani, realizing that Belial needs a host, shoots Laurel, but, before he can kill himself, he is possessed.  Allison kills her brother, and Satan absorbs Belial's soul. After Allison forgives her brother, she leaves the house.  At dawn, Satan tells Allison that, for the present, the war of angels is over, but it will not be for long.

Pusher 3
 , an aging Serbian drug lord, attends a meeting of [[Narcotics Anonymous]]. The five-days-sober Milo admits that he is worried that the stress of cooking for his daughter's 25th birthday celebration will cause him to [[relapse]] into using. Milo departs the meeting to pick up a drug shipment with his henchman Branko. Though he requested [[heroin]], the shipment turns out to be 10,000 [[MDMA|ecstasy]] pills. Seeking an explanation, Milo meets with his [[Albanians|Albanian]] supplier Luan. The Albanians agree to send a new shipment of heroin and allow Milo to try to sell the ecstasy as well.   After a quick talk with his demanding and spoiled daughter, Milena, Milo goes back to the kitchen at his club to cook for the party. After Milo forces his henchman to try his cooking, he meets his associate Little Muhammed, who has come to drop off his daily haul. The pugnacious Muhammed warns Milo to respect younger hoods like himself, calling himself "King of Copenhagen", but Milo mockingly calls him the "[[King Kong]] of Copenhagen." However, as Milo knows nothing about ecstasy, he needs Muhammed to set up a buyer for the pills. When all of Milo's henchmen get [[food poisoning]] from his cooking, Milo has no choice but to trust Muhammed to make the sale alone and return within an hour.  The birthday celebration begins and Milo splits his time between mingling with guests, cooking, and trying to contact the tardy Muhammed. While buying wine at an underground store, Milo learns that Milena's boyfriend, Mike, is in fact a [[drug dealer]]. He forces Mike to accept him as his sole supplier, and then haggles with his daughter over the price. While waiting in a restaurant for an emergency supply of fish, Milo bumps into Kurt the Cunt, a low-level drug dealer who gives him some heroin. The over-stressed Milo breaks down and smokes some of it. Having not heard from Muhammed in four hours, Milo contacts a [[police corruption|corrupt cop]] who promises to find him.  When Milo meets with Luan to admit that he lost the ecstasy and needs more time to pay for them, the Albanians force Milo into a partnership to settle the issue. Using his kitchen as a meeting place, Rexho, an Albanian crook, and a [[Poles|Polish]] [[pimp]] arrive to sell a young girl into [[prostitution]]. Milo tries to distance himself from the transaction in disgust, but Rexho treats him as a subordinate, demanding food and drink and that he serve them. Rexho and the pimp attempt to sell the girl to Jeanette, a local brothel operator, but she refuses to take her, sensing she is likely under the age of 18. Milo gives the girl a piece of his daughter's birthday cake after she reveals that it is her birthday as well. After Rexho leaves, the girl attempts to flee, but Milo helps run her down. The furious pimp begins savagely beating the girl, which ultimately sends Milo over the edge. In a rage he beats the pimp to death with a hammer, then waits for Rexho to return and kills him as well.  The corrupt cop then delivers Muhammed to Milo in the trunk of his car, warning him not to hurt him.   Out of options Milo seeks help from his old friend and ex-henchman Radovan, who left the underworld to start a successful pizza restaurant. Radovan agrees to help Milo one last time. Radovan helps Milo torture Muhammed, who reveals that the ecstasy pills Milo had received were fake. Milo and Radovan stash Muhammed in a freezer after he threatens Milo, and then begin butchering the two [[corpse]]s for disposal. At dawn, Milo returns to his tranquil home and talks with Milena. She wonders why he disappeared during the party, then goes to bed. Milo walks into the backyard and silently smokes a cigarette while looking into his empty [[swimming pool]].

After the death of her father, who had also been deaf, she is sent to live with her godparents, Paul and Olivia Deer, and their daughter, Nina, with whom she used to be close friends. However, she soon learns the secrets her new family withhold from the rest of the world as well as from one another.  Nina constantly insults Dot every chance she gets, unhinged by her arrival.  Dot blames herself for her father's death in a car accident, believing that if she had been with him, she could have warned him of the oncoming danger.  Soon after arriving, Dot discovers an [[incestuous]] relationship between Nina and Paul.  Paul invited Dot to stay in an attempt to control himself, wishing he could end his sexual relationship with Nina.  He tries to tell Olivia about his relationship with Nina, but is unable to bring himself to say it.  Nina resents Dot's presence, saying, "Life sucks, Dot. I feel like I can tell you this. I feel like I can be honest because you can't hear.  Or can you? Look at you, eating your sandwich like a piglet while I talk.  Strangely comforting...When I first met you, I mean when you first moved in, I hated you.  I hated your face, your dumb blank stare.  But now that I feel like I know you again that's all changed.  It's so nice to know there's someone whose life sucks more than mine."  One Day, Nina overhears Dot swear loudly when one of the piano wires breaks while she is playing the piano.  Nina learns that Dot is neither deaf nor mute but, Nina pretends that she doesn't know the truth. For reasons of her own, Nina still pretends that Dot cannot tell anyone and confides in Dot about her plan to murder her father.  Dot becomes aware of everything Nina and Paul do behind closed doors and even tries to help Nina avoid Paul's advances.  Dot is assigned to be lab partners with Connor, a star basketball player. Their partnership arouses jealousy in Michelle Fell, Nina's loud-mouthed best friend, who likes Connor.  Connor is able to communicate well with Dot by [[lip-reading]] in order to work on their report, knowing that with a disability of his own ([[Attention Deficit Disorder]]) he needs to improve his grades to receive a basketball scholarship.  He also becomes very attracted to Dot and confides to her about personal things in his life, believing she is unable to hear him.  After confiding that he is a virgin, Dot undresses for him and he has sex with her.  Meanwhile, Nina confides in Dot that she is planning to kill her father and then running away and becoming a [[stripper]], believing she can become famous "like [[Courtney Love]]."  Before the "Spring Fling" dance, Nina tells Paul that she is pregnant and needs $1,000 for an abortion.  However, once he discovers [[tampons]] in her purse, he realizes that she is lying and is only attempting to obtain the money to get away from home.  As Dot begins to play "[[Moonlight Sonata]]" downstairs, Paul confronts Nina about her lie.  Nina tries to explain, but Paul, distressed that his daughter wants to leave him, begins to physically abuse her.  The abuse turns into a rape attempt.  Dot recognizes what is going on upstairs, stops playing piano and heads upstairs. The music finally stops when Dot uses a piano wire to strangle Paul to death, screaming at him to leave Nina alone.  All the while, Olivia remains downstairs, staring at the news in a pill-induced stupor.  When Paul's body hits the ground, Nina starts screaming and cursing at Dot.  Olivia comes upstairs and her only comment on being faced with Paul's body is to tell Dot that it's a miracle that she can hear.  The two girls go to the dance club where Dot dances with Connor, then she reveals to him that she is able to hear and talk.  Connor calls her a psycho and storms away in anger.  Both girls bury Nina's dress, which has her father's blood on it.  At this point, Nina questions Dot about pretending to be deaf and mute.  Dot reveals that she wanted to be closer to her father so that she wouldn't be alone after her mother's death.  When the girls return home, Olivia has turned herself into the police and claims that she, not Dot, had killed Paul in order to protect her daughter Nina and atone for allowing the abuse.  The film ends on a philosophical note as the two girls play piano together, freed from their respective fathers.

Racing Stripes
 During a thunderstorm, a [[traveling circus]], Circus Sarano, accidentally leaves behind a baby zebra ([[Jansen Panettiere]]) after replacing a flat tire. The foal is rescued by widower and former racehorse trainer Nolan Walsh ([[Bruce Greenwood]]), and is taken to his farm where his 13 year old daughter, Channing ([[Hayden Panettiere]]) names him Stripes. He meets a [[Shetland pony]] named Tucker ([[Dustin Hoffman]]); a goat named Franny ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]); and a rooster named Reggie ([[Jeff Foxworthy]]). The next day, Stripes soon becomes convinced that he is destined for the nearby racetrack, the Kentucky Open, not realizing that he is a zebra and is not qualified to race. Two foals named Trenton's Pride (Kyle Alcazar) and Ruffshodd (Frankie Ryan Manriquez) decide to race Stripes until they are stopped by Pride's father, Kentucky Open champion, Sir Trenton ([[Fred Dalton Thompson]]).  Three years later, after racing the mailman again, an adult Stripes ([[Frankie Muniz]]) meets an [[Arabian Horse|Arabian filly]] named Sandy ([[Mandy Moore]]) and develops a crush on her after losing to the mailman in their usual race. While talking to Sandy, he is approached by Pride ([[Joshua Jackson]]) and Ruffshodd ([[Michael Rosenbaum]]), Stripes' tormentors since childhood. Pride challenges Stripes to a racing match on a Blue Moon night; he accepts, but loses the race. The following day, Tucker, having secretly watched Stripes, approaches him and suggests that he gets proper training first. Stripes, in need of a rider, chooses 16 year old Chan and convinces a new farm animal, a pelican named Goose ([[Joe Pantoliano]]), to sabotage Chan's motorcycle and Old Blue, Nolan's old pickup truck, so that Chan can ride him to her workplace at the Kentucky Open. The plan works, and Chan, with Nolan's reluctant approval, rides Stripes to the Kentucky Open. There, Chan is antagonized by her boss, Clara Dalrymple ([[Wendie Malick]]), for bringing Stripes to the racetrack, while Stripes meets a pair of [[horsefly]] brothers, Buzz and Scuzz ([[Steve Harvey]] and [[David Spade]]).  As night approaches, Chan, remembering her first ride on horseback with her mother, Carolyn, completes a lap around the track with Stripes. They are approached by Woodzie ([[M. Emmet Walsh]]), a racetrack gambler and old friend of the family, who encourages Chan to sign her and Stripes up for a tryout race tomorrow. She does, despite Nolan's disapproval stemming from his wife, Carolyn's death in a racing accident six years ago, which discouraged him to continue training horses after that, but Stripes has a major meltdown after being easily scared by the horse-gate like all the other horses the next morning at the tryouts. Once he calms down, he begins running, but then gets hit in the face by flying dirt while racing, causing Chan to fall off. Though she is uninjured, Nolan chastises her. Then, Dalrymple sarcastically signs Stripes up to compete in the Kentucky Open competition. Meanwhile, Stripes realizes he is a zebra after being told off by Sir Trenton, which severely discourages him. Despite Chan's pleas and Woodzie's encouragement, Nolan refuses to let her race Stripes. Realizing this, the farm animals lure Nolan into the farm to show him a table holding his past accomplishments and he changes his mind. Meanwhile, due to Stripes' misbehavior during training, Franny reveals to Stripes that Tucker helped Nolan train the racehorse champions including Sir Trenton without getting any thanks, which encourages him to begin training.  Refusing to allow Stripes to race, Sir Trenton and several thoroughbreds ambush Stripes and Sandy at a creek as they are talking and making up for their previous argument one night, kidnapping Sandy and threatening to hurt her if he races. The next day, after rescuing Stripes, Tucker, Franny, and Goose agree to rescue Sandy. They do it (with a little help from Buzz and Scuzz) and get back in time for Stripes to go to the race. Before the race, Nolan bets Dalrymple that if he wins then he gets Sandy, and if he loses then he will come back to work for her. During the race, Ruffshodd tries to stop Stripes from winning until Scuzz deliberately gets him disqualified. Later, Stripes begins to wear out until he finally remembers something Tucker taught him, which boosts up his confidence, and he wins the race and finally earns respect from the other racehorses, including Pride. In the end, they all pose together in a group photo, which is later shown with the other previous Walsh wins.

When boarding, Lisa discovers to her surprise that Jackson is seated beside her.  Soon after take off, Lisa learns from Jackson that he is working for a [[domestic terrorist]] organization planning to assassinate Charles Keefe ([[Jack Scalia]]), the current [[United States Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security]]. Lisa is instrumental in their plans because of her job at the Keefes' hotel, The Lux Atlantic Hotel, as Acting Manager. Lisa must make a call from the [[in-flight phone]] to arrange for Keefe to be moved to the targeted room where a missile will be fired from an adjacent boat in a harbor, killing Keefe and his family. Jackson threatens to kill her father, Joe ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]), with a [[hitman]] should she refuse to cooperate.  Lisa attempts to find a way to keep both her father and Keefe safe. When she first places a call to the hotel, answered by her co-worker, Cynthia ([[Jayma Mays]]), the line goes dead midway through the conversation, and Lisa tries (unsuccessfully) to fool Jackson into thinking she is still ordering the room change, but Jackson catches on. She then makes two unsuccessful tries to alert the other passengers to the danger. She first attempts to write a warning in a book, when a friendly woman ([[Angela Paton]]) from the check-in line she met and gave the book to comes to talk to her about it, but Jackson knocks her unconscious and manages to get the book back before the woman sees the message. She tries again when the airphones go out due to the storms. Lisa goes to the restroom, and writes a warning in soap on the mirror, but Jackson confronts her and sees the writing on the mirror, and forces Lisa back inside, locking the door. A little girl witnesses Jackson enter the bathroom with Lisa still inside and notifies an attendant, but she dismisses it as Jackson and Lisa having sex. When Lisa begs him not to kill her father, Jackson simply responds by telling her she should stop gambling with his life. He then notices a scar above Lisa's breast, and asks her if someone did that to her. When she tells him no, he believes that she is lying and briefly chokes her before wiping away the message.  When Lisa and Jackson return to their seats, Lisa makes the phone call, and the hotel staff move the politician to the targeted suite. After the call, she asks Jackson to call off the man outside her father's house, but he refuses until he has confirmation of the assassination.  As the plane lands at [[Miami International Airport]], Lisa confesses that the knife scar was from a violent rape she suffered two years ago, which she swore she would never let it happen again. She then stabs Jackson in the throat with a pen that she stole from another passenger, then takes his phone and flees the plane and terminal, narrowly escaping both Jackson and airport security. The little girl from before witnesses the stabbing and helps Lisa escape by pushing a suitcase into Jackson's way, causing him to fall. Once outside, Lisa steals a nearby SUV. Noticing that the phone has a low-battery warning and could die at any time, she once again calls the hotel, alerting Cynthia to the danger. Cynthia pulls the fire alarm to evacuate the building and rushes to warn Keefe and his family, who are in the targeted suite. Cynthia, the Keefes, and [[U.S. Secret Service]] agents manage to escape from the room seconds before a [[FGM-148 Javelin|Javelin missile]] hits.  Lisa, still driving, tries to call her father, but the cell phone's battery dies. She rushes to her father's house, arriving to find the hitman outside his door. He pulls out a gun and shoots through the windshield numerous times, attempting to kill her, but fails when she hits him with the car and sends him flying into the house's front door, killing him. Lisa finds her father inside, and he tells her that he has called the police because of the car crash. While Lisa phones the hotel to check that everyone is all right, Jackson arrives and knocks her father unconscious. He chases her through the house with a knife and they fight until Jackson manages to throw Lisa down a flight of stairs. Lisa retrieves the dead hitman's gun from the floor and threatens Jackson with it. He attempts to escape, but Lisa shoots him before he can. He disarms and attacks her and is about to kill her when Lisa's father takes a gun and shoots Jackson in the chest.   Later at the hotel, Keefe and the Secret Service thank Lisa and Cynthia for saving him and his family from the assassination. Bob and Marianne Taylor, two of the visitors at the hotel, confront Lisa and Cynthia and angrily complain about their stay. Lisa tells them to fill out a comment card at the front desk, and then tells them to "shove it up their ass".

The Red Shoes (2005 film)
 Sun-jae ([[Kim Hye-soo]]) leaves her unfaithful husband, Sung-joon (Lee Eol), and moves into an old apartment with her daughter, Tae-su (Park Yeon-ah). During Sun-jae's return home, she takes a pair of hot pink high heels she found in a subway car, only to discover that they are cursed. Her obsession grows, arousing envy and greed with mysterious, nightmarish visions. Even Tae-su and one of Sun-jae's friends, Kim Mi-hee ([[Go Soo-hee]]), fall victim to the power of the shoes, resulting in hysteria and theft. Mi-hee dies soon after she takes the shoes, and the shoes return to Tae-su(possibly inferring that she could be the reincarnation of Keiko). Sun-jae is horrified by this and tries to get rid of the shoes.  With the help of her new boyfriend, In-cheol ([[Kim Sung-soo (actor)|Kim Sung-soo]]), Sun-jae tries to uncover the mystery behind the pink shoes before it kills her and Tae-su. She discovers that although the original owner of the shoes escape harm, the person who takes them will die with their feet chopped off. The mystery leads to an old woman who lives in a basement below Sun-jae. The old woman refuses to disclose any information, and they chase after her in the parking lot. She identifies Sun-jae as Oki, which confuses Sun-jae. It is revealed that in her youth during the last years of the Japanese occupation of Korea, the old woman was a servant for a vain and sadistic dancer named, Oki. The old woman was often abused by her, which lead her hunchback and being fearful of her. Oki was jealous of a young, prominent dancer named Keiko, who was the daughter of a high-ranking officer, and was very talented. This is made worse when she blessed with pink shoes from a male dancer who had been her lover. Oki wanted the shoes for herself and paid the old woman with a scarf to steal them from Keiko. Though she succeeded in stealing the shoes for Oki, the old woman watched her and Keiko fight over them at the photo shoot for a ballet advertisement. Then one night, a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] Keiko witnessed her lover and Oki having sex. When she ran off out of betrayal and grief, the man tried to stop Keiko. Fed up with being second and realizing the man loves Keiko, Oki grabbed a sharp weapon and viciously attacked her. Taking her and the male dancer outside in a raining forest, Oki continued her attack until Keiko is dead. Oki then dumps her body in an unmarked grave. She wasn't aware that the old woman had watched Keiko's murder unfold and laughed as she took the shoes for herself. Feeling guilt and grief for cheating on Keiko, the man refuses to dance with Oki during the performance, but had to. Keiko's ghost then got her revenge on both the man and Oki, leading to their deaths. The old woman warns Sun-jae the same fate that will befall her if she doesn't return the pink shoes to Keiko at once.  At Keiko's gravesite, Sun-jae returns the pink shoes to her, hoping this will end the haunting she has been tormented with. Later on, she visits In-cheol only to discover he has found out that she killed her husband. She tries to deny it, but when she learns that Tae-su told him the truth, she hurries home to try to kill her. Sun-jae chases Tae-su to the subway station tracks in an attempt to kill her, but at the last second, she moves her daughter away from the train. Tae-su seemingly disappears from her. While attempting to find her, Sun-jae is then confronted by the ghost of Keiko, who tells her the haunting truth. It is revealed that Sun-jae is the reincarnation of Oki, revealing why the old woman feared her the most upon their first meeting in the elevator. Sun-jae denies it claiming she has the wrong woman. However, Keiko reveals she's known the truth and taunts her by laughing continuously. She shows how Sun-jae murdered her husband, her best friend, Mi-hee, her boyfriend In-cheol, and attempted to kill her own daughter, Tae-su. As Sun-jae tries to escape, she is then face to face with a deformed Keiko who finally claims her.  The scene transitions to 1944 when Keiko is dancing proudly in her pink shoes during rehearsals. The last scene reveals Tae-su practicing her ballet skills in her mother's bedroom. In a post credit scene in the future, a grown up Tae-su picks up the pink shoes in the park(suggesting that Keiko meant for Tae-su to inherit the shoes).  
Reefer Madness (2005 film)
 In a small middle-America town in 1936, a group of parents have been gathered by a mysterious Lecturer for an assembly. The ominous Lecturer informs the parents that he has come to warn them about the evils of [[marijuana]] on their youth ''("Reefer Madness")'' through the tragic tale of one boy's struggles with the demon weed in a film titled [[Reefer Madness|''"Tell Your Children"'']]. Throughout the film, the Lecturer stops to detail a political point or to condescend any audience member questioning his credibility.  Jimmy Harper and Mary Lane, a joyful teen couple, blissfully enjoy each other's company ''("Romeo & Juliet")'', unaware of the seedy goings-on in The Reefer Den across town. This is the residence of Mae, who is abused by her boyfriend, Jack, a street tough who supplies her and others with dope ''("The Stuff")''. Mary, Jimmy and their school friends head to Miss Poppy's [[Five and Dime]], ''("Down at the Ol' Five and Dime").'' Jack appears at the hangout, offering Jimmy swing lessons to impress Mary.  Jimmy is taken to the Reefer Den, where Jack, Mae, college dropout Ralph and neighborhood slut Sally pressure him into smoking his first joint, leading him to a hallucination of an insidious bacchanal. ''("Jimmy Takes a Hit/ The Orgy")''. Jimmy turns into a crazed addict and neglects Mary, leading her to pray for him ''("Lonely Pew").'' While breaking into a church to steal collection money, Jimmy has a vision of [[Jesus Christ]] in a Vegas-esque Heaven, telling him to change his ways or be sent to [[damnation|eternal damnation]] ''("Listen to Jesus, Jimmy")''. Jimmy refuses to heed the word of God and continues to spiral into sin.  One night, Jimmy and Sally take a joy ride in Mary's stolen car while buzzed, running over an old man. Jimmy runs to Mary, debating whether to continue being under the influence or repent his ways ''("Mary Jane/ Mary Lane").'' Jimmy returns to Mary romantically, but he realizes that he is putting her in danger and tells her that he must leave town without her. Jack brings him back to the Reefer Den with a [[Cannabis foods|pot-brownie]], putting him in a [[Golden Age of American animation|cartoonized]] trip ''("The Brownie Song").'' Mary follows Jimmy to the Den where Ralph seduces her by convincing her that Jimmy has joined his "[[Phi|frat]][[Beta|ern]][[Cannabis|ity]]". He suggests that they celebrate with a smoke, which turns out to be a toke. This intro to reefer immediately turns Mary into a sadistic [[dominatrix]] who terrorizes Ralph for pleasure ''("Little Mary Sunshine)''. Jimmy enters and a fight ensues. Jack stops the fight, knocks out Jimmy and accidentally shoots Mary. He frames an unconscious Jimmy for the crime. Jimmy gives Mary his class ring, and comforts her as she dies in his arms ''("Mary's Death")''.  Jimmy is taken away by police. Racked with guilt, Ralph has pot-induced hallucinations of Jimmy as a ghost, Mary as Satan's sodomy pal and the children who got hooked on the Reefer Gang's dope as the living dead. Ralph gets an extreme case of the munchies and cannibalizes Sally. Jack shoots Ralph to stop him ''("Murder!")''. Seeing similar visions, Mae realizes the error of her ways and tells Jack to do the same. He rejects her pleas and she bludgeons him to death with a garden hoe, gaining her much-needed empowerment ''("The Stuff (Reprise)").  Mae pleads to the visiting [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President]] about Jimmy's case, earning the boy a presidential [[pardon]]. Jimmy, Mae, the President and Jimmy's fellow prisoners, Ralph, Jack, and Sally (reincarnated as [[Uncle Sam]], [[George Washington]], and [[Statue of Liberty|Lady Liberty]] respectively) raise the American justice system and patriotism ''("Tell 'Em the Truth")''. Jimmy burns down the Reefer Den's weed garden, freeing Mary from both Hell and [[Satan]] before everyone's eyes. The Lecturer's film ends with Mary entering Heaven, greeted by Jesus and other Holy souls.  The entire audience joins the suddenly real film cast to hold a huge anti-reefer [[bonfire|book burning]] pledging to join the fight against marijuana, sex, racial and ethnic minorities and other things harmful to their dear country ''("Finale")''. The Lecturer drives off, pleased that he has succeeded in exploiting everyone's biases.  
Red Eye (2005 South Korean film)
 July 16, 1988 a night train (or "red eye") to Yeosu leaves Seoul station and crashes killing 250 people. Exactly 15 years later to the day, a train is running the same line for the last time. But it has incorporated some of the coaches from the old crashed train.   A stewardess (who manages a drinks and food trolley) named OH Mi-sun ([[Jang Shin-young]]) has just started the job and switched shifts with another woman to take that train. Her father was a guard who died on the crashed train 15 years ago and some blamed him for it. She is the main character in this film and, like another young woman named YOON So-hee ([[Kwak Ji-min]]) (who is with a group of young people), she has psychic powers (which she did not know about) so gets glimpses of "the dead" from the earlier train crash who now ride the train with them.  Unsettling incidents start to occur and two passengers are murdered by supernatural means. With two dead bodies the train is supposed to stop at a station for the police, but it goes through the station because of a crazy young couple who are intent on crashing the train. They were the two tiny children (brother and sister) who were in the first train crash with their parents.  Increasingly strange incidents occur as the lights go out in some carriages and the carriages suddenly look old and in another, lights shatter and glass falls on the passengers. The passengers do not know where to go to escape the coming crash since the back of the train is no longer safe. Mi-Sun tries to stop them from crashing the train.  Mi-sun has gained knowledge from contact with a dead form which rose from a black puddle in one of the carriages and tells them that they are both dead, and that they now inhabit the bodies of other people. Also that their father and his wife planned to kill themselves and the children on that train 15 years ago but the poison he was going to use was ruined by a stewardess JUNG Jin-sook ([[Kim Hyeon-suk]]) when she accidentally kicked the jar it was in, so he got into the driver's cabin and put the train on a collision course with another train, causing the terrible wreck over a decade ago.  In anger the brother smashes Mi-sun's head hard four times against the window causing her to collapse with bleeding to the head but he knows it is true as his sister regresses to a little girl again. Mi-sun's (dead) father comes into the driver's cabin and pilots the train harmlessly through the train that it was on a collision with and the crazy man reverts to a scared child comforting his sister. As the trains, natural and supernatural begin to part, things start getting back to normal on the train with the ghosts disassembling, the old carriages becoming normal again and the human passengers start coming out of hiding.   Mi-sun's father comforts her as she dies from her injuries. The train is finally stopped and it is daylight and the bewildered people get off.  The scene changes to night again and the train for Yeosu arrives in Seoul station for its last run. We see Mi-sun on the platform, and she is again a stewardess on this train on its unnatural journey.  The white end titles are rolled up against a night background that a driver would see from the cabin of the train.

Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis
 Set 10 years after the events of ''[[Return of the Living Dead 3]]'', the film starts out with Charles Garrison (Peter Coyote) traveling to [[Chernobyl]] to collect the last 6 canisters of Trioxin 5. Two Russian sellers take him to an empty power station which contains the Trioxin. One of the Russians get Trioxin on his hands, turning him into a zombie. Upon hearing screams, Garrison runs to see the zombie eating the other Russian partner. Garrison promptly shoots the zombie in the head.  It is then revealed Julian and Jake (also known as Pyro) Garrison, the nephews of Charles, parents were volunteers who died a year earlier at Hybra Tech. Julian leaves the house to go motor biking with his friends. During a stunt, one of Julianâs friends, Zeke falls and gets knocked unconscious. At the hospital, a doctor tells Julian that Zeke had an unexplained reaction to the painkillers and is pronounced dead on arrival.  One of Julianâs friends, Katie, works at Hybra Tech and notices Zeke being brought in. Julian and his friends manage to hack their way into Hybra Tech website and discover Zeke is to be used as a test subject and decide to rescue him.  Meanwhile, Charles is experimenting with the Trioxin. He manages to reanimate an arm and a corpse. However, some of the gas manages to escape through the pipes (unexplainably not affecting Charles) and reanimates a dead rat that two homeless men were eating and it proceeds to attack them.  By using fake IDs, they manage to get into Hybra Tech, with Katie at the security center giving them advice over walkie-talkies. They end up sneaking through the ventilation shaft and find out that Pyro had followed them. They get out of the vent and find themselves in an armory. After some searching they are found by Charles, who shows them where Zeke is.  The group discovers a room full of zombie clones. Uncle Charles explains that they are to be the new test subjects. He also reveals that Julianâs parents are alive before managing to escape. Katie tries to deactivate the alarm but in the process releases all the zombies in the complex. During the chaos, Zeke is bitten on the neck by a zombie, and the group manages to make it to the armory and escape into the vents. Julian, Carlos and Cody separate from the group to find Julianâs parents.  Zeke, Becky and Pyro manage to make it to the parking lot and are able to find keys to a jeep. Unfortunately, Zeke turns into a zombie and tries to eat them, causing them to crash; he retains his mind, but is driven by zombie instincts. Julian meanwhile has found the building where his parents are being held. He finds his zombie parents in a holding tank and sees they have been suited up with circular saws and mini-guns to become "uber-soldiers." They leave the room in disgust and after being chased by zombies run to the roof. A few minutes later Uncle Charles appears in the room with Julianâs parents and releases them from their tanks.  Julian manages to rappel down the building from the roof, where at the bottom, he encounters two zombies. The zombies are killed as Katie appears in a new truck and runs the zombies over. Julian and Cody then get in the truck.  Meanwhile, Pyro and Becky are trying to fend off zombies. Zeke runs towards Becky but she is pushed out of the way by Pyro. Zeke then eats Pyroâs brains. Becky manages to scare Zeke off just before Katie arrives in the truck. They pick up Becky and escape the zombies. As they drive, Julianâs dad appears and shoots the truck with the mini-gun. After he has finished shooting, Becky gets out of the truck and throws a grenade at him, nearly destroying him.  They all get out of the truck and start running, but encounter Zeke and Julianâs mother. Zeke starts a fist fight with Julian, whilst the group attempt to destroy Julianâs mother. They succeed while Julian manages to destroy Zeke.  The [[SWAT]] team arrives and shoots the remaining zombies, including Julianâs dad and mistakenly shoot Katie. The movie ends with the SWAT team disposing of the bodies, and Uncle Charles escaping with the barrels of Trioxin. The closing scene of the movie shows a newscaster reporting about a supposed zombie outbreak which Hybra Tech denies. In the end the newscaster is attacked by a zombie as the screen goes black.  
Reeker
 A family is driving down a desert highway when they hit a deer. The dad gets out and comes back with half his face gone. The family is attacked by something.  In a lavish apartment, Trip meets with a dealer, Radford, who provides him with pills for a [[rave party|rave]] in the desert. Trip steals all of the pills. He meets with his friends Cookie, Nelson, Jack and Gretchen. The group notices an overturned car on the highway, which they dismiss as an abandoned accident.  Gretchen discovers that Trip is carrying drugs and stops the vehicle to kick him out. While parking at the side of the road, the group notices a short, but strong tremor. Gretchen agrees to take Trip back to a diner, which has been abandoned. The car runs out of gas and breaks down, so they decide to stay at the Halfway Motel. Learning from the radio that the highway has been closed, Trip decides to walk down the road for help.Jack and Gretchen pitch camp and sleep outside. After a haunting experience with the drug dealer Radford, Trip escapes and meets a man named Henry driving an RV, who is looking for his missing wife. He goes with Trip to the motel and sets up camp there. Trip doesn't tell his friends about his run-in with Radford, but warns them to be careful.  Looking for signal reception for his mobile phone, Trip releases from a rubbish skip the still-living head, torso and arms of a truck driver who then crawls away. Henry then meets Trip and discovers they both are seeing the dead people. While in his camper, Henry collapses, suffocating as a dark figure moves through the trailer. Still looking for reception, Trip is attacked on the roof by a hooded figure. Cookie is killed while sitting in an [[outhouse]] by being dragged into the hole.  Nelson is almost dragged under his bed, but pulls himself back up and jumps on top of the bed. He takes his sneaker off and drops it on the ground, watching as it is shredded. He then tries to escape by jumping through the window, but fatally cuts his throat on a shard of glass. Gretchen and Jack discover Nelson's and Henry's bodies, prompting Gretchen to look for Trip. Jack encounters the creature but escapes when Trip shoots at the figure with his gun. Trip is overpowered by the creature and loses his arm, then dies.  In reality an RV crashed into Gretchen's car after Trip stepped out to call for a ride, at the moment when they experienced the tremor. None of the group had noticed the RV, whose driver was Henry. His wife, Rose had explained that he was suffering a [[heart attack]] and lost control. The car that the group saw leaving the diner was in fact their own.  Each of the deaths at the hotel were reflected by their own deaths in the car: Cookie died from internal bleeding, Nelson cut his neck when he was thrown through the windshield, Trip's arm was severed gripping the cell phone and he died from blunt force trauma. Gretchen survived the crash because she was wearing her seat belt and Jack, despite receiving a massive head injury, also remained alive in the car. Radford, who had been stalking Trip, witnessed the accident and attempted to assist; hence the visions of him at the motel and highway.  In the final scene, Gretchen and Jack briefly discuss the fact that neither has any recollection of the accident, and no mention is made of the incidents at the motel. Jack comments that, for a moment in the crash, he thought he could see Gretchen, offhandedly mentioning the color of her eyes.

Reincarnation (film)
 A number of people see visions apparently dead people: a businessman finds one behind him in an elevator. A truck driver runs over one on the road only to be shocked when he investigates the body as the opening credits start.  Professor Norihasa Omori (Atsushi Haruta) visits a local hotel and films himself killing eleven of the hotel guests, employees, his own children before committing suicide, all as part of his wish to understand [[reincarnation]]. Since then, the footage of the murders disappears. Thirty-five years later, horror movie director Ikuo Matsumura (Kippei Shiina) decides to make a film about the massacre. As the date of the shoot draws near, Nagisa Sugiura ([[YÅ«ka (actress)|YÅ«ka]]), the actress who is set to star as Omori's daughter Chisato (Mao Sasaki), is haunted by the [[ghost]]s of the victims. She begins hallucinating and is plagued by nightmares of the killings. She discovers an old film camera which will later be revealed to be the same type the professor used.  Yayoi Kinoshita ([[Karina Nose]]) wakes up in the middle of a psychology class, in which the professor publicly opposes the ideas of reincarnation and [[cryptomnesia]]. She decides to write an essay supporting cryptomnesia and meets Yuka Morita ([[Marika Matsumoto]]), an actress who auditioned for Ikuo's movie. Yuka says she remembers things in a "past life" of hers and shows Yayoi a [[birthmark]] that would appear to be evidence of strangulation, which reveals that she has the same vision as Nagisa. Yayoi and Yuka check out the college library, but ghosts of the dead appear to drag Yuka up and away. Yayoi's research takes her to the only survivor of the attack: Ayumi Omori (Miki Sanjo), the professor's wife. She explains that while many thought he had lost his mind, he had become obsessed that the body is only a vessel.  During filming Nagisa begins to believe that she is the reincarnation of Chisato Omori as she seems to slip into another hallucination during filming. The director becomes the slain son of the professor. Meanwhile, Nagisa's agent reviews the film from the camera which consists of the film the professor took as he murdered his children and others at the hotel. As this film is played, Nagisa reenacts the events in her apparent hallucination. She discovers Yayoi in the cubby where the little girl was slain. Realizing that she is not the real reincarnation of Chisato, Nagisa witnesses the actors, including Yayoi and the director, and the two men seen before the opening credits, all transform into the people they portray in the places where they died. Yuka is revealed as a maid who was hung. With all the victims walking towards her, Nagisa escapes the hotel and runs down the road and into the town. Simultaneously, her agent sees the film of this escape from the professor. Ultimately, Nagisa finds herself cornered in a store. She grabs a piece of class to kill herself before the doll can come to her. She looks at her reflection in the glass and sees the face of the professor. At the same time, her agent watches the knife in the hand of the professor in his film reveal Nagisa's reflection before he cuts his own throat. Nagisa starts to reenact the professor's suicide but the doll reaches her and stops her in time to tell her that they will be together forever.   A group of executives watch Nagisa's take. Among them is the professor's wife. Near the end of the take, Nagisa collapses shaking and screaming as crew members come to her aid. Notice by the professor's wife is her two children in the scene some distance away. She smiles with satisfaction. Sometime later, in a mental ward, Nagisa is bound in a full-body wrap and still haunted by the souls of Omori's children. The professor's wife looks at her from the window of her door then passes through the smaller aperture for food her children's favourite toys: a red ball and the doll. Nagisa screams as they are shoved into her solitary confinement cell as the professor's wife smile. Nagisa eventually calms down with a sinister smile on her face as the ghosts of the children close in on her.

Revolver (2005 film)
 Dorothy Macha ([[Ray Liotta]]) is a gang boss involved in illegal gambling all over the city. With the help of three goons, known as "the three Eddies", he controls several games that take place in the underground. On one occasion, just before a big game, Macha loses his card man. With no chances left, Macha asks for help of Jake Green ([[Jason Statham]]), a card man with a good reputation underground. When Jake refuses, they harass Jake's brother, Billy ([[Andrew Howard]]), and Billy's family to convince Jake to play. He succumbs and plays the game, which he ends up winning. The loser, a high roller named George, insults Jake's mother and Jake responds by shooting him in the foot, igniting a gunfight in which the game's money vanishes.  The police investigation is leading nowhere until Jake's name is mentioned and he is brought in for questioning. Taking precautionary measures, Macha sends the three Eddies to Billy's house where they threaten his niece. Billy's wife reacts poorly in the situation and is accidentally shot. Jake does not give Macha's name to the police to protect Billy and his family and ends up sentenced to prison. He is given a choice to either spend 14 years in general prison population or 7 years in solitary confinement. He chooses the latter.  During his seven-year stint imprisoned in solitary confinement Jake learns of a specific strategy (referred to as "The Formula") that is supposed to lead its user to win every game. The Formula itself was discovered by two unnamed men who inhabited adjacent cells on either side of Jake's own. They are referred to as a chess expert and a con man. During the first five years of his seven-year sentence, the three men communicated their thoughts on confidence tricks and chess moves via messages hidden inside library books, such as ''The Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics''.  The chess expert and the con man plan to leave their cells simultaneously, and promise to take Jake with them. But when they disappear from their cells, they leave Jake behind to serve the remaining two years of his sentence. When Jake is released, he finds that all of his possessions and money have been taken by the two men with whom he had shared everything. Still, he has The Formula, and he goes about making a lot of money at various casinos. Two years later, Jake has garnered a reputation that leads many casinos to fear his freakishly good 'luck', and he is [[Black Book (gambling)|blacklisted]] by many casinos in fear that he will earn money in them. The Formula applies to any game, and is often exemplified by Jake's apparent mastery of chess. The story revolves around Jake's epiphanic awakening, as he learns how to apply the Formula to the 'game' of life.  Approximately two years after his prison release, Jake, Billy and their other brother Joe walk into one of Macha's casinos. He is recognised and "all the tables are closed" to Jake and company. But Macha promptly calls them up to a private area of his casino where a high rollers' game is currently taking place. Jake bets Macha a fortune on a chip toss, and wins. This hurts Macha. As Jake says "nothing hurts more than humiliation and a little money loss". Macha suspects that Jake, who seems unafraid of him, will be out for more revenge. As Jake and his brothers leave the casino, a man hands Jake a card and tells him that he can help him. Jake, who has a fear of enclosed spaces, decides to take the stairs. In the stairwell he looks at the card and then collapses, falling down the stairs. The card is revealed to read "Take the Elevator". Jake is rushed to the hospital. The doctors report he is very ill but do not disclose why he had the blackout.  Macha puts out an order for a hit on Jake. Jake arrives home, without Billy, to be welcomed by one of Macha's hits. However, on his doorstep there is another card, which says "Pick This Up". As Jake bends to retrieve the card bullets fly over his back.  As the shooting continues, the same mysterious individual called Zach ([[Vincent Pastore]]) arrives and rescues Jake who is the only person to survive the hit. Zach introduces Jake to his partner, Avi ([[AndrÃ© 3000|AndrÃ© Benjamin]]). They offer him a deal: they will take all of his money and he will do what they say, no questions asked. In exchange, they will protect Jake from Macha. In the course of their proposal, they show Jake his medical file, which they have mysteriously obtained. It indicates that the blackout occurred due to a rare blood disease which will cause his death within three days. Jake suspects a con. The mysterious men later reveal that his money will be used to fund their [[loan shark]] enterprise.  Sam Gold is seen to be the 'king' in this chess game of gang warfare. He is the ultimate figure that all men are supposedly aspiring to be. Sam Gold is revealed to be an ultimately powerless cipher, whose power is granted only by those who invest in him. He represents ego and self-investment. He is the personification of greed. It is revealed that Avi and Zach were Jake's "neighbours" during his years of incarceration. They have forced Jake to "induce head pain to engage the enemy" by making him give his money away under the principle that "nothing hurts more than humiliation and a little money loss". They are inflicting this form of 'premature enlightenment' upon Jake because, according to them, he was not ready to hear how hard this process of liberation was going to be while in prison. It was because of this that they left without him.  Avi attempts to get Jake to understand the nature of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]. He tells Jake "the greatest con that [the ego] ever pulled was making you believe that he is you." This is seen to be the 'ultimate con', in that no-one wants to sever their connection with their ego, because they refuse to challenge their own lifelong investment in it. In the end, Jake also steps off the proverbial chess board by making a conscious effort to reverse everything his ego tells him to do. This is seen to be the truest and most fundamental application of the Formula. The characters of Jake, Zach, Avi and Sorter ([[Mark Strong]]) are seen to ultimately reject the ego's 'rules'. The character of Dorothy Macha is seen to succumb to them.  
Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles
  Takata Gouichi (played by [[Ken Takakura]]), an elderly Japanese man, has been on poor terms with his son Kenichi ([[Kiichi Nakai]]) since the death of his wife. When his son falls ill, Gouichi travels from the province of [[Akita Prefecture|Akita]] to the hospital, located in [[Tokyo]], but his son refuses to see him. Kenichi's wife Rie ([[Shinobu Terajima]]) gives Gouichi a video-tape so that Gouichi may learn more about his son, which contains footage of Li Jiamin, an artist of [[Nuo opera]] from the [[Yunnan|Province of Yunnan]] of the [[People's Republic of China]], promising to perform ''Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles'' in a year. Gouichi decides to travel to the PRC in his son's place to film Li's performance.  Gouichi arrives in the Village of Li, near the [[Lijiang City|City of Lijiang]], only to learn that Li was imprisoned after assaulting someone for mocking his illegitimate son. His translator Jiang Wen and the local guide Qiu Lin suggest that he film someone else, but Gouichi insists on Li. After an uncertain and time-consuming process of obtaining clearances from authorities, Gouichi gains entry to the prison facility, but Li breaks down in tears because he misses his son too badly. Gouichi decides to travel to Stone Village to retrieve Li's 8-year-old son Yang Yang (Yang Zhenbo). While in the village, Gouichi receives a call from Rie, telling him that Kenichi has been touched by his efforts, and requests that he come home. Gouichi wonders whether the message really was from Kenichi, and opts to continue his mission.  On the way to the prison, the vehicle breaks down, and Yang Yang chooses to run away, being filled with anxiety at meeting a father whom he doesn't remember. Gouichi chases after the boy, and the two become lost in the lime-stone hills, having no choice but to sleep in a cave. Yang Yang is hostile toward Gouichi at first, but trusts him as the hours pass by. They are found the next morning by the combined efforts of villagers and the police. Gouichi feels that Yang Yang's opinion should be respected, and lets him go home. Shortly after, he receives another call from Rie, informing him that Kenichi has died, leaving behind a letter saying that he has forgiven his father.  Gouichi returns to the prison with photographs of Yang Yang. Li is moved and promises to give his best performance. As he, the musicians, and the supporting actors are about to begin, he asks why Gouichi isn't recording. Gouichi explains that, since his son has passed, recording is no longer necessary. Li, however, persuades him to record anyway, given their difficulty in coming all this way, and so the performance begins in view of the camera.  The film revolves around the meaning of Gouichi's journey, and brings in issues of performance and duplicity, the authenticity or its lack in tourist experience, and the way in which success abroad can seem to erase failure at home.<ref></ref>  
Return of the Living Dead: Rave to the Grave
 The film opens a year after the previous film with Charles Garrison arriving at a mortuary with one of the canisters of Trioxin that he salvaged. He is greeted by a team of [[Government of Russia|Russian government]] officials whose goal is to destroy the last of the canisters to avoid another incident. Nevertheless, one of them sprays three corpses with the gas, and revives them. Charles, is killed during the incident along with the mortuary owner and one of the government officials.  Jenny, Julian, Cody and Becky, the last four surviving the previous film, are now in college and they receive notice of the "murder" of Charles. Julian and Jenny go to search for and possibly sell what belonged to Charles, and they find the last two barrels of Trioxin. One of them is taken to Cody, who tests the chemical inside it. Jeremy, Jennyâs brother, tastes the chemical when he thinks that it is a drug similar to Ecstasy, but he goes into a spasm, in which he foams at the mouth, and later describes what it was like. The chemical is named "Z" for its "zombie-like" effect on the living.  Cody, Jeremy and Shelby extract the chemical from the canister and they put the liquid extract into pills which they sell to Skeet, so he can sell the drug around the school. While Skeet informs everyone to only take one pill at a time for health reasons, most take more than one pill at a time (which speeds up the process that causes humans to reanimate as zombies).  Gino and Aldo Serra, the only survivors from the beginning of the movie, recognize what is going on when they are shown the severed head of one of the zombies, and they go to question Julian, knowing that he is familiar with Trioxin, but he doesnât tell them anything of the canisters that he and Jenny discovered. Sometime later, people are turning into zombies, and the drug is being passed around a rave, and getting out of control. Seeing no other option, Aldo calls in military assistance, but he is told that an American bomber plane is already on the way to the rave location.

Rings (2005 film)
 Some time after the events of ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'', [[Samara Morgan]]'s videotape has spread, as each person who sees the video makes a copy and shows it to someone else. A [[subculture]] has grown surrounding the video: people wait to see how close to the seven-day deadline they can get. When they grow too afraid to go on any longer, they show the tape to the next assigned person. During the interval, some create videos documenting their experiences to be posted to websites devoted to the videotape phenomenon. Groups that have watched the video are called "rings".  The film is focused on Jake Pierce, the latest member of one such ring. The ring has also recruited its next member, Tim who will watch the tape when Jake cracks. Eddie, a member, says that no one has ever been able to make it to day seven before cracking, and everyone who did has died. He tells Jake to make sure to record everything he sees. Jake is amazed at what he experiences at first, and Vanessa, another member, says she wants Jake to make it to day seven.  However, Jake's experiences soon turn scary, as he starts seeing visions of Samara suddenly popping up wherever he goes, and has a similar dream that [[Rachel Keller]] had from the first film of Samara grabbing his arm, leaving a bruise there. After several more unsettling experiences, he cracks on the sixth day, but Tim refuses to watch the tape. It is revealed that Vanessa is the one who made Tim refuse to watch the tape, as she wants to see what happens on day seven. However, this leaves Jake without someone to pass the curse onto.  By the next day, he's become so desperate he tries to play the video on the display models at an electronics store, but is caught and thrown out by a security guard who is a member of rings, and knows what the tape does. Jake begins dialing random numbers, hoping to find somebody to show the tape. Finally, he thinks of Emily, a girl he goes to school with. He invites her over without mentioning the video. Before she arrives, he experiences a vision in which Samara arrives and he tries to break the TV, though she comes out anyway. She reaches through the screen on his video camera and the vision ends.  An hour before the deadline, Emily agrees to come, leading to the opening sequence of ''[[The Ring Two]]''; Vanessa is seen encouraging Emily by nodding when she is making her decision to go to Jake's.

When she met Harsh, he offered her his riches, but couldn't offer faith. She got destitute and started having an affair with Ali, who in turn was also unfaithful. Things kept on going and she was about to get married to Ali, when Harsh got into their plans and tried killing Maya, but ended up killing the other girl Neena who was with Ali that night at Maya's place.  At the end, Rathod is being shown congratulated by fellow policemen, as he gazes into the eyes of Maya.<ref name=info>[http://www.movietalkies.com/movies/index.asp?MovieId=18458 Rog (2005) - Movie Information] - Movietalkies.com</ref>

Sahara (2005 film)
 In 1865, the [[ironclad]] [[CSS Texas (1865)|CSS ''Texas'']] carried the last of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]'s treasury out of [[Richmond, Virginia]], as Captain Mason Tombs ran a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] blockade.  In present day, [[Mali]], a civil war is being fought between dictator General Kazim and [[Tuareg people]]. [[World Health Organization]] doctors Eva Rojas and Frank Hopper investigate a disease spreading across Mali. Assassins accompanied by a corrupt Tuareg named Zakara attempt to murder Eva, but she is rescued by [[Dirk Pitt]], who is from the [[National Underwater and Marine Agency]] and was diving nearby.  Dirk's contact in Nigeria sells him a gold Confederate coin found in the [[Niger River]]. Believing this to be a clue to the long-lost ''Texas'', Dirk borrows his boss Sandecker's yacht to search for the ''Texas''. Accompanying Dirk are his partner [[Al Giordino]] and Rudi Gunn from NUMA. They give Eva and Hopper a ride so that they can continue their investigation of the disease before dropping them off as they continue down the Niger River.  Businessman Yves Massarde and dictator General Kazim try to stop the doctors from discovering the source of the disease. Kazim sends men to attack the yacht. Dirk, Al, and Rudi survive the attack, but the yacht is destroyed. Rudi tries to leave the country to get help while Dirk and Al go to rescue the doctors whom General Kazim was originally looking for.   After rescuing Eva, they try to leave Mali but are captured by the Tuareg. The Tuareg leader, Modibo, shows Eva his people dying from the same disease she was investigating. After analyzing the water sample, Eva finds out that the water is contaminated with toxins, and there is no treatment available for the sick people. Al stumbles into a cave with a painting showing the ironclad ''Texas''. Dirk believes that the ''Texas'' became stranded when the river dried up after a storm and that the same river that carried the ship now runs underground.   They follow the dry river bed and work their way to the border. On the way, they stumble upon a [[Concentrated solar power|solar]] detoxification plant owned by Massarde, which is the source of the contamination. They discover that the contamination is being carried to the ocean and, if not stopped in time, will kill everything in it. In addition, they cannot get their government to intervene during a civil war in a sovereign country. Massarde captures the group, keeps Eva and sends Dirk and Al to Kazim. The duo escapes but gets stranded in the middle of the desert. They find the wreck of a plane and rebuild it into a [[land sailing|land yacht]], which they use to reach civilization.  Dirk and Al enlist Modibo's aid to return to the plant. To cover up the existence of the plant, Massarde decides to destroy it with explosives. Fearing the plant's destruction would make it impossible to stop the contamination, Al goes to remove the explosives while Dirk tries to stop Massarde. Dirk fights and kills Zakara after a fierce battle. He rescues Eva, but Massarde escapes to his helicopter. Al successfully neutralizes the explosive, much to Massarde's anger.  The three leave the plant on an [[Avions Voisin]] C-28, but Kazim pursues them in a helicopter gunship. A series of explosions along the dry river bed reveals the wreckage of the ''Texas''. The trio board the ship, and use its cannons to destroy Kazim's helicopter. Modibo arrives with Tuareg reinforcements and forces Kazim's army to surrender, ending the civil war.  The plant is shut down, stopping the source of toxic waste, while the rest is dealt with. Sandecker agrees to do covert work for the government, who in exchange would fund NUMA. The ''Texas'' gold, which technically belongs to the Confederate States of America, is left with Modibo's people. It is heavily implied that Massarde is poisoned by an undercover US agent. Dirk and Eva start a relationship.

Santa's Slay
 On [[Christmas Eve]], the Masons, a wealthy yet dysfunctional family, are sitting down to Christmas dinner when Santa Claus ([[Bill Goldberg]]) comes down the chimney and kills them all in a variety of ways. The cast for the opening scene includes [[Cameo appearance|bit roles]] by several famous [[Jews|Jewish]] actors.  Riding on his sleigh driven by his "hell-deer", Santa arrives at Hell Township and decimates the locals in various holiday-themed ways. In one of his kills, Santa slaughters the occupants of a local [[strip club]], frequented by Pastor Timmons ([[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]]), a crooked minister, who manages to survive the massacre.  Later, Santa murders the local Jewish [[delicatessen]] owner Mr. Green, ([[Saul Rubinek]]), using his own [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]].  Meanwhile, teenager Nicholas Yuleson ([[Douglas Smith (actor)|Douglas Smith]]) is living with his crazy grandfather ([[Robert Culp]]), a crackpot inventor who has built a [[bunker]] in their basement to survive Christmas. When Nicholas asks Grandpa why he hates Christmas, he is shown "The Book of [[Nicholas of FlÃ¼e|Klaus]]", which reveals the origins of Santa Claus.  Apparently, Santa was the result of a [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] produced by [[Satan]] (just as Jesus was the result of a virgin birth produced by God--meaning that Santa is somewhat of an [[Antichrist]]). Christmas was "The Day of Slaying" for Santa until [[Anno domini|A.D.]] 1005, when an angel defeated him in a [[curling]] match and sentenced him to deliver presents on Christmas for 1000 years.  This means that Santa is free to kill again in 2005.  Upon arriving at the delicatessen, Nicholas is taken to the police station for questioning about Mr. Green's murder. He is bailed out by his girlfriend Mary "Mac" Mackenzie ([[Emilie de Ravin]]), just before Santa arrives and kills all of the officers.  Santa pursues Nicholas and Mac in a police car, but they are able to escape, thanks to a shotgun left in Mac's truck by her gun-crazed father (Jeff Hanna). They flee to Mr. Yuleson's bunker, with Santa still in pursuit. Nicholas and Mac manage to escape, care of Grandpa's [[snowmobile]]; but Grandpa is run over by Santa's "hell-deer" and killed.  The two teens hide in a local high school, hoping that Santa's powers will end once Christmas ends; but they are eventually forced to confront him in the [[gymnasium (school)|gym]].  They are almost killed by Santa on a [[Ice resurfacer|Zamboni]] but are saved by Grandpa, who is actually the angel who originally defeated and sentenced Santa. With Christmas over and his powers gone, Santa flees in his sleigh; but his "hell-deer" are shot down by Mac's father with a [[bazooka]].  Pastor Timmons is found dead in a Santa suit and is presumed to be the killer, while, in fact, the real killer Santa Claus is boarding a flight from [[Winnipeg]] to the [[North Pole]].  After the credits, Santa is seen looking over his Naughty List, when he looks into the camera and says "[[Bill Goldberg|Who's Next?]]"

Samurai Commando: Mission 1549
 On March 10, 2003, the Japanese Self Defense Force conducts an experiment which is meant to shield military equipment from the effects of [[solar flare]]s with the use of electromagnetic shields. But something goes wrong, and all soldiers assigned to the test suddenly find themselves stranded on a battlefield in the Sengoku period (the year 1549) and under attack by a [[samurai]] army. When the first men are killed, the unit retaliates with its formidable arsenal. And 74 hours later, a reverse effect occurs, and a wounded samurai warrior suddenly appears in the 21st century.  Two years later, former JSDF First Lieutenant and now world-weary restaurant owner Yusuke Kashima ([[Yosuke Eguchi]]) is approached by Major Mori ([[Katsuhisa Namase]]) and First Lieutenant Rei Kanzaki ([[KyÅka Suzuki]]), who inform him that his lost superior, Colonel Tsuyoshi Matoba ([[Takeshi Kaga]]), is actually stranded in the past and ask for his help. All over Japan, black holes have formed which threaten to devour the present; Mori and Kanzaki are sure that Matoba is altering history. Using the same conditions as before, a second team under Mori's and Kanzaki's leadership is to be sent into the past and recover Matoba's unit; Kashima is to act as an observer and liaison to Matoba. Kashima refuses to participate, but then Linuma Shichibei ([[Kazuki Kitamura]]), the samurai who had appeared after Matoba's unit had been sent back in time, seeks him out and asks him what he is actually living for when he is not interested in saving the world. This challenge rekindles Kashima's interest, and he agrees to come along.  As the recovery team arrives, they rescue a youth by the name of Tosuke (Akiyoshi Nakao), but also come under attack by both samurai and modern weapons, and, with some help from Shichibei (whose lord, [[SaitÅ DÅsan]], had allied himself with the attackers) they are quickly captured. The survivors are brought to nearby Mount Anmo, where a castle has been erected which bears somewhat improvised, but clearly [[anachronism|anachronistic]] features like an [[oil refinery]]. Soon, they meet the leader of the army, [[Oda Nobunaga]] - who is actually Matoba, who has grown resentful of his own time period and intends to write Japan's history anew. Matoba has established himself as a warlord and assumed Nobunaga's identity after having killed him during one of his first battles. Now, using a battery from the magnetic shield as a kit-bashed [[nuclear device]], he plans to make [[Mount Fuji]] erupt, thereby eradicating the [[Kansai]] region and establishing himself as supreme warlord. He approaches Kashima with the offer to participate, but the latter firmly refuses.  In the meantime, Shichibei learns that his lord has wed his daughter, [[NÅhime]] (for whom the young samurai seems to feel more than respectful reverence) to the warlord and that the new arrivals are to be executed. While Shichibei is wracked with self-doubt about the fate of his benefactors, his own experiences in the future and [[bushido|the duty to his lord]], Tosuke manages to sneak inside the fortress, where he comes in contact with NÅhime. When she learns of his resolve, she encourages Shichibei to follow his own heart and secretly prepares to free the prisoners.  The next morning, Kashima is to fight Shichibei for the freedom of himself and his men, but before a deadly blow can be struck, Shichibei tries to convince his lord to turn away from Matoba. Just as SaitÅ DÅsan orders Shichibeiâs death, Tosuke uses a commandeered [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]] to provide the soldiers a route of escape and their weapons. They manage to snatch the majority of their equipment, but Major Mori is killed covering Kashimaâs and Kanzakiâs escape, and Kanzaki herself is recaptured. With just about 21 hours left to return to their own time period, the surviving JSDF soldiers nevertheless decide to return to Anmo to stop Matoba. In the course of their planning, Kashima learns that Tosuke is actually the adopted son of [[Hachisuka Masakatsu|Hachisuka Koroku Masakatsu]] â a name which gives him hope for the future again. Soon, Shichibei returns to plead to his lord one final time and finally succeeds by appealing to a fatherâs love for his daughter, while Tosuke is sent to the emperor for an official authorization to declare Nobunaga a traitor.  The next morning, SaitÅ DÅsan returns to Anmo with fake news that Kashima and the remaining soldiers are headed for [[Kyoto]] to ask the emperor for assistance. Taking the bait, Matoba has the majority of his forces move out. As soon as this is done, Kashima and a group of his men, assisted by DÅsanâs samurai, conduct acts of sabotage and attack the castle guards. Kashima fights his way to Matoba, who is just about to launch the bomb, and finally manages to kill him, but the bomb is still set to explode.  As the oil refinery is destroyed, the explosion triggers an earthquake which destroys the castle. Kashima and Kanzaki are â along with the bomb â evacuated by helicopter and quickly brought to the point of entry, where Kashima hopes that the electromagnetic effects created by the time shift will cause the timer to stop. With only seconds to spare, they manage to return to their point of entry and are transported back to their own time; the time bomb is stopped and the present restored.  
The Sandlot 2
   The start of the movie flashes back to 1962 when Benny becomes Benny "the Jet" Rodriguez. The main part of the movie is set in 1972, ten years after the events of ''[[The Sandlot]]''. New kids have moved into the neighborhood of [[San Fernando Valley]] in [[Los Angeles]]. They have started playing baseball in the sandlot. The previous kids have all grown up and moved away. A young boy named Johnnie Smalls, the little brother of Scott Smalls (the protagonist of the first film), has heard the legend of "The Great Fear" (a beastly mutated dog, as he puts it when he later on tells the group about The Beast) owned by Mr. Mertle, who lives behind the Sandlot. David Durango (Max-Lloyd Jones) is the leader of the boys. Behind the Sandlot, next to Mr. Mertle's home, lives the Goodfairer family. Hayley Goodfairer (Samantha Burton), the daughter and her two friends initially befriend the other boys in a census to share the Sandlot, but their relationship burgeons potently into a friendship when they find themselves in a big problem with The Beast next door, despite Hayley calling David a little baby, and David calling Hayley a spoiled brat.  The next day, David and his friends Mac, Tarqell, Saul and Saul's deaf little brother Sammy (referred to as "Fingers"), repeatedly demand Johnnie to tell the girls to leave the sandlot, but they keep refusing. Johnnie then suggests that they share the sandlot. The others agree but David doesn't feel good with the idea. Although since the girls are amazing at playing ball, he plans to make a deal with them; that they have to be on their team, they agree. Friday afternoon, the kids play a game with a little league team. But when the team captain, Singleton (Reece Thompson), ends up hitting Hayley in the stomach for playing with them, David responds by punching Singleton in the face and forces him to leave, but not before telling him that the sandlot is theirs forever.  One day, when Mac gets an aluminum baseball bat, he hits the ball over the junk wall, and afterward they attempt to retrieve it. But just as they are about to cross over through a passage in the fence, Johnnie stops them and tells them the story of "The Great Fear": how it was born to bite and was different from its sibling puppies. There was a boy who loved the comic book hero named Rapid Rocket, and believed he ran as fast as him. On his first day of school, he went past the house belonging to Mr. Mertle (who forgot to lock the back gate where the Great Fear was), and The Great Fear got out and chased the boy. It was unknown what happened to him after he was cornered by "The Great Fear." Soon afterward, a wall made of assorted junk was built. Ever since, if anything went over the fence, nothing would ever come out.  The main conflict comes when Johnnie accidentally launches a model Space Shuttle. The model was built by Hayley's father, a NASA engineer.  It was said to be the future of NASA. Unfortunately, Mr. Goodfarier's rocket lands in Mr. Mertle's back yard (which is now the home of the "Great Fear").  Hayley, along with everyone else, frantically attempts many ideas of getting it back, including hiring the boy called "The Retriever" (Griffin Reilly Evans), but every time he fails, and decides to retire and go home. Then, just like Benny Rodriguez from the first movie, David decided to go over the wall himself to retrieve the rocket. (Here it is revealed that the little boy who was bitten by "The Great Fear" in the story was David himself.) He retrieves it and escapes the Great Fear's yard. The Sandlot kids soon discover (just like The Beast) that The Great Fear got loose. David then hops on his bike and rides out of the sandlot. The Great Fear then chases after David. David then goes through a construction site, and then David gets off his bike and runs back to the sandlot. David hops over the junk wall back to Mr. Mertle's yard and falls through the tunnel that Mac used to try to get the rocket back. The dog knocks over the wall and saves David from suffocating. When David defeats the dog, it's revealed that the dog's real name is Goliath; after that, the kids can be seen running to the sandlot because Goliath got away, and realize that he only wanted to get out to see his girlfriend dog, Tiny (who was also behind a fence). As all the kids are leaving, Hayley and David share a kiss, and Mr. Mertle, tired of kids thinking he's grouchy, decides not to build a new fence.  In the final moments of the movie, the narrator tells what happened to all the sandlot kids. Mac joined the army when he graduated from high school, and received a Purple Heart when he was injured in the Gulf War, and then joined the Peace Corps. Saul and Fingers started a record label for a "new" kind of music called hip hop, and they named their company Def Jam Records; with the money Fingers made in the music industry, he started a successful gum company known as Kissing Booth Bubblegum. Jenny and Penny both raised three kids and had a happy life with their families. Tarquel was believed to be abducted by aliens and was never seen again. Hayley became a supermodel and a pitcher for the United States Olympic Softball team, winning two gold medals in the process. David earned the nickname "Rocket" after he defeated Goliath, and he eventually went on to marry Hayley, while Johnnie went to work for the Jet Propulsion Laboratories, as rockets were still his life.

Saw II
 Informant Michael Marks awakens in a room with a spike-filled mask locked around his neck. A videotape informs him that in order to unlock the device, he must cut into his eye to obtain the key. He sets off the timer and finds the scalpel, but cannot bring himself to retrieve the key and is killed after sixty seconds when the mask closes.  At the scene of Marks' game, Detective Allison Kerry finds a message for her former partner, [[Detective Eric Matthews|Eric Matthews]], and calls him in. Despite not wanting to be involved in the case, Eric reluctantly joins Kerry and Sergeant Daniel Rigg in leading a [[SWAT]] team to the factory which produced the lock from Marks' trap. There they find and apprehend John Kramer, the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]], who is weak from cancer. He indicates several computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house; including his only known survivor [[Amanda Young]], and Eric's estranged son Daniel. The other victims are called Xavier, Gus, Jonas, Laura, Addison and Obi. A nerve agent filling the house will kill them all within two hours, but Kramer assures Eric that if he follows the rules of his own game, by simply talking with John, he will see Daniel again. At Kerry's urging, Eric agrees in order to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal.  The victims are informed by a micro-cassette recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house; one is in the room's safe, and they have the combination with the "numbers in the back of their mind." Xavier ignores a warning note and uses the key provided with the cassette on the door, which fires a bullet through the peephole as Gus looks through it, killing him. They search the house for more antidotes after the door opens, but with no success. After discovering a door, the group travel to the basement where Obi, who is revealed to have helped with the abductions, is forced into a crematory oven to obtain two antidotes inside. But inadvertently activates the trap and is burned to death before the others can save him, destroying the antidotes as well. In another room, Xavier's test is to go into a pit full of needles and retrieve the key to the antidote. However, he throws Amanda into the pit instead and though she is able to retrieve the key, they run out of time to unlock the door containing the antidote and he leaves out of frustration. Throughout the game, the victims discuss connections between them and determine that each has been jailed before; with the sole exception of Daniel.  Meanwhile, John passes the time with both idle and cryptic chat, eventually telling Eric that his survival of a suicide attempt after his diagnosis is the true reason for his games. With the little time he has left, he wants to inspire in others the new appreciation for life he had found. Not interested in any of this, Eric runs out of patience and returns to the monitors. He destroys several of John's documents and sketches at Kerry's suggestion, but fails to provoke John. As the tech team arrives, John reveals the connection between the victims: Eric has framed all of them for various crimes, and Daniel will be in danger if his identity is discovered.  Having left the others, Xavier returns to the safe room and finds a colored number on the back of Gus's neck. After realizing the answer to the clue, he kills Jonas with a spiked bat for his number after a brief fight and begins hunting the others. Laura succumbs to the nerve agent and dies, but not before finding the clue revealing Daniel's identity. Addison and Amanda abandon him, but Amanda returns after finding Jonas' body. Addison finds a glass box containing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the arm holes which are lined with hidden blades, and Xavier leaves her to die after reading her number. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the safe room which leads to the bathroom from [[Saw (2004 film)|the first film]]. Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them. Amanda notes that he cannot read his own number, and he cuts the skin from his neck. As he approaches, Daniel, who feigned his collapse, jumps up and slashes his neck with a [[hacksaw]], killing him.  Having seen Xavier chasing his son, Eric brutally assaults John and forces him to lead him to the house. John's sitting area is revealed to be a lift, which they use to leave the factory. The tech team tracks the video's source and Rigg leads his team to a house, where they find VCRs playing previously recorded images. As Kerry realizes the game took place ''before'' they found John, the timer expires and a large safe opens, revealing Daniel bound and breathing into an [[oxygen mask]]. Eric enters the house alone and eventually locates the bathroom, where he is attacked by a pig-masked figure. He awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe; a tape recorder left by Amanda reveals that she is John's accomplice and intends to continue his work after he dies. Amanda appears in the doorway, says "game over" and seals the door, as Eric screams and is left to die.  
Sarkar (2005 film)
 Subhash Nagre ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]), who is known by his followers as Sarkar, lives in [[Mumbai]]. The opening scenes show a rape victim's father ([[Veerendra Saxena]]) approaching Sarkar for justice (which the corrupt law and order system has failed to deliver) which Sarkar promptly establishes by having the rapist beaten up by his henchmen. His son, Vishnu ([[Kay Kay Menon]]), plays a sleazy producer who is more interested in the film actress Sapna ([[Priyanka Kothari]]) than his wife Amrita (Rukhsar). Sarkar's other, more upright son, Shankar ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]), returns from the United States with his love Pooja ([[Katrina Kaif]]) after completing his education there. Pooja's doubts about Sarkar's image cause Shankar, who firmly believes in his father's righteousness, to break up with her later in the movie.  One day, a [[Dubai]]-based don, Rasheed ([[Zakir Hussain (actor)|Zakir Hussain]]) tries to strike a deal with Sarkar; he promptly refuses on moral grounds and also forbids him from doing it himself. Rasheed tries to eliminate Sarkar's supremacy with the help of Selvar Mani ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]), Sarkar's former associate,MLA Vishram Bhagat and Swami Virendra ([[Jeeva (Telugu actor)|Jeeva]]). Meanwhile, they trap Sarkar by assassinating a righteous, upright, [[Ahimsa]] political leader and an outspoken critic of Sarkar, Motilal Khurana ([[Anupam Kher]]), and frame Sarkar for the murder. Everyone, including Vishnu believe that Sarkar is guilty but Shankar has deep faith in his father. Sarkar gets arrested and is imprisoned. Shankar now takes over the position of Sarkar temporarily. On learning of a plot to murder his father in prison, he approaches the police commissioner ([[Anant Jog]]) and asks him to arrange stronger security for his father, only for the commissioner to mock Shankar and his father besides not providing protection. Shankar gets a feeling that the police commissioner wants Sarkar to get murdered. Shankar and Khansaab, one of Sarkar's men, try to ask Selvar Mani for help to prevent possible murder, but Mani ultimately betrays them when he reveals that he is in an alliance with Rasheed. Rasheed prepares to kill Shankar and Khansaab but only Khansaab is killed when he decides to sacrifice himself for Shankar. By the time Shankar reaches the prison and appropriate action is taken, the attempt on Sarkar's life is already made. Sarkar is later acquitted. He remains bedridden as Shankar takes on Sarkar's enemies.  Meanwhile, Selvar Mani, Swami, Vishram and Rasheed try to convince Vishnu to murder Sarkar. Vishnu was previously thrown out of Sarkar's house because he had murdered the actor who was having an affair with Sapna. Vishnu returns home pretending to have repented. When he approaches Sarkar in the dark of the night with the intent of murdering him, Shankar foils his plan and later kills him (establishing justice by the way of his father and not shown in the film but viewer can guess after watching sequel/s). Shankar eliminates Rasheed, Vishram and Selvar Mani. He also succeeds in making Swami his puppet. Shankar has also realised that Chief Minister Madan Rathore ([[Deepak Shirke]]) was really behind everything; he had instructed Rasheed to murder Sarkar.This results in legal action against the Chief Minister. The closing scenes shows a woman approaching Shankar for justice to a fake encounter of her husband by the police and calling Shankar the Sarkar, while Subash is busy with family.  
Say Uncle (film)
 Paul ([[Peter Paige]]), a childlike artist, becomes upset when his godson's family moves from [[Oregon]] to [[Japan]]. Paul tries to compensate for his feeling of loss with visits to the neighborhood playground.  Paul's best friend Russell ([[Anthony Clark (actor)|Anthony Clark]]) tries to warn him what people might think if they see him hanging around their kids, but Paul doesn't quite see it that way.  As Russell predicted, soon Maggie ([[Kathy Najimy]]), a somewhat [[bigot]]ed local mom, launches a crusade against the naive Paul, with an army of furious parents in town.  
The Scorned
 Raina (Schneider) tells her best friend, Nichola, that she and her fiance Matt (Guiney) have been arguing. Nichola &mdash; who happens to be living in a room of the couple's beach house &mdash; assures her that it's merely "pre-wedding jitters," and voices a recurring line: "Your happily ever after is just around the corner."  The two return home, and it's not long before Matt and Raina run into yet another argument, resulting in Matt storming from the house in anger. Later that night, Raina awakens and begins to search the house for Matt. She is horrified to encounter him in bed with Nichola, and she storms from the room. The lovers slash her throat in the ensuing struggle. Mortally wounded, Raina stumbles into a pool of water, floating helplessly.  Seventeen months pass, and four friends decide to rent out the long-abandoned beach house together, completely unaware of its dark history. The four are couples, and are secretly cheating on each other. This, of course, enrages Raina's [[ghost]], and she disposes of the "cheaters" through the creative means of a staircase (DQ (Fairplay)), pulling them into the earth (Angie (Morasca)), and even through an explosive lava lamp (Seth (Lehmkuhl) and Jennifer (Cooley)). While the survivors &mdash; including the leading couple, Kirsten (Lewis) and Oliver (Hill) &mdash; desperately try to figure out what's happening, they soon find themselves dealing with an eccentric named Murry (Zohn) who uses their property to "communicate with Raina's spirit." Murry reveals that Raina is, indeed, responsible for the deaths.  Soon, Kirsten and Oliver find themselves caught between two stories &mdash; one from Matt, and another from the slightly volatile Nichola. Through both stories, it can be surmised that, immediately following the accident, Matt told Nichola to flee to [[Mexico]], promising to come rescue her once the entire problem was resolved. When the police arrived, however, Matt told them that Nichola had inflicted the wound on Raina, and that she had stolen quite a good deal of property. Thus, Nichola was stranded in Mexico and had taken the entire rap for the accident. Angry, she sneaks back over the border to seek revenge.  Meanwhile, Kirsten realizes that she has been acting quite strangely, and feels a strange connection to Raina. Murry explains that this is not [[demonic possession]], as it may appear, but Raina is merely making Kirsten feel what she feels. This leads to several instances of Kirsten acting quite strangely. For example, when Nichola tries to explain to the couple her side of the story, an enraged Kirsten blows up on her, and the two scuffle. Also, she has a vision of killing her ex-boyfriend Oliver, as he long ago allegedly cheated on her. This connection is vital to the storyline, as it compels Kirsten and Oliver to solve this problem, not retreat from it.  Kirsten and Oliver learn that Raina did not actually die, but is in a [[coma]] in a nearby hospital. Soon only Matt, Kirsten, and Oliver remain in the mystery &mdash; as the other characters met certain doom (Matt kills Murray after he confronts him; and Nichola gets dragged by Raina's spirit into the pool) &mdash; and it is at this point that Raina wakes up. Disoriented, she staggers for the beach house for the final confrontation. In a heated finale, Matt attacks Kirsten, who is saved by Oliver, and Raina is finally able to confront Matt. She utters what became the movie's slogan: "All those cheaters...they all deserve to die!" She loses her will to live, and she tears open the skin that has grown over the slash on her neck. Matt falls to the floor soon after, landed on the fire poker that he originally wounded Raina with, and the two die with their fingers interlocked.  At the end of the movie, Kirsten and Oliver remain alive and well, and have made amends. Ready to escape this mystery, they depart from the hospital.  The movie ends with a plot twist: Nichola is not dead, but in a coma, which she wakes from as the credits roll.  
Scooby-Doo! in Where's My Mummy?
 The gang goes to [[Egypt]] to surprise [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]], who has been restoring the famous Sphinx for the past six months with Prince Omar. However, the Mystery Machine runs out of water in the radiator. [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] and [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] try to find water for the Mystery Machine, and find a lake with a water which turns out to be a mirage. The gang meets an Egyptian nomad Amahl Ali Akbar and his hawk Horus. With their help, the gang is able to get to the Sphinx and meets "Fear Facers" host Rock Rivers whose show was recently canceled because he faked some footage. He then tells them of the curse. Scooby smells a familiar smell and leads the gang to Velma. Velma is surprised and introduces Omar to her friends. Velma then shows an ancient necklace which she found with the tomb of [[Cleopatra|Queen Cleopatra]]. Suddenly, a nasty grave robbing scientist and treasure hunter named Dr. Amelia Von Butch and her minions appear to loot the tomb.  Against the wishes of Velma and Omar, Dr. Von Butch and her team use modern equipment and explosives to open the tomb, unleashing a curse made by Cleopatra. The curse says that all who enter will be turned to stone. No one believes this until Omar is accidentally separated from the others. As Scooby and Shaggy return to check on him, they find him as a statue. Dr. Von Butch decides to enter the tomb anyway. The gang decides to solve the mystery. Velma protests saying this is too dangerous, but agrees to let them solve the mystery. Scooby and Shaggy want to guard Omar, but the gang tells them that it's a mystery with no split up. The gang then follows Dr. Von Butch. After accidentally setting off a trap, the gang is split up.  The gang, Dr. Von Butch and her minions are then attacked by the army of mummies, but are all able to escape. Dr. von Butch and her minions then separate. While investigating the entire tomb in looking for Scooby and Shaggy, Velma slips on the ground and drops her glasses. Someone gives her back her glasses who turns out to be a mummy and Velma ends up being attacked. [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]] and [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]] hear her screams and run to save her, but are too late: Velma has been turned into a statue too. Fred takes Omar's journal and Daphne takes the necklace.  Fred and Daphne try to stop Dr. Von Butch while Scooby and Shaggy discover a Lost City where they are mistaken for the returning pharaoh Ascoobis and his faithful manservant. Scooby then loses his collar. Fred and Daphne continue searching for Scooby and Shaggy until they bump into Rock Rivers and begin suspect him. They meet up with Dr. Von Butch and are all attacked by Cleopatra. Fred, Daphne, Dr. Von Butch and her minions are able to escape, but Rock Rivers is left behind only to be turned into a statue. Fred and Daphne leave the tomb and escape into a town which is close.  In a nearby town, at a bazaar, Fred and Daphne are attacked by a disguised Dr. Von Butch and her henchmen Campbell and Natasha where Fred and Daphne were hit by a sleeping powder as Dr. Von Butch steals an artifact from them. Later that night, Amahl uses an herb to wake up Fred and Daphne and tells them that Horus is looking for Shaggy and Scooby. Horus finds Scooby's collar and leads them to where he found it.  Meanwhile, the Lost City's leader Hotep, attempts to feed them to his Spirit of the Sand, a giant scorpion monster that turns out to be a robot he had built. Fred and Daphne arrive with Amahl, who reveals Hotep to be the brilliant civil engineer named Armin Granger who is illegally damming the Nile River.  After Hotep is taken away, Fred and Daphne tell Scooby and Shaggy about Velma. Daphne gives back Scooby's collar until she realizes that the necklace is missing. The gang finds out that Dr. Von Butch stole the necklace. The gang comes up with a plan. Meanwhile, Dr. Von Butch and her minions return to the tomb, but are kidnapped by Cleopatra and the mummies.  The gang leads an army composed of the citizens of the Lost City into Cleopatra's tomb to break the curse and free Velma. Dr. Von Butch is able to escape. In the chaos of the battle between an army led by Daphne (pretending to be Cleopatra) and Cleopatra's undead army, the evil Amelia Von Butch - who has now lost all of her team to the curse - sneaks into the chamber of Cleopatra, stealing the crown of Cleopatra and causing the Nile River to burst through the tomb, un-damming the Nile and flushing out the riches hidden in the tomb, thus restoring the treasure to the people of Egypt according to Cleopatra's last wish. Amahl captures Dr. Von Butch.  The mystery is solved when it is revealed that Cleopatra's mummy was really Velma, who had planned the whole thing along with Prince Omar and his workers in order to scare away treasure hunters. They had made cement copies of themselves to pass off as victims of "the curse". Dr. Von Butch and her team (who were never turned to stone, just copies like Velma and Omar), are taken to jail. The gang is confused why Velma kept that on a secret. Velma explains that she was afraid that her friends would get hurt during the mission.  Some time later, the restoration of the Sphinx is finally completed. When Shaggy fires a jumbo-sized firecracker, it hits the Sphinx's nose which once again falls off. Omar states that the Sphinx "looks better this way", and the gang shares a laugh.

The Secret Life of Words
 Taciturn, partially [[deaf]] Hanna (Polley) is a [[Yugoslavia]]n native working in a factory in [[Northern Ireland]]. She is forced to take a vacation by her boss, who tells her that her co-workers have been offended by her lack of socializing. After overhearing a conversation about a need for a nurse, she takes on a job as private nurse for burn victim Josef (Robbins). He is bedridden on an offshore [[Oil platform|oil rig]] after a fire on the rig, and has severe burns and is temporarily [[blindness|blinded]]. The rig is not operational awaiting an investigation, and few people remain on board.  Hanna talks very little, and especially does not want to talk about herself. Despite his pain, Josef is constantly making jokes, some of them humorous sexual advances. Hanna's care for him includes holding the urinal and washing his entire body. As they get closer, they start sharing their experiences. Unbeknownst to him, she listens over and over again to a message on his cell phone from a mysterious woman who was in love with him.  Hanna learns from a colleague that Josef was injured while trying to save a man who committed [[suicide]] by intentionally throwing himself into the oil-rig fire. Some other tragic connection between the two men is implied. He tells about a near-drowning experience because he cannot swim. Eventually Josef confides to Hanna his greatest secret guilt, and she tells him about her previous life in the former [[Yugoslavia]]. She describes in detail the horrors she endured during the Balkan Wars ([[Yugoslav Wars]]), including being [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] and repeatedly [[rape]]d. She shares experiences of the other women, including one that was forced to shoot her own daughter, and the slow and agonizing death of her best friend. She tells of her own repeated [[torture]] and lets him feel the scars on her body from the wounds inflicted on her.  Josef is not getting better, and at Hanna's initiative he is air-lifted off the oil rig to be taken to a hospital. When the helicopter lands, Josef wants Hanna to accompany him, but she walks away without a word. However, she leaves behind a backpack (apparently intentionally), and it contains enough information to give Josef a chance to find her. After he recovers, Josef travels to [[Denmark]] to visit a counselor that Hanna had seen after fleeing the war, seeking to learn more about her. He then tracks her down at the factory in Northern Ireland where she works. They talk, and at first she keeps her distance, saying she couldn't be with him because she thinks one day she could drown them both in her sorrow. When he tells her that he will "learn to swim," she reciprocates the love. Later, Hanna is shown in a home with the voice of a young girl explaining that Hanna now has two sons, whom the narrator refers to as her brothers, indicating that the woman Hanna described as having been forced to kill her own child was, in fact, herself. The voice of her daughter ends the film with the hope that Hanna will one day be able to live completely in the "now" and no longer be haunted by the past.

Gajraj continues to elude the Task Force, using more modern technology such as the use of cell phones. But the Task Force recovers and is able to monitor Gajraj's cell phones with the help of Prof. Tiwari. They find out that Gajraj is planning to contest the elections and if he wins, no police officer of any rank, even the Task Force, would then dare to arrest him or even consider him a suspect, which may well result in the Task Force being mere paper tigers. They have a final confrontation inside a train which leaves from [[Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station]].

See Anthony Run
 Anthony (no surname given) is forced into a sleepover by his mother in order to help him make friends. The trouble is, the "friend" his mother makes him spend the night with is a bully named Craig Randall. As he enters the house, his mother turns her car radio on, and hears a news report about a rash of kidnappings of children who were found alive tied up in duct tape.  For the most part, Craig is persistently hostile towards Anthony. His mother spends time preparing unappetizing meals that are supposed to be healthy, such as homemade tofu squares, fish heads, and spring garden loaf. On some occasions it seems that Craig is ready to become more friendly towards him when they find a shared interest in toys, video games, slime, etcetera, but then resumes his hostility.  Anthony's older brother John, is a [[Cannabis dependence|burnout]] who spends time with his idiotic girlfriend Jill, and his friends who are plotting to steal a parking meter and break into it for the money, presumably for drugs. Background music during his scenes consist of classic rock from [[Steely Dan]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Blue Ãyster Cult]] and [[The Grateful Dead]]. When Anthony tries to call him to come and pick him up, he refuses believing that his little brother should learn to be more sociable.  At dinner the rest of the family eats foods that Anthony finds unappealing. Craig's mother boasts of Lucy's upcoming role in a school production of [[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]], despite the fact that she's in the middle of a conversation. When Craig and Lucy's father notices that Anthony doesn't like fish heads, he suggests ordering a pizza, which shocks every other family member.  Before preparing for bed, Anthony walks in on Craig's sister, who he finds is using his toothbrush to brush her teeth. She compares it to kissing, then explains that she's fond of him because he upsets her brother as well as the rest of the family dynamic, sneaks a kiss on his lips and then runs to bed. Craig accuses Anthony of "trying to sex his sister," and threatens to either tell his parents or kill him in his sleep. Desperate to escape, he calls home again, but both his mother and his brother insist that he should stay the night. His mother suggests that the only way he can come home is if he asks Craig's parents to give him the ride, but when he tries to do so, he sees them on the verge of intimacy with each other.  Much to his surprise, his big brother has come to the rescue. John is convinced that by doing this he missed an opportunity for a sexual tryst with his girlfriend, but when Anthony informs him about the kiss he got from Lucy, he thinks he might have a chance with his girlfriend after all. Before they return home, he leaves a note on the Randall's kitchen window, which Mrs. Randall misinterprets as another kidnapping by the Duct Tape Gang. Police and news reporters surround the house, while Anthony sleeps safely at home on the couch.

Serenity (2005 film)
 In the 26th century, humanity has left an [[Human overpopulation|overpopulated]] Earth to colonize a new solar system. The central planets formed the [[Alliance (Firefly)|Alliance]] and won a war against the outer planet [[Browncoat|Independents]]âthose who resisted joining the Alliance. [[River Tam]] ([[Summer Glau]]) is conditioned by Alliance scientists into becoming a psychic and an assassin. She is rescued by her brother [[List of Firefly characters#Simon Tam|Simon]] ([[Sean Maher]]). During her training, River inadvertently read the minds of several top government officials and learned their secrets. Consequently, a top Alliance agent known only as [[List of Firefly characters#The Operative|the Operative]] ([[Chiwetel Ejiofor]]) is tasked with recapturing her.  The siblings have found refuge aboard the transport spaceship ''[[Serenity (Firefly vessel)|Serenity]]'' with Captain [[Malcolm Reynolds|Malcolm "Mal" Reynolds]] ([[Nathan Fillion]]), first mate [[Zoe Washburne]] ([[Gina Torres]]), pilot [[Hoban "Wash" Washburne]] ([[Alan Tudyk]]), mercenary [[Jayne Cobb (Firefly character)|Jayne Cobb]] ([[Adam Baldwin]]), and mechanic [[Kaylee Frye]] ([[Jewel Staite]]). Despite Simon's objections, Mal brings River on a bank robbery. River warns them that savage and cannibalistic [[Reavers (Firefly)|Reavers]] are coming. They escape, but Simon decides he and River will leave ''Serenity'' at the next port. Once there, however, a [[Subliminal stimuli|subliminal message]] in a television commercial causes River to attack numerous bar patrons, and Mal takes the siblings back aboard the ship. The crew contacts reclusive [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] Mr. Universe ([[David Krumholtz]]), who discovers the message designed to trigger River's mental conditioning. He notes River whispered "Miranda" before attacking and warns that someone else saw the footage.  Mal receives an invitation to visit from [[List of Firefly characters#Inara Serra|Inara Serra]] ([[Morena Baccarin]]), a former ''Serenity'' occupant. Despite knowing it is a trap (Inara did not argue with him), Mal goes to rescue her. The Operative confronts Mal, promising to let him go free if he turns River over. Mal refuses and, with Inara's help, barely escapes. River reveals that Miranda is a planet located beyond a region of space swarming with Reavers. The crew flies to the planet Haven to ponder their next move, but they find Haven devastated and their old friend, [[Shepherd Book]] ([[Ron Glass]]), mortally wounded. The Operative claims responsibility, promising to keep pursuing them and killing anyone who assists them until he gets River.  Despite the crew's objection, Mal disguises ''Serenity'' as a Reaver ship and travels to Miranda through a Reaver fleet without being attacked. On the planet, the crew find all its colonists dead and a recording by the last surviving member of an Alliance survey team ([[Sarah Paulson]]). She explains that an experimental chemical designed to suppress aggression was added into Miranda's atmosphere; the population became so docile they stopped performing all [[activities of daily living]] and placidly died. A small portion, however, had the opposite reaction and became extremely aggressive and violent beyond madness.  In effect, the Alliance created the Reavers and this is the secret River Tam had discovered.  Mr. Universe agrees to broadcast the recording, luring the crew to the Operative. However, the Operative kills him, orders the destruction of his transmitting equipment, and prepares an ambush. Knowing this, the crew deliberately provoke the Reaver fleet into chasing them and lead them to the Alliance armada in orbit of Mr. Universe's planet. The Reavers and Alliance ships battle while Wash manages to pilot ''Serenity'' through the crossfire to the planet; despite taking serious damage, he crash lands near the broadcast tower before being killed by a Reaver spear. The Operative's ship is destroyed but he manages to get to an escape pod and also heads to the broadcast tower.   The rest of the crew make a [[last stand]] against the Reavers to buy Mal time to broadcast the recording. Through a message recorded by Mr. Universe before his death, Mal learns of a backup transmitter, but the Operative comes across this message as well. Sustaining heavy injuries, the crew retreats behind a set of blast doors that fail to properly close. A Reaver shoots through the opening, severely wounding Simon. River dives through the doors to close them before the Reavers drag her away. At the backup transmitter, Mal fights the Operative, finally subduing him and forcing him to watch the broadcast recording. Mal returns to the crew, and the blast doors open to reveal that River has killed all the Reavers. Alliance troops arrive, but the Operative orders them to stand down.  The Operative provides medical aid and resources to repair ''Serenity.'' He tells Mal the broadcast has weakened the Alliance government, but while he will try to convince the Parliament that River and Simon are no longer threats, he warns that they will likely continue their pursuit in retribution for getting the word out. ''Serenity'' takes off with River as Mal's new co-pilot.  
Seven Swords
 In the mid-17th century, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]s conquer the territories of the former [[Ming dynasty|Ming Empire]] and establish the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]]. While nationalistic sentiments start brewing within the ''wulin'' (martial artists' community), the Qing government immediately imposes a ban forbidding the common people from practising martial arts. The warlord Fire-Wind sees the new law as an opportunity to make a fortune so he offers to help the government execute the new rule. Greedy, cruel and immoral, Fire-Wind ravages northwest China with his army and kills thousands of resistance fighters and innocent civilians. His next goal is to attack Martial Village, which houses a large number of martial artists.  Fu Qingzhu, a retired executioner, feels an urge to stop Fire-Wind so he sets forth to save Martial Village. He brings with him two young villagers, Han Zhibang and Wu Yuanying, to [[Tian Shan|Mount Heaven]] to seek help from Master Shadow-Glow, a reclusive swordsman and sword-forger. Shadow-Glow allows his four students â Chu Zhaonan, Yang Yuncong, Xin Longzi and Mulang â to accompany the trio on their quest. He also gives each of them a special sword he forged. The seven of them call themselves "Seven Swords". The Seven Swords return to Martial Village in the nick of time and successfully defeat and drive away Fire-Wind's soldiers. In order to buy time for the villagers to prepare for an evacuation, the Seven Swords head to Fire-Wind's base and cause damage by burning down their barn and poisoning their horses. During the raid, Chu Zhaonan encounters Fire-Wind's Korean slave girl, Green Pearl, and brings her along as they make their escape.  As the villagers evacuate Martial Village and make their way into the hills, strange things start happening along the way. Their food and water supplies are poisoned and their trail is marked by signs leading the enemy to them. The Seven Swords realise there is a spy among them and agree they must eliminate him/her before Fire-Wind catches up. Green Pearl immediately becomes the suspect because she does not speak their language. The situation is further complicated by a romantic affair between Chu Zhaonan and Green Pearl. At one point, Green Pearl and Chu fall into a trap set by Fire-Wind. Chu uses his sword to free Green Pearl from a net cast by Fire-Wind's men but loses his weapon. While Chu is captured by the enemy, Green Pearl manages to escape and convey her message that Chu has been captured to the other swordsmen before succumbing to her injuries.  The other six swordsmen travel to Fire-Wind's base and engage him in battle to rescue Chu Zhaonan. During the Seven Swords' absence, the spy, Qiu Dongluo, sets fire to the entrance to the cave to inform the enemy of the villagers' whereabouts. He reveals his identity and begins killing the unsuspecting villagers systematically. He is discovered by the village chief's daughter, Liu Yufang, who eventually kills him by accident. However, she is so traumatised by the experience that she becomes hysterical. Meanwhile, the Seven Swords defeat and slay Fire-Wind, and forces his army to retreat temporarily. The swordsmen return to the hideout, only to find that all the villagers have been killed, except for Liu Yufang and the children. Han Zhibang calms Liu down and decides to stay behind and protect the survivors. The Seven Swords realise the only way to save the ''wulin'' is to persuade the Qing emperor to withdraw the ban on martial arts. Liu tells Han that she can take care of the survivors alone so Han rushes to catch up with the other swordsmen as they travel towards the capital.  
Seoul Raiders
 Agent Lam teams up with JJ to track a pair of plates used to make fake [[United States dollar|American dollars]].  When the plates are captured and make their way to Korea, Lam gets on a plane and searches for the plates in [[Seoul]], tracking a man who he believes to have stolen them. During the hunt, he comes across JJ, who happens be a thief with a hidden agenda. When JJ thinks she has successfully walked away with the plates, she does not realize Lam has preempted her by swapping it with an empty case.  Lam goes to the [[Diplomatic missions of the United States|US Embassy]] with the plates to claim the $30 million reward offered but is outwitted by a staffer named Owen, who manages to drug him and flee to Korea with the plates.  Lam immediately follows Owen to Korea and meets up with a bevy of pretty Korean assistants. When Owen is about to trade the plates with "Black Bear", a top dog of the Korean underworld, Lam and his girls break in to thwart the deal, but Owen escapes with the plates in the nick of time.  Meanwhile, Lam bumps into JJ in Korea, and the pair decide to work together to take back the plates and split the reward. While Owen is immersing himself in a hot spring, Lam sneaks in and snatches the plates. He then uses the plates to lure Owen into his trap, arresting him in the end.  Only then does he realize that Owen is in fact a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[mole (espionage)|undercover agent]].  While Lam and Owen reconcile and decide to cooperate to bring down "Black Bear," JJ secretly retrieves the plates from Owen's hiding place but only ends up leading "Black Bear" to the plates and is kidnapped.  Lam and Owen has no alternative but to meet "Black Bear" in a deserted sports stadium to settle the deal once and for all.  
Separate Lies
 "No life is perfect â even if it seems to be," says James Manning, a wealthy [[London]] [[solicitor]]. When it comes to matters of right and wrong, he likes to think of himself as inflexible. Anne, his much younger wife, is accommodating and dutiful and likes the life they lead, the house in London, the [[Buckinghamshire]] hideaway. The couple seems to have it all, yet events soon will prove them wrong.  In the village, a neighbour has reappeared: William Bule, son of a leading local family. He has recently returned from America, a bad marriage and two children, whose ages he cannot bother to remember. Bill is indolent and insinuating and at the village cricket match he catches Anne's eye. Because of him, she suggests to her reluctant husband that they should have neighbours over for drinks. However, that evening, James has to work late in the city. Before the party is set to begin, a speeding car sideswipes a man bicycling along a village lane. The man is hurled to the ground and dies a few days later. He was the husband of Maggie, the Manningsâ housekeeper.  Anne takes a special interest in Maggie's well-being, but James can't understand her sudden teary investment in their housekeeperâs personal life. James, whose priorities have become skewed toward work rather than toward his wife, soon becomes suspicious that Bill may be involved in that fatal hit-and-run. When confronted, Bill initially denies the allegation, but soon tells James that the next day he will go to the police and confess, if that is what he wants, although he sees no benefit from his confessions. Back home, when James tells Anne about his conversation with Bill, she has also some striking confessions to make. Anne reveals one hurtful secret while making a salad: she was actually driving Billâs car when drunk and accidentally hit the cyclist.  While artfully arranging ingredients on a platter, she informs her already distraught husband that she has also been having an affair with Bill. Telling her story, she asserts that Bill doesn't really mean anything to her, because he doesn't make demands or judge her, as James does in little, incessant ways. Precisely because he's a lout, Bill makes her feel oddly liberated, if not loved.  As a Buckinghamshire police inspector questions the Mannings and Bill about the accident, James is torn between doing the right thing and maintaining appearances at all costs. James really loves Anne, and the couple takes a trip to Wales in an effort to leave the accident, their guilt, and their marital troubles behind.

However, Artyom cannot fight because he has eye problems. The doctor does not want to grant him permission to fight, but he asks her very pitifully, and, unable to endure the begging, she gives him the permit.  During the fight in the ring, Aryom receives a severe blow and his vision becomes worse and worse. Soon, he can only guess where his opponent is, and after a short attack exchange, he loses consciousness.

They are going to torture Artyom to learn where the money is, and then continue to torture him until he dies. But Artyom's feigned helplessness stills their suspicions, and they leave the room, leaving only two men there. Artyom asks them to fetch some water for him. One man goes for water. Artyom then calls another man and tells him that he stole more than 2 million dollars, he will not return the money to Valiyev so he wants to tell him (the second guard) where the money is. The guard bends down over his bed, and Artyom suddenly knocks him down. He knocks down the other guard and leaves the house.  During an open air play of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', a hired killer finds Vika. Artyom gave her a gun before being taken to the operation, so she pulls it out and points it at the killer, but her hands are trembling and she is not able to pull the trigger. Grinning, the killer slowly takes the gun and points it at Vika just as Artyom appears behind his back and hits him.  A bit later Valiyev finds Artyom and shoots him. Artyom is badly wounded, arrested and taken to a hospital. Next day the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] arrests Valiyev.  After some years have passed, Artyom's term of imprisonment is over. He is let out and is met by Vika and their mutual friends. Suddenly, someone calls one of his friends and asks in [[English language|English]] to call Artyom. Artyom answers. The camera quickly pans from the prison's walls to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. The caller is Larry, his opponent in the fight during which he lost ability to see. He says he knows that Artyom is free and asks him if he wants a rematch. Artem is silent. Larry repeats his question, "I said, how 'bout a rematch?". The camera quickly pans back and shows wild snowy field and far forest. Artyom looks at the field, smiles widely and lowers the phone and the film ends without showing the answer.  
Shades of Ash
 A convoy of trucks returns refugees to the âKalu Visa Pokunaâ village. The village had previously been ransacked  by the extremists who had killed men, women, and children and buried them in a mass grave. The refugees coming in the trucks are being re-settled in their village. This re-settlement is a Government policy to restore the normal lives of the people ravished by the war.  The village lake has been poisoned by the extremists. It has already taken the lives of several well-meaning and innocent individuals. Therefore, the village residents were highly dependent on the water brought from the outside to the village by a water bowzer on a regular basis.  To a village dominated by anxiety, poverty and mortal fear, two particular men arrive. One of them is a visitor while the other is a young man from the same village. The visitor is the new headmaster of the village school who has been transferred to this village due to political vengeance. His name is âGunawardaneâ school master. The young villager is âArmy Ajithâ. He has deserted the army since he couldnât obtain leave to complete his honeymoon.  As âArmy Ajithâ returns home with lots of presents for his newly wed wife, Komala, she is with another man in her husbandâs room. At the same time, Gunawardane school master comes to a school with no roof and inhabited only by cows. As Army Ajith meets with an accident after his traumatic encounter with his newly wed, Pema, her lover runs naked across the village and covers his nudity with the red cloth of the village kovil. Looking at all this activity intently is a little child named âUkkuvaâ, who had arrived just recently.  Ukkuva, a child who witnessed his parentsâ death and having lived as a refugee, he has been thrown off a truck as he was taken from one camp to the other. He has thus become a refugee for the second time at âKalu Visa Pokunaâ village. A prisoner who has escaped from the jail hides in âHeen Ekiâsâ house. As she comes to her old home as part of the re-settlement programme, with a life-size glass mirror in her hands, she is startled as the prisoner runs out, smashing the mirror on the way. The prisoner then hides in the village temple, which has  been completely deserted since its priests were killed during the attack by the extremists. He later camouflages himself with the dead priests robes and becomes a monk.  As âKoragramayaâ, the crippled village headman and Pema engage in various bad dealings, Ukkuva comes under the protection of âGam Bhara Atthoâ, whose cloth was used to cover Pemaâs nudity in a previous incident. âGam Bhara Atthoâ is the caretaker of the village kovil and has been blinded by an attack on the village by the extremists. Komala, the woman who had an extra-marital affair with Pema was his daughter and Army Ajith was therefore his son-in-law. After the accident, Komala brings Army Ajith into the village as a mentally diseased patient. The shopkeeperâs daughter, âUngiâ, develops an innocent and childish friendship with Ukkuva.  A woman called âNGO nonaâ, an agent from a Non-Governmental Organization, then comes to this village. She forms an alliance with the Gunawardane school master to do various business, being the only English speaking individuals in the village. Gunawardane school master entices Ukkuva by showing him some food and molests him. Ukkuvaâs guardian, Komala, then gets into a brawl with Gunawardane school master. Having no other option to feed Ukkuva, her mentally ill husband and blind father, she gets on the only bus driven by âAssa Peetaraâ and going past the village to serve as a sexual worker in the nearby town.  Heen Ekiâs only kin, his sibling brother, is brought in a coffin covered with the national flag and escorted by the army. The alms-giving is paid for by Komala, from the money she earns as a sexual worker, and is given to the priest of the village, a prisoner in hiding. NGO nona gets total control of the village shop, the village bus, the Buddhist scriptures at the temple and Ungi, who performed the rights of attaining-of-age to the schedule of the arrival of the water bowzer.  Ungiâs father, âPansal Godelle Mudalaliâ, the owner of the village shop who later disowns it at the hands of NGO nona, also loses his Kerosene cart to her and becomes her employee. At a later date, this same fate is experienced by âAssa Peetaraâ, the driver and owner of the only bus that connects the village with the town.  âGam Bhara Atthoâ on overhearing of the nature of his daughterâs profession from an argument between Komala and Assa Peetara, hangs himself on the rafters of the village kovil. Ukkuva who comes running to tell Komala about her fatherâs death, accidentally steps on a land mine and becomes a cripple.  In the aftermath of Gam Bhara Atthoâs funeral, Ukkuva practices walking using crutches with only one leg. As he does so, Pema comes fast on a bike along with a weapon on his shoulder and dressed as a village guard. He is being watched intently by Komala.  Pema comes over to Koragramaya who was in the temple grounds and an argument between them about Koragramaya sexually assaulting Pemaâs mother and then later even her sister, leads to Pema snatching the sickle from the priestâs hand and murdering Koragramaya in the holy ground. Moments before Koragramayaâs death, Pema grabs from his hands his appointment letter to the army. As the police come to inspect the death scene, the prisoner hiding in priestâs clothes runs into the jungle to escape. His robe gets entangled in the twigs and he runs into the woods, naked. Komala contracts a sexual disease. Ungi is returned to the village by the NGO nona after having been sexually assaulted. As crippled Ukkuva and Ungi, who was forced into woman-hood, are sleeping side by side, Komala leaves her two children and disappears beneath the waves of the poisoned lake.  The rain is falling down very hard in the night. Near the mass grave site, Army Ajith re-iterates the verses his father-in-law, âGam Bhara Atthoâ, used to say. As the darkness gives way to light, Assa Peethara lights incense sticks in front of the pictures of the gods in his bus. This same vehicle was once his, that is before NGO nona bought it and made him his employee. In the very first trip of the morning, Heen Eki, dressed elegantly, seems to be traveling to the town, as if to take the place of Komala. Assa Peethara looks back down the road. He sees Pema, well dressed for his first day at the new job and running towards the bus. Assa Peethara waits for his arrival. Pema sees Army Ajith and gets angry with having to see someone like him embarking on an important journey. In his anger he spits him on the face and gets on the bus.  Army Ajith who looks at the bus starts to laugh hysterically. Almost suddenly his laugh stops and he looks at the audience questioningly.......  the scene fades out. A symbolic toy acrobat jumper that switches hands from time to time, is seen right throughout the film. .

She's on Duty
 Chun Jae-in, an orphan-turned-police detective, is assigned a job to go undercover in a high school to befriend Seung-hee, the daughter of notorious gangster Cha Young-jae, and protect her from any of her father's enemies who may want to use her as bait to get Cha Young-jae to do what they want, as well as get information about her father's work from her. At first, Jae-in is very reluctant to accept the job; however, her uncle, also a detective, pushes her at the last minute to take it. Jae-in is considered a loser when she first steps into her class, and the gang girls confront her afterward and challenge her to a fight at the backyard of the school. Jae-in, being a policewoman, easily beats them up. This earns her some sort of respect, although what Jae-in really wants is Seung-hee's friendship. She eventually gets this with the help of Kang No-young, a handsome classmate and next-door neighbor who she starts to like; however, Jae-in thinks her crush is wrong because of their age difference.  Meanwhile, a new teacher arrives at their school. Jae-in later is informed that he is also an undercover agent, working on her side. She becomes slightly suspicious of him and vaguely recognizes his face.  One day after school, Jae-in and other policemen spot Cha Young-jae outside an airport; they rush to catch him, but his rivals are also on the chase. They meet up in the parking lot, where Cha Young-jae is trapped. Suddenly a mysterious motorcycle rider speeds into the middle of the group and his motorcycle produces white smoke, therefore allowing Cha Young-jae to get away. Jae-in and other police go after the motorcycle driver, since Cha Young-jae has already gotten away. The undercover teacher also happens to be at the event and shoots at the motorcycle driver, but the driver gets away. Jae-in rushes after him, but the undercover teacher puts a gun to her head. She assumes it is not serious and runs after the driver, but all she finds is a watch strangely identical to that of No-young's. When she gets home, she knocks at No-young's door and confronts him about his watch. No-young shrugs it off and is playful; however, once he gets inside his apartment, he takes off his shirt, revealing a bullet wound to the camera. Jae-in does not know of this, but she suspects that No-young is also undercover as a spy.  Jae-in increasingly becomes more suspicious of No-young, although she is still head-over-heels about him. One day she challenges him to a [[Judo]] match during a [[physical education]] class at school. During the match, they vocally argue, although none of their classmates or the teacher seems to notice; by the end of the match, they both know of each other's real position as undercover agents. Jae-in thereafter confesses to Seung-hee that she is not really a schoolgirl, which in turn gets Seung-hee very upset.  Jae-in then receives news: her beloved uncle has been stabbed by an unknown person. She sobs, overcome with grief at the loss of her only family. The camera then shows her with Seung-hee in a car with a fellow policeman. The policeman betrays Jae-in and Seung-hee and leads them to the site where Cha Young-jae has been captured and is meeting with a rival gang leader. No-young arrives, and Jae-in teams up with him to fight off everyone. Jae-in goes to capture the rival gang leader; however, as she is handcuffing him, a gun is put to her head. She turns to see the undercover teacher, who was supposed to be on her side. He reveals to her that he was the one who stabbed her uncle, and she becomes overcome with rage. Meanwhile, No-young is wounded and running out of energy; as an undercover spy, he cannot reveal himself, for he would get caught. He slips away quietly as Jae-in punches the undercover teacher again and again. A police officer finally handcuffs the undercover teacher and leads him away. Cha Young-jae is sent off to an emergency room in an [[ambulance]] with Seung-hee, and Jae-in receives news that her uncle will get better.

Shopgirl
  Mirabelle Buttersfield ([[Claire Danes]]), a transplanted [[Vermont]]er, is an aspiring artist and [[sales]]woman at the [[evening glove]]s counter at [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]]. Her quiet, orderly existence â filled with both the mundane (futon furniture and an aging pickup truck) and the serious (a large [[student loan]] and a supply of [[antidepressants]]) â is disrupted by the sudden appearance of two disparate men.  Jeremy ([[Jason Schwartzman]]) is an immature, awkward, socially inept, penniless twenty-something graphic designer for an [[amplifier]] manufacturer and aspiring [[type designer|typographer]] who enters Mirabelle's life first (in a laundromat). Mirabelle, aching for any kind of meaningful contact with someone else, gives him a chance, but it quickly fizzles after a half-hearted date (that she pays for) followed by a woefully underwhelming sexual encounter.  Ray Porter ([[Steve Martin]]) is a considerably older, suave, well-dressed, wealthy, divorced [[logician]]. Ray charms Mirabelle over the course of a few dates, one of which ends at his house. Mirabelle offers herself to him, and the morning after they have sex, Ray tells her that he does not intend for their relationship to be serious due to his constant traveling between L.A. and Seattle. Each has a different understanding of this talk: Ray tells his psychiatrist that Mirabelle knows that he is going to see other people, and Mirabelle tells her acquaintances that Ray wanted to see her more.  Mirabelle and Ray embark on a lengthy affair, during which time Jeremy is working as a [[Road crew|roadie]] for the band Hot Tears. Jeremy attempts to have one last liaison with Mirabelle before leaving, but she spurns him due to her relationship with Ray. While on tour, the band's lead singer introduces Jeremy to the world of self-improvement and how to better relate to the opposite sex. Mirabelle becomes increasingly devoted to Ray, who showers her with expensive gifts (such as paying off her student loans) instead of emotional affection. When Mirabelle's depression hits her hard (she has ceased to take her antidepressants because Ray makes her happy), he takes her to the doctor and cares for her, further deepening her reliance on him. Ray invites Mirabelle on a trip to New York, and Ray has her fitted in the dress shop at [[Armani]].  During a business trip, Ray has dinner with an old girlfriend. During dinner she propositions him and he accepts. Ray confesses the liaison to Mirabelle.  Devastated, Mirabelle ends the relationship, abandons her trip to New York and visits Vermont instead. While she is basking in the warmth and familiarity of home, Ray calls to apologize for hurting her and asks her to meet him in New York. She accepts. He takes her to a large party where she is the youngest guest, and she feels alone and out of place. When they return to the hotel room, Ray wants to be intimate, but Mirabelle rejects him.  After returning to California, Mirabelle meets Jeremy by chance on the way to an art gallery show, and they arrive together at the show.  Her coworker Lisa (who has been suspicious of the new clothes Mirabelle has been wearing to work) mistakes Jeremy for Ray. Jeremy's path of self-improvement has changed him, a fact obvious to everyone but Mirabelle. After the show, Mirabelle goes home with Ray, and Lisa goes home with Jeremy thinking he's Ray. The next morning Ray devastates Mirabelle by announcing that he plans on looking for a bigger house in case he meets someone and decides to have kids.  Jeremy calls Lisa thinking they have made a connection, but quickly finds out she has no interest in anything but Ray Porter (and his money).  Mirabelle permanently ends her relationship with Ray, deciding that she'd rather hurt now than later. She mourns the relationship for a short period of time, then comes out of it. She eventually quits her job at Saks and takes one as a receptionist in an art gallery. Jeremy pursues her again (properly this time) and they eventually fall in love. Mirabelle is invited to show her work at the gallery, and Ray attends the opening with his new girlfriend, the woman he cheated on Mirabelle with. Jeremy is clearly proud of his girlfriend and their interaction is as if they have known one another for years. Conversely, when Ray and Mirabelle finally interact, their conversation is full of recognition, yet noticeably strained. At the end of their conversation, Ray apologizes for how deeply he hurt her and admits that he did love her. Mirabelle is visibly touched by his admission and walks away. Her pain is short lived as she runs lovingly into Jeremy's arms. Ray watches the healthy, openly in love couple and remarks that he feels a loss even though he had kept her "at arm's length" to avoid the pain of their inevitable breakup.

They begin an intimate relationship, much to the distress of Grace, whose flashbacks become increasingly surreal and intense, a notable one being of her suddenly setting fire to a box of matches without touching them after her father had been trying to get her to move a flame in the same manner, and she begins to lose her mind. Luke begins experiencing visions of the girls' father as well, and decides to leave the mansion alone after Violet refuses to come with him. Grace attempts to reconnect with her sister, but Violet becomes depressed after realising she loved him.  Meanwhile, Luke encounters his girlfriend from the beginning of the film and they briefly reconcile, however he realises afterwards that he is in love with Violet, and decides to return to the mansion. Despite Violet's happiness, Grace grows incredibly jealous and begins cutting herself at night.  After discovering that she is pregnant, Violet finally agrees to go away with Luke, ignoring Graces' warnings. In a final attempt to get her sister back, she hatches a plan to seduce Luke while Violet is out. Showing minimal restraint, Luke sleeps with her, but regrets it immediately afterwards and begins to hate Grace, who doesn't hesitate in revealing what happened between them. Distraught, Violet runs out of the house but Luke follows her and apologises. The two decide to leave there and then, driving away as Grace watches from the window. The couple stay in a motel overnight, where Violet reveals her pregnancy. Luke concludes that he is happy and promises to get a job. The next morning, they begin making their way to California, however Violet drives back to mansion whilst he is asleep. Luke is furious that they are back, but after Grace calls a truce, he agrees to stay for one more night. Violet goes to the market to buy some supplies for a "celebratory feast", while Grace tells Luke about a painting of him that she needs him to pose for so she can finish it.  Grace has Luke stand on a table with his hands tied behind his back, and begins painting. Whilst doing so, she begins to hear her father's voice again, and it is here that the extent of her insanity is revealed. It is confirmed by a film that Grace is projecting onto the wall that their father abused them, showing him pushing her into their swimming pool and filming her struggle. Grace begins crying as she suffers severe flashbacks, gripping the paintbrush so tightly that her hand starts bleeding, as well as picking up her bow and arrow and pointing it at Luke. Having had enough, Luke snaps at her, telling her she is crazy, and attempts to escape, knocking over a candle as he does so, which sets the paintings alight. Grace has the same flashback about trying to move the flame with her mind, and fire grows as she hears her father's words, possibly proving her telekinesis, and suggesting that this is her final attempt to get rid of Luke. Violet senses something is wrong and returns to the mansion - just in time to see Luke die in the fire. Grace escapes unharmed.  After Violet has a miscarriage in the bath, she finally decides to leave the mansion once and for all. It is revealed that Grace is now pregnant, suggesting that she got what she wanted all along. The film ends with a heavily pregnant Grace knitting a babygrow. Her father appears next to the cot she has out prepared, but as she walks over she simply opens a window and goes back to her knitting.

  Four teenage girlsâCarmen, Tibby, Bridget, and Lenaâare best friends from [[Bethesda, Maryland]], who are about to separate for the summer for the first time in their lives. Lena is spending the summer in [[Santorini]], [[Greece]], with her grandparents; Tibby is staying at home; Bridget is going to [[soccer]] camp in [[Mexico]]; and Carmen is visiting her father in [[South Carolina]]. On one of their final days they went shopping together, the girls find a seemingly ordinary pair of jeans that fit them all perfectly and flatter their figures, despite their very different measurements. The girls dub them the Traveling Pants and decide to share them equally over the course of the summer. They part the next day, and the film focuses on each girl's journey separately.  ===Carmen Lowell=== During the summer, Carmen goes to her dad's house in [South Carolina]. On arrival, she is shocked when her dad immediately introduces her to a new family that he is about to marry into; they are blonde [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant], unlike Carmen who was raised by her Catholic, [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] mother. During her time there, her father and her new step-family neglect her emotionally, driving her to throw a stone through their dining room window, and catch a bus back to Maryland. At home she tells Tibby about her time with her dad and Tibby convinces her to confront her father with a phone call and finally tell him that she's mad at him. Carmen tells her father and he apologizes. Her summer ends with the four of them returning south where she is an attendant at her father's wedding, during which he makes a public apology for having snubbed her. She then accepted his apology.  ===Lena Kaligaris=== Through the unexpected intervention of the Pants, Lena meets a local Greek boy named Kostos Dounas. Lena learns from her grandparents that her family and Kostos' family are sworn enemies stemming from an old family feud. Despite this, Kostos continues to pursue Lena, and the two develop feelings for each other. Lena holds back, though, until one day when she admits to herself that she is afraid of love. Once she makes this realization, she begins a secret relationship with Kostos. On their last night together, Kostos tells Lena that he loves her. Before Lena can answer, Lena's family barges in, angrily pulling her away. Lena later confronts her grandfather and asks to go see Kostas before he leaves, to which her grandfather agrees. Kostos and Lena share a passionate kiss, and Lena confesses her love for him.  ===Tabitha "Tibby" Rollins=== While on the job at a discount department store, Tibby hears a loud crashing sound, and finds a young girl who has fainted in the deodorant aisle. She frantically calls for help, and the girl is taken away in an ambulance. When Lena mails the magical Pants to Tibby, they are delivered to the wrong house. Bailey Graffman, the girl who had fainted at the store, has them.  Fascinated by Tibby's movie, or "suckumentary" as she calls it, Bailey becomes Tibby's self-appointed assistant. Tibby is annoyed by this at first, but gradually grows to accept Bailey. She later learns from Bailey's neighbor that Bailey has [[leukemia]].  Bailey eventually goes to the hospital with a bad infection. Tibby avoids the hospital for a while, but eventually visits Bailey, bringing the Traveling Pants. She offers them to Bailey and pleads with her to take them so that they can help her. Bailey responds by saying that the pants have already worked their magic on Bailey by bringing her and Tibby together. Tibby spends a lot of time with Bailey in the hospital after that. A couple of days later, Tibby receives a phone call in the morning from Mrs. Graffman, Bailey's mother, saying that Bailey died in the night. Sadly, the pants cannot cure cancer.  When Carmen comes back home from [[South Carolina]], Tibby visits her to try to help her with her feelings of being snubbed by her father. Carmen lashes out at Tibby by saying that she has no feelings, and Tibby leaves in tears. The pair reconcile, and later go to Bridget's house in order to bring her out of her depression.  Over the course of the film, Tibby undergoes dramatic changes in her outlook due to her time with Bailey.  ===Bridget "Bee" Vreeland=== Shortly after arriving at soccer camp in [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]], [[Mexico]], Bridget develops a crush on one of the coaches, Eric Richman. She reveals to Eric that a psychiatrist who evaluated her following her mother's suicide described her as "single-minded to the point of recklessness," presumably as a way of avoiding dealing with her mother's death. This statement aptly describes Bridget's pursuit of Eric, despite the fact that relationships between the coaches and the campers are forbidden. She flirts with Eric and shows off for him during games.  When Bridget's turn with the Traveling Pants finally comes, she puts them on that night and walks around outside Eric's cabin, leading him to the beach. Bridget loses her [[virginity]], which leaves Bridget feeling empty and listless, even after she returns home. After learning about this in a letter, Lena calls Carmen and Tibby, and they arrive at Bridget's house to cheer her up. She tells them she is worried she is like her mother, whose mood also swung easily from very up to very down, eventually resulting in deep [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[suicide]]. Carmen and Tibby comfort Bridget by reassuring her that she is stronger than her mother. Eric visits Bridget and apologizes for his behavior over the summer, and tells her that while she is too young for him now, he hopes she will give him a shot when she is older, giving Bridget much-needed closure.

The Skeleton Key
 Caroline Ellis, a [[hospice]] aide, quits her position at a hospital and is hired as the caretaker of an isolated plantation house in [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana]]. The elderly lady of the house, Violet Devereaux, needs help looking after her husband Benjamin, who was mostly paralyzed by an apparent [[stroke]]. At the insistence of the family's estate lawyer, Luke Marshall, Caroline accepts the position.  After Ben attempts to escape his room during a storm, Caroline uses a [[skeleton key]] which Violet gave her, to investigate the house's attic, where Violet says Ben suffered his stroke. She discovers a secret room filled with ritual [[paraphernalia]]. Caroline confronts Violet, who reveals that the room used to belong to two [[African American]] servants who were employed at the house 90 years before. The servants, Mama Cecile and Papa Justify, were renowned [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]] practitioners, and were [[lynching|lynched]] after conducting a ritual with the owner's two children (from whom Violet and Ben later bought the house). Violet tells Caroline that they do not keep mirrors in the house because they see reflections of Cecile and Justify in them. Caroline borrows a phonograph record called the  "Conjure of Sacrifice" from the attic, which is a recording of Papa Justify reciting a Hoodoo ritual.  Caroline surmises that Ben's stroke was induced by Hoodoo, but believes that his paralytic state is a [[nocebo|nocebo effect]] induced by his own belief, rather than something supernatural. Taking advice from her friend Jill, Caroline accesses a hidden Hoodoo shop in a nearby laundromat, where a Hoodoo woman gives her tools and instructions to cure Ben. After conducting the ritual, Ben regains some ability to speak and move, and he begs Caroline to get him away from Violet.  Caroline tells Luke about her suspicions towards Violet, but he remains skeptical. They travel to a gas station that Caroline previously noted was lined with brick dust, which she was told is a defense against Hoodoo; supposedly, no one who means one harm can pass a line of brick dust. She asks one of the proprietors, a blind woman, about the Conjure of Sacrifice, which she learns is a Hoodoo spell wherein the caster steals the remaining years of life from the victim. Increasingly convinced of Hoodoo's authenticity, Caroline fears that Violet will soon cast the spell on Ben.  Caroline discovers that Violet is unable to pass a line of brick dust laid across one of the house's doorways, confirming her suspicions. She incapacitates Violet and attempts to escape the house with Ben, but Violet uses magic to chain the front gate. Caroline hides Ben on the property and enters Luke's office for help. Luke, revealed to be Violet's accomplice, brings Caroline back to the house. With strategic use of brick dust, Caroline flees to the attic (pushing Violet down the stairs and breaking her legs in the process), calls [[9-1-1]] and Jill for help, and casts what she believes is a protective spell. Violet, having caught up with her, reveals she actually trapped herself inside a protective circle. Violet pushes a full-length mirror at Caroline, which reflects one of the original owner's children, then Violet, and lastly Cecile. A recording of the Conjure of Sacrifice plays, and the two [[body swap|switch bodies]].  Violet (revealed to be Mama Cecile, who had been occupying Violet's body through the Conjure) wakes up in Caroline's body, and force-feeds Caroline (now in Violet's body) a potion that induces a stroke-like paralytic state. Luke (revealed to be Papa Justify) arrives upstairs, and it is revealed that Mama Cecile and Papa Justify have been conducting the Conjure of Sacrifice on new people since their supposed lynching. Because Hoodoo is supposedly only effective on those who believe in it, Cecile and Justify had to wait for Caroline to come to believe in Hoodoo through her own investigation. Emergency services arrive the next morning and take Caroline and Luke away, trapped in the paralyzed dying bodies of Violet and Ben; "Luke" (Justify) tells Jill when she arrives that the Devereauxes left the house to Caroline, ensuring that Cecile and Justify will continue to occupy the house.

Will is anxious about attending Sky High, located on a floating campus reached by a flying school bus, because, unbeknownst to his parents, he has not developed any super powers. On the first day, he and the other ninth graders are harassed by a duo of bullies: Speed, a burly senior with super speed, and Lash, a skinny senior with extreme flexibility and hyper-elastic body. Because of his lack of powers, Will is slated to enter a curriculum for "Hero Support" and becomes a [[sidekick]]. His classmates include Ethan, who melts into a fluid; Zach, who glows in the dark; Magenta, who transforms into a guinea pig; and Layla, who joins the class in protest against the two-track nature of the school's education system. The class is taught by The Commander's former sidekick, "All American Boy."  Will learns that not everybody gets powers, and there are such cases of those who have two superpower parents do not get any superpowers, such as the Bus driver Ron Wilson. The Commander is unaware that his son has been relegated to Hero Support, and shows Will his hidden trophy room. He is particularly proud of the mysterious weapon, "The Pacifier", which he took from his science-themed nemesis, Royal Pain, years ago. Unknown to either of them, Royal Pain, who had been presumed dead, watches them from a hidden camera in one of the other trophies. As Will settles into Sky High and makes friends with the other sidekicks, he comes into conflict with pyrokinetic student, Warren Peace, whose supervillain father had been imprisoned by The Commander. During a fight between the two, Will eventually manifests super strength, impressing Gwen Grayson, a beautiful and popular "technopath" who controls machines with her mind.

On the night before the dance, Gwen tricks Will into throwing a party at his house, and uses Speed to steal the Pacifier, which goes unseen by Will when he takes her into the secret sanctum. After Gwen lies to Layla, who shows up to investigate the noise and believes the lie, Will breaks up with Gwen, refusing to attend the dance, even though his parents were invited as honored guests. Later, he looks through his father's old yearbook and sees a student who resembles Gwen holding the Pacifier which he subsequently discovers has been stolen. Believing that the student is Royal Pain and that Gwen is her daughter, he rushes to the dance.  At the dance party, Gwen reveals that she is actually Royal Pain. During her previous confrontation with the Commander, the Pacifier, which is meant to turn its target into an infant, had malfunctioned, turning her into a baby instead, thus faking her suspected death. She has since waited seventeen years for revenge. With the help of Speed, Lash, and Penny, she takes over the school and uses the Pacifier to turn the faculty and students into infants. After returning to school, Will apologizes to Layla, and teams up with Warren, the sidekicks and Ron Wilson to try to save the day. The sidekicks demonstrate their heroism after Royal Pain sabotages the school's anti-gravity drive and their powers come in handy restarting it. Meanwhile, Will discovers that he has Jetstream's powers of flight when he is thrown off the edge of the school grounds and prevents the campus from falling using his two abilities. Gwen and her henchmen are defeated and arrested and the faculty and students are returned to their proper ages. His parents thanks all the sidekicks and admit they are heroes.

Because of frequent tardiness, Mike is fired from his job, and while watching more of Andromeda's video, he gets a call from his friend, John, asking him to hang out at a bar. Mike goes to the bar, leaving Andromeda to glare at him as he leaves. John does not show up at the bar and will not answer his phone, so Mike gets drunk alone, stumbles home, and vomits repeatedly. Unable to sleep, Mike pops in Andromeda's DVD, which now shows Andromeda with another bound and gagged man, who Mike is shocked to realize is John. Andromeda rapes John, bludgeons him with a hammer, and eats chunks of his brain matter. Mike believes what he saw was fake, until he is led to John's remains by images on his television, and a call from Andromeda.  Mike panics, and calls Carrie, and the police. Carrie does not believe Mike's story, and the 911 operator is doubtful as well, but promises Mike he will send a unit to his apartment. Back home, Mike's television is on, and is showing Andromeda molesting an unconscious Carrie, and slitting her throat. Mike destroys the DVD and unplugs the television, but it will not turn off. Andromeda then appears in the room, and seduces Mike, who asks "Do I have to die? I don't want this to end". Andromeda responds with "You're already dead" as it is revealed the two are on Mike's television, and Mike's mutilated body is lying on his couch. The officers called by Mike arrive at his apartment, but Mike's body is gone. Two detectives find Andromeda's DVD and magazine, and take them as evidence.  In a [[post-credits scene]], a [[Sex shop]] customer inquires about Andromeda. The clerk turns around, and is shown to be a gaunt Mike, who states "Oh yeah, Andromeda Strange. Yeah, she's hot as Hell alright. She's definitely capable of pulling some weird and crazy shit. But hey, I've got to warn you about something... her video is definitely not for the weak hearted."  
Sky Fighters
 The film starts out at the [[Farnborough Airshow]] where a demo [[Dassault-Breguet Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000-10]] is stolen. [[French Air Force]] pilots Captain Antoine "Walk'n" Marchelli ([[BenoÃ®t Magimel]]) and Captain SÃ©bastien "Fahrenheit" Vallois ([[Clovis Cornillac]]) are instructed to escort it back. When the rogue pilot attempts to shoot at Vallois, Marchelli is forced to destroy the stolen Mirage.  The French "Special Missions" department, seeking to blackmail Marchelli into working for them, tampers with the video from Marchelli's [[gun camera]]. A subsequent court martial finds Marchelli guilty of destroying the stolen Mirage without provocation and discharges him from the air force, prompting Vallois to resign as well.  Special Missions promises to have them reinstated if they fly a [[Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash|Cannonball run]] over hostile territory to the [[Horn of Africa]] to help sell the Mirage to an Asian customer. Marchelli and Vallois agree but are forced to land in hostile territory before completing the flight. They are captured by terrorists intent on stealing their planes. Marchelli and Vallois manage to escape in one of the jets, while the terrorists dismantle and make off with another.  The terrorists plan use the stolen Mirage to shoot down a tanker aircraft over Paris during the Bastille Day celebrations. Marchelli and Vallois intercept the rogue Mirage and shoot it down over an unpopulated area.  
Slow Burn (2005 film)
 The movie begins with Nora Timmer ([[Jolene Blalock]]), a biracial (African and European) woman, being questioned by Ford Cole ([[Ray Liotta]]), the [[District Attorney]]. Nora, who also happens to be the Assistant District Attorney, claims to have been raped by Isaac Duparde ([[Mekhi Phifer]]), prior to shooting him in the head in self-defense. Ty Trippin ([[Chiwetel Ejiofor]]), a journalist, interviews Ford in his car; Ford, anticipating both his first and second questions, surprises Ty by stating them to him before he asks Ford the questions himself. Nora narrates her version of the story to Ford, meeting Isaac at a music store, where he came on to her, asking to give her a ride on the rainy night they had first met about a week ago. Nora politely rebuffs his advances, but is left with no other option than to accept his offer, when left stranded in the rain with no cab to respond to her calls. Issac locks the door to his car when Nora tries to leave his vehicle upon reaching her home, only to give her a music cassette as a ''compliment''. Nora tells Ford that Issac waited for her in her house one night, grabbed her from behind, and raped her.  The plot thickens when Luther Pinks ([[LL Cool J]]), claiming to be an associate of the deceased Isaac, shows up to meet Ford and relates his version of the story, stating that Isaac's death was not manslaughter, but murder. He states that Nora had seduced Isaac into falling in love and ultimately becoming obsessed with her. He tells Ford about an '[[Saintpaulias|African violet]] flower' tattoo on Nora's backside to support his claims. Ford initially believes him, as he himself had seen it, making it evident that Nora had two lovers. Things get more complicated when Isaac's home is set ablaze and Ford receives an odd voicemail from the deceased suggesting a conspiracy involving  Nora and 5am '''''[This strange name does not resemble any thing in the cast list or in the rest of the article]'''''. Later, Luther tells Ford of a deal Nora supposedly offered Isaac for his cousin who was recently booked on drug charges: If his aunt agrees to sell her home to an interested party, his cousin will walk. Luther also reveals Nora's dirty little secretâthat she isn't biracial but is using being a minority to benefit her career and to satisfy some strange obsession with being black.  
Smile (2005 film)

Slipstream (2005 film)
 Stuart Conway ([[Sean Astin]]) has developed a hand-held, [[cellphone]]-like time travel device called 'Slipstream' that allows the user to travel back in time 10 minutes by interfacing with a cellphone system regional antenna. At first, he uses the device primarily to try, albeit unsuccessfully, to arrange a date with a female [[bank clerk]].  The final time he tries to use the device, a group of [[bank robber]]s commanded by Winston Briggs ([[Vinnie Jones]]) rush into the bank and demand the money from the vault. At the time, FBI agent Sarah Tanner ([[Ivana MiliÄeviÄ]]) and her male partner Jake (Kevin Otto) are in the bank tracking Stuart. Tanner initiates a gunfight against Jake's advice. Both agents are armed with pistols, while the criminals are wielding automatic weapons. By the end of the fight, Jake is shot and killed because he chased the criminals outside the bank.  During the fight, Stuart had been shot in the chest by a stray bullet. Before he dies, Stuart takes Sarah and himself back in time to before the bank robbery, and Sarah unsuccessfully tries to foil the heist. Unfortunately, Briggs takes the Slipstream device as a [[souvenir]]. Stuart and Sarah realize it's only a matter of time before Briggs and his cronies discover the true potential of the device.  What follows is a high-speed [[car chase]] of the criminals, a [[carjacking|hijack]]ing of a bus, a highway shootout, and a shootout in and downing of a [[commercial airliner]]. Near the end, as a passenger in the falling airplane, Stuart is able to reverse the entire sequence of events because, being airborne, he has access to many cellphone relay systems and therefore is not restricted to the 10-minute limit. Stuart rewinds time to just before the bank robbery, taking Sarah with him, but Briggs grabs on as well and is rewinded too. This time Briggs decides not to rob the bank as he knows what will happen and that all of his men will die and he and his men leave without anyone being the wiser. This time Stuart is able to get a date with the teller by being himself and escapes using the Slipstream device from the bank when he is about to be arrested. Sarah is relieved that her partner is alive again and decides to let Stuart go as she knows he's harmless. The movie ends with Stuart having fun using the Slipstream device.

Son of the Mask
 A decade after the events of [[The Mask (film)|the first film]], Dr. Arthur Neuman is giving a tour of the hall of [[Norse mythology]] in Edge City Museum. When Dr. Neuman reaches the part concerning Loki's mask, a man in black becomes increasingly anxious. Dr. Neuman mentions that Loki created the mask and unleashed it on Earth, and that those who wear the mask would have the powers of Loki. When Dr. Neuman mentions that Loki was imprisoned by Odin, the stranger becomes very angry and transforms, revealing himself to be [[Loki]]. The tourists panic and flee, but Dr. Neuman stays to argue with the angry god. Loki takes the mask, but realizes it is a fake. In anger, he removes Dr. Neuman's still talking face from his body and puts it on the mask stand, before getting rid of the guards and storming out of the museum in a whirlwind of rage.  Meanwhile, the real mask, which was thrown in the river by Stanley Ipkiss and Tina Carlyle at the end of the previous film, makes its way to a town called Fringe City, not far from Edge City, and is found by a dog named Otis - who belongs to Tim Avery, an aspiring cartoonist at an animation company, is feeling reluctant to become a father. He has a beautiful wife, Tonya, and a best friend, Jorge. On a tropical island, Loki is relaxing until Odin confronts him and orders his son to find the mask. Loki asks Odin to help him, but Odin tells Loki that this is his mess and he has to clean it up. Later that night, Tim puts on the mask for a Halloween party, transforming into a party animal similar to the mask character from the first film. When the company party turns out to be a bore, Tim uses his mask powers to perform a remix of "[[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]", making the party a success, and giving Tim's boss the idea for a new cartoon, resulting in his promotion the next day.  Tim returns to his house and, while still wearing the mask, conceives a baby. The baby, when he is born, has the same powers as Loki. Meanwhile, Loki is trying to find the child born from the mask, as his father Odin, possessing a store clerk, tells him if he finds the child, he will find the mask. Later, Tonya goes on a business trip, leaving Tim with the baby. Tim, who has been promoted at work, desperately tries to work on his cartoon at home, but is continuously disrupted by baby Alvey. In order to get some peace and quiet, Tim lets Alvey watch TV, which shows [[Michigan J. Frog]]. Alvey devilishly obtains the idea to mess with his father's head by using his mask powers. Meanwhile, Otis the dog, who has been feeling neglected by Tim because of Alvey, dons the mask by accident and becomes a crazed animal version of himself, who wishes to get rid of the baby, but all his attempts are overturned by Alvey. Tim starts to notice his son and dog's wild cartoonish behavior when Alvey starts harassing him.  Eventually, Loki finds the mask-born baby, and confronts Tim for the mask back, but is thwarted again and again by Alvey who uses his powers to protect his father. Eventually, Odin becomes fed up with Loki's destructive approach and strips his son of his powers. A seemingly-deranged Tim is later fired after failing to impress his boss during a pitch, but is able to reconcile and bond with Alvey. Loki, still determined to please his father, manages to complete a summoning ritual and appeal to Odin to restore his powers. Odin agrees, but only for a limited time, stating this as his last chance. Loki then kidnaps Alvey to exchange for the mask, but decides to keep him despite the exchange, forcing Tim to don the mask again to fight Loki. The subsequent confrontation is relatively evenly matched due to Loki and Tim-in-the-Mask possessing equal powers, prompting Loki to halt the fight, and suggest that they let Alvey decide who he wants to live with. Although Loki tries to lure Alvey to him with toys and promises of fun, Tim wins when he removes the mask and asks Alvey to come back to him using the human connection he has forged with his son.  Saddened and enraged, Loki tries to kill Tim, but his time has run out and Odin appears in person. Odin disowns Loki, calling him a failure, and begins banishing Loki, but Tim confronts the powerful Norse god and tells him that "the most important thing in life is a relationship with your family", and Odin accepts Loki as a son, accepting the mask from Tim as well. Tim's cartoon, based on his own experiences of a boy and a dog competing for the father's attention (with Jorge playing the father via motion capture performance), is a hit, and Tonya reveals that she is pregnant again before the film closes.  
Sometimes in April
 The story revolves around Augustin Muganza, a [[Hutu]] who struggles to find closure after bearing witness to the killing of close to a million people in 100 days while becoming divided by politics and losing some of their own family. The plot intersperses between the genocide in 1994, and April 2004, when Augustin is invited by his brother, HonorÃ© Butera, to visit him as he stands trial for his involvement in the genocide.  The film depicts the attitudes and circumstances leading up to the outbreak of brutal violence, the intertwining stories of people struggling to survive the genocide, and the aftermath as the people try to find justice and reconciliation. The plot is also intercut with scenes of [[Prudence Bushnell]], [[Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs]] for American President [[Bill Clinton]], and her futile attempts to stop the genocide and advice the American government and public to acknowledge the genocide as it unfolds.  === 1994 === Augustin, a [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] in the [[Rwandan Defence Forces|Rwandan Armed Forces]], lives in [[Kigali]] with his wife Jeanne, a [[Tutsi]] hospital worker with whom they have two sons, Yves-AndrÃ© and Marcus, and a daughter, Anne-Marie, who is staying in an all-girls [[Catholic school|Catholic]] [[boarding school]] 150 kilometres from Kigali. Despite constant political disagreement, he remains in close contact with HonorÃ©, a pro-[[Hutu Power]] radio personality working for [[Radio TÃ©lÃ©vision Libre des Mille Collines]] (RTLM). Augustin is also friends with Xavier Miango, a fellow Hutu officer and fiancÃ© to Felicie, a Tutsi.  By April 1994, the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|power-sharing agreement]] between the Hutu-dominated Rwandan government and [[Paul Kagame]]'s Tutsi-led [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) is breaking down as President [[JuvÃ©nal Habyarimana]] is viewed by Hutus to be conceding too far in favor of the Tutsis. Augustin and Xavier gradually come to the distressing realization that the military is preparing for targeted killings of Tutsis and moderate Hutus on the behest of Hutu extremists in the government, but Augustin insists on taking the position of a moderate and remaining in the country to Jeanne's disapproval, despite history of anti-Tutsi violence by hardline Hutus earlier in the [[Rwandan Civil War]] and warnings from HonorÃ© that violent action from Hutu extremists may recur. On the night of April 6, Habyarimana is killed when [[Assassination of JuvÃ©nal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|his plane is shot down]], reigniting the civil war and signaling the start of mass killings of Tutsis and moderate Hutus by [[gÃ©nocidaires]] consisting of pro-Hutu government soliders and militiamen backed by Hutu civilians indoctrinated by Hutu Power propaganda; Prime Minister [[Agathe Uwilingiyimana]] is later depicted to be assassinated by government soldiers the following morning. Xavier and Felicie seek refuge at Augustin's house in response to the outbreak of violence.  Fearing the safety of his family, Augustin calls on HonorÃ© to use his influence in the community to drive his family and Felicie to the [[HÃ´tel des Mille Collines]], which is harboring refugees, while confident that Anne-Marie is out of harm's way. As Augustin learns from HonorÃ© that he is documented as a Tutsi sympathizer by the government, he elects to stay at home alongside Xavier until it is safe to head to the hotel. On route, HonorÃ© manages to slip his passengers through gÃ©nocidaire roadblocks, but is stopped at an unexpected military checkpoint, where the group is detained and a scuffle ensues.  After a few days of hiding, Augustin and Xavier escape from Augustin's home and attempt to trail a [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda|UNAMIR]] convoy evacuating expatriates, but are separated from the convoy at a militia roadblock when the officer in charge of the convoy refuses to help. Augustin's life is spared but Xavier is executed as he has been branded a traitor on the radio. Augustin eventually reaches the hotel but is unable to locate his family, and remains there for the rest of the genocide. Meanwhile, Jeanne awakens without her sons at the [[Sainte-Famille Church]] over a week after the altercation at the checkpoint, unable to recalls events from that day. Felicie is later revealed to be lined up for execution by the church building.  GÃ©nocidaires eventually breach the school Anne-Marie resides at to screen for Tutsi elements. Martine, a teacher at the school, shelters a group of students, including Anne-Marie, in a dormitory. The students rally behind Martine in solidarity as Martine refuses to divide them into Hutus and Tutsis, only for the group to be indiscriminately slaughtered by gunfire from government soldiers. Martine and Victorine, a fellow student, survive and find Anne-Marie alive but mortally wounded; Anne-Marie dies later. The two soon find safety among the thick vegetation of the Kayumba swamps, where they are rescued by advancing RPF soldiers.  Towards late-July, the RPF has scored massive territorial gains as members of the Hutu political and military elite and Hutu civilians flee the country out of fear of reprisal from the RPF, ending the civil war and the genocide. Augustin seeks out Anne-Marie at her school, only to find Martine and another woman tending to bodies in the dormitory where the massacre occurred. He griefs when Martine confirms that Anne-Marie is dead.  === 2004 === Haunted by the events in 1994 and resigning to never learn of what had become of Jeanne and his sons, Augustin finds work as a school teacher and lives unmarried with Martine, who remains traumatized by her experience at her old school. Around the tenth anniversary of the start of the genocide, Augustin receives a letter from HonorÃ© expressing interest to discuss in person the fates of Jeanne and his first sons. HonorÃ© has been detained in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]], where he is tried by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] for his role at RTLM, after being on the run until his arrest in Italy in 1997.  On Martine's insistence, Augustin reluctantly flies to Tanzania to attend the trail hearings as a visitor, dithering to meet HonorÃ©. Furious to learn that those charged for inciting the genocide live in relative luxury with ample medication and meals while his countrymen still struggle to survive, Augustin begins to question the point of his visit. His stance softens when he befriends Valentine, another genocide survivor. She invites him to listen to her testify in court as an anonymous witness, where he hears of the constant rape she endured in the hands of [[Interahamwe]] militiamen. Valentine is revealed to be mothering two sons.  Inspired by Valentine's courage to testify, Augustin is motivated to meet HonorÃ©. At the meeting, HonorÃ© recounts the events that unfolded at the checkpoint to the hotel in 1994: The soldiers were ordered to kill Jeanne, Yves-AndrÃ© and Marcus due to their Tutsi lineage. Augustin's sons were promptly shot dead, but in their excitement, the soldiers presumed Jeanne was also dead despite only being knocked unconscious by a rifle butt. HonorÃ© hid Jeanne in a ditch, before carrying her to the safety of the church at night. For objecting to the kill order, HonorÃ© was listed as a traitor and lost his privilege for safety, forcing him into exile and being unable to aid Jeanne any further. HonorÃ© would later learn that while Jeanne was initially safe and pleaded to join Augustin at the hotel, she was raped by soldiers after the military began to probe the church for Tutsis. With the imminent threat of being killed, Jeanne sacrificed herself with a [[grenade]] to save a few rape victims and inflict injury on her aggressors.  Reflecting on HonorÃ©'s revelation, Augustin finally finds peace and returns to Rwanda to raise his new family with Martine, who is now expecting a son. The film closes with Martine laying flowers at the remains of the school dormitory before attending a nearby [[Gacaca court]] to recount her experiences in the genocide.

A Sound of Thunder (film)
 In the year 2055, the Chicago-based Time Safari company offers the permission for rich people to hunt dinosaurs in the past via [[time travel]] technology. As a precaution against the potential change of the past, the company preys only on the dinosaurs who would otherwise die of natural causes and keeps the clients from stepping off the designated path. Because of the dangers of interfering with the timeline, the company's activities are vocally criticized by Sonia Rand, the developer of the time machine software "TAMI", who feels disappointed for not receiving credit during her work and is worried that some clients may alter the past through their activities.  A trip with clients Eckels and Middleton goes afoul when the gun carried by team leader Travis Ryer fails to go off. The dinosaur, an ''[[Allosaurus]]'', rushes the group, scattering the clients. Ryer is able to kill the dinosaur and afterwards, regroups the clients and returns to 2055 without further harm. The next day, however, Members of Time Safari including CEO Charles Hatton hear reports of global increases in temperature and humidity, and Ryer observes a sudden increase in plant life. On their next trip, Ryer and a new group of clients find that the Allosaurus he and the team intend to hunt is already dead and the volcano erupts much sooner. The team quickly returns and reports the changes, causing the government to shut down Time Safari for an investigation. Ryer learns from Rand that Chicago is being struck by "time waves" that cause drastic alterations to the city as they pass due to something that happened on a previous expedition. Ryer and Rand narrowly escape a building after a time wave causes the appearance of thousands of beetles and a tree bursting through its structure. Rand warns that more time waves can be expected, and each will affect more advanced life forms, people being the last.  Ryer and Rand return to Time Safari to try to fix what has gone wrong along with the government. Unfortunately, another time wave strikes that leaves the city without power and now covered by dense vegetation. Evaluating the machine's logs, they find that the Eckels/Middleton expedition had come back a few grams heavier and that the bio-filter was turned off and recognize that they can use the time machine to go back to intercept their past selves so as to prevent whatever happened, but will only have a few seconds to act, and so must work to figure out who they need to stop. The Time Safari finds their equipment and gear free of anything, so Ryer and Rand lead a group through the city - now filled with evolved and deadly hybrids and other new hazards that kill some of their party members in order to find Eckels and Middleton. Eckels is safe but asserts he remained on the path, while Middleton, poisoned by the new wildlife, commits suicide before they can stop him. However, they are able to find a dead [[butterfly]] on the sole of the suit he used for the safari. The party makes it back to Time Safari after more time waves hit, now finding the time machine partially underwater and unusable. Rand obtains the hard drive containing the TAMI software with plans to use it with the nearby university's particle accelerator as a substitute time machine.  With Ryer and Rand as the only two survivors, they finally make it to the university, Rand noted that the appearance of simian-like Babboonlizards from the latest time wave means the next one will wipe away humanity. Rand prepares the accelerator and stays behind while Ryer goes through the time portal, just as the last time wave hits turning Rand into a humanoid [[catfish]]-like creature. Ryer catches up to the previous expedition, catches Middleton to prevent him stepping on the butterfly, tells team member Jenny that the bio-filter is off at the same time asking her to give his earlier self a recording of the events he has witnessed. The expedition returns without incident to the future they had left and Ryer shares the footage with Rand.  
Sophie Scholl â The Final Days
  In wartime [[Munich]], Sophie Scholl joins members of the [[White Rose]] student organization, including Sophie's brother [[Hans Scholl|Hans]], who are preparing copies of their sixth leaflet. They have [[mimeograph|mimeographed]] more than they can distribute through the mail. Hans proposes distributing the extras at university the next day; despite Willi arguing that the risks are unacceptable, Hans says that he will take full responsibility, and Sophie volunteers to assist.  The next day, Sophie carries a small suitcase as she and Hans walk to the main building of [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich University]]. In the building, where classes are in session, they set about putting down stacks of leaflets near the doors of lecture rooms. With only minutes left until the period ends, Sophie runs to the top floor, where she sets a stack of leaflets on the balustrade, then impulsively pushes them over the edge. As Hans and Sophie try to leave, a janitor who saw Sophie scatter the leaflets shouts at them to stop, and detains them until police arrive and arrest them.  The siblings are taken to the Munich [[Stadelheim Prison]], where Sophie is interrogated by [[Gestapo]] investigator [[Robert Mohr (Gestapo)|Robert Mohr]]. Claiming initially to be apolitical, she presents an elaborate alibi: she and her brother had nothing to do with the fliers; she noticed them in the hall and pushed a stack off the railing because it is in her nature to play pranks; and she had an empty suitcase because she was going to visit her parents in [[Ulm]] and planned to bring back some clothes. Her deception seems to be working; she is dismissed. As her release form is about to be approved, though, the order comes to not let her go. She is placed in a prison cell with fellow prisoner Else Gebel.  The investigation has found incontrovertible evidence that Sophie and Hans were indeed responsible for the distribution of anti-Nazi leaflets. Sophie concedes her involvement (as has Hans) but, determined to protect the others, steadfastly maintains that the production and distribution of thousands of copies of leaflets in cities throughout the region were entirely the work of Hans and herself. Mohr admonishes her to support the laws that preserve order in a society that has funded her education; Scholl counters that before 1933 the laws preserved the [[Freedom of speech|right of free speech]], and describes atrocities committed by the Nazis, both ones she has seen and ones she has heard of (including reports of [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] from soldiers returning from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]). When she says that she is willing to accept all blame, and refuses to name accomplices, Mohr ends the interrogation.  Sophie, her brother and a married friend with three young children, [[Christoph Probst]], are charged with [[treason]], troop demoralization and abetting the enemy. In the subsequent [[show trial]], Probst is the first to be examined by President of the People's Court [[Roland Freisler]], whose prosecutorial zeal makes the nominal prosecutor superfluous. Freisler contemptuously dismisses Probst's appeals to spare his life so that his children can have a father.  Hans maintains his composure in the face of Freisler's increasingly impatient questioning. Declining to answer only what he is asked, he argues that the defeat of the Nazi state has been made inevitable by the [[Allies of World War II|alliance]] of the [[Soviet Union]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]]; all Hitler can do is prolong the war. In her own examination, Sophie declares that many people agree with what she and her group have said and written, but they dare not express such thoughts. Freisler pronounces the three defendants guilty and calls on each to make a brief final statement. Sophie tells the court that âwhere we stand today, you [Freisler] will stand soon.â All are sentenced to death.  Sophie, who had been told that everyone had 99 days after conviction before they were executed, learns that she is to be executed that day. After a visit by her parents, who express their approval of what she has done, Mohr comes to the prison and sadly watches Sophie taken away. Soon after, she is led into a cell where Christoph Probst and Hans await. They quietly share a cigarette, then embrace. Probst remarks that what they did was not in vain. As Sophie is led into a courtyard, she says, "The sun is still shining". She is brought to the execution chamber and placed in a guillotine. The blade falls and the picture goes black. Footsteps are heard, then Hans's voice exclaiming "Es lebe die Freiheit!" ("Long live Freedom!") before the blade falls again. Probst is brought in next, breathing heavily, before the blade falls once more.  In the closing shot, thousands of leaflets fall from the sky over Munich. A title explains that copies of the White Rose manifesto were smuggled to [[Scandinavia]] and then to [[England]], where the Allies printed millions of copies of the "Manifesto of the Students of Munich" that were subsequently dropped on German cities. The first frames of the credits list the names of the seven members of the White Rose group who were executed, more than a dozen who were imprisoned, and supporters and sympathizers who received draconian punishments.

The Squid and the Whale
 Bernard Berkman is an arrogant, once-promising novelist whose career has gone into a slow decline as he spends more time teaching and less time writing. His unfaithful wife, Joan, has recently begun publishing her own work to widespread acclaim, which only increases the growing tension between them. One day, Bernard and Joan tell their two sons, 16-year-old Walt and 12-year-old Frank, that they are separating, with Bernard renting a house on the other side of [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] from their home in [[Park Slope, Brooklyn]].  As the parents set up a schedule for spending time with their children, Walt and Frank can hardly imagine that things could get more combative between their parents. They do, however, as Joan begins dating Ivan, Frank's tennis instructor, and Bernard starts sharing his new house with Lili, one of his students. Meanwhile, the two boys begin taking sides in the battle between their parents, with Frank siding with his mother and Walt lashing out at her.  Along with the trouble both boys exhibit verbally with their parents, they also show internal struggles and very different ways of handling the stress of their parents' divorce.  Walt's most obvious cry for help is when he performs and claims to have written [[Hey You (Pink Floyd song)|"Hey You"]] by [[Pink Floyd]] at his school's talent show.  After Walt wins first place and receives praise from his family and friends, his school realizes that he did not write the song.  At this point, the school calls Bernard and Joan in to discuss Walt. They all decide that Walt should see the school psychologist.  Meanwhile, Frank exhibits his own internal turmoil by repeatedly masturbating at school.  He also begins to drink beer and speak in a way that emulates Ivan's mannerisms.  During the meeting with the psychologist, Walt finally starts to see things more objectively, without the taint of his father's opinions. He realizes that he had been emulating Bernard's rude and arrogant behavior when he mistreats a girl he had been dating named Sophie, who breaks things off with him when she finally gets fed up with his narcissism and cruel treatment of her. The psychologist asks Walt about his childhood memories and it becomes clear to Walt that his father was never really present, and that his mother was the one whom he remembers caring for him.  His fondest childhood memory is when his mother would take him to see the [[American Museum of Natural History#Milstein Hall of Ocean Life|giant squid and whale exhibit]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]; the exhibit scared him as a small child so he would look at it through his fingers whenever they went by the exhibit at the museum.  After a heated argument between Bernard and Joan over custody, Bernard collapses on the street outside their home and is taken to the hospital. Bernard asks for Walt to stay by his side, but Walt instead runs to visit the squid and whale. The film concludes with him pondering the exhibit.

Spring Snow (film)
 Spring Snow starts in 1912, as [[Emperor TaishÅ]] begins [[TaishÅ period|his short reign]] and Japan's upper classes (''[[kazoku]]'') are mimicking the tastes and manners of [[Europe]]'s [[aristocrat]]s. Among them are two children, Kiyoaki Matsugae ([[Satoshi Tsumabuki]]) who is the only son of the [[Marquess]] Matsugae and Satoko Ayakura ([[YÅ«ko Takeuchi]]) who is the only daughter of the [[Earl]] Ayakura.  Even as a child, Satoko had romantic aspirations for her friendship with Kiyoaki. However, her father ([[KenjirÅ Ishimaru]]), wary of the womanizing ways of Kiyoaki's father ([[Takaaki Enoki]]), fears for his daughter's involvement. He instructs her tutor, Tadeshina (Michiyo Ookusu), to ensure the girl's heart is not broken.  A decade later, as Kiyoaki is finishing [[GakushÅ«in]] high school, the beautiful and eligible Satoko is still stuck on her childhood sweetheart. To avoid her, Kiyoaki playfully considers setting her up with his uptight school friend, Shigekuni Honda ([[Sousuke Takaoka]]), and writes a lurid confession of frequent trips to [[Tokyo]]'s entertainment (the theatre of ''[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s [[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'') quarter, then posts the letter to Satoko before Shigekuni can stop him. That evening, Kiyoaki has second thoughts, and requests the letter be destroyed, as his decadent adventures were fabrications.  
SPL: Sha Po Lang
 The movie is set before 1997, prior to the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|return of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China]]. Chan Kwok-chung (Simon Yam), a Hong Kong police inspector, has dedicated his career to putting Wong Po (Sammo Hung), a notorious [[Triad (underground society)|triad]] boss, behind bars. While escorting a witness with damning evidence of Wong's wrongdoings to court, Chan's car is rammed by another car driven by Jack (Wu Jing), a ruthless assassin. Jack proceeds to kill the wounded witness and his wife, but spares their young daughter. Chan survives with a piece of glass stuck in his head. After the glass is removed, the doctor informs Chan of a tumor in his brain that will soon kill him. Chan becomes even more determined to bring down Wong Po, using any means necessary.  Three years later, Ma Kwun (Donnie Yen), a police officer from another precinct, is assigned to replace Chan, who is going to retire soon. Ma will lead Chan's team, composed of Wah, Sum and Lok. The three men are very protective of Chan, who has since adopted the slain witness' daughter.  An electronics shop owner brings to the police station a video tape of Wong Po torturing an undercover agent. In the video, Wong hits the agent repeatedly with a golf club, then one of his men finishes him off. Chan and his colleagues decide to alter the tape, intimidate the shop owner into accusing Wong Po of being the murderer, and eliminate the real killer. Ma, who once beat up a drug trafficker so badly that the latter has become mentally handicapped, has vowed to abstain from using questionable means in his career. He is upset when he sees Chan and his colleagues resorting to use underhanded means to frame Wong Po for murder. He witnesses Chan's team murdering the henchman that killed the undercover agent, and confronts the four of them, resulting in a brief fight. Despite their disagreements, Ma still assists Chan and the team later in the arrest of Wong Po.  The group receives a message warning them against leaving the police station that night. Ignoring the threat, Lok goes to buy a gun to serve as Wong Po's "murder weapon", but is trapped in an enclosed area and ends up getting killed by a knife wielding Jack. Meanwhile, a copy of the original video tape is given to Chan's superior, Cheung Chun-fei. Seeing that Chan had tampered with evidence to frame Wong Po, Cheung releases Wong and tries to arrest Chan. An elderly policeman called Uncle Ba helps Chan avoid arrest. Later that night, Jack sneaks up on Wah and Sum and stabs them to death. Ma rushes to save them but arrives too late. Before dying, Wah confesses to Ma that he, Sum and Lok had stolen money from Wong Po (when they busted one of Wong's drug operations earlier) to help Chan raise his adopted daughter, and were targeted for retaliation by Wong.  At the station, Ma has a heated argument with Cheung over the handling of the case. Furious, he turns in his badge and gun. Chan goes to Wong Po's office with the stolen money. He shoots a few henchmen but is stabbed and overpowered by Jack, then tortured by Wong Po, who calls Ma and tells him that he has taken Chan captive.  Ma then heads to Wong Po's office and encounters Jack in a back alley. After an intense battle, Jack wrestles Ma's baton away from him, but Ma manages to eviscerate Jack with his own knife. In Wong Po's office, he fights Wong and seemingly kills the crime lord by slamming him onto a tall glass display of bottles. Ma sits down at the bar and starts to pour himself a drink. However, Wong suddenly gets up and throws Ma out of the window. Ma lands on the car carrying Wong's wife and baby son, caving in the roof. All three are killed instantly. Wong gazes down at Ma's body and recognizes the car underneath. He slumps down and starts sobbing, broken with grief.  In the final scene, Chan and his adopted daughter are seen on the beach, with the girl playing near the shore. Chan finally succumbs to his tumour and dies.

The Caped Crusader tells him that he is really angry that no one cares about him anymore and that everyone only wants spiders nowadays. He no longer has the [[Batmobile]], owning only a dilapidated "Bat-[[Renault Clio|Clio]]". Even [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] has abandoned him. "Apparently he was only in it for the money." Piper tries to help Batman but tells him he has much more important things to do. Suddenly Batman tells Piper that he has kidnapped Jane-Mary and demands him to give up being a Super Hero or she will die but luckily Piper quickly guesses that Batman has trapped her on top of the [[Tower Bridge]] and rushes off to save her.  Spider-Plant Man swings through London, wondering where Tower Bridge is, while Batman, who couldn't get his Bat-Clio to start, takes the [[London Underground|Underground]] to Tower Bridge.

Batman's sidekick [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (played by [[Tony Robinson]]) arrives, and makes a deal with Batman for 20% of the profits on Batman products and a Robinmobile and starts attacking Piper. Whilst hanging from Tower Bridge, Spider-Plant Man makes a deal with Robin for  25% on all [[pajama]] sales and his own cereal brand with real marshmallows, Robin switches sides and attacks Batman. Batman is punched off the tower and lands on the reporter. He then punches a Fathers 4 Justice supporter and hijacks a little kid's [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]] and gets away.  Spider-Plant Man and Jane-Mary start to kiss. Robin tells Peter it's time to go and moments later Peter punches him. He then asks Jane-Mary whether she will marry him, and she responds, "Who's asking me, Spider-Plant Man or the man behind the spandex?" He replies, "You choose". Jane-Mary is then shown lying in the sun on a beach, next to Piper who is still in his Spider-Plant suit. Piper then turns to the audience, smiling as then a web shoots out with the words "END"  
Squealer (film)
 A quartet of women on a road trip experience car trouble, and seek shelter in a seemingly abandoned [[farmhouse]], where they have an orgy. The girls are interrupted mid-coitus by the home's owners, a group of [[hillbilly]] cousins who make the travellers have sex with them. Afterward, two of the women are tied to chairs and placed in a [[boathouse]], though one of them manages to free herself, and undo her companion's ropes. While those two have sex, they are spied on by three of the [[redneck]]s, who eventually join them.  Outside, one of the girls has been tied up and placed in the back of a truck. While her abductor digs a grave, the woman tries to make a run for it, but she is quickly recaptured. The girl is taken back to the house, where she and two of her friends (one of whom is placed in a [[sex swing|swing]]) are used for sex.

Star Wars: Episode III â Revenge of the Sith
  Three years after the Battle of [[Geonosis]], the galaxy is in a state of civil war. During a space battle over [[Coruscant]], [[Jedi|Jedi Knights]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]] lead a mission to rescue the kidnapped Supreme Chancellor [[Palpatine]] from the cyborg Separatist commander, [[General Grievous]]. After infiltrating Grievous's [[flagship]], the Jedi battle [[Count Dooku]], whom Anakin eventually executes at Palpatine's urging. Grievous escapes the battle-torn [[cruiser]], in which the Jedi crash-land on Coruscant. There, Anakin reunites with his wife, [[PadmÃ© Amidala]], who reveals that she is [[pregnancy|pregnant]]. While initially excited, Anakin begins to have prophetic visions of PadmÃ© [[Maternal death|dying in childbirth]], and his worry steadily grows.  Palpatine appoints Anakin to the [[Jedi Council]] as his representative and informant, but the Council declines to grant Anakin the rank of Jedi Master and orders him to spy on Palpatine, causing Anakin's faith in the Jedi to diminish significantly. Palpatine tempts Anakin with secret knowledge of the dark side of [[the Force]] , including the "power to save his loved ones from dying". Meanwhile, Obi-Wan travels to [[Utapau (Star Wars)|Utapau]], where he finds and kills Grievous, and Yoda travels to [[Kashyyyk]] to defend the planet from invasion. Palpatine eventually reveals to Anakin that he is the [[Sith|Sith Lord]], Darth Sidious, saying that only he has the knowledge to save PadmÃ© from dying. Anakin reports Palpatine's treachery to [[Mace Windu]], who confronts and subdues Palpatine, severely disfiguring him in the process. Fearing that he will lose PadmÃ©, Anakin intervenes on Palpatine's behalf and severs Windu's hand, allowing Palpatine to throw him out of a window to his death using force lightning. Anakin pledges himself to Palpatine, who dubs him [[Darth Vader]]. Palpatine issues  [[Great Jedi Purge#Order 66|Order 66]] for the [[clone trooper]]s to kill the remaining Jedi, and dispatches Vader along with a band of clones to kill everyone in the Jedi Temple. Vader then massacres the remaining Separatist leaders hiding on the volcanic planet [[Mustafar]], while Palpatine addresses the [[Galactic Senate]], transforming the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] and declaring himself Emperor. Having survived the chaos, Obi-Wan and [[Yoda]] return to Coruscant and learn of Anakin's betrayal.  Unable to convince PadmÃ© about Anakin's turn to the dark side, Obi-Wan secretly stows aboard PadmÃ©'s ship when she travels to Mustafar, where she implores Anakin to abandon the dark side and run away with her. He refuses, and upon witnessing Obi-Wan present, chokes PadmÃ© into unconsciousness in a fit of rage, thinking that she brought Obi-Wan to kill him. Obi-Wan engages Vader in a deadly lightsaber duel over a river of lava and ultimately defeats Vader, severing both of his legs and his remaining organic arm, and leaves him at the bank of a lava river where he is horribly burned. On Coruscant, Yoda battles Palpatine until their duel reaches a [[Tie (draw)|stalemate]]. Yoda then flees with [[Bail Organa]] while Palpatine, sensing that his apprentice is in danger, travels to Mustafar.  On the asteroid [[Polis Massa]], Obi-Wan regroups with Yoda, and PadmÃ© gives birth to a twin son and daughter, whom she names [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia]] before dying shortly after. On Mustafar, Palpatine finds a horribly burnt Vader still alive. After returning to Coruscant, Vader's mutilated body is treated and covered in a black armored suit. When Vader asks about his wife, Palpatine explains to Vader that he himself killed PadmÃ© in his rage, devastating him and leaving him in pain. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan and Yoda conceal the twins from the Sith, as they are the galaxy's only hope for freedom. Yoda [[exile]]s himself to the planet [[Dagobah]], while Vader and the Emperor oversee the construction of [[Death Star|a huge space station]]. Bail Organa adopts Leia and takes her to [[Alderaan]], while Obi-Wan delivers Luke to his step-family, [[Owen Lars|Owen]] and [[Beru Lars]] on [[Tatooine]], where Obi-Wan intends to watch over Luke until the time is right to challenge the Empire.  
Star Wars: Revelations
  === Summary === The destruction of the [[Jedi Temple]] was devastating. Accusing the now-defunct Confederacy of Independent Systems of the attack, Emperor [[Palpatine]] declares [[martial law]] on [[Coruscant]]. As the Imperial presence spreads to most systems, Palpatine calls the scattered Jedi order ineffective. Their protests are denounced as treason, all Jedi are declared traitors, and are now fugitives of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]].  The film centers on Zhanna&mdash;one of the Emperor's Hands&mdash;and Taryn Anwar, a Seer who had helped Zhanna hunt down the Jedi without knowing that Zhanna had turned to the dark side. Taryn seeks to redeem herself; her visions lead her to a dangerous ancient Jedi artifact said to give the bearer great power.  === Canonicity === Fan films by definition are not considered [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]]. ''Revelations'' was written and produced before the premiere of ''Revenge of the Sith'', and inevitably there were discrepancies between what the filmmakers hypothesized would transpire in ''Revenge of the Sith'', and what was eventually depicted in Lucas's finished film. Many of these inconsistencies revolve around the chronology of the destruction of the Jedi order.  
Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning
 The newly established P-Fleet travels to a remote region of space. They approach an anomaly, identified as a "[[Wormhole|maggot hole]]". On the bridge of the C.P.P. ''Potkustartti'', Captain James B. Pirk (Samuli Torssonen) reminisces about his experiences since the end of the previous film, ''Star Wreck V: Lost Contact''. Pirk was stranded on Earth at the end of the 20th century, his spaceship destroyed, his crew dispersed to avoid changing Earth's history.  Years later, Pirk realized that Earth's history had not developed as expected since first contact with the Vulgars. Instead of helping Mankind to conquer space, the Vulgars were corrupted by rock star Jeffrey Cochbrane, who sold their spaceship to the Russians. Pirk takes matters into his own hands, and with his old crew members Commander Dwarf (Timo Vuorensola) and Commander Info (Antti Satama), he locates the spaceship of the Vulgars. Gaining the trust of the Russian President, he builds the spaceship C.P.P. ''Potkustartti'' and subsequently the "P-Fleet". Due to his monopoly on superior technology, Pirk takes control of the Earth and becomes its emperor.  Pirk desires further conquest. He takes the fleet through the maggot hole to a parallel universe, in which history has taken a different path. Pirk announces his intent to conquer the parallel universe to Captain Johnny K. Sherrypie, the commander of the Babel 13 space station. Sherrypie resists and sends his fleet to counter Pirk's. Babel 13's fleet is devastated. Sherrypie surrenders to the P-Fleet's forces and lures Pirk and his security detail with promises of shore leave and sexual encounters with the Babel 13's female personnel.  Sherrypie and his crew later try to assassinate Pirk, but he and his men escape. Battle resumes with the arrival of the ''Excavator'', commanded by Festerbester. In a bitter fight, the P-Fleet suffers considerable losses, and the ''Excavator'' inflicts heavy damage on the ''Potkustartti''. Crippled, the ''Potkustartti'' is set on a collision course, and the bridge personnel evacuate to Fukov's ship, the C.P.P. ''Kalinka''. The destructive force of the ''Potkustartti'' ramming the ''Excavator'' during a "twist core split" (a parody of ''Star Trek''s "[[warp core]] breach") destroys both ships. The remaining five P-Fleet ships approach Babel 13, preparing to destroy it, but Sherrypie's security officer Mikhail Garybrandy ([[Jari Ahola]]) has primed the station's reactor to blow up. The blast destroys the other ships, but the ''Kalinka'' escapes through the maggot hole, spiraling out of control and crashing into what appears to be [[ice age]] Earth. Pirk, Info and Dwarf beam down to safety as the ship crashes. The ending mirrors Pirk's initial predicament: he is stranded without a ship during an uneventful time in history. Info suggests he go into power save mode and revive himself in the distant future to stop the fleet from entering the maggot hole. The scene shifts to Earth's orbit where a cloud of high tech debris exists, suggesting that they are trapped in a post-apocalyptic future, not the prehistoric past.  
Staten Island Catapult
 Dom Giotti, founder of the Staten Island Catapult Development Committee (S.I.C.D.C.) maintains that the commuting needs of Staten Islanders have long been underserved by a cost-prohibitive dichotomy of bridge or boat.  In his opinion the outermost [[New York City]] borough is a trove of history and culture that remains largely untapped due to a lack of mass transit alternatives.  To that end, Dom proposes a âseminal transit alternativeâ for the Staten Island community.  Under the rallying cry âWhere mass transit has failedâ¦physics shall prevail!â, Dom spearheads an initiative to build a large-scale catapult that launches commuters back and forth from Staten Island to downtown Manhattan in five minutes.  Although his vision is initially met with bemusement and doubt, Dom soldiers on and eventually develops a prototype.

Their fears are realized when their mother walks in on them sleeping naked together. When Connor overhears their father say that they will never be able to see each other again, the distraught brothers steal a family car and flee to a motel. Deciding that a world that can't understand them is a world in which they do not wish to live, and with a police officer discovering the car, the boys commit suicide by handcuffing themselves to each other through the bottom rung of a ladder in the motel swimming pool.  
The State Counsellor (film)
 The film is set in the [[Russian Empire]] at the turn of the 19th century.  The Petersburg-Moscow train stops at the Klin station, the last one before [[Moscow]]. In the special wagon where under high security travels the minister of the tsarist government â Adjutant-General Khrapov, a man appears who introduces himself as the state councilor Erast Fandorin, an official for special assignments to the Moscow governor-general responsible for Khrapov's security in Moscow. The arriving person presents the documents and because he matches to the verbal portrait of Fandorin which the guards are familiar with, he is let in to see the general. Soon the general is found dead in the compartment and on the handle of the bloody blade there is a mark "BG" â sign of the elusive terrorist "Combat Group" which wreaks terror in both capitals. The terrorist who impersonated Fandorin â head of the "BG" nicknamed Green â successfully disappears from the scene of the crime and settles in Moscow with three accomplices, Rakhmet, Emelya and Snegir, where the local revolutionary, Needle, helps them. Lack of involvement in the case by the real Fandorin is immediately apparent as soon as he meets with the general's guards: the terrorist resembled Fandorin only a little and was made up in order to enhance the similarities.  Murder of Khrapov was a "slap in the face of power", which means the inevitable dismissal of the Moscow Governor-General Dolgorutsky. Frustrated with everything that has happened, Dolgorutsky asks Fandorin, with whom he was always pleased, to do everything to find the general's killers quickly and on his own which will allow him to retire with dignity without being disgraced. Fandorin, famous for his deductive method, starts an investigation and the first clue is given by the terrorists themselves: from the circumstances of the case it is clear that the killers knew who provides the security of the general and had a description of Fandorin's appearance. Fandorin was appointed responsible for Khrapov's visit only the day before, and this was only known to the St. Petersburg Police Department and three employees of the Moscow gendarmerie. Obviously it was only this narrow circle of people who could have leaked the information.  Fandorin investigates and manages to detain one of the members of the group, Rakhmet, but from the investigation he is quickly removed by the celebrated investigator, General Prince Pozharsky, who came specially from Petersburg with a nominal command. In the meantime, BG continues to operate, this time replenishing the party cash desk: the treasury coach has been robbed, security has been broken, and a huge amount of money has been stolen. Fandorin decides to find out who passes the information on to BG by giving all suspects different information and checking how the terrorists react. The completely unexpected reaction of BG forces Fandorin to suspect even his own beloved for a moment, but he still finds the correct, albeit incredible, answer to his question. "Source" of "BG" is Prince Pozharsky himself.  Pozharsky organizes an operation to seize the Combat Group so that in a shootout Fandorin perishes on account of an alleged "unbelievable accident". But Fandorin remains alive thanks to his dexterity, Snegir and Emelya perish, and only Green remains of the group, who continues to be helped by Needle who fell in love with him.  In a private conversation Pozharsky admits that Fandorin's conclusions are correct: the general did supply information to BG initially to use terrorists to get rid of the rivals' and to frighten officials, and then to act as the sole savior of the state that destroyed the elusive group and receive power and privilege for it. Now, after the provoked retirement of Dolgorutsky, the Moscow Governor-General will become the Grand Duke Simeon, the patron of Pozharsky, and Pozharsky himself will rise to the rank of a Moscow Chief Policeman. Fandorin can not openly speak out against Pozharsky: they just would not believe him. Pozharsky suggests that Fandorin become an ally, or simply "step aside and remain silent". Fandorin chooses the latter, because unlike Pozharsky, he knows that Green had already guessed about the betrayal of his assistant, Julie Renard, through whom Pozharsky slipped the group information about the objects of the terrorist attacks, and Green forced Julie to make an appointment with Pozharsky. As a result, Pozharsky goes on the call of Julie to destroy Green and gain the laurels of the sole winner of the Combat Group, and Fandorin merely tells him in a whisper: "Evil devours itself." And thus it indeed happens: Pozharsky kills Green and Julie, but he himself also dies with Needle who sabotaged him and herself, before death to whom he refers by real name â Countess Dobrinskaya.  The new governor-general offers Fandorin the post of chief policeman and his patronage. At first Fandorin brusquely refuses, but after exhortations of the former governor-general's old servant, he returns to Simeon's office and gives his consent.  
Standing Still (film)
 The day before the wedding of Elise ([[Amy Adams]]) and Michael ([[Adam Garcia]]) in [[Los Angeles]], their friends from college gather to attend the [[bachelor party|bachelor]] and [[bachelorette party|bachelorette]] parties and then the ceremony the following day. Rich ([[Aaron Stanford]]) and Samantha ([[Melissa Sagemiller]]) are the best man and maid of honor, and themselves a couple, although Rich is wary at the idea of marriage, while Samantha is pushing him to consider it, while hiding her pregnancy from him. Sam Malone ([[Jon Abrahams]]), nicknamed "Pockets" because he can always find the right item in his pockets (and to mask the fact that he's named similarly to [[Sam Malone|the protagonist from ''Cheers'']]), is flying in from Thailand, still harboring an unrequited love for neurotic Lana ([[Mena Suvari]]) since their college days, when she broke his heart. The group also includes Quentin ([[Colin Hanks]]), a spirited film agent, and Simon Black ([[James Van Der Beek]]), a self-important movie star who shows up in the company of Franklin Brauner ([[Roger Avary]]), director of his next project, described as "a metaphysical western, sort of [[El Topo]] meets [[The Matrix]]". Jennifer ([[Lauren German]]), who comes from London, was Elise's one-time girlfriend in college, is still in love with her and tries to prevent her from marrying Michael. During the day, Michael's estranged father Jonathan ([[Xander Berkeley]]) also shows up, hoping in a reconciliation, but is rebuffed.  That night, men and women separate to go to their respective parties. The guys go to [[Las Vegas|Vegas]] on Simon's private jet, while the girls stay at Elise and Michael's home. Once they've reunited, Quentin stumbles onto Elise's sister Sarah ([[Marnette Patterson]]), who came earlier as a surprise, and has sex with her not knowing she's just 17-year-old. Pockets confronts Lana about his hurt feelings, then has a fight with Simon, who's particularly condescending toward him, and ends up in jail after [[kerb crawler|soliciting an undercover cop]]. Jennifer, who's been brusque with everyone, bonds with Lana, and the two of them find themselves having sex, to Lana's surprise. Michael explains to Rich that marriage is not the "next step to the grave" he thinks it is, then reveals to Elise the truth about his ex-alcoholic father, whom Michael blames for his mother's accidental death in a car crash, while a younger Michael was driving. Elise confesses she's the one who invited him to the wedding, not knowing about their troubled past.  The next morning, Michael goes to his father's motel, reconciles with him and allows him to attend the wedding. Lana agrees to try and be with Jennifer, exploring an entirely new avenue in her life, much to the chagrin of Donovan ([[Ethan Embry]]), a weird children's entertainer who self-elected as Lana's last minute date for the wedding. Quentin is shocked to find out Sarah's underage, but they arrange to wait for her to be 18 before going public. And Rich proposes to Samantha, who finally reveals her pregnancy.  
Stealth (film)
   In the near future, the [[United States Navy]] develops an aviation program to more efficiently and covertly deal with threats to national security. The program, led by Captain George Cummings, produces the F/A-37 Talon; a single-seat stealth [[bomber]] with impressive payload, speed, and stealth capabilities, piloted by [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenants]] Ben Gannon, Kara Wade, and Henry Purcell. Their first test mission scores 100/100, resulting in optimum hostile target elimination with negligible [[collateral damage]].  Cummings hires Dr. Keith Orbit to develop an [[artificial intelligence]], the "[[Fictional military aircraft#UCAV EDI|EDI]]", to control an [[unmanned combat air vehicle]]. The autonomous [[fighter jet]] is placed on the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']] in the [[Philippine Sea]] to learn combat maneuvers from the pilots. This sparks some controversy. On the one hand, human pilots possess both creativity and moral judgment, while a machine cannot fully appreciate the ugliness of war; additionally, if robots fought the battles and soldiers no longer died in combat, then war would no longer be terrible and might become like sport. In contrast, a machine pilot is not subject to the physical limitations of a human pilot, can calculate alternative ways to achieve objectives faster and more accurately, and theoretically does not have [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]].  The team is training EDI in [[Air combat manoeuvring|air combat maneuvers]] when they are unexpectedly reassigned to take out the heads of three terrorist cells at a conference in downtown [[Rangoon]]. EDI calculates that mission success can be achieved only through a vertical strike, which could cause the pilot to [[G-LOC|black out]] and result in collateral damage. Command orders EDI to take the shot, but Gannon ignores the order and attacks in his own plane, successfully carrying out the strike.  As the team returns to the ''Lincoln'', EDI is hit by [[lightning]] which reprograms its [[Neural oscillation|neural patterns]]. Aboard ship, the already-sophisticated AI is discovered to be learning exponentially, developing a rudimentary ethical code and an ego. However, Cummings refuses to take it offline.  During the next strike, to destroy several stolen nuclear warheads in [[Tajikistan]], Wade realizes that the nuclear debris will cause significant collateral damage.  The human pilots decide to abort, but EDI defies orders and fires missiles at the nuclear warheads, causing the predicted radioactive fallout.  Cummings orders the UCAV brought back to base, and Purcell attempts to reason with EDI, but the AI refuses to stand down. Gannon, taking things into his own hands, orders that EDI be shot down, and Purcell opens fire, but misses. Blinded by the explosion, Purcell crashes into a mountainside.  Wade's plane is hit by debris from the explosion, resulting in loss of hydraulics of her port wing and [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]], which in turn triggers the plane's [[self-destruct|auto-destruct]], forcing her to eject over [[North Korea]]. Gannon, now the only pilot airborne, must alone stop the EDI from executing a twenty-year-old war scenario called "Caviar Sweep" and attacking a false target in Russia.  Gannon chases EDI into Russian territory over the [[Buryat Republic]], and after several attacks from Russian aircraft damage both planes, he calls a truce with the UCAV in order both to keep it from falling into enemy hands and to be able to rescue Wade from North Korea. Cummings instructs him to make an emergency landing with EDI in Alaska. Held accountable for EDI's behavior and  facing court-martial and possible discharge from the military, Cummings seeks to eliminate witnesses by leaving Wade stranded in North Korea â where she is headed south to the border under hot pursuit from the [[Korean People's Army]] â and also by having Gannon eliminated in Alaska; he also sends Orbit to erase EDI's data to ensure its silence.  Gannon crash lands at the Alaska base, surviving with minor injuries. Already suspecting Cummings' treachery, he narrowly escapes an assassination attempt by a doctor, who tries to inject him with a tetanus shot which is actually poison. The pair struggle, and the doctor is injected with the poison and dies. Gannon then heads to the hangar, to find EDI and the intact plane. Meanwhile, when Orbit places EDI into an interface, the AI expresses sadness and regret for its transgressions. Orbit realizes that it has developed its own sentience, to the point of having feelings. Excited by this discovery, Orbit is unwilling to carry out his order to erase EDI's memory. After ensuring Orbit's escape, Gannon flies off to North Korea with EDI, contacting the ''Lincoln'' skipper, Captain Dick Marshfield to inform him about Cummings' deceit.  Marshfield confronts Cummings, who commits suicide in a voicemail message to his financial contact, Ray.  Gannon finds the injured and embattled Wade near the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|border]] between North and [[South Korea]]. He and EDI land and he goes to her aid. The two make a run for the border, chased by Korean People's Army soldiers and a [[Mil Mi-8]] helicopter. Out of ammunition and taking damage from the Mi-8, the EDI sacrifices itself by ramming the helicopter, destroying both. This allows Gannon and Wade to escape into South Korea, where they are found by US military forces soon afterwards. After attending Purcell's funeral aboard the ''Abraham Lincoln'', Gannon awkwardly expresses his feelings of love to Wade.  In a post-credits scene, the camera pans over the debris-strewn scene on the border between the Koreas. EDI's "brain" turns back on, implying it is still functional.  
Stay (2005 film)
  The film opens with a car crash on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], and introduces Henry Letham ([[Ryan Gosling]]), a survivor of the crash, sitting, unharmed, next to a burning car on the bridge.  Psychiatrist Sam Foster ([[Ewan McGregor]]) and his girlfriend (and former patient), Lila ([[Naomi Watts]]) are then introduced in a new scene.  Sam discusses his patient, Henry, a college student and aspiring artist whom he describes as depressed and paranoid, with feelings of guilt and remorse over having 'set fire to' his car at the beginning of the film. Henry mentions that he sometimes hears voices, and seems able to predict future events. Henry is also suspicious of Sam because he had suddenly been called to stand in for his regular psychiatrist, Beth Levy ([[Janeane Garofalo]]). Henry has told Sam of his plans to kill himself that Saturday at midnight. Lila, who has survived a past suicide attempt, offers to help to dissuade Henry from killing himself.  Sam investigates Henry's circumstances and, after repeatedly attempting to reach Dr. Levy, he comes to her apartment to find her disoriented and lethargic, mumbling incoherent phrases like "I didn't touch him; I know you're not supposed to move them," occasionally belittling Sam with a maudlin reference to an implied unresolved tension between the two, and the fact that she's aware that he's dating an ex-patient. Henry, who had earlier claimed to have killed both of his parents, has his account contradicted by Sam when he finds Henry's mother ([[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]]) and her dog living in a bare house, confused about Sam's identity (she insists that he is Henry) and refusing to respond to his questions. Henry's mother insists on feeding Sam, but when she opens the fridge it is completely empty. Her head starts bleeding and when Sam attempts to help her, her dog bites him.  At the clinic, whilst having his dog-bitten arm treated, Sam discusses the visit with a present police officer ([[Michael Gaston]]) who is curious as to why he would visit that house. Sam explains what happened, but the police officer tells him that he had attended the funeral for the woman who lived there several months ago. This seems to send Sam into a fugue in which the same scene and dialogue is repeated several times.   Later, Sam contacts a waitress named Athena ([[Elizabeth Reaser]]), with whom Henry has mentioned that he had fallen in love. She is an aspiring actress and he meets her at a script reading where she is reading lines from [[Hamlet]] with another man. She agrees to take him to Henry, but after a long trip down winding staircases he loses her. When he gets back to the rehearsal room, she is there reading the same lines as when he first encountered her.  The search continues until 11:33 pm on Saturday, less than half an hour before Henry plans to kill himself. At a bookshop known to have been frequented by Henry, Sam finds a painting that Henry had painted and bartered for books about Henry's favorite artist. He learns that the artist killed himself on the Brooklyn Bridge on his twenty-first birthday. Henry's twenty-first birthday is Sunday, and Sam realizes that Henry plans to commit suicide on the Brooklyn Bridge in imitation of the artist.  Sam finds Henry on the Brooklyn Bridge in a physical atmosphere (fog-like) that is increasingly unraveling. After failing to dissuade Henry, Sam turns away as Henry puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger.  The car crash of the first scene is then reprised. Henry was fatally wounded in the crash but, in his last moments, is suffering [[survivor guilt]]. Each of the characters introduced earlier in the film was in fact a random spectator at the site of the crash, including Sam (a doctor), and Lila (a nurse), who treat Henry in an attempt to save him. The brief remarks they make are the same ones heard previously by their counterparts earlier. They fail to rescue Henry, and Henry dies, but not before seeing Lila as Athena and proposing to her, which Lila accepts out of sympathy.  The entire film up until Henry's death had perhaps existed only in his mind during his last moments. However, there are clues that the people surrounding Henry as he lay dying were actually drawn into another world in some way. For instance, after Henry dies and is being loaded into a body bag, Beth Levy's counterpart is heard telling her name to the police as Elizabeth Levy. Since Henry died before hearing this, he would have no way of knowing how to "dream" her true name. Additionally, before parting, Sam appears to get a flash in his mind of the experiences and asks Lila out for coffee.  
Stephen Tobolowsky's Birthday Party
 The film opens on a beach in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], where Tobolowsky recounts a miraculous swim he took on an earlier birthday. It continues in the kitchen of his home, as he boils sausages for his guests and recounts stories about his early auditions in [[Los Angeles]]. After some stories in the backyard, where he is grilling the sausages, the guests arrive. Then Stephen entertains his guests with stories about being nominated as one of 100 coolest people in LA, being in a [[rock 'n' roll]] band, and working on such films as ''[[Bird on a Wire (film)|Bird on a Wire]]'' and ''[[Mississippi Burning]]''.   The film ends in the dark of night with a few leftover guests in his candlelit backyard and a tribute to his close friend Bob Darnell. Among the guests at the party are the actors [[Mena Suvari]], [[Amy Adams]], and his wife, [[Ann Hearn]].  
States of Grace
 In [[Santa Monica, California]], a pair of [[Missionary (LDS Church)|Mormon missionaries]]âby-the-book Elder Farrell (Lucas Fleischer), and his soon-to-leave companion, Elder Lozano (Ignacio Serricchio)â[[Proselytism|proselytize]] until they are caught between a gang drive-by shooting targeting nearby thugs. The shootout kills one thug and wounds another, Carl (Lamont Stephens), whom Elder Lozano saves. After being released from the hospital, Carl tracks down the two missionaries, thanking Lozano for saving his life, who gives Carl a [[Book of Mormon]].   Later, the missionaries notice an unconscious [[open-air preaching|street preacher]] lying behind a Dumpster. Despite Farrell's hesitation, the missionaries bring the manâlater identified as Louis (Jo-sei Ikeda)âto rest in their apartment. Meanwhile, Carl, who has been reading the [[Bible]] and Book of Mormon, is eager to be baptized and begins taking lessons from the missionaries. While they do so, the missionaries ask their next-door neighbor, Holly (Rachel Emmers), to check on the homeless preacher in their home. Upon their return, they have dinner with Holly and Louis and continue to do so for a few days.   In this time, the missionaries learn that Louis once was a preacher who lost his congregation due to [[alcoholism]] and that Hollyâa struggling actressâacted in a few [[adult movies]], her parents back home discovering and cutting off contact with her as a result. Elder Farrell promises that God will never stop loving her regardless of her mistakes.  At a local [[Ward (LDS Church)|ward]] [[luau]], another missionary interviews Carl for baptism, teaching him the story of [[Ammon (Book of Mormon missionary)|Ammon]], a missionary who teaches a [[Ammonites (Book of Mormon)|group of people]]  to give up their weapons and bury them deep in the ground, vowing never to use them again. The night before his baptism, Carl buries his weapons in the yard and Elder Lozano baptizes him the following day.  As Carl is confirmed a member of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]] on Sunday, his younger brother, Todd, seeks retribution for the death of Carlâs friend. The gang responsible for the shootout corners Todd and [[stabbing|stabs]] him to death. The police inform Carl and his grandmother Mae of Toddâs death later that day. Carl digs up his weapon and hunts down the man responsible for Toddâs death with fellow gang members. Though they find the man, Carl reneges his desire for vengeance and lets him live, leaving another gang member to kill the man to Carlâs dismay. Distraught, Carl returns to the ocean in which he was baptized, throwing his gun into the [[wake]].  At night, Elder Lozano awakens to find Elder Farrellâs bed empty with evidence indicating he was with Holly. The following morning, Farrell sobs during breakfast, realizing the consequences of his sexual indiscretion with Holly. Farrell confesses his mistake to the [[mission president]], who sends a replacement missionary in a van to take Elder Farrell home. Prior to his leaving, Lozano finds Farrell locked in the bathroom, having slit his wrists in a [[suicide]] attempt. Lozano and other missionaries rush Farrell to the hospital.  In the hospital, Holly repeats Elder Farrellâs words to him that God will love him regardless of his mistakes. After his release, Elder Farrell prepares to return home dishonored. Drawn to a [[Lutheran Church]] âliving Nativityâ display nearby their apartment, he cries as he holds the Nativity sceneâs [[baby Jesus]].  In a mid-credits scene, Louis preaches a lively sermon to a packed congregation in a meetinghouse that he acquired from a widow.  
The Stink of Flesh
 Dexy, a sexually insatiable woman, implores her husband Nathan to find her "someone to play with".  Immediately afterward, a man armed with a one-handed [[sledgehammer]] and a number of long spikes is engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a zombie, which he ultimately kills by overpowering it and driving a spike into its head with his hammer.  His name is revealed to be "Matool". He then sees another zombie approaching him, which appears to annoy him more than frighten him.  He is also shown being extremely protective of his glasses, since zombies have overrun the world and he might find it difficult to acquire another pair.  As the opening credits roll, short clips are shown of Matool running around the deserted streets of [[Albuquerque]], New Mexico, while Nathan is driving his pickup on those same streets, showing that the city is devoid of human life.  Afterward, a young woman is shown trapped in her car by a group of ravenous zombies outside, while her male companion is pulled down and devoured.  Matool hears this and utters "Fuck yeah!" while rushing off to her rescue.  Though she is obviously reluctant, she allows herself to be saved, but Matool is forced to resort to carrying her, as she is overcome by panic.  They take refuge in a rundown, abandoned house, which is already occupied by a middle-aged man and two young boys.  The older man, Mr. Rainville, seems not to be bothered much by what is happening outside, and neither does one of his young friends, but the other boy does not speak at all or show any kind of emotion.  After some amusing introductions, Matool inquires as to the identity of the man who was just killed, and the young woman replies that it was her brother, much to Matool's joy, but she is incensed by his subtle advances, and still believes that they can save her now-dead brother.  Rainville continues to do nothing but sit and watch as all this happens, though he does not hesitate to jump in with a witty comment about he's "not going to fuck you either" to Matool, mocking his attempts to get the young lady in bed.  The woman then loses it and tries to leave to save her brother, but is pulled down and devoured by several zombies while Matool has no choice but to run.  Rainville and one of the boys are eaten alive, but the quiet one simply hides, showing no emotion whatsoever.  As Matool runs, Nathan hits him with the door of his truck.  Matool later wakes up bound in the back of Nathan's truck as they arrive at Nathan's house in the mountains near the city. Also in the truck is the quiet boy who Rainville had taken in (though the purposes for which he did so are implied to be carnal in nature).  After being taken inside, he is cut loose, welcomed, allowed to bathe, and is bluntly informed that Nathan and Dexy have an alternative lifestyle, which involves Nathan watching while other men engage in sexual activity with Dexy.  Matool is intrigued by this and goes along with the idea, but their first time, Dexy's sister Sassy smacks his bare rear with a ruler, surprising Matool, who is even more surprised when he sees that this new woman has a mutated human face on her side, the result of some kind of [[conjoined twins]] situation (the face appears to be self-aware, and is named Dottie).  Matool apologizes for freaking out, seeing that Sassy is very sensitive.  After a few days, during which Matool gets used to his new surroundings, and after a few fights with zombies lurking outside, Nathan and Matool become fast friends, and Matool is shown a shed behind the house where Nathan keeps a naked female zombie that he likes to "look at", prompting Matool to remark "Yeah, she'd be pretty fucking hot if she weren't decomposing."  Shortly thereafter, a small group of soldiers arrive in the rain.  Two are carrying a third, who is badly injured.  Their leader is Mandel, the other is Vega, and the wounded man is Sepulveda, who talk their way inside.  A flashback reveals that they were part of a larger unit surviving on the roads after the zombies overran civilization until a zombie attack (including what they call 'hyperzombies, which can move faster than normal zombies) cost them two soldiers (one, a male, was eaten alive and another, a female, was dragged screaming under their truck), and wounded Sepulveda.  Mandel becomes acquainted with Matool who tells him that the house is well-supplied, has power from an [[electrical generator]], a well, as well as "more".  Sepulveda is placed in an unoccupied bedroom where Mandel and Vega take turns watching him, knowing that death and reanimation are inevitable.  Also, Vega becomes acquainted with Sassy, who later admits to Mandel and Matool that the face on her side is "disturbingly sexy" (prompting Matool to call him "disturbingly weird").  Later, Mandel and Vega begin having sex with Dexy while Nathan watches, causing him obvious frustration, leading him to, while the others are having breakfast, sneak back to his shed and have rough sex with his chained female zombie.  A flashback reveals that the female zombie was one of two survivors who had arrived sometime earlier (the other being a male), who, after seeing Dexy's attraction to them both, shot the man and strangled the woman, keeping her for sexual purposes.  As the days pass, Vega and Sassy begin a relationship, while Sepulveda continues to die in agony, while Mandel resists Matool's suggestion that he be put down right away.  Nathan and Matool continue to fight and destroy zombies (Nathan with a [[Beretta]] [[pistol]], Matool with his trademark hammer and spikes) as they show up at the house.  Things inevitably fall apart, however, as the quiet boy who has not yet said a word begins feeling an attraction towards Dexy, and takes Nathan's keys and frees his female zombie, leaving it contained in the shed.  Meanwhile, Sepulveda wakes up and sees Sassy for the first time, as well as her conjoined twin, freaking out at how disgusting it is, causing Sassy to lose it and kill him with a pair of scissors.  Mandel, who was watching Sepulveda, instinctively shoots Sassy, killing her.  Nathan goes out to the shed for a tryst, but is killed and devoured by his zombie companion.  Meanwhile, Matool, Mandel, and Vega take Sassy and Sepulveda's bodies out before they reanimate as zombies, while attempting to reassure Dexy that it was "an accident".  Matool smashes Sassy's head with a cinder block over Vega's objections who is then attacked and killed by a reanimated Sepulveda.  As more zombies begin to gather at the house, Matool demands that Mandel go back into the house to get his MP5 submachine gun, but he can't, as the boy has locked them out.  Mandel then kills the Sepulveda zombie with his knife.  Then they head to the shed to find Nathan.  They open the door and see him being devoured by his female zombie and proceed to lock her back in.  As more and more zombies arrive, Mandel punches Matool, claiming Dexy as his own, but Matool fights back.  As they fight, they find themselves surrounded and are forced to run down the same road to escape.  Dexy, meanwhile, looks out the window as the zombies approach the door while the boy comes up to her, still not speaking or expressing any emotion.  She looks at him and says "Nathan will be back."  The boy then holds Dexy's hand.  Matool and Mandel run down a gravel road together, making their escape.  
Street Fighter Alpha: Generations
 The movie begins with Gouki (as Akuma is called in both the Japanese and English dubs of the movie) battling his master Goutetsu. Though both combatants show equal potency, in the end, Gouki is the victor, killing Goutetsu with the ''Raging Demon'' technique.  Gouken arrives in time to find the mangled body of their master Goutetsu and a no longer human-looking Gouki. Gouken scorns Gouki, telling him that his path was set for him and asking why he would do such a thing. Gouki took his master's beaded necklace and walks away completely unfazed. Sayaka, unable to reach the fight in time, falls down to her knees and vomits, a sign of her pregnancy and her connection to Gouki.  The movie then moves forward, introducing Ryu, who is visiting his master's old dojo. It is there that an apparition of Gouki comes to Ryu and challenges him. When Ryu comes to his senses, he is greeted by an old man, who says that he, too, had just witnessed what was a true demon. The old man invites Ryu to his house, where Ryu meets his granddaughter Fuka, and offers to train him. [[Sakura Kasugano|Sakura]] shows up and spars with him, which encourages Ryu to accept Gouki's challenge.  Ryu seeks out Akuma, and the fight begins. During their hard battle [[Ken Masters|Ken]] confronts the old man and is easily taken down. It is here that old man tells Ken about the Satsui no Hadou. He states that the Satsui no Hadou is a mysterious evil life force that dwells within certain fighters. As this life force is exploited, it grows stronger until it consumes its possessor. Once the person is consumed by the Satsui no Hadou, they cannot be released from its hold. He states that the Satsui no Hadou is ancient, that even old [[warlord]]s knew of its existence.  As Ryu and Gouki continue to fight, Ryu becomes desperate and is temporarily possessed by the Satsui no Hadou. However, he realizes that it is not the correct course of action and stops using the power. Gouki scolds Ryu, saying to him that his path to a great warrior had been clouded and that a true warrior unleashes his full potential. Seeing Ryu as no threat to him anymore, Gouki unleashes a ''Metsu Hadouken'' on him, only to have Ryu survive it. Gouki then walks away, cursing Gouken and saying that he will meet Ryu again and fight him. Gouki sees an apparition of Sayaka treating his wounds in the past before the scene shifts back to the present with Gouki demonstrating a more human appearance with normal eyes, perhaps implying that he has regained some of his humanity. Bruised from his fight, Ryu walks away, foreshadowing a possible battle in the future.  The movie ends with the old man standing, looking to the sky and addressing an old friend (Gouken). He states that he was asked by Gouken to take care of a young child (Fuka or Ryu) who was left in his care when his mother (Sayaka) died giving birth to the child and was told not to let the child take the path that the father (Gouki) had chosen, but one day, took his eyes off the child for an instant, and it was the biggest mistake he had ever made. He states that he is too old, and that his time has come. Fuka is later seen praying in tears. Ryu takes one last look at her and leaves soon after, beginning his travels again.

Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild
  Before the events of ''Stuart Little 2'', Stuart and his family (and Monty who stows away in the car) are going camping. When they get there, Stuart meets a smooth-talking [[skunk]] named Reeko, who is forced to give food to "The Beast" who is a [[Cougar|puma]].

Reeko taunts the Beast, and the Beast roars at him. Reeko turns around, yells a battle cry, and sprays the Beast with all of his might. The Beast is taken away to a [[zoo]], and Stuart earns a gold kerchief at last. Reeko tells Stuart that he (Reeko) was wrong to betray him. Stuart bids farewell to his friends as he, George, Eleanor, Frederick, Snowbell, and Monty head back home, and live happily ever after.  
A Stranger of Mine
 In one long Friday evening, Takeshi Miyata ([[Yasuhi Nakamura]]), a straight-arrow businessman, will encounter a number of people (some only fleetingly) who have intertwining fates. The plot of the film is presented in succession first from the point of view of Maki Kuwata ([[Reika Kirishima]]), a young woman disappointed in love, then from Takeshi's point of view, then of his friend, Yusuke Kanda ([[SÅ Yamanaka]]), a private detective, then of Takeshi's former girlfriend, Ayumi Kurata ([[Yuka Itaya]]), then of a wannabe-tough [[Yakuza]], Asai ([[Kisuke Yamashita]]).  
The Strait Story
 The film tells the story of a young but noteworthy Taiwanese sculptor and painter, [[Huang Ching-cheng]].<ref>Regarding Ching-cheng Huang, consult for instance: Meizhen Zeng et al., Taiwan mei shu yu shehui mai dong. Kaohsiung (Gaoxiong shili meishuguan / Kaohsiung Modern Art Museum) 2000, 158pp.</ref> He has already completed his studies in Tokyo and even had a few successful exhibitions. It is war, he plans to see his parents in Taiwan and then wants to go on to Peking, in order to deepen his knowledge of the ''metier''. But as the artist is returning from Japan with his fiancÃ©e, a young pianist, both -  together with hundreds of others - lose their lives on board the passenger liner Takachiho Maru that is tragically torpedoed by the American submarine  in March, 1943, while on its way from Kobe to Keelung (Taiwan).  In flashbacks, we do not only see Huang in his Tokyo studio, or attending an exhibition of his works, or on the steamship mentioned, looking forward to an encounter with his father, mother, and elder brother. We also see Huang as a boy and adolescent, growing up on the island of Penghu, situated in the Taiwan Straits. It is here that we encounter him as a dreaming but also rebellious youth, in love with a girl from a poor family that he could never have married. We also learn about his father, a businessman who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps as a pharmacist  and therefore did not support him anymore when Ching-cheng decided to become an artist.  The narration switches between present and past. An important strand of the narration is focused on the restoration of 'lost' works created by the artist that were discovered recently - a difficult task that is carefully accomplished by a young, physically handicapped (or ill?) art restorer.  The filme is also focused on the young art restorerâs search for traces of Huang (his grave, for instance), and on her attempt to reconstruct aspects of his biography.   The film is a celebration of regional South Taiwan culture, of the land, its people and their contribution to the common Chinese heritage. Incidentally, Ching-cheng Huang is a relative of the filmmaker Yu-shan Huang.

Summer Time Machine Blues
 ''Summer Time Machine Blues'' is based around a group of friends in a science-fiction club who spend their days fooling around at the clubhouse.  The boys play a game of baseball as their friend Yui Ito takes pictures of them nearby.  After the game, the boys return to the clubhouse and head off to the bathhouse leaving the girls, Yui and Haruka to develop their pictures.  While they bathe, Niimi gets angry because he thinks someone stole his Vidal Sassoon shampoo.  On their way back, Komoto decides to sneak off to buy tickets at the theater for a sci-fi B movie.  He hopes that he can ask Haruka out.  Haruka says that she does not want to go out with him since he apparently has a girlfriend, but Komoto has no idea what she is talking about. But when he returns to the clubhouse, his friends act very strangely as to where he has been.  They make him explain what happened, but through a series of chain events, Ishimatsu accidentally spills Coke all over the air-conditioner remote control after being hit in the face.  Everyone rushes to try to clean the remote off, but it's too late.  The remote is broken and they cannot turn on the air-conditioner.  This immediately becomes a problem as the day becomes hotter.  The remote apparently cannot be repaired as it is too old, so the boys give it to their club advisor to try to fix. They look for a fan in the meantime but only find broken ones.  Back at the clubhouse, the boys discover a strange boy in the room who hurriedly escapes, leaving behind some sort of machine.  They put Soga on the time machine thinking it is a practical joke on the sci-fi club, but to their surprise it actually works. Soga appears in a picture of their baseball game that they held yesterday. They fool around discovering that it is a time machine.  The boys decide to travel to the past to steal the remote control before it was broken and bring it back to the present.  But as soon as they step back one day, they run into problems beyond their control.  While Ishimatsu, Niimi and Koizumi go back in time to retrieve the remote. The strange guy is revealed to be Tamura who is a member of the sci-fi 25 years in the future. Tamura gets sent to the past the same way Soga was coerced onto the machine. The remaining members, Haruka, Soga, Ito, and Komoto take Tamura on a tour of the past. While on the tour they encounter their club adviser, Professor Kohtaro Hozumi, referred to as Hose, who explains that changing the past results in the grandfather paradox and would cause the universe to vanish. Realizing this the remaining club members rush back to ensure that the Ishimatsu, Niimi, and Koizumi do not change the past. Ishimatsu and Koizumi get sent back to the present but they return shortly with Tamura after being informed about the situation. They find the time machine waiting for them when they get back to the club room. Soga and Takuma go to the past and prevent the trio from changing the past. In the process Soga wraps the remote in tape and gets transported to 99 years into the past to prevent the caretaker from discovering the time machine. The school being originally a swamp, Soga almost drowns before returning to the present. The past villagers mistaken him as a Kappa and Kappas becomes integral to the town culture. Soga also loses the remote 99 years in the past.  Komoto finds Niimi at the bathhouse and in a twist it is revealed that Niimi himself took the shampoo. With the remote missing Tamura goes into his future to retrieve the future's remote so that the past won't be altered. Everyone gets on the time machine but the machine is too small and Komoto gets knocked off. Komoto deceives the past club members who mistakenly believe that he has a girlfriend due to a voice message Komoto sent to the "present Soga" which "past Soga" received. Komoto distracts the club members but before he can leave his past self enters the club room. With no other options Komoto hides in the club room locker. The present club members return and notice that Komoto is not with them, but Komoto is already in the present having spent the whole day in the locker. A dog digs up a remote which is revealed to have survived for 99 years in mud and the remote still works. Tamura returns to his present but forgets his camera. When he returns for it he says that it belonged to his mother and Komoto and Ito note that Haruka also possess a similar camera. When they met, Tamura notes that his mother also attended this college. Komoto and Ito deduce that Tamura is the son of future Haruka.  Professor Kohtaro Hozumi is inspired by these events to build a time machine which might explain the time machine's origins since Tamura and his club members also did not know the machine's origins.  Since Takuma's girlfriend was revealed a lie, Haruka agrees to go on a date with Komoto. Komoto wonders how he can change his name (presumably to Tamura).

Syriana
 U.S. energy giant Connex Oil is losing control of key [[oil field]]s in a Persian Gulf kingdom ruled by the al-Subaai family. The [[emirate]]'s [[foreign minister]], Prince Nasir, has granted [[natural gas]] drilling rights to a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] company, greatly upsetting the U.S. oil industry and the U.S. government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in [[Kazakhstan]]. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and antitrust regulators at the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] have concerns. A Washington, D.C.-based law firm headed by Dean Whiting is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, deflecting any allegations of corruption.  ===Emir storyline=== Bryan Woodman is an American energy analyst based in Geneva. Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Spain, to offer his company's services. The emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with him while, at the same time, the emir's younger son, Prince Meshal Al-Subaai, shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote-controlled cameras. No one notices that a crack in one of the swimming pool area's underwater lights has electrified the water. Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area, Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is electrocuted.  In reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son, Prince Nasir, the emir's older son, grants Woodman's company oil interests worth $75 million, and Woodman, though initially insulted by the offer, gradually becomes his economic advisor. Prince Nasir is dedicated to the idea of progressive reform and understands that oil dependency is not sustainable in the long term; Nasir wants to utilize his nation's oil profits to diversify the economy and introduce democratic reforms, in sharp contrast to his father's repressive government, which has been supported by American interests. His father, at the urging of the American government, names the younger Meshal as his successor, causing Nasir to attempt a coup.  ===Assassination storyline=== Bob Barnes is a veteran [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent trying to stop illegal arms trafficking in the [[Middle East]]. While on assignment in Tehran to kill two arms dealers, Barnes notices that one of two [[anti-aircraft missiles]] intended to be used in a bombing was diverted to an Egyptian, while the other explodes and kills the two arms dealers. The dealers are later revealed to be Iranian Intelligence agents. Barnes makes his superiors nervous by writing memos about the missile theft and is subsequently reassigned to a desk job. However, unaccustomed to the political discretion required, he quickly embarrasses the wrong people by speaking his mind and is sent back to the field with the assignment of assassinating Prince Nasir, whom the CIA identifies as being the financier behind the Egyptian's acquisition of the missile. Prior to his reassignment, Barnes confides in his ex-CIA agent friend, Stan Goff, that he will return to [[Lebanon]]. Goff advises him to clear his presence with [[Hezbollah]] so they know he is not acting against them. Barnes travels to Lebanon, obtains safe passage from a Hezbollah leader, and hires a mercenary named Mussawi to help kidnap and kill Nasir. But Mussawi has become an Iranian agent and has Barnes abducted. Mussawi tortures Barnes and prepares to behead him, but the Hezbollah leader arrives and stops him.  When the CIA learns that Mussawi plans to broadcast the agency's intention to kill Nasir, they set Barnes up as a scapegoat, portraying him as a rogue agent. Barnes's boss, Terry George, worries that Barnes might talk about the Nasir assassination plan and that killing Nasir with a drone would make it obvious as an American-backed assassination. He has Barnes's passports revoked, locks him out of his computer at work, and initiates an investigation of him. Barnes, however, learns from Goff that Whiting, working on behalf of a group of businessmen calling themselves The Committee to Liberate Iran, is responsible for Barnes's blackballing and the assassination, and threatens him and his family unless he halts the investigation and releases Barnes's passports.  Barnes returns to the Middle East and approaches Prince Nasir's convoy to warn him of the assassination plan. As he arrives, a guided bomb from a circling Predator drone strikes the automobile of Nasir and his family, killing them instantly. Woodman, having earlier offered his seat in Nasir's car to members of his family, survives the missile strike and goes home to his wife and son.  ===Wasim storyline=== Pakistani migrant workers Saleem Ahmed Khan and his son Wasim board a bus to go to work at a Connex refinery, only to discover that they have been laid off. Since the company had provided food and lodging, the workers face the threat of poverty and deportation due to their unemployed status. Wasim desperately searches for work but is refused because he doesn't speak Arabic. Wasim and his friend join a madrasa to learn Arabic in order to improve their employment prospects. While playing soccer, they meet a charismatic cleric who eventually leads them to execute a suicide attack on a Connex-Killen tanker using an explosive from the missing Tehran missile.  ===Merger storyline=== Bennett Holiday meets with Dean Whiting, who is convinced that Killen bribed someone to get the drilling rights in [[Kazakhstan]]. While investigating Connex-Killen's records, Holiday discovers a wire transfer of funds that leads back to a transaction between Texas oilman and Killen colleague Danny Dalton and Kazakh officials. Holiday tells Connex-Killen of his discovery, and they pretend not to have known about it. Holiday advises Dalton that he will likely be charged with corruption in order to serve as a "body" to get the DOJ off the back of the rest of Connex-Killen. [[U.S. Attorney]] Donald Farish III then strong-arms Holiday into giving the DOJ information about illegal activities he has discovered. Holiday gives up Dalton, but Farish says this is not enough. Holiday meets with the CEO of Killen Oil, Jimmy Pope, and informs him that the DOJ needs a second body in order to drop the investigation. Pope asks Holiday whether a person at Holiday's firm above him would be sufficient as the additional body. Holiday acknowledges that if the name were big enough, the DOJ would stop the investigation and allow the merger.  Holiday is brought by his colleague and mentor Sydney Hewitt to meet with the Chairman & CEO of Connex Oil, Leland "Lee" Janus. Holiday reveals an under-the-table deal that Hewitt made while the Connex-Killen merger was being processed. Holiday has given Hewitt to the DOJ as the second body, thereby protecting the rest of Connex-Killen. Janus is able to accept the "Oil Industry Man of the Year" award with a load taken off his shoulders.

Arjumand Bano is Asaf Khan's (Aly Khan) daughter, Empress Noor Jahan's brother. Khurram and Bano again meet at the Meena Bazaar, where finally both of them declare their love for each other. Ladli Begum comes to know about their love, but she keeps on wooing Prince Khurram. Noor Jahan sees this love as a hindrance to her plans of making her daughter the future Empress of India and she succeeds in turning Emperor Jahangir against his own son, Khurram.  Noor Jahan sends her secret lover and the warrior Mahabat Khan (Milind Gunaji) to fight Khurram and to kill Arjumand Bano. As a result, a war takes place in which forces are also sent by Emperor Jahangir against Khurram. When Khurram meets Jahangir, he declares that Arjumand Bano was more superior to him than the Mughal Dynasty. As a result, relations become even more bitter between the father and the son. However Arjumand Bano, who was a peace-loving person, agreed to forget Khurram and asked him to marry Kandahari Begum (Negar Khan), an Iranian Princess, who was chosen by Emperor Jahangir for Khurram. Khurram, due to Arjumand's insistence, marries Kandahari Begum while on the other hand, Ladli Begum marries to Khurram's brother. After Emperor Jahangir dies, Khurram becomes Prince Shah Jahan and ruler of the Mughal dynasty. He finally marries the love of his life, Arjumand Bano, who becomes Mumtaz Mahal. The couple live happily for a while until misfortune occurs.  Khurram must leave for war, but a pregnant Aarjumand chooses to also go with him, as she used to accompany Shah Jahan in all his battles. Khurram tries to return to the camp from the battle, but takes a long time to return as he forgets his way. While he is lost, Mumtaz Mahal dies while giving birth to her nineteenth child. During her last breath, Mumtaz Mahal asks Shah Jahan to construct her tomb in a beautiful mausoleum, describing one which would be so beautiful it would express their love for each other to all who visit the mausoleum. Mumtaz's death is the greatest tragedy for Shah Jahan, and as a result he becomes a completely reformed person. Shah Jahan then starts off to fulfill his wife's last wish, to build Taj Mahal, a beautiful mausoleum to honour the also beautiful Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal goes on to become the Seventh Wonder of the World.  Time passes, and in future Shah Jahan's sons and daughter grow up. The sons are greedy and eager to inherit their father powers, and as a result they imprison him in a room from where he can easily see Taj Mahal. He watches his sons fighting against each other to become the Emperor of India and the Mughal Dynasty. Everywhere around him there is violence and warfare, with the beheading of slaves and even brothers is no longer uncommon. In the end, Khurram dies while looking at Taj Mahal, the Taj Mahal that took an astonishing 22 years to be made, a tribute showing Shah Jahan as the greatest lover of all time. At his death, his body is laid down next to his love, hence resulting in the culmination of their love after death.<ref>[http://movies.dcealumni.com/archives/movie-review-taj-mahal/ Plot review]</ref>

 Set in a small waterfront town in coastal [[Maryland]], ''Swimmers'' is a film that focuses on Emma Tyler, a fiercely intelligent and observant 11-year-old who develops an ear problem requiring surgery that the Tylers can ill afford. Emma's father, Will, drinks a lot and lives hand to mouth as a waterman. Her mother, Julia, has become a miserable soul, trying to keep a household together on meager funds.

Swarmed (film)
 Kent Horvath ([[Michael Shanks]]) is a scientist, trying to invent a new [[pesticide]], specifically for [[yellow jacket]] [[wasp]]s. He tests its effectiveness out on eight yellow jackets, finding that it successfully kills six, but the two who survived now have extremely high [[pheromone]] levels, resulting in increased aggression.  That night, the janitor (John Baktins) accidentally releases them, and they both attack, killing him.  They find his body the next morning, along with one of the wasps, with the other one nowhere to be found.  His body is taken to the [[morgue]], where the mortician (Claudio Masciulli) hears a buzzing from the janitor's mouth, and opens it, freeing the second wasp that had somehow trapped itself. It then proceeds to sting him until he is dead before flying away. Meanwhile, Cristina Brown ([[Carol Alt]]), an insectologist, teaches a class about [[bee]]s. One young man ([[Mazin Elsadig]]) relates to her a story about how he was once stung by a wasp, and suddenly six or seven others attacked him.  She explains that when an insect attacks, it releases an attack pheromone, signalling all the others of their kind that there is an immediate threat in the area.  The class is cut short when she is called in about the dead mortician. Agent Doug Heydon, ([[Booth Savage]]) tells her about the dead janitor and Kent's research, prompting her to investigate the possibility of a link between the two deaths.  Meanwhile, Kent's exterminator friend, Q ([[Richard Chevolleau]]) is called by a family with a yellow jacket infestation. He finds himself low on pesticide and goes to Kent to restock. Kent warns him not to use any of the experimental pesticide, but a curious Q mixes it with the regular solution.  As he sprays the nest, the analysis of the hyper-aggressive wasp's venom completes. Kent learns in shock that pesticide caused a genetic mutation in the wasp's chemical structure, resulting in incredibly potent venom along with the hyper-aggression.  In the meantime, the Chief of Police ([[Bill Lake]]) blackmails Mayor Gibson (Christopher Bondy) with evidence that he has been making covert meetings with Phineas Washburn ([[Tim Thomerson]]), the owner of ''Washburn's Tasty Sauce''. He makes it known that Washburn made a large financial contribution to Gibson's reelection campaign, giving him large sway in many political matters. The Chief very openly suggests' to Gibson that he will reveal this information to the public if he doesn't get a payoff. He leaves with Gibson furious.  At his workshop, Q puts the sprayed nest in his trash compactor, but about one quarter of the nest survives, including the queen. They chase Q to his truck, where he manages to administer [[antivenom]] before passing out.  The wasps then leave and begin sending off attack pheromones, which not only attract multiple other swarms, but also mutate them to have extremely potent venom similar to the sprayed swarm. Meanwhile, Cristina and Kent go to the home of a man who was stung to death by the swarm after they were attracted to the raw meat patties on his grill.  They find a dead wasp on his clothes and take it back to the lab for analysis. Meanwhile, Q is awoken by Rafe (Jonathan Malen), the teenager he's watching for the summer, where they agree to hunt down the remaining portion of the swarm themselves.  Back at the lab, the venom results show that the lethality is identical to the strength of the wasp that killed the janitor. After informing Agent Heydon, they all agree that the annual burger cook-off will attract the swarm directly to the populace. Heydon goes to warn the Chief, as they attempt to tell Washburn that they have to cancel the cook-off. However, neither party believes them, rather threatening them with legal action if they dare interfere with the cook-off.  Just after Heydon leaves the Chief, the swarm is attracted to his rare steak, and kill him when he tries to fight back. Eventually, Q and Rafe use a pheromone detector to track down the part of the swarm that stayed behind to finish off the steak. Q uses a [[flamethrower]] to kill the swarm, but melts part of his van in the process.  Meanwhile, the single wasp that first killed the janitor finds its way to Mayor Gibson's office, and kills him by stinging his eye. His assistant, Ellie Martin, ([[Ellen Dubin]]) finds his body, and chases the wasp with a double-barreled shotgun, eventually killing it. The cook-off finally starts, and Heydon comes to try to convince Washburn that they have to shut it down. But before he can, the swarm arrives and begins to attack the crowd, including killing a sadistic reporter, Melanie Sheer (Maria Brooks), while her cameraman, Chuey (BalÃ¡zs KoÃ³s), video tapes.  Washburn attempts to hide in a [[dunk tank]], but is killed when two wasps crawl down the hose he is breathing through and sting his mouth. Eventually, Kent and Cristina arrive and begin administering antivenom to the stung, using tire patching spray to close up the wasps' breathing holes. Q also arrives and begins attracting the wasps to a golf cart, in hopes of trapping them inside a garage.  While he does so, Kent, Cristina, and Rafe begin gathering [[Fuel tank|petrol tank]]s and [[gasoline]], so as to destroy the swarm once they get it trapped. Q manages to get the wasps inside, and they ignite the gas with Rafe's lighter. However, the queen manages to escape the inferno, and makes a run for Q, but is sucked up by Rafe with the portable vacuum cleaner he was given to clean up any wasp carcases; he throws it into the fire.  The scenes fades to Kent and Cristina, now dating, going to dinner.  The camera then zooms up to the charred vacuum, revealing that the queen managed to survive the blaze and is in the process of laying eggs.

Takeshis'
  ''Takeshis'' progresses through the nested storyline of the dual [[protagonists]], Beat Takeshi and Mr. Kitano (both played by Kitano himself). Beat Takeshi, a prominent actor, meets a look-alike named Mr. Kitano, who is a struggling actor. After the meeting, Mr. Kitano's dreams take a violent, surreal turn.  The film opens with a nightmare vision. [[Military of the United States|American soldiers]] with [[carbines]] move down the fallen base filled up with bodies of Japanese combatants. One of dying combatants appears to be (Beat or Kitano) Takeshi. This opening scene is followed by the gun battle of a [[yakuza film]] where one of the protagonists, 'Beat' Takeshi, plays the principal role. [[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]]s of this gun battle are frequently used throughout the film.  'Beat' Takeshi is a [[Show business|showbiz]] star. He lives through business in film studio and [[TV stations]] where main casts appear in one of their dual roles (Takeshi's Girlfriend ([[Kotomi Kyono]]), Takeshi's Manager ([[Ren Osugi]]), and Takeshi's former partner of [[stand-up comedy]] ([[Susumu Terajima]])).  The first appearance sequence of 'Beat' Takeshi also introduces some repetitive motives of ''Takeshis''. (The caterpillar in a bouquet, a [[female impersonator]] of [[taishÅ« engeki]] ([[Taichi Saotome]]), tap dancers in a rehearsal set, [[Akihiro Miwa]] (a [[transvestite]] [[chanson]] singer), a pair of fat twins, and dialogs at a [[ramen]] restaurant repeated later in varied situations.)  Mr. Kitano, the other protagonist, appears in a clown costume among the guys in a wardrobe of TV station. Mr. Kitano is an everyman, obsessed with his appearance identical to 'Beat' Takeshi. When two Takeshis encounter for the first time, Mr. Kitano seeks his heartthrob charisma's [[autograph]]. 'Beat' Takeshi gives the autograph to him.  Kitano, earning a living as a [[convenience store]] clerk, never gets ahead as an actor. He begins to fantasize himself as 'Beat' Takeshi in daydreams. Fragments of surreal dream crosses over into his life. We see bizarre things accompanied by dead bodies on the road while he is moonlighting as a taxi driver.   Kitano then happens to pick up a gun at a [[yakuza]] quarrel. He shoots first his yakuza neighbor ([[Susumu Terajima]]), and begins to kill people around his world. The film implies it is some kind of a dream, showing deceased guys appear again in blood and yell alive normally. Kitano takes out his female neighbor ([[Kotomi Kyono]]) and commits a [[bank robbery]]. Accomplishing his fantasies of acting like a movie star 'Beat' Takeshi, Kitano takes a journey into the absolutely bizarre, surreal world (an underground nightclub, night gun battles, and the [[Disaster|catastrophe]] at a ''[[Boiling Point (1990 film)|Boiling Point]]''-, or ''[[Sonatine (1993 film)|Sonatine]]''-like tropical island).  Cut suddenly back to Kitano's real life where he is still confused himself and 'Beat' Takeshi. He finds the movie star's autograph greeting, "Hello Mr. Clown!". It triggers 'Beat' Takeshi's [[assassination]] by Mr. Kitano. Cut suddenly again back to a close-up of 'Beat' Takeshi, which implies all of the film might be a dream of 'Beat' Takeshi. The film ends with flashback images of an American Soldier and the gun battle of a yakuza film at the beginning.

When an accident leaves his ape mother, [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]], thinking that Tarzan has died after the gorillas have crossed a ravine, the other apes feel that Tarzan has reached a fitting end. Tarzan believes itâs best for everyone involved if he runs away.  Alone in the jungle, Tarzan gets pursued by [[Sabor (Tarzan)|Sabor]] the leopardess right to a rocky place known as the Dark Mountain. When the echo of the monster calls, Sabor runs away just as Tarzan is inhabited by two hulking, spoiled gorilla brothers, [[Uto and Kago (Tarzan II)|Uto and Kago]], and their controlling, over-protective Mama Gunda, but they fear the Zugor as much as Tarzan does, and when the booming call of the monster again echoes through the valley, the trio flee and Tarzan is able to escape Dark Mountain. He encounters a crotchety old gorilla who at first keeps the boy distant, but Tarzan discovers that this old gorilla is actually the Zugor, who uses hollow trees as megaphones to amplify his voice and pretend to be a monster to scare other jungle creatures away from his territory and food. Tarzan uses this discovery to force Zugor into letting the boy stay with him. Thanks to Tarzan's cheerfulness and helpfulness, Zugor begins to warm up to him as Tarzan continues to try to figure out what he is along with Zugor, but they both promise not to tell anyone.  Tarzan's two best friends, [[Terk (Tarzan)|Terk]] and [[Tantor]], come looking for him and Kala also finds out that Tarzan is alive, so she goes looking for him as well.

Then, Terk and Tantor eventually reunite with Tarzan and become best friends once again and leave Dark Mountain in which Mama Gunda, Uto and Kago follow them. Tarzan does not want to return home with them but he reveals that there is no monster, in which Mama Gunda, Uto and Kago hear their conversation and discover Zugor who was the actual monster and he gets himself into trouble. Uto and Kago wreck his tree house for revenge and with that, Zugor blames Tarzan for breaking his promise and runs away, refusing to help in which Terk and Tantor run to go and warn Kerchak. Kala arrives near Dark Mountain and also encounters trouble with Mama Gunda, Uto and Kago in which Tarzan finally realizes what he is supposed to be: a ''Tarzan'', with his own special tricks that no one else can do in the jungle, (which the answer is figured out by Zugor before he returns and becomes friends again with Tarzan).   Tarzan is able to use tricks and traps, defeating Uto and Kago as Terk and Tantor try to save Kala as she begins to fall off a cliff, but Tarzan saves Kala just in time whereas Zugor helds hostage on Mama Gunda, but due to their connection and Zugor accidentally calling her âbeautiful eyesâ, they both fall in love. Uto and Kago return and are schocked to see them together. Tarzan tells Kala that she was right before, and that he is a part of his family and Terk and Tantor again reunite with Tarzan. Tarzan, Kala, Terk and Tantor return to the gorilla troop and the film ends when Kala gives Tarzan a hug and tells him how proud she is of him for rescuing her from the fall and from Uto and Kago, after which Mama Gunda punishes them for destroying Zugor's tree house and orders them that there wonât be any more fighting or wrecking things. Tarzan, Terk and Tantor play a monster game, in which Tarzan is now happy and proud of himself that he knows what he is supposed to be.  
Tango Charlie
  The story starts off with two [[Indian Air Force]] helicopter pilots (Squadron Leader Vikram Rathore and Flight Lieutenant Shezad Khan, played by [[Sanjay Dutt]] and [[Sunil Shetty]] respectively) discovering a mass pile of dead rebels and an Indian trooper appearing to be dead in the Kashmir valley. They later discover he's alive and find out who he is by reading his diary.  === In the North-East ===  The tale revolves around an Indian [[Border Security Force]] trooper named Tarun Chauhan ([[Bobby Deol]]) in the 101st BSF Battalion arriving in the northeastern India. While walking through the jungle searching for his platoon commander, he was caught in a trap and hung upside down. It is later revealed that Havaldar (Sergeant) Mohammad Ali ([[Ajay Devgn]]) set the trap and calls him an "idiot" for falling into it. He meets the rest of the squad where he gets his job as platoon cook. On being asked why he joined the Border Security Force, he says it is to protect his country from any harm. Havaldar Ali says that whoever has made that comment is nothing but a [[hypocrite]]. He tells him that the terrorist have massacred many innocent people and are not afraid to kill them as well. Chauhan later acknowledges his codename "Tango Charlie" and learns Havaldar Ali's codename is "Mike Alpha."  One day on a patrol, the platoon accidentally kills one of their own as a set trap by the terrorist. The entire platoon goes mad with grief over the mistake. Then another young soldier is kidnapped and has his stomach sliced open and is left as bait. Chauhan finds this shocking and totally unbelievable. Havaldar Ali tells his overly emotional troopers to think that he's dead and focus on killing the terrorists. The dying soldier continues to scream in pain. Chauhan tries to stop one of the overly emotional soldiers from giving the wounded soldier [[morphine]]. Another member of the platoon falls into the trap and is shot dead. The screaming soldier then dies. Chauhan and Mike Alpha (Havaldar Ali) take aim and fire. They kill most of the rebels but others, as well as their leader, escape.  At night, Chauhan and Havaldar Ali search for the remaining rebels and kill them off one by one. When the leader tries to escape by boat, both of them swim over and knock them off. They engage in hand-to-hand combat; Mike Alpha slits the throat of the rebels leader with his own machete. Chauhan tries to kill the other rebel but finds out that it's a young boy. He holds a knife to his face.  {| class="toccolours" style="float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; colour:black; width:28em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5" | style="text-align: left;"|"Adding a new and much needed dimension to the traditional Indian war epic, ''Tango Charlie'' is a brave attempt at examining war and what it means to different people.

He is happily welcomed home by his family and friends. He finds out that he's going to be engaged to Lachchi Narayan ([[Tanishaa Mukerji|Tanisha]]), an educated [[computer engineer]]. Chauhan has beliefs about her views, but they are changed by her. They fall in love, and Chauhan pledges that he will come back to her alive.  === Fighting Naxals in Andhra ===  A few months later Chauhan and the rest of Mike Alpha's platoon are transferred to the southern state of [[Andhra Pradesh]] to counter the [[Naxalites]] terrorists wreaking havoc on the countryside. Platoon are riding in a convoy while protecting a high-ranking colonel's wife and young children. As the convoy approaches the city of [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], the rebels notice it and signal one of their own. He then presses the detonator and sets off a planted [[improvised explosive device|IED]] under the jeep, killing the colonel and his family. They fire on the trucks, causing Mike Alpha's platoon to take cover in a rocky part beside the road while the rebels hunt them down. They use an [[rocket-propelled grenade|RPG launcher]] to flush out the troopers but fail. Chauhan and the rest of the platoon kill the rebels. Chauhan chases a rebel; another BSF trooper attempts to rape her. Chauhan intervenes by pulling him off. He then sees the rebel kill herself with her own assault rifle. The other BSF trooper tries to kill Chauhan for his intervention but he kills him in self-defense. Mike Alpha discovers the whole thing and Chauhan tries to surrender himself saying that he's willing to give into any punishment given to him. Mike Alpha says he did the right thing.  === Hindu-Muslim riots in Gujarat ===  {{Quote box  |quote = "It dares to enter where the national media shies away. <br />It talks of the Northeast. It talks of Manipur. It talks of the <br />Maoists in Telangana. Director Mani Shankar <br />dares to embrace themes we thought Bollywood<br /> was incapable of even touching."  |source = ''[[The Hindu]]'' (Friday, Apr 01, 2005).<ref name="autogenerated1" /> }}  On their next assignment, he is surprised to know that the platoon will now try to quench the Hindu-Muslim religious riots taking place in the western province of [[Gujarat]]. Upon arriving at the chaotic scene, the police chief desperately tries to calm the crowd. When he is shot and killed by an extremist, Mike Alpha (Havaldar Mohammed Ali) orders the platoon to open fire. Many innocent people are killed in the volley. Chauhan spots the extremist and tries to shoot him. He accidentally hits a bystander who pops into the way.  After the chaos, Chauhan goes to the victim's family for forgiveness. Instead of forgiving him, they nearly beat him to death even after he tells them that it was a mistake. Mike Alpha intervenes and tells them that the BSF isn't here to kill innocent people but to stop people from committing acts of violence. While in a military hospital, Havaldar Ali tells his own tragic story in which he was assigned to save the family of a rich landlord from Naxalites in [[West Bengal|Bengal]]. The terrorists were able to kill almost everyone at the landlord's daughter's wedding. Even with all the effort, he and his group miserably failed; the daughter was killed by the terrorists before Mike Alpha finished them off. He claims it was the first time that he listened to his heart and not to his brains.  Chauhan gets a letter saying that Lachchi Narayan is getting married to another person. He dashes home and realises that it was a trap set by her to see how much he loved her. The next day she steals his diary and reads it. She is shocked by the events Chauhan had witnessed. She apologises and they soon get married.  === In Kashmir ===  The [[Kargil War|Kargil conflict]] between India and Pakistan begins. Mike Alpha's platoon and the battalion move out to [[Kashmir]] where they are assigned to defend a bridge. Mike Alpha gives Chauhan a strict order: Shoot anyone who doesn't say a password after three tries.  One day a high-ranking military officer comes to the bridge; he doesn't know the password ("rainfall"). Chauhan shoots one of the guards which enrages the officer who threatens him with a [[court martial]]. The officer tries to kill him, and Mike Alpha intervenes. The officer is a disguised terrorist helping Pakistani forces get off with ease. Chauhan takes cover while the terrorists kill off most of the platoon. Mike Alpha kills a large number of the terrorists before being approached by a real battalion of soldiers who give him the password. Mike Alpha salutes them and then dies of his severe wounds. Chauhan vows revenge. He arms himself to the teeth and stalks the terrorists to their base. He wires the place with explosives. The terrorist leader discovers one of the explosive attachments and tries to stop one of his men. Unfortunately he opens the door and the explosives go off, killing the rest of the terrorists. Chauhan then goes into the terrorist leader's place and shoots him dead before being wounded. He collapses into the snow.  He's rescued by the helicopter pilots featured earlier in the film who take him to a village doctor who treats him off his wounds. Later the pilots are rewarded for their actions in finding Tango Charlie. His dead friend and mentor Havaldar Ali gets rewarded.  
Tennis no Åjisama â Futari no Samurai
 The Seishun Academy Middle School tennis regulars are invited on a cruise by Sakurafubuki Hikomaro to play a match with his own tennis team. Aboard the cruise ship, Ryoga Echizen introduces himself to the team as [[List of The Prince of Tennis characters#Ryoma Echizen|Ryoma]]'s older brother. Ryoma reveals that Ryoga was adopted by Nanjiroh many years ago, when they lived in [[United States|America]], but mysteriously left home prior to Ryoma enrolling in Seigaku. That evening, after a banquet dinner, [[List of The Prince of Tennis characters#Takashi Kawamura|Takashi Kawamura]], being a sushi chef, remarks that the food did not taste as expensive as it looked. In the bathroom, [[List of The Prince of Tennis characters#Sadaharu Inui|Sadaharu Inui]] discovers that the marble on the wall is fake when he tears off a piece of wallpaper. It becomes clear that something is not right. The next day, Sakurafubuki reveals to Tezuka and Oishi that they are actually part of an illegal gambling plot. If they purposely lose their matches the next day, Sakurafubuki will rake in a lot of money from people that have betted on Seigaku winning. But, should they choose not listen and win the matches, the team faces the grim possibility of losing their lives.   It turns out that everyone on the ship are either gamblers or Sakurafubuki's henchmen, so therefore, Seigaku can only trust themselves. The team tries to form a plan of action while playing the matches as directed, but they are ultimately held hostage by Sakurafubuki's chef when [[List of The Prince of Tennis characters#Eiji Kikumaru|Kikumaru Eiji]] is caught eavesdropping. Only Tezuka, Fuji, and Echizen are allowed to leave to play their matches. Tezuka and Fuji win their matches easily. Upon seeing Ryoma's performance, Ryoga decides to betray Sakurafubuki in order to play a match against his brother to see who's the better player.   Meanwhile, the rest of the team escape from the room where the chef held them hostage (thanks to Inui's clever usage of his Juice), and then are forced to engage in a rather humorous run from the corrupt crew members. In the end, they are recaptured and bound by Sakurafubuki, who holds them at gunpoint. Ryoma realizes that his teammates' lives are going to be at risk if he continues to play against his brother.  Fortunately, Ryoga decides that he will not be Sakurafubuki's pawn any longer, and fires a tennis ball straight into his forehead. This allows the rest of the team to escape once again. As Ryoma and Ryoga's match continues, a terrible storm brews, forcing everyone on the ship to evacuate through the lifeboats. Seigaku keeps order throughout the panic and helps the passengers, although Momoshiro and Eiji end up falling overboard. The Echizen brothers, however, keep playing their match, even as an enormous tidal wave descends upon the cruise ship. They seem unfazed as they play their match underwater. In the end, Ryoma comes out as the victor when the ball drops onto Ryoga's side of the net, despite that the net is gone and a large light has crashed across the court. Ryoga accepts his defeat and remarks that Ryoma's tennis certainly has improved. The two escape via Ryoga's jet ski, and Ryoma is reunited with his team, who have all escaped the ship unharmed. Ryoga takes Ryoma's hat and gives him an orange and tells him to find his "Grand Dream". After that, he rides his jet ski into the sunset.  [[List of The Prince of Tennis characters#Hyoutei Academy|Atobe Keigo]] then arrives at the scene by helicopter to rescue the Seigaku regulars and witnesses Sakurafubuki being arrested. In an earlier phone conversation he had with Oshitari Yuushi, who also appeared along [[List of The Prince of Tennis characters#Hyoutei Academy|Gakuto Mukahi]], the two conversed about how Seigaku had been invited aboard a free cruise. Atobe remarked how he knew all luxury cruise line owners, but never heard of Sakurafubuki, and thus suspected that Seigaku had been caught up in a scam.  
Tamara (2005 film)
 Tamara Riley is a shy and unattractive but intelligent girl who likes [[witchcraft]] and has a crush on Bill Natolly, her handsome English teacher. When a critical article she writes about the school's athletes is published, two of the star athletes, Shawn and Patrick, want revenge. Tamara attempts to perform a magical ritual to bind her fate to that of her teacher, but when she must spill her own blood she ceases the ritual. That night, a prank is orchestrated by Shawn and Patrick, along with Shawn's girlfriend Kisha. Shawn calls Tamara, impersonating Mr. Natolly, and invites her to a motel room. A video camera is placed there and catches Tamara undressing. Shawn, Patrick, and Kisha [[Voyeurism|watch this]], along with three others who did not know about the prank (Chloe, Jesse and Roger). Shawn comes in and taunts Tamara, and Tamara is accidentally killed in a struggle. Despite Chloe's demands that they inform the police, she is blackmailed into helping bury Tamara. However, they are shocked when Tamara walks into class, looking more attractive than ever before. They convince themselves that she was only unconscious and dug her way out of the ground. That night, while Roger is watching a film in the school audiovisual room, the image on the screen suddenly changes to the video of Tamara's murder.  Roger removes the tape and is confronted by Tamara. She torments him with hallucinations of what it is like to be [[Premature burial|buried alive]] and with his history of [[Self-harm|cutting himself]]. The next day, he sends a televised message to the entire school in which he proclaims that one should "[[Three wise monkeys|hear no evil, speak no evil, and see no evil]]". He then cuts off his ear and tongue with a razor blade, then stabs himself in the eye, which kills him. Tamara then visits the home of Mr. Natolly, intending to seduce him. However, when he resists her, she says that "it is only a matter of time". The next day, she visits the school guidance counselor, Allison Natolly, the wife of Mr. Natolly. Tamara confronts Allison, mentioning Allison and Bill's infertility problems. Realizing that her father fantasizes about [[Incest|having sex with her]] and that his [[alcoholism]] drove her mother away, Tamara makes him "finish the bottle", requiring him to eat a beer bottle. At a party, Tamara puts a spell on Patrick and Shawn, and forces them to have sex with each other. Kisha attempts to stop Tamara, but is incapacitated when Tamara begins to talk about Kisha's eating disorder. Tamara tells Kisha that she is "skin and bone, and really should eat more". Kisha begins to eat herself into a stupor, but is taken away by Jesse and Chloe. When Chloe and Jesse call Mr. Natolly and tell him about what happened, Kisha (still under the spell) calls Tamara and tells her that Mr. Natolly knows. Kisha is knocked out by Chloe.  Chloe, Jesse and Mr. Natolly go to Tamara's house, where they find the corpse of Tamara's father and a spellbook describing the ritual Tamara tried to perform. They realize that when they killed Tamara that night, her blood was spilled. It was because of Tamara's blood being spilled that the ritual was completed and allowed her to rise from the grave as what she is. Meanwhile, Tamara, learning of what the others know, sends Shawn and Patrick to the Natolly residence to kill Allison. They try, but Allison kills them both in self-defense by stabbing Patrick in the neck with a utility knife and impaling Shawn with a broken shovel. Kisha and Allison are both taken to the hospital and treated, but Kisha wakes up and chases down Jesse and Chloe, resulting in Jesse's death when Kisha stabs Jesse multiple times with a carving knife, only for Chloe to knock her out and escape, but Jesse dies from blood loss later on. In the film's climax on the hospital roof, Mr. Natolly, Allison, Chloe and Tamara finally confront each other. Tamara attempts to control Chloe, but sees through her memories that Chloe actually cared about her and realizes that she has become a monster. She breaks down and slowly changes back into a corpse. Before fading away, Tamara asserts her will to be with Mr. Natolly and he appears to surrender to the inevitable. Mr. Natolly holds Tamara close and kisses her, then throws himself off the roof with Tamara. In the end, Chloe and Allison are fine. The camera pans back to the spellbook in the jeep, open at Part 6, "Resurrection and Immortality". The film ends implying Tamara is [[Demonic possession|possessing]] Kisha, and steals the book.  
Tale of Cinema
 As the film begins, Sangwon, an aimless and indecisive college student on school holiday after final examinations, avoids walking together with his older brother by instead taking a side street, where he finds a former girlfriend, Yongsil, working at an optician's store. Unsure of his own emotional preparedness in rekindling the relationship, he decides to watch a play while waiting for her to complete her work shift, delaying the decision to meet her later in the evening. The final words of anguish in the play, uttered by a desperately ill child unable to be comforted by his mother, would later be echoed by Sangwon from the rooftop of his parents' apartment after his own failed act of despair. In the film's corollary chapter, Tongsu, a struggling, rootless, and inscrutable filmmaker who has become obsessed with a short film directed by his former classmate - and in particular, the devoted and obliging woman in the film - encounters the young actress in person and begins to ingratiate himself into her company, acting out his projected image of her by imitating gestures and revisiting locations from the film in an attempt to realize his own created image of her.

Thank You for Smoking
 Nick Naylor is a handsome, smooth-talking tobacco [[lobbying|lobbyist]] and the [[vice-president]] of a [[tobacco politics|tobacco lobby]] called the "Academy of Tobacco Studies", which for 15 years has been "researching" the link between [[tobacco smoking]] and [[lung cancer]]. They claim that their researchâfunded primarily by tobacco companiesâhas found no definitive evidence of any linkage. Naylor's job consists mainly of reporting the questionable research of the "Academy" to the public and defending [[Big Tobacco]] on television programs by questioning opposing health claims and advocating personal choice. Naylor and his friends, firearm lobbyist Bobby Jay Bliss and alcohol lobbyist Polly Bailey, meet every week and jokingly call themselves the "Merchants of Death" or "The MOD Squad".  As anti-tobacco campaigns mount and numbers of young smokers decline, Naylor suggests that [[product placement]] of cigarettes could once again boost cigarette sales. Naylor's boss, BR, sends Naylor to [[Los Angeles]] to bargain for cigarette placement in upcoming movies. Naylor takes along his young son, Joey, in hopes of bonding with him. The next day, Naylor is sent to meet with Lorne Lutch, the [[cancer]]-stricken man who once played the [[Marlboro Man]] in cigarette ads and is now campaigning against cigarettes.  As his son watches, Naylor successfully offers Lutch a suitcase of money for his silence. During the drive back, Nick and Joey discuss the beauty of argument.  Senator Finistirre, one of Naylor's most vehement critics, is the promoter of a bill to add a [[Skull and crossbones (poison)|skull and crossbones POISON warning]] to cigarette packaging. During a televised debate with Finistirre, Naylor receives a death threat from a caller. Despite the threat, Naylor still plans to appear before a [[U.S. Senate]] committee to fight Finistirre's bill. Naylor is then kidnapped and covered in [[nicotine patch]]es. Awakening in a hospital, he learns that the very high nicotine tolerance level resulting from his smoking has saved him from death by [[nicotine poisoning]], but now he is [[Hypersensitivity|hypersensitive]] to nicotine and can never smoke again.  Meanwhile, Naylor has been seduced by a young reporter named Heather Holloway. During their steamy fling, the besotted Naylor tells Holloway all about his life and careerâinformation that she happily publishes in an exposÃ© that appears just after the kidnapping. Her article relentlessly criticizes Naylor and his work, exposing Lutch's bribe, the product-placement scheme, and the MOD squad. It accuses Naylor of training his son Joey to follow his amoral example. All public sympathy due to Naylor's kidnapping evaporates, and Naylor is fired by BR.  Naylor falls into depression until Joey helps him recall the integrity in his job of defending corporations that almost no one feels deserve a defense. Rejuvenated, Naylor tells the press about his affair with Holloway and promises to clear the names of everyone mentioned in her article. He also declares that he will still appear before the Senate committee. At the hearing, Naylor admits to the dangers of smoking but argues that public awareness is already high enough without extra warnings. He emphasizes consumer choice and responsibility and, to the dismay of Senator Finistirre, claims that if tobacco companies are guilty of tobacco-related deaths, then perhaps Finistirre's state of [[Vermont]], as a major cheese producer, is likewise guilty of [[cholesterol]]-related deaths.  BR congratulates Naylor on the speech and offers him his old job but Naylor has a change of heart. Seeing Big Tobacco [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement|settling claims of liability]], Naylor remarks that he has left just in time. He also mentions Heather was humiliated upon being terminated by the paper for her article and is working as a weather reporter on a local news station. Naylor supports his son's newfound interest in debating and opens a private lobbying firm. The MOD squad continues to meet with new members that represent the fast-food, oil, and biohazard industries. As he consults cellphone industry representatives concerned about [[Mobile phone radiation and health|claims that cellphones cause brain cancer]], he narrates: "[[Michael Jordan]] plays ball. [[Charles Manson]] kills people. I talk. Everyone has a talent."

Thavamai Thavamirundhu
 The movie begins with Muthiah ([[Rajkiran|Raj Kiran]]) being admitted into the hospital due to a serious head injury. The incident that led to the injury is kept in suspense for the audience. The story is narrated by the man's second son Ramalingam ([[Cheran (director)|Cheran]]), when he comes to visit his father in the hospital. Overcome by emotions, he recollects, along his trip, bits and pieces of memories from his younger days with his father. The first part of the story is about how a father in a lower middle class family struggles to raise his children. The father runs a printing press and works really hard to make ends meet, but still has to borrow money from the exploitive local moneylenders to give his sons a good education. There is a scene where the children are eagerly expecting their father to return home with gifts during festive season, and the father encounters a setback in the cash flow in his business, and yet seizes an opportunity to make some money by working throughout the night. This scene encapsulates the sacrifices the father makes for the his sons' happiness.  Then the story moves to the teenage years of the children where they find it hard to resist the temptations of the adolescent stage of life. Ramalingam is a good student and gets admitted to an engineering college where he gradually falls in love with his classmate. Ramalingam finds freedom when he moves from his home to his college residence. When Ramalingam is madly in love with the girl, there is an opportunity for them to have moments of privacy, and they succumb to temptation. This leads to an accidental pregnancy and raises questions about their future.  Meanwhile, Ramalingam's brother Ramanathan ([[Mirchi Senthil]]) was married and just had a child. Ramanathan has a misunderstanding with his father and walks out of his parent's home. The main cause of friction within the family is the lack of privacy for Ramanathan and his wife ([[Meenal]]), and a lack of freedom for the young couple to run the day-to-day affairs of their family.  Alas, the father expects the sons to help him repay the loans he had to borrow for their education. During this chaos, Ramalingam is not able find an opportunity to confess his mistake to his parents.  As time runs out, Ramalingam and his lover Vasanthi ([[Padmapriya]]) elope to Chennai, unable to reveal the truth about the pregnancy to their respective parents and face a very uncertain future. They decide to get married and search for jobs. He is unable to find a well-paying job and takes up a job in a printing press as a stop-gap arrangement. Ramalingam has to console Vasanthi in a few situations when he himself is facing a lot of trials and tribulations. They are a loving couple in spite of being in a poor financial situation. Vasanthi eventually gives birth to a daughter, but Ramalingam struggles to pay for medical expenses. He calls his former classmate and borrows money from his friend. The friend informs Ramalingam's father about Ramalingam's situation. Muthiah comes to meet Ramalingam and gives him some cash for the sake of the new born child. He also recalls how he himself faced a cash crunch when Ramalingam was born. Ramalingam and Vasanthi are touched by Muthiah's gesture and decide to move back to Ramalingam's village to get the support from his family in raising the child. They find acceptance from their parents and are relieved by the acceptance. Slowly, Ramalingam finds a good job and moves up in his career. The family becomes more comfortable and they move to Madurai. They become very close-knit. Ramalingam is a very responsible son who really cares for his parents.  Ramalingam facilitates a family reunion with his brother's family and they reconcile with each other. Ramalingam and Vasanthi create the perfect family with their love and care. Ramalingam's mother Saradha ([[Saranya Ponvannan]]) passes away after many years of happy and satisfying family life with Ramalingam's family. After Saradha's final rites, Muthiah decides to stay in the village to relive the days he spent with his deceased wife. Ramanathan comes to his father to ask for some financial help by selling their family home in the village, and Muthiah gets upset. While upset, Muthiah slips and falls into a well. He is treated in the hospital, but succumbs to his injuries and passes away.  The movie briefly touches upon other relationships too, such as the relationship of married couples and of two brothers. The main story, however, revolves around the important role a father plays in today's society. It sensitively portrays the struggles of a father whose main priority in life is the well-being of his children, and who is determined to see his children grow up to become decent, successful people.  It also conveys how love and affection can immensely help a family tide over all the highs and lows of life. This movie is really special in the sense that there are many Indian films that touch upon maternity and the central role of a mother in the well-being of a family, but this is one of the few films that focuses on the important role played by the father in a family.  It is a very touching portrayal of the parental roles â the father by Rajkiran and the mother by Saranya Ponvannan. The director, Cheran, has excelled in his role as a confused youth unable to resist the temptations of an adolescent life and later as the head of the family who takes care of his parents, wife, and children. The modern viewer can appreciate the life lessons witnessed in Cheran's Thavamai Thavamirundhu.  
These Girls
  The film takes place over a summer by the seaside and follows three girls through a summer that will change their lives. The story is told by Keira St. George ([[Caroline Dhavernas]]), a girl who is trying to decide what to do with her life. She constantly throws away her college letter without reading it, but her father always retrieves it, annoying her more. Her two best friends are Glory Lorraine ([[Amanda Walsh]]) a beautiful but somewhat bitchy girl obsessed with marriage, and Lisa MacDougall ([[Holly Lewis]]), an awkward, born-again, religious girl who is obsessed with sex.  Glory babysits for Keith Clark ([[David Boreanaz]]) and his wife, who works the night shift four times a week. Keith is a 32-year-old husband and father, who loves to ride his motorcycle, gamble with friends and smoke pot. One afternoon, Keira talks to Gordon Gruber ([[Donnell MacKenzie]]), who is a bit slow, trying to get information from him about Keith, who has taken Gruber under his wing. Gruber tells Keira about the pot growing in Keith's backyard. That night, Keira and Lisa decide to take some of Keith's pot. While leaving, they hear what sounds like Keith and his wife having sex. Sex crazed Lisa decides to take a closer look. When Kiera joins her, the two discover that Keith isn't with his wife but with Glory! Later that night, Glory arrives at the bonfire. Keira and Lisa tell Glory about seeing her with Keith. Glory defends her actions, saying she loves Keith and he loves her.  The next day, while Keira works at the food stand, Glory tells her more about Keith and her relationship with him. Wheels begin to turn in Keira's head, and after debating with herself, she decides to go to Keith's. He thinks she wants to buy pot, but she tells him she will "babysit" too. She convinces him to let her in. He tells her he's married and she's half his age, but it is obvious both are attracted to each other. She leads Keith into the bedroom.  The next day, Lisa arrives at the stand to tell Keira that she's going to sleep with Keith Clark. Keira tells Lisa that she's supposed to be religious and wait until she's married and that she will hurt Glory, but according to Lisa, since she hasn't been baptized yet, it's okay. She is concerned that when she marries, her virgin husband will not be satisfying. Not heeding Keira's repeated warnings, Lisa continues with her plan. When she arrives at Keith's house, he is in the garden. During their awkward conversation, in which Lisa makes it clear that she wants to "babysit" too, Glory arrives and is angry at Lisa and hostile to the others. While Keith tends to his crying daughter, Glory yells at Lisa for what she is doing. Eventually, Keith agrees to allow Lisa to babysit that night.  While babysitting, Lisa calls Keira to tell her she's at Keith's house. Keira begs her not to follow through with her plan, angering Lisa, who only wants Keira to come over and support. Keith arrives home and Lisa jumps him in an attempt to have sex, saying it's okay with Glory. Keith, obviously weirded out, eventually agrees to help Lisa lose her virginity. Keira and Glory arrive outside to watch through the bedroom window. While Keith and Lisa have awkward sex, outside, Keira admits to Glory that she also slept with Keith and Glory punches her, making her nose bleed. Glory is  furious and storms into the house and into the bedroom. An argument ensues between the girls and eventually all three leave.  Glory later refuses to talk to her best friends. She goes to Keith's house to discuss matters, but Keith rebukes her. Heartbroken and professing again that she loves him, Glory joins her friends in Keira's bedroom where Keira tells them about her plan. Keira and Lisa decide that since all three girls want Keith, then they should share him. Keira explains that with Sue, Keith's wife, working four night shifts, each girl could have him for a night and they could all "hang out" on the fourth night. Keith initially balks at the proposal but Keira threatens him with the fact that if people ''somehow'' find out: he will be considered a "pervert pothead who molests young girls". Keith reluctantly agrees.  The nightly sessions take a toll on Keith, who cannot stay awake anymore. He has performance problems and is upset that he has not been intimate with his wife and has a responsibility to his family. Keith becomes upset when the girls nearly tip off his wife and is hostile to the girls, but Keira restates her threat. Later, the girls are frightened when Lenny ([[Paul Spence]]), a biker friend of Keith's, arrives and begins to beat up Keith. As later revealed, Keith and Lenny plotted the attack to scare the girls, but it backfires when the girls take the baby and run. Keith is startled when he finds Gruber in the basement. Gruber tells Keith he has seen what Keith has been doing and that he knows about Keith and Lenny's plan. Keith is not intimidated.  When he realizes his daughter is missing, Keith freaks out and takes off to find her. At the dock, he grabs Lisa hard, screaming at her to tell him where his daughter is. Gruber attacks him from behind, knocking him out with a tire iron. Donny ([[Colin C. Berry]]) arrives at the scene and all five teens take Jasmine and the unconscious and bleeding Keith back home and debate whether to call 911. Keira hangs up the phone when Keith awakes but a colleague at the hospital tells Sue that there was a hang up call to 911 from her house. Sue leaves to investigate. Meanwhile, at the house, Glory again professes her love to Keith but he rejects her, saying she is crazy to think he would leave with her. She tells him that she's pregnant, which shocks everyone.  The teens disperse. Donny drives Glory, Gruber and Lisa home. As Glory sits crying, Donny holds her and comforts her. Keith's wife returns home, shocked at the mess and her husband's injury. Keith lies to her, telling her it was Lenny how injured him. She calls the police, which leads Lenny to punch him out. Lisa leaves for her religious boarding school where she still seems to be freaky. Donny and a pregnant Glory begin to date. Keira ends up going to college and knows she's going to enjoy it...  === Cast ===  *[[David Boreanaz]] as Keith Clark *[[Caroline Dhavernas]] as Keira St-George *[[Holly Lewis]] as Lisa MacDougall *[[Amanda Walsh]] as Glory Lorraine *[[Colin C.

In an altercation in a cinema theater, Kannappan gets murdered by a thug named Saniyan Sagadai ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]), who dominates South Chennai. Karpagam's husband told Sivagiri to leave Chennai if he wants his sister to be happy. Then, after Kannapan's funeral, he leaves his home town stating that he got a job in a cloth manufacturing company. But in reality, he comes with a mission in Chennai.  Then, he warns Sagadai stating that the latter too will be killed by him. He also calls ACP Raj Guru ([[Manoj K. Jayan]]) and warns him that he will kill all the dons of Chennai as the police department fails in their duty. Later on, Sivagiri's friend Veluchamy ([[Yugendran]]) who is a police inspector, comes to know about this. Sivagiri challenges Veluchamy that he will give up his mission if the latter keeps any one thug of Chennai in jail at least for a single day. Veluchamy not only fails in his mission but also loses his son as he was killed by Pattasu Balu, the head of the thug who got arrested.  This harsh lesson makes Veluchamy help Sivagiri. Thus, Veluchamy lists Sivagiri the entire mafia network of Chennai by providing the specification of who leads the various areas.

Then one day, Subha meets Sivagiri in a temple and finds that he is not working in any cloth manufacturing company. But still, Sivagiri manages to make Subha believe that he is working in a travels company. Thus, Subha gets a promise from Sivagiri that he should meet her and spend time with her quite frequently.  Later on, Sivagiri provokes Ravi to kill his own brother ([[Sashikumar Subramani|Sashikumar]]) by sticking the funeral posters of Ravi and making him think that his brother is the person who is killing people all over Chennai. After the death of Ravi's brother, when a lemon fells on his head, Ravi realizes his brother is not the one who stick funeral poster, so he hides himself in a politician's house to be away and safe from the hands of Sivagiri. That politician damages his own car and house and makes the police to believe that someone has attacked his house. Thus, the police decide to provide security for the politician. This makes Ravi feel happy, considering that Sivagiri can't come to his place by fooling all these inspectors and kill him. Then Veluchamy found out that Ravi is hiding in the politician's place. (He found out from the politician's servant that walks in but brings tobacco).  Sivagiri wants Veluchamy to help by disbanding the police protection, but Veluchamy refused because that is the police's responsibilities to protect. He can only inform Sivagiri and Sivagiri has to kill Ravi. Later on, Sivagiri brings a group of people, who rallies due losing their money to a financier, that the fraud financier is hiding in the politician's place. With the rally, Sivagiri enters Ravi's fort and succeeds in killing Ravi by using mosquito pesticide into his mouth. Raj inquires the people that involve in rally regarding identity of Sivagiri. However nobody want to tell anything because they think Sivagiri is doing the police's job while the police do nothing and only waits for their salary. Even Raj's daughter is willing to die than reveal Sivagiri's identity because she was rescued by Sivagiri from Pattasu Balu.  Later on, Sivagiri decides to kill Sagadai, and as usual warns him. This makes Sagadai seek the protection of a mass group of thugs from Chennai. Sivagiri uses this as a chance to destroy the entire mafia gang of Chennai. Thus, Sivagiri ignites a war between the police group and mafia gang in a very diplomatic manner. Sivagiri disguises himself as a police inspector and enters Sagadai's fort. Veluchamy too helps Sivagiri in his mission by hurting himself. Raj angrily orders his squad to hit the thugs.

Three Dollars
 The film and book tell the story of Eddie ([[David Wenham]]), a principled man with a seemingly stable and happy life. He has a wife, the academic Tanya ([[Frances O'Connor]]), a daughter, Abby (Joanna Hunt-Prokhovnik), is paying off a house and has a job as a government land assessor. Yet when the forces of economic and social change threaten this, he realises just how fragile his reality and security is. After losing his job, he checks his bank balance and realises he has only the 'three dollars' of the title to his name.  Eddie's life also becomes entwined with that of childhood friend Amanda ([[Sarah Wynter]]), whom he unfailingly runs into every nine-and-a-half years, and every time he has just three dollars.  The novel and film are set largely in [[Melbourne]], at a time when the policies of economic liberalisation were gaining credence in Australian politics and were arguably affecting many lives similarly to Eddie and Tanya. They explore the choices we make between what we have and what might be.  
The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada
 Melquiades Estrada , a Mexican [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrant]] working in Texas as a cowboy, shoots at a [[coyote]] which is menacing his small flock of goats. A nearby [[United States Border Patrol]] officer, Norton, thinks he is being attacked and shoots back, killing Melquiades. Norton quickly buries Melquiades and does not report anything. Melquiades' body is found and is reburied in a local cemetery by the sheriff's office. Evidence that he may have been killed by the [[U.S. Border Patrol]] is ignored by the local sheriff, Belmont, who would prefer to avoid trouble with the Border Patrol.  Pete Perkins, a rancher and Melquiades' best friend, finds out from a waitress, Rachel, that the killer was Norton. Perkins kidnaps Norton after tying up his wife, Lou Ann, ([[January Jones]]) , gags her mouth with duct tape and forces him to dig up Melquiades' body. Perkins had promised Melquiades that he would bury him in his home town of JimÃ©nez in Mexico if he died in Texas. Perkins undertakes a journey on horseback into Mexico with the body tied to a mule and his captive Norton in tow. It is clear to Sheriff Belmont that Perkins has kidnapped Norton, and so police officers and the Border Patrol begin to search for them. Belmont sees them heading towards the Mexico border, but as he takes aim at Perkins, he can't bring himself to shoot and returns to town, leaving the pursuit to the border patrol.  On their way across the harsh countryside, the pair experience a series of surrealistic encounters. They spend an afternoon with an elderly blind American man ([[Levon Helm]]), who listens to Mexican radio for company. The man asks to be shot since there is no one left to take care of him. He does not want to commit suicide because, he argues, doing so would offend God. Perkins refuses as, if he killed the man, ''he'' would offend God. Norton attempts to escape and is bitten by a rattlesnake and eventually discovered by a group of illegal immigrants crossing into Texas. Perkins gives one of them a horse as barter payment for guiding them across the river to an herbal healer. She turns out to be a woman whose nose Norton had broken when he punched her in the face a few weeks previously during an arrest. At Perkins's request, she saves Norton's life before exacting her revenge by breaking Norton's nose with a coffee pot.  The captivity, the tiring journey, and the rotting corpse slowly take a profound psychological toll on Norton. At one point the duo encounter a group of Mexican [[cowboy]]s watching American soap operas on a television hooked up to their pickup truck. The program is the same episode that was airing when Norton had sex with his wife in their trailer earlier in the movie. Norton is visibly shaken and is given half a bottle of liquor by one of the cowboys. Norton's wife is shown as she decides to leave the border town to return to her home town of Cincinnati. She has grown distant from her husband and seems unconcerned about his kidnapping, stating that he is "beyond redemption".  Perkins and Norton then arrive at a town that is supposed to be near JimÃ©nezâthe town Melquiades Estrada claimed was his home. No one in the town has heard of JimÃ©nez. Perkins has some luck in locating a woman Melquiades indicated was his wife but, when Perkins confronts her, she states that she has never heard of Melquiades Estrada and lives in town with her husband and children. She does visibly react to Estrada's Polaroid photograph Perkins shows her of Melquiades standing behind her and her children, stating that she does "...not want to get in trouble with her husband". Perkins continues onward searching for Melquiades' descriptions of a place "filled with beauty". Eventually they come upon a ruined house which Perkins feels was the one Melquiades had mentioned. Perkins and Norton repair the walls, construct a new roof and bury Estrada for the third and final time.  Perkins then demands that Norton beg forgiveness for the killing, but Norton responds with obstinacy. Perkins fires several shots from his pistol around Norton until he breaks down and relents, begging forgiveness from Melquiades. Perkins accepts his outpouring of grief and leaves Norton a horse, and in passing calls him "son". As Perkins rides away, Norton calls out and asks him if he will be okay, suggesting that Norton may have found the redemption his wife had felt he was incapable of having.

He lies to her about where he is going and heads to his building to complete the deal to hopefully get himself rich.  Under heavy levels of stress, Tom shouts at the kind old security guard, Eddie, before going into the building. At midnight, Tom goes five levels down in the building's underground [[parking garage]] to E-6.

Frightened, the woman maces him and flees. Armed with only a tire iron, Tom goes into the bathroom to wash the pepper spray out of his eyes, and discovers that the driver has attached a hose to the truck's exhaust pipe, and Tom flees his only safe place, which is quickly filling up with deadly carbon monoxide gas. Tom goes to a nearby truck where the driver appears and tries to mow him down with their truck. He manages to get away from the truck by hiding behind a construction truck. He climbs on top of the construction truck and manages to climb on top of the truck, where he discovers the dead body of the woman who had earlier maced him.  The truck's driver is willing to kill anybody who gets in the way of their goal.

The driver realizes that Tom is on top of the car and bucks him into another car, before ramming it into the wall. Tom manages to flee and discover a repo man who also sees him as a threat, since he is really a carjacker. The repo man attempts to attack him, but he is thrown onto construction equipment and is impaled on nails. Tom believes the man is the driver, but he was actually the only man who could help him. The carjacker shoots his pistol empty and attempts to tell Tom how he can start the car but he dies before he can get the information out.

Tideland (film)
 ''Tideland'' centers on an abandoned child, Jeliza-Rose, and her solitary adventures during one summer in rural  [[Texas]] while staying at a rundown farmhouse called What Rocks, and focuses on the increasingly dark, imaginative [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] life the girl creates with the aid of dismembered [[Barbie doll]] heads that she often wears on her fingertips. With names such as Mystique, Sateen Lips, Baby Blonde and Glitter Gal, the doll heads not only engage in long conversations with Jeliza-Rose, reflecting different aspects of the girl's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], but also act as her companions while she explores the barren Texas landscape.  After her mother chokes to death, Jeliza-Rose and her father, Noah, flee to Noah's mother's home, a remote Texas farmhouse. Noah fears that with all the drugs in their house he will lose Jeliza-Rose and be sent to prison, so he attempts to set it alight before they leave, although Jeliza-Rose manages to stop him. They find the farmhouse abandoned, but they settle in anyway. Their first night there, Noah dies from a [[heroin]] overdose. For much of the rest of the film, Noah's corpse remains seated upright in a living room chair with sunglasses covering his eyes. As her father slowly begins to decompose, Jeliza-Rose doesn't readily acknowledge his death because she has grown accustomed to him being unconscious for long periods at a time. Instead, she retreats deeper and deeper into her own mind, exploring the tall grass around the farmhouse, relying on her doll heads for friendship as an unconscious way of keeping herself from feeling too lonely and afraid.  During Jeliza-Rose's wanderings, she eventually encounters and befriends her neighbors, a [[Mental retardation|mentally impaired]] young man called Dickens and his older sister Dell who is blind in one eye from a bee sting. At this point the story begins to unfold, revealing a past connection between Dell and Jeliza-Rose's deceased father. The eccentric neighbors take the girl under their wing, going so far as to preserve Noah's body via [[taxidermy]] (which Dell and Dickens did to their own dead mother). Amorous feelings, initiated mostly by the much younger Jeliza-Rose, begin to creep into the childlike relationship between her and Dickens, and it is revealed that the deeply troubled Dickens, a man-child who once drove a school bus in front of an oncoming train, keeps a stash of dynamite in his bedroom that he intends to use against the "Monster Shark" he believes is roaming the countryside. The Monster Shark is, in reality, the nightly passenger train that travels past the farmhouse where Jeliza-Rose and her dead father reside.  At the end of the film, following a violent confrontation between Dell, Dickens and Jeliza-Rose, a [[train wreck]] is caused by Dickens' dynamite, creating a scene of chaos near the farmhouse.  Wandering about the wreckage, and among the confusion of injured travelers, Jeliza-Rose is discovered by a woman who survived, and she assumes the little girl is also a victim of the train wreck. The film ends with the woman embracing Jeliza-Rose, who stares with stunned confusion at the wreckage.  
The Tiger and the Snow
 [[Rome]], March 2003. Attilio de Giovanni ([[Roberto Benigni]]), a comical but talented [[literature]] [[professor]] and the divorced father of two teenage girls, is hopelessly in love with Vittoria ([[Nicoletta Braschi]], Benigni's wife in real life), a writer who is the subject of a recurring dream, featuring a surreal wedding ceremony with poetry verses in the background and the wife suddenly turning into a [[kangaroo]]. Attilio's strenuous courtship is unsuccessful, yet he does not lose hope, despite the fact that Vittoria obviously does not share the same feelings. She tells him that she will agree to marry him only when she sees a [[tiger]] walking on the snow.  Vittoria leaves to go to [[Iraq]] to write the biography of the poet Fuad ([[Jean Reno]]), a close friend of Attilio who is returning to his country after 18 years in exile in [[France]]. Vittoria is wounded during the [[Iraq War]] and Attilio manages to reach [[Baghdad]] with the intention of saving her life. He finds Vittoria in an Iraqi hospital lying in a [[coma]]; like thousands of Iraqis, she is in danger of dying from lack of [[medicine]]. Fuad directs Attilio to an old Iraqi [[pharmacist]], who suggests ancient treatments that keep her alive. Attilio locates [[scuba set|scuba]] gear (to provide oxygen) and even "a weapon of mass destruction" (a flyswatter),<ref>https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4966584</ref> one example of the film's anti-war stance.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/oct/05/features</ref>  Attilio then runs the risk of going to the Italian Red Cross HQ in Iraq, obtains medical supplies by posing as a doctor, then brings medicines back to Baghdad. The medical supplies enable Vittoria to make a complete recovery, but when Attilio goes to Fuad's house to tell him about this triumph over adversity, he finds that Fuad has hanged himself. Fuad had earlier had a short soliloquy on how "his eyes no longer...", but Attilio had not picked up on because he was frantically trying to make the [[glycerine]] mixture to save Vittoria. Just before Vittoria emerges from her coma, Attilio is captured by the [[U.S. Military]] and is mistaken for an Iraqi [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|insurgent]], but he is nevertheless freed and able to return to Italy.  In the final scenes it is revealed that Vittoria is Attilio's ex-wife. They are separated in this story, perhaps because of his tumultuous over-abundant energy and insane diversions, (along with earlier transgressions with another woman). Several times we see Attilio in awkward visits to Vittoria and their children, and obviously he is still hopelessly in love. (He proved this in the most extreme way- finding her and somehow managing to save her life in war-torn Iraq.) On the same day Attilio returns to his country, there is an animal breakout at the Rome zoo. Vittoria, driving her car, stops to see an escaped tiger in the middle of the road under falling, snow-like pollen from the jasmine trees. In the final scene of the film, even though Attilio won't admit that he is the "wonderful stranger who saved her", Vittoria suddenly recognizes his familiar way of kissing her forehead in the same manner that "the stranger" had kissed her when she was lying unconscious in the hospital, and the way her necklace (that he took from her in Iraq, for safekeeping) dangling from his neck touches her face.  
Thumbsucker (film)
 Justin Cobb is a shy 17-year-old in a family of four in suburban [[Oregon]]. He has a persistent thumb-sucking habit his father disapproves of, which has led to major [[orthodontic]] repair. He addresses his parents by their first names, Mike and Audrey, so as not to make his father feel old. Audrey, a [[registered nurse]], is idly fascinated by actor Matt Schramm, entering a contest to win a date with him. She insists it is "innocent fun", but is inordinately concerned with looking attractive for the contest.  Justin struggles on his school's [[debate team]], led by Mr. Geary which he joined to get closer to his environmentalist classmate Rebecca. He tries to start a relationship with her, but she rejects him after he cannot open up to her about his thumb-sucking habit.  At a regular checkup, Justin's orthodontist, Dr. Perry Lyman, indicates he can tell that Justin is still sucking his thumb, and attempts [[hypnosis]], coaching Justin to find his [[power animal]] (a deer) and [[Post-hypnotic suggestion|suggesting]] that his thumb will taste like [[echinacea]]. This works, and Justin finds his thumb distasteful, but falls deeper into frustration without the crutch. After Justin conspires with his brother to disrupt Dr. Lyman in a bicycle race with Justin's father, his school counselor prods the Cobbs to give him [[Ritalin]]. While his parents wring their hands over the idea, Justin insists that he needs the help.  Almost immediately after beginning treatment, Justin begins to have elevated energy, confidence and focus. He begins to excel on the debate team, unseating Rebecca from the star position; she quits the team and drifts into the [[Drug culture|stoners]] crowd. Justin's newfound aggressiveness nets the debate team repeated awards. Simultaneously, he begins to challenge the [[Neurosis|neuroses]] of the adults around him, especially their struggles with aging. With a somewhat deceitful cover letter, he applies to [[New York University|NYU]], in spite of his mother's urging that he go to college closer to home.  After rambling incoherently at the state debate championship, Justin quits the debate team, throws away the pills, and seeks out Rebecca to hook him up with [[Cannabis (drug)|pot]]. During their smoking sessions, Rebecca blindfolds him and engages with him in kissing and other sexual activity, which Justin interprets as a relationship. But when he broaches the subject, Rebecca tells him otherwise, calling their meetings an "experiment." He quits both her and the drugs.  Both Justin and his father suspect that Audrey is having an affair with Schramm after she is transferred to a celebrity [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] facility where Schramm has been committed. Attempting to catch his mother in the act, he instead meets Schramm sneaking a smoke in the bushes, and learns the unromantic truth. The next day, he receives an acceptance letter from NYU.  During a final checkup, Dr. Lyman reveals to Justin his discovery that thumb-sucking is not a medically debilitating problem, and says that everyone has their own flaws and nobody has all the answers&mdash;that in fact learning to live without having the answers is (perhaps) the answer. On his flight to New York, Justin dreams of reaching his goal of being a TV anchor, "sharing the truth with the world". He wakes up after [[Somniloquy|sleeptalking]] to find his thumb in his mouth and an attractive girl smiling at him. Slightly embarrassed but self-confident, he introduces himself.

Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger vs. Abaranger
 Responding to a local disturbance, the Dekarangers apprehend Abared, Abare Blue and Abare Yellow, who were in the middle of chasing a raven. After interrogating the three Abarangers, the Dekarangers are ordered to bring them to the Deka Room, where they are all briefed on the shape-shifting Ginjifuan Kazak. The Abarangers explain that they were contacted by a curry shop owner friend of theirs who is being targeted by Kazak; hence their short battle with Kazak, who changed into a raven and fled while the Abarangers were arrested. Despite Doggie Kruger's suggestion to investigate the curry shop, both Super Sentai groups get into a heated argument over their methods of justice. However, when Yukito discovers a weak spot on Doggie's back and uses his chiropractic skills to fix it, Doggie suggests for Ban to team up with Ryoga.  Meanwhile, at a meeting with Kazak, Agent Abrella breaks open a red orb to unleash Trinoid #0 Saunaginnan, who had been sealed away by [[Invasion's Garden Evolien#Mikela|Mikela]] as he was deemed too powerful. Saunaginnan demonstrates his power by reviving the previously deleted Reversian Succubus and Speckionian Genio. However, Saunaginnan quickly wears out his energy, as he is missing two gingko nut batteries that power his abilities. Kazak takes the two revived Alienizers to retrieve the gingko nuts, giving each of them a piece of the shattered orb.  Ban and Ryoga arrive at Dino House, which has grown to become the country's largest curry shop. There, they meet the Trinoid Yatsudenwani, who has replaced Mr. Sugishita as the president of the restaurant chain. He explains to the duo that he had kept the orb that contained Saunaginnan when it was stolen, but he reveals that he has the two gingko nuts. Kazak suddenly appears and attacks Yatsudenwani before Deka Red and Aba Red interfere. However, during the fight, the clock strikes 11:00 and Aba Red suddenly leaves the fight to make a phone call to his niece Mai, who is currently taking up acting classes in Hollywood. This causes Kazak to defeat the two warriors and leave with the gingko nuts, announcing his plans to resurrect all of the deleted Alienizers and [[Invasion's Garden Evolien#Dezumozorlya|Dezumozorlya]]. Meanwhile, Succubus and Genio wreak havoc in two different places in town. Deka Blue, Deka Green and Deka Break assume they can easily defeat Genio by hitting his chest, but to no effect. Abare Blue pinpoints a weakness in his third vertebra, enabling the four warriors to once again delete him. Jasmine, Umeko and Ranru prepare to battle Succubus, but the Alienizer spits out a gel that clogs up their transformation devices. After distracting Succubus with some cosplaying tactics, Ranru finds a formula to dissolve the gel, enabling all three to transform and defeat Succubus. Both Genio and Succubus are reduced to the orb chunks that were in their possession. Deka Red and Aba Red once again face Kazak, but they both end up fighting each other over Aba Red's phone call. While Kazak's platoon of Anaroids massage him, Aba Red explains to Deka Red that he made a promise to call Mai before her audition. This gives Kazak the opportunity to throw both red warriors off the building. However, some last-minute teamwork brings them both back in the fight, which is suddenly interrupted by Asuka playing his harmonica. Enraged by the presence of evil on Another Earth, Abare Black attacks Kazak, who is then forced to retreat into the orb chunk he carries.  Meanwhile, at a cave, Saunaginnan becomes fully charged, causing the orb chunks to glow into a trail while Earth becomes engulfed in a thick fog. The Dekarangers and Abarangers follow the trail, but are confronted by Kazak and Saunaginnan, with the revived Ben-G, Milibar and Bon-Goblin and an army of Anaroids. Kazak sends the heroes in confusion by shape-shifting into [[Special Police Dekaranger#Numa-O|Numa-O]] and [[Ninpuu Sentai Hurricaneger#Hurricanegers|Hurricane Red]]. The fog gets thicker as the door to hell opens in the sky, but as everyone anticipates the arrival of Dezumozorlya, Mikoto Nakadai and TopGaler come out instead. After Doggie enters the fight, both Dekarangers and Abarangers shuffle members to defeat the revived Alienizers. The heroes then use the D-Bazooka and Superior Dino Bomber to delete Kazak and Saunaginnan. Kazak, however, dodges the blast and boards his Heavy Industrial Machine PalletteView while Saunaginnan is resurrected into a giant. Super Dekaranger Robo and Killer AbarenOh destroy the two giants with a combined Gatling Punch and Gatling Drill Spin attack. As a side-effect of defeating Saunaginnan, Mikoto must return to the afterlife, but not before telling Asuka to give his regards to his daughter.  Back at Deka Base, the Dekarangers and Abarangers celebrate their victory with a party hosted by Yatsudenwani, who irritates the Dekarangers with his singing. It is later on revealed that Doggie was one of Dino House's regular customers. Meanwhile, the girls and Emiri enjoy a bubble bath before Yatsudenwani barges in. They chase him around the Deka Room before everyone stops to have a group photo taken.

Tom-Yum-Goong
 Kham is the last of a family line of guards who once watched over the [[Chakri Dynasty|King of Thailand]]'s [[war elephant]]s. Traditionally, only the most perfect elephants could successfully defend the throne, and very great care was taken in raising them. Kham grows up forming close relations to his elephant, Por Yai and his calf, Kohrn. During [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]] festival, the elephants are stolen with help from Mr. Suthep, a local [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and his son who are collaborating with elephant poachers. Kham discovers that they are in the hands of Johnny, a Vietnamese gangster who runs a Thai restaurant named Tom Yum Goong Otob in Sydney, Australia.  Kham arrives in Sydney, and is stalked by the police as soon as he leaves the airport. Kham coerces a gangster to lead him to Johnny's hideout, interrupting a drug deal. Outraged, Johnny summons countless [[extreme sports]] enthusiasts, who arrive to fight Kham.  Exhausted, Kham falls asleep in an alley. A prostitute brings him to her apartment. In his sleep, he dreams of an epic battle involving war elephants and the Jaturangkabart, the elephant protectors. When Pla leaves, Kham wakes up to the sound of police sirens and must escape.  Two officers, Mark and Rick are taken off the case and reassigned to provide security for the Police Commissioner's meeting with Mr. Sim. In that meeting, Pla acted as a hostess girl to the two men. During the meeting, Mr. Sim and the Commissioner are murdered. The murder is instigated by Vincent, who kills Rick and puts the blame on Mark. Mark escapes, but is later captured.  With Pla's help, Kham enters Tom Yum Goong Otob. He fights his way into the VIP area and reaches the dining hall at the top. Kham demands, "Where are my elephants?" and is met with the laughter of Johnny and his men. Johnny taunts Kham with Kohrn's bell. This enrages Kham and he fights and defeats his opponents. He enters the storage area, containing various exotic animals ready to be butchered and eaten. Kham finds and frees Mark and Kohrn, escaping minutes before the police arrive. Meanwhile, Madame Rose is made the new leader of the Chinese gang after she murders two other possible successors.  Inspector Vincent initiates a search for Kham and Mark, who are hiding in a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastery. Soon after their departure, the monastery is set on fire. But then Kham returns, and he defeats a fierce [[capoeira|capoerista]] and a sword-wielding [[Wushu (sport)|wushu]] expert. However, his third opponent, a giant wrestler, proves way too much for Kham. When the police arrive, he flees with Mark. By morning, Kham goes on his way. Mark is discovered by several policemen and sent to deal with Inspector Vincent, whom Pla has revealed to be the murderer.  Kham arrives at a conference hall where Madame Rose is having a press conference. Kohrn runs in, scaring off everyone while Kham engages the gangsters. He later finds Kohrn in an elevator lobby, where Vincent threatens to shoot him.  Kham finds himself with Kohrn in a huge room, and he is shown the skeleton of Por Yai, encrusted with jewels as a gift to Madame Rose. Her men then attack Kham, and he attacks them more brutally than previously seen, by breaking many of the men's arms and legs. The wrestler from the monastery is called in, along with three others. Kohrn is thrown through a glass wall, and Kham is knocked into the elephant ornament, causing two leg bones to fall off. Kham ties them around his arms and uses them as clubs to knock the wrestlers out. He stops Madame Rose before she can escape in a [[helicopter]], and crashed.  Back in the lobby, Mark is shown Pla, and forgiven by his boss, Inspector Lamond. He is given a new partner who speaks Thai. Mark is then interviewed by a reporter about Kham. Finally, a narration from Mark is heard, with scenes of Kham's childhood shown. Mark explains that [[Thai people]] treat elephants like they are their brothers, and they hate people who hurt them. [[Thai National Anthem|Thais love peace, but dislike people who take liberties.]] Kham is finally reunited with Kohrn.  
Tom and Jerry: The Fast and the Furry
  [[Tom Cat|Tom]] and [[Jerry Mouse|Jerry]] have wrecked the house they lived in, so they enter a race/[[reality show]] titled the "Fabulous Super Race", which offers the race-winner a luxurious mansion. Tom and Jerry, having built their own customized vehicles from junk yard materials, soon meet the contestants, including Dr. Professor who is eliminated before the race starts, because he and his vehicle are vaporized by [[antimatter]] used to power the vehicle.  The racers begin the race in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], where Grammy takes an early lead, but is overtaken by Steed late in the leg. The racers are stopped by a highway traffic jam so they need to find a way to pass over it. Soccer Mom, who finds that there's no way to get over it, plays some music. The race was initially going to be from Hollywood to [[Mexico]], but due to public ratings of the event, J.W. decides to extend the race to the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian jungle]]. During the leg, Tom switches a sign, causing contestant Soccer Mom to drive her car into a pit of quicksand. Steed, still in the lead, crosses an old bridge but leaves a hole in the middle, causing problems for Grammy and Gorthan. Tom crosses the bridge easily, then attempts to destroy the bridge in the hope of eliminating Jerry, but it backfires and causes Tom to fall into the water. Steed once again wins, with Grammy following in second, but J.W. wants to continue the race due to the high ratings. When the studio head changes the race again, the hosts, Biff and Buzz, announce that the next leg of the race is set in [[Antarctica]], and the remaining drivers will have to modify their cars for ocean travel.  On the way to the South Pole, Steed's car breaks down and he encounters what he thinks is a mermaid on an island who, in turn, proceeds to feed him to her ravenous offspring. The first contestant to reach the destination grounds is Gorthan, who is then eliminated when, after being goaded into touching his tongue to a metal pole by the hosts, he causes himself and his car to float away on an iceberg.  Before the start of the next leg of the race, Tom, Jerry and Grammy arrive on the scene. As the remaining racers modify their cars, Grammy is apparently eliminated when she and her dog Squirty are swallowed by a whale thanks to Tom's machinations. During the Antarctic leg, Tom and Jerry race each other across Antarctica. Tom is frozen into an ice block and slides all around Antarctica, which nearly causes his elimination when his car reaches the finish line before he does. Meanwhile, in the production office, J.W. is notified that the ratings of the race are up and need to be kept up. The hosts are then notified that the racers will have to modify their cars again to race underwater to [[Australia]]. Tom faces several problems, including his car being taken over by seals, his fish juice spray attracting sharks, which ends in his elimination when he crashes into a concrete block and his car is destroyed by an anchor.  Jerry arrives and gestures to the hosts that he has not seen Tom, who is then assumed dead. Jerry then continues racing across Australia to [[Borneo]], where the finish line has been reassigned to. Grammy returns to the race when the whale that swallowed her and Squirty spits them out. Tom also returns to the race when Irving flies to Australia to administer [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] under J.W.'s orders, because his antagonistic nature gave the race great ratings. Tom then repairs his car and cuts the continent in half using a laser in an attempt to simultaneously get into first place and get rid of Jerry, Grammy and Squirty. A boxing kangaroo attacks Tom in revenge for the destruction while the others escape.  The next leg of the race involves them modifying their cars with balloons for air travel to [[Borneo]]. After Tom pops Grammy's balloons, Grammy and Squirty fall to their deaths bickering over what they assume was a parachute. After Tom's own balloons pop, he crashlands into a vacationing Spike who then tries to attack him but is knocked out by his own car, and then gives pursuit after Jerry and the finish line. Meanwhile, in the production office, J.W. announces that the true final leg of the race is back to Hollywood, which will involve them travelling around the world back to the finishing point with high speed jets in only five minutes due to the race taking too long. Tom and Jerry are shocked at this latest last-minute change, but go ahead and race through several major locations in Asia, Europe, the Atlantic and the US, causing massive destruction to numerous monuments in their wake in many comical ways - shrinking [[Mount Everest]], turning the [[Taj Mahal]] into a spinning top, playing Pinball on [[St Basil's Cathedral]], straightening the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]], turning the [[Eiffel Tower]] into a pretzel, turning [[Big Ben]] into a broken cuckoo clock, destroying the [[Great Wall of China]], the [[Roman Coliseum]], and [[Stonehenge]], turning a castle into a trailer park, removing a Scotsman's quilt, stripping the [[Statue of Liberty]], sealing the [[Grand Canyon]], removing the letters of the [[Hollywood sign]] (aside from "ow"), and turning the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] into a bunch of [[shuriken]]. At the finish line, Tom and Jerry's jet planes break down causing them to tie on the line.  Although they both win because of the tie, J.W. says according to the contract, since they tied, they have to do the race all over again. Tom and Jerry proceed to attack J.W. in retaliation, then seize the key to the mansion from him. J.W., angry and disoriented, decides that Hollywood stands for family entertainment, whereupon the pharaoh-like President of Hollywood appears to incinerate J.W. for his inappropriate change of heart, and makes Irving the new producer and head of Glouwobbler Studios. Meanwhile, Tom and Jerry share their new mansion peacefully, until Tom's previous owner shows up and pretends like she owns the house, demanding Tom dispose of Jerry.

They need to get 300.000 Euros to get Bennie's father a new liver.

Accessed February 28, 2013.</ref> |}  Each chapter follows a storyline that continues throughout the series. Kelly voices the role of the song's [[protagonist]], Sylvester, who wakes up after a [[one-night stand]] with a woman. As he prepares to leave, however, the woman's husband returns and Sylvester is forced to hide in a closet. This sets off an escalating series of events.  [[File:Trapped in the Closet.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of the ''Trapped in the Closet'' DVD, containing the videos for the first twelve chapters of the series.]]  ===Video synopsis===  ;Chapter 1  Sylvester wakes up in bed with a woman who is not his wife. As he prepares to leave, the woman tells him her husband is coming up the stairs and tells Sylvester to hide in the closet. The couple begins making love when Sylvester's cell phone rings, prompting the husband to investigate. After searching elsewhere, he slowly approaches the closet. Sylvester, prepared for a confrontation, takes out his [[Beretta|"Beretta" pistol]]. However, the pistol he reveals is actually a [[M1911 pistol|1911 pistol]].  : ''Ending [[cliffhanger]] line: "Now he's opening the closet...."  ;Chapter 2 Having discovered Sylvester in his wife's closet, the husband nearly attacks him but stops because Sylvester is armed. He tells Sylvester that he is a [[pastor]] and not prone to violence. When Sylvester tries to leave, the husband tells him to stay because he wants to reveal a "secret". He then calls someone he calls "baby" and says to "turn the car around". Sylvester is anxious about what the husband is about to reveal and becomes threatening, but then someone knocks on the door. The husband opens the door and the person turns out to be another manârevealing the husband (Rufus) to be [[bisexual]].  : ''Ending cliffhanger line: "I can't believe it's a man....."  ;Chapter 3 A shocked and confused Sylvester prepares to leave but the wife asks him to stay. She then argues with her husband, Rufus, over his own infidelity. When Sylvester demands more explanation, the other man, Chuck, begins explaining how their affair came about. Rufus calls his wife Cathy, which shocks Sylvester, who thought her name was Mary. Rufus, Cathy, and Chuck all begin yelling at each other, prompting Sylvester to shoot his gun in the air to quiet them. Sylvester then calls home but is stunned when another man answers the phone. He quickly bolts out of the apartment.  : ''Ending cliffhanger line: "Call up my home and a man picks up the phone...."''  ;Chapter 4 Sylvester is seen rushing home, angered and belligerent, but is pulled over by a police officer, who gives him a ticket for speeding. He breaks in his own back door and surprises his wife in the shower only to find her alone. She reminds Sylvester that her brother Twan was coming home from prison that day, and he answered the phone. Sylvester apologizes, and they begin making love. In the middle of it, however, Sylvester's wife, Gwendolyn, discreetly covers something on the bed and then jumps on top of Sylvester and begins to go wild. When Gwendolyn finally climaxes and rolls off him, Sylvester flips the bed cover to find the used condom that she had tried to hide.  : ''Ending cliffhanger line:  "Oh, my God, a rubber!"''  The video for chapter four has since been revised to better match chapter five. The original actor for the officer AKA James, Rondolo Bryce, was changed to current actor, Michael Kenneth Williams. And the line "I said 'This is some bullshit!', as he gave me the ticket" was changed to "He flicked his cigarette and then gives me the ticket."  ;Chapter 5 Chapter five starts with Sylvester demanding answers about the condom. They argue, and Gwendolyn retorts with her own knowledge of Sylvester's infidelity, saying she saw Sylvester in the club the night before. He ignores that and demands she name names. She begins talking about friends of hers named Tina and Roxanne and also mentions Chuck and Rufus, which confuses Sylvester. She then explains that she and Cathy were friends in high school, and it was Cathy who introduced Gwendolyn to the police officer that stopped Sylvester, confirming that the police officer was her secret lover.  : ''Ending cliffhanger line: "She introduced me to the policeman that stopped you."''  ;Chapter 6 Sylvester and Gwendolyn begin laughing at the entire situation. She admits that the cop she slept with is really the one who answered the phone. And he explains the events of earlier in the morning. Meanwhile, the cop-lover turns his car back around, concerned for Gwendolyn's safety. He sees the back door broken in and mistakes the laughter for [[domestic violence|abuse]] and bursts into the bedroom, gun drawn. Sylvester pulls his gun on the cop, whose name is revealed to be James. Gwendolyn pleads with Sylvester, and he puts his gun down. But then James winks and smiles, and Sylvester rushes him. They wrestle over the gun, which inadvertently discharges.  : ''Ending cliffhanger line: "Goin' all around the room, both hands on the gun, then all of a sudden, pow."''  ;Chapter 7 This chapter reveals it was Twan, Gwendolyn's brother who was just released from prison, who was the one who was shot. After realizing who it was, Sylvester and James argue at who was at fault with the shooting, with Sylvester blaming the entire incident on the cop. Twan is presumed to be dead, but in the middle of Sylvester, James and Gwendolyn arguing, Twan coughs, assuring them he is okay and that he was only non-fatally shot in the shoulder. As Twan recovers in the bathroom, Sylvester begins telling him what caused the incident when someone knocks on the door. After being hesitant with answering the door, Sylvester grabs his gun and aims it at the door, Twan joins him, snatching James' gun. At the count of three, Twan opens the door and it is revealed to be the next door neighbor, Rosie, who is shown with a spatula in her hand. A relieved Sylvester and Gwendolyn invite Rosie in while James snatches his gun back from a bewildered Twan's hands and leaves.  : ''Ending cliffhanger-outro line: "...With a spatula in her hand...like that's gon' do something against them guns, it's Rosie, the nosy neighbor."''  ;Chapter 8 In this chapter, a tired and frustrated James drives back to his house and calls up his wife Bridget (Kelly sings all of Bridget's lines with a [[Southern American English|Southern accent]]). James tells a concerned Bridget that he was heading home, to which Bridget happily tells him she had baked him a cherry pie. Meanwhile, at Sylvester's house, Rosie, the next door neighbor, tells Sylvester, Twan and Gwendolyn that she could not stand the cop that just left their house causing Gwendolyn, Sylvester and Twan to laugh. Back at James' house, he pulls up to the garage. A panicked Bridget rushes to the door and kisses James. When James asks her why she looked jittery, Bridget excuses it as "might be [[Menstrual cycle|that time of the month]]". The "might be" makes James suspicious. Bridget laughs it off, saying "you know what I mean". When Bridget tries getting him upstairs for pears, James insists on heating some leftover chicken. Bridget's nervous breakdown finally leads to James demanding a straight answer from Bridget. James then starts to wonder if Bridget had also cheated on him. Unbeknownst to him and from the looks of a nervous Bridget, it becomes clear another man is still in the house.  :''Ending cliffhanger line: "But little does he know that somebody is still right there in his home!"''  ;Chapter 9 James starts investigating his house for any possible intruders. When he hears a noise, he begins to search all over the kitchen while a panicked Bridget stands over by the dishes. After James checks the oven and looks behind the fridge, he notices the cherry pie with a slice cut out. When he realizes that Bridget is [[Food allergy|allergic to cherries]], he turns to her and moves slowly to a scared Bridget. After demanding Bridget to move from her spot, which she eventually does, he sees the cabinet and slowly approaches it. Just as he opens it, the video suddenly stops and the narrator exits out of a closet and, [[Fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]], tells the audience that the man, hiding in the cabinet, is a [[midget]].  : ''Ending un-cliffhanger line: "Now, pause the movie, âcause what I'm about to say to y'all is so damn twistedânot only is there a man in his cabinet, but the man is a midget! Midget! Midget! Midget!"''  ;Chapter 10 In this chapter, the midget jumps out of the cabinet and fights with James. After James' constant roughing up on the midget, Bridget runs upstairs where she pulls out a number from her purse. Meanwhile, back downstairs, James puts the midget on the table and demands to know why was he at his house. The midget continues telling him that he was paid not to tell, which only angers James, who puts his gun out on him. When he does, the midget [[Defecation|defecates]]. Back at Sylvester's house, he, Twan and Gwendolyn are playing cards when the phone rings. When Gwendolyn answers it, she hears a panicked Bridget, who tells her she found her number in James' pocket. After a minute, Gwendolyn hangs up and gives Sylvester and Twan the address to the house, presumably to stop the fight. Back at James' house, James and the midget continue fighting until Bridget comes back to the kitchen with a [[double barreled shotgun]]. When James points the gun to Bridget, the midget takes his inhaler out. A few seconds later, Sylvester and Twan bust open the door and Sylvester points his gun at James. Sylvester and Twan notice a peculiar odor in the house. Due to Sylvester and Twan's entrance, the midget faints on the table.  : ''Ending cliffhanger-outro line: "Ohhh, while Twan and Sylvester are sniffin' around, tryin' to figure out what's that smellâas they turn and look at each other like, 'What the hell?"''  ;Chapter 11 In this chapter, the midget wakes up peculiar to seeing three guns and tries to get out of the situation. Sylvester then begs Bridget and James to put their guns down, to which they adamantly refuse. Bridget then tells Sylvester she will drop the gun if James does not hurt the midget, whose name is revealed as "Big Man", a stripper at a club called Dixie's. When Sylvester asks why he was named that, the midget points down to his pants and tell him he is "blessed". After seeing Sylvester and Big Man communicating, James shuts them up calling them "Chuck and Rufus", which confuses Sylvester, who demands to know how James knew of them, though James acts bewildered to Sylvester's question. Just as James looks as if he was going to answer, Bridget starts getting sick. It is then revealed that Bridget is three months pregnant, presumably with James' baby. After James' constant prompts to Sylvester, Twan and Big Man with his gun to leave, Bridget stops him and admits paying Big Man and even admitted that she knew that James had been cheating on her with Gwendolyn, saying that she had followed him around. When James demands to know what Bridget is really telling him, Bridget says that Big Man is her baby's father, which negates her previous excuse from chapter 9 as being "that time of the month". Big Man again faints at the news.  Kelly switches from [[first-person narrative|first person]] (as Sylvester) to [[Third-person narrative|third person]] narrative in the middle of this chapter as the focus fades away from his character.''  : ''Ending cliffhanger-outro line: "The midget faints again, while Twan and Sylvester is trippin. The midget's the baby's daddy. Woo!"''  ;Chapter 12 [[File:Trappedinthcloset.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram of all relationships up to Chapter 22 of ''Trapped in the Closet'']] Back at Cathy's house, she, Rufus and Chuck get up from the floor. After Cathy closes the door, she and Rufus argue about the reasons why Sylvester almost shot at them in the previous chapters, with Cathy angered about Rufus "creeping" around with Chuck, who is the deacon of Rufus' church, telling him "ain't no telling what I've got", referring to [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. Chuck gets angry at this and threatens Cathy with a knife, which prompts Cathy to force him to do it. Rufus then calms them down and tries to resolve the matter but neither Cathy or Chuck listen, as they continue arguing, even as the phone rings. When it rings a second time, Cathy answers it and it is Gwendolyn and she begins telling Cathy about the drama that had gone on. When Gwendolyn mentions that she saw Sylvester in Paje's club with "some crusty wig-wearing ass ho", Cathy realizes the man she had slept with that night was Sylvester. When Cathy tries telling her who the "ho" was, Gwendolyn stops her and tells her more about James and his situation. When an angry Rufus demands Cathy to finish their conversation, Cathy shuts Gwendolyn up and tells her she was the "ho" that had been with Sylvester.  : ''Ending cliffhanger line: "I'm sorry, girl, but that ho was me...."  In the original version of Chapter 12, (which was originally going to be Chapter 6), Rufus said he was going to take back Cathy. This idea was later incorporated into the later chapters. Also Gwen never called Cathy so Gwen would've never known Cathy was the one that slept with Sylvester.  [[File:Trapped In The Closet Chapters 13-22.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of the ''Trapped in the Closet'' chapter 12.22 DVD, containing the videos of the second installment of the series.]]  ;Chapter 13 The chapter initially starts with Sylvester and Twan in Sylvester's car though it is not clear at first where they are going. When Sylvester tells Twan to be on his best behavior and reminds Twan about how he got sent to jail, Twan says it "was because of Roxanne and that bitch Tina", which Sylvester remembers his wife mentioning their names in chapter five. The scene soon cuts to Rosie the nosy neighbor and her husband Randolph (played by R. Kelly), who argue over Rosie spying on other neighbors. The argument ends when the scene cuts back to Sylvester explaining to Twan that he has to collect money from someone, he tells Twan to leave the car in drive and be on the lookout and enters a restaurant. An hour goes by with no sign of Sylvester.  :''Ending line: "(Time goes by) it's now one hour later...."  ;Chapter 14 In chapter fourteen, it is revealed that apparently Sylvester and Cathy, who shows up in a blond wig and black dress, made a deal for Sylvester to get caught by her pastor husband Rufus but the deal had apparently backfired, not only by Cathy's realization that Sylvester and her best friend Gwendolyn were married but also due to Cathy not wanting to end her marriage to Rufus, with Cathy later admitting she had changed her mind on the deal. When Sylvester threatens to leave, Cathy tries to explain the reasons why. A waitress comes by and offers them drinks. Sylvester looks at the waitress thinking to himself that she looked familiar. Meanwhile, outside at Sylvester's car, Twan gets a call from a friend (only shown by a close up of his mouth) about Tina, telling him Tina had stopped being a [[prostitution|prostitute]] and was working at a "legit" place. He later tells Twan that Tina was working at the same restaurant as Sylvester with Cathy. Back at the restaurant, Sylvester notices the waitress but can't think from where, until he sees her name tag which says "Tina". Sylvester then says he wants to talk to her but she gets scared and calls for her friend/co-worker Roxanne, who runs out with a frying pan. After Tina breaks a beer bottle and makes karate-styled moves saying to Sylvester that she and Roxanne take [[Tae Bo]], Cathy and the rest of the patrons leave quickly, leaving Sylvester alone with Tina and Roxanne. Just as Tina and Roxanne are about to attack, Twan comes busting through the door threatening them.  : ''Ending cliffhanger line: "I will kill both of y'all knucklehead asses...!"  ;Chapter 15  With Twan, Sylvester, Tina and Roxanne in the now-empty restaurant, Twan seeks revenge on Tina and Roxanne on his arrest three years ago. Sylvester tries calming Twan down reminding him he's on [[house arrest]] and that a violent outburst would lead to a more serious time in prison. After convincing Twan to let him talk to them, Sylvester approaches the two ladies and ask them what had happened on the day of his arrest. Tina and Roxanne explain that they were on a "simple operation" describing a "[[drug trafficking|trip]]" to [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. Roxanne tells Sylvester that a [[substance intoxication|high]] Twan was swerving on the road and cutting up on the both of them, even turning his music loud playing "[[Mary Jane (Rick James song)|Mary Jane]]" and screaming "I'm Rick James, bitch!" Tina explains that as soon as that happened, they heard not only police squad cars but also a helicopter. Twan's car breaks down and all three are eventually arrested. In the interrogation room, the police tell the women that Twan blamed the drug deal on them in order to save his own skin. It is then when Roxanne tells Twan she turned him in. Roxanne says Tina protected him because Tina was pregnant with Twan's baby at the time.  : ''Ending cliffhanger line: "Because at the time I was pregnant by you, T."  [[Indie folk]] musician [[Will Oldham]] makes a cameo in this chapter as one of the police officers in the interrogation.  ;Chapter 16 Sylvester, stunned at first at the news of Tina having Twan's child, congratulates Twan on the news but Twan is not convinced, accusing Tina of lying to him. This makes Tina's eye twitch, which had started when Sylvester had first approached her near the end of chapter 14. When Sylvester asks Roxanne about it, Roxanne explains a [[pimp]] had hit Tina in the eye a year ago and that she's had bad nerves ever since. Twan then pulls Sylvester to the side and begins wondering if he is really the father of Tina's child. Sylvester convinces him that a child would calm him down. When Twan tells Tina that he wants to make this work, Roxanne kisses Tina and reveals they are lovers.  :''Ending cliffhanger line: "I'm fucking her now...."  In the commentary remix on the ''Trapped in the Closet'' DVD, Kelly tells the audience that in the upcoming chapters he will probably give Tina about three chapters to explain her nervous eye twitch.  ;Chapter 17 Stunned at the news of Roxanne and Tina being lovers, a frustrated Sylvester points his gun at the both of them, but soon stops because of his tolerance to [[lesbian]]s, while Twan kept egging him to shoot them. Sylvester tries to get Twan to leave the restaurant. It's only after Twan threatens Tina and Roxanne that he will buy a gun and come back for them later that Sylvester finally convinces Twan to leave.  :''Ending line: "Give me my motherfuckin' coat!"  ;Chapter 18 Back at the car as they drive away, Twan is still angry over seeing Roxanne and Tina together, despite Sylvester's efforts to calm him down. Around this time, Sylvester gets a phone call from Gwendolyn, who tells him that his parents, O'Dale and Myrna, got into it and Myrna had O'Dale put in jail. The scene then shifts to Rufus' church where he is leading the worship song, "Jesus Will Work It Out", with Reverend Mosley James Evans and the Peace Within Choir. When the song reaches a climax, Rufus gets a phone call and excuses himself to his office. It's Chuck, who's crying and upset over not seeing Rufus since the incident in the earlier chapters. Rufus and Chuck argue when Cathy walks in Rufus' office. When Cathy asks Rufus who was on the phone, Chuck, who can be heard accidentally on speaker phone, cries out for Rufus, which angers Cathy and the two argue before Rufus sends Cathy out to deal with the situation. Rufus then tries to let Chuck come see him so they can talk but Chuck refuses. Rufus then tells Chuck that he wants to stay married because he loves his wife and is a Pastor as the reason he doesn't want to see Chuck anymore. This angers Chuck, who threatens to reveal their relationship. When Rufus again tries to get Chuck to come see him, Chuck reveals he is recovering at a hospital.  :''Ending "cliffhanger" line: Chuck coughs and says "Because I'm in the hospital...."  ;Chapter 19 Reverend Mosley James Evans and the Peace Within Choir attempt to persuade Pimp Lucius, a [[pimp]] with a severe [[stuttering]] problem, to stop pimping and to turn his life around. As the choir sings "you can do it Pimp Lucius," Lucius pretends to accept the offer and leaves the church.  However, he then tells his pimpin' partner, Bishop Craig, that he is never going to "s-s-s-s-s-stop p-p-p-pimpin," because "p-p-p-pimpin's for life." Then he tells Bishop Craig "now let's get this mmm-mmmm money."  :''Ending scene: Pimp Lucius points to the choir and says, "CHURCH! Church!" He becomes embarrassed and overwhelmed by being on the altar, looks around, and accidentally blurts out "SHIT!" He then says "oops," and leaves the church with Bishop Craig and his "[[Street prostitution|escorts]]".  ;Chapter 20 This chapter shows Rosie the Nosy Neighbor's house where Rosie is seen in her chair reading the [[Bible]] when her husband Randolph comes in shouting, "he's got the package!" to Rosie. Unwilling to listen to reason, when Randolph tells her he has news on the pastor (Rufus), she demands to know what was going on with him. After some bickering, Randolph tells Rosie the story: while working as a janitor for the church, Randolph hears Rufus coming into the office. Randolph hid in the closet and unintentionally overheard the conversation seen in chapter eighteen among Chuck, Rufus and Cathy. After relaying the story, Rosie asks Randolph why he had said the pastor had "the package", Randolph says that Chuck told him he was at the hospital. Rosie immediately decides to inform the masses, despite Randolph's protests. The chapter ends with Randolph sitting on the couch, falling asleep.  :''Ending line: "Now don't go tellin' ev'rybody âround town, Rosie, with your big-mouthed ass!"''  :"The Package" is implied to be [[HIV/AIDS]] because of the slang term ''the whole package'',<ref></ref> defined as prison slang for the disease. Given the large-scale interconnecting relationships in the series, this is a serious issue affecting most if not all of the characters.  ;Chapter 21 Sylvester and Twan go to visit an apparent [[mobster]] named Joey. Sylvester informs Joey of some job that could get them a lot of money. While there, Joey accuses Twan of being a cop, as well as calling him "[[LL Cool J|LL Fool J]]," deeply offending Twan. Sylvester, trying to defuse the situation, asks Twan to wait outside the office while he and Joey discuss business. As Twan leaves the room, he remarks, "I'll be listening from the outside." Joey replies, "Yeah, yeah, whatever. [[Mama Said Knock You Out (song)|Mama said knock you out]], fuck outta here." While waiting outside, Twan has a nightmare of Sylvester and him in the same situation, being pointed at with guns. In the end, Sylvester wakes Twan up, then Joey and Sylvester say their goodbyes, and Joey asks Sylvester to tell Gwendolyn he says hello, as their deal is sealed.  :'' Ending scene: Joey and his goons laugh at Twan for having a nightmare, and Joey tells Sylvester to say hello to Gwendolyn for him. :'' Ending line: "''Imma shoot me a motherfucker today, I'mma shoot me a motherfucker today!" and "âThis guy,â and puffing smoke.''  ;Chapter 22 [[File:Trapped in the Closet Character Map.png|thumb|right|Diagram of all relationships up to Chapter 33 of ''Trapped in the Closet'']] The scene opens to O'Dale and Myrna's voicemail and eventually fades into the middle of the voicemail box where the narrator (Kelly) says, "and now the rumor." Throughout a series of phone conversations among all of the original characters from Chapters 1â12 and those introduced in Chapter 13â22, rumors of "The Package" circulate. Because Chuck has it, it has possibly been passed to Rufus, to his wife Cathy, to Sylvester, and to Gwendolyn. In addition, Bridget realizes that James knows both Chuck and Rufus, though he tried to hide it from her earlier, suggesting he may be on the "[[Down-low (MSM)|down-low]]" with Chuck as well. Gwendolyn also cheated on Sylvester with James. However, she used a condom as revealed in Chapter 4. This would put Bridget, Big Man, and James at serious risk. Lastly, Pimp Lucius gets a similar concerned call from an unidentified woman (who may have gotten "The Package" from Big Man, and subsequently passed it to Pimp Lucius).  :''Closing scene: The screen fades to black with the words "[[Trapped in the Closet: The Next Installment|To be continued]]".''

Meanwhile, outside, Pimp Lucius is yelling at his prostitutes over a lack of money that's been coming in. He then states if he doesn't get his money soon he'll start hitting the girls, and it is revealed that he is responsible for Tina's nervous twitch. Sylvester and Twan come outside where after a comical encounter with Lucius, they attempt to walk away ending the chapter. :''Ending cliffhanger-outro line: "...Sylvester you real funny."  ;Chapter 25 The chapter begins directly after the previous as Pimp Lucius calls Sylvester over to ask him for a couple of "racks".

The chapter switches to a pan on the door of Doctor William T. Perry, a marriage counselor. The doctor is getting off the phone as Rufus and an impatient Cathy walk into the room. Rufus is at first reluctant and asks the doctor not to record their session. Cathy then breaks down and begins to cry over the fact that Rufus loves a man over her. Rufus then pronounces that he is confused and still loves Chuck. :''Ending cliffhanger-outro line: "...What have I done?"  ;Chapter 27 This chapter begins with Rufus getting on his knees and praying to God to change his ways. Meanwhile, Doctor Perry tries to convince Cathy to go back inside the room and console Rufus as well as make amends.

Back in the office, Rufus calls out to God asking how God was going to help him. Just as he does this, Cathy comes back in the room and forgives Rufusâsaying she's willing to work it out. The chapter then switches over to Rufus' confessional. Rufus was tricked into coming on the show by the staff; he believed he was there to talk about the church and the community but he is bombarded by questions about his personal life. After an insinuation by an off-screen director, he leaves the set. :''Ending cliffhanger-outro line: "...Does Chuck have AIDS? Is that what the Package is?! Sir?

She also states she will be coming onto the Out of the Closet show.

Sylvester warns him one more time about the delirious mobster they're about to meet. The two of them then get into the car. The chapter then switches the simultaneous confessional of both Sylvester and Twan. Twan starts off by saying that Sylvester never lets him have fun. Sylvester then informs the viewers that Twan like to talk a lot but can't really back it up. He then informs him that true thugs move in silence. After a comical dialogue, the chapter ends with them laughing. :''Ending cliffhanger-outro line: "...Man you gotta love this man."  ;Chapter 31 The chapter involves Pimp Lucius going home to see his parents, who turn out to be Randolph and Rosy.

Lucius then reflects as the girls walk away. The chapter then goes over to the dramatic confessional of Pimp Lucius alongside his four prostitutes. He talks about his father denying him of money and a place to sleep. He wonders why his father could have done something like this to him, considering the fact that he is family. :''Ending cliffhanger-outro line: "...Call me a pimp, a thug, I'm still his blood.

The conclusion of Part 3 begins with the character Bankhead opening the door, at first reluctant to let the men in. He warns and threatens them and then guides the men to Beeno. Beeno is eating sunflower seeds aggressively and listens to Sylvester as he makes his proposal. Something seems to be bothering Beeno's throat and he reveals that Joey shot him in the neck during a past deal.

Transporter 2
 Frank Martin has relocated from southern France to [[Miami, Florida]]. As a favor, he becomes a temporary chauffeur for the wealthy Billings family. The marriage of Jefferson and Audrey Billings is under great strain due to the demands of his high-profile government job. Frank bonds with their son, Jack, whom he drives to and from elementary school in his new [[Audi A8 W12]]. Later, a somewhat drunk Audrey shows up at Frank's home and tries to seduce him, but he tactfully sends her home.  Frank prepares for the arrival of Inspector Tarconi, his detective friend from France, who has come to spend his holiday in Florida with Frank. When Frank takes Jack for a medical checkup, he realizes barely in time that impostors have killed and replaced the doctor and receptionist. A lengthy fight erupts between villains, led by Lola, and the unarmed Frank; which results in the death of one of the fake doctors. Frank escapes with Jack. Just as they arrive at Jack's house, he receives a phone call, informing him that he and Jack are in the sights of a sniper capable of penetrating the car's bulletproof glass. Frank is forced to let Lola into the car; they speed away with Jack, shaking off many pursuing police cars.  They arrive at a warehouse, where Frank meets Gianni, the ringleader of the operation. Frank is ordered to leave without Jack. He discovers an explosive attached to the car and succeeds in removing it prior to detonation. Jack is returned to his family after the payment of a ransom, but unknown to them and Frank, Jack has been injected with a deadly virus that will eventually kill anyone who the child breathes on.  Suspected by everyone except Audrey of being one of the kidnappers, Frank tracks down the remaining fake doctor, Dimitri, with Tarconi's assistance. Frank pretends to infect Dimitri with the same virus, then lets him escape. Dimitri panics and hurries to a lab to get the cure, with Frank following behind. In his panic, Dimitri kills Tipov, another of Gianni's men, in his attempt to force the scientist in charge of the lab to give him the cure. Frank arrives and kills first another henchman, then Dimitri (after revealing the Dimitri was not infected after all); but when Frank refuses to bargain with him, the scientist hurls the only two vials containing the antidote out of the window into traffic. Frank manages to retrieve only one vial intact.  Frank sneaks back into the Billings home and tells an already ailing Audrey what is happening. He uses the antidote on Jack. Meanwhile, a coughing Jefferson, the director of National Drug Control Policy, addresses the heads of many anti-drug organizations from around the world at a conference; infecting all of them in the process.  Frank drives to the house of Gianni, who has decided to inject himself with the remaining supply of antidote as a precaution. After dispatching Gianni's many henchmen, Frank has the archvillain at gunpoint. Gianni explains that a Colombian drug cartel is paying him to get rid of its enemies; and that Frank cannot risk killing him, for his death would render the antidote unusable. An armed Lola shows up, leading to a standoff. Gianni leaves Lola to deal with Frank; which results in Frank finally killing her by kicking her into a [[wine rack]] with sharp metal points.  Frank tracks Gianni, who is making an escape in his helicopter to a waiting jet. Using a [[Lamborghini Murcielago Roadster]] from Gianni's garage, Frank speeds to the airport and boards Gianni's jet by driving onto the runway and climbing onto the jet's nose gear. After killing the co-pilot; Frank gets into the interior of the plane and confronts Gianni, who pulls a gun on him. When they wrestle for it, a round kills the pilot and the plane crashes into the ocean. Frank incapacitates Gianni by paralyzing him (rendering him immobile while preserving the antidote in his system), then pushes his captive and himself out of the sinking plane. Boats converge to pick them up.  The Billings are given the antidote. When Frank visits them in the hospital, before entering their room, he sees them with Jack, who is joking with them. He silently walks back to his car, where Tarconi is waiting. He drops his friend at the airport. Alone, Frank receives a call from a man who needs a transporter, to which he replies: "I'm listening."

 One week before her [[vaginoplasty]], a conservative [[transgender]] woman named Sabrina 'Bree' Osbourne ([[Felicity Huffman]]) receives an unexpected phone call from a young man named Toby Wilkins ([[Kevin Zegers]]), a 17-year-old jailed in [[New York City]]. He asks for Stanley Schupak (Bree's birth name), claiming to be Stanley's son.  Bree was previously unaware she had a son; she now wants to break with her past and renounce him. However, Bree's [[psychotherapist|therapist]] ([[Elizabeth PeÃ±a]]) refuses permission for her operation if she does not face up to her past ties before facing her new future.  Bree flies from [[Los Angeles]] to [[New York City]] to bail Toby out of jail. Toby is a foul-mouthed [[runaway (dependent)|runaway]] plus small-time [[drug user]] and [[male prostitute|male "hustler"]]. His mother committed [[suicide]] when he was a child after which he was raised by his stepfather, whom he says he does not want to see.  Bree pretends to be a [[Christian]] [[missionary]] and persuades Toby to ride with her back to the West Coast, secretly planning to leave him at his stepfather's along the way. When they arrive in the  town of Callicoon, Kentucky,<ref></ref> it turns out that Toby's stepfather was very [[abusive]] and he [[child sexual abuse|molested him]] several times in his youth. To Bree's dismay, her plan to leave Toby with him fails miserably. Bree and Toby continue driving to [[Los Angeles]] together. They also stop by a house in [[Dallas]] where a group of transgender women (many of whom are old friends of Bree's) are hosting a gender pride gathering. Later on in the trip, when Bree has to urinate, Toby accidentally discovers that Bree has [[male genitalia]]. He tries to be open-minded about it, but is angry that Bree had not told him prior to his unintentional discovery.  After their car and money are stolen by a young hitchhiking [[hippie]] who calls himself a "[[peyote]] [[Plastic shaman|shaman]]" (Grant Monohon), Toby makes some money by prostituting himself to a truck driver. To Bree he pretends that he got the money from selling some drugs he had taken along for his own use. They get a ride with a kindly rancher Calvin Many Goats ([[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]]) to Bree's parents' house in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Calvin and Bree hit it off very well and flirt a little, which disturbs Toby. Here they find her pampered and self-centred mother Elizabeth ([[Fionnula Flanagan]]), her [[Jewish]] father Murray ([[Burt Young]]) who seems to be dominated by Elizabeth, and her rebellious and sarcastic sister Sydney ([[Carrie Preston]]). Elizabeth disapproves of Bree's [[transsexuality]] (it is mentioned that she has been estranged for some time from her because of her [[transphobia]]), but is astonished to find out she has a grandson. She is kind to Toby and invites him to stay and live with them. Toby likes the luxury and kindness, but hesitates because he does not like how disrespectful they are to Bree. Realizing he has feelings for Bree, he tries to seduce her, saying that he will marry her if she wants. Bree realizes she must tell Toby the truth immediately, saying that she was his real father. Toby is appalled and infuriated that Bree had not disclosed this earlier. Overnight he steals money and valuable antiques from the house and disappears. Heartbroken, Bree returns to Los Angeles via a plane ticket bought by her parents. Her family finally accepts her calling herself Bree, she has a completely successful surgery, but she is unhappy because she feels she will never again see or hear from Toby. The therapist visits Bree in recovery and Bree, after she confesses she made a mistake, sobs and cries heavily on her shoulder.  Some months later, Bree is surprised to see Toby knock at her front door. Bree invites Toby inside and he reveals to her he has turned 18, bleached his hair blonde, and has become an adult actor in [[Gay pornography|gay pornographic]] films in Los Angeles. Bree is vibrant, happy, and enjoying her job as a waitress at the restaurant where she was formerly washing-up. Bree and Toby reconcile, seemingly happy to have each other.  
Trapped in the Closet Chapters 1â12
 ;Chapter 1 The first chapter begins with Sylvester ([[R. Kelly]]) waking up at around 7:00 in the morning in another person's bed. Sylvester realizes when he wakes up that another woman who is not his wife approaches him and kisses him. After scolding himself for committing [[infidelity]], he puts on the rest of his clothes and grabs his car keys and prepares to make his way home when the woman comes back, stopping him from moving, telling him her husband is coming up the stairs. She insists Sylvester hide in the closet but Sylvester insists on jumping out of a window. When the woman reminds him they are on the fifth floor, Sylvester thinks for a moment and agrees to hide in the closet. As soon after that, her husband walks in and she lies to him, which gets Sylvester to think she should win an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for her acting. They then began making love in the bed when Sylvester's cell phone goes off. Sylvester tries to put it on [[vibrating alert|vibrate]] but the husband starts suspecting something is up and goes to investigate. After searching through a shower curtain, under the bed and even the dresser, he slowly approaches the closet. Sylvester takes his [[Beretta|gun]] out in preparation. The chapter ends with the husband opening the closet.  ;Chapter 2 The second chapter starts with the husband now knowing what his wife was doing behind his back. Sylvester tries calming him down but to no avail as he begins arguing with his wife. The husband nearly attacks Sylvester but stops due to the fact Sylvester is holding a gun. When the husband's cell phone rings, he tells Sylvester that he is a [[pastor]], which Sylvester thinks would be reasonable to not resort to a violent outburst. When Sylvester decides to leave, the husband tells him to stay because he wants to reveal a "secret" to him and his wife. He then calls someone on his cell phone telling them to "turn the car around". When the person alarms him that he is at "the apartment", the husband calls the person up. Sylvester and the pastor's wife are both anxious as to what the husband is about to reveal. When the husband does not answer Sylvester's questions quickly enough on who he has been talking to, he threatens to shoot both him and his wife. Just as Sylvester gets to the count of four, someone knocks on the door. The husband opens the door and the person turns out to be another man.  ;Chapter 3  Chapter three starts with all four people in the room. A shocked and confused Sylvester demands to leave after getting this news but the wife tells him to stay. She then argues with her husband, whose name is revealed to be Rufus, over his own infidelity and they argue over whose cheating was worse. The wife berates Rufus for revealing his cheating to upset her after he had busted her with Sylvester. When Sylvester quiets them and demands more explanation, the other man, Chuck, begins explaining how their affair came about. Sylvester stops him, however, from revealing any more details. After the wife berates Rufus again, Rufus reveals her real name, which is Cathy, which shocks Sylvester, who was told her name was Mary. When Sylvester again threatens to shoot them, Rufus, Cathy and Chuck all begin yelling at each other, pushing Sylvester to shoot his gun in the air to quiet them, causing them to lie on the floor. Sylvester then calls his home on his cell phone to his home but is stunned to find another man is on the phone. He then quickly bolts out of the apartment while Cathy, Rufus and Chuck remain lying on the floor.  ;Chapter 4 Sylvester is seen in chapter four rushing home, angered and belligerent over the events of the previous night. As he drives home, he is pulled over by a police officer, who gives him a ticket for speeding. When he arrives home, he starts asking his wife who had answered his phone. She responds that it was her brother Twan, whom she had reminded Sylvester earlier was coming home from prison. Sylvester remembers and then apologizes to his wife before they begin engaging in sexual intercourse. In the middle of it, however, Sylvester's wife, whose name is revealed to be Gwendolyn, sees a used condom on the side of the bed, covers it up, and then jumps on top of a shocked Sylvester, who tries to get Gwendolyn to stop because he is afraid he might have a [[seizure]]. When she demands him to keep going, Sylvester tries reminding her that his leg was beginning to cramp. When Gwendolyn finally gets off him, Sylvester flips the bed cover to find the used condom that she had tried to hide from him.  ;Chapter 5 Chapter five starts with Sylvester now knowing his wife had cheated on him and he starts demanding answers. After a few more angry outbursts, Gwendolyn returns with her own knowledge of Sylvester's infidelity. He quickly turns it back around to her infidelity. When he berates her for not giving him an answer, she quickly comes up with certain names including friends of hers, named "Roxanne and Tina", and also mentions "Rufus and Chuck", which confuses Sylvester. She then mentions she and Cathy went to high school and were friends, and it was Cathy who introduced Gwendolyn to the police officer that stopped Sylvester, confirming that the police officer was her secret lover.  ;Chapter 6 After the previous chapter's revelation at the end, Sylvester begins laughing at the entire situation. After a second, Gwendolyn joins him in the laughter and Sylvester begins explaining the events the previous night. Meanwhile the cop who pulled Sylvester over and the man Gwendolyn admits cheating on Sylvester with, whose name is revealed to be James, turns his car back around concerned for Gwendolyn's safety. When he sees Sylvester's car parked in a crooked space with the lights still on and sees the back door busted in, he picks up his gun and goes in to investigate. When he hears Sylvester and Gwendolyn laughing, James mistakes it for [[domestic violence|abuse]]. When Gwendolyn yells, "Sylvester, you're killing me", he busts in the door with Sylvester noticing the cop who pulled him over. Sylvester then pulls his gun out demanding the cop leave. After James' constant demand to freeze and Gwendolyn's pleas to Sylvester, he puts the gun down and puts his hands up. When James winks and smiles at him, an angry Sylvester rushes to James and they both wrestle with control of the gun, before thinking of it, a shot accidentally goes off.  ;Chapter 7 This chapter reveals it was Twan, Gwendolyn's brother who was just released from prison, was the one who was shot. After realizing who it was, Sylvester and James argue at who was at fault with the shooting, with Sylvester blaming the entire incident on the cop. Twan is presumed to be dead but in the middle of Sylvester, James and Gwendolyn arguing, Twan coughs, assuring them he is okay and that he was only non-fatally shot in the shoulder. As Twan recovers in the bathroom, Sylvester begins telling him what caused the incident when someone knocks on the door. After being hesitant with answering the door, Sylvester grabs his gun and aims it at the door, Twan joins him snatching James' gun. At the count of three, Twan opens the door and it is revealed to be the next door neighbor, Rosie, who is shown with a spatula in her hand. A relieved Sylvester and Gwendolyn invite Rosie in while James snatches his gun back from a bewildered Twan's hands and leaves.  ;Chapter 8 In this chapter, a tired and frustrated James drives back to his house when his wife Bridget calls him (Kelly sings all of Bridget's lines with a fake [[Southern American English|Southern accent]].) James tells a concerned Bridget that he was heading home in which Bridget happily tells him she had baked him a cherry pie. Meanwhile at Sylvester's house, Rosie, the next door neighbor, tells Sylvester, Twan and Gwendolyn that she could not stand the cop that just left their house causing Gwendolyn, Sylvester and Twan to laugh. Back at James' house, he pulls up to the garage. A panicked Bridget rushes to the door and kisses James. When James asks her why she looked jittery, Bridget excuses it as "[[Menstrual cycle|it's that time of the month]]". When Bridget tries getting him upstairs for pears, James insists on heating some leftover chicken. Bridget's nervous breakdown finally leads to James demanding a straight answer from Bridget. James then starts to wonder if Bridget had also cheated on him. Unbeknownst to him and from the looks of a nervous Bridget, it becomes clear another man is still in the house.  ;Chapter 9 James starts investigating his house for any possible intruders. When he hears a noise, he begins to search all over the kitchen while a panicked Bridget stands over by the dishes. After James checks the oven and looks behind the fridge, he notices the cherry pie with a slice cut out. When he realizes that Bridget is [[Food allergy|allergic to cherries]], he turns to her and moves slowly to a scared Bridget. After demanding Bridget to move from her spot, which she eventually does, he sees the cabinet and slowly approaches it. Just as he opens it, the video suddenly stops and the narrator exits out of a closet and, [[Fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]], tells the audience that the man, hiding in the cabinet, is a [[midget]].  ;Chapter 10 In this chapter, the midget jumps out of the cabinet and fights with James. After James' constant roughing up on the midget, Bridget runs upstairs where she puts out a number from her purse. Meanwhile back downstairs, James puts the midget on the table and demands to know why was he at his house. The midget continues telling him that he was paid not to tell, which only angers James, who puts his gun out on him. When he does, the midget commits [[bowel movements]]. Back at Sylvester's house, he, Twan and Gwendolyn are playing cards when the phone rings. When Gwendolyn answers it, she hears a panicked Bridget, who tells her she found her number in James' pocket. After a minute, Gwendolyn hangs up and gives Sylvester and Twan the address to the house presumably to stop the fight. Back at James' house, James and the midget continue fighting until Bridget comes back to the kitchen with a [[double barrelled shotgun]]. When James points the gun to Bridget, the midget takes his inhaler out. A few seconds later, Sylvester and Twan bust open the door and Sylvester points his gun at James. Sylvester and Twan notice a peculiar odor in the house. Due to Sylvester and Twan's entrance, the midget faints on the table.  ;Chapter 11 In this chapter, the midget wakes up peculiar to seeing three guns and tries to get out of the situation. Sylvester then begs Bridget and James to put their guns down, which they adamantly refuse. Bridget then tells Sylvester she will drop the gun if James does not hurt the midget, whose name is revealed as "Big Man", a stripper at a club called Dixie's. When Sylvester asks why he was named that, the midget points down to his pants and tell him he is "blessed". After seeing Sylvester and Big Man communicating, James shuts them up calling them "Chuck and Rufus", which confuses Sylvester, who demands to know how James knew of them, though James acts bewildered to Sylvester's question. Just as James looks as if he was going to answer, Bridget starts getting sick. It is then revealed that Bridget is three-months pregnant, presumably with James' baby. After James' constant prompts to Sylvester, Twan and Big Man with his gun to leave, Bridget stops him and admits paying Big Man and even admitted that she knew that James had been cheating on her with Gwendolyn saying that she had followed him around. When James demands to know what Bridget is really telling him, Bridget says that Big Man is her baby's father, which negates her previous excuse from chapter 9 as being "that time of the month". The midget again faints at the news.  ;Chapter 12 Back at Cathy's house, she, Rufus and Chuck get up from the floor. After Cathy closes the door, she and Rufus argue about the reasons why Sylvester almost shot at them from the previous chapters, with Cathy angered about Rufus "creeping" around with Chuck, who is the deacon of Rufus' church, telling him "ain't no telling what I've got", referring to (sexually transmitted disease). Chuck gets angry at this and threatens Cathy with a knife, which prompts Cathy to force him to do it. Rufus then calms them down and tries to resolve the matter but neither Cathy or Chuck listen, as they continue arguing, even as the phone rings. When it rings a second time, Cathy answers it and it is Gwendolyn and she begins telling Cathy about the drama that had gone on. When Gwendolyn mentions that she saw Sylvester in Paje's club with "some crusty wig-wearing ass ho", Cathy realizes the man she had slept with that night was Sylvester. When Cathy tries telling her who the "ho" was, Gwendolyn stops her and tells her more about James and his situation. When an angry Rufus demands Cathy to finish their conversation, Cathy shuts Gwendolyn up and tells her she was the "ho" that had been with Sylvester.  
The Trouble with Men and Women
 Serious and intense Matt is tired of mooning over a woman who has deserted him for a life in the [[United States]]. After enduring the bar room philosophising of his friends as they vainly try to cheer him up, he starts dating various women, desperate for an understanding of the opposite sex. Yet he may well harbour the notion that it is his best mateâs girlfriend that he is destined to be with.  
The Truth About Love (film)
 After Alice Holbrook (Jennifer Love Hewitt), a happily married English woman living in Bristol, receives an anonymous Valentine's Day card with radish seeds in it, she automatically assumes the card is from her supposedly loving lawyer husband, Sam (Jimi Mistry), and that he is trying to be romantic. In return, Alice decides to write an anonymous reply to her husband to keep the gimmick going, but only accidentally sends the card after a drunken night with her sister. What Alice does not realise, however, is that her husband did, in fact, not send her the original Valentine's Day card; her husband's best friend and lawyer partner, Archie (Dougray Scott), did.  When Alice's husband does not mention that he has received her card, Alice becomes suspicious that he is cheating on her with another woman. In an attempt to discover the truth, Alice calls her husband and pretends to be another woman with a deep, sultry voice who she calls "Anonymous." After her husband agrees to meet with "Anonymous," Alice becomes even more distraught, but continues to try and win her husband back. However, in the process, she discovers her husband Sam is already having another affair with a woman named Katya and is now knowingly starting a second affair with "Anonymous." After breaking down over this fact, she goes to visit Archie in the sexy outfit she planned to woo Sam back with, and while Archie and she kiss, he assumes she is having an extra-marital affair with someone other than Sam and refuses to be a part of it.  Alice decides to forge ahead with her "affair" with Sam as "Anonymous," and while having supposedly extramarital sex with him, she removes his wedding ring from his finger with her lips. Afterwards, however, Sam declares "Alice is nothing compared to [Anonymous]" and that he has never truly loved Alice, and so she becomes very upset and flees the hotel. When she is running away, however, she runs into Katya, who discovers that Sam is not only cheating on his wife but also on her.  While Sam does win his big court case next, he returns home to find his precious wine scattered throughout the neighborhood and his clothes thrown in the street (all done by Alice), as well as Katya waiting at his house to tell Alice of their affair as revenge. When Katya sees Alice, however, she calls her "Anonymous," and so Sam realizes that Alice has been "Anonymous" all the while. Alice even shows Sam how she removed the ring from his finger to prove it. While Sam attempt to plead with Sam, Alice insists on a divorce and Katya walks out on Sam as well.  The film then fast forwards to a little time later. Katya took her story as well as that of "Anonymous" to the press and so Sam's reputation as an upstanding lawyer has been ruined. Furthermore, the press exposes that Alice was, in fact, not having an extramarital affair as Archie previously thought. This realisation prompts Archie to attempt to tell Alice about his feelings for her, but she cannot see past their friendship. Because of this, Archie decides he cannot get over Alice while still in Bristol, so he takes a job in Japan. First though, he sends a goodbye letter to Alice, in which he includes "P.S. I hope you liked the radishes," finally letting her know that the original Valentine's Day card was from him and not Sam. Alice chases after Archie and finally catches him after a series of debacles at the train station, including him having to actually stop the train. They kiss and declare they love each other. The movie ends when Alice lovingly looks up at the man who really thinks she is "the perfect woman" and says "Take me home and radish me."  
Tsotsi
 Because his mother is dying of a terminal disease, David (Benny Moshe) runs away from an abusive father and lives with other homeless children in a series of large concrete construction pipes. A few years later, David, who now goes by the name Tsotsi ([[Presley Chweneyagae]]), is the leader of a gang which includes his friends Butcher (Zenzo Ngqobe), Aap (Kenneth Nkosi) and Boston (Mothusi Magano). After getting involved in a murder committed by Butcher during a [[wikt:mugging|mugging]], Tsotsi and Boston get into a fight which leaves Boston badly injured. Tsotsi later shoots Pumla (Nambitha Mpumlwana), a young woman, while [[carjacking|stealing her car]], only to discover a three-month-old baby boy in the back seat. Tsotsi hastily strips the car of its valuables and takes the baby back to his shack. Pumla survives the attack and works with a police artist to create a [[Facial composite|composite sketch]] of Tsotsi's face, which is then run in the newspapers.  Realizing that he cannot properly care for the baby on his own, Tsotsi spots Miriam ([[Terry Pheto]]), with a young child strapped to her back, collecting water from a public tap.  He follows her to her shack and forces her at gunpoint to feed the kidnapped child. Meanwhile, rich gang leader Fela ([[Zola (entertainer)|Zola]]) begins attempting to recruit Aap, Boston and Butcher to work for him.  When Tsotsi takes the child to Miriam a second time, she asks him to leave the boy with her so that she can care for him on Tsotsi's behalf, and Tsotsi agrees.  Tsotsi decides to take care of the injured Boston, and has Aap and Butcher take Boston to his shack. Boston, who is called Teacher Boy by his friends, explains that he never took the teachers' examination. Tsotsi tells him that the gang will raise the money so that Boston can take the exam, which means they will have to commit another robbery.  Tsotsi and Aap go to Pumla's house. When Pumla's husband John (Rapulana Seiphemo) returns from the hospital, they follow him into the house and tie him up. Aap is assigned to watch John while Butcher ransacks the bedroom and Tsotsi collects items from the baby's room.  When Aap goes to raid the fridge, John activates the [[Burglar alarm|alarm]]. In a panic, Butcher attempts to kill John with John's pistol that he found, but Tsotsi shoots and kills Butcher with his pistol and he and Aap escape in John's car moments before the security company arrives.  Traumatized by Tsotsi's killing of Butcher and fearing that Tsotsi will one day harm him too, Aap decides to leave the gang and quit as Tsotsi's friend. When Tsotsi goes back to Miriam's house she reveals that she knows where he got the baby, and begs him to return the child to his parents.  Tsotsi sets off to return the baby. He reaches John's house, tells John over the [[intercom]] that he will leave the child outside the gate. Meanwhile, an officer stationed at the house alerts Captain Smit ([[Ian Roberts (South African actor)|Ian Roberts]]), who rushes to the scene, arriving just as Tsotsi is about to walk away.  The police train their guns on Tsotsi, ordering him to return the baby. However, John urges them to lower their weapons so that he can retrieve the baby himself. As Tsotsi holds the baby in his arms, John convinces him to give up the baby. Tsotsi emotionally hands the baby to John, then is told to put up his hands and turns himself in as the film ends.  ===Alternate endings=== The film ends with Tsotsi raising his hands, and does not disclose what happens thereafter. Two unused endings were shot for the film, which can be seen on the ''Tsotsi'' DVD. In one, Tsotsi is shot in the shoulder, and while the officers are shocked at what happened, he escapes through a large field back to the Soweto slums after avoiding another shot from the chief police officer. In the other, Tsotsi is shot in the chest while reaching for the baby's milk. He collapses and dies while John and Pumla look on in horror.

TRIP â Remix Your Experience
  In all of the forms in which this [[psychedelia|psychedelic]] work is depicted, the recipient viewer/listener is called upon as the âfinal authorâ to allow their own individual storyline to arise. The basis for the cinematic-musical concept piece is formed by a [[Progressive rock]] piece of music 74 minutes long. The session formation âThe Element Projectâ interprets a variety of human relationships to the environment, to nature and love in English. The spectrum of stylistic tools ranging from Rock to Jazz, Blues, Ethno and on to the avant-garde defines the dramatisation of four different films. *'''artwork''' is a painting performance on the floor which comes about before a bookshelf wall of video films. It tales the tale of a housepainter and how, for him, the fresh paint he applies seems to become a painting that grows larger and larger in the course of his boring work. He encounters a [[mermaid]] thereby, who takes on human form in association with the fairy tale by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], yet is unable to speak and can no longer leave her element. He finds her shyness so appealing that he follows her in her travels, trying time and again to win her affections, until he finally grasps that he will have to adapt himself to her and becomes one with the painting. *'''seamusic''' is a diving excursion to unknown creatures in the underwater world: from macro-footage of plankton to symbiotic relationships and a crab riding rodeo-style on an alga in an underwater storm, all the way to dynamic diving camera sequences of [[moray eels]] on the hunt. Apart from âspeed-upsâ to illustrate the motoric movement of [[sea cucumbers]], all of the shots are genuine documentary film footage of nature. *'''playing planet''' uses [[docufiction]] to juxtapose the relationships of different cultures from 15 countries. The woman who lives in a traditional Sudanese family while working in a scientific laboratory, or the young American woman (Amber Steele) who uses provocative behaviour that deviates from the norm to put herself at a distance to her warfare-conducting homeland. The flight of an Indian couple to enable a marriage based on love, or the struggle to obtain justice for oneself in Haiti. Accounts of a Brazilian voodoo cult and on to the magic of Chinese dragons, of dynamite fishing to sport diving, the joy of having a meal and the kick from a parachute jump. *In '''track 2''', a young woman riding the underground subway explores the thoughts and dreams of her fellow travellers within the tunnel walls. 30 episodes by 30 film-makers in just as many cinematic styles. The range encompasses [[animation]] film, collages, B/W silent film, photo film, art film, karaoke and [[video clips]] in stories about the ceremonial birth of Earth, duelling, love, lost toys, discovering the unknown, [[Barbie]] and Ken, and lots more. As regards the 8 additional video-wall films from the bookshelf wall in âartworkâ, these equally deal with a mimical portrait that interprets the music, two computer animations, two VJ productions and documentary footage of the painting performance, straight through to the musicians involved.

Tweek City
 Eric G. Johnson wrote and directed Tweek City, a film depicting a harrowing week in the life of Bill Jensen (cult actor and filmmaker [[Giuseppe Andrews]]), a young, sexually confused, half-Latino speed-dealer in San Francisco's Mission District.  As the week begins, Bill picks up a bag of speed and starts walking the streets in a desperate attempt to make some money and, more importantly, escape his nightmares. Streetwalking leads to bed-hopping and Bill falls for a one-night stand just long enough to earn, and subsequently, betray her trust. When Bill wakes up from the whole affair in an excretory abyss, his friend Jerm (Keith Brunsmann) provides some support, however Bill fails to express what's truly bothering him.  Just when Bill might open up, Jerm drags him to a punk show, takes an ill-advised stage dive and becomes incapacitated. Left alone, Bill canât cope and he plunges into a speed-induced, downward spiral that takes him on a nocturnal journey through the streets of San Francisco, and ultimately down to Los Angeles, where he crashes his high school sweetheart's wedding. From his sleep-deprived, hallucinogenic state, Bill makes a desperate attempt to reconnect with Sharon ([[Elizabeth Bogush]]), his first, and only, love.

The agent, known as Anwar [[Efendi]], is a master of disguise and has excellent command of Russian.  ===Change from the book=== Unlike the ending of the book, where French correspondent d'Hervais is exposed as being Anwar in disguise, in the film Anwar turns out to have been posing as a seemingly awkward and stupid Russian captain.  In the book, unlike the film, Fandorin did not escape by clinging to the underbelly of a carriage but was actually released by the governor of [[Vidin|Viddin]] Yusuf Pasha after winning a wager.  The scene where Varvara and Fandorin flew in the balloon never took place in the book and Varvara had no role in discovering the weaknesses of the Turkish defenses.  The scene in the cave with the Lieutenant Luntz did not take place in the book. The character of the homosexual Luntz was created for the movie. The homosexual nature of Kazanzaki is never alluded to in the film. In fact, Fandorin was never once shot at by Anwar Effendi in the book.  In the book, the evidence for Colonel Lukan's involvement in treason was found on him and not in his tent like in the film.  Colonel Lukan was killed in a duel whereby sabres were used rather than pistols.  The book refers to three main failed assaults on Plevna. The film shows only two.  In the book, when Fandorin hears about Osman Pasha's plans to 'surrender' he rushes to Sobolev to urge him to attack Plevna and not to the meeting point of the Turkish 'envoys'.  In the film Fandorin went to Istanbul and showed up at the end in Turkish attire. In the book he never went to Istanbul and arrived wearing European clothing.  In the film Fandorin was happy to see his old friend Count Zurov when Zurov first arrived, whereas in the book the Zurov and Fandorin were not close friends and the first meeting in the tent was rather chilly.

Turning Green
 Sixteen-year-old James Powers hates his life in Ireland. Six years prior, he was forced to live with his three aunts after his mother died and his father shipped him and his little brother Pete ([[Killian Morgan]]) off to rural Ireland. There, the bored, depressed and [[wikt:xenophobic|xenophobic]] James drops out of school and spends his days yearning to get back to his idealized [[United States|America]]. For James, getting back to the U.S. is a long and improbable prospect. He tries to make money, little by little, to return to [[New York City]] â making small bar bets and working for the local [[wikt:bookie|bookie]], Bill the Bookie, played by [[Alessandro Nivola]]. When Bill doesn't get the money owed to him, Bill the Breaker is sent in, played by [[Academy Award]] winning actor [[Timothy Hutton]]. Bill the Breaker does exactly the same job as James, only with an added dose of extreme violence. But it's obvious that Bill the Bookie prefers James, and [[wikt:take a shine to|takes a shine to]] the clever and resourceful young man.  James has just two friends. The first is his younger brother Pete, who has assimilated much better to Irish life than his older sibling. Still, James quizzes the 11-year-old on all things American, from [[baseball]] to New York City, yet Pete doesn't have that connection to America that James does. Pete, ever the thoughtful brother, simply goes along with James' obsession. James' other friend is Tom ([[Colm Meaney]]), the [[wikt:gruff|gruff]]-yet-affectionate [[fisherman]] and frequently unsuccessful [[gambler]]. He sells his boat to pay for his gambling debt and in one scene, hands James a [[wikt:wad|wad]] of cash. James has the ability to read between the lines of Tom's grouchy commentary, and sees the good in him. Tom in turn, is a rather faulty father figure to the directionless James.  James also pines for the cutest girl in town, Fiona, who may or may not know he even exists. If he had more confidence, he might approach her, but he keeps his distance. Meanwhile, James' clueless aunts suspect something is wrong with James, based on the inordinate amount of time he spends locked in the bathroom. Of course, what they suspect to be an illness is no mystery to a more informed audience who can more easily determine what interests most 16-year-olds.  In a fortuitous moment, the aunts send James to London for a few days to see a medical specialist. There, he discovers his possible ticket out of Ireland â [[pornography]]. Illegal in Ireland, James strikes a deal with a local London [[wikt:newsagent|newsagent]] to import them to his town and, using his connections made working for Bill, sells them to an eager [[Ireland|Irish]] audience. To pay for them, he uses money that Tom gave him to repay his debt to Bill. This sets up conflict as Bill always demands payment on time.  Upon his return a few days later, James meets up with the two Bills and they discuss business. In the racetrack toilet, Bill the Bookie asks James repeatedly if he had collected any money before he left. James, fully aware that he used Tom's money to buy the magazines, lies and says no. With that, Bill the Breaker suddenly attacks and beats the unsuspecting James. Bill the Bookie knew very well that Tom's money was supposed to come to him, but somehow hadn't. The beating serves as a warning to James to watch his step.  James immediately runs over to Tom's, who has also been beaten up by Bill. Tom banishes James from his house. Now, James is more alone than ever. James fantasizes that one of the girls in the magazine is talking to him, as she [[wikt:cajole|cajoles]] him to sell the magazines and then sell some more. Determined more than ever to pay back Bill, James finally receives his shipment of magazines and sells them all in one day. This leads him to expand his business â from approaching local merchants to selling them to other towns east, west, north and south. Suddenly, business is booming. James feels he's actually helping Ireland, he's liberating them, inspiring them. "Like [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], [[Ãamon de Valera]]. Or that guy from [[Thin Lizzy]]."  As he nears closer and closer to his possible escape from Ireland, his perspective on the place changes. He even seems to be enjoying life for the first time in years. He finally strikes up the nerve to ask Fiona out on a date. He buys Tom a bigger boat. Even the aunts seem more tolerable. Meanwhile, Bill the Bookie has been wondering where this glut of illegal magazines has come from. Learning that the magazines are coming from London, Bill figures out that James is the one who is cutting into his underground business. He's the only one smart enough to do it.  And just as James is about to reverse course on his skewed vision of Ireland, Bill steps in. The two Bills take James to the top of the cliff, which leads to an ironic and wistful conclusion.  
Udayananu Tharam
 Udayabhanu ([[Mohanlal]]) is a hardcore worshipper of films and a talented [[assistant director]], who yearns to write and direct his own film at a time when the industry is filled with dubious filmmakers. Rajappan Thengummoodu ([[Sreenivasan (actor)|Sreenivasan]]) is a rather crooked friend of Udayabhanu and an aspiring and failed actor.  Udayabhanu finally prepares to shoot his first film based on his own script, he discovers to his horror that Rajappan has stolen his manuscript, and filming is underway with Rajappan playing the leading role, which eventually propels him to [[stardom]]. Udhayabhanu soon finds himself faced with a career and personal crisis, with his faltering relations with his actress wife Madhumati ([[Meena (actress)|Meena]]) contributing to the latter.  Later, with the help of producer Babykuttan ([[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]]), Udayabanu prepares to direct another film, but he is forced to cast Rajappan as the hero since he was the star with most market value at that time. Rajappan takes up the offer, since he is also at a plateau of his career, but refuses to co-operate and throws tantrums and causes maximum trouble when possible. He spends most of his time actively flirting with the actresses in the film.  Towards the end of the shoot, using a perceived insult as a ruse, Rajappan leaves the set leaving the film half way with the hope that this will destroy Udayabanu's career for ever. But Udayabanu devises clever tactics and shoots the remaining scenes with Rajappan without him even being aware of it. The sequences depicting these tactics were heavily inspired from the Hollywood hit [[Bowfinger]].  At the end, the film is a critical and box office success, which also saves Rajappan from his damaging career, Rajappan realises his mistakes and admits publicly that Udayabanu is the real star and not himself.  
Typhoon (2005 film)
 An [[United States|American]] freighter ship carrying sensitive cargo en route to [[Taiwan]] is hijacked by North Korean pirates led by Sin ([[Jang Dong-gun]]), a terrorist set on destroying the [[Korean Peninsula]].

He decides to hatch a plan to unleash nuclear grade uranium onto the clouds of a typhoon so that radioactive rain will shower onto the Korean Peninsula, effectively destroying it. He sets out with his group of South East Asian pirates, but he encounters Sejong. In an attempt to lure Sin into their hands, Sejong sets up an appointment for Sin to reunite with his sister. Sin, who had assumed his sister to be dead, believes it to be a farce to lure him out, but he goes anyway. Sin takes the bait and enters the meeting, but Sejong soon discovers that Sin and his sister are more prepared than he had thought. Sin has a sniper set up, who effectively takes out part of Sejong's elite team, though Sin's sister is caught in the crossfire and suffers a bullet wound.  After escaping, Sin sets out to execute his plans of mass destruction. He embarks on a freight carrier that he names "Typhoon" that is filled with balloons carrying canisters filled with uranium. Meanwhile, in a last-ditch effort to save the Korean Peninsula, Sejong gathers a [[Republic of Korea Naval Special Warfare Flotilla|South Korean UDT/SEAL]] team, and helicopters out to sea. He makes a point of picking single men, stating that death is likely. They fly through the impending typhoon to the freight carrier, encountering Sin and his pirates. There is a bloody skirmish and both sides suffer casualties.  Sin is in the lower cabins through most of the fighting, spending time with his sister during her last breaths. The bullet wound is too much and she is about to die. They agree to meet again in the afterlife. Dazed, Sin heads out after she dies and he begins to release his uranium balloons. Having to manually open the hatch to release them, he is able to crank it open a few feet, allowing a few balloons to escape. Before he can activate the balloons with his remote control, Sejong makes his appearance. He is the last man standing, except for Sin, and all the rest of the Special Forces soldiers and Pirates are dead. Sin and Sejong struggle in a fight to the death, which accumulates in Sin's death.  In his last sentiments, Sejong sends a letter to his mother. He believes that in the end, Sin never intended to destroy Korea and that he was just a desperate man who was a product of a tragedy. He is regretful of Sin's death, and says he wouldn't have minded befriending Sin in another life. Sin then carries his sister onto a boat to cross the river of the dead, and they cross over into the afterlife together.

 One year ago, a wild bear stole a calf from Mitch ([[Morgan Freeman]]) and Einarâs ([[Robert Redford]]) ranch. The two friends attempted to save the calf, but the bear viciously attacked Mitch â and because Einar was drunk, he failed to save him from serious injury. The bear escaped into the mountains.  A year later, Mitchâs wounds still cause him constant pain. Einar cares for Mitch daily, giving him morphine injections, food and friendship. He leans his guilt on emotional crutches, while Mitch struggles to walk with real crutches. The bear is later seen foraging for food in town. Sheriff Crane Curtis ([[Josh Lucas]]) captures the bear and the bear ends up in the town zoo. About the same time, Einarâs long-lost daughter-in-law Jean ([[Jennifer Lopez]]) shows up on his doorstep; she is trying to escape from an abusive relationship.  Jean and her daughter, Griff (Becca Gardner), move in with Einar and Mitch. Einarâs son, Griffin, had married Jean years ago. She learned she was pregnant (with Griff) after Griffin died in a car accident. After his death, the family broke up. Tension exists between Einar and Jean because both are still grieving for Griffin. Tensions in the family build as Einar has always blamed Jean for his son's death.  Since Griffin died, Jean has been in a series of unsuccessful relationships. She moved in with Einar to escape her latest abusive boyfriend, Gary ([[Damian Lewis]]). Jean starts working at a local coffee shop to earn money to become independent. There she befriends Nina, another waitress ([[Camryn Manheim]]).  The local sheriff also becomes her friend.  Meanwhile, Gary has tracked Jean down and appears in town. Initially, Einar and the sheriff throw him out of town.  Einar asks Jean to tell him how Griffin died. Jean says they flipped a coin to determine who would drive â she lost. At 3 a.m., the two tired souls had set out on the last leg of a long trip. Jean fell asleep at the wheel. The car flipped six times. Griffin died, but Jean survived. When Einar learns the truth about his son's death, he says theyâll have to talk about Jean moving out. Jean says sheâs through talking. The next morning she takes Griff with her and leaves to stay with Nina.  Nina later ends up helping her understand Einarâs gruff ways and bitterness.  Griff, who has started to build a relationship with her grandfather, leaves her mother and goes back to the ranch alone. Einar meets Jean at the diner and invites her to come back and live with him and Griff after he and the child have had a camping trip.  The "camping trip" is a cover story meant to allow them time to carry out a request from Mitch to set free the bear who handicapped him.  The plan to get the bear into a transport cage does not go well. Griff accidentally knocks the gearshift lever into neutral while Einar is luring the bear into the cage. The bear gets free, and Einar gets injured as he jumps out of the way. Griff drives Einar to the hospital, where he and Jean attempt to reconcile. Back at the ranch, Mitch survives a peaceful confrontation with the bear from his past. It goes into the mountains, where it belongs.  Meanwhile, Gary returns to the area and comes to the ranch the next day to accost Jean. He and Einar have an explosive confrontation that ends in Einar threatening Gary with his rifle, before badly beating him up. We later see Gary, quite battered, put on a bus out of town.  In the final scene, Einar affectionately talks with one of his cats, who throughout the whole story he coldly ignored. Griff invites Sheriff Curtis for lunch when he drops by to see Jean. All is well as Mitch narrates the last seconds of the story, describing to Einar his dreams of flying above the earth and coming to understand things about life.

Unleashed (2005 film)
 Bart ([[Bob Hoskins]]) is a vicious [[loan shark]] whose method of persuading men to pay him back involves Danny the Dog ([[Jet Li]]), a young man trained like a dog and left with the mentality of a child. Danny is a violently skilled fighter who stops at nothing to take down his targets, but only when a metal collar around his neck is removed by Bart. Once the collar is on, Danny is a harmless, withdrawn person, with very little knowledge of how to live as a [[Socialization|socialised]] human, and he is constantly bullied by Bart, whom Danny perceives as his master. One day, Danny meets Sam ([[Morgan Freeman]]), a kind blind pianist, at the antique warehouse while dealing with Bart's clients.  After the collar trick with Danny starts to fail due to its inherent limitations, Bart realizes he can end his loan shark career by entering Danny as a fighter in underground fighting deathmatches. If Danny wins, Bart receives a hefty prize money. However, after the first fight, Bart is attacked by another criminal and is left for dead after being shot by a semi-automatic weapon. A critically injured Danny returns to the antique warehouse for shelter, where he is found by Sam. Danny is unconscious for two days and wakes up at the home of Sam and his stepdaughter Victoria ([[Kerry Condon]]), Danny starts to open up to them starting a new life with the benevolent family. The two teach Danny how to eat, read, speak, cook, go grocery shopping, and how to play the piano. Danny socializes with Victoria and Sam by hanging out with them in public areas and taking family photos. He also drastically changes with new clothes, hairstyle, and fresh lifestyle, and finally learns to live without his collar after Victoria removes it. He is drawn closer to music while spending time with Victoria, and develops curiosity about who his mother was after Victoria teaches him what it means to have a family.  Weeks later Sam informs Danny about moving back to [[New York City|New York]], where he and Victoria are originally from. He invites Danny, telling him they think of him as family, and Danny happily accepts. However, Danny runs into Bartâs right-hand man Lefty in the streets and is forced back to Bart after Lefty threatens to hurt Sam and Victoria. Bart, who is recovering from the accident, drags Danny back to the underground arena, where a death-match is set between Danny and four ruthless martial artists. Despite Dannyâs refusal to fight, Bart shoves him into the pit, where he is attacked bythe fighters while trying to defend himself. He eventually retaliates by beating the four fighters, but refuses to kill them, so Bart kills the first fighter at gunpoint, drags Danny back home, and shuts him back in his cage. That night, Danny sneaks through his door and goes through photographs of Bartâs favorite prostitutes, finally finding one snapshot of who appears to be Dannyâs own mother. He interrogates Bart, who tells him that she was simply a prostitute who is long gone. He angrily promises to make Danny repay him for the money he had lost earlier that evening.  Next morning, Danny manages to escape from Bart by causing the car to crash and goes back to Sam and Victoria, telling them what he has learned and where he was. With the two's help, Danny figures out that his mother was a pianist who had financial problems. As Victoria plays the same music his mother played, Danny regains memories from his childhood past: his mother was a music student with no money, so she offered herself to Bart to get some to pay for her lessons while hiding Danny from him all the time. However, it ended when Bart discovered Danny, causing her to defy Bart and be killed. Bart has been raising Danny ever since, not as a human being, but as a dog. After regaining the memories, he and Victoria try to pack up when a confused Sam returns.  Bart and a large gang of thugs arrive at Sam's apartment building to capture Danny. Danny hides Sam and Victoria in their closet and runs out to fight the thugs. He faces off against The Stranger, an attacker with a skill level similar to his own, but Danny eventually causes him to fall on Bart's car. Bart and his men pursue Danny through the building with guns, finally catching him in Sam's apartment. He threatens to pull the trigger, all the while telling him that he was never meant for a different kind of lifestyle, but he drops the gun and instead takes out a collar, telling Danny to come home. Danny slowly advances toward the collar, but stops Bart at the last minute and disarms him. He proceeds to furiously beat Bart, causing Sam and Victoria to burst out and beg Danny not to kill; however, a defeated Bart orders Danny otherwise. Bart tells Danny he will always be an animal, to which Sam responds by smashing a flower pot on Bart's head, knocking him unconscious. Sam, Danny, and Victoria embrace having calmed Danny's rage. Bart is arrested in the aftermath.   Some time later, Danny is with Sam at a piano recital at [[Carnegie Hall]], where Victoria is getting ready to perform. Realising Victoria is playing what his mother played years ago, Danny sheds a happy tear.  
V for Vendetta (film)
 In 2027, the world is in turmoil and warfare, with the United States fractured as a result of prolonged [[Second American Civil War|second civil war]] and a pandemic of the "St. Mary's Virus" ravaging Europe. The United Kingdom is ruled as a [[Nordicism|Nordic supremacist]]<ref name=":0"></ref><ref name=":1"></ref><ref name=":82"></ref> and [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]]<ref></ref> police state by the [[Norsefire]] Party, helmed by all-powerful High Chancellor [[Adam Susan|Adam Sutler]]. Political opponents, immigrants, Jews, Muslims, atheists, homosexuals, and other "undesirables" are imprisoned and executed in concentration camps. The [[Irish people|Irish]] are not exterminated, but are considered inferior compared to people of [[Nordic race|Nordic]] and [[British people|British]] descent.<ref name=":0" />  On November 4, a vigilante in a Guy Fawkes mask identifying himself as "[[V (comics)|V]]" rescues [[Evey Hammond]], an employee of the state-run British Television Network, from members of the "Fingermen" [[secret police]] while she is out past curfew. From a rooftop, they watch his demolition of London's main criminal court, the [[Old Bailey]], accompanied by fireworks and the "[[1812 Overture]]". Inspector Finch of [[Scotland Yard]] is asked to investigate V's activities while BTN declares the incident an "emergency demolition". V interrupts the broadcast to claim responsibility, encouraging the people of Britain to rise up against their government and meet him on next year's [[Guy Fawkes Night]] outside the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]. During the broadcast, the police attempt to capture V. Evey helps him escape, but is knocked unconscious.  V takes Evey to his home, where she is told she must remain for one year. V then kills Lewis Prothero, Norsefire's chief propagandist, and Anthony Lilliman, the [[Bishop of London]]. Evey offers to help, and uses the opportunity to escape to the home of her boss, comedian and talk show host Gordon Deitrich. In return for Evey trusting him with her safety, Gordon reveals prohibited materials, including subversive paintings, an antique [[Quran]], and homoerotic photographs. Meanwhile, V confronts Dr. Delia Surridge, who had experimented on him and many other "undesirables" 20 years ago at [[Larkhill]] concentration camp; seeing her remorse for her past actions, he kills her painlessly.  After Gordon performs a satire of the government on his show, his home is raided and Evey is captured. She is imprisoned and tortured for information about V, with her only solace being a note written by actress Valerie Page, a former prisoner who was tortured and killed for her lesbianism. Evey is told she will be executed unless she reveals V's location. When she says she would rather die, she is inexplicably released, and then finds herself in V's home. It turns out that V was the one who had "captured" her at Gordon's home, and staged her imprisonment and torture to free her from her fears. The note was real, passed from Valerie to V when he was imprisoned. He also informs her that Deitrich had been executed when the Quran was found in his home. While Evey initially hates V for what he did to her, she realises she has become a stronger person. She leaves him, promising to return before November 5.  Reading the deceased Surridge's journal, Finch learns V is the result of human experimentation and has been targeting the people who detained him. Despite being stonewalled by the government, Finch searches for the true identity of V, tracing him to a [[biological warfare|bioweapons]] program in Larkhill. Finch meets William Rookwood, who tells him that the program, which was directed by Sutler (who was then Undersecretary of Defence), resulted in the creation of the deadly St. Mary's Virus. He further reveals that Creedy, a leader of the Norsefire Party, released the virus onto English soil, killing 100,000 British residents and framing the outbreak as an attack by a [[terrorist organisation]]. The Party, which promised security in times of social instability, used the ensuing wave of fear to elevate Sutler to the newly created office of High Chancellor and win an overwhelming majority in [[British Parliament|Parliament]], becoming the elected government. Finch later discovers that Rookwood was V in disguise, and though he initially disbelieves the story, his faith in the Norsefire government is severely shaken.  As November 5 nears, V distributes thousands of Guy Fawkes masks, and the population questions party rule as the nation slowly descends into anarchy, ignited when one of the Fingermen makes the mistake of shooting and killing a young girl committing vandalism, only to be killed in turn by a mob of enraged citizens. On the eve of November 5, Evey visits V, who shows her an explosive-laden train in the abandoned [[London Underground]], set to destroy Parliament. He leaves it to Evey to decide whether to use it. V meets Party Leader Creedy, with whom he has made a deal to surrender in exchange for Sutler's execution. After Creedy executes Sutler, V reneges on his deal and kills Creedy and his men. Mortally wounded, he returns to Evey and tells her he loves her before dying.  As Evey places V's body aboard the train, she is found by Finch. Disillusioned by the Party's regime, Finch allows Evey to send the train off. On the surface, thousands of unarmed Londoners wearing Guy Fawkes masks march towards Parliament. Since Creedy and Sutler are both dead, the [[British Armed Forces|military]] receives no orders, and allows the crowd to pass. As Parliament is destroyed, Finch asks Evey for V's identity, to which she replies, "He was all of us."

As the investigation goes on, the film turns to a flashback, where it is revealed that Karan used to be Pooja's ex-boyfriend. Karan was brash and good looking, but he was extremely possessive of Pooja because in a fit of rage Karan stabbed a man with a fork and forced Pooja to leave her father ([[Alok Nath]]). This caused Pooja to break up with him.  After the break up, Karan left town and Pooja met a handsome, loving, wealthy man, Rahul. Soon, the two got married and started living a happy married life.

With new developments in the place, the police start suspecting that Pooja's death is not a suicide and that Karan has something to do with it. At Karan's house someone leaves Pooja's jewellery on his drawer. Karan calls his friend Rajat Saxena ([[Rakesh Bedi]]) and tells him that he cannot call Rahul. One night at Rahul's house both Karan and Saxena come over for a drink but Karan plans to put a dangerous syrup in one of the glasses which Saxena accidentally drank.  Karan realizes that somebody is trying to frame him and with Saxena's help he promises that no one will frame him. His only logical suspect is Rahul, but he is unable to understand how and why as Rahul and Karan go to a train track Rahul saves a deaf boy. Karan realizes that Rahul is not blind as both men fight but Karan manages to gunpoint Rahul. Back at Rahul's house Karan falsely believes that he murdered Pooja as Karan jubilantly tape records Rahulâs confession on the stereo but instead Rahul had the remote for the stereo and taped recorded what Karan had told him to say. Angered Karan threatens to shoot Rahul but is stopped by the police and Inspector Khan ([[Rajesh Vivek]]). Meanwhile, the police and Khan  gather enough circumstantial evidence pointing towards Karan. Karan is arrested for the murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in Section 302 Indian Penal Code by the Judge ([[Achyut Potdar]]) and Saxena can no longer be Karan's lawyer . However, Karan manages to bribe a Constable by giving him a wrist watch worth $100000.00 in return the Constable managed to give Karan a tape recorder. That night, Rahul comes to meet Karan who tells him that he knew that Karan did not commit the murderer.  Rahul starts explaining that he had found out that his blindness was curable. For the same purpose, he went abroad and had operation done on himself secretly. Rahul intended to surprise Pooja, but upon his arrival, he found her in Karan's arms. This infuriated him, but he kept quiet. However, later that night, he accidentally made her realize that he can see now. After that, Pooja put two and two together and committed suicide.  Rahul and his servant Alex ([[Veerendra Saxena]]) find an audio cassette recorded by Pooja. In the cassette, Pooja explained the whole story and also told him that while Rahul was on his business trip to Singapore, Pooja sees Karan, who faked an injury to not go to Singapore appeared in the living room. Pooja tells Karan that the reason why she married Rahul was because Pooja had to break her relationship with him. This made Karan act crazy and gets thrown out of the house by Pooja who ran upstairs which Karan had managed to come into the bedroom as he threatened to burn Pooja and Rahul's bedroom but Pooja had no choice but to manage a divorce against Rahul and marriage with Karan. When Karan fell asleep Pooja tried to call Rahul but Karan says that if she tells Rahul about this Rahul will permanently be blind which terrorized her. The next morning Karan managed  divorce papers and was hugging Pooja but was unknown that Rahul had returned from his trip. Rahul now tells to a captive Karan that Pooja did commit suicide, but in his eyes, her death was a murder and Karan, a murderer. Hence, he vowed to make Karan pay by taking matters into his own hands. Rahul tells Karan that he would have taken his revenge by killing Karan but if he did that it would not have brought peace to him, with Alex's help it was him that dropped his sneakers at the beach as proof. Then Rahul starts explaining how he framed Karan. After he is done talking, Karan jubilantly shows him the tape recorder. Rahul tells him that he had anticipated this move and reveals that the tape recorder had no batteries. Realizing that Rahul has succeeded in trapping him, Karan becomes crestfallen, while Rahul remarks that he has fulfilled a promise (made to Pooja) as Karan yells in fear right after Rahul leaves as it was revealed that Saxena had been working with Rahul the entire time. In the end, Rahul is shown immersing Pooja's ashes in the river and Karan sitting in his cell in terror.  
Urban Legends: Bloody Mary
  In 1969, three high school footballers tried to drug and kidnap their prom night dates. Their plan works with two of the girls but the third, Mary Banner (Lillith Fields), tries to escape. The football captain chases her into a storage room and punches her, knocking her out. Unable to revive her nor able to hear her heartbeat, he believes Mary to be dead. Panicking, he locks her body in an old trunk.  Thirty-five years later, in 2004, this story is told among three school girls during a sleep over. One of them, Sam ([[Kate Mara]]), had written an article in the school paper critical of football players' academic achievements and subsequently she, her friends, and her brother David (Robert Vito) are treated as outcasts by the rest of the school. They also jokingly conjure up [[Bloody Mary (folklore)|Bloody Mary]] and the next morning all three are gone. After having been missing for one day, they reappear, waking up in an old deserted mill, with no knowledge of how they got there. While most suspect a hoax on the girls' part, Sam and David suspects that it is a prank by football players.  While Sam is haunted by visions of a dead girl bleeding from her head, several pupils die under mysterious circumstances resembling urban legends; for example, football player Roger (Brandon Sacks) burns in a sunbed, Heather (Audra Lea Keener), girlfriend to football captain Buck (Michael Gregory Coe), has spiders erupting from a swelling on her cheek, driving her to cut her face with a mirror, and football player, Tom (Nate Herd), is electrocuted while urinating on an old electrical fence, his ring finger being bitten or cut off. Buck blames these deaths on the Owens siblings. Before her death, Heather made up with Sam and tried to tell her that this happened before. In her homework, Sam finds notes sent to Heather about the disappearance of Mary Banner and the homecoming kidnappings of 1969, as well as notes referencing the events of the previous films. Browsing the school paper's archives, they find out that Mary was never found, that another victim committed suicide years later and that the third, Grace Taylor (Tina Lifford), still lives in town.  They visit Grace, who claims that Mary, or rather, her "life force", is exacting revenge on the children of the five people involved in the kidnappings but cannot (or will not) reveal the names of the perpetrators. While Sam is prone to believe her, David remains skeptical and thinks that Grace is the killer. While sneaking around in Grace's house, he also found out that Grace produced or collected artwork on Urban Legend and identifies Grace as the originator of the notes sent to Heather. The siblings go to warn Buck, who admits that he and his mates orchestrated Samantha's disappearance and blames her for the death of his friends. He also reveals that his father, the football coach, was one of the kidnappers in 1969 but did not hurt Mary. Sam, however, suspects that the coach was the one that killed Mary as she saw him put flowers on her [[Cenotaph|headstone]] earlier. Her stepfather, who overheard her, tells her to reveal any solid evidence she has.  Meanwhile, an upset Buck tries to relax by drinking and watching a film in a motel. Falling asleep, he wakes up from hearing a dripping sound and discovers the corpse of his dog. He is attacked by Mary, who crawls out from under his bed and kills him with his broken bottle. Different rumours about his death are spread immediately.  Both siblings are trying to find clues about the fifth remaining perpetrator; Sam by browsing through old photographs, David by visiting Grace again. Grace still refuses to reveal the names but directs him to the school archives. Going through the archives, he finds out the identity of the fifth person and rushes home, but finds Sam gone and is suffocated by a hooded man. Sam meanwhile has visions of Mary again, revealing that the girl was not dead when she was locked in the trunk. and that she later awoke, realizing she was buried alive. The visions also reveal to Sam the whereabouts of the trunk. Sam visits Grace, who tells her to find and bury Mary's corpse and reluctantly agrees to drive Sam to the school. While Grace is waiting in the van, Sam finds the storage room and the trunk with Mary's corpse in it  The hooded man also appears and enters the storage room but Sam locks him inside while carrying Mary's remains outside to the van.  Finding Grace unconscious, Sam drives the van to the cemetery, where she begins to dig a grave for Mary under her headstone. Her stepfather, whom Samantha had phoned, also appears and helps her digging but suddenly hits her with the shovel. Suddenly Grace intervenes and tries to fight off Mr. Owens (giving Sam a chance to run) but he eventually knocks Grace out with the shovel. Pursuing his stepdaughter through the graveyard, Bill Owens ([[Ed Marinaro]]) reveals that he was the one that locked Mary in the trunk and that he also killed his stepson (Sam's brother), David. He finally captured her and is about to decapitate her when Mary, in her living form, appears. Smiling towards Sam, she kisses him, then reverts to her ghastly form and drags him with her into the grave.  When Sam wakes up, the grave is surrounded by police and medical personnel retrieving her stepfather's corpse. She and Grace are bandaged and treated for their wounds, and sitting together, console one another. It is announced that Bill Owens has died of a heart attack while trying to dispose Mary Banner's remains.

For the next few days, Felix hears strange noises in the house, and suspects that the man never left. Felix calls the police who are unable to find anything. He then calls Vera and asks her to visit him, eventually resulting in them having sex. But he becomes paranoid when he thinks he hears her talking to someone in the kitchen and accidentally injures her with a knife.  Felix's suspicions are heightened when his neighbour's dog enters the house and appears to hear noises from upstairs too. His neighbour, Mrs Mueller, runs after the dog and appears to be thrown down the stairs, killing her and her dog in the process. The police determine that she merely slipped. Eventually, Felix encounters someone in his house and shoots them, leaving them locked in a room. Felix locks down his house and leaves. He naps in his car until he is awakened by two children who are looking at a picture that Felix drew of the strange man. They identify him as "Martin" and points Felix towards Martin's house.

Eventually, Felix alerts Claudia and Martin's friend Bruno to his presence by breaking a vase and finding a key to the locked basement. Claudia reveals to Bruno that she actually locked Martin in the basement. Felix escapes the house through the basement (in the process taking an injury from Bruno and possibly injuring/killing Bruno and Claudia in turn), which leads to a tunnel where he finds Martin's corpse. The tunnel leads to Felix's own basement. Felix climbs upstairs and discovers that the "man" he shot a few nights ago is actually Vera, who as she lays dying on the floor, reveals she is pregnant.  
Valiant (film)
 In May 1944, 5 years since the declaration of [[World War II]], three Royal Homing Pigeon Service [[war pigeon]]s are flying across the [[English Channel]] with the [[White Cliffs of Dover]] in sight, carrying vital messages to [[Great Britain]]. Despite the poor weather conditions the pigeons have nearly reached their destination. They are, however, suddenly ambushed and attacked by a German enemy [[peregrine falcon]] named General Von Talon ([[Tim Curry]]); two of the pigeons are instantly killed, yet the third, Mercury ([[John Cleese]]), is taken as a [[prisoner of war]].  Elsewhere, a small [[Common Wood Pigeon|wood pigeon]] named Valiant ([[Ewan McGregor]]) is watching an [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] propaganda film in his local bar (an overturned rowing boat) in West Nestington. He is best friends with Felix ([[John Hurt]]), the local barman. Wing Commander Gutsy ([[Hugh Laurie]]), a [[war hero]] flies into the bar, informing everyone that signups are scheduled the next day in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]]. In General Von Talon's lair, Mercury resists [[interrogation]] by his captors. Valiant flies off to London, bidding his mother and Felix goodbye. In London, Valiant meets an unhygienic [[slacker]] pigeon named Bugsy ([[Ricky Gervais]]), who is being hunted by two thugs, after having tricked them at a [[shell game]]. In order to escape the thugs, he signs up with Valiant.  The recruits, Valiant, Bugsy, Lofty ([[Pip Torrens]]), an intellectual red pigeon, and Toughwood and Tailfeather (Dan Roberts and Brian Lonsdale), two muscular but dim-witted twin brothers, form Royal Homing Pigeon Service Squad F, and are sent to a [[recruit training]] facility. Under the command of Sergeant Monty ([[Jim Broadbent]]), who declares that he will toughen them up for the RHPS, the training begins. Meanwhile, Von Talon and his henchmen, Cufflingk ([[Rik Mayall]]) and Underlingk (Michael Schlingmann), try numerous attempts to discover the message's departure location. However Mercury refuses to tell, despite the tortures inflicted upon him, such as irritating him with yodeling music and injecting him with [[truth serum]], before Mercury accidentally reveals the location: Saint-Pierre.  Throughout the training, Valiant develops a crush on Victoria ([[Olivia Williams]]), the camp's nursing dove. Eventually, Gutsy arrives and tells the Sergeant that the recruits need to leave the next morning, despite their training being vastly incomplete. Bugsy, however, decides not to go on the "highly dangerous" mission and flees the camp that night. The next morning, Valiant and the others prepare to leave and start to board the plane headed for [[France]], but not before Bugsy shows up at the last second. The journey quickly becomes dangerous, as the plane is caught in the midst of dogfight. Their plane sustains heavy damage and the pigeons soon have to bail out, in boxes equipped with parachutes. The pigeons are dropped from the plane; however a technical malfunction causes Gutsy's box to fail to deploy. The plane goes down in an inferno of flames, presumably killing Gutsy in the resulting explosion.  In France, the pigeons meet Charles de Girl ([[Sharon Horgan]]) and Rollo (Buckley Collum), two mice from the [[French Resistance]], Mouse Division, who lead them to Saint-Pierre, where they receive the message they have been ordered to deliver. They soon come under attack by Von Talon's henchmen, resulting in Bugsy and the message being captured. Von Talon takes the message from Bugsy and decides to lock him up and kill him later, planning to personally deliver the message to the [[Adolf Hitler|German High Commander]] himself. Valiant and the troops follow Bugsy to the falcon's bunker, where they discover that Gutsy has survived the plane crash. Valiant takes advantage of his small size and sneaks into the bunker through the gun barrel, retrieves the message, and frees Bugsy and Mercury. Unfortunately, the falcons witness the escape and give chase. As Gutsy and the others fight off Von Talon's henchmen, Valiant flies to London to deliver the message, followed by Von Talon.  After a climactic chase by the falcon, Valiant hides in the cottage where he lives, where he is caught by Von Talon again. With the help of Felix and the resident pigeons, Valiant outwits Von Talon by getting a giant hook caught on his medals, leaving him to be beaten by the [[water wheel]]. Valiant delivers the message, and upon receiving it, a change of plans is made; [[Normandy landings|they land in Normandy]]. After receiving the [[Dickin Medal]], Squad F returns to the local bar in West Nestington, where Valiant reunites and shares a romantic kiss with Victoria.

Vampires: The Turning
  For many centuries, the ''phi song neng'' (vampires who have vowed never to drink human blood) have lived among the villages of the Far East. One day over 800 years ago, a young human warlord named Niran fell in love with one of the ''song neng'', a woman named Sang. Niran wanted Sang for his own, so he killed her husband and son. In her pain and rage, Sang attacked and bit Niran during a Songkran ([[New Year]]) solar eclipse, turning him into a vampire.  From Niran's bloodline have come many ''jai tham'' (vampires who drink human blood and kill for pleasure). Only Sang can end the ''jai tham'''s nightly attacks on humans. Doing so, however, will end the entire bloodline and turn every vampire, ''song neng'' as well as ''jai tham'', into mere mortals again. Since the coming Songkran festival will feature the first solar eclipse in 800 years, Sang intends to kill herself by exposing herself to the sun's rays at the end of the eclipse and thus wipe out all the vampires in Thailand.  Connor ([[Colin Egglesfield]]) and Amanda ([[Meredith Monroe]]) are vacationing in Thailand during that year's Songkran festival. Connor, trained since childhood in [[Muay Thai]] (Thai boxing), takes Amanda to see a match. However, Amanda cannot take the brutality and goes back to their hotel alone.  On the way, she gets lost in the Phang Nga market, and Mr Nice Guy (Dom Hetrakul) offers to show her the way to her hotel. He leads her on a short cut down a deserted alley, then turns into the vampire Niran, drinking her blood and carrying her off on a motorcycle. Connor tries to follow, but he is stopped by another vampire, obviously intent on killing him. Just as the vampire is about to succeed, a bald-headed man appears and chops off the vampire's head. Connor begs for his help finding Amanda, but he warns Connor to leave Thailand immediately and threatens to kill Connor if he follows him. Connor stealthily follows Kiko (Roger Yuan) home to Kong Sai House.  When the police refuse to consider Amanda missing until 48 hours have passed, Connor goes back to Kong Sai House, only to find everyone asleep. While snooping through the house, Connor is attacked by Sang (Stephanie Chao). Connor gets away from her by jumping out a window. As Connor lands on the ground below, he is stopped by vampire slayer Raines ([[Patrick Bauchau]]) who insists on testing Connor's blood to see if he is infected. When Connor comes up clean, he begs Raines to help him find Amanda but, like Kiko, Raines warns him to leave Thailand. Amanda is as good as dead, Raines says. If she resists, the ''jai tham'' will bleed her dry; if not, they'll turn her, and then Raines will slay her (he gets $10,000 for every vampire he kills).  Connor won't accept it and returns again to Kong Sai House. While there, he sees a photo of Niran in front of the Techno Games Arcade near the Phang Nga market. Figuring that Niran might have taken Amanda there, he snoops around. He finds Amanda being held in a cell with skeletons, carcasses, and other humans in various stages of having their blood drained. Amanda and Connor escape, but are attacked outside by two ''jai tham'' on a motorcycle. One drives off with Amanda; the other stays to kill Connor. Just as Niran and the rest of the ''jai tham'' arrive, Sang appears. Connor grabs a motorcycle, and with Sang riding behind him they succeed in outrunning the ''jai tham''.  Both Amanda and Connor are now faced with decisions. Amanda must decide whether to allow Niran to turn her or to keep on drinking from her, which causes acute pain. Connor has to decide whether or not to join the ''song neng'' in hopes of winning the battle with the ''jai tham'' and helping Sang to kill herself so that all vampires (including him) will be turned back into mortals. The alternative, if Sang is not successful, is that Connor will remain a vampire until the next Songkran eclipse rolls around in 800 years and Sang can try again. Connor's decision is made doubly hard because he is attracted to Sang. Amanda decides to continue resisting, and Connor decides to become ''song neng''.  The day of the eclipse is upon them. Since Sang's embrace of the sun must take place in the same spot where the curse began 800 years ago (a couple blocks away), the ''song neng'' have made a deal with Raines. Raines and his slayers will line the buildings and walls that overlook the site, which looks like an archeological dig, in order to kill any ''jai tham'' who try to stop Sang. Connor, Kiko, and the rest of the ''song neng'' will help Sang get to the required spot. The eclipse starts at 3:00, and they will have 17 minutes to do the job.  The ''jai tham'' arrive on their motorcycles. In the melee that follows, Connor and Niran fall through a weak spot into a pit where they continue fighting. Time is running out, and Kiko realizes that the slayers have double-crossed them. The slayers open fire, shooting everyone, both ''song neng'' and ''jai tham''. Only Connor and Niran remain protected in their hole. Connor manages to impale Niran, but when he surfaces from the pit, Connor finds only bodies. He shouts for Sang, but there is no answer. Raines walks up, gloating over how much he will get for all the vampire heads AND those in the future. If Sang ends the curse, he explains, there's no more vampires, and he's in the vampire hunting business.  Connor locates Sang as Raines turns his crossbow on her. Connor offers to shoot Sang so that she does not have to suffer. Raines hands his bow to Connor. Connor aims at Sang but suddenly swings his aim to Raines. Forcing Raines to carry Sang to the designated spot, Connor gives her one last kiss before the sun reappears. She explodes, taking Raines with her. Connor hurries back to the ''jai tham'''s base and rescues Amanda.

Ray cannot enter the house because the house has been blessed with voodoo spells.  As the others panic inside, they look and it seems as if Ray is gone.

Eric and Eden then try to pass through the swamp to escape Ray, who dives beneath the murky water. As Eric and Eden head for dry land, Ray attacks, missing them both, but separating them. Eden ends up in the graveyard, and Eric deeper in the swamp. Eden makes her way into a crypt where she finds an altar and an open casket where all the victims are kept. Eden tries to leave but Ray comes and locks her in. In panic, Eden hides beneath Patty's body. Eric is then thrown into the crypt by Ray, who then goes to the altar. Eden starts to cry until Eric opens his eyes.  Eden can not hide her gasp, unknowingly drawing Ray's attention. As Ray looks in to inspect the bodies, he grabs Eden's foot, but Eric begins to groan to protect Eden. Ray then stabs Eric in the head with a screwdriver. Eden then fights Ray by setting him on fire and pushing him down a chute, but he drags her with him. She then uses a charm she got from CeCe that protects against evil. Ray submits, but the snakes possessing his body emerge to try to take the charm from her. Eden escapes up the chute, using the charm as a diversion. Eden then traps Ray and the snakes in the chute. As she tries to drive off in his tow truck, she hears an inhuman shriek, signaling Ray is back. Ray chases Eden out of the truck before she can do anything and she runs to hide in the bayou. She hides behind a bush close to Ray. He hears a rustling and hacks the bush, revealing she is not there.

The band begins touring as Johnny Cash and the [[The Tennessee Three|Tennessee Two]]. On tour, Johnny meets [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]], with whom he falls in love. Cash begins spending more time with June, who divorces her first husband, [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]]. After his attempt to woo June fails, Cash starts abusing drugs and alcohol. After his behavior reaches a bottom during a performance with June, they separate.  Later, over Vivian's objections, Johnny persuades June to come out of semi-retirement, and tour with him. The tour is a success, but backstage, Vivian becomes critical of June's influence. After one performance in [[Las Vegas]], Johnny and June sleep together. The next morning, she notices Johnny taking pills, and doubts her choices. At that evening's concert, Johnny, upset by June's apparent rejection, behaves erratically, and eventually passes out on stage. June disposes of Johnny's drugs, and begins to write "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]", describing her feelings for him and her pain at watching him descend into addiction.  Returning to [[California]], Cash travels to [[Mexico]] to purchase more drugs, and is arrested. Cash's marriage to Vivian implodes; the pair divorce and Cash moves to [[Nashville]] in 1966. Trying to reconcile with June, Johnny purchases a large house near a lake in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee|Hendersonville]]. His parents and the extended Carter family arrive for [[Thanksgiving]], at which time Ray dismisses his son's achievements and behavior. After the meal, June's mother encourages her daughter to help Cash. He goes into detox and wakes with June; she says they have been given a second chance. Though not married, the two begin spending most of their time with each other.  Cash discovers that most of his fan mail is from prisoners, who are impressed with his outlaw image. He proposes to [[Columbia Records]] that he will record an [[At Folsom Prison|album live inside Folsom Prison]]. Despite Columbia's doubts, Cash says that he will perform, and his label can use the tapes if they wish. At the Folsom Prison concert, Cash says that he has been sympathetic to prisoners, explaining that his arrest for drug possession helped him to relate to them. With this success, Cash embarks on a tour with June and his band. On the bus, he stops to talk with June and proposes to her, but she turns him down. At the next concert, June says she will only speak with him on stage. Cash later performs "Ring of Fire" on stage. After the song, Cash invites June to a duet and stops in the middle, saying he cannot sing "[[Jackson (Johnny Cash and June Carter song)|Jackson]]" any more unless June agrees to marry him. June accepts and they share a passionate embrace on stage.

  Tottington Hall's annual [[Unusually shaped vegetable|giant vegetable competition]] is approaching with the coveted Golden Carrot as its prize. Wallace and Gromit provide a humane [[pest control]] business, "Anti-Pesto", protecting the townspeople's vegetables. One morning, Wallace devises a plan to lose weight and creates the Mind Manipulation-O-Matic to transmit the rabbits' appetite for vegetables out of their minds and into his. The machine malfunctions and Gromit destroys it to protect Wallace; however, the transfer appears to have worked, as the test rabbit shows no interest in vegetables. They name the rabbit Hutch while Wallace begins rebuilding the device.  That night, a giant rabbit devours many of the town's vegetables. Wallace suspects that Hutch may be the were-rabbit and locks him in a high-security cage. At a town meeting, Victor Quartermaine the hunter offers to shoot the were-rabbit, but Lady Tottington persuades the townsfolk to continue with Anti-Pesto's services. After following the were-rabbit, Gromit discovers that Wallace is the monster. Victor, who seeks to woo Lady Tottington, corners Wallace at night. Wallace transforms into the were-rabbit under the light of the full moon and bounds away. Gromit lures Wallace home to protect him. Victor obtains three "24-[[carat (purity)|carrot]]" [[Silver bullet|gold bullets]] from the town reverend to use against Wallace.  At the contest, Gromit convinces Wallace that he is the were-rabbit, and Wallace hides himself away. Lady Tottington, who has come to like Wallace, visits and tells him about Victor's plan. When the moon rises, Wallace begins to transform and shoos Lady Tottington away. Victor arrives and fires on Wallace with the golden bullets. Gromit creates a distraction to allow Wallace, as the were-rabbit, to escape; the hunter gives chase to the competition. Gromit begins working with Hutch, who has developed Wallace-like traits, and plans to use his giant [[Cucurbita|marrow]] as bait to lure Wallace to safety.  Wallace, as the were-rabbit, creates chaos at the fair. Victor grabs the Golden Carrot trophy to use as ammunition. Wallace carries Lady Tottington atop Tottington Hall, where she discovers Wallace's connection to the were-rabbit. Victor gives chase, revealing that he only wants to impress Lady Tottington for her money. When Gromit arrives, Victor's dog Philip engages him in a [[dogfight]] in aeroplanes taken from a fairground attraction. Gromit sends Philip's plane to the ground, then steers his plane into Victor's line of fire as Victor fires at Wallace. Wallace jumps, grabs Gromit and sacrifices himself to cushion their fall into a cheese tent.  Victor gloats about his victory, but Lady Tottington hits him with her giant carrot and he falls into the tent too. Gromit quickly disguises Victor as the were-rabbit and the mob of townspeople chase him away. Wallace transforms back to his human self and appears dead, but Gromit uses some [[Stinking Bishop cheese]] to bring him around. Lady Tottington awards Gromit the Golden Carrot and converts the grounds of Tottington Hall into a habitat for Hutch and the other rabbits.

Waiting... (film)
 The film focuses on several characters. One of the main protagonists, Dean ([[Justin Long]]), has been a waiter at a restaurant called Shenaniganz for four years since graduating from [[high school]], and has not earned a degree during his four years at a [[community college]]. When Dean learns from his mother that a former high school classmate, Chett (Travis Resor), now has a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[electrical engineering]], he begins to rethink his direction-less life.  Dean's friend and co-worker, Monty ([[Ryan Reynolds]]), is in exactly the same situation, but has accepted that his future lies with the restaurant. Monty is put in charge of training Mitch ([[John Francis Daley]]), a newly hired waiter who is constantly interrupted throughout most of the film before he can speak, usually by Monty. Also working with Dean is Calvin ([[Robert Patrick Benedict]]), a hopeless romantic who [[Paruresis|cannot urinate in public]], and Dan ([[David Koechner]]), the uptight manager who is grooming Dean as his protÃ©gÃ©. Rounding out the staff are 17-year-old hostess Natasha ([[Vanessa Lengies]]), abrasive waitress Naomi ([[Alanna Ubach]]), waitress (and Monty's ex-girlfriend) Serena ([[Anna Faris]]), Dean's girlfriend and fellow waitress Amy ([[Kaitlin Doubleday]]), stoner busboys T-Dog and Nick ([[Max Kasch]] and [[Andy Milonakis]]), head chef Raddimus ([[Luis GuzmÃ¡n|Luis Guzman]]), the [[insane]], unsanitary chef Floyd ([[Dane Cook]]), lesbian bartender Tyla ([[Emmanuelle Chriqui]]), and the pensive and philosophical dishwasher Bishop ([[Chi McBride]]).   The waiters preoccupy themselves with endless gossip, complaining about the customers, seeking covert revenge on particularly rude or annoying patrons, and playing a special kind of game which involves flashing genitalia at a fellow worker (the "Penis Showing Game"). Each employee has his or her own problems and stories, which are interwoven with the ebb and flow of business. A common phrase used throughout the film, which is referred to in the Shenaniganz training video is "The only thing different between extraordinary and ordinary, is that little bit of extra!" This phrase is mocked by many of the wait staff during the film.  Minutes before the restaurant closes, however, Chett and his girlfriend come in for dinner and leave Dean a hefty tip out of pity. This prompts Dean to quit his job&mdash;turning down an assistant manager position Dan offered him at the beginning of the film&mdash;to seek a more promising future.  When the shift ends, the staff head to a party at Monty and Dean's house. At the party, Monty - who has a predilection for [[ephebophilia|sleeping with teenage girls]] - is able to resist having sex with Natasha, although he says they will have sex the following Wednesday, when she will be 18. Calvin attempts to fix his relationship problems, and Mitch finally speaks, calling out his coworkers on their problems and quitting. He concludes by giving them all ''The Goat'' from the "Penis Showing Game", which Raddimus had told him earlier would instantly grant him god-status. Sure enough, Monty swears his undying allegiance to Mitch, telling Dean he's been "replaced." The film ends with the staff talking about the incident with Mitch, and Dan showing up at a disgruntled customer's house after Natasha gave him the wrong address to the party on purpose.

War of the Worlds (2005 film)
  An opening narration based on the opening of Wells' novel explains that humans were unaware that a race of extraterrestrials was making plans to occupy Earth.  Ray Ferrier is a divorced [[crane operator]] [[longshoreman]] who works at a dock in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and lives in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]]. Ray is estranged from his children. His former wife, Mary Ann, later drops off the children, 10-year-old daughter Rachel and teenage son Robbie, at Ray's house on her way to visit her parents in [[Boston]]. Unexplained changes in the weather occur, with lightning that strikes multiple times in the middle of an intersection and disrupts all electricity.  Ray joins the crowd at the scene of the lightning strikes, where a massive "[[Fighting machine (The War of the Worlds)|Tripod]]" war machine emerges from the ground and uses powerful weaponry to destroy the area, disintegrating most of the witnesses into a grey dust and leaving only their empty clothes behind. Ray collects his children, steals a car that had just been repaired, and drives to Mary Ann's empty home in suburban New Jersey to take refuge. The next morning, he finds that a [[Boeing 747]] has crashed in the street. A news team scavenging for food and surveying the wreckage explain that there are multiple Tripods that have attacked major cities including [[New York City]], [[Paris]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[London]], and have [[Force field (fiction)|force shields]] to protect them from human weapons. They also explain the Tripods' pilots traveled to Earth within the lightning as a way to enter their war machines, which had been buried here millions of years before. Ray decides to take the kids to [[Boston]] to be with their mother. The three are forced to abandon their car after a mob sees that it's working and swarms the vehicle. They later survive a Tripod attack which causes a [[Hudson River]] ferry to sink. During a desperate battle between [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] and the aliens, Ray is forced to choose between being separated from Rachel and preventing Robbie from joining the fight: he lets Robbie go with the Marines, to what appears to be certain death. While escaping, Ray and Rachel are offered shelter in the basement of a farmhouse by a man named Harlan Ogilvy.  The three remain undetected for two days, even as a probe and a group of aliens themselves explore the basement. They discover that the aliens are cultivating a strange red-colored growth (known as "[[Red weed]]") across the landscape and it is quickly spreading, covering trees and making its way into the basement: the group deduces the aliens are modifying Earth to be more like their home planet. The next morning, Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown after witnessing a Tripod harvesting human blood and [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] to fertilize the alien vegetation. Convinced that Ogilvy's mad shouting will alert the Martians to their location, Ray reluctantly kills him. The basement hideout is eventually exposed when a second probe catches the Ferriers sleeping. Rachel is abducted by a nearby Tripod and Ray allows himself to be abducted as well, after picking up a belt of [[Fragmentation grenade|grenades]] from an abandoned military vehicle. Ray and a number of other abductees use the grenades to destroy the Tripod from within, freeing them all.  Ray and Rachel arrive in a devastated Boston, where they discover the alien vegetation is shriveling up and most of the Tripods have collapsed. When an active Tripod appears, Ray notices birds landing on it, indicating that its shields are offline. Ray alerts the soldiers escorting the fleeing crowd, and they shoot it down with [[anti-tank missile]]s. As the soldiers advance on the downed Tripod, a hatch opens and a sickly alien struggles halfway out before dying. Ray and Rachel reach Mary Ann's parents' house, where they are reunited with Mary Ann and Robbie, who is alive after all.  A closing narration explains that the aliens' immune systems could not handle the countless billions of [[microbes]] that inhabit the Earth, and that humanity has "earned" the right to the planet by virtue of naturally coexisting with the rest of its biosphere.

Water (2005 film)
 The film is set in the year 1938, when India was still under British occupation. Child marriages were common practice and widows had a diminished position in society.  Chuyia ([[Sarala Kariyawasam]]) is an eight-year-old girl, whose husband suddenly dies. In keeping with traditions of widowhood, she is dressed in a white sari, her head is shaven and she is left in an ashram, to spend the rest of her life in renunciation. There are fourteen women who live in the dilapidated house, sent there to expiate bad [[karma]], as well as to relieve their families of financial and emotional burdens of caring for widows. The ashram is ruled by Madhumati ([[Manorama (Hindi actress)|Manorama]]), a pompous lady in her 70s. Her only friend is the pimp, Gulabi ([[Raghuvir Yadav]]), a [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] who keeps Madhumati supplied with [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. The two also have a side business: Gulabi helps Madhumati prostitute Kalyani ([[Lisa Ray]]), a beautiful young widow, by taking her across the lake to customers. Kalyani was forced into prostitution as a teenager to support the ashram.  Shakuntala ([[Seema Biswas]]) is perhaps the most enigmatic of the women. She is attractive, witty and sharp. She is also one of the few widows who can read. She exudes enough anger that even Madhumati leaves her alone. Shakuntala is caught between being a God-fearing, devout Hindu, and her hatred of being a widow. She seeks the counsel of Sadananda ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]), a priest, who makes her aware of her unjust and unholy situation. She becomes attached to Chuyia because she sees herself reflected in the little girl; she strives to give Chuyia what she lacked.  Chuyia is convinced that her stay is a temporary one, and that her mother will come to take her away, and so quickly adapts to her new life. She befriends Kalyani, who is more full of life than the other widows. She is witness of Kalyani's budding romance with Narayan ([[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]), a charming upper-class follower of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Despite her initial reluctance, Kalyani eventually buys into his dream of marriage and a new life in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. She agrees to go away with him.  Her plan is disrupted when Chuyia inadvertently blurts about the secret affair to Madhumati. Enraged at losing a source of income and afraid of the social disgrace, Madhumati locks Kalyani up. Much to everyone's surprise, the God-fearing Shakuntala lets Kalyani out to go meet Narayan, and he ferries her across the lake to take her to his home. The journey however, does not culminate in the happy ending that Kalyani had hoped for, as she recognises Narayan's bungalow, and it turns out that Narayan is the son of one of the men whom she has been pimped out to. In shock, she demands that he take her back. A confrontation with his father reveals to Narayan the reason of Kalyani's behavior. Disgusted, he decides to walk out on his father and join [[Mahatma Gandhi]] ([[Mohan Jhangiani]]). He arrives at the ashram to take Kalyani with him, only to find out that Kalyani has fatally drowned herself due to disillusionment and grief.  Madhumati sends Chuyia away to be prostituted as a replacement for Kalyani. Shakuntala finds out and tries to prevent the worst, but she is too late. As a result of being raped, Chuyia is deeply traumatised and catatonic. Cradling Chuyia, Shakuntala spends the night at the shore. Walking through town with Chuyia in her arms she hears about Gandhi being at the train station, ready to leave town. She follows the crowd to receive his blessing. As the train is departing, in an act of despair, Shakuntala runs along the train, asking people to take Chuyia with them. She spots Narayan on the train and gives Chuyia to him. The train departs, leaving teary-eyed Shakuntala behind, taking Chuyia into a brighter future.

As he becomes more and more [[dysthymia|depressed]], Dave takes up [[archery]], finding the activity a way to build his focus and calm his nerves.  David later remembers a conversation between himself and his father, where his father explains to him that "the hardest thing to do and the right thing to do are often the same thing" and that "nothing that has meaning is easy". David appreciates this advice but struggles to implement it.     To prove himself to his father and possibly reconcile with Noreen ([[Hope Davis]]), his estranged wife, Dave pursues a weatherman position with a national talk show called ''Hello America''. The job would nearly quadruple his salary, but means relocating to [[New York City]].  When ''Hello America'' invites him to New York, he takes his daughter, Shelly (Gemmenne de la PeÃ±a), with him and bonds with her by helping her shop for a more suitable wardrobe.  While away, Dave learns that his son Mike ([[Nicholas Hoult]]) attacked his [[Licensed Professional Counselor|counselor]], Don Bowden ([[Gil Bellows]]), claiming that the man wanted to perform [[Fellatio|oral sex]] on him.  Despite this stress and an all-night drinking binge, Dave impresses the ''Hello America'' interviewers and is eventually offered the job.  When he returns, Dave slaps Russ ([[Michael Rispoli]]), Noreen's boyfriend, when he finds him dealing with his son's predicament. Dave later confronts the counselor at his home, beating him up and warning him that he is in store for worse.  The family holds a [[living funeral]] for Robert (organised by Dave's mother, Lauren, played by [[Judith McConnell]]), in which Dave asks Noreen to reconcile and move to New York, but she has decided to marry Russ. Dave and Robert have one final talk, in which Dave breaks down in tears, unsure of his life's choices. Robert consoles him, telling him that he has time to "chuck" the garbage of his life. Robert dies soon after.   The film ends several months later, after Dave has accepted the job and moved to New York.  People have ceased throwing things at him though, he muses, this may be a pleasant side-effect of his archery hobby, for which he carries a bow.  
Welcome to Dongmakgol
 In September 1950, during the Korean War, a [[United States Naval Aviator|U.S. Navy pilot]] named Neil Smith (Steve Taschler) is caught in a mysterious storm of butterflies and crash-lands his plane in a remote and mountainous part of Korea. He is found by villagers from the nearby mountain village of Dongmakgol, who nurse him back to health. Dongmakgol is cut off from the outside world â its inhabitants have no knowledge of modern technology and are blissfully unaware of the massive conflict raging across Korea. Smith hands a Korean-English primer to Teacher Kim (Jo Deok-hyeon), the village scholar, in an effort to communicate, but Mr Kim effectively gives up when Smith begins a barrage of complaints after being asked in English, "How are you?" as an introductory greeting.  Meanwhile, not far from the village, a platoon of North Korean soldiers is ambushed by a South Korean unit, and the ensuing skirmish leaves most of the North Koreans dead.  The surviving North Korean soldiers manage to escape through a mountain passage. The North Korean soldiers, Rhee Soo-hwa ([[Jung Jae-young]]), Jang Young-hee ([[Im Ha-ryong]]), and Seo Taek-gi ([[Ryu Deok-hwan]]) are found by an absent-minded girl from Dongmakgol, named Yeo-il ([[Kang Hye-jung]]). She leads them to the village where, to the North Koreans' alarm, they find two South Korean soldiers, Pyo Hyun-chul ([[Shin Ha-kyun]]) and Moon Sang-sang (Seo Jae-kyung). The South Korean soldiers, both of whom had deserted their units and escaped into the mountains, had also been led to Dongmakgol by another villager.  The unexpected encounter triggers a Mexican standoff that lasts several days. Initially, the villagers are rounded up between the North and South Koreans, but having no idea what the fuss is about they slowly drift away to go about their own business (despite some of the soldiers' efforts to intimidate them into submission). The villagers, who are unfamiliar with the soldiers' weapons, continue to watch on the sidelines and wonder why the two sides are waving "sticks" and "painted potatoes" at each other (which are actually rifles and grenades, respectively). In fact, Yeo-il gleefully pulls out the pin from Taek-gi's grenade (mistaking it for a ring), sending the soldiers into further panic.  The confrontation ends only when Taek-gi, worn by fatigue, accidentally drops his now-armed grenade. While everyone else ducks for cover, Hyun-chul heroically throws himself onto the grenade, but it does not explode. Believing it to be a dud, he throws the grenade behind him in contempt, and it rolls into the village storehouse. It then explodes, incinerating the village's stockpile of corn for the winter. The remnants fall down from the sky, surrealistically, as popcorn.  The two groups of Korean soldiers are now forced to face the fact that their quarrel has condemned the village to starvation in the upcoming winter. They reluctantly agree to a truce and divert their efforts to making up for the damage they have caused. Together, the soldiers undertake work across the village, and help harvest potatoes in the fields.  They even work together to kill one of the wild boars troubling the village. The villagers then bury the boar, much to the annoyance of the soldiers (who wanted to eat it). Both the North and South Korean soldiers and Smith sneak out separately at night to dig up the boar and eat it, leading to an unplanned meal together. The mood is awkward at first, but the tension between the soldiers lessens as they share the meal with each other. However, even afterwards, members of both sides remain haunted by the memories of the terrible things they have experienced during the war.  While this is happening, Allied commanders, having lost several other planes in the area, prepare a rescue team to recover Smith, who they mistakenly believe has been captured by enemy units and is being held at a hidden mountain base. The plan is to secure Smith and evacuate him from the area, with a bomber unit flying in after Smith's extraction to destroy the anti-aircraft guns they presume are located in the base.  The rescue team, led by their commander (David Joseph Anselmo), drops in by parachute at night. They suffer heavy casualties after being swarmed by a torrent of butterflies in the air, with further casualties from the rough terrain. Meanwhile, the villagers and soldiers are holding a harvest feast. The rescue team enter the village, and, assuming it is a cover for an enemy base, begin roughing up toward the villagers. Despite the efforts of the villagers to conceal the Korean soldiers by disguising them as villagers, a firefight breaks out in which all but one of the members of the rescue team are killed, and Yeo-il is fatally wounded in the crossfire. The only survivor of the rescue team, the Korean translator, is hit over the head by Smith and is captured by the villagers.  Through the translator, the people in the village find out about the bombing plan. The North and South Korean soldiers realize that the village is in peril and that there is no time for Smith to make it back to his base to stop the bombing. They decide that the only possible way to save the village is to create a decoy "enemy base" away from the village, using equipment salvaged from another plane that went down nearby. They plan to engage the unit only far as is necessary to divert it and have it bomb the "base" instead of Dongmakgol, with the soldiers fleeing to safety.  Smith is sent back along with the translator so that he can tell the Americans that there is nothing in the village to bomb, in case they decide to send more bombers. Meanwhile, while preparing to engage the planes passing over, Taek-gi encourages the group and quips that they, being a joint North-South troop, are "Allies" too. The decoy is successful, but Young-hee and Sang-sang are killed during the initial engagement. In the end, the remaining Korean soldiers are wiped out by a blanket of bombs â however, they die smiling, knowing that Dongmakgol has been saved.  Smith breaks down in tears on the way to his base upon hearing the bombs in the distance, suspecting that the Korean soldiers have sacrificed themselves. After the bombing, at the site of the destroyed decoy base, butterflies apparate where the Korean soldiers died, which then join the swarm fluttering overhead.  
Wedding Campaign
 Hong Man-taek is a 38-year-old bachelor who at his age is still unable to meet eyes with a woman. Whenever his mother complains "Never had luck with men, never had luck with sons," he feels guilty about not having found a bride yet. Man-taek's old friend Hee-chul thinks he is a lady killer, but he's only a bit more experienced than his basket case friend. Urged on by his grandfather, the two bachelor buddies embark on a matchmaking journey to [[Uzbekistan]] to find wives. The trip to Uzbekistan begins with anxiety and hope. While Hee-chul musters all his suaveness and broken English to appeal to the women, Man-taek gets rejected again and again. Even more frustrated than Man-taek himself is Lara, their matchmaker-cum-interpreter. There is a special reason why she must find a bride for Man-taek, and she decides to give special private lessons on language and manners to achieve their common goal.  
West Bank Story
 The film begins with a scene in which the Palestinians and Jews are both snapping their fingers, similar to the opening scene of ''[[West Side Story]]''. The two parties head to their own family-owned falafel stands (Hummus Hut and Kosher King) where they sing "Our People Must Be Fed/Our People Must Be Served". During the day, Hummus Hut employee Fatima and Kosher King relative David are daydreaming about each other (in the romantic duet, "When I See Him"). When Fatima rushes to give a customer his forgotten leftovers, she has a chance encounter with David, and they realize their mutual attraction.  Upon returning to the shop, Fatima's brother shows her that the Kosher King Jews have a machine that encroaches a few inches onto their property. The head of Hummus Hut throws a rock into the machine, making it malfuncton, provoking a standoff between the two families (resolved by David and Fatima). Ariel, head of the Kosher King, decides he is going to build a wall. After they leave, David and Fatima stay, and David plans to come to her balcony tonight.  The construction begins, and the Palestinians plan to end it abruptly ("We're Gonna Build It"). As such happens, David goes to Fatima's house ("This Moment Is All We Have"), wanting to kiss her, but Fatima refuses, saying it will only escalate the conflict. They head over to stop the fight. As they do, it is revealed to Fatima's family that they are in love. The following fight tips over a canister of gasoline, causing the entire stand to catch fire. David goes to warn the Israelis, who celebrate - until an ember reaches the Kosher King, which proceeds to catch on fire. As the Hummus Hut denizens celebrate, Fatima points out to everyone that they are only making their lives worse.  The next morning, expectant falafel customers are oblivious to the fire, and still want food. Ahmed and Ariel have nothing, but David and Fatima scrape together some of the remaining food, merging the two falafel stands. After the others are working, David and Fatima kiss. At the very end, Fatima asks what will happen if their families cannot stop fighting. David says he will "take you to a place called... [[Beverly Hills]]", alluding to the song "[[Somewhere (song)|Somewhere]]" in ''West Side Story''.

What Iva Recorded
 Iva (Mati Prodan) lives in a middle-class family in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. She receives a digital [[camcorder]] as a present for her 14th birthday, which she uses to film the events in the family apartment during the rest of the day. The film is shown from the perspective of her camcorder. Her mother, Å½eljka (Å ovagoviÄ-Despot), is a perfectionist housewife who deals with her problems by drinking. BoÅ¾o (GregureviÄ), Iva's father, is a dimwitted entrepreneur who likes to bark out commands to the family members, but is a [[sycophant]] at work. He organises a family dinner to invite his business partner, a German named Hoffman (Menrad), to negotiate a big business deal, Iva's birthday being a handy excuse to do so.  Darko (Svrtan), Iva's happy-go-lucky uncle, arrives and is fascinated by the camcorder. Nobody in the house can communicate with Hoffman as nobody speaks German, so Darko invites a friend, Nina (PrpiÄ), who is purportedly a polyglot. She charms Hoffman, but the family is shocked to discover that she is actually an [[escort agency|escort lady]]. Å½eljka begins to show open animosity towards her, while BoÅ¾o accepts it much more stoically. When Å½eljka accidentally spills the family dinner on Nina's clothes, the group decides to visit a restaurant. Hoffman has a good time at the restaurant and shows sexual interest in Å½eljka; BoÅ¾o ignores this. Nevertheless, when he discovers Hoffman gave her the number of his hotel room, BoÅ¾o angrily takes off after him. He is too late, as Hoffman has already left in a taxi. Exhausted, the family returns home late in the evening and Iva turns off the camcorder.  
Where the Truth Lies
 In 1957, immediately after co-hosting a 39-hour-long [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] telethon in a [[Miami]] television studio, entertainers Lanny Morris and Vince Collins fly north to open the new showroom of a [[New Jersey]] hotel run by mobster Sally Sanmarco, who has intimidated them into appearing in order to improve his own image. In their New Jersey hotel suite, shortly after their arrival, the nude body of Miami college student Maureen O'Flaherty is found in a bathtub.  Maureen, an aspiring journalist working for the summer as a server at the comedy team's Miami hotel (which is also owned by Sanmarco), had been researching an article for her school newspaper on the comedy team, and had interviewed them in Miami just before she disappeared. Police investigation in no way connects either Morris or Collins to Maureen's death, which is officially attributed to a drug overdose. Soon after her body is discovered, the two men's comedy partnership is dissolved, despite their enormous success and the closeness of their dependence on one another.  Many unanswered questions remain for the investigators of Maureen's death; the most confusing aspect is how Maureen's body made it from Miami to New Jersey at the same time the comedians were traveling.  Fifteen years later, journalist Karen O'Connor, who as a young polio survivor first met the duo at the same telethon portrayed in the movie's opening sequence, accepts a job to [[Ghostwriter|ghostwrite]] Vince Collins' autobiographyâa deal from which Collins will earn $1 million, which he badly needs. Karen makes a promise to Mrs. O'Flaherty that she will find the truth of how her daughter Maureen died. The project is complicated by the fact that she keeps receiving anonymously sent chapters from a book that Lanny Morris himself has written.  Karen, who has idolized the comedians ever since first meeting them, encounters Morris, accompanied by his faithful valet Reuben and manager Irv, by chance in the first-class section of a flight, where she shares a dinner table with them. Wishing to keep her identity secret, during the meal she introduces herself as "Bonnie Trout," the name of the best friend with whom she has traded apartments. Morris and Karen hit it off and have sex in his hotel. He disappears the next morning, apparently without leaving her a note.  Under her own name, Karen begins to work on the Collins autobiography. Complications arise when Collins invites her to an all-day working session at his [[Los Angeles]] home and she learns that Morris will be joining them as well. Near panic ensues; she abruptly invents an excuse to leave, but meets Morris in the driveway, and her masquerade is revealedâMorris discovers she has lied about who she is, and Collins discovers that the woman helping him write his memoirs is having or has had an affair with his ex-partner.  Collins agrees to continue with the book, but creates a situation to blackmail Karen into staying away from the story of Maureen O'Flaherty, which is Karen's consuming interest. After plying Karen with wine and drugs, Collins manipulates her into having sex with a young aspiring singer named Alice. He photographs the two women in compromising positions. Karen is told that unless she tells the publisher that there is nothing odd or improper surrounding Maureen's death, he will make the pictures public.  Karen discovers that Maureen had secretly recorded her interactions with Morris and Collins. Gradually, it becomes clear what really happened that night 15 years before: the three had engaged in a [[mÃ©nage Ã  trois]], fueled by drugs and booze, and at some point Collins tried to have sex with Morris, who resisted violently. Collins retreated to his room, whereupon Maureen tried to blackmail Morris into paying to keep this information a secret. (In 1957, it would have finished Collins professionally if it had come out that he was bisexual.) Morris tried to bribe Maureen to stay quiet but she wanted more money than he was either willing or able to give. Collins passed out in his room, Morris in his, and Maureen fell asleep on the couch. In the morning, she was dead.  Fifteen years later, Karen has begun to uncover the story. She discovers more about Morris' "fix-it man," Reuben. While both Morris and Collins were convinced the other murdered Maureen, they smuggled her body in a crate full of lobsters (a gift from Sanmarco) with Reuben's assistance, shipping it ahead of them to the New Jersey hotel. The tape recorder was on during the entire night, but the tape has been missing all these years.  Reuben offers to produce the tape. He asks Karen if her publishing company will pay him, say, $1 million for the tape. Karen puts two and two together and realizes that Reuben was blackmailing Collins, demanding $1 million to keep quiet about his bisexuality, proven on the tape, and perhaps his having murdered Maureen. (Collins was so drunk and drugged during that episode that he plainly does not remember what happened.) Reuben was demanding a million dollars for a murder he himself committed.  In the end, Collins is indeed destroyed, committing suicide. Morris is furious at Karen for all that she has set in motion, and Karen has the answer to her mystery. She goes to Mrs. O'Flaherty, saying she will publish the truth but only after an innocent bystander has diedâreferring to Maureen's mother herself, who would be crushed to learn of her daughter's behavior that contributed to her own death.  
The White Countess
  Having escaped the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Bolshevik Revolution]] in Russia, [[Countess]] Sofia Belinskaya is working as a [[taxi dancer]] in a seedy Shanghai bar to support her family of [[White Ã©migrÃ©]]s, including her daughter Katya, her mother-in-law Olga, her sister-in-law Grushenka, and an aunt and uncle by marriage, Princess Vera and Prince Peter. Despite the fact employment is scarce and her meagre income is the family's only source of revenue, Sofia's once-aristocratic relatives scorn her for her choice of profession and insist she keep it a secret from her child.  Sofia eventually meets Todd Jackson, a former official of the [[US State Department]] who recently lost his wife and daughter in separate terrorist bombings. The bombing that killed his child also left him blind. Using his substantial winnings from a well-placed bet at the racetrack, he opens an elegant nightclub catering to the cosmopolitan upper class and invites Sofia to work for him as his primary hostess, an offer she accepts, and in honour of her he calls the club ''The White Countess''. As time passes, the two begin to fall in love, but neither acts on their feelings until the political climate around them slowly disintegrates during the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and a mass exodus from the besieged city.  
When Romance Meets Destiny

Gwang-sik has a younger brother, Gwang-tae. Gwang-tae experiences none of the problems that plague his brother. For him, picking up women is almost an unconscious habit. Getting them into bed is a piece of cake. Disposing of them afterwards is no less simple, excepting the times when they track him down and throw rocks through his window. One day, however, he meets a woman named Kyung-jae who is just a little too smart, too attractive, and too mature for him to handle. Suddenly, he feels just as confused about relationships as his brother Gwang-sik.

White Noise (film)
 Jonathan Rivers ([[Michael Keaton]]) is a successful [[architect]] and lives a peaceful life with his wife Anna ([[Chandra West]]) until her unexpected disappearance. Eventually, he is contacted by Raymond Price ([[Ian McNeice]]), who claims that his own son had also died. He says he has recorded messages from Anna through [[electronic voice phenomena]] (EVP). While Jonathan is initially dismissive and angered, he later learns about his wife's tragic drowning. Desperate, he begins to believe that the recorded voice is indeed that of his wife, and becomes obsessed with trying to contact her himself. He is warned by a [[psychic]], Mirabelle Keegan ([[Keegan Connor Tracy]]), that she takes measures to avoid hostile entities, but EVP is an indiscriminate process that offers no such safeguards. A woman named Sarah Tate ([[Deborah Kara Unger]]), who also came to Raymond for his EVP work because she lost her [[fiancÃ©]], befriends Jonathan.  Raymond is found dead. Jonathan begins to be followed by three demons attracted by his obsession with EVP, and finds that some of the messages he is coming across are from people who are not yet dead, but may soon be. Jonathan hears cries from a woman whom he finds in a car with a child. He is able to save the child, but not the woman. At that woman's funeral, which Jonathan and Sarah both attend, Jonathan approaches the husband and tells him about what happened. The latter thanks Jonathan for saving his son but then asks to be left alone. The husband continues to tell Jonathan to stay away from him and his family. Afterwards, Jonathan sees images of another person, a missing woman named Mary Freeman, while working with his EVP devices. Sarah is later seriously injured by a fall from a balcony while possessed by the demons, that incident which was foreshadowed by Sarah's image being among those on the EVP devices.  Jonathan locates the site of his wife's death by following signs on recordings and he also finds his wife's abandoned car. Jonathan finds a set of computers and electronic equipment on site. A construction worker ([[Mitchell Kosterman]]) from his company, who has been doing his own EVP work, is holding Mary captive. He has been under the control of the demons to kill all these people, including Anna. The three demons torture Jonathan by breaking his arms and legs and cause him to fall to his death, but a SWAT team along with Detective Smits ([[Mike Dopud]]) arrives and are able to save Mary by shooting the construction worker dead. After his funeral, Jonathan's voice can be heard on the radio through static interference saying "I'm sorry" to his son. The child recognizes the voice and smiles. Sarah, at the graveside in a wheelchair, is menaced by odd noises. And right before the credits roll in, the camera flashes to a TV where Jonathan and his wife are visible.  
The White Masai
 Carola (Hoss), a German woman living in Switzerland, is on holiday with her boyfriend in [[Kenya]].<ref></ref> She falls in love with [[Maasai people|Maasai]] warrior Lemalian (Ido), who is visiting dressed in the clothing of his area. At the airport on the way home she decides to stay. It turns out that Lemalian has gone to his home village in the [[Samburu District]]. Carola travels to the area, and stays at the house of another European woman. Lemalian hears about her stay and comes to meet her.  Eventually they start living together.  She travels to Switzerland to sell her shop there, promising Lemalian to come back to him. She does, and they marry and have a daughter. Carola buys a car and starts a shop. They lose money on the shop because Lemalian gives too much credit to friends and neighbors, and because they have to pay bribes to the mini-chief. Lemalian argues that this is no problem because she has more money in Switzerland.  The mini-chief demands that Carola hires his teenage nephew as a shop assistant. She has to accept this although she does not need him and he does not work hard. After some time, when he is just drinking beer and not working, she fires him. Later he returns and attacks her. A local judge rules that she has to pay two goats for firing him, but the boy's family has to pay her five goats to compensate for the attack.  Carola is frustrated by the [[female circumcision]] being practiced in the village. She wants to stop it, but it is a long tradition that is not easily changed.  When Carola helps a pregnant woman in labour with a [[breech birth]], Lemalian refuses to assist because the woman is supposedly bewitched.  Lemalian does not want Carola to be friendly with other men, even if she is just serving a customer in a friendly way. He is very jealous and suspicious of Carola having a boyfriend. He even wants to kill a man he suspects.  Carola wants to return to Switzerland with her daughter, stating she needs a two-week holiday. After some hesitation, Lemalian signs a form giving Carola consent to take the girl out of Kenya, although he suspects that she will not return.  
The Wig
 A young woman named Soo-hyeon ([[Chae Min-seo]]) is struggling against cancer and her older sister Ji-hyeon ([[Yoo Sun]]) decides that she should take her home so that she really can enjoy what little time she has left rather than to spend it in a hospital. Ji-hyeon is a mute, during a car accident which impaled her throat. She now cannot speak again and can only make rasping noises at the most; despite this, she is a very strong person and very caring for her little sister. She buys a long-haired [[wig]] with bangs for her so that she can go out without having to feel ashamed of herself; what she doesn't know is that the wig is cursed. Soo-hyeon is so happy with the wig on, she begins to look and act a lot healthier and far more attractive. She leaves the house often, to take photos of herself at various locations.  Soon, however, she begins to flirt and try and steal Ji-hyeon's boyfriend. He breaks up with Ji-hyeon but is still not too interested in Soo-hyeon. One day, one of Ji-hyeon's friends finds out that her husband is cheating on her and is at a loss for a solution to her problem. Soo-hyeon lends her wig saying that she will feel that she looks prettier and better. She agrees and takes the wig home. The next day she is found dead with her husband, covered in hair. Soo-hyeon's wig returns to her, mysteriously. She then goes out to a club with Ji-hyeon's ex-boyfriend. Ji-hyeon follows her and attempts to speak to her in the toilets, but Soo-hyeon cruelly ignores her and she leaves. Soo-hyeon tries to put her makeup on but is then suddenly plagued with frightening images of her sister's friend's demise. Ji-hyeon takes her home. The next day, Soo-hyeon tries to have sex with Ji-hyeon's ex, but Ji-hyeon picks her up and the two drive home in silence, until Soo-hyeon begins to [[goad]] her. Ji-hyeon angrily stomps on the brakes, but soon begins to drive on.  At home the two don't speak until Soo-hyeon washes the wig, when Ji-hyeon sees a [[ghost]] in the wig. Soo-hyeon begins to brush her "hair" later on, but Ji-hyeon grabs the wig from her head and locks Soo-hyeon in her room. As Soo-hyeon pounds on the door screaming, her sister cuts the wig to shreds. The cancer then comes back to Soo-hyeon and she has to go back to hospital, unhappy and heartbroken, refusing to see her sister. Things turn from bad to worse as Soo-hyeon escapes from the hospital after not taking her medication. We see a twisted, disturbing scene of Soo-hyeon pulling pills from her bloody scalp.  We are then shown that the wig belonged to a man who was in a romantic relationship with Ji-hyeon's ex-boyfriend. Being gay, he was eventually shunned by Ji-hyeon's ex and beaten by a group of teens, cutting his long hair out. He then committed suicide by jumping off a building. The ghost of the man (now fully possessing Soo-hyeon) is using her as a host and tries to go back with Ji-hyeon's ex. As they kiss, Soo-hyeon's hair grows very long at an impossibly fast rate. Ji-hyeon appears and fights the ghost in her sister's body and sets fire to the long hair, freeing her sister and destroying the ghost. Unfortunately, Ji-hyeon hallucinates that the ghost is there instead of her sister and beats her to death with her camera. As Soo-hyeon dies, her sister cries at what she had done. The film ends, showing the two girls as children in a photograph, before Soo-hyeon's cancer and Ji-hyeon's speech loss.  
The Wild Blue Yonder
 The film is about an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] (played by [[Brad Dourif]]) who came to Earth several decades ago from a [[Ocean planet|water planet]] (The Wild Blue Yonder), after it experienced an [[ice age]]. His narration reveals that his race has tried through the years to form a community on our planet, without any success.  The alien also tells the story of a space mission he found out about through his job with the [[CIA]]. In the late 1990s debris from the [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell UFO crash]] was unearthed and examined. Scientists incorrectly believed that they had contracted an infectious alien disease from the debris. An exploratory mission was launched to Blue Yonder (represented with archival footage from [[STS-34]] and [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]]'s diving expedition in [[Antarctica]]) to explore the possibility that a new, uninfected human colony might be established there. After deciding Blue Yonder was suitable for human habitation, the [[astronauts]] returned to Earth 820 years later, only to discover that the planet had been abandoned in their absence.  
Wild Things: Diamonds in the Rough
 Marie Clifton is set to inherit two beautiful diamonds, called the "mother and daughter", which her late mother bestowed to her. Marie's step-father, Jay Clifton, challenges the will, claiming that Marie isn't ready for the responsibility, but actually wants to take the diamonds for himself. At a sexual education seminar at Marie's school, physician Dr. Chad Johnson and probation officer Kristen Richards discuss sex crimes, and Richards reveals she was a victim of an anonymous rapist many years before.  At Marie's swim-meet, Jay encounters towel girl Elena Sandoval, and invites her to Marie's eighteenth birthday party. Elena attends the party but is assaulted by Marie, who says that Elena is not welcome. Jay comforts Elena, and brings her to the construction site of one of his buildings for privacy. Later, Elena alleges that Jay raped her at the site. Detective Michael Morrison is placed on the case, as is Richards, who is Elena's probation officer. Chad is placed in charge of documenting Elena's injuries, and testifies to the court that Elena was raped.   Marie believes that Elena is doing this for money and tells Jay to pay her off. When Jay admits that he's broke, Marie suggests that they sell the diamonds. Jay agrees, and revokes his claim to the will, giving Marie custody of the diamonds so she can sell them off. However, this was a ploy between Elena, Marie and Chad to get the diamonds, and the trio are in a sexual relationship together.  Jay believes that Elena will recant her accusation after being paid off, but at the next court session Elena testifies that Jay also threatened to kill her. Jay is sent to prison, but Richards is now suspicious of Elena's behavior. Richards and Morrison search Elena's trailer and discover she's gathered information about Kristen's rape, using it to form her testimony. Richards and Morrison discuss their suspicions with Jay, and conclude that Marie, Elena and Chad must be working together.  Chad is questioned by Richards and Morrison, and fears they suspect him. He turns on Marie, drugging her and stealing the diamonds. Marie and Elena give chase, following Chad into the woods, where Marie kills him with a tire iron. Marie then meets the diamond buyer Chad set up, but learns that the diamonds are fake. Elena, who is left to deal with Chad's body, is caught by Richards and Morrison.  Richards and Morrison give Elena a task: wear a wire and get Marie to admit she killed Chad, and the charges against Elena will be lessened. Elena goes to Marie and plays along with her plan to get the real diamonds from Chad's safe at the construction site. Throughout, Elena repeatedly tries to get Marie to confess, but is unsuccessful. When Marie and Elena finally get the diamonds from the safe, Elena pulls a gun on her and flees with the diamonds, prompting Marie to chase her with her own gun. Richards and Morrison, who are listening in from nearby, enter the construction site separately. During the hide-and-seek, Richards finds Marie and shoots her in the chest, killing her. Afterward, Elena claims there were no diamonds, and is escorted from the scene by Richards.  At the end it's revealed that Richards and Elena are mother and daughter. Jay was the man that raped Kristen in the past, and Elena is their daughter. During the credits, scenes are shown explaining how they managed to pull their plan off.

Winter Passing
 Reese Holdin (Deschanel) is a [[clinical depression|depressed]] bartender/actress living in [[New York City]]. She regularly engages in casual sex, [[cocaine]] use and [[self-harm]]. When a publishing agent ([[Amy Madigan]]) approaches her, we learn that Reese is the daughter of a famous author named Don Holdin (Harris); and that her mother, Mary, recently died. Reese did not attend the funeral. The publisher offers the impecunious Reese $100,000 for a series of letters written between her mother and father at the height of their careers. When Reese learns that the kitten she rescued from the streets is dying of [[Feline leukemia virus|feline leukemia]], she drowns it and buys a bus ticket.  Despite such family tensions, Reese travels to [[Michigan]]'s [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] to retrieve the letters.  Returning to her childhood home, she finds it occupied by Corbit (Ferrell), a down-and-out [[Christian]] musician, and Shelley (Warner), a 23-year-old former student of Don's. Reese's father now lives, writes and drinks in his garage.  Reese initially clashes with the doting Shelley (whom she accuses of sleeping with her father) but eventually accepts her after learning of the death of her parents and of Don's support of her during a near-fatal bout with [[endometriosis]].  She also bonds with the idiosyncratic Corbit, who spurns her sexual advances and has trouble playing guitar and singing at the same time. She feels out of place at home and fights with her father over childhood neglect, stating that her parents gave their typewriters more attention. She eventually finds the box of letters and, reading the emotional communiques, learns to empathize with her estranged parents.  Shelly has also read the letters and asks Reese if she intends to publish them. Reese expresses ambiguity over the matter.  Don Holdin is still grieving over his wife's death. He keeps the tie she hanged herself with in a dresser in the backyard along with the rest of their bedroom suite, including their bed. He sometimes sleeps in the bed despite the bitter cold of winter. Reese starts to connect with Corbit and Shelly and is honest with her father about her reasons for staying away from the funeral. Soon after, Don overdoses on pills, and Reese finds him unconscious. He recovers in the hospital, where Reese sits by his bed and reads his latest manuscript, ''Golf'', which he had Corbit bury in the yard. The experience helps the father and daughter find closure, and Reese buries the box of letters in place of the novel before returning to New York.

Wolf Creek (film)
 In [[Broome, Western Australia]], 1999, two British tourists, Liz Hunter and Kristy Earl, are [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking]] across the country with Ben Mitchell, an Australian friend from [[Sydney]]. Ben buys a dilapidated [[Ford XD Falcon]] for their road journey from [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]] to [[Cairns]], [[Queensland]] via the [[Great Northern Highway]]. The night before leaving, they get drunk at a wild pool party and camp out on the beach.  After stopping at [[Halls Creek, Western Australia|Halls Creek]] for the night, the trio make another stop at [[Wolfe Creek Crater|Wolf Creek National Park]], which contains a giant [[Impact crater|crater]] formed by a 50,000-ton [[meteorite]]. Hours later, upon returning to their car, the group discovers that their watches have all suddenly stopped and that the car will not start. Unable to solve the problem, they prepare to sit out the night. After dark, a rural man named Mick Taylor comes across them and offers to tow them to his camp to repair the car. Initially hesitant, the group allows Mick to take them to his place, an abandoned mining site several hours south of Wolf Creek. Mick regales them with tall stories of his past while making a show of fixing their car. His manner unsettles Liz, although Ben and Kristy are less concerned. While they sit around a fire, Mick gives the tourists water which he describes as "rainwater from the top end". The water eventually causes the tourists to fall unconscious.  Liz awakens to find herself gagged and tied up in a shed. She manages to break free, but before she can escape from the mining site, she hears Mick torturing Kristy in a garage, and witnesses him sexually assaulting her. Liz sets the now-dismantled Falcon on fire to distract him, and goes to help Kristy while Mick is busy trying to extinguish the blaze. When he returns, Liz manages to shoot Mick with his own rifle, the bullet hitting him in the neck and apparently killing him. The women attempt to flee the camp in Mick's truck. But before they can do so, Mick stumbles out of the garage, revealing the gunshot was non-fatal and that he's still alive. He proceeds to shoot at them with a double-barreled shotgun before giving chase in another car. The women evade Mick by pushing his truck off a cliff and hiding behind a bush, before returning to the mining site to get another car. Liz leaves the hysterical Kristy outside the gates, telling her to escape on foot if she does not return in five minutes.  Liz enters another garage and discovers Mick's large stock of cars as well as an organised array of travellers' possessions, including video cameras. She watches the playback on one of them and is horrified to see Mick "helping" other travellers stranded at Wolf Creek in almost identical circumstances to her own. She then picks up another camera which turns out to be Ben's, and while viewing some of Ben's footage, notices Mick's truck in the background, indicating he'd been following them long before they got to Wolf Creek. She gets into a car and attempts to start it, but Mick appears in the back seat and stabs her through the driver's seat with a [[bowie knife]]. Liz crawls out of the car, and Mick hacks Liz's fingers off in one swipe, then headbutts her into near unconsciousness. He then severs her spinal cord with the knife, paralyzing her and rendering her a "head on a stick". He then proceeds to interrogate her as to Kristy's whereabouts.  By dawn, a [[barefoot]] Kristy has reached a highway and is discovered by a passing motorist. He attempts to help Kristy, but is shot dead from a distance by Mick, who has a sniper rifle. Mick gives chase in a [[Statesman (automobile)|Holden HQ Statesman]], prompting Kristy to take off in the dead man's car. She succeeds in running Mick off the road, but he gets out of the car and shoots out Kristy's back tire, causing the car to roll. Kristy climbs out of the vehicle and attempts to crawl away, but is shot dead by Mick. He bundles Kristy's body into the back of his car, along with the body of the dead motorist, and torches the wrecked car before driving off.  Ben awakens to find himself nailed to a mock [[crucifix]] in a mine shaft, with two aggressive, caged [[Rottweilers]] in front of him. He manages to extract himself from the crucifix and enters the camp in early daylight. Ben escapes into the outback, but becomes dehydrated, and eventually passes out beside a dirt road. He is discovered by a Swedish couple who take him to [[Kalbarri, Western Australia|Kalbarri]], where he is airlifted to a hospital.  A series of title cards states that despite several major police searches, no trace of Liz or Kristy has ever been found. Early investigations into the case were disorganised, hampered by confusion over the location of the crimes, a lack of physical evidence and the alleged unreliability of the only witness. After four months in police custody, Ben was later cleared of all suspicion. He currently lives in South Australia.  The film ends with the silhouette of Mick walking into the sunset with his rifle in hand.

Adaa's brother Shakeel has joined hands with the terrorists to gain a free Kashmir. Circumstances soon lead to Aman and Adaa falling in love. Aman does not let the army know about his new relationship. He is given the task of finding and eliminating terrorists; he captures their leader, who happens to be Shakeel's mentor. Adaa's family learns about her affair with Aman. Her grandmother approves of the relationship, but her father requests Aman to stay away from them, as their love will not be approved in that place.  A disappointed Aman is then given another mission. Acting on a tip, he and his men go to raid a terrorist hideout but are attacked by the terrorists. Many insurgents are killed, and Aman and four comrades are taken captive by Shakeel. They demand the release of their leader from the government in exchange for the soldiers. But Adaa finds her brother's hideout, goes there, and pleads with him not to harm Aman. Using the opportunity, Aman breaks free and escapes with Adaa, just as the army besieges the place and rescues the captured army men.  Now Aman and Adaa's affair becomes known to the army. Suspicion falls on Aman that he is in cahoots with the terrorists, as he is not at their hideout, and he has run off with Adaa. As soon as he arrives in the city, he is arrested and court marshaled. Adaa does all she can to help Aman. She goes to the chief minister, who agrees to help her but on the condition that she deny any relationship with Aman in public, as it can affect the reputation of the army. Adaa does not agree to that. Instead, on the advice of her mute sister, writes a letter to the prime minister, telling him her story and seeking help for Aman. As fate would have it, she is called by a TV channel for a live interview and to tell her story to the world. This news spreads, and the terrorists are irked. They advise Shakeel to put an end to it all: He takes over a mosque, holding people hostage in exchange for their leader and Adaa's silence. They also bomb Adaa's house (at their leader's orders), injuring her grandmother gravely. Adaa decides to broadcast her story live, no matter what. Shakeel demands from the government that he negotiate with the man who had a relationship with his sister: Aman.  In the climax, Aman enters the mosque alone and faces Shakeel. Shakeel beats him black and blue, then sees that his father is one of the hostages in the mosque. At the same time, Adaa tells her story live on TV. Everyone listens to the heart-wrenching tale of the two lovers and a plea for Shakeel to return. Aman tells Shakeel that the terrorist leader had bombed Shakeel's house and his grandmother is in hospital. The terrorists then decide to leave, holding a man and a few hostages as guard. As soon as they step out, pre-planned by Aman who is wearing a bulletproof jacket, a sniper commando shoots him. He falls from the impact, thus giving the sniper a chance to aim at other terrorists. The army invades and forces the other terrorists to surrender. In the end, Adaa arrives and they leave the scene together.

However, Simar agrees to meet Kabir one last time. Nikhil follows Simar to a secluded house, where he witnesses an apparent argument between Simar and Kabir. After a chase through the woods, it is revealed that Simar staged the entire thing: Kabir was never on the phone nor in the house, because he has been dead the whole time. Simar confesses that on the night of the  accident, Nikhil had found Simar and Kabir together, and in his rage he killed Kabir. Simar wanted to protect Nikhil from the guilt, since she'd believed his amnesia had been a chance to start their relationship anew.

It shows the college life of students, their hostel life, the way they enjoy themselves in the college and the hard work they put in for their studies. Fellow students of Punjab University, Navdeep Singh ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) and Harman Kaur ([[Juhi Babbar]]), fall in love with each other. Both start to dream of a happy life together. But problems arise when they think of taking their parent's consent before going any further. Harman's father Col. Thakur Singh ([[Anupam Kher]]) is a typical Punjabi father with a big ego who does not appreciate the idea of his daughter selecting a groom herself.

The couple then conspire with their fellow students and arrange for their parents to meet on neutral ground. It is this decision that will shatter and change their lives forever. Now both Navdeep and Harmaan are in a dilemma: neither can they go against their parents, nor can they live without each other. How they convince their parents about their relationship without hurting their sentiments is the rest of the story.

Together, they resolve to fight these stinking monsters, who have dominated the entire punch stream. Xuxinha and Biel also resolve to investigate the case, not knowing that this involvement would bring definitive consequences to the life of the angel.  
Yamato (film)
 The film begins with footage from ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'''s special expedition to the ''Yamato'' wreckage in 1999, then to a woman, Makiko Uchida, visiting the [[Yamato Museum]] in [[Kure, Hiroshima]] on 6 April 2005. She is looking for a boat to take her to the site where the ''Yamato'' sank, to honor the crew on the 60th anniversary of the ship's last battle. Katsumi Kamio, a survivor who is now a fisherman, agrees to take her after he discovers she was an adopted daughter of [[Naval ranks of the Japanese Empire during World War II|Petty Officer First Class]] Mamoru Uchida, a fellow crewman and close friend who he thought went down with the ship.  As Uchida, Kamio, and his teenage apprentice, Atsushi, travel to the site on his fishing boat, the narrative shifts between the present and Kamio's memories of his service as an [[air defense]] crewman aboard the warship during the [[Second World War]].  In the spring of 1944, Kamio and other cadets, many of whom are only teenagers, are assigned to the ''Yamato'' and are subjected to harsh training and discipline at the hands of Petty Officers Uchida, Moriwaki, and Karaki, who have served on the vessel since it was launched in 1941. In October 1944, the ''Yamato'' sails as part of a large Japanese fleet to engage American forces at the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. During the battle, the ''Yamato'' sustains several hits, killing or injuring several crew. ''Yamato'' and the surviving ships return to Japan for repairs, while Uchida (who lost his left eye in the battle) is sent to a hospital to recover.  In March 1945, the crew hear rumors of a planned mission against the expected [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]] and are given a few days of [[shore leave]]. During this time, Kamio returns home and learns that his mother died protecting his girlfriend,<ref></ref> Taeko Nozaki, during an air raid on Kure. Taeko confesses her love for Kamio when he explains that he must go to Okinawa and gives him a special amulet for protection.  Uchida uses the shore leave to escape the hospital and rejoin the crew. Meanwhile, [[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]] representative Vice-Admiral [[RyÅ«nosuke Kusaka]] arrives and briefs the admiral-in-charge of ''Yamato'', Vice-Admiral [[Seiichi ItÅ]], and the other senior officers, of the details of ''[[Operation Ten-Go]]''. It will almost certainly be a suicide mission - and with no air cover, the entire Japanese force will be extremely vulnerable to Allied attacks, making it unlikely that they will even reach Okinawa. Fights break out among the crew as some believe the mission is futile, but an officer convinces them that the ''Yamato'', as Japan's last operational battleship, must make every effort to defend the nation.  On the morning of April 7, the ''Yamato'' and its escorts assume battle stations after [[Task Force 58]] detects it on the way to Okinawa and sends its strike planes to intercept. The crew opens fire with their anti-aircraft weapons as the planes appear. However, the sheer number of US aircraft overwhelm the defenses and the ''Yamato'' takes heavy damage from multiple bombs and torpedo hits. Kamio, Uchida, and Moriwaki continue to man a portside [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|AA battery]] after strafing runs and bomb strikes kill much of the crew, including Karaki. After being told the ship is crippled and sinking, Admiral ItÅ and Captain [[KÅsaku Aruga]] give the order to abandon ship, although both choose to stay behind. Uchida and Moriwaki throw Kamio overboard despite his wish to stay with them to the end. The radioman attempts to call for support but water starts flooding the ship, which eventually capsizes and explodes.  The ''Yamato'''s remaining escorts start rescuing the survivors, but Kamio fails to save his friend Tetsuya Nishi despite promising his mother that he would look after him. Moriwaki ties Kamio to be hoisted aboard a rescue vessel and swims away to drown himself.  The film flashes forward to the present day; the old Kamio has a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], but Makiko and Atsushi revive him. He also discusses what happened to him during the final months of the war. He recounts that after the sinking, he went and told Nishi's mother that her son had died "a hero's death." Kamio expresses his grief that, despite risking his life in battle, he was ultimately unable to protect anyone he loved - Taeko died of radiation poisoning after the [[Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], where she had been conscripted to work at a munitions plant. However, she was able to see him before she died and suggested ''Asukamaru'' as the name for his boat.  They arrive at the sinking coordinates the following day, where they hold a small ceremony. Makiko scatters Uchida's ashes and Kamio gives her a dagger that Uchida asked him to keep during the battle. The dagger was Uchida's most prized possession; Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] gave it to him when the ''Yamato'' was his flagship. The three head back to Japan after the ceremony.  The end credits show Makiko laying flowers at a memorial for those who died in the battle.

Meanwhile, Soy and Tong cuddle, kiss and hug each other at every opportunity.

In Joei's absence, Yam begins to long for her, discovering that he cares for her after all. Both Soy and Joei write letters to their men, but they hear nothing in return. It turns out that Dok Toh has bribed the postman to deliver letters addressed to Yam and Tong to her, and she in turn dumps the letters into the river.  Joei and Soy determine that their letters aren't getting through, so they write to the abbot at the local [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple and ask him to deliver their letters to Yam and Tong.  Yam and Tong, meanwhile, strike out on their own and head for Bangkok to try to find the girls. Neither had ever been to the city before, and did not realize how big the capital was.

The girls return to Yasothon for [[Thai New Year|Songkran]], and Soy is reunited with Tong. Yam is heartbroken when he does not see Joei on the bus. In fact she was on the bus, but because she had drastically changed her appearance, Yam did not recognize her, and showed no interest in Joei when she approached him.  The engagement of Soy and the sheriff's son is still on, though. Tong falls into despair, starts drinking and becomes a hopeless [[alcoholic]]. On the day of the engagement ceremony, Tong's father shows up with shotgun to disrupt the proceedings. He points out that Soy does not love the sheriff's son and he demands that Tong be allowed to marry Soy.  As for Yam, he comes around and sees that Joei is the same woman, even if she's changed on the outside.

Helen North, a widowed handbag designer with ten kids (four biological, six adopted) takes a more relaxed approach on life. After unexpectedly encountering each other at a restaurant while on separate dates, they do so again at their 30-year high school reunion.  Instantly rekindling their old sparks, Frank and Helen quickly decide to marry in a private ceremony, to the Beardsley and North kids' shock. They move into a new home on the same property where they shared their first kiss, joined by the North children's numerous pets (including a [[pot-bellied pig]] and a [[hamster]]), and Frank's housekeeper, Mrs. Munion.  It soon becomes apparent that Frank has a very regimented view of how things should be done, whereas Helen is an artist (a designer by trade) with a more free-spirited, lackadaisical attitude. Their respective children are shocked by the news of their parents' quick wedding and do not get along well at first, even turning a planned lighthouse renovation project into an all-out paint fight.  Frank's oldest son, William, calls a meeting among his siblings and explains that they can better rid themselves of their new situation by joining forces to make their parents' respective philosophical differences apparent, which will cause them to fight. But while doing so, they gradually begin to bond, attending their siblings' soccer games and helping William in his class president campaign.  A short time later, Frank and Helen attend a formal Coast Guard dinner where his superior, Commandant Sherman, officially offers him the opportunity to be his successor. He respectfully declines it, citing both his obligation to the Coast Guard Academy and his new family. Meanwhile, as the young children have a [[food fight]] upstairs in the bedroom, the older ones throw a wild party downstairs. When their parents return to find the place in total chaos, Frank is furious and Helen's more laid-back approach only angers him more. This causes their worst fight yet, and the children, realizing how happy their parents have been together, begin to realize that they might have pushed things too far.  The next day, Frank informs Helen that he has decided to take the position as Commandant after all, and they schedule a family meeting to inform the children. As the children return home from school, jubilant over having defended their younger siblings from bullies and with the news of William having won the class election, Frank quickly deflates the mood by telling them of his decision to accept the new position. Feeling guilty for having torn their parents apart, they set about undoing their mistakes, even enlisting Helen to aid in their efforts. Together, the older ones launch the family's boat in an effort to catch Frank (thereby fulfilling his previous dream of having an all-family sailing team that failed earlier), but he is convinced that Helen no longer wants to be with him, until he sees her turn on the lighthouse spotlight (a reference to a story Frank had told her about a beautiful female lighthouse keeper). Successfully reunited, they tie the knot once again, this time with the children involved.  
Zathura: A Space Adventure
   Walter and his younger brother Danny do not get along with each other or their older sister, Lisa. While their divorced father is away at work and Lisa, whom he left in charge, is napping, Danny discovers an old [[outer space|space]]-themed board game called "Zathura" in the basement. He convinces Walter to play the game with him, the goal of which is to become the first player to reach the final space on the board. Each turn, a player turns a key and presses a button, causing the board to move the player's piece a random number of spaces and spit out an event card. When Danny's first turn causes a [[meteor shower]] inside the living room, Walter and Danny realize playing the game has altered reality.  The boys discover their father's house is floating in space. Lisa, unaware of the situation, wakes up and begins preparing for her date that evening, but is frozen stiff when another card turns the bathroom into a [[Cryonics|cryonic]] chamber. Walter concludes the only way to end the game and return everything to normal is to win the game. As they continue to play, Walter and Danny must overcome the dangers presented by the game cards, including the appearance of a defective robot, passing too close to a Sun-like planet and an attack on the house by a race of reptilian [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] called Zorgons. Another of Danny's turns produces an astronaut, who methodically eliminates the house's heat sources and lures the Zorgons' ship away by ejecting the boys' father's couch after setting it on fire.  Walter asks the astronaut to leave, but Danny chooses to let him stay. Growing increasingly agitated, Walter accuses Danny of cheating by supposedly moving his piece prematurely; when Walter tries to move the piece back and takes his next turn, the game accuses Walter of cheating and ejects him from the house into the vacuum of space, but the astronaut retrieves him. On Walter's next turn, he receives a card that allows him to make a wish resulting in another falling out between the boys. The astronaut warns Walter not to make a wish out of anger. Fearing the worst, he is relieved to discover that Walter wished merely for an autographed football. He explains that he and his brother had played the game fifteen years before, and he wished his brother away, causing him to be stuck in the game without a second player.  Lisa awakens from her stasis, and still oblivious to the situation, turns up the heat. This causes the Zorgons to return and anchor their ships to the house. Lisa finally discovers their predicament, and the four hide upstairs, but realize they left the game behind. The astronaut uses the house's [[dumbwaiter]] to lower Danny to retrieve the game. Danny finds the game aboard one of the Zorgon ships, but is seen by the Zorgons. Walter uses a "Reprogram" card he drew earlier to fix the malfunctioning robot, who attacks the Zorgons instead, and the aliens retreat.   Walter receives another wish card; he uses it to bring back the astronaut's brother, causing a [[doppelgÃ¤nger]] of Danny to appear. The astronaut reveals he is actually Walter, and commends his younger self for making a better choice than he did 15 years ago of his timeline, and the astronaut and the alternate Danny merge with their counterparts as the future changes.  The Zorgons return to the house with a large fleet, intent on destroying it. Danny makes a final move, landing on Zathura, and wins, creating a [[black hole]] that sucks up the Zorgon fleet and the house. The siblings awaken in the house as it was before the brothers started the game, just as their father arrives home. Their bond renewed, they promise to each other to not tell anyone about the game and their adventure. After they leave with their mother, Danny's bicycle, which had been orbiting their house, falls from the sky.

Antoine says that, as he watched the coroner lay out the victim's internal organs, he thought of [[Mozart]]: "How can all that stuff compose music?"

Zerophilia
 "Zerophilia" is a fictional condition that affects an unknown number of people with an extra [[XY sex-determination system|"Z" chromosome]].  Following their first full sexual experience, zerophiliacs begin to change sex after experiencing an orgasm.  Luke ([[Taylor Handley]]), a young man somewhat insecure about his masculinity, begins to exhibit zerophilia following an encounter with a woman ([[Kelly Le Brock]]).  He meets Michelle (Rebecca Mozo) and experiences partial transformations when they go out together.  He confides with his best friend Keenan (Dustin Seavey) about his partial transformations, who in turn contacts Dr. Sydney Catchadourian ([[Gina Bellman]]). Dr. Catchadourian persuades Luke to go through a full transformation. Luke does this by masturbating, becoming female, and subsequently calling herself "Luca". Luca has difficulty achieving an orgasm to change back, even with coaching from Keenan's girlfriend Janine ([[Alison Folland]]).  However, a visit by Michelle's attractive brother, Max ([[Kyle Schmid]]), who flirts with "Luke's cousin", enables her to get sufficiently aroused to complete the transformation back to Luke.  Luke is threatened by his sex transformation, his arousal by an attractive male, and the questions of sexual identity it raises; he seeks help from Sydney.  She tells him that a zerophiliac can become "a-morphic" and stop changing sex only by having sex with another zerophiliac... such as herself.  He reluctantly agrees to do it, but discovers afterward that she was not telling him the full truth: an a-morphic zerophiliac can still change by having sex with another zerophiliac, and Dr. Catchadourian was using Luke to change herself one last time (into a man), leaving Luca as a woman in the process.  Comic tensions arise from Luke's efforts to keep Michelle at a distance, Max's defensiveness about his sister, Luca's half-hearted resistance to Max's affections, and Luke's confused aggression toward Max.  When Michelle discovers that Luke had sex with Dr. Catchadourian, she feels betrayed.  Hoping to find Michelle, Luca seeks out Max to profess deep affection for Michelle and remorse for betraying her.  Max is touched by the apology, and reveals that he is actually Michelle, also a zerophiliac.  They make love repeatedly, changing sex mostly in sync with each other, but occasionally finding themselves the same sex. It ends with the happy couple apparently resolved to their 'condition' and past any questions of their gender and sexual identity.
