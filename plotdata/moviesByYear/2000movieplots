The 6th Day
 At some point in the indeterminate near future, the cloning of animals and human organs has become routine.  Cloning entire humans, however, is prohibited by what are known as "[[Genesis creation narrative|Sixth Day]]" laws. Billionaire Michael Drucker, owner of cloning corporation Replacement Technologies, hires charter pilot Adam Gibson and partner Hank Morgan for a ski trip. Due to Drucker's prominence, the two must first undergo blood and eye tests to verify their aptitude. On the day of Drucker's arrival, Adam finds that his family dog Oliver has died, and Hank offers to fly Drucker instead to allow Adam time to have the pet cloned. After visiting a "RePet" shop, he remains unconvinced and purchases an animatronic doll, a SimPal, named Cindy instead.  Adam returns home and discovers that not only has Oliver already been cloned, but a purported clone of himself is with his family, along with another SimPal Cindy. Replacement Technologies security agents Marshall, Talia, Vincent and Wiley arrive with the intention on killing Adam. Adam kills Talia and Wiley in the ensuing chase and escapes, but both are later cloned. After the police betray Adam to the security agents he escapes and seeks refuge at Hank's apartment. A while later, Tripp (whom Adam recognizes from the ski trip) kills Hank and is mortally injured by Adam. Revealed as a religious anti-cloning extremist, Tripp informs Adam that Hank was a clone, since he killed the original one on the mountaintop earlier that day, to be able to kill Drucker, who was also a clone, and there is now a new Drucker clone. Tripp then commits suicide to avoid being captured by Marshall and the others. The agents arrive again and Adam is able to disable Marshall and kill Talia again, and steals her thumb.  Adam sneaks into Replacement Technologies with Talia's thumb and finds Dr. Griffin Weir, the scientist behind Drucker's illegal human-cloning technology. Weir confirms Tripp's story, adding that to resurrect Drucker, the incident had to be covered up and Adam was cloned because they mistakenly believed he had been killed. Weir explains that Drucker – who already died years before – could lose all of his assets if the revelation became public, since clones are devoid of all rights. Sympathetic with Adam's plight, Weir gives him a memory disk (syncording) of the Drucker clone but warns him that Drucker may go after the other Adam instead, putting Adam's family in danger. Weir also discovers that Drucker has been engineering cloned humans with fatal diseases as an insurance policy against betrayal. Upon finding out that his own wife was one such victim, Weir confronts Drucker and resigns. Drucker shoots him dead while promising to clone both him and his wife.  Drucker's agents abduct the Gibson family and Adam comes face to face with his clone. The two reluctantly team up and devise a plan to destroy Drucker's facility. While Adam wrecks the security system and gets himself captured, the clone sneaks in, plants a bomb and rescues his family. Drucker, however, tells Adam that he himself is the clone; the other Adam is the original one. Enraged, Adam fights off Drucker's agents and Drucker is mortally wounded while Talia, Wiley, Vincent and Marshall are killed for the final time. Drucker manages to clone himself before he dies but the malfunctioning equipment causes the new Drucker to be incomplete. As the cloned Adam fights his way to the rooftop, he is rescued via helicopter by the real one as Drucker falls to his death before the facility explodes.  Now having a more moderate view of cloning, the real Adam arranges for his clone to move to Argentina to start a satellite office of their charter business. The clone's existence is kept a secret, especially upon discovering that his DNA has no embedded illnesses, giving him a chance at a full life, since he was of no political value to Drucker. As a parting gift to the Gibson family, the clone gives them Hank's RePet cat, Sadie. The real Adam gives the clone a flying send-off.  
3 Strikes (film)
 Robert Douglas ([[Brian Hooks]]) is in prison for one of two felonies he has previously committed. While in prison, he watches to a local news report that states California has instituted the [[Three-strikes law|habitual offenders law]], commonly referred to as the "three-strikes" law, which will put offenders with three felonies in prison for a minimum of twenty-five years. On his last day in prison, Robert is ecstatic about being released, informing his girlfriend, Juanita ([[N'Bushe Wright]]), of such and contacting his friend, Tone ([[Faizon Love]]) to pick him up after he gets out.  On the way to pick up Robert, Tone stops to pick up a woman on the street and takes her home. Tone tells his friend, J.J. ([[De'Aundre Bonds]]), to pick Robert up in his place. Shortly after leaving prison, while on the way to check in with Robert's probation officer, the pair are pulled over by police; J.J. reveals that the car they are driving is stolen and, unwilling to surrender, he begins shooting at the cops. Knowing he will be convicted for his third and final felony offense, Robert flees on foot. As he is trying to escape himself, Jay-Jay is wounded from a shot to the buttocks and is taken into custody. Robert escapes pursuit by hiding at a backyard party and, soon after returning home, learns he has been identified and implicated in the shooting as a suspect. Detective Jenkins ([[David Alan Grier]]) leads the investigation.  While in the hospital, J.J. calls his friend, Blue ([[Barima McKnight]]), and berates Robert for leaving him during the shooting, telling Blue that he plans to peg Robert as the shooter when the police come to interview him. The call is recorded on voice mail at Blue's home. Jay-jay antagonizes the man guarding his room, who then lets a homosexual janitor that was ogling J.J. from afar into the room. Unable to defend himself, it is assumed J.J. is sexually assaulted by the janitor.  At home, Robert receives a call from Tone. Parked outside Robert's house, Tone blames him for leaving J.J. by himself during the shootout, and tells him he plans to pass the word around the neighborhood for everyone to be on the lookout for him, insinuating there would be repercussions. Robert reaches out to his probation officer for help in proving his innocence, but is told that his best option is to simply turn himself in.  Robert gets into a heated argument with his father ([[George Wallace]]) and is kicked out of the house, but runs into his friend, Mike ([[E-40]]), who lends Robert enough money for him and Juanita to get a hotel room. Detective Jenkins and Officer Roberts ([[Dean Norris]]) stop by Robert's parent's house, but are turned away without a warrant to search the premises.  The following morning, Robert is informed by his mother that the police are searching for him, but more importantly that a woman named Dahlia ([[Mo'Nique]]) has  information that is critical to proving his innocence and keeping himself out of jail: the tape recording of J.J.'s call to Blue. She tells Robert to meet him at her house. Robert meets up with Mike once more, and asks Mike to set him up with a good lawyer.  At her home, Dahlia agrees to hand over the tape, but reveals she's had a crush on Robert since high school, and blackmails him into letting her have her way with him for the tape. Begrudgingly, Robert accepts her proposal. Having witnessed Robert enter Dahlia's house, Blue - Dahlia's brother - calls Tone, who brings several of his goons over to his location. As Robert sneaks out with the tape, Tone and his people are there to meet him, and begin to jump him. Just as quickly as it begins, the police show up and send a dog after Robert.  Robert manages to get to his car, and a high-speed chase ensues. After being cornered in an alley by Detective Jenkins and several other pursuing units, Robert attempts to give himself up, but Jenkins begins shooting anyway; in the confusion, Robert manages to get away again, and is picked up by Mike. Chased by police cars and surveilled by helicopters, Robert's chase is broadcast across every news network; he tells Mike to head to a church where he has told the lawyer Mike set him up with, Mr. Libowitz ([[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]]), he will hand himself over to the authorities. The media and dozens of spectators are there as he arrives. Robert manages to be taken into custody without any harm done to him.  At his trial, the judge believes the tape recording clearly proves Robert was not the shooter and was completely unaware that the vehicle he and J.J. were in at the time was stolen. The felony charges against him are dismissed, and he avoids being convicted of a crime that would have put him behind bars under the "three-strikes" law. However, the opposition points out that Robert did not check in with his probation officer after leaving prison, and Robert is sentenced to 30 days in jail for violating his parole.  Before court is adjourned, Robert's father tells him that he will personally pick him up after he is released. The epilogue states that Rob was eventually released from prison early due to overcrowding.  
100 Girls
 After leaving a party at a women's dormitory (aka the "virgin vault"), Matthew ([[Jonathan Tucker]]) is trapped in an elevator with an unknown, and unseen, woman when the power goes out. Matthew and this unknown woman have sex in the dark. When Matthew wakes up in the morning—still in the elevator—he finds himself alone with a pair of her [[panties]].<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0214388/synopsis</ref>  On a mission to find his mystery maiden by finding a matching bra for the panties, Matthew becomes the maintenance man of the virgin vault. After releasing mice, he goes room to room, setting traps. He convinces the panicked women to leave their rooms and then starts to look for a match. When he is unsuccessful, he continues to break things (such as the [[air conditioning]]) in an effort to find his woman. He also fixes the television set, which is greatly received by women he refers to as "[[Janeite|Jane-ites]]", as they have a great interest in films adapted from books by [[Jane Austen]]. He doesn't get much help from his roommate Rod (James DeBello), who keeps telling him to give up, and together they philosophize about men and women. Rod tells him that he doesn't need a girlfriend and that it's futile to try to find the "bra matching the panties", and Matthew accuses him of being too [[machismo|macho]]. Rod introduces Matthew to the "penile power", which involves the use of weights attached to his penis as a means of increasing the organ's size. He does this and insults women to make himself feel better about the problem he has with his manhood; he suffers from [[hypospadias]].  Early on, Matthew watches as a woman named Patty ([[Emmanuelle Chriqui]]) and her boyfriend Crick ([[Johnny Green actor|Johnny Green]]) fight. Crick is the [[epitome]] of the macho man [[stereotype]], with his big pectorals, conceited attitude, and abusiveness. He wears a [[ponytail]], a manicured [[goatee]], "male make-up", and chews [[nicotine gum]], much to Matthew's dismay. Matthew tries to save Patty, but is hurt by Crick. Crick leaves, and Patty tries to help Matthew, but Matthew can't help but think of Patty's reputation as a "[[slut]]."  While searching one room, Matthew finds himself trapped in the bathroom when the occupant returns. Matthew is attacked by Wendy ([[Larisa Oleynik]]), until she recognizes him as a high school classmate. Wendy decides to help Matthew in his quest to find his mystery maiden, hoping that, in the process, she may find one of her own, as she is a closeted [[lesbian]].  Matthew is nervous about talking to girls. Arlene ([[Katherine Heigl]]) and his teacher Ms. Stern ([[Aimee Graham]]) disparage Matthew, asserting that women are more dominant than men are. Arlene beats him at foosball.  Ms. Stern asserts that women, rather than men, should be in command. Rod tells Matthew that he's a chicken and should just give up on girls, while Matthew tells him that he has never been able to speak to girls, especially Cynthia ([[Jaime Pressly]]).  Matthew puts an advertisement in the school newspaper asking the girl he's seeking to meet him in the basement on a Thursday night. He sits in the dark every Thursday night, waiting for her to show up. The door opens one night, and he thinks it's her, but it's Wendy, coming to check up on him. Finally, the mystery maiden does show up, only to tell him to stop looking for her.  Despite the approach of the end of the semester, Matthew isn't deterred. He disguises himself in drag, as Francesca, as a means to continue his search. In drag, he is actually able to talk to Cynthia one on one which, (until she is injured later on after two students, who are moving furniture, accidentally drop a couch down the stairs crushing her), he is not able to do because he is intimidated by her good looks. Rod flirts with Francesca and later brags to Matthew that he had sex with Francesca. This makes Matthew so angry that he adds another weight onto Rod's "penile power" device, hurting him. Crick makes a pass at Matthew in drag while he fights with Patty. Matthew bites off part of Crick's tongue. As a result, Crick is unable to speak without [[lisping]].  Desperation sets in, so Matthew appeals to his mystery maiden by proclaiming his love for her to the whole dormitory. He finally determines his mystery maiden is Patty. She initially rejects him because she thought that he would see her only as a slut. Crick sees that Matthew wants Patty, but Matthew has him arrested for sexually assaulting him (when he was dressed as Francesca).  Matthew introduces Rod and Dora, and Arlene and Wendy hook up. Cynthia shows off her newly found martial art abilities that she discovered as a way to cope with frustration following her injury, and Ms. Stern learns a valuable lesson on gender equality, as Matthew stands up to her in front of the class, to an ovation. Finally, Matthew proclaims his passionate love to Patty, who sees his loving eyes, and they kiss.  
102 Dalmatians
 After three years in prison, [[Cruella de Vil]] has been cured of her desire for fur coats by Dr. Pavlov and is released into the custody of the probation office on the provision that she will be forced to pay the remainder of her fortune (eight million pounds) to all the dog shelters in the borough of [[Westminster]] should she repeat her crime. Cruella therefore mends her working relationship with her valet Alonzo and has him lock away all her fur coats. Cruella's probation officer, Chloe Simon, nevertheless suspects her, partly because Chloe is the owner of the now-adult Dipstick (one of the original 15 puppies from the previous film) who moved from Roger and Anita's house to her house.  Dipstick's mate, Dottie, has recently given birth to three puppies: Domino, Little Dipper and Oppull (who lacks spots). To mend her reputation, Cruella buys the Second Chance Dog shelter, owned by Kevin Shepherd, to resolve its financial insolvency that is on the verge of eviction. Meanwhile, Dr. Pavlov discovers that when his therapy's subjects are subjected to loud noises, they revert to their original states but conceals this discovery. When [[Big Ben]] rings in her presence, Cruella reverts to her former personality and enlists the help of French furrier Jean-Pierre LePelt to steal 102 Dalmatian puppies for a new fur coat with a hood.  When Kevin tells Chloe that if Cruella violates her parole, her entire fortune will go to him, since his dog shelter is the only one in the borough of Westminster, Cruella has Kevin framed for the theft of the puppies and invites Chloe and Dipstick to dinner while LePelt steals Dottie and her three puppies. Dipstick hurries back to the apartment and hides in LePelt's truck but is later captured at the train station. Chloe rushes home to save her pets but arrives too late. She is joined by Kevin, who has escaped from prison with help from his dogs and talking parrot, Waddlesworth.  Upon finding a ticket for the [[Orient Express]] to [[Paris]] dropped by LePelt, Kevin and Chloe attempt and fail to stop Cruella and LePelt, but Oppull and Waddlesworth pursue their enemies secretly. In Paris, Kevin and Chloe save some of the captive puppies, but they are seen and locked in the cellar just as the puppies flee. Cruella goes after the puppies alone. Alonzo, when scolded beyond his patience and had enough of being abused, defeats LePelt and frees Kevin and Chloe and they give chase to a bakery, where the puppies and Kevin's dogs imprison Cruella in an immense cake. She and LePelt are thereupon arrested.  Kevin and Chloe are personally awarded the remnants of Cruella's fortune by Alonzo himself and Oppull's coat finally develops spots.  
28 Days (film)
 Gwen Cummings ([[Sandra Bullock]]) spends her nights in a drunken haze with her boyfriend, Jasper ([[Dominic West]]). She ruins her sister ([[Elizabeth Perkins]]) Lily's wedding by showing up late and disheveled, delivering a drunken, rambling speech, and knocking over the wedding cake. Intoxicated, Gwen steals a limousine from the reception, tries to locate a cake store, and winds up losing control of the car and crashing into a house. She is given a choice between 28 days in jail or in a rehab center, and she chooses [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]].  Gwen is introduced to a variety of patients while in treatment: Oliver ([[Mike O'Malley]]) (a [[hypersexual]] [[cocaine]] addict), Daniel ([[Reni Santoni]])  and Roshanda ([[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]]) ([[alcoholic]]s), Bobbi Jean ([[Diane Ladd]]) (an older [[addict]]), Gerhardt ([[Alan Tudyk]]) (a gay man whose [[addiction]] is not specified), and Cornell ([[Steve Buscemi]]), the rehab facility's director (a recovered drug addict and alcoholic). Her roommate is young Andrea ([[Azura Skye]]), a [[heroin]] addict who sporadically [[self-harm]]s and is a fan of the fictitious [[soap opera]] ''Santa Cruz''.  Initially, Gwen is angry and resistant to taking part in any of the treatment programs on offer, refusing to admit that she is an alcoholic. On visiting day, Jasper shows up and slips her a bottle of medication, then the two sneak off for a day of drinking and drugging. Later, Gwen returns to the facility, clearly [[inebriated]]. The next day, Gwen is confronted by Cornell. He informs her that she's being kicked out of rehab the next day and will be going to jail instead. Gwen angrily denies that she has a problem with alcohol, that she can stop anytime that she wants. Ignored, she angrily makes her way back to her room, where she rifles through her tissue box to get to her smuggled drugs. She puts a pill in her mouth but quickly spits it back out, then tosses the open bottle out the third-story window.  All throughout the day, Gwen experiences [[Cold turkey|withdrawal symptoms]]. She shuns the meetings and any activities, all the while desperately trying to push through her physical discomfort on her own. Later that evening, in a moment of weakness, she attempts to climb out her window and retrieve the discarded meds. She falls, severely spraining her ankle, and is rescued by Eddie ([[Viggo Mortensen]]), a pro baseball player and fellow addict, who is just arriving as a new patient.  The next morning, Gwen asks Cornell for another chance, finally convinced that anyone who would climb out of a three-story window to chase a high might have a problem. He relents; and Gwen finally begins to participate in the recovery process, growing closer to her fellow addicts and her roommate, Andrea. Gwen discovers that Eddie is also a fan of ''Santa Cruz'', and their fellow group participants join Eddie and Andrea in catching up on tapes of the show. During therapy sessions, Gwen experiences [[flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s of a childhood that included a thrill-seeking addict mother who died of an overdose when Gwen was about six, leaving young Lily and Gwen to be raised by an aunt.  On one of his visits, Jasper proposes to Gwen, bringing champagne to celebrate. Not wanting to jeopardize her newfound sobriety, Gwen throws the champagne into the lake. Later, her fellow addicts try to encourage her to see that Jasper isn't taking her sobriety seriously and to be careful. At some point, Gwen's sister Lily attends a [[group therapy]] session but leaves in disgust when Gwen become dismissive of Lily's recollections and resentments of her younger sister's drunken antics.  Eddie and Gwen's friendship grows closer. Afraid to share what she'd done as a practicing alcoholic for fear of looking bad to Eddie, they share a moment when Eddie tells her that's just what she's done. She is just fine as she is. They are come upon by Jasper, who showed up unannounced. Jasper then proceeds to insult and pick a fight with Eddie, shoving him. Eddie punches him before Gwen stops any further violence. Eddie walks off, and Gwen and Eddie's friendship becomes estranged.  Gwen's roommate, Andrea, is soon to be released and has been agitated and moody at the prospect, as well as heartbroken that her mother has never visited her during her entire stint in rehab. Gwen discovers Andrea dead in their bathroom, clearly having overdosed. Andrea's death leaves Gwen devastated and perhaps wiser as to how an addict's behavior affects others. Gwen commits herself to restoring her relationship with her sister. Gwen and Lily reconcile, and Gwen leaves treatment, but not before Eddie warns her that Jasper is dangerous to her [[sobriety]].  Back in New York, Jasper tries to make amends to Gwen for his behavior. Reconciling, Gwen tries to help Jasper to understand what needs to change in their relationship to support her recovery; but she soon sees that Jasper doesn't take her sobriety seriously. Seeing old party friends, Jasper wants to join them, demonstrating that he won't change his lifestyle or adjust to her needs and [[abstention]]s as a recovering addict. Gwen comes to terms with the fact that they are too different now and starts to see that recovery, though an everyday struggle, might be attainable. She breaks up with Jasper and walks away for good. Some time later, she is reunited with a sober Gerhardt at a floral shop. In a post-credit scene, Eddie recognizes a ''Santa Cruz'' character, Falcon, arrive as a new patient at the rehab facility.  
101 Reykjavík
 Geek Hlynur is approaching 30 years old, still lives with his mother who is divorced from his alcoholic father, downloads porn and wanders around Reykjavík half-heartedly searching for a job while spending lots of time in Kaffibarinn, the central Reykjavík bar (the bar is owned in real life by writer/director Baltasar Kormákur and his soundtrack composer Damon Albarn, a long-standing Icelandophile). The cramped, dark and oddly furnished house in which Hlynur and his mother live features a bath which transfigures into a sofa as Hlynur steps naked out of it, in the middle of the lounge with his mother watching.   Hlynur's isolated world — no small metaphor for his home country — is going along rather blissfully ignorant of the greater joys involved with engaging in life until his mother's friend Lola Milagros arrives to stay at the house for a while. Lola is a Spanish [[flamenco]] instructor with a seductive smile, a sultry voice and a ''[[carpe diem|carpe-diem]]'' attitude. Unknown to Hlynur, she is also [[bisexual]] and in a physical relationship with his mother, Berglind. An enigmatic character, Lola quickly becomes the center of the household dynamic when, after a night of heavy drinking while Berglind is away, she and Hlynur sleep together. The fling remains a secret between Hlynur and Lola. (Throughout the film, the song ''[[Lola (song)|Lola]]'' often plays as background music.) As Hlynur gradually learns of their [[lesbian]] relationship, he becomes jealous of it, realizing that he was simply a momentary fling for Lola, but he is also the dutiful son who wants to accept his mother's newfound lesbianism and be happy for her. He also has occasional seeming [[oedipal]] / [[incestuous]] dreams about his mother.  Lola wants Hlynur to get out of the house and find himself something to do because she recognizes from the start that that's what he needs most, but Hlynur prefers to pass the time in a true slacker fashion with plenty of excess and not an iota of effort. He sees no real future for himself, rather an entire life supported by the Icelandic welfare state. "It's a great system." he says. When asked what he does, Hlynur responds with, "Nothing." Pushed further with, "What kind of nothing?" he replies the only way he can: "A nothing kind of nothing." Not even death is a serious topic for Hlynur — intoxicating, out-all-night weekends inspire, "Each weekend I drop dead." He says this while lighting up a Lucky atop a snow-capped mountain, where he lies down as the snow gradually covers him up, but his plans are scuppered by rainfall melting his would-be tomb. His mixed up thoughts include musings about suicide: "The worst thing about AIDS as a method of suicide is that it takes so long to die from it."  On the other hand, Hlynur's fantasy life is alive with passion and glimpses of his subconscious show us a deeply conflicted sense of self. Flashbacks of an alcoholic father mix with sexual fantasies of the lovely Lola but quickly reveal that mom's in bed, too. During a quick trip to the suburbs for a dinner with extended family, Hlynur, so comically disturbed by the mundane family [[ritual]] (they actually gather to watch a video of last year's family dinner), imagines a [[bloodbath]] scene killing everyone at close range with a shotgun. When brought back to reality, Hlynur's blank slate and effortless personality come back into the fore: "I was thinking what a nice couch you have", he explains to the previously slaughtered family.  Hlynur's confusion over the whole situation is expressed in his rather profound and imaginative musings:  <blockquote> ''There they are...my mother the lesbian, and my father the boozer. What am I then? The offspring of a lesbian and a boozer? It's like two birds of different species. The lesbian bird and the boozer bird. The boozer is a wetland bird. He's rather heavy...and needs a good run-up to get off the ground. He can fly for a long time and has good stamina. Several weeks may pass by before he gets back on the ground. In between he lies low and goes on the defensive. Especially for the first days after landing. The lesbian. Unlike the boozer...the lesbian is a relative newcomer to Icelandic nature. She is thought to have migrated from Denmark and Britain. Her only contact with the male bird is during conception. In recent years we have witnessed cases of male birds...who are unable to fly at all. The offspring of a boozer and a lesbian is the Hlynur...an unusually slow developer that can't fly... and remains with his mother for the first 30 years. The Hlynur is defensive by nature, but harmless.'' </blockquote>  The film progresses as Hlynur comes to terms with his mother's love for Lola and his own feelings of inadequacy with her. The announcement that Lola is [[pregnant]] pushes him to the brink, making living under the same roof next to impossible for all three; but after a lot of acting out and flippant commentary, Hlynur begins to see life little differently. Hylnur also begins engaging in more activities outside his home and eventually finds himself a fitting job as well as the affections of a woman his age who has broken up with her unfaithful boyfriend. The infant's arrival also symbolically coincides neatly with Hlynur's homecoming to the world outside his bedroom and a newfound contentedness. The strong possibility that he is the father of Lola's child has been a secret between Lola and Hlynur, and this is more than hinted at in the closing scenes of the happy household composed of mother, son, Lola, and Lola's baby who calls him Papa.

405 (film)
 On an otherwise ordinary day in [[Los Angeles]], [[air traffic control]]lers in contact with [[American Airlines]] Flight 117 have the flight appear on a radar screen. The air traffic controllers instruct the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] airliner to make an [[emergency landing]] at [[Los Angeles International Airport]].   The flight crew responds by saying that it is unable to maintain altitude, and begin an emergency descent. Meanwhile, during a traffic report, a man is driving a [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] down a mysteriously empty stretch of [[Interstate 405 (California)|I-405]] as a two-mile stretch was shut down to be used as the airliner's emergency landing strip. Soon, AA Flight 117 appears on its final landing approach while the driver of the Jeep attempts to outrun the incoming DC-10.   During touchdown, the airliner's nose gear collides with the back of the Jeep with the nose gear collapsing, and the fuselage slamming onto the Jeep's roof. The two vehicles are locked together, pushing the Jeep to a much higher speed. The driver tries to slow the careening aircraft but in the process of slowing down, the DC-10 and the man's car narrowly miss an elderly woman driving slowly in her [[Lincoln Continental]]. While sliding to a stop, the massive aircraft with the trapped Jeep pass over the hapless woman's car.  The incident ends with [[police car]]s arriving; at that point, the elderly woman drives slowly past, extending her middle finger at the Jeep's driver.

As the vehicles leave the embassy, Peter sees his brother and waves goodbye. Suddenly, a rocket hits one of the vehicles, flipping it on to Greg's vehicle. All of the officers are killed by sniper fire. Kelvin, in the car behind Greg's, sits quietly while everyone else panics. A devastated Peter follows Ronald as he chases the sniper, but find himself running ahead of the officers. The sniper fires at Peter until he runs out of bullets. Meanwhile, Peter knowing the sniper is out, attacks him. Kelvin arrives and is about to shoot Peter when [[Police Tactical Unit (Hong Kong)|PTU]] officers show up. Kelvin then pretends to help Peter while the sniper escapes. Kelvin offers his help and gives Peter his number.  As Peter drives home with Janet, he notices a car following them. He confronts the driver, who turns out to be Eric. He reveals he is a Singaporean agent and asks Peter to help him investigate his brother's death. When Peter gets home, he finds that the house is swarming with police as part of the investigation. An officer breaks a large vase, spilling coins all over the floor. Salina arrives with her friend, a judge, who prevents further searching. When the coins are later cleaned up, a key to Greg's safe deposit box is found. Salina advises Peter to check the contents right away. She helps him forge his brother's identity, and they find it holds a metal briefcase. They take the briefcase, but are arrested by Ronald outside the bank.  While being driven away the GSU vehicles are attacked by assailants trying to steal the briefcase. In the gun battle several are killed, including Ronald. Just before he dies, Ronald warns Peter about Salina. Peter is forced to kill an assailant, while the sniper from earlier is stopped by Eric, who had just arrived. In the car, Salina opens the briefcase and finds a safe deposit box key for the Singapore National Bank. Peter decides to go to Singapore with Salina, despite Eric's objections. Eric tells Colonel Ng he believes the GSU were attacked by Kelvin, while confirming Peter's innocence and his suspicions about Salina. Colonel Ng is upset about his involvement in the gun battle and demands he returns to Singapore.  Peter's locks the key in the hotel room's safe. He obviously distrusts Salina, while she becomes colder. They have a confrontation over dinner and Peter demands to know her identity. However, Salina tearfully reveals her car thief skills from being a hooker in a night club, where she met Greg.  On the following morning, Salina and the key are missing. The others rush to the bank, where they see Salina leaving the bank, accompanied by the man Peter recognises as the sniper who shot his brother. The two leave in a red vehicle, while the others rush out to get help from some nearby policemen. Frustrated, Peter steals the police car while Bobby stops the policeman, who calls for backup. Eric hears the radio message and rushes to the scene. Peter chases the car to the [[Boat Quay]], where he rams it.  Eric and three other officers intercepts the sniper's car and have a gun battle. As Peter reaches the scene, Salina fires at his feet to stop him. A speedboat is hijacked and all three, including Salina, escape up the [[Singapore River]]. Eric tells Peter and his friends that they need to go back to Hong Kong and Eric asks Peter not to reveal his identity.  The contents of the safe are shown to Kelvin, but it only contains items of sentimental value to Salina. Disgusted, he reminds her that she belongs to him, she was the one who stole the Caller Program. He threatens to kill her, erasing all evidence. At the airport, Bobby finds a mysterious program implanted on his laptop. Alex successfully completes the Caller Program, and destroys the data for several organizations, including the Stock Exchange and National Bank, their intended target. Kelvin is upset that the second part will take a month to finish. He gets a call from an unsuspecting Peter, who tells him about the program in Bobby's laptop and asks for his assistance.  They arrange to meet at a hotel, where the sniper is positioned on a nearby rooftop. A waiter offers them water and Peter is surprised to see it is Eric. With increased confidence, he demands information on Salina and his brother's killer. Kelvin asks that they move to a quieter area. While on the way out, he pokes gun in Peter's back, who finally realizes who his brother's killer really is. Eric pursues and they fight on the hotel roof. The sniper pins Eric down. As they fight for the laptop, Peter falls off the roof, but is saved by a window washing platform, while Kelvin escapes with the laptop. Bobby sees Kelvin leaving and tails him in a taxi.  Kelvin and two agents arrive at [[Suntec City]], where they meet Salina and four others. Bobby calls Peter to tell him where they are, but he loses the agents, only to be captured by them later. Peter and several officers arrive at the Convention Centre, but Eric receives a call from Colonel Ng, who surprises him by asking him to arrest all the American agents. He has confirmation that they are operating without approval. The agents find Alex at his computer where he reports he completed his task. Kelvin shoots him and is about to shoot Bobby when Salina points her gun at Kelvin. As the other agents react, one of them, who was sympathetic towards Salina, stops them. Salina and Bobby leave with the laptop.  Eric's men cover the exits. Salina and Bobby stay among the exhibits, while rogue agents hunt for them. Bobby tells Peter their location and they rush in to help. Kelvin sees the officers and Peter converging on Bobby's hideout. Kelvin and the sniper sneak up on Bobby and Salina, who start to struggle, causing Bobby to be shot by Kelvin, sparking mayhem. Kelvin grabs the laptop and tries to escape. He takes some civilians hostage and forces them to run the software. He shoots a hostage and the police are forced to withdraw.  In a fit of rage, Peter rushes Kelvin and is shot. He is able to aim his gun at Kelvin, but hesitates and Kelvin triggers the program's deletion process, which reveals a snapshot of Peter and Bobby, a hoax they planted instead of the program. Peter takes a shot at Kelvin, but the gun jams. The closing scenes show Peter with paramedics outside the Convention Centre. The sniper is seen quietly walking away from the crowd. Salina compliments Bobby for his bravery while on the way to the hospital.

A.LI.CE
  In the year 2000, shortly after her best friend's sudden suicide, a Japanese schoolgirl named Alice wins a competition to be the youngest person ever to be sent into space, on a semi-commercial space airline. However, something goes wrong during the flight, and the shuttle crashes, killing all on board except for Alice and the stewardess robot, SS1X. Finding themselves in a desolate, snowy landscape, they set out to find help.  A young man named Yuan aids them, and reveals that they are in Lapland, the year is 2030, and the world's population is only one billion. At first he does not believe their claims to be from 30 years in the past. Yuan helps Alice and SS1X avoid the army which appears and begins pursuing her. Together they find enough old newspapers to discover what has happened in the years they have missed. A dictator known as Nero, and his computer named SS10X, have apparently been systematically capturing people and removing them to concentration camps, thus erasing all but one billion people. Most towns are empty and technology is old and decaying.  It is revealed that the pursuing army is the Liberation Army, who directly oppose Nero. Alice, Yuan, and SS1X are captured and taken to the army's centre of operations. There, it is revealed that there is a mysterious connection between Alice and Nero's computer, and that, as a result, only Alice is able to hack into the computer and disable Nero's security systems. The Liberation Army plan to disable all the security and storm Nero's base to assassinate him and end his dictatorship. Alice agrees to hack the computer for the Liberation Army, despite being warned that it will be at great risk to herself. She uses a virtual reality device to float through the workings of the computer, disabling much of its workings but causing her mind great pain. With the automated security turned off, the Liberation Army sends all their troops to Nero's base for their final assault.  Yuan and SS1X, meanwhile, escape from their imprisonment and race to stop Alice from hacking any further before she causes herself serious harm. Alice, aware that her connection to Nero's computer, SS10X, is not a coincidence, says that she feels she needs to finally meet Nero. They all travel to Nero's base, narrowly avoiding the security systems which are just beginning to reactivate. The entirety of the Liberation Army are killed by the security robots, except for its leader, Kaspar.  Kaspar reveals that it was he who sabotagued Alice's space flight by replacing her space shuttle with a duplicate which contained a hidden time machine but was otherwise identical to the original. Kaspar had realised that Nero was the only person other than Kaspar himself potentially capable of building a time machine of his own, so he brought the only person compatible with Nero's SS10X computer, Alice, from the past to destroy Nero before he ever had the chance to build his own time machine. By removing Nero, his only obstacle, Kaspar intends to use his time machine to insert himself into key moments of history so that he is ultimately seen as a god.  Nero's security system manages to activate enough to impale and kill the megalomaniac Kaspar, however, not before Kaspar fires shots into Nero's huge computer, causing the beginning of its destruction. Alice finally approaches Nero himself, who reveals that he is her son. He explains that Alice fell into a coma shortly after his birth, and that despite his genius intellect, he only ever wanted nothing more than to communicate with her. He built his computer, based on the SS1X model Alice had known as the stewardess on her space flight, in an effort to see into the mind of the comatose Alice. This is why Alice is the only person able to hack the computer: it is tuned only to her mind.  Unfortunately, in her coma, the older Alice only mentally repeats the last words of her best friend who had committed suicide in the year 2000. Her friend had mused that the sky was not as blue as it should be, due to the pollution caused by [[human overpopulation]]. Acting on this, the SS10X computer began to decrease the human population to bring about a natural blue sky. Nero was never the dictator responsible for the wasteland of 2030, but the unconscious and unaware Alice was.  As the massive computer begins to fall apart, Alice begs Nero to escape with her. However, he says that having finally spoken with his mother, he is happy at last. He realises that his attempt to reach his mother inadvertently brought about a dictatorship and mass destruction, so he chooses to die rather than escape. Alice flees the base with Yuan and SS1X just as the destruction of SS10X reaches its peak. In the heart of the enormous computer, the suspended, comatose body of an older Alice is glimpsed.  Alice uses the space shuttle, with its time machine, to travel back to 2000. She intends to prevent the terrible future she has seen. Meanwhile, SS1X reveals to Yuan that she found data log files in Nero's base that reveal where the missing seven billion people are being kept, and that together they can rescue them all, including Yuan's parents. As Alice flies back into the past, she reflects on all she has experienced before passing out from the high forces of atmospheric re-entry. The shuttle lands safely in the ocean, and a rescue crew manage to break into the hull. As she awakens, the first thing Alice sees is a young member of the rescue crew, holding his hand out to her, wearing the same necklace that Nero wore. The film ends as she smiles and reaches for his hand.<ref></ref>

Adagio (film)
 The story of the tragedy, an innovator - the leader, the prophet, the consequences of joining the world of new ideas and about how distorted the followers of the search of eternal truths can be. Throughout the cartoon sounds the [[Adagio in G minor]] (commonly attributed to the composer [[Tomaso Albinoni]]).  
Ácratas
  The documentary covers two cities, [[Montevideo]] and [[Buenos Aires]], primarily in the 1920s and 1930s, and the men of action who migrated in from [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[Russia]] and elsewhere during this time. These romantic gunmen committed their acts, not for personal gain but to fight against a regime they perceived as oppressive and repressive.  It focuses, in particular, on [[Miguel Arcángel Roscigna]] who was considered the most intelligent and reflective member of the "expropriating anarchist" movement, as he always had a detailed plan of action before attacking. Correctly or not, the film shows him participating in famous events, such as the assault on Messina Change in Montevideo or escaping the prison of [[Punta Carretas]] in 1931 where, 40 years later, the [[Tupamaro]] gas attack took place (today, it is a mall.) The film demonstrates how the media of the time printed or broadcast sensational stories about the group's activities, and dogged them. The documentary also shows how internal differences of opinion divided the group, and indeed many of his colleagues did not approve of Roscigna's peaceful activities.  
Actors (film)

Karen is sent to a special lighthouse to bring Rocky and Bullwinkle to the real world by literally [[Green-light|greenlighting]] a film starring the pair. She succeeds, with the Narrator being brought along as well but [[Unseen character|never being physically seen]].

The three are put on trial, where Bullwinkle inadvertently sabotages their case by cross-examining Karen as the prosecutor, not the defense attorney. However, the presiding Judge Cameo dismisses their case upon recognizing Rocky and Bullwinkle, stating to the [[district attorney]] that celebrities are [[wiktionary:above the law|above the law]].  The three obtain a [[biplane]] from a man named Old Jeb and evade Boris and Natasha once again. The duo consider quitting their evil occupations and getting married, but are interrupted by a call from Fearless Leader.

The heroes convince the American public to vote for whomever they want, as well as replant Frostbite Falls' trees. Bullwinkle accidentally activates the CDI, and zaps Boris, Natasha and Fearless Leader, reverting them back to their two-dimensional animated cartoon forms and banishing them to the Internet once and for all.

With no home, John asks his best friend Lacey Rawlins to leave his family ranch in San Angelo, Texas and join him to travel on horseback to cross the border 150 miles south, to seek work in [[Mexico]]. They encounter a peculiar 13-year-old boy named Jimmy Blevins on the trail to Mexico, whom they befriend but from whom they then separate. Later on they meet a young aristocrat's daughter, Alejandra Villarreal, with whom Cole falls in love.  Cole and Rawlins become hired hands for Alejandra's father, who likes their work, but Cole's romantic interest in Alejandra is  not welcomed by her wealthy aunt. After Alejandra's father takes her away, Cole and Rawlins are arrested by Mexican police and taken to jail, where they again encounter Blevins, who has been accused of stealing a horse and of murder, and is killed by a corrupt police captain. Cole and Rawlins are sent to a Mexican prison for abetting Blevins' crimes, where they must defend themselves against dangerous inmates. The pair are both nearly killed.  Alejandra's aunt frees Cole and Rawlins, on the condition that she never sees them again. While Rawlins returns to his parents' ranch in Texas, Cole attempts to reunite with Alejandra over her family's objections. Her aunt is confident that Alejandra will keep her word and not get back together with Cole–so much so that she even gives Cole her niece's phone number. Cole urges Alejandra to come to Texas with him. She, however, decides she must keep her word and though she loves him, she will not go with him.  Cole then sets out to get revenge on the captain who took the Blevins boy's life, as well as to get back his, Lacey's and Blevins' horses. After making the captain his prisoner, he turns him over to Mexican men, including one with whom Cole had previously shared a cell when they were imprisoned by the captain. Cole is spared the decision to kill the captain, but it is implied the men whom the captain was turned over to will do that.  Reentering the USA and riding through a small town in Texas, towing two horses behind the one he is riding, he stops to inquire what day it is (it is Thanksgiving Day). He asks a couple of men if they would be interested in buying a rifle, as he needs the money. One is a sheriff's deputy and arrests him because all three horses have different brands, and they suspect Cole is a horse thief.  In court, Cole tells the judge his story from the beginning. The judge believes him and orders Cole freed and the horses returned to him. Later that evening, Cole shows up at the judge's home, troubled. The judge had said good things about him in court, but Cole feels guilty that Blevins was killed–and while there was nothing he could have done to prevent the killing, he never even spoke up at the time and is upset with himself for that. The judge tells him he is being too hard on himself and it could not have been helped; he must go on and live his life. Cole rides to Rawlins' family's ranch, where he asks his friend if he wants his horse back.  
Ali Zaoua
 Against a background of dockside poverty in Casablanca, populated by a loose gang of over 20 homeless and uneducated male youths under 15, Kwita ([[Maunim Kbab]]), Omar ([[Mustapha Hansali]]), Boubker ([[Hicham Moussaune]]) and Ali Zaoua ([[Abdelhak Zhayra]]) leave the group becoming 4 independents. Ali, with plans of becoming a cabin boy on a ship, leads this exodus from the gang — led by Dib ([[Saïd Taghmaoui]]). Early in the film and almost accidentally, Ali is killed by members of the gang. His 3 outsider friends decide to give him a proper funeral. Kwita is treated badly by military, by police and by well-off children because he is "not devout", cannot pray, is unclean, smells like dead meat and is a glue sniffer, and Omar attempts to return to Dib's gang. Boubker, the smallest and most irrepressibly buoyant of the boys, temporarily despairs, but recovers. Against all odds, the three boys manage to arrange Ali's funeral to pay respect to their friend in the main story of the film.  
Almost Famous
  In 1969, child prodigy William Miller struggles to fit in. His widowed mother, Elaine, has led him to believe he is thirteen years old until William's older sister, Anita, insists their mother tell him the truth: William is actually eleven. His mother started him in first grade at five years old, and he skipped fifth grade. Elaine strictly forbids [[rock music]] and other unwelcome influences on her children, driving Anita to leave home at eighteen to become a flight attendant.  In 1973, William, now fifteen, influenced by his sister's secret cache of rock albums, aspires to be a rock journalist, writing freelance articles for underground papers in [[San Diego]]. Rock journalist [[Lester Bangs]], impressed with his writing, gives him a $35 assignment to review a [[Black Sabbath]] concert. William is barred from backstage, but when the opening band Stillwater arrives, William flatters his way in. Lead guitarist Russell Hammond takes a liking to him, partly because of William's new acquaintance with veteran [[groupie]] Penny Lane, who takes William under her wing.  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' editor [[Ben Fong-Torres]], believing William is older, hires him sight unseen to write an article about Stillwater and sends William on the road with the band. William interviews the members, but Russell repeatedly puts him off. Tensions between Russell and lead singer Jeff Bebe soon become evident. William, jokingly called "the enemy" because he is a journalist, begins losing his objectivity as he integrates himself into their inner circle.  The band experiences problems with promoters and venues on the tour, and hires Dennis, a professional manager. Penny has to leave before the band reaches New York, where Russell's ex-wife-girlfriend Leslie will join them. Stillwater "loses" Penny and her three protégé groupies to another band in a poker game; Penny acts nonchalant about it but is devastated. Meanwhile, Dennis charters a small plane so the band can play more gigs.  Penny goes to New York on her own and shows up at the restaurant where William informs the band that they will be featured on the cover of ''Rolling Stone''. Leslie notices Penny attempting to get Russell's attention, and Penny is asked to leave. William chases her back to her hotel, where he saves her from overdosing on [[methaqualone|quaaludes]].  The next day, the band flies to another gig, and the plane encounters severe weather. Believing they are about to die, band members confess their secrets to one another, while Jeff and Russell's conflicts are thrust into the open. Jeff insults Penny, but William defends her and confesses that he loves her. The plane lands safely in [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]], leaving everyone to ponder the changed atmosphere.  William goes to the ''Rolling Stone'' office in [[San Francisco]] to finish the article. Fearful that the band's image will damaged, Russell tells the magazine's fact-checker the story is untrue, killing the article and crushing William. Anita encounters a dejected William in the airport and offers to take him anywhere in the world; he chooses to go home to San Diego, where their mother is overcome by their return.  One of the groupies chastises Russell for betraying William. Russell calls Penny and asks to meet with her, but she tricks him, giving him William's home address instead. He arrives and finds himself face-to-face with William's mother, who scolds him for his behavior. Russell apologizes to William and finally gives him his interview. Russell has confirmed William's article to ''Rolling Stone'', which runs it as a cover feature. Penny fulfills her long-standing fantasy to fly to Morocco. Stillwater again tours only by bus.   
Amores perros

Octavio tries to persuade her to run away with him. Local thug Jarocho, happy after winning in a [[dogfight]], lets his dog loose on some strays and is threatened by a vagrant wielding a [[machete]].

Made aware of this by his friend Jorge and needing money to start his new life with Susana, Octavio decides to become involved in the dogfighting scene. Jarocho keeps entering new dogs into the fights, only for Cofi to kill them. Octavio makes enough money to flee with Susana, and pays Mauricio, the owner of the dogfighting venue, to get Ramiro beaten up. In revenge, Ramiro steals the money and leaves with Susana. Struggling financially, Octavio accepts a challenge by Jarocho to participate in a private fight, with no outside bets. Cofi is about to win, but Jarocho shoots the dog.

A collision follows; Jorge dies and Octavio is badly injured. ;'''Daniel y Valeria''' Magazine publisher Daniel ([[Álvaro Guerrero]]) leaves his family to live with his lover Valeria ([[Goya Toledo]]), a [[Spain|Spanish]] supermodel. On the day they move in together, Valeria's leg is severely broken in the car accident and is unable to continue working as a model. One day, as Valeria is recuperating in Daniel's apartment, her dog Richie disappears under a broken floorboard and stays there for days. The missing dog triggers serious tension for the couple, causing numerous fights which lead to doubts about their relationship on both sides. Daniel calls his estranged wife to hear her voice, suggesting that he regrets leaving her for Valeria. Trying to help the dog, Valeria reinjures her leg; Daniel finds her hours later, resulting in severe arterial thrombosis and eventually [[gangrene]]. The leg is [[amputation|amputated]], ending Valeria's modeling career for good. While she is in the hospital, Daniel rescues Richie from the floorboards. However, Valeria realizes that her life is ruined. She quietly drives her wheelchair through the torn-up lovenest and looks out of the window expecting to see a billboard bearing her likeness, only to find it has been removed. ;'''El Chivo y Maru''' The vagrant occasionally seen in the previous segments is revealed to be a professional [[contract killer|hitman]] named El Chivo ([[Emilio Echevarría]]). Leonardo, a corrupt police commander, recounts that El Chivo is a former private school teacher who was imprisoned after committing terrorist acts for [[guerilla]] movements. When he got out, Leonardo started getting him jobs as a hitman. El Chivo tries to make contact with his daughter, Maru, whom he abandoned when he began his guerrilla involvement. Following El Chivo's wishes, Maru's mother tells her that her father is dead. El Chivo is about to perform a hit on a businessman when the car crash interrupts him. During the chaos at the crash scene, El Chivo steals Octavio's money and takes the wounded Cofi to his home to nurse it back to health. One day, while El Chivo is away from his warehouse hideout, Cofi kills the other mongrel dogs he is caring for. Despite initially preparing to kill Cofi, El Chivo figures that the dog does not know any better and that its violence is a reflection of his own life as a hitman. Meanwhile, Ramiro is shot and killed by Leonardo's [[Plainclothes law enforcement|plain-clothes]] bodyguard during an attempted bank robbery.   At Ramiro's funeral, a seriously injured Octavio sees Susana for the first time since she and Ramiro fled with his money. Despite having been wronged, Octavio tries again to convince Susana to run away with him, but she becomes angry with the fact that Octavio is willing to run away with her after she has just lost a loved one. A few days later, Octavio is shown waiting at the bus station for Susana. She never shows, and Octavio does not get onto the bus. Still grieving for his other dogs, El Chivo learns that his client and his intended victim are half-brothers. He leaves both men alive and chained to separate walls with a pistol within reach between them, their fate left undetermined. El Chivo then breaks into his daughter's house and leaves her a large bundle of money along with a message on her answering machine explaining what happened to him and why the family was split. Just before El Chivo is to tell his daughter Maru that he loves her, the answering machine stops recording. He then goes to an autoshop, where he sells the client's SUV. The mechanic asks him the dog's name, and El Chivo calls him "Negro" ("Black"). After El Chivo receives the money for the car, he and Negro walk away, disappearing into the horizon.  
Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman
 The movie begins with Alvin having nightmares of meeting the [[Werewolf|Wolfman]], leading to him wake up screaming in fear. Simon and Dave conclude that Alvin's been watching too many horror films at night. Alvin says that it is because their new neighbor, Lawrence Talbot, creeps him out and speculates that he is hiding something. Theodore is having trouble with Nathan, a bully, and will not go to the principal, who plans to retire due to Alvin's daily mishaps, for help. However, Alvin sticks up for him.  Their school is rehearsing the play for the famous horror story ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. When yet another accident caused by Alvin when mixing unknown chemicals that result in a huge explosion and mess of the school auditorium, Principal Milliken and Dave decide that Alvin be pulled out of his role as Mr. Hyde. To boost his self-esteem, they decide to have Theodore replace the role. Meanwhile, Alvin and Simon are out in search of proof of werewolves (''Munks on a Mission''). Meanwhile, no one believes that Theodore is scary enough to play the role of Mr. Hyde. However, that all changes after he gets bit by a large dog (later finding out it was a [[werewolf]]) on his way home after giving a necklace as a gift to Eleanor, whom he is harboring a secret crush on. The next day at the rehearsal, Theodore does an extremely terrifying impression of Mr. Hyde. Despite this triumph, Theodore's personality continues to drastically change, becoming more vicious and mean. With their brother now a werewolf, Alvin and Simon search for a way to help Theodore and save the school play without Dave finding out the truth (''Monster Out in You'').   Despite their best efforts, they find no solution. They eventually decide to take up some advice from known psychic Madame Raya. She says that Theodore is already close to the animal state and will turn into a werewolf soon enough. Simon and Alvin ask her if there is any way to cure him. She suggests knocking him with a silver cane while he is still a "puppy" before the next full moon when the transformation will be complete. Heeding this advice, Alvin breaks into Mr. Talbot's home and steals his silver cane. However, as he runs away with it, he knocks into Dave. That night, Dave goes to see Mr. Talbot to apologize and explain everything to him. However, during the conversation, the full moon rises and he transforms into a werewolf. Terrified, Dave runs to the school to warn the boys. However, he runs into a pole, knocking him unconscious. Having followed Dave to the school, Mr. Talbot makes his way inside.   During the play, Theodore changes into a werewolf while on set and starts to attack Eleanor. However, after cornering her, the necklace Theodore gave her earlier shines by the moon, causing Theodore to remember his feelings towards her and to flee. Eleanor follows him, determined to help him, only to almost be attacked by Mr. Talbot, who was the original werewolf that bit Theodore. Theodore quickly defends her and attacks Mr. Talbot, biting him during the struggle. As a result of the bite, Mr. Talbot changes back into a human and Theodore back into a chipmunk. Confused by what happened, Simon explains to everyone how the bite cured them by causing the effect to reverse on them both. With the happy news delivered, Alvin quickly runs up to the stage to join in the applause by the crowd, who believes the entire incident was just an act.   At the wrap party, they find out Mr. Talbot is going to be their new principal. Having woke up, Dave shows up as he gives his speech about his new position and nearly attacks him. The boys quickly explain that Theodore took care of everything (leaving out most of the film's events), leaving Dave impressed and proud of him. As Dave hugs Theodore, Mr. Talbot thanks him. The Chipmunks and Chipettes end the wrap party by doing their famous performances, and soon everyone else follow the rhythm as the movie ends with ''Everything's Gonna Be Alright''.

He agrees.  The devil makes the game delayed thanks to rain, and Eddie leaves to see Laurel's ballet recital. To get him to the game faster, Bob speeds up the recital. When he gets to the game, the Crimson Devils are up 2-0 in the bottom of the eighth inning. The Angels soon score three runs thanks to a [[home run]] by a player who had a demon holding him back. When Laurel asks Bob why he didn't do anything about it, he replies that the angels aren't allowed to help in championships. When the ninth inning comes, Eddie gets two quick outs, but then a player hits a triple. Then, Fleck who blew the game for him in his rookie year comes to the plate, and he asks God what to do, then Bob comes up to him on the mound and tells him that his angel just arrived, and he looks in the stands to see Claire standing there. After this, he pitches to him, and he hits a ground ball just like the one he hit in their rookie year, but this time, he manages to get it, and he throws it to first to end the game, and save his career. He hugs Laurel after the game, and kisses Claire.

April Captains
 The film opens on the evening of 24 April 1974, as a young conscript soldier (Daniel) kisses farewell to his girlfriend (Rosa) before boarding a train from Lisbon back to his Army base at [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarem]]. Both are fearful that he will be sent to fight in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]]. Late and depressed, Rosa then travels by [[Trams in Lisbon|tram]] to Antonia's flat to babysit for her daughter Amelia. On arriving back (late) at his base, Daniel is oblivious to the imminent [[Coup d'état|coup]]. Captain [[Salgueiro Maia]] arrests the base commander at gunpoint and orders the soldiers to assemble on parade in the middle of the night; he asks them to come with him to Lisbon to overthrow the government. Maia's erudite but cynical and cautious colleague Major Gervasio refuses to take part, as does Lieutenant Lobão.  Meanwhile, in [[Lisbon]], left-wing journalist/lecturer Antonia is having a row with her estranged husband Manuel, a [[Portuguese Army]] captain, over atrocities he has been involved with during the Colonial War. Rosa having arrived to babysit, Antonia then goes to a formal reception where she pleads with her brother (Filipe Correia), a minister in the government, to release one of her students who had been arrested by the [[PIDE#DGS|DGS (secret police)]]. Filipe refuses to help and returns to his conversation with General Pais. The head of the DGS (Salieri) is also present at the reception; he recognises Antonia and subsequently assaults her in a toilet. Antonia returns home in despair, not realising that her estranged husband Manuel is also a coup plotter. Manuel and his colleague prepare to seize control of the Rádio Clube Português, a radio station, from which communiques on behalf of the [[Armed Forces Movement]] will be broadcast.   Meanwhile, simultaneously, Maia and his troops are preparing to set off for Lisbon, and the other coup plotters are also preparing to move into position. The signal for the coup to start is the playing of [[Grandola, Vila Morena]] on the radio shortly after midnight on 25 April. Maia's troops set off in a column of armoured vehicles. Manuel, Fonseca, Botelho and Silva capture the Rádio Clube Português in Lisbon. A signal is given by morse code by car headlights to prisoners being held in prison by the DGS. Maia's armoured column has to stop in open countryside due to a breakdown by one of the key armoured vehicles; at this point Major Gervasio arrives in a conspicuous red sports car and joins the rebels. Maia's troops arrive in the [[Praça do Comércio]] in Lisbon, but are threatened by a naval warship and by a column of tanks commanded by General Pais (who remains loyal to the regime). Following a stand-off, with Labão and Maia both threatened with being shot, many of Pais' troops defect to the rebels. On entering the Government offices in the Praca do Comercio, Maia discovers that the ministers have fled to the [[Republican National Guard (Portugal)|GNR]] headquarters at [[Carmo Convent (Lisbon)|Carmo]] in Lisbon. There are several asides, including where the young conscript soldier in the opening scenes of the film meets Rosa again, placing a carnation in the barrel of his rifle (and are later discovered inside a military armoured car whilst making love).   At the GNR barracks, a further stand-off ensues, with the regime leaders (including [[Marcelo Caetano]]) trapped inside. Also trapped in their nearby headquarters, a group of DGS officers open fire from the windows at the crowd in the street outside, killing four - the only fatalities of the Carnation Revolution. Virgilio is one of the casualties. Maia eventually ordering his troops to shoot at the building with machine-gun fire. Following this atrocity, Maia threatens to blow up the building with artillery.   Shortly before Maia's deadline expires, emissaries from General [[Antonio Spinola]] arrive, to negotiate the surrender of the regime's leaders. Spinola himself arrives, places Gervásio in local command (despite having spent almost the entire day avoiding any action) and orders Maia to convey the arrested Caetano, Correira and the other leaders to an air force base, from whence they are flown to [[Madeira]] and then on to exile in [[Brazil]]. The film closes with the release of the political prisoners, including Antonia's lover (Emilio), and Manuel and Maia narrowly avoid being attacked by a crowd when they are mistaken for DGS/PIDE officers rather than soldiers.   It is then revealed that Antonia and Emilio will both go into politics, she on the left but he ultimately on the centre-right; after two years together they separate. Manuel will drift into alcoholism and Maia was to die from cancer in his late 40s. Nevertheless, the revolution leads to the downfall of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime and its replacement by democracy and the rule of law for Portugal.

[[foreign aid|aid money]], in exchange for continuing negotiations with [[South Korea]].  Shortly after being discovered, Shaw fights his way out of the party, and suffers a gunshot wound to his shoulder during extraction.   Six months later, a shipping container full of dead [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] refugees from Hong Kong turns up on the New York docks on the week as [[People's Republic of China|China]]'s trade agreement with the U.S. Shaw's boss, Eleanor Hooks (Archer) suspects Chinese ambassador Wu's (Hong) connection with the Chinese [[Triad society|Triad]], and assigns Shaw to plant a [[tracking device|bug]] on Wu during a banquet held by Chan.  During the trade agreement banquet, Wu is gunned down, Chan is shot in the arm, and Shaw pursues a masked gunman.  During the pursuit, Shaw's teammate Robert Bly (Biehn) supposedly corners the gunman, but perishes, and Shaw is arrested by the [[NYPD]].  In the middle of a prison transfer, FBI agent Frank Capella's (Chaykin) van is disabled by a roadside bomb, and an unconscious Shaw is captured by Triad members to be framed of the murder and disposed of.

Shaw kills the hitman, recovers the audio file, and secures weapons and equipment from Novak's hidden armory.  Shaw seeks out Julia Fang's (Matiko) help after reading a news article stating Shaw's innocence. Shaw manages to save Fang from an ambush by a Chinese hitwoman at a hospital.   With Fang's aid, Shaw finds a Triad-owned bakery serving as a front for a Gentleman's club, setting up an unlikely alliance with Capella, as well as retrieving video footage of Chan's role in derailing the trade agreement.  Fang delivers the evidence to Hooks while Shaw confronts Chan at the same hotel serving as the banquet. Chan is shot dead by a masked gunman while being interrogated by Shaw.

Bly reveals himself as the assassin at the banquet, and also engineered the tracking device implant from an earlier basketball game injury.  Hooks reviews the evidence, and reveals that she and Chan were the masterminds behind the conspiracy. A disgusted Fang tries to leave, but attempts to hide from Bly only to be locked in a bathroom.  Shaw eventually figures out Hooks's role behind the conspiracy and approaches Capella with his findings. Shaw uses Capella's business card to surgically remove his tracking device, and gives the Triads a business proposition.  Shaw breaks into the U.N. building, and enters into a shootout and hand-to-hand fight with Bly, where the latter dies after falling on a glass shard from a broken glass pane. The following day, Shaw calls Hooks in her limousine and lectures her on a lesson in [[karma]], revealing that Shaw's business proposition to the Triads was to assassinate Hooks for her betrayal.  Shaw later has his death faked before reuniting with Fang in France, but is monitored by an unknown spy.  
The Audition (2000 film)
   
Astitva

Malhar Kamat (played by [[Mohnish Bahl]]), an old musician and music teacher, is dying. He prepares his [[Will and testament|will]] where he leaves his entire ''jaydad'' (estate) &mdash; comprising a ''haveli'' (mansion),  of land, 1,400 grams of gold and approximately 800,000 rupees &mdash; to Aditi Shrikant Pandit ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]). Upon his death two years later, the will is delivered to Aditi.  When the will reaches Aditi in Pune, she is in the midst of an impromptu party occasioned by the arrival of Dr. Ravi Bapat ([[Ravindra Mankani]]) and his wife Meghna ([[Smita Jaykar]]). Ravi is a very close friend of Aditi's husband, Shrikant Pandit ([[Sachin Khedekar]]). Aditi and Shrikant's only child, Aniket ([[Sunil Barve]]) introduces his girlfriend and would-be wife Revati ([[Namrata Shirodkar]]) to everyone at the party.  Shrikant opens the certified package that contains the will, even though it is addressed to Aditi, much to Meghna's chagrin and Ravi's surprise. Shrikant is intrigued and refers to his diaries from 25 years ago, in which he has chronicled events from his daily life. He realises that Aditi could not have possibly been pregnant from him at that time, because he was travelling on work. He shows her the diary, confronts her with the facts, and demands an explanation.  In a flashback, Shrikant is an up-and-coming star at a firm, seeking to break out onto his own. His work keeps him traveling almost constantly. This leaves his newlywed wife Aditi lonely and frustrated.  When she asks him to let her work someplace (clearly to relieve her boredom and find a good use for her time), he takes it as an insult and rebuffs her saying no woman in his family has ever worked outside the home and that he earns enough for them to live comfortably. He suggests (although not very enthusiastically) that she take up music. The music teacher is Malhar Kamat. Shrikant continues his unending travels all over the world, although he makes it clear to Malhar that music will not be anything more than a hobby for Aditi.  Aditi's sister Sudha ([[Resham Tipnis]]) and her husband come to live with Aditi. Their constant lovemaking further deepens Aditi's feelings of yearning and abandonment. And one spring afternoon, as Malhar breaks into his new ''ghazal'' in the rain, Aditi's resolve is broken under the influence of the season. Malhar returns a couple of days later, and Aditi asks him to leave stating she loves only Shrikant. Aditi has missed a period. Sudha learns this and advises her to do something.  When Shrikant returns, Aditi breaks down and tries to tell him the truth about her pregnancy. But Shrikant is doubly elated, having won the first major contract for his own firm and, hearing of his imminent fatherhood, and breaks out into celebrations without letting Aditi complete her story.  As the story comes back to present time, Shrikant punishes Aditi by making her tell the truth in front of Aniket, Ravi and Meghna. Meghna loathes Shrikant, since she suffered spousal abuse from her drunkard husband before divorcing him and marrying Ravi. Aniket is disgusted with his mother after knowing the truth of his existence. Ravi confronts Shrikant stating Shrikant also committed sins many times if he thinks and states the one moment of weakness of Aditi as sin.Shrikant refuses to accept it stating he is a man and he doesn't bring any such child home.  Shrikant decides that he will live with Aditi, but any spousal relationship between them will not exist. After Revati knows the truth, she breaks the engagement, not because of the truth, but because she realizes that Aniket is no different than the man whom he considered his father till now.  Meghna decides to take Aditi to Goa with her, but Aditi declines.And before leaving the house she demands her husband and son's presences to hear her.She states how her weakness is called sin, whereas Shrikants weaknesses are accepted easily.She questions who has the authority to accept his weakness. And she reminds Shrikant the fact that they didn't have any other children which might be due to Shrikant,but then to she had always  loved him in spite of bearing no child with him.And how she could have been made responsible for that too if she didn't have child.Revati enters the house and gives her new generation views to Aniket stating he is alive as his mother didn't decide otherwise.Aditi walks out of the house with Revati. The movie ends with Revati and Aditi walking out the house and on the road, whilst Shri and Aniket stand in the doorway, watching them go.  The denouement captures the essence of ''astitva''.<ref></ref>  
Auggie Rose
 Life insurance salesman John Nolan ([[Jeff Goldblum]]) goes to the liquor store where he witnesses the fatal shooting of Auggie Rose ([[Kim Coates]]), an ex-convict on his second day as a stock boy. Auggie was returning from the back of the store with a bottle of wine John had requested – since the only bottle out front had a torn label – and he surprised the robber, who shot him in the stomach. John tries to comfort him, riding with him in the ambulance, but Auggie dies at the hospital.  Feeling responsible, and offended that the police show little interest in investigating and finding Auggie's next of kin, John finds out everything he can about Auggie, who was just released from prison after serving 20 years for armed robbery. Decker, the LAPD officer investigating the case ([[Richard T. Jones]]), warns him to back off. However, John becomes more and more engrossed with Auggie and disconnected from his own life, causing strain with his live-in girlfriend, Carol ([[Nancy Travis]]). After finding a stack of letters, he discovers that Auggie had a [[Southern United States|Southern]] pen pal named Lucy ([[Anne Heche]]) who is coming to meet him for the first time, unaware of Auggie's death, and is due to arrive the next day.  John tells his secretary, Noreen ([[Paige Moss]]), that he is taking a leave of absence. When John goes to meet Lucy, she greets him as Auggie, and he decides to pretend to be him. He lives in his apartment and starts a relationship with Lucy, and even applies for jobs as Auggie, getting a job as a stock boy at a small market. He meets ex-con Roy Mason ([[Timothy Olyphant]]), who knew Auggie through his cellmate but had never met him. Roy asks John to help him rob the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|L.A. Transit Authority]], which he says has $200,000 in cash daily and only two guards. John says he will consider it.  John trades in his [[Volvo]] for a motorcycle to complete his look. He happily spends his days at the market and nights with Lucy. Unbeknownst to him, however, both Roy and Decker are suspicious and tailing him. Roy retrieves John's business card from his Volvo at the dealership. Roy goes to John's office and sees a photo of him on the wall. He confronts John in the lobby of Auggie's apartment, and says he began spying on him when he didn't eagerly accept the transit heist, and that he had asked around and learned Auggie was dead. He accuses John of killing him to take his identity, which John denies, and Roy says he thinks John must be working some kind of life insurance scam. Roy threatens to tell Lucy and John punches him. Roy says he even knows about Carol before he leaves. John later gives Roy a forged insurance policy in Auggie's name worth $100,000 with a blank beneficiary, and tells him to take it and go away.  John continues to have dreams and flashbacks to the shooting, including dreams in which he is in Auggie's place and gets shot after coming out with the bottle of wine. Lucy confesses to John that she got married to someone she didn't love after she started writing Auggie, but that the marriage had been annulled after four months after her husband found all of the letters to Auggie. She says she felt she had to tell him because he was so much more than she thought he would be. John decides to tell Lucy the truth. Devastated, she leaves.   John decides to officially end his life as John Nolan, selling his half of the business to his partner, Carl ([[Casey Biggs]]). As he leaves the office, he runs into his partner with a couple, whom he recognizes from the market. They ask his advice about the plan Carl recommended, and John tells the husband, "I think you should go home and make love to your wife and pray that nothing bad happens, and ask yourself each day, 'if it were to end right here right now, would it be enough?'" John even has a headstone put up for himself with the inscription "Free at last." He informs Decker about Roy's plan to rob the Transit Authority, and Roy is arrested for violating his parole while trying to cash the life insurance policy.   John goes back to work at the market. He is sent to the back to retrieve a bottle of wine and pauses, coming out cautiously. Instead of a gunman, he sees Lucy, who greets him with, "Hi, Auggie."

Will admires the hats she made for the occasion and is surprised to learn that Charlotte is the daughter of one of his old girlfriends, Katy, who died in a car accident.  The next day, Will calls and asks Charlotte to make a hat for his date to an upcoming benefit dinner. A few days later, she delivers the hat to his apartment. Stood up by his date, he invites her to accompany him to the formal benefit. There they dance, get to know each other and later end up back at his apartment where they have sex. The next morning, while having breakfast on his terrace, Will explains that their relationship has no future. She acknowledges this, revealing she is dying from a heart condition. Later, Will tells his friend, John Volpe ([[Anthony LaPaglia]]), about his interest in Charlotte.  The next day, Will calls on Charlotte and they go out together. They talk about their age difference and her illness. As they walk through the beautiful fall foliage in [[Central Park]], Charlotte recites lines from the poem "God's World" by [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]]. As they talk, she notices him checking his watch, and she takes it from his wrist, saying she'll return it when he forgets that she has it. At his restaurant, they continue to get to know each other while preparing a meal for his staff. Watching her among his friends, he begins to fall in love.  Back at his apartment, Charlotte experiences severe heart pain. At the hospital, Will learns from the doctor that she is suffering from [[neuroblastoma]], a rare illness in adults, which in her case produced a tumor near her heart. She has perhaps a year to live. In the coming days, their relationship grows and she learns more about him. When she asks why he is so interested in food, Will responds, "Food is the only beautiful thing that truly nourishes."  At a Halloween party, Charlotte, dressed as [[Emily Dickinson]], entertains children by reciting lines from one of Dickinson's poems and bringing the words to life with butterflies on her fingers: "Two butterflies went out at noon and waltzed above a stream, then stepped straight through the firmament and rested on a beam; and then together bore away upon a shining sea – though never yet, in any port, their coming mentioned be." Meanwhile, in another room, Will meets a former girlfriend and the two end up on the roof having sex. Later, Charlotte suspects that he was unfaithful, and after denying it, he acknowledges his actions. Charlotte breaks off their relationship. They are both deeply affected by the breakup.  Meanwhile, Will receives a letter from Lisa Tyler ([[Vera Farmiga]]), the illegitimate daughter he's never met. He goes to the museum where she works and recognizes her from an old photo, but he is unable to approach her. A few nights later he arrives home and Lisa is waiting for him in the lobby; they talk for the first time. She is pregnant and has become sentimental about parenthood, wanting just to meet her own father. She tells him about a dream she's had, that he's been trying to find her all these years in order to say he was sorry for abandoning her. Will says quietly, "Yes I am."  The next day, Will is walking through Central Park and steps over a fence onto a path, leaving behind some children playing beneath a tree. That night, Charlotte returns to her apartment and finds Will asleep in her chair. Angry at first, she tells him to leave, but he apologizes and pleads to be given another chance – to let him love her again. She cries as he holds her in his arms, and later that night they make love. In the morning, Charlotte recites to him lines from a poem: "The stars are soft as flowers, and as near; the hills are webs of shadow, slowly spun; no separate leaf or single blade is here – all blend to one." Later, while skating at Rockefeller Center, Charlotte suddenly collapses on the ice. At the hospital, Will learns that the tumor has progressed and that she may only have a few weeks to live.  In the coming days, Will searches for a specialist who can perform the necessary heroic surgery to save her life. He turns to his daughter for help, and she finds a specialist who agrees to perform the surgery when the times comes. On Christmas morning, Charlotte wakes up and hears Will decorating the house and terrace. As she prepares to bring him his Christmas gift, Charlotte collapses. She is rushed to the hospital and the specialist is called. At the hospital, Will comes to her side and whispers to her lines from a poem: "Time cannot break the bird's wing from the bird. Bird and wing together go down, one feather. No thing that ever flew, not the lark, not you, can die as others do." Their hands separate as Charlotte is taken to the operating room.  Will, his friends, Lisa, and Charlotte's grandmother wait during the long hours of surgery. Outside the hospital, seagulls fly off into the snowy skies over the city. Finally, the specialist emerges from surgery, and as he approaches it is clear from his expression that he could not save her. Back at his apartment, Will finds Charlotte's Christmas gift lying on the floor – a small box with the hat stem she designed for him. Opening the box, he finds the watch she took from him on their first date. He stands at his window weeping, holding the box closely to his chest.  The following summer on a small boat on [[The Ramble and Lake, Central Park|Central Park Lake]], Will is holding his newborn grandson in his arms as his daughter Lisa looks on with a loving smile.

Bamboozled
 Pierre Delacroix (real name Peerless Dothan) is an uptight, [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-educated African-American man in the employment of television network CNS. At work, he endures torment from his boss Thomas Dunwitty, a tactless, boorish white man. Not only does Dunwitty use [[AAVE]] and the word "[[nigger]]" repeatedly in conversations, he also proudly proclaims that he is more black than Delacroix and that he can use "nigger" since he is [[interracial marriage|married to a colored woman]] and has two mixed-race children. Dunwitty frequently rejects Delacroix's scripts for series that portray black people in positive, intelligent scenarios, dismissing them as "[[The Cosby Show|Cosby clones]]".  In an effort to escape his contract through being fired, Delacroix develops a [[minstrel show]] with the help of his personal assistant Sloane Hopkins. ''Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show'' features black actors in [[blackface]], extremely racist jokes and puns, and offensively stereotyped [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]-animated cartoons. Delacroix and Hopkins recruit two impoverished street performers, Manray and Womack, to star in the show. While Womack is horrified when Delacroix tells him details about the show, Manray sees it as his big chance to become rich and famous for his tap-dancing skills.  To Delacroix's horror, not only does Dunwitty enthusiastically endorse the show, it also becomes hugely successful. As soon as it premieres, Manray and Womack become big stars, while Delacroix, contrary to his original stated intent, defends the show as [[satire]]. Delacroix quickly embraces the fame and recognition he receives while Hopkins becomes ashamed of her association with it. Meanwhile, an underground, militant [[rap music|rap]] group called the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Maus]], led by Hopkins' older brother Julius, becomes increasingly angry at the show's content. Though they had earlier unsuccessfully auditioned for the program's live band position, the group plans to end the show using violence.  Womack quits, fed up with the show and Manray's increasing [[megalomania|ego]]. Manray and Hopkins grow closer, despite Delacroix's attempts to sabotage their relationship. Delacroix confronts Hopkins, and when she lashes back at him, he fires her. She then shows him a videotaped [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] she created of racist footage culled from assorted media to shame Delacroix into stopping production of the show, but he refuses to watch it. After an argument with Delacroix, Manray realizes he is being exploited and defiantly announces that he will no longer wear blackface. He appears in front of the studio audience, who are all in blackface, and does his dance number in his regular clothing. The network executives immediately turn against Manray, and Dunwitty fires him.  The Mau Maus kidnap Manray and announce his public execution via live [[webcast]]. The authorities work feverishly to track down the source of the internet feed, but Manray is nevertheless assassinated while doing his famous tap dancing. At his office, Delacroix (now in blackface himself, mourning Manray's death) fantasizes that the various black-themed antique collectibles in his office are staring him down and coming to life; in a rage, he destroys many of the items. The police kill all the members of the Mau Maus except for One-Sixteenth Blak, a white member who demands to die with the others.  Furious, Hopkins confronts Delacroix at gunpoint and demands that he play her tape. As he does so, Hopkins reminds him of the lives that were ruined because of his actions. During a struggle over the gun, Delacroix is shot in the stomach. Hopkins flees while proclaiming that it was Delacroix's own fault that he got shot. Delacroix, holding the gun in his hands to make his wound appear self-inflicted, watches the tape as he lies dying on the floor. The film concludes with a long montage of racially insensitive and demeaning clips of African-American characters from [[Hollywood]] films of the first half of the 20th century.<ref>Some of the films used in the sequence are ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'', ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'', ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'', ''[[Judge Priest]], ''[[Ub Iwerks]]' cartoon ''[[Little Black Sambo]]'', [[Walter Lantz]]'s cartoon ''[[Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat]]'', the ''[[Screen Songs]]'' short ''Jingle Jangle Jungle'', the [[Merrie Melodies]] short ''[[All This and Rabbit Stew]]'', and, from the [[Hal Roach]] comedy ''School's Out'', ''[[Our Gang]]'' kids [[Allen "Farina" Hoskins]] and [[Matthew "Stymie" Beard]].</ref> Afterwards, Manray is shown doing his last ''Mantan'' sequence on stage.

The janitor comes back, only to discover his food missing.  As Yun-ju still struggles with maintaining the money to be a professor, he discovers Eun-sil has brought home another dog after being fired. Eun-sil shows more affection to the dog than her husband, even naming it "Baby," and treating Yun-ju like a servant. While in the park with Baby, Yun-ju is distracted, and the dog goes missing. When Eun-sil scolds him for losing the dog, Yun-ju finally snaps and accuses her of wasting money. However, she tears up and confesses she payed for the dog with severance money and wanted to use it to help Yun-ju become a professor, leaving him shocked and prompting him to find the pet. Yun-ju goes to Hyun-nam to print and hang posters for the missing dog. Yun-ju begins to give up his search when he learns nobody, not even the dog-eating janitor, has Baby.  As the search continues, Hyun-nam learns that the Granny passed away from the shock of losing her only family. Hyun-nam also receives a letter from Granny saying she can have the dried radishes which were left on the roof (seen at the beginning of the film). As Hyun-nam gathers the radishes, she discovers Baby on the roof, kidnapped by the homeless man with a newfound love for dog meat. She rescues the dog and a chase ensues. Jang-mi arrives and knocks the homeless man out, who is arrested by police, and Hyun-nam brings Baby back to Yun-ju.   Hyun-nam watches a TV broadcast on the missing dogs, but she finds nothing about herself, leaving her distraught that she has neither fame, nor a job. Later that night, Hyun-nam finds Yun-ju on the sidewalk. Yun-ju, overcome with guilt about the trouble he caused, finally confesses that he was the one who killed the dogs. However, Hyun-nam appears to forgive him for this.  Sometime later, Yun-ju is a successful professor and has a lot less trouble with his money and life. The film ends with Hyun-nam and Jang-mi taking a hike in some woods as the credits roll.

Noriko is the only student regularly attending class 3-B. Their teacher, Kitano, resigns after being wounded by a student.  One year later, class 3-B takes a field trip, but they are gassed and taken to a remote island. Kitano reappears surrounded by [[Japanese Self-Defense Forces|JSDF soldiers]], explaining to the class that they are chosen to participate in the annual Battle Royale as a result of the Act: they have three days to fight to the death until a victor emerges, while explosive collars will kill uncooperative students or those within daily "danger zones". Each student is provided rations, water, a map of the island, compass, and a random weapon.  The first six hours see twelve deaths, four by suicide, and most caused by the desperate, psychotic Mitsuko Souma and psychopathic volunteer Kazuo Kiriyama. Transfer student Shogo Kawada lets Shuya go, while basketball player Shinji Mimura plots to hack into the military's computer system to disrupt the program. Amid shifting loyalties and violent confrontations, Shuya promises to keep Noriko safe as his friend secretly loved her. He carries her to a clinic, where Kawada reveals that he won a previous Battle Royale at the cost of his girlfriend, Keiko Onuki, whose death he seeks to avenge. When Kiriyama attacks, Shuya entrusts Kawada to protect Noriko and runs as a distraction. Although saved by Hiroki Sugimura, a martial artist looking for Kayoko Kotohiki, Shuya is wounded.  Shuya awakens in the island's lighthouse, bandaged by female class representative Yukie, who has a crush on him.

Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker
 In [[Gotham City|Neo-Gotham City]] in 2040, the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] mysteriously resurfaces after having disappeared over thirty-five years ago, taking over a faction of the criminal gang [[Jokerz]]. Bruce Wayne, formerly [[Batman]] and was the Joker's archenemy, insists that the villain must be an impostor despite the evidence, claiming to have witnessed the Joker's death after their last battle. Later, Bruce's successor, [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]], and his girlfriend Dana are attacked by the Jokerz at a [[nightclub]] while the Joker simultaneously ambushes Bruce in the [[Batcave]], poisoning him with his trademark toxin and leaving him for dead.  At Terry's insistence, [[Barbara Gordon]] reluctantly tells him what really happened to the Joker - the reason she and Bruce believe him to be dead. [[The New Batman Adventures|Decades earlier]], after [[Nightwing#Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] ([[Dick Grayson]]) moved to the adjoining city of [[Blüdhaven]] to fight crime on his own, the Joker and [[Harley Quinn]] kidnapped [[Tim Drake]], Dick's successor as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], disfigured him to look like the Joker, and tortured him for three weeks, at which point Tim revealed Batman's secrets. After the Joker sadistically taunted both Tim and Batman himself, Batman furiously attacked the Joker in retaliation. During the final battle, although the Joker attempted to make Tim kill Batman, Tim turned on the Joker and killed him before suffering a [[mental breakdown]]; Harley Quinn is also believed to have perished after falling from a mineshaft during her fight with [[Batgirl]] (Barbara). Batman and Batgirl comforted Tim and then buried the Joker's body in the mineshaft deep beneath [[Arkham Asylum]], while Tim was eventually rehabilitated by Dr. [[Leslie Thompkins]], Bruce forbade Tim from resuming his vigilante role, blaming himself for what happened and swore that he would never endanger another young partner again before Tim soon left, choosing to make the right decision for himself.  Terry decides to question Tim, who denies any involvement with the Joker and bitterly claims he had grown sick of his past life as Robin. Terry then suspects Wayne Enterprises' operations manager Jordan Pryce, who would have taken control of [[Wayne Enterprises]] were it not for Bruce's return. Terry finds the Jokerz with Pryce on the company's [[yacht]], who reveal that Pryce had hired them and given them access codes. However, the Joker has sent them to kill Pryce, as he is no longer needed and to cover their tracks. Terry rescues Pryce before a laser blast destroys the yacht, and turns him over to the police.  Back in the Batcave, Terry deduces that Tim must be working with the Joker when he discovers that the high-tech equipment the Jokerz have been stealing could be combined by someone with Tim's expertise as a top-level communications expert to form a machine that would be able to take control of any [[satellite]], even an orbiting military satellite with an automated defense system, and fire it at will, thus explaining what happened on the yacht.  Terry tracks the Joker to the abandoned Jolly Jack Candy Factory where he instead finds Tim, who then transforms into the Joker before his eyes. The Joker reveals that when he kidnapped Robin, he secretly implanted a [[Microchip implant (human)|microchip]] built from cutting-edge genetics technology (revealed [[Batman Beyond#Series finale|later]] to have been stolen from [[Project Cadmus#Television|Project Cadmus]]), into Tim's brain. The microchip carries the Joker's consciousness and genetics, allowing the Joker to transform Tim into a [[cloning|clone]] of himself, eventually becoming strong enough to permanently control Tim's body.  Terry discovers the Joker to be a formidable combatant since he has extensive knowledge of Bruce's tactics. Terry improvises by using his own [[street fighting]] maneuvers and taunting the Joker's obsession with Bruce as well as his origin, sending the Joker into a fury to put him off balance. Retrieving the Joker's [[joy buzzer]]&mdash;which had minutes earlier fallen against several control wires, shocking them and causing the active laser to redirect itself towards the candy factory&mdash;Terry delivers a shock to the Joker's neck, destroying the microchip and reverting Tim to his old self, finally freeing him from the Joker's control and ending him permanently. Terry escapes with Tim before the satellite destroys the factory and the satellite-jamming device, safely shutting itself down.  As Tim recovers in the hospital, he is visited by Bruce, and they both express gratitude towards Terry for saving Tim's life and acknowledge his worth to the Batman mantle as Bruce and Tim reconcile. Harley is also revealed to have survived her fall decades earlier when an elderly Harley is seen bailing her grandchildren (Dee Dee) out of prison.  
Beautiful (2000 film)
 Mona Hibbard (Driver) is a young woman from a troubled home who has one overarching goal: to become the winner of the Miss America pageant. Her mother is an alcoholic who graduates from berating her young daughter for not doing well in kids' pageants to declaring she will not provide any money or support for Mona if she keeps competing. Fortunately for Mona, she becomes best friends with Ruby Stilwell (Adams) and Ruby's kind grandmother (Herta Ware) joins her sweet granddaughter to support Mona as she begins her steady rise through the beauty pageant ranks.   Mona becomes pregnant, but, as women with children are ineligible for the MAM crown, Ruby selflessly agrees to raise Mona's daughter Vanessa ([[Hallie Kate Eisenberg]]) as her own daughter. Mona becomes colder and meaner as she gets closer to achieving her goal, whether she's sabotaging fellow contestant Joyce Perkins ([[Leslie Stefanson]]) on her routine and earning a lifelong enemy of an aspiring newscaster, or pawning all of her inconveniences onto Ruby while ignoring how obvious it is that Vanessa looks exactly like her – a path that leads to her victory in the Miss Illinois pageant. When Mona goes to tell her mom about it, she fends off the mom's gross, leering husband and is left hurt when she'd told that it would take too much effort to attend the MAM pageant, at which point Vanessa defends Mona and Mona is bitterly relieved to be ejected from the unloving home she grew up in.  When Ruby is falsely accused of [[euthanasia]] and jailed, Mona is forced to care for Vanessa, a task at which she is neither qualified nor appreciative, as she is afraid that her MAM crown bid will be taken away. Vanessa reacts to the situation by being angry and difficult to handle, making it clear she knows Mona is her mother and leaving Mona sad and angry with herself for not being able to just be honest. Mona heads to the MAM showcase, where one of the other contestants is nice to her and another cattily asks Mona for extra tickets for her large and loving family (Mona smiles and says "No"), while Joyce has the lead on breaking the story about Vanessa's parentage. She only later matures after seeking guidance from jailed Ruby, when Ruby refuses to fill her usual supportive role and bluntly tell Mona she needs to take care of her responsibilities in general and her daughter most of all. Mona comes to see that the pursuit of pageant fame is empty next to taking care of her family, and when she makes the MAM Final 3 she announces that she will be a role model to one little girl instead of a hero to countless strangers, confirming that she is Vanessa's mom and is withdrawing from the pageant.

The Beach (film)
 Richard, a young American seeking adventure in [[Bangkok]], travels in a drab travelers hotel in Khao San Road where he meets a young French couple, Françoise and Étienne, and he immediately becomes attracted to Françoise. He also meets the eccentric Daffy, who tells him of a pristine, uninhabited and restricted island in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] with a beautiful hidden beach and lagoon. Daffy explains that he and other travelers settled there in secret several years earlier, but difficulties arose and he chose to leave. Daffy commits suicide, leaving Richard a map to the island. Richard convinces Françoise and Étienne to accompany him to the island, and the three travel to [[Ko Samui]]. After getting locked out of his bungalow during a thunderstorm, Richard meets two American surfers who have heard rumors of the island, including huge amounts of [[cannabis]] supposedly growing there. Before departing, Richard leaves them a copy of the map.  En route to the island, Richard becomes infatuated with Françoise. After swimming to the island from a neighboring one, they find a large cannabis plantation guarded by armed Thai farmers. Avoiding detection, they make their way across the island and meet English cricket fan Keatey where they are welcomed and surprised to see a fully functioning community of travelers living on the island, totally in secret. Sal, the community's English leader, explains that the farmers allow them to stay so long as they keep to themselves and do not allow any more travelers to come to the island but more travelers came over the years, evading the farmers and settling there. Richard lies that they have not shown the map to anyone else, which satisfies Sal. The trio become integrated into the largely self-sufficient and leisurely community.   One night, while the community are occupied, Françoise invites Richard to the beach where the relationship becomes romantic and they have sex. Despite hoping to keep it secret, everyone finds out and while angry, Étienne says he will not stand in their way if Françoise is happier with Richard. Tensions rise between Richard and Sal's South African boyfriend Bugs; when Richard gains popularity by killing a shark, Bugs mocks him over the shark's small size but Richard mocks him back for his jealousy.  When Sal selects Richard to accompany her on a supply run to [[Ko Pha Ngan]], Bugs warns him to keep his hands off her. While there they encounter the American surfers Richard met in Ko Samui, who are preparing to search for the island and mention Richard's map. Richard lies to Sal that he did not give them a copy, and she coaxes him into having sex with her in exchange for keeping her secrecy about the incident. On their return to the island, Richard lies to Françoise about having had sex with Sal and continues his relationship with her. Things return to normal until a shark attack kills one of the community's fishermen and leaves another, Christo, severely injured. Sal refuses to compromise the community's secrecy by bringing medical help, and Christo is unable to travel to the mainland. His worsening condition affects the group's morale, so they isolate him in a tent despite Étienne's objections.  When the surfers from Ko Pha Ngan turn up on the neighboring island, Sal sees that they have a map, confronts Richard for lying about it, and orders him to camp alone to observe them until they cross over, then intercept them, send them away and destroy it. She also tells everyone that she and Richard had sex, which leaves Françoise angry and heartbroken. Isolated from the group, Richard begins to lose his sanity, stalking the cannabis farmers, stealing some of their personal items while they sleep, and imagining that he is conversing with the deceased Daffy. The surfers reach the island but are discovered and killed by the farmers. Shocked at witnessing their deaths, Richard tries to gather Françoise and Étienne to leave the island. Étienne refuses to leave Christo, whose leg has become [[gangrene|gangrenous]], so Richard euthanizes Christo by suffocation.  The series of events propagated by Richard come to a head. He is captured by the farmers, who know that he has been stalking them, and brought before the community. Françoise and Étienne are also captured trying to escape and returned to the community. The farmers have also found the map that Richard had given the (now dead) surfers and become furious with the community for breaking their deal to not allow any more newcomers. Richard's part in the sexual betrayals of Françoise, Étienne and Bugs has already frayed the community's cohesion. The lead farmer gives Sal a gun loaded with a single bullet and orders her to make a choice: kill Richard and the group will be allowed to stay, or else they must all leave immediately. Sal pulls the trigger, but the chamber is empty. Shocked by her willingness to commit murder, the community abandons Sal, leaving the island and going their separate ways.  Later, back in America, Richard receives an email at an Internet cafe from Françoise with a group photograph of the beach community in happier times.

Battlefield Earth (film)
 In the year 3000, Earth is a desolate wasteland. The Psychlos, a brutal race of giant humanoid aliens, have ruled the planet for a thousand years, and use human slave labor to strip its minerals and other resources.  A few primitive [[hunter-gatherer]] tribes of humans live in freedom in remote, hidden areas, but after ten centuries of Psychlo oppression they have abandoned any hope of regaining control of their planet.  Jonnie Goodboy Tyler ([[Barry Pepper]]) rejects this universal hopelessness and leaves his tribe in the [[Rocky Mountains]] on a journey of exploration with a nomad hunter named Carlo ([[Kim Coates]]).  Both are captured by a Psychlo raiding party and transported to a slave camp in the ruins of [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]], the Psychlos' principal base of operations.  A massive dome over the base protects the Psychlos from Earth's atmosphere, which is toxic to them.  At the camp, they meet Terl ([[John Travolta]]), the Psychlo security chief, and his deputy, Ker ([[Forest Whitaker]]).  Terl is stranded permanently at his remote Earth outpost due to an unexplained incident involving "the Senator's daughter".  He plans to bribe his way back to the Psychlo home planet by illegally mining gold in areas of high radioactivity.  Psychlos avoid such areas because radiation reacts explosively with the gas mixture that they breathe. Terl selects Jonnie to lead the mining operation.  Jonnie acquires a comprehensive knowledge of human history and literature in a Psychlo rapid-learning machine. He defiantly declares that one day, humans will overthrow the Psychlos and retake their planet.  An amused Terl shows Jonnie the ruins of Denver and its public library and boasts that the Psychlos conquered all of Earth in only nine minutes during the [[21st century]]. Jonnie spends time in the library  and is particularly inspired by the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Terl gives Jonnie a party of slaves and a Psychlo flying shuttle and orders him to find gold.  Jonnie locates a plentiful supply at the long-abandoned [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]].  He also discovers an abandoned underground military base with working [[AV-8 Harrier II|Harrier]] jump-jets, weapons, and fuel.  While they are supposed to be laboring in the mines, Jonnie and his followers plot a revolution, and use the military base's flight simulators to train themselves in aerial combat.  After a week of training, the rebels launch their attack.  In a suicide mission, Carlo flies his Psychlo flying shuttle into the Denver dome, destroying it and suffocating the Psychlos inside.  Jonnie captures a [[Teleportation in fiction|teleportation]] device and uses it to teleport a [[dirty bomb]] to the Psychlo home world. When it detonates, the radiation it releases reacts catastrophically with the Psychlo atmosphere, destroying all life on the planet. The humans have retaken Earth, but face an uncertain future.  The sole Psychlo survivors are Terl, who is imprisoned inside Fort Knox in a makeshift cell of gold bars; and Ker, who joins the victorious humans in their challenging project to rebuild their civilization.<ref name="sightsound" />

Bawandar
  ''Bawandar'' is based on the true story of [[Bhanwari Devi]]'s gang-rape case. The names of characters and places have been changed for legal reasons. For example, Bhanwari's character is called Sanwari, her husband Mohan's character is called Sohan, and their village is called Dhabri (Bhateri in real life).  The story is introduced through first-person narration by a foreign reporter called Amy ([[Laila Rouass]]), who has read about Sanwari's case in a newspaper. Amy and her friend-cum-interpreter Ravi ([[Rahul Khanna]]) visit Sanwari's village to investigate the matter, five years after the gang-rape incident. Upon their arrival in Rajasthan, Amy and Ravi meet a rickshaw-puller named Sohan ([[Raghuvir Yadav]]) by happenstance, who helps them on their way to a village where they encounter Sanwari's rapists. Sohan turns out to be Sanwari's husband, and tells the tale of Sanwari's rape case.  Sohan and Sanwari are a married couple belonging to a low-[[Indian caste system|caste]] [[Kumhar]] (potter) community. The couple live with Sohan's parents and have a two children, a young girl and a boy. Sanwari makes pots whilst Sohan plies the rickshaw for their subsistence. While working at a local quarry, Sanwari stands up for her rights to the corrupt supervisor. The news of her bravery reaches Shobha Devi ([[Deepti Naval]]), a social worker who works for the Government of India. Her job involves creating awareness amongst the illiterate villagers against social evils like child marriage, oppression of women etc. In Dhabri, she recruits Sanwari ([[Nandita Das]]) as a ''Saathin'', a grassroots worker employed as part of the Women's Development Project run by the Government of Rajasthan.  As part of her job, Sanwari educates the womenfolk in the village against child marriages and oppression against women, and invites ire of the conservative village elders. Most of these villagers belong to the [[Gurjar]] community, a higher caste. To subjugate Sanwari, five members of the Gurjar community order a social and economic boycott of Sanwari and her family. The villagers stop selling milk to her family or buying the earthen pots they make. When Sanwari informs the police about a child marriage happening in the Gurjar community, five men from the Gurjar household where the marriage was supposed to happen decide to teach Sanwari a lesson. Having had enough of her shenanigans and what they perceive as her affront to their male ego, they collectively beat up her husband and two of them take turns in gang-raping her.  Despite the horrific nature of the incident and the stigma attached to it, Sanwari and Sohan muster up courage and go to the police station to lodged a [[First Information Report]], but the corrupt inspector ([[Ravi Jhankal]]) refuses to lodge the FIR in absence of a medical report. The doctor refuses to issue a medical report in the absence of a court order, explaining that he cannot do so because it's a rape case. With Shobha's help, the couple finally manages to get a court order. With the court order, they get a medical test done in [[Jaipur]], and a complaint is lodged two days after the incident.  However, the rapists are not arrested and roam around freely, boasting about their lustful experience with Sanwari. Sanwari's case gets nationwide attention after the head of a women's NGO in Delhi gets involved and tries to help Sanwari. The [[Prime Minister of India]] himself entrusts the investigation to the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] and offers Rs. 1 [[lakh]] as support to Sanwari from the Prime Minister's Relief Fund.  The accused are arrested and tried in the court, but they are backed by the local [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]] Dhanraj Meena ([[Govind Namdeo]]). Meena hires a lawyer called Purohit to defend the accused. A Gurjar lawyer ([[Gulshan Grover]]) defends Saanwari, but faces pressure from his community to favor the accuse. The judges handling the case are transferred multiple times, and the final judgement goes against her, with all 5 of the accused walking away scot free.  The movie ends with actress Deepti Naval talking about how Bhanwari Devi has refuses to give up her fight for justice, in spite of unhelpful villagers and relatives, an incompetent police force, and a corrupt judicial system, and is today active as a rape activist who helps provide help, counseling and inspiration to women who have suffered such injustices as well.  
Best in Show (film)
 ''Best in Show'' is presented as a [[Documentary film|documentary]] of five dogs and their owners destined to show in the Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show, held in [[Philadelphia]]. Segments of the documentary continuously cycle among owners and handlers as each prepares to leave for the show, arrives at the hotel, prepares backstage, handles their dog's performance, and appears in a post-show follow-up. The owners and their dogs include: * '''Gerry and Cookie Fleck''' ([[Eugene Levy]], [[Catherine O'Hara]]), '''with their [[Norwich Terrier]] Winky''' - :A middle-class couple from [[Florida]], who run into monetary problems and are forced to sleep in the hotel's storage room when they finally arrive. Throughout the film, they encounter men Cookie has slept with during her youth. * '''Meg and Hamilton Swan''' ([[Parker Posey]], [[Michael Hitchcock]]), '''with their [[Weimaraner]] Beatrice''' - :An upper-class, stereotypical yuppie couple from [[Chicago]], they think they are taking great care of Beatrice (although really they are just confusing and upsetting her with their neurotic behavior), going as far as taking her to a therapist after she sees Meg and Hamilton have sex. At the show, the Swans believe that Beatrice will become unnerved without her favorite toy, the "Busy Bee", and frantically search for a replacement for it before the show. * '''Harlan Pepper''' ([[Christopher Guest]]) '''and his [[Bloodhound]] Hubert''' - :The owner of a fishing goods store and an aspiring ventriloquist. An affable man who prides himself on being able to name nuts,  Pepper's family has raised a variety of hounds for generations, and Harlan continues the tradition by raising bloodhounds. * '''Sherri Ann and Leslie Ward Cabot''' ([[Jennifer Coolidge]], [[Patrick Cranshaw]]) '''with their [[Standard Poodle]] Rhapsody in White (a.k.a. Butch)''' - :A two-time past winner of the show. Sherri Ann is a [[trophy wife]] to the elderly Leslie, her [[age disparity in sexual relationships|sugar daddy]]. They are assisted by trainer Christy Cummings ([[Jane Lynch]]) who makes sure the dog is truly ready for the show, while Sherri Ann fixates on giving Christy a [[makeover]] and Leslie remains utterly oblivious. Over the course of the film, Sherri Ann and Leslie's sham marriage and Sherri Ann and Christy's romantic involvement becomes apparent. * '''Scott Donlan and Stefan Vanderhoof''' ([[John Michael Higgins]], [[Michael McKean]]) '''and their [[Shih Tzu]] Miss Agnes''' - :A [[camp (style)|campy]] [[gay]] couple, they take great pride in their dog, and are confident that she will win the competition.  They have a love of old movies, and enjoy making fun of Christy Cummings, but are friendly to the other competitors, especially the Flecks.  The owners and their dogs all arrive in time for the show, which is hosted by dog expert Trevor Beckwith ([[Jim Piddock]]), and oblivious "color" commentator Buck Laughlin ([[Fred Willard]]). During the first round, Beatrice is disqualified when Hamilton cannot control her, but the other four dogs advance to the final round. Just before the finals, Cookie dislocates her knee and insists that Gerry take over for her. Though the audience is initially awed by seeing Gerry's "two left feet" (the result of a birth defect), ultimately Winky takes Best in Show.  Afterwards, the film explores what each character is doing after the competition. Gerry and Cookie return home to Florida and are overcome with attention after the victory. They go on to record, in amusingly bad style, songs about terriers but discover to Gerry's frustration that the recording engineer is yet another of Cookie's ex-boyfriends ([[Steven Porter]]). Sherri Ann and Christy have entered into a partnership (It is unknown whether Leslie has died or has been divorced from Sherri Ann.) and publish a magazine for lesbian owners of purebred dogs, called ''American Bitch''. Harlan fulfills his dreams and becomes a ventriloquist, entertaining sparse crowds with a [[honky tonk]] song and dance number. Stefan and Scott are in the process of designing a calendar featuring Shih Tzu dogs appearing in scenes, with appropriate costume, from famous classic films, such as ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (and ''[[McMillan & Wife]]'', a television show included without explanation.) Hamilton and Meg Swan have given Beatrice away, allowing them to enjoy a calmer, more loving partnership as well as a new dog (a [[pug]]) named Kipper who they claim enjoys watching them make love.

They live happily together until Durga Devi discovers that they have been deceiving her, and she lashes out at Dashrath and Bharat. Durga Devi fires her maid and makes the new bride, Priya do all the household chores.  As time passes, Priya falls pregnant and is foretold that her child will bring great happiness in the family by Durga Devi's father. Everyone assumes that this means Priya is carrying a son as a daughter could not possibly bring happiness to the family. Durga Devi's behaviour suddenly changes towards Priya and Priya is treated like a princess as she is carrying the requisite heir. However, on a visit to the doctor, Bharat and Priya are informed that they are having a girl and not a son. They soon realise that if Durga Devi ever finds out that they are having a girl then she will once again treat Priya poorly so they decide to play along with the story that she is having a boy. At the time of Priya's delivery, Bharat's friend Mulayamchand's wife is also having a baby. Both wives go into labour together with Priya delivering a girl and Mullu's wife delivering a boy. Durga Devi suddenly collapses and ends up in the same hospital. Bharat's Father sees Bharat holding Mullu's son in his arms, mistakes him for his grandson and runs with the child to revive the ailing Durga Devi. Three days later, Durga Devi insists on taking her son home. Bharat persuades Mullu and his wife to live closer to their home and convinces Mullu and his wife to let them keep their son during the day and would be returned to them during the night and in turn they could keep their daughter during the day and would be taken back at night.  The story goes on and on with the two mothers running from house to house trying to soothe their own respective child until one day they are caught by Durga Devi where she comes to the cliched realisation that she made a mistake in wanting a son and accepts her granddaughters.

Unknown to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet. But, passionate about dancing, Billy secretly continues lessons with the help of his dance teacher, Sandra Wilkinson.  Mrs. Wilkinson believes Billy is talented enough to study at the [[Royal Ballet School]] in London, but due to Tony's arrest during a skirmish between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition.

Big Brother Trouble
 Sibling rivalry reaches new heights when two brothers fall for the same girl in this family comedy. Mitch Dobson ([[Michal Suchánek]]) is a 11-year-old soccer fan who doesn't get along very well with his 16-year-old brother, Sean ([[Shad Hart]]). When Police Captain Stacy ([[Dick Van Patten]]) and his family moves in next door, Mitch immediately falls for his 16-year-old daughter, Gwen ([[Lindsey Brooke]]). Gwen, however, is a lot more interested in Sean, and when Sean and Gwen start dating, Mitch and his friends begin scheming to find a way to put an end to their budding romance.  Mitch Dobson and his two friends Josh and Peter are playing soccer in his front yard while Mitch's big brother Sean is also playing at a soccer game with his high school team. While playing, Mitch accidentally kicks the ball too hard, causing it to break a lamp sitting with the moving boxes next door. Mitch is reprimanded by the old man (Police Captain Stacey) who owns the lamp, telling Mitch he owes him two hundred, but Sean comes to the rescue, offering to pay for it. Captain Stacey is happy that Sean is taking the matter responsibly into his own hands and tells Mitch he wishes he were more like his big brother, but Mitch is too busy staring at the Captain's beautiful daughter Gwen.  While swimming with Josh and Peter later, Mitch hears a scream from next door and finds Gwen swimming. He fantasizes about being with her, but suddenly Captain Stacey catches the boys snooping and chases them off. Gwen finds them after he's left, and Mitch offers to give her a tour of his house later. But Sean arrives suddenly, offering to have Gwen over for lunch, and she obviously seems more comfortable with Sean's offer than Mitch's. Mitch, furious, schemes to keep Sean out of the way. He lures and traps Sean in the barn out back just before Gwen arrives, and he lets her into the house while Sean is pounding and yelling for him in the backyard. Gwen hears him and rescues him, but the lunch Sean is cooking for Gwen burns in the oven. Gwen is flattered that he made her a meal, and he offers to take her out for pizza to make up for the chicken Mitch ruined. As they head down a back road toward town, Mitch and his friends tail them, but the sounds from their walkie-talkies terrifies Mitch and Josh, who run screaming out of the trees, revealing themselves to Gwen and Sean.  Mitch asks his father for advice on girls, and Robert tells him that every girl is different, although most of them appreciate romance, such as being taken out on dates. He praises Sean on how he is treating Gwen, and tells Mitch that when Sean finally raises enough money to buy the Mustang he's been watching, he'll be able to take Gwen out more often. Mitch realizes Sean's looking for a job to raise the last of that money he needs, plus the two hundred for Captain Stacey's lamp. To keep him from getting the money, Mitch jeopardizes Sean's opportunities by calling various locations around town with a disguised voice, saying different terrible things about him to keep employers from hiring him. However, Mitch slips up, and Sean ends up successfully landing a job at Oddo's Donut Shop.  Sean finds Gwen at the coffee house where she works, telling her the good news that he has a job and will be getting his car soon. Gwen becomes excited, and as her shift ends, she sings a song for Sean, which she is well known for at her workplace. Mitch happens upon the shop while she is singing and becomes entranced, but is spotted embarrassingly and leaves. Over the next few days he tries different ways to show Gwen he's a great guy and gain her interest, but nothing works.  During his next soccer practice, Sean asks his coach if he can leave a bit early each day for work, which the coach reluctantly agrees to. Mitch catches Gwen leaving after Sean has taken off for his job, and Gwen finally manages to let Mitch down gently about her relationship with his brother. Upset and misunderstanding, Mitch tells her he hates her and runs away.  The soccer coach shows up at Oddo's Donut Shop that evening, and asks Oddo if he could allow Sean to come in late to work, so he won't have to leave practice early anymore. He stresses how important it is that Sean help the team win the next two games, because he is the team's best player, and the school's budget cuts will remove the soccer team if they don't win the championship by beating the Eastern and the Tigers. Sean's boss Oddo grudgingly agrees, but he knows he will lose money if Sean cannot come in early enough to make deliveries. To compensate, he and his two gambling buddies form a point-shaving scheme in which Sean will win the game by less than three points. Oddo plans to bet high numbers on this exact eventuality to earn big. He asks Sean to win the game this way, but he speaks vaguely to keep Sean from realizing it's an illegal gambling scheme. To lure Sean in, he gives Sean the two hundred to pay for Captain Stacey's lamp, and promises Sean the final thousand he needs for the Mustang if he wins the game according to Oddo's instructions. Sean's intuition warns him, and he is visibly uncomfortable, but ends up accepting, as he decides that Oddo seems to know more about money than he does.  When he tells Gwen later, she becomes nervous and tells him not to participate in the scheme. Sean argues that it can't be illegal, and the two get into a fight, leading to Sean storming out. One of Oddo's buddies, secretly hanging out at the coffee house and having heard the entire conversation, warns Oddo that Sean's girlfriend may be going to the police, and Oddo orders both his men to kidnap her until after Sean's game. But Sean has been considering Gwen's words, and he makes up his mind to not be a part of Oddo's scheme. When he tells Oddo, Oddo becomes angry and shows Sean Gwen, who is tied and taped in the back of the delivery truck. Sean, frightened, backs down and agrees to win the game the way Oddo specified to keep him from hurting Gwen. Oddo considers, but decides it's too risky to continue with his plan. He calls his competitor and changes the terms of the bet to Sean's team losing, then throws Sean into the truck with Gwen.  Josh and Peter, having been close by, see this happen, and they run to tell Mitch. The three of them get to the shop, but Oddo's men are guarding the truck. Josh and Peter lure them away, and Mitch climbs into the back of the truck to save Sean and Gwen, but their ropes are too tight. When Josh and Peter run back, they try to help, but to no avail. Oddo drives off with all the kids in the back. They start banging at the walls, causing Oddo to stop and investigate. Mitch, Josh and Peter sneak out of the back as Oddo reaches the delivery door, and they jump into the front of the truck and take off with Oddo running after them. The boys head for the park, driving erratically, but are blocked off by Oddo's two buddies again on a detour. Josh sprays one of them with his inhaler, startling them, and pushes them away from the open window, letting them escape again.  As they reach the park, Sean and Gwen, having finished untying the ropes Mitch and his friends loosened, break free from the truck. Sean immediately rushes to the field to finish the game his team is losing, and he scores them to victory. Oddo arrives at the field with his buddies, just in time to see that he has lost the bet. Gwen sees them and tells her father, and the enraged captain sends everyone on the field after the kidnappers, who are quickly caught.  Sean and Gwen thank the boys, and Mitch apologizes to Gwen for his outburst. Gwen introduces Mitch, Josh and Peter to her young cousin Candace and her two friends, who take an interest in the boys and walk off with them. Mitch is obvious infatuated with Candace, forgetting his feelings for Gwen, and the film ends with the two kids walking off the field together.

By then he was very disturbed, traumatized by the early death of his father and the disappearance of his mother. But he appeared bright and sweetly loving to his grandmother.  The film focuses on the continuous battle against age discrimination faced by Dees and many like her. While contending with her own declining health, and a bureaucratic and legal system that continually threatened to separate her from her grandson, Dees fights the misconception that age supersedes one's ability to love and care for a child.

He burned a magazine in his bedroom, which resulted in a house fire, destroying their home. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where the doctors determined that Dees was no longer able to handle her grandson. They would not release him to her until she agreed to place him in long-term residential care. After a challenging search, Walter is accepted at an appropriate facility and thrives during his year there. However, when treatment was completed, social workers determined that Dees was too frail to care for him, and Walter was placed again in a foster home. Walter's aunts and uncles were unable to take him in, possibly because they felt unqualified to deal with his often threatening and troubled behavior.

Big Momma's House
 The story begins in an illegal underground dog-fighting arena in [[Korea]], where an undercover [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent, John Patterson, has been identified and is later ordered by a Korean mob boss to be killed. However, John is eventually rescued by his undercover partner and master of disguise, Malcolm Turner.  Meanwhile, a criminal named Lester Vesco, who was originally serving a life sentence in prison for murder and armed robbery, escapes from his cell by killing a doctor and stealing his car. The FBI assigns Malcolm and John to capture Lester by sending them to small-town [[Cartersville, Georgia]] to stake out the house of an overweight, elderly [[African American]] woman named Hattie Mae Pierce (who is suffering from stewed prunes), whom her friends call her Big Momma. Big Momma is the estranged [[Southern United States|Southern]] grandmother of Lester's ex-girlfriend, Sherry Pierce, a bank employee who supposedly aided Lester in his robbery by giving him the key to the vault. After Big Momma unexpectedly leaves town for two weeks to help an ill friend, Malcolm and John sneak into her house to plant security cameras and tap the phones. Sherry calls Big Momma's house, and Malcolm disguises his voice as Big Momma in order to lure Sherry to the house and possibly obtain a confession. The plan works, and Malcolm and John work together on a Big Momma disguise costume before Sherry's arrival.  The next day, Sherry arrives at Big Momma's house with her 10-year-old son, Trent. However, Malcolm's behaviour and sudden inexperience with cooking confuses Sherry. Malcolm also has to deal with Big Momma's lecherous boyfriend, Ben Rawley; act as midwife for a woman named Ritha, who has gone into labor; and attend self-defense classes under Ritha's older brother, a dim-witted security guard named Nolan, whom Malcolm handily defeats. After Malcolm almost damages the suit while sleeping, he tries to sneak back to the [[safe house]] where he and John are staying. However, Sherry captures Malcolm on the porch and he poses as Big Momma's [[handyman]]. Malcolm and John repair the suit. When Malcolm leaves with Sherry, John searches Trent and Sherry's belongings for clues, but to no avail. Malcolm bonds with Trent when he defends him against the two older boys who bullied Trent and kicked him off a basketball court so they could play. Malcolm and Trent eventually beat the boys at basketball, amazing Nolan and Trent. Malcolm also begins to bond with Sherry and Trent when he accompanies them on a fishing trip as himself. That night, Nolan discovers Malcolm and John's undercover operation and is reluctantly recruited to help them after he insists.  Malcolm accompanies Sherry and Trent to church, where the Reverend calls on Malcolm to give his testimony. Malcolm attempts to influence Sherry and Trent by giving them his testimony about the importance of not keeping secrets. When Malcolm, Sherry, and Trent return to Big Momma's house, they discover a surprise birthday party for Big Momma. During the party, the real Big Momma returns home prematurely, whom John tries to stall her. Malcolm accidentally finds the stolen money hidden in Trent's footlocker. Sherry tells Malcolm the real story: Lester had wooed Sherry so he could steal her keys to gain access to the bank vault; Sherry did not tell anyone about her stolen keys out of fear of getting fired. John quietly tells Nolan that the real Big Momma is back, at which point Nolan accidentally locks Malcolm out of the house, believing he is the real Big Momma. When Lester arrives after tracking down Sherry, Malcolm breaks through the window and fights Lester, causing confusion among the partygoers as they see two Big Mommas at once. Lester shoots John in his right shoulder and rips Malcolm's mask during a fistfight, which reveals his identity. Nonetheless, Malcolm subdues Lester by knocking him out through the window. Sherry and Trent are heartbroken to realize that Malcolm was an FBI agent all along, and they refuse to speak to him. The police arrest Lester and paramedics take John to the hospital to heal his right shoulder.  On Sunday morning, Malcolm goes to church to testify Sherry, Trent, and Big Momma. Malcolm delivers his confession and heartfelt speech to Sherry and Trent, and later admits that he genuinely loves them. Big Momma forgives Malcolm, and the crowd cheers as Malcolm and Sherry kiss.

Bless the Child
  Maggie O'Connor's ([[Kim Basinger]]) life revolves around her job as a nurse at a busy New York hospital. Her sister Jenna, a hardcore drug user ([[Angela Bettis]]), abandons her newborn daughter Cody at Maggie's home. Maggie takes Cody in, and she becomes the daughter she never had. Cody is diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum, and is enrolled in a Catholic school for children with special needs in order to make her more aware of her surroundings (part of her condition). The nuns who run the school are struggling to keep Cody out of danger and keep her occupied. Cody begins to show special telekinetic abilities, such as being able to spin toys. She also resurrects a bird after it flies into a school window and breaks its neck.  Meanwhile, children with the same birth date and age as Cody begin to be abducted and killed around the city. Members of a mysterious cult, with a black symbol tattooed on their arms, are shown to be tracking and abducting these children. They are apparently trying to find a child with certain unspecified abilities. If they do not exhibit such abilities, the cult murders and discards them.  One night, Maggie is at work at her local hospital where she meets a young woman called Cheri Post ([[ Christina Ricci]]) who was formerly part of the same cult. Cheri is a drug user who is afraid to show Maggie her arms which are covered in track marks and tattoos, one being the same satanic symbol of the cult. She recognizes Maggie's surname and comments on her similarity with Jenna. Maggie begs Cheri to tell her where Jenna is living, as neither she nor Cody has seen her since Jenna left. Rather than disclosing Jenna's location, Cheri warns Maggie to protect Cody as the cult is looking for her. Cheri is hospitalized after cult members attempt to murder her.  Jenna suddenly re-appears with a mysterious new husband, Eric ([[Rufus Sewell]]), and abducts Cody ([[Holliston Coleman]]). Despite the fact that Maggie has no legal rights to Cody, [[FBI]] agent John Travis ([[Jimmy Smits]]), an expert in [[ritual murder]] and [[occult]]-related crime, takes up her case when he realizes that Cody shares the same birth date as several other recently missing children.  Cody, it soon becomes clear, is more than simply special. She manifests extraordinary powers that the forces of evil have waited centuries to control, and her abduction sparks a clash between the soldiers of good and evil that can only be resolved, in the end, by the strength of one small child and the love she inspires in those she touches.  
Biohazard 4D-Executer
 The film is set in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern American]] Raccoon City, whose citizens have been transformed into zombies after becoming infected with the T-virus, a biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company [[List of Resident Evil characters#Umbrella Corporation|Umbrella]]. A military squad – consisting of leader Claus (Masaki Aizawa) and his men Roger ([[Hiroto Torihata]]), Ed (Hideto Ebihara), Robert (Tadasuke Omizu) and Norman (Yoshiyuki Kaneko) – is sent into the city by the company. Members of the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service, a group specialized in containing biohazard outbreaks caused by Umbrella,<ref></ref> their objective is to rescue Dr. Cameron ([[Yurika Hino]]), a female scientist researching a new virus.  The squad tracks a signal from her ID card, and is drawn to a warehouse, where Robert is killed during a surprise attack from an unidentified monster. The team blows the creature to pieces, but is unaware of its ability to transfer its mind to other life forms. The squad leaves to chase Dr. Cameron's now-moving signal to a manhole, and the monster follows them in the body of a crow. Norman and Roger accompany Claus into the sewers, while Ed stands guard on the street. Underground, the team finds Dr. Cameron's equipment, and is attacked by a dog. After shooting the dog, they see the doctor's ID card attached to it. Roger, who is a higher-up within Umbrella, reveals to the others that the true purpose of their mission was not to rescue Dr. Cameron, but to collect her research data regarding a new virus capable of regenerating genes. She was infected with her creation, and mutated into the monster that the squad had fought at the warehouse.  While Claus, Norman and Roger return to the surface, Ed is killed by the crow, and transforms into a creature similar to the one in the warehouse. This new monster kills Norman, but Claus and Roger can barely escape in a humvee, using a machine gun attached to the vehicle to destroy it. As the two men drive out of the city, Claus asks about the virus. Roger explains how it fuses with genes, enabling Dr. Cameron to regenerate her body in other life forms, and thus making her nearly immortal. Roger then impales Claus with tentacles, pinning him to the seat. At this point, Roger is revealed to have two faces, the second one being Dr. Cameron's. The researcher explains that she was watching them in the body of the dog while they were in the warehouse, and that she realized that Umbrella was pursuing her research data. Dr. Cameron tells Claus that he and his team turned out to be perfect guinea pigs for the virus she had created, and that she will continue her experiments, trying to return herself to a human form. Using tentacles, she rips Claus' face apart.

One person is "It" and the rest of the group try to find "It" and whoever finds "It" must scream Bloody Murder and then everyone must run back to base before "It" can tag them. Everyone joins in, with Jason being it, and Jason and Dean play a prank on one of the counselors Brad (Dave Smigelski). After the game, Dean witnesses Jason making out with Whitney.

The following night, the counselors gather in the mess hall for a movie, and Whitney goes to grab some food from the kitchen and is stabbed to death by a man in a hockey mask. The next day, the counselors inform Patrick that Jason and Whitney have gone missing, and they call the local sheriff who interrogates the group. Everyone suspects Dean, because he is Whitney's ex-boyfriend and he has been acting suspiciously. Dean cannot provide an alibi, so he is taken in for questioning. Julie encounters Henry again who tells her about her dad and a name of Nelson. She emails her dad about it. Brad is killed next by the masked murderer and he goes missing, and Dean is released.   Julie gets an email reply from her dad, and he claims he doesn't remember a man named Nelson. Jason is suspected next, considering he had a past with Brad.

That night, Julie is attacked again by a man who chases her to the mess hall, where she locks him in the freezer. Her attacker is revealed to be Jason, who fled the area because he was worried that Dean would tell about him cheating on Julie with Whitney, and also because he was worried the police were after him. Jason is taken in by the police.   The killer murders Doug. Julie's father arrives after hearing about the police, and Drew and Julie's father walk to the lake, as Julie retreats to her cabin to gather some things. There, she deduces the killer is Drew when she sees that Drew's father was Bill Anderson, the man that Nelson Hammond killed for revenge. She confronts Drew, but is quickly proven wrong when the killer appears and attacks them. Drew is knocked out and Julie flees. Julie runs into Patrick, and then Patrick reveals he is the killer. He is really Nelson Hammond and is seeking revenge for his accident that the other counselors caused. He attacks Julie with an axe, and chases her through the woods. She runs to the camp, and the other counselors, the police, Patrick and Julie gather. Patrick tries to make it seem like Julie hit her head and is delusional. Tobe believes Julie, and threatens to shoot Patrick, but finds out he has no bullets. Patrick swings at Julie, but Drew shoots Patrick in the arm and disables him. Patrick is arrested, Julie's father is safe, and Julie starts having a crush on Tobe. Once Sheriff Williams arrives at the police station with Patrick, he questions why he killed Doug, having nothing to do with Patrick's scheme. Patrick then tells Sheriff Williams that he didn't kill Doug, and it must have been Trevor Moorehouse, hinting that the real Trevor is still out there.  Later, Julie and Jamie say their goodbyes and Julie breaks up with Jason in order to be with Tobe, angering Jason. As Jason is walking home alone, Trevor Moorehouse appears behind bushes wielding a chainsaw, and Jason screams in terror, before the screen cuts out.

Boiler Room (film)
 In 1999, Seth Davis (Ribisi), a 19-year-old [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] dropout, runs an unlicensed [[casino]] in his home near the campus, catering to college students. Although he earns a successful living, he is a disappointment to his father, Marty (Rifkin), a [[New York City]] federal judge. One night, his cousin Adam (Kennedy) stops by the casino to play blackjack, bringing a rich associate named Greg Weinstein (Katt) along with him. Greg recruits Seth to join J.T. Marlin, a [[brokerage firm]] based somewhere off the [[Long Island Expressway]], promising him that he has the opportunity to get rich.  Arriving at J.T. Marlin, Seth attends a group interview and learns from Jim Young (Affleck), one of the co-founders of the firm, what is expected of his work and also how he can become a millionaire. The firm's techniques of selling are through [[cold calling]] investors to sell stock, and Seth joins as a stockbroker trainee, having to close 40 accounts and pass a  [[Series 7 Exam]] to begin working independently. The brokers love to quote insider trader [[Gordon Gekko]] from ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'', seeing him as a role model. He is soon making a good living, as well as winning his father's approval and embarking on a romance with Abbie Halpert (Long), a secretary and Greg's ex-girlfriend.  Eventually, he learns that J.T. Marlin is a [[chop stock]] brokerage firm that runs a "[[pump and dump]]", using its brokers to create [[artificial demand]] in the stock of expired or fake companies, and speculative penny stocks. When the firm is done pumping the stock, the investors then have no one to sell their shares to in the market, and the price of the stock plummets. The [[FBI]] agents investigating the firm decide to pursue Seth, hoping to make him their informant.  Seth passes his Series 7 Exam and becomes a broker. He then contacts Harry Reynard ([[Taylor Nichols]]), the purchasing manager of a gourmet foods company. Although Harry is reluctant, he gives in after Seth lies that the stock is guaranteed to go up in value; Seth sells him 100 shares at $8 each. When the stock's value drops, Harry calls back to ask why the stock has done so poorly, only to have Seth persuade him to buy more worthless shares. The stock eventually tanks, costing Harry his savings and his family.  Feeling guilty for scamming Harry, Seth resolves to shut the firm down. Marty then disowns him, accusing him of destroying peoples' lives. Seth shows up at his father's office and tearfully explains that he shut down his casino and went along with a highly criminal line of work that he thought was legal to gain his family's approval. He then requests that his father help him on an [[IPO]] scheme to rob the firm of their money and bring them down. Although Marty initially refuses due to the risk of losing his judgeship, he calls Seth the next day, reconciling with him and offering to help with the scheme.  Seth is eventually arrested by the FBI for the violation of 26 [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] and [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority|NASD]] regulations, and is brought into their custody along with his father, as the bureau had discovered their IPO scheme from a tape-recorded phone conversation. The FBI offer him federal immunity if he agrees to testify against J.T. Marlin once all the suspects are brought into court, and threaten to involve Marty in order to assure Seth's cooperation. Seth asserts that he will testify against the firm and provide strong evidence of their illegal practices only if his father is released. He and the agents come to an agreement on this, with Seth being kept overnight only to return to work the next day and make copies of investment files onto a [[floppy disk]] to use as evidence. After that, it is implied that he will be free to go as the FBI will proceed to raid the building and prosecute everybody else.  Seth returns to work the next day and goes along with the FBI's instructions. Before leaving, Seth attempts to get Harry's money back. He lies to Michael Brantley (Scott), the company's founder, by explaining that the firm can lose a lot of money by refusing to continue to do business with Harry Reynard, who Seth makes out to be an important prospect at a make-or-break point. Brantley agrees to proceed, offering him shares of the next IPO,  with a caveat that he cannot sell the shares until the firm has sold off theirs.  In order to sell the shares behind Michael's back, Seth needs a ticket sale signed by a senior broker, something that his direct supervisor, Greg, has explicitly said that he would never do. He seeks a signing from Chris Varick (Diesel), explaining that he may as well "do one thing right" in helping a severely hit investor make his money back, now that the firm will be raided and, soon enough, there will be no future in continuing business at J.T. Marlin. Chris reluctantly agrees, and proceeds to escape the building in an attempt to flee federal enforcement. Seth walks out to his car, deciding what to do with his life now that his ties with J.T. Marlin are finished. As he departs in his car, several FBI cars, buses, and tow trucks enter the parking lot, with agents storming out ready to raid the building.

Steve is still asleep, so Blue goes into the bedroom and helps Tickety Tock wake him up. When Steve wakes up, he needs help to get everything ready for the "You Can Be Anything You Wanna Be" show. Steve and the rest of his friends go into the kitchen to have breakfast. Periwinkle hears about a magic show as he heads off to practice his magic trick. Blue gives Steve a list of things to do. Steve makes up a plan about what Slippery Soap, Shovel and Pail, Mailbox, Tickety and Blue are going to sing about in the big music show. Tickety said Blue would be her duet and sing about being a classroom teacher.  Tickety loses her voice before the show, but she can ring her bells. The game Blue's Clues is played to decide who should be Blue's singing partner. Steve adds three clues to his list of things to do. But then Steve hears Sidetable Drawer singing. Sidetable tries to say something when Steve runs into the kitchen to help Mr. Salt find flour to make some chocolate chip cookies for the neighbors' snack. After helping him, Sidetable gives Steve the handy-dandy notebook.  Steve runs into the backyard, where Mailbox was putting up the posters to tell everyone about the show. Meanwhile, Steve finds the first clue on the handy-dandy notebook. After trying to figure out who should be Blue's singing partner, Steve realizes his clipboard is missing. Periwinkle shows his magic trick as he says the magic words: "Perry-pokus-okus-crokus". Then he heads off looking for Steve. Steve finds his list as Slippery tries to let him help find the hats. Sidetable is trying to ask Steve if she can sing in the show.  Slippery and Steve have a part that is perfect for Sidetable. She knows how sometimes she would hold all the hats on top of her table. Tickety, Pail, Mailbox, Slippery and Shovel are asking Steve what to do with all the stuff. Blue has an idea while helping Shovel and Pail make a doctor's costume. After putting things together, Steve and Blue help their friends make a house and put a curtain together to build the stage. When they are all finished, Steve checks their costumes and the stage. Then he walks back to the house, where Periwinkle is trying to show him his magic trick. Mr. Salt is in the kitchen trying to find the chocolate chips so he can make the cookies. While Steve was in the kitchen, Periwinkle shows the viewers another magic trick. Periwinkle was going to make a green knob disappear. He does so by moving it behind him with his tail. He then leaves, uncovering a clue on a different knob.   Steve appears and is disappointed that he hadn't found it himself. There's still one left, though, so he figures that maybe he'll find that one. Periwinkle, meanwhile, returns to find that Steve had left. He sadly comments that he's sure Steve would like his tricks, if only he had a chance to show him. After Mr. Salt delivers cookies, Steve checks snacks off the list and then notices that they still need to finish their song. So, Blue skidoos into a music sheet. There, Steve meets an anthropomorphic G-Clef (voiced by [[Ray Charles]]), who offers to help him write a song. While in the music sheet, Steve learns about notes. Some notes are high, and some notes are low (as shown on a staff). The notes then sing in unison from different pitches about putting the notes together. Steve also learns about rhythm & tempo. Steve then comes up with a song, consisting of the words beep bop bay. However, he feels his song is incomplete, even with rhythm and tempo. G-Clef tells him that music comes from inside. Soon, Steve develops a complete song and now there's only one thing left to do on the checklist and that's to find the last clue.   As Steve searches around for it, Periwinkle shows up for the third time to show Steve a magic trick. However, just as Periwinkle left to get the trick ready, Steve is called to Tickety and Blue to help Slippery. Steve had to help Slippery and walks away. As Periwinkle came back, the viewers told Periwinkle that Steve left again to help somebody. He complains that with Steve being so busy, he'll never get to see his magic tricks. Meanwhile, Slippery is having trouble rehearsing his act. He is afraid he will slip on stage. Steve tells him not to give up, but to go on. After hearing this, Slippery feels better. Upon returning to the real world, Sidetable tries to tell Steve her desires again, but once again fails. Steve then has her collect tickets.   After that, Steve tries to find the third clue himself, to little avail. He begins to think that he might never find it, but his friends tell him what he told Slippery, "Don't give up, just go on". Steve returns to finding the clue, and runs into a stack of boxes. A cardboard drawer lands in his hands, which is revealed to be not only the final clue, but Steve's very first clue! Steve was very triumphant and victorious. Steve happily gets out his notebook. Steve draws it and goes to the Thinking Chair. It is revealed that Blue wants Sidetable as her new partner. Steve goes to tell Sidetable, but Steve remembered that Sidetable was collecting tickets, Steve and his friends look for Sidetable by the end of the fence post.   When they got there, they didn't see her, so everybody split up to look for her. Periwinkle appears again, asking Steve if he'll watch his trick. Steve, instead, assigns Periwinkle and to the viewers to look for Sidetable in the backyard. They find her. It turns out that she was hiding and was sad because she believes she's not going to be in the big music show. She sings her song again, and after Periwinkle compliments her, she becomes happy again and is ready to tell Steve about her desires, yet again. Periwinkle then comes up with an idea to do for a magic trick. Periwinkle tells Sidetable that he will make her appear for everyone to see. He hides her under his cape and yells Everybody come here. Steve & his friends saw Periwinkle and he tells them to say the magic words which was "Peri-pocus-hocus-crocus". The trick works and Sidetable tells Steve she wanted to sing in the music show and Steve told Sidetable that they were looking for her because Blue wanted to be her singing partner in the music show.   However, Periwinkle was confused, as he thought it was a magic show. Everybody tells him that it wasn't a magic show, it was a music show, where they can do various things, like make up songs, do dances, tell jokes and wisecracks, and wear costumes, including singing. This, however, does not make him happy because singing isn't his strong suit, magic is. Disappointed, he hides under his cape. Tickety goes to Periwinkle and tells him not to give up and she offers that Periwinkle could do something else in the show. Purple Kangaroo then tells the group that the crowd is getting impatient. However, nobody is ready yet: Mailbox forgot his jokes, Slippery doesn't have his costume, Sidetable and Blue need more practice, Shovel and Pail search for the animals, and Tickety tells Steve that they need more time. Steve has them go practice, and tells Periwinkle to perform his magic to entertain the audience to keep them busy, while they get ready for the show.   As everyone prepares backstage, the audience is delighted by Periwinkle's tricks, until finally everyone's ready to start the show and he performs his final trick, "Peri pocus, ocus crocus, gotta gocus". When everybody is ready, Slippery goes onstage, and slips, just like he was worried about. Everybody tells him to not give up and go on. Slippery picks himself up and continues. After Shovel and Pail's doctor act, Mailbox joins in the show with a joke, getting stuck at first, but they help him to get free. After this, Blue and Sidetable both go on and sing. Steve then goes up and sings his song, overcoming his nervousness and finally everyone joins in for a reprise of the main number. The curtain closes, and opens revealing everyone. They thank the viewers for their help with a group singing the slower version of the "So Long Song" and Steve tells us to "Take a bow" after the song as the movie ends.

The Boondock Saints
 [[Irish American|Irish-American]] twin brothers Conner and Murphy MacManus attend [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]], where the priest mentions the fate of murder victim [[Kitty Genovese]]. Later, when Conner and Murphy are celebrating [[St. Patrick's Day]] with friends, three [[Russian mafia|Russian mobsters]] arrive and announce they want to close the pub and take over the land it is built on. A brawl ensues, and the next morning two of the Russians seek revenge on Conner and Murphy. The twins kill the mobsters in self-defense.  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Agent Paul Smecker is assigned to the case, and finds that the police and local news reporters see the MacManus brothers as heroes. The duo turn themselves in at a police station, where Smecker interviews them. After they retell their incident to Smecker, he declines to press charges and allows them to spend the night in a holding cell to avoid attention from the media. That night, they receive a "calling" from God telling them to hunt down wicked men so that the innocent will flourish.  Conner and Murphy resolve to rid Boston of evil men. Conner learns of a meeting of Russian syndicate bosses at a hotel. Having equipped themselves with weaponry and rope from a local underground [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] gun dealer, the brothers quickly kill all nine Russian mobsters, while Rocco, a friend of the brothers and errand boy for local mafia boss Giuseppe "Papa Joe" Yakavetta, is sent on a hit as an unknowing pawn. The next day, Rocco learns that he was betrayed, having been sent to kill nine Russians with only a six-shot revolver. Rocco commits himself to helping Conner and Murphy. That night, they hunt down and kill Vincenzo Lapazzi, an underboss of the Yakavetta crime family.  Concerned he may be a target, Papa Joe contacts a hitman, Il Duce, to deal with them. After killing a criminal that Rocco had a personal hatred for, the three men are ambushed by Il Duce. Although they manage to chase Il Duce away, the three men suffer serious wounds, including the loss of a finger by Rocco. The three return to a safehouse where they treat their wounds.  Hours later as the police conduct an investigation at the crime scene, the investigation seems futile since the brothers covered their tracks by spraying any blood left behind with [[ammonia]]. However, Smecker happens upon the part of the finger lost by Rocco and decides to do an independent investigation to see who was behind the gun battle. Smecker is able to track the evidence down to Rocco and his two allies. This leaves Smecker in a difficult scenario, and struggles with the choice of whether to prosecute the three men, or join them in their cause, as Smecker had become sympathetic towards the brothers' actions. After getting drunk at a gay bar and subsequently getting advice from a reluctant priest, Smecker decides to help the trio.  Later, the brothers and Rocco inform Smecker that they plan to infiltrate the Yakavetta headquarters to finish off the family, but Smecker learns they are walking into a trap. The brothers are captured, and Rocco is shot and killed by Papa Joe, but the brothers are able to free themselves. As Papa Joe leaves his house, Smecker arrives in drag and kills a number of soldiers before being knocked unconscious by Il Duce. As the brothers say their family prayer over Rocco, Il Duce enters the room and prepares to open fire. However, he instead finishes the prayer – revealing he is the brothers' father and deciding to join his two sons in their mission.  Three months later, Papa Joe is sent to trial for a third time. However, the reporters on-scene anticipate his acquittal. The brothers and Il Duce, aided by Smecker, infiltrate the trial after sliding their weapons over the metal detector. Unmasked, they make a speech stating that they intend to eradicate evil wherever they find it before reciting their family prayer and killing Papa Joe. The media dubs the three "the Saints".  
Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2
 In November 1999, tourists and fans of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' descend on the small town of [[Burkittsville, Maryland]], where the film is set. Local resident Jeff, a former psychiatric patient and obsessed fan, orchestrates a group tour of locations featured in the film. Among the group are graduate students Stephen and his pregnant girlfriend, Tristen, who are researching mythology and [[mass hysteria]]; Erica, the [[Wiccan]] daughter of an [[Episcopalianism|Episcopal]] minister; and Kim, a [[goth]] psychic. They camp for the night in the ruins of [[Rustin Parr]]'s house, where Jeff has placed surveillance cameras, hoping to capture any supernatural occurrences. Jeff becomes unnerved when he notices a large tree located in the center of the house's foundation, claiming it was not there before. That night, another tour group arrives at the ruins claiming to have jurisdiction over the grounds; Jeff and Stephen mislead them to instead visit Coffin Rock, lying and saying they witnessed something horrifying there earlier. The other tour group believes them, and leaves for Coffin Rock.   After drinking and smoking [[marijuana]] all night, the group awaken in the morning to find Stephen and Tristen's research documents shredded and strewn through the woods, and Jeff's cameras destroyed. Kim has a psychic inclination that the tapes are buried under the foundation, the same place that ''The Blair Witch Project'' footage was allegedly discovered; when Jeff inspects the area, he finds his tapes. The group's debate over the night's events is interrupted when Tristen suffers a [[miscarriage]], and they rush her to the Burkitsville hospital. In her hospital room, Tristen sees a pale young girl walking backward. After she is discharged, the group retreat to Jeff's home, an abandoned broom factory against a steep hill in the woods. While Tristen rests, the group review the footage recorded the night before, and find a visual anomaly of what appears to be a naked woman swinging around the tree in the center of the foundation; inexplicably, the tree appears in the footage as only a sapling. Jeff slows the footage down, revealing the woman to be Erica. Distraught, Erica claims she has no memory of such event, and goes to pray in another room. When Kim tries to console her, Erica reveals rash-like symbols covering her body, and proclaims the group has been marked for death.  Unnerved, Kim borrows Jeff's van to pick up coffee and alcohol in town. At the country store, she gets into a heated argument with the cashier. While driving away, she swerves to avoid hitting multiple children walking on the road, and crashes the van into a tree. While examining the busted fender, Kim notices the children have disappeared. Upon returning to Jeff's, she finds a bloody nail file stuck among the bottles of beer she purchased. The following morning, Jeff looks outside and sees the front end of his van entirely caved in, to the point that it is undriveable; Kim insists that she merely dented the fender. The group realize Erica is mysteriously absent, and begin searching for her. Kim finds her clothing on the floor, surrounded by lit candles. They attempt to call Erica's father at his office but are told by his secretary that he has no children.  Meanwhile, Tristen's disposition grows increasingly bizarre. The county sheriff calls Jeff, informing him the other tour group was found disembowled on Coffin Rock, and implies Jeff is involved. Shortly after, the four see Erica spinning around a tree outside. Stephen rushes to confront her, but the walkway connecting the building to the hill collapses under him. He calls for Tristen but she walks away without any regard while Jeff and Kim pull him to safety. Later while searching through a drawer, Kim finds a set of surveillance dossiers on herself and the others. She confronts Jeff, but he denies knowing the source of them. Shortly after, the group discovers Erica's corpse in a closet.  Tristen begins chanting about [[widdershins]] and speaking backwards; this leads Kim to suggest they play Jeff's damaged tapes in reverse. Upon doing so, they find the footage shows the group descending into a satantic ritual and frenzied [[orgy]] led by Tristen. When they attempt to confront Tristen, she alternately pleads and goads them; Jeff, convinced Tristen is possessed by the Blair Witch, begins filming the confrontation with a handheld camera, attempting to elicit a confession in Erica's death. Stephen accuses Tristen of killing their baby, and the four follow Tristen to the second floor, where she ties a rope around her neck and taunts Stephen, daring him to push her. In a fit of rage, he pushes her over the balcony, killing her by breaking her neck.  Later, Jeff, Stephen, and Kim are arrested and interrogated by police over the deaths of Tristen, Erica, and the other tour group. Each claim to detectives that Tristen was possessed by the witch and was responsible. Their accounts are contradicted by various video footage: Security cameras captured Kim murdering the store cashier with her own nail file, while Jeff's home monitors show him, nude, hiding Erica's body in the closet; the [[Video camera|DV footage]] Jeff filmed during Tristen's confrontation shows her pleading for her life as they accuse her of being a witch, ending in Stephen pushing her to her death.  
Boogiepop and Others
  When waiting for his girlfriend, Touka Miyashita, to arrive, Keiji Takeda sees a ragged looking man stumbling through the town. A short man in a black cloak speaks with the other man after he collapses, then berated the crowd for not helping. When the police arrive, the two escape, but what shocked Takeda most of all was that the cloaked man has the face of his girlfriend. The following day, Miyashita acts as if nothing had happened the previous day. Takeda sought to speak with her after school, but instead spots the cloaked man. Confronting him, the stranger introduces himself as Boogiepop. Boogiepop claims to be a [[split personality]], who has emerged to protect the world.  Boogiepop explains to Takeda that Miyashita is unaware of his existence, and would modify her memories to explain the blank periods. Boogiepop has appeared this time to face a man-eater hiding in the school. Through their discussions, the two come to accept each other, and become friends. In the end, Boogiepop appears to Takeda in Miyashita's school uniform, and explains that the crisis was over, so he would disappear. To the end, Takeda is sure that Boogiepop is merely Miyashita's repressed possibilities, rather than a monster-fighting hero.  Kazuko Suema has an unusual interest: [[criminal psychology]]. Despite this interest, she had little interest in the rumours the other girls talk about in class, about a ''[[shinigami]]'' named Boogiepop. While walking home with her friend, Kyoko Kinoshita, Kinoshita is attacked by Kirima Nagi, The Fire Witch. Kirima interrogates her about something, but stops when she realizes that she had only caught a 'normal' person; a drug-user. Suema confronts Kirima about this, but was told to let go of the events of five years ago – but Suema had never told anyone about that! Unable to let things happen without her being aware of them again, Suema searches for Kirima's house, and confronts her. However, Kirima reveals little about what she is doing, and only tells her that Boogiepop had saved her five years ago.  Masami Saotome joins a group date with Kusatsu Akiko. Late in the night, he drops a tablet into her drink; when she falls ill, he tells the others that he will get her home. Taking her to an abandoned building, he signals for Manticore to come; she turns the corpse into her loyal slave. Two months prior, Saotome had found the corpse of Yurihara at school, before himself being attacked by Manticore. Rather than panic or fight back, he told Manticore it would be better off leaving him alive and taking the form of Yurihara. In time, the two were deeply in love with each other, as they hatched their plan to conquer the world. As their experiments in controlling people begin to fail, and Kirima Nagi seems to be investigating too close, the relationship between Saotome and Manticore strains, until Naoko Kamikishiro came upon them, calling for Echoes. Manticore kills Kamikishiro, but for Saotome, this was the missing link: he has a plan to solve their problems.  Akio Kimura receives a letter telling him that Naoko Kamikishiro was dead. Two years ago, when they were in High School, he met Kamikishiro when she was confessing her love to Tanaka Shiro. Returning to his hometown to investigate the origin of this letter, Kimura runs into Touka Miyashita. Miyashita tells him that he should get over the disappearance of Kamikishiro, but Kimura tells her that an alien had taken Kamikishiro into space with him. Kamikishiro had told Kimura that she had met an alien named Echoes, who had been sent to evaluate humanity, but he had been [[cloned]]. His clone was now somewhere in their town, and he was looking to kill it before it killed the humans. As Kimura and Miyashita go their separate ways, Miyashita – but at the same time not Miyashita – tells him that Kamikishiro had "done her duty".  Tanaka Shiro approaches Niitoki Kei about the disappearance of Naoko Kamikishiro. Saotome Masami suggests they ask Nagi Kirima, a friend of Kamikishiro. Unable to find her around the school, Saotome suggests summoning her over the school's [[Public address|PA]]. Recognising a trap, Kirima cut the lights to the PA room, and knocked out the three students with a [[electroshock gun|stun gun]]. When they came to, they were presented to Echoes, who indicated that they were normal humans. After they were released by Echoes, Saotome stabbed him in the throat with a poison-filled mechanical pencil before Manticore attacked. Saotome then slashed Kirima's throat, killing her.  By the time Niitoki comprehended the situation, Echoes was being defeated by Manticore. However, he points to the sky, and transforms into light. Echoes directs the beam of light towards Manticore, but Saotome intervenes; he just barely saves her, but was killed instead. Hoping to take this chance to escape, Niitoki runs, but Manticore pursues. Hearing someone whistling ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'', she heads towards the sound. Niitoki trips, but Manticore becomes trapped in a wire. Niitoki's savior has the face of Miyashita Touka, but claims to be Boogiepop. While Manticore is trapped, Boogiepop calls for Tanaka to shoot it with an arrow; an arrow to the head finishes the creature. Finally, Kirima rises from the dead, apparently resurrected by Echoes as he left.  
Born to Be King
 The story starts with Chan Ho-Nam ([[Ekin Cheng]]) still being paranoid about the horrific death and his relationship with Smartie ([[Gigi Lai]]) which constantly gives him nightmares. After having Mei Ling ([[Shu Qi]]) hinting that she wants to get married to Ho-Nam, Ho-Nam shown little to no reaction due to the fear of losing another loved ones. That night, Ho-Nam goes to his pub only to be noticed that Chicken ([[Jordan Chan]]) was set up by Taiwan's San Leun Triad to be married into a Yakuza family as a political marriage. At that wedding day at Japan, Ho-Nam met with Akira Kusakari ([[Roy Cheung]]), the Yakuza leader's adopted son. At the wedding venue, Hung Hing's attending members were met by Chicken's cousin and one of the district leader the Taiwanese gang San Leun, Koh Chi-Wah ([[Blackie Ko]]) who then introduced to the son of San Leun's dragonhead, Lui Fu-Kawn ([[Peter Ho]]) and after the meeting, the wedding start and ended in hilarity.  After the wedding, Hung Hing's attending members like Ben-Hon ([[Wan Yeung-ming|Vincent Wan]]) and Sister 13 ([[Sandara Ng]]) followed Chi-Wah to a restaurant to celebrate. Out of happiness for his cousin and the recent victory of [[Chen Shui-bian]] as the new Taiwanese president, he over enthusiastically sang a Hokkien song which irate a bunch of Chinese nationals behind the group which soon turned into a brawl with the Chinese splashing tea on Chi-Wah. Chicken and Akira stopped the brawl in time and the next day, Chiang Tin-Yeung ([[Alex Man]]) finally met Ichio Kusakari ([[Sonny Chiba]]) and Ichio discussed about a triparte alliance between them, Hung Hing and San Leun but Chiang announces his retirement to return to Thailand and declares that his position and all affairs of Hung Hing will be passed on to Ho-Nam. Hearing of Chiang's plans for retirement, Ichio too thought of retiring and leaving the business to the younger generation where he picked Chicken as his successor. After the meeting, Ichio praised Hung Hing's members for their strength and agility and curiously asked if they knew anything about Kendo. Chiang jokingly told Ichio that he may pass some knowledge to them where soon, a Kendo match was held and Ho-Nam took the plate and fought Ichio. Ichio managed to initially beat Ho-Nam by disarming him. Not be seen as a loser or a weakling, Ho-Nam used his countless battle skills on the streets of Hong Kong into good use by tying his weapon to his hand and fought mostly singlehandedly like how he's used to and managed to force Ichio into a draw. Back in Taiwan, San Leun was also having a meeting to talk about the new leadership of the gang. Fu-Kwan denied the request to be the new dragonhead as his long period of stay in the US has made him unfamiliar with Taiwan despite being Taiwanese so Chi-Wah recommended Chicken due to his contribution to the gang but Chicken himself also denied the request as he had no ambitions to be the dragonhead and stated that "Picking a dragonhead shouldn't be about his nationality or whether he's a Taiwanese or can he speak Min-Nan language but more of courage and tenacity". Due to the constant rejection from another gang leader to appoint Chicken as the new suggested dragonhead, Chi-Wah again nearly came up to brawl with the other person. A few days later had passed and Fu-Kwan was met with an accident. As the dispute about the new San Leun's leadership contention wasn't settled, Chicken was instantly blamed for causing the crash but as he arrived at the hospital after receiving the news, he declared he's not the one to do it and Fu-Kwan believes him. Despite the infightings, Chicken was brought to a meeting with an old Taiwanese mafia boss who told the present that the situation is changing and the new government wants nothing but for the gangsters to cooperate with them. Chicken went to ask a veteran gang leader on his views. After that, both Chicken and Chi-Wah went to a karaoke lounge to have fun and a bunch of girls flirted with them. Suddenly, a girl that was ontop of Chicken took out a dagger and tried to stab at Chicken, who saw the dagger, fought her off and both guys flee the lounge. Both fled towards a mainroad but found both sides to be surrounded by gangsters of unknown origin and the two guys instantly fought their way out. However, Chi-Wah blocked the gangsters off for Chicken to run away only for him to be hit in the head and laying on the ground with Chicken fighting to get him out but failed and saw Chi-Wah being beaten to death while being extricated. At the same time, Nanako ([[Anya Wu]]), Chicken's wife, was alone at him and Akira came to visit drunk. While Nanako was taking care of him, he professed that he had always loved Nanako but it was his father's mistake to not let them be together and forcefully raped Nanako.   While taking care of his still-shaken wife, Chicken's buddies, Ho-Nam and friends, came to Taiwan to find out what was happening. Knowing how the current politics is useless and in disarray and his support, Chi-Wah, dead, Ho-Nam declares his full support for Chicken together with Dai-Tau/Big Head ([[Chin Kar-Lok]]) and Pou-Pan ([[Jerry Lamb]]). However, Chicken told not not to worry as he'll settle his own issue and their arrival to support him had already made him happy. Ho-Nam then went to meet Mei Ling who was shopping. She's late due to buying a watch for Ho-Nam but with Ho-Nam passing the watch back to her, in a fit of anger, she storms off and at the corner of his eye, he saw a girl that looked very much like Smartie. Curious, he followed her to her workplace at an kindergarten and both had a chat and learnt that her name is Rong Yu and she's also from Hong Kong and both became friends. At the safehouse where Chicken was hiding, his underling noticed a bunch of cars approaching the house and in a panic, shouted that their under attack. Whilst preparing for an ambush, it turned out that the "unknown personal" was Ichio sitting on a wheelchair who came to look for Nanako and Chicken. After comforting Nanako, Ichio explained to Chicken that Akira was a traitor who sold the Yakuza's evil deeds to the police and Akira was the cause of his disability. Vowing for vengeance for both Ichio and Nanako, Chicken promises to kill Akira. At the meantime, Fu-Kwan was released from hospital and it was revealed that the assassination attempt on Chicken and Chi-Wah was all along orchestrated by Fu-Kwan to rid Chicken from San Leun. Ho-Nam then met with Fu-Kwan who questioned San Leun's internal conflict and their intentions on dealing with Chicken. Fu-Kwan, again lied and said that he had never doubted Chicken to be the one that caused him to be hospitalized but directly after Ho-Nam left the meeting, it was shown that both Akira and Fu-Kwan had always been working with each other in getting rid of Chicken. Ho-Nam then went to meet with Rong Yu and Mei Ling, who had always sensed that Ho-Nam was odd, followed him in the shadows and noticed both Rong Yu and Ho-Nam together. Mei Ling then followed Rong Yu back to the kindergarten where she voiced her displeasure about her relationship to Rong Yu.   At the funeral of another contender of the leadership of San Luen (The one that had bad blood and gave advice to Chicken earlier in the show), things escalate out of control when Chicken entered the funeral hall and the whole of San Luen mobbing him. To control the situation, Ho-Nam took out a pistol and fired warning shots in the air. At the same time, Ichio entered the hall and declared that till Chicken is deemed the traitor, his life will be in Ichio's hands and if Chicken is found guilty, he will end Chicken's life himself. After the funeral, Chicken and Hung Hing's other members discuss plans on crippling Fu-Kwan's rising power. Knowing that he's already aligned himself with the new government and had planned to rename San Leun something else, they estimated that attacking Fu-Kwan head-on will be suicidal due to his ties with the government. During Chen Shui-bian's inauguration day, Fu-Kwan gave a speech on his ambitions of incorperating all gangs in Taiwan into an umbrella cooperation and plans to combine both Chi-Wah's "Black Panther Gang" and Chicken's "Venom Snake Gang" into a new entity with Akira at the helm. Chicken and the whole of Hung Hing bursts into the arena and Chicken declared Fu-Kwan the betrayer of San Leun with a traitor spilling out that the assassinations that had happened were all plotted by Fu-Kwan. With his family in Hung Hing's hands (The ploy Hung Hing came out with to threaten Fu-Kwan's power), the strategist of the gang had no choice but to spill the beans that what Chicken and the traitor who accused Fu-Kwan was right as everything that's happening to San Leun was done by Fu-Kwan. Soon after, the official who negotiated with Fu-Kwan also declared that the deal between San Leun and the government is off due to the ridiculous request of Fu-Kwan. Sensing defeat, Fu-Kwan slowly backs away from the crowd only to pull a pistol and firing a few rounds before fleeing with Akira. Ho-Nam and the rest gave chase. Akira nearly escaped but only to land himself in a hall where Ichio was waiting with Chicken for him. Surrounded by both ends, Akira instantly acts pitiful and asks for forgiveness. However, Ichio was having none of it and threw Akira a [[Wakizashi]] to commit hara-riki but instead of using it on himself, he flipped the dagger towards Ichio only to be disarmed by Ichio himself and dropped the dagger. Chicken then promptly took the dagger and stabbed Akira to death. At the same time, Ho-Nam was still chasing Fu-Kwan and both of them were driving themselves into a head-on collision. Both were not injured and soon climbed ontop of their cars and continued fighting. Ho-Nam beats him easily but Fu-Kwan again draws his pistol on Ho-Nam. Ho-Nam, having no fear, inches closer to Fu-Kwan's barrel and few seconds later, the police arrives to arrest Fu-Kwan.   The story ends with Akira thanking the Taiwanese official for his assistance and revealed that Akira himself can actually speak Mandrin all along.

Bookwars
 ''BookWars'' is a creative [[documentary]] which is told in an unconventional, narrative style. The film opens with the narrator (who is also the film's director) driving out West along a desert highway, relating to the audience his previous experiences as a streetside [[bookseller]] in [[New York City]]. The entire documentary – including the central events involving his experiences among the street booksellers in New York – is thus "told" as a long conversation.  The narrator describes his post-graduation years in New York, and how he ended up at one point virtually penniless. Driven by a desperate need to pay the rent, he resorts to wheeling his own books out to the street to try to sell them. He reveals that he was not only successful in making a significant amount of cash on that first day, but he has also met a variety of interesting and strange characters of the streets of New York – including other street booksellers.  A motley assortment of street booksellers on West 4th street, in [[Greenwich Village]], New York City, are first introduced. Among them: “Slick” Rick Sherman, a semi-professional magician; Al Mappo, so named because he only sells maps and atlases; Emil, who says only he "escaped”, though we do not know from where; and Pete Whitney: King of the booksellers, toad collector, and collage artist.  ''BookWars'' next introduces another group of street booksellers who hawk their trade on nearby 6th Avenue. Mainly black and minority individuals, they ply books and magazines in parallel fashion to the nearby West 4th street booksellers, who are primarily white. The booksellers on 6th Avenue suffer greater exposure to the law, with many claiming this to be due to [[racial profiling]].  Some of the significant personalities that are introduced on 6th Avenue include: Marvin, always wearing his trademark black hat; and Ron, from Jamaica – charismatic, streetwise and outspoken.  After the introduction of the primary characters (including the narrator bookseller himself), ''BookWars'' discusses, mainly through informal testimony, the various aspects of the street bookseller’s life in chapter-by-chapter fashion.  The tools and tricks of the street bookseller's trade are revealed: ways and techniques to maximize income; how to deal with difficult, and sometimes dangerous customers; where and how to get more books; how the booksellers have a right to distribute literature (commercially or otherwise) in public, as per the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]; and so on.  ''BookWars'' is structured as a “year in the life” style movie, although it was actually produced over several seasons, from 1995 to 1999. When Winter comes, and the streets are too snow-filled and cold to hawk books, the booksellers are shown in their various off-season modes and occupations. “Slick” Rick performs card and magic tricks at parties; Pete Whitney grooms cats for old ladies; and the narrator heads out to New Mexico to work on a [[Western (genre)|Western]]*.  (*Which was actually the movie ''The Desperate Trail'' [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109607/ IMDB])  Marv and Ron, however, continue to sell books throughout the winter on busy 6th Avenue, and the film follows them as they scour for books and pornographic magazines in the trash in Soho.  Finally, Spring comes, and the booksellers emerge from their off-season to sell books as usual for another season – or so they think. ''BookWars'' proceeds to reveal the street-level effects of then-New York City Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]]’s controversial “[[Quality of Life]]” campaign, which sought to remove informal, unregistered entrepreneurs and other individuals from the streets of New York City.  The NYPD [http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/home/home.shtml] begins to enforce obscure technicalities which govern the uses and dimensions of the sidewalks, thereby making it more difficult to earn a livelihood. A new tax identification number requirement is introduced, creating bureaucratic obstacles, especially for those street booksellers who are marginal or virtually homeless. Nearby [[New York University]] unlawfully places imposing, massive planters on the sidewalk in an attempt to drive the street booksellers away; and finally, especially on 6th Avenue where the majority of black street booksellers are active, the NYPD comes to haul away books.  The street booksellers resist and assemble to form an unlikely common front to protest against the actions of the city. Others, who have had their books confiscated, wait for hours at the police station to get them back. Still others, like Ron, rail against the futility of the city's efforts to stop New Yorkers from reading, because of their virtual addiction to books.  In the end, the street booksellers stand their ground against the Mayor, and are able to continue selling with minor adjustments to their way of life.  In the closing moments of ''BookWars'', the narrator admits that after all the recent problems with the city, he has grown restless; he realizes that he wants to do something different, and wants to change his occupation at last. A single massive rainstorm is enough to convince him to give up his street bookselling activities.  He sells the last of his books off to his fellow street booksellers, and heads out West, on a cross-country road trip, with the audience in the passenger seat sharing the ride.

Bounce (film)
 In [[Chicago]]'s [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare airport]], advertising executive Buddy Amaral ([[Ben Affleck]]) is delayed by a snow storm for a return flight to Los Angeles, on the same airline he has just signed as a big client. He meets writer Greg Janello ([[Tony Goldwyn]]), and when his flight resumes boarding, Buddy gives his ticket to Greg so he can get home to his sons, 12-year old Scott ([[Alex D. Linz]]) and 8-year old Joey ([[David Dorfman]]). Buddy convinces his friend and airline employee Janice Guerrero ([[Jennifer Grey]]) to allow Greg to take his place on the flight. While spending the night with fellow stranded passenger Mimi ([[Natasha Henstridge]]), Buddy sees on television that the flight crashed. He has Janice check into the computer system to remove his name from the passenger manifest and add Greg's name.    Greg's wife Abby ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]) is woken up by news of the crash, and for many hours is torn between hope and despair, clinging to the belief that Greg would still arrive on the later flight on which he was originally booked, until his death is confirmed.  Once back in L.A., the airline dictates that Buddy run a series of innocuous ads to ameliorate the tragic consequences of the crash, even winning a [[Clio Awards|Clio]] award. Crushed by guilt, Buddy drunkenly (and publicly) begins a stint in [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]. One of the steps in recovery is to make up for past deeds, with Buddy seeking out Abby, a budding realtor. Giving her a tip on a commercial office building that Jim ([[Joe Morton]]), Buddy's partner and boss, has put a bid on, in return, Abby treats Buddy to a night at [[Dodger Stadium]]. Their relationship blossoms, although both have secrets.   Buddy gets close to the whole family, and Abby reveals that she is not divorced; her husband died in an aircraft crash.  When the airline settles with Greg's estate, she next wants to put her boys on an aircraft to Palm Springs to get over their [[fear of flying]]. Buddy asks to go along with them, and soon develops a strong bond with the two boys. On the return trip, Buddy says he has a secret he will reveal the next day.   It all comes apart when Mimi shows up, with a video of Greg and Buddy having a drink in the airport bar. Abby is devastated by Buddy lying to her and demands that he leave her home and her life - though also demanding that he say goodbye to the boys. This does not sit well with anyone. Buddy comes back the next day and talks to Scott, who feels that his father died trying to get home for a Scout Christmas tree outing.   The relatives sue the airline for damages, and Janice's role is revealed when Buddy is called to testify. As Abby watches on television, Buddy explains that gave his ticket to Greg and did not take Greg's in exchange. In coercing Janice to change the roster, the airline's security procedures were compromised, getting her fired. Buddy remembered that Greg was not the good flier he once was, having had "too many people in his wallet". Buddy is excused by the judge, but does not feel "excused". Abby had harbored the same guilt as her son in pressuring Greg to come home on the fateful flight.   In being honest and facilitating the suit against the airline, Buddy realizes that he has to resign from his firm. Abby comes by to tell him that his talk with Scott had helped them both. Buddy, sensing that Abby is about to leave, asks her to help him rent his beachfront home or put it up for sale. As Buddy starts to talk about his plans, Abby realizes she can forgive him.

The Brainiacs.com
 To achieve his goal of more time with his widowed, [[workaholic]] father David, Matt Tyler and his best friend Danny decide to try to buy his business, Tyler Toys. Matt attempts to open a bank account at the Sunnyside bank, which is owned by fellow businessman Ivan Lucre. Though he quickly gains the admiration of loan officer Kara Banks, Matt's meager funds do not meet the minimum deposit requirement. When his older sister Kelly (confidentially) reveals she is working on a groundbreaking [[artificial intelligence]] computer chip, Matt and Danny create The Brainiacs.com and a fictional company called Global Consolidated Resources, which offers shares of stock as collateral for $1 of investment in the microchip.  The returns total $4 million, and the amount of money Matt and Danny have accumulated requires Matt to reveal his plan to Kara, who is deeply sympathetic to the boys' plan. After they leave, David walks in to apply for a loan to jump-start Tyler Toys' expansion program, which will sell the new Hairball toy internationally. After David and Kara disagree over procedural issues such that the loan does not go through, Ivan calls Kara into his office to brief her of his plan. Lucre instructs Kara to loan David as much money as possible, such that Tyler Toys will either succeed and give him profits, or fail and allow the bank to cheaply buy Tyler Toys and its assets. Additionally, his assistant Ms. Arbitrage, who worked with Tyler for Hairball orders overseas, cancels the next set of orders. The loan quickly maxes out to $500,000, which the financially struggling company cannot produce. Lucre's children Chet and Russell heard about Matt's "project" in economics class and ruthlessly bully Matt, letting him know that they are also out for blood. Matt buys a majority share in Tyler Toys, and as the new boss "Mr. Chips" (animated by a computer) institutes lax work regulations and gives his father a vacation. Lucre hires his nephew Miles to spy on David and his family in an attempt to weed out the mysterious competitor, and Chet and Russell attempt to attack Matt and Danny at school but are outsmarted.  Although David's vacation time allows him to spend quality time with his family, the downside is that Kelly is so happy spending time with her father that she completely loses focus on the computer chip, which has hit a major bug that may take weeks to solve - weeks that Tyler Toys does not have. When David returns to work, Mr. Chips assigns him to test Tyler Toys' ''entire'' product line, which wakes him up to the reality that the company has lost its magic. Further complications ensue when Mr. Toler of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] arrives at the Tyler house to investigate Global Consolidated Resources and its "super-chip" for potential [[fraud]]. Matt stalls Toler and asks Kara for help; she agrees to stall Toler only if Matt comes clean with his father.  On a camping trip the next day, Matt reveals to his father and sister that he bought the company and why; Kelly rounds on her brother, who is forced to admit that he betrayed their confidence. Even worse, Miles has recorded the entire conversation and reports back to his uncle. When David returns to Tyler Toys headquarters, he receives financial and emotional blows: Ms. Arbitrage was working for Lucre, and the company is scheduled to be auctioned off at an official hearing at noon the next Monday unless the $500,000 is repaid by then. Kara walks in on Ivan, Miles and Ms. Arbitrage toasting their victory and quits her job in disgust. In desperation, all of Tyler Toys works towards a functioning microchip before Monday, but its initial prototype fails to work. Kara assists David and Matt in compiling their financial records, but the team can only turn up $100,000 owed to them.  On Monday morning, Matt accidentally finds an abandoned steel box containing stock certificates. He immediately meets with his grandmother Miriam, who has been in town since Tyler Toys was bought out and drives the auction following the hearing up to $2 million, to everyone else's surprise. When Ivan demands that Miriam corroborate her bidding, she hands the stock to the judge, who promptly appraises it at $10 million. Miriam nonchalantly repays Lucre's loan and buys Tyler Toys, closing the case; the celebration is punctuated by David and Kara sharing a kiss. Although Miriam sets ground rules for her son before restoring the company's proper ownership, the ordeal has taught David his lesson. In revenge, Chet and Russell ambush Matt and blackmail him into signing over control of Global Consolidated Resources; Matt capitulates as he sees Mr. Toler drive up and then directs the FTC executive to the company's new owners, who are assessed a fraud penalty of $500,000 when they confess to not having the chip.  Despite the loss of the stock, Tyler Toys survives long enough for the microchip to be completed, which sees its first use metamorphosizing the Hairball into the intelligent, interactive Smartball; it becomes a global sensation that sells over a billion units and the signature item of Tyler Toys. Testing is underway for the Smartboard, a [[skateboard]] with a smart-chip implant, as the movie ends with a shot of the company billboard.

Bring It On (film)
 Torrance Shipman, a student at Rancho Carne High School in [[San Diego]], anxiously dreams about her first day of senior year. Her boyfriend, Aaron has gone to college, and her [[cheerleading]] squad, the Toros, is aiming for a sixth consecutive national title. Torrance is elected to replace the team captain, "Big Red" who is graduating. Soon, however, teammate Carver is injured and can no longer compete with her broken leg. Torrance holds an audition for Carver's replacement and gains Missy Pantone, a gymnast who recently transferred to the school for senior year with her twin brother Cliff, with whom Torrance develops a flirtatious friendship. While watching the Toros practice, Missy recognizes their routines from a rival squad that her previous high school used to compete against. After accusing Torrance of being a liar and stealing the routine, she learns from Torrance's offended and passionately defensive reaction that she was completely unaware.  So Missy drives Torrance to [[Los Angeles]], where they watch an [[African American]] team, the [[East Compton, California|East Compton]] Clovers, perform routines that are virtually identical to their own team's. Isis, the Clovers' team captain, angrily confronts the two. Torrance learns that "Big Red" regularly attended the Clovers' practices to videotape and steal their routines. In the meantime, Missy is seen as a threat by the other female members of the squad (because of her outstanding gymnastic abilities), but she ends up becoming Torrance's best friend and de facto co-captain.  Isis informs Torrance of her plans to defeat the Toros at the regional and national championships, which the team has never attended due to their economic hardship. When Torrance tells the Toros about the routines, the team still votes in favor of using the current routine to win; Torrance reluctantly agrees. At the Toros' next home game, Isis and her teammates show up and perform the Toros' routine in front of the whole school, humiliating them. The Toros realize that they have no choice but to learn a different routine. In desperation, they employ a professional choreographer named Sparky Polastri to provide one, as suggested by Aaron. But at the Regionals, the team scheduled immediately ahead of the Toros performs the exact routine they had been practicing. The Toros have no choice but to perform the very same routine. After the debacle that ensues, Torrance speaks to a competition official and is told Polastri provided the routine to several other teams in California. As the defending champions, the Toros are nevertheless granted their place in Nationals, but Torrance is warned that a new routine will be expected. Torrance, crushed by her failure to lead the team successfully, considers quitting.  Cliff encourages and supports her, intensifying their growing attraction. Aaron, however, suggests that she is not leadership material and recommends that she step down from her position, [[selling out|selling her out]] in the process to Courtney and Whitney who have set themselves up as Torrance's rivals. When Cliff sees Torrance and Aaron together, he angrily severs his friendship with Torrance, to her distress. But her confidence is renewed by Cliff's encouragement and she convinces her unhappy team to create an innovative, new routine instead. She breaks up with Aaron, realizing his infidelity and his inability to be supportive, but Cliff still refuses to forgive her. Meanwhile, the Clovers are initially unable to compete at Nationals due to financial problems. This prompts Torrance to get her dad's company to sponsor the Clovers, but Isis rejects the money and gets her team to Nationals by appealing to a talk show host who grew up in their area. In the finals, the Toros place second, while the Clovers win. However, at the end of the movie, Torrance and Isis find respect in each other. Cliff and Torrance share a romantic kiss.  Bloopers run alongside the end credits, as the characters dance and lip-sync to [[B*Witched]]'s cover of "[[Mickey (song)|Mickey]]".

Brother 2
 The film opens with Danila Bagrov ([[Sergei Bodrov Jr.]]) appearing on a television show with his two friends from the army. It is immediately known, that unlike the prequel's subplot, where Danila was an HQ clerk, he is, in fact, a combat veteran from the [[First Chechen war]] (which immediately explains his non-amateur performance and skill in the first film). All three comrades now live in [[Moscow]], where Ilya Setevoy ([[Kirill Pirogov]]) is a professional programmer who works for the [[State Historical Museum]] on [[Red Square]] whilst Konstantin (Kostya) Gromov ([[Alexander Dyachenko (actor)|Alexander Dyachenko]]) works in the security department for the Nikolayevsky Bank. Danila himself reveals his ambition to enrol in medicine at the university.  After the program, the friends retire to an exclusive public bathhouse (the [[Sanduny]]) where Kostya reveals to his friends that his twin brother Dmitry is an [[ice hockey]] player for the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] and is being blackmailed by an American '[[entrepreneur]]' Richard Mennis ([[Gary Houston]]) . According to Konstantin, his brother once played for his home club, the [[Sokil Kyiv|Kyiv Falcons]] before he was invited to play in the [[NHL]] and emigrated to the United States to play for the Chicago Black Hawks. Later he was signed by the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and from that moment he started to have trouble and difficulties with the Ukrainian mafia, who have been threatening and pressuring him. Dmitry (also portrayed by Alexander Dyachenko) was desperate and appealed to the local [[Chicago]] kingpin businessman Mennis for help and protection. Mennis took Dmitry under contract and granted him protection, but left Dmitry as an indentured servant. as all the proceeds are pocketed by Mennis. In the end, Konstantin says that Mennis has come to Moscow to meet his employer, the owner of the Nikolayevsky Bank, Valentin Belkin ([[Sergey Makovetsky]]) to discuss a business proposal.  Almost simultaneously in a different part of Russia, that same television program was being watched by Danila's brother Viktor Bagrov ([[Viktor Sukhorukov]]) and their mother. Seeing how her older son has turned into a drinking police sergeant, whilst her younger one is now on TV, she pleads with him to travel to Moscow and seek his brother there, as his life back home was bringing her little happiness. The irony of the scene is that in the first film it was exactly the opposite, where Viktor was the role model. After the bathhouse, Danila meets up and begins an affair with a Russian pop singer [[Irina Saltykova]] (playing herself), who he met at the TV station and crashed at her apartment in the elite [[Kotelnicheskaya Embankment]] building.  The next morning Kostya approaches Belkin and pleads to remind Mennis about his brother. Belkin agrees, but Dmitry Gromov is of little concern to both of them, as Belkin, being a Russian kingpin with money laundering partners, wishes to legalise their assets by investing in American companies, and needs Mennis' help to bypass standing law which prohibits foreign capital. The importance of the new friendship with Mennis prompts Belkin to remove Kostya altogether. That evening Danila stops at Kostya's apartment to discover his friend shot and sets out to avenge his friend. Knowing about his employer's lucrative deals, and Konstantin's desire to help his brother, there is little doubt who was behind the murder.  After himself being briefly arrested and beating up some thugs in jail, Danila pairs up with Ilya to begin their revenge. First, he clears out his apartment, where it turns out that only a small stash of money, that he carried from the first film remain. A visit to the black market results in a CD with personal information about Belkin. A visit to a local neo-nazi friend of Ilya's gets them armed with trophy guns and grenades from the [[Great Patriotic War]]. Based in the museum at the Red Square, they almost miss his brother, Viktor, who arrived in Moscow earlier that day. With his help, Ilya manages to quickly steal a car for the job.  That day, a concert is held in an elite [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], where Belkin's son Fedya is studying. Danila fools the security as latecomers, whilst Viktor distracts the other drivers/guards outside, making the impression that his "boss" i.e. Danila is a very active member of the Russian underworld. Inside Danila arrives just to see Fedya being summoned to the stage where he reads a very patriotic poem, which deeply moves Danila. Intercepting him off-stage, he thanks him for the poem and introduces himself as his new teacher. With his cover in force, he approaches Belkin and invites him to the staffroom for a private conversation about the school's sponsor. One-on-one, at gunpoint he confronts him and inquires about Kostya's murder. Belkin reveals that it was not his doing, but under the pressure of Mennis, he talks of his illegal operations including smuggling of pornography and extortion. Afterwards, he pleads for mercy, which Danila grants, saying "it would be a shame to leave such a kid with no father".  After the run, the trio clear the museum, whilst Danila gives Ilya his remaining money to purchase passports and tickets to Chicago. Upon Viktor's insistence, they also take a [[Russian M1910 Maxim]] exponent. Belkin refuses to let Danila off, although it is revealed that Kostya's murder was unintentional, as he only wanted him sacked, however his stunt in the school now threatens his whole operation with Mennis. Belkin's thugs, reviewing the TV recording, first raid the museum but arrive too late. They issue orders to their contacts in the police to intercept the car, but Ilya's documents do not arouse any suspicion when inspected by the traffic patrol. Danila, however, decides to pass time with Saltykova, inadvertently bringing Viktor with him. Whilst Viktor tells Irina about this opinion on Russian pop music, Belkin's thugs find the stolen Volvo in a parking lot in front of the Kotelnicheskaya building. Saltykova's chauffeur Boris calls Danila and warns him, and the Bagrov brothers first ambush the mobsters and then lead them on a daring chase through central Moscow, into a closed alley, where Viktor makes quick work of the cars with his Maxim gun. News of Bagrov's success enrages not only Belkin but also his "partners" who begin doubting the security of their operation. Powerless, Belkin is forced to alert the Ukrainian mafia in Chicago, in case his thugs fail to intercept him in Moscow.  To avoid capture, the brothers fly to America separately, and Viktor passes by Belkin's thugs without any suspicion in Moscow, and the Ukrainian thugs in Chicago. Danila instead lands in [[New York City]] where he travels to the [[Russian Jewish]] [[Brighton Beach]] community. There he buys a cheap beat-up car to travel to Chicago by road, but it breaks down just outside Pennsylvania. Stranded he is saved when a [[trucker]] Ben Johnson ([[Ray Toler]]) picks him up. Despite Danila's limited English, the two become close friends and on his way to Chicago, Ben shows Danila much about American life. Upon their arrival in Chicago, Ben offers Danila to pick up a [[prostitute]]. The bald prostitute Marylin turns out to be a Russian named Dasha ([[Darya Lesnikova|Darya Urgens Lesnikova]]). Though not interested in sex, he gives her some money, but the charity is quickly snatched up by her Black American pimp.  Back in Moscow, Belkin is still determined to catch Danila, but a background check revealed the bald man accompanying him (i.e. Viktor) is a professional assassin ''Tatarin'' and that he was on board the flight to Chicago. Paranoid, Belkin warns Manis and re-alerts the Ukrainian mafia in Chicago to find him. Simultaneously he dismisses his thug's suggestion to raid Saltykova, due to her fame, but instead commissions them to wire her phone. Foreseeing this, Danila created an alibi that he was travelling out of town for a few days and keeps deceiving Irina, and thus Belkin throughout the film.  Viktor meanwhile arrives in the [[Ukrainian diaspora]] district in Chicago quickly begins to spend his money wisely (and gaining more by beating up a police officer), enjoying the American lifestyle, making tours of the city dressed as [[Al Capone]]. Danila sticks to the mission, and first attempts to meet up with Dmitry Gromov, but is unable to catch him. Nor are his attempts to rendezvous with Viktor successful as Viktor is too much enjoying his life. Badly needing a translator he decides to find Dasha and travels to the Black neighbourhood. Just before he can run away with her, he is savagely beaten by Dasha's pimp's henchmen. The Police let him go on the basis of recognizance and he gets revenge by tricking the same group who beat him up into selling him weapons, which he steals by subterfuge. Afterwards, Dasha's pimp attempts to get even with her but is in turn killed by Danila, leaving Dasha no choice but to go with him.  Finally, Viktor and Danila meet up and the three enjoy an evening campfire on the beach of [[Lake Michigan]] where they share their experiences and attitude towards American society. Dasha tells her story of how she came in the early 1990s as an exchange student, worked in escort service in New York before finally degrading into a street hooker. Viktor, on the other hand, is much too impressed with the power of money that drives America. Danila instead shows his patriotism, first offers Dasha to come back home with them, replying to her "what will I do there?" with the "What have you achieved here?" inferring to her social status. As for Viktor, Danila reminds him there are things that money can't buy. The philosophical discussion is broken by a homeless black man, who stumbles across them and is insulted when Danila called him a ''negr'' (not knowing that the word is an insult in English). While waiting for a fight to come, Dasha replies that she believes that the primal nature of black people drives fear into white people, which makes them ultimately stronger. However, Danila's warning shot into the sand quickly forces the attackers to run.  Afterwards, Danila begins to finally move in against Mennis, and first hitting his front the ''Club Metro''. Expecting Mennis to be there he sneaks a weapon into the toilet, and then during a Rock concert evening involving [[Bi-2]] band, he kills every member of Mennis' mafia he encounters in the basement. Mennis turns out to be absent. Viktor seeing he picked up the tail of the Ukrainian mafia decides to draw them away and kills their hitman but not before learning of the mafia's operations. The next morning Danila climbs 50 or so floors on a skyscraper's [[fire escape]] to reach Mennis' office. There he catches him in a game of chess, and killing his colleague, finally confronts him alone. As if continuing the debate on the lakeside, in his monologue (in Russian) he asks the American if power really comes from money. Arguing that his brother (whose photo is lying next to the chess table) believes this theory, Danila instead thinks that power lies in the Truth. He (implying Mennis), being rich is not strong, as he took his money from someone else. Thus the tricked person is right, so he is stronger. In conclusion, he demands that Mennis hand over all the money he took from Dmitry.  Giving Dmitry his money, Danila sets off back home to Moscow but unintentionally drives through the Ukrainian neighbourhood where he witnesses a police siege around the former headquarters of the Ukrainian mafia, where Viktor killed everyone inside. As he is dragged out handcuffed, Viktor shouts his intentions to stay in America. The film ends with Danila and Dasha taking off to Moscow. The final call to Irina is not intercepted, as presumably, Belkin is also removed by his "investors", who in an earlier scene, face to face told him, that the sum of money he set up in this operation is too much to be risked. Danilo and Dasha (Maralyn) Board the plane to Moscow. Dasha is told that she will never be able to enter the United States again, But she does not care, signalling an intention she will never come back to America. The scene ends with the view from the plane - as it heads back to Russia.  
Bruiser (film)
 Henry Creedlow (Jason Flemyng) is a businessman who lives a unhappy life; his high-strung, contemptuous wife Janine (Nina Garbiras) is indifferent to him which leads to him having fantasies about suicide. Henry drives to a local train station where he meets with his best friend, Jimmy Larson (Andrew Tarbet) to go to work downtown. Apparently, Jimmy has invested some money for Henry, and Henry's return is much lower than he thought. While trying to board the train, an unsettled Henry imagines himself pulling away a pushy lady and struggling with her until he puts her head under the railroad tracks, allowing a passing train to crush her head. Waking up from his fantasy, Henry boards the train with Jimmy.  Henry works at a local magazine company called ''Bruiser''. While at the office, everyone is at a conference meeting deciding on which model should be on the magazine's latest issue. The sleazy and reprehensible boss, Miles Styles (Peter Stormare), mocks Henry's choice in front of him and his co-workers. Later that day, Henry talks with Miles' artist wife Rosie (Leslie Hope), who works at the lead photographer, and there appears to be an attraction between them as she is the only person who is casually nice to Henry.  That Saturday, there is a party for the workers at Miles and Rosie's house. The cynical Janine goes off not wanting to speak to the weak-willed Henry, who is sitting for a plaster mold to be made of his face by Rosie, who also designs masks in her spare time. Rosie finishes the mask and adds it to her "garden of lost souls" in the backyard. She asks Henry to paint a design on the featureless mask, but Henry cannot think of anything to draw. Henry sees Miles and his wife across the pool in a very intimate moment.  While driving home later that evening, Henry confronts Janine about what he saw as her making the moves onto his boss. Incredibly, Janine hardly seems to care and she tells the distraught Henry that he is so weak-willed and a pushover, she despises living with him and firmly wishes that he were dead. Janine tells Henry: "You're going no place! You're nothing! You're nobody!" When they arrive home, Henry then has another fantasy about Janine pulling the car into the garage, and him getting out and killing her with an axe to her head. Janine gets back into the car and drives off into the night, leaving Henry all alone.  After drinking all night at his house, Henry awakes up the next morning as usual, and here is where the supernatural element of the film really begins; when Henry goes to the bathroom mirror to shave, he is shocked when he sees a white-faceless mask staring at him. Henry's entire face has inexplicably transformed into a faceless image. When Henry tries removing the "mask" he cuts himself. Henry hides when Katie, his once-a-week maid, arrives to clean the house. Henry watches the maid as she fills her purse and bag with silver and other items from his house. When Katie begins taking cash out of Henry's wallet that is left on a counter, Henry reveals himself and confronts his kleptomaniac maid about stealing from him. Henry attacks and beats her to death with the bag filled with stolen silver items. He wraps the body up in plastic and hides again when Janine comes home. Henry overhears a phone conversation in which Janine tells the person on the other line that she is going to leave Henry.  Henry follows his wife to the office which is closed for that Sunday where it is revealed that she and his boss, Miles, are having an affair. But it is Rosie who catches them first by bursting into a conference room and photographing Miles and Janine having sex on the conference table. When Miles chases his wife out of the building where Rosie tells Miles that she intends to leave him, Henry sneaks into the conference room where he reveals his new blank face for his wife. Frightened by Henry's faceless appearance, Janine attacks him, but he wraps an extension cord around her neck and pushes her out a window where she hangs to death.  Miles is distraught over his wife leaving him and of Janine's death. While giving a statement to Detective McCleary (Tom Atkins) who is the first policeman on the scene, Henry eludes the police and goes home. He hides from the cops again when they come to his front door to look for him to deliver the news of his wife's murder. While looking through his business files, he discovers that his friend, Jimmy, has more than likely been taking Henry's money for himself. After making it appear that he possibly killed himself and disposes of the maid's body by burying it in the back of his house, Henry phones Rosie and tells her not to go out of her house because he overheard the police who think that she might have killed Janine.  That afternoon, Henry visits Jimmy at the tennis club where he points a gun at Jimmy in the deserted locker room and reveals the business account papers which show that Jimmy has been pilfering money out of Henry's bank accounts and mutual funds for two years now. Jimmy tells Henry that it was Janine's idea to steal Henry's money so she could squander it for herself. Jimmy reveals that Janine has been cheating on Henry with him too. Jimmy offers to write Henry a check for the entire amount of $30,000, but Henry politely refuses. Then, Jimmy suddenly breaks character by pulling out a gun from his briefcase and tries to kill Henry. Henry fires back, fatally wounding Jimmy in the chest. With his last breath, Jimmy expresses no guilt or remorse for his betrayal (just like Henry's wife Janine, and the housekeeper Katie). Henry hides Jimmy's dead body in the trunk of his car and pushes it into the nearby lake.  The next day, still in the featureless mask, Henry goes to visit Rosie at her home to tell her what's been up lately. Rosie is also surprised by his white faceless image with some flesh-colored paint that he added on claiming that he has been working on his image. After he leaves, Henry calls 'The Larry Case Show', a popular radio program, and tells the host that he is 'Faceless' and has murdered three people. After listening to some advice by Larry Case, Henry decides that he needs to eradicate all the people from his life who wronged and betrayed him if he is to get his face back.  The following night, Henry goes to attend Miles' Halloween costume party, dressed as Zorro wearing a black cape along with his white mask which he blends in perfectly. Rosie is also there who is being tailed by Detective McCleary, who still thinks that she either killed Janine or had it done. Henry assembles a group of men from the office where they lure Miles to a second floor balcony where Henry tells his mean and ungrateful boss that he has set him up for a "grand finale". With the crowd of partygoers underneath, Miles is raised overhead on wires, as people have doing throughout the party. Henry aims a strong laser at Miles (intended for exploded the heads of confetti-filled dummies), and kills him, while the crowd cheers. As Henry walks away, he removes his black cape costume and hat, and his face suddenly returns to normal. Henry realizes that he has his face back when someone walks by and calls his name out. But he is also spotted by Detective McCleary who moves into apprehend him. However, Rosie shows up in a Zorro costume with a white mask on and yells at McCleary that she's the killer. Rosie tells Henry that she made a plaster of her own face and it was blank, just like Henry's. Now that his revenge is complete, Henry has his face back and he can start a new life for himself. Henry is then lost in the crowd and McCleary cannot get to him. Henry bids Rosie farewell and escapes into the crowd.  Some years later, a long-haired Henry is now working as an office messenger in another city. Henry passes by an office where an angry and loathsome executive is yelling at several people. After the man screams at the overly curious Henry who walks by, the mean executive tells him to come back to his office for he has a job for him.

Britannic (film)
 In [[Southampton]] in 1916, HMHS ''Britannic'', a sister ship of , has been refitted as a hospital ship for Allied soldiers fighting in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. Among the nurses who are to serve aboard her is Lady Lewis ([[Jacqueline Bisset]]), who is being delivered to [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] via [[Naples]], where her husband has become [[Ambassador]] for Great Britain. Traveling with her is Vera Campbell ([[Amanda Ryan]]), an operative of [[Defence Intelligence|British Intelligence]] posing as Lady Lewis' governess. Campbell is unnerved by the voyage, having survived the sinking of ''Titanic'' four years previously, losing her husband as well. She reports her mission to Captain Bartlett ([[John Rhys-Davies]]) who is dubious that a woman can do such a job.  A [[German Empire|German]] spy has boarded ''Britannic'' posing as the ship's chaplain, Chaplain Reynolds ([[Edward Atterton]]), and soon discovers that ''Britannic'' is secretly carrying a large amount of small arms and munitions bound for [[Cairo]]. Under the articles of war, Reynolds considers his actions against ''Britannic'' to be legal and initiates a series of sabotage attempts to either take over ''Britannic'' or sink her, including inciting the [[Irish people|Irish]] stokers, all members of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]], to mutiny.  Each sabotage attempt is foiled by Vera Campbell - with the eventual co-operation of the ship's crew. Unaware that Campbell is responsible, Reynolds finds himself growing attracted to Campbell whilst the voyage continues. As the two of them spend time together, they fall in love and Campbell has sex with Reynolds before discovering his true identity.  Reynolds blows a hole in the port side bow of the ship. ''Britannic'', mortally damaged, tries sailing for [[Kea (island)|Kea]] island seven miles away, but the beaching operation causes the hospital ship to sink even faster. Campbell discovers that William, one of Lady Lewis's children, has disappeared. Reynolds helps her and they manage to get the boy to a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] before it is lowered. Another massive explosion causes Reynolds to be trapped in a flooding room. Campbell helps Reynolds escape and the two of them make their way through the ship, swimming through flooded rooms, vents, grates, and corridors, eventually making it outside by swimming through a porthole and climbing aboard an empty lifeboat that was already lowered into the water, but still attached by its ropes to the ship.  Campbell and Reynolds notice a lifeboat filled with people getting pulled into the still spinning [[propeller]]s. They watch in horror as the lifeboat and its occupants are smashed to pieces by the spinning blades. Reynolds ties Campbell to a line thrown to them from a nearby lifeboat. Despite her protests that they both can be pulled to safety, Reynolds throws her into the sea after kissing her. Soon after, the lifeboat's ropes break and it begins to also get sucked into the propellers. Reynolds decides to commit suicide, staying aboard the lifeboat as it is smashed by the propeller blades. A few moments later, the ship capsizes, causing the [[Funnel (ship)|funnels]] and deck machinery to tumble into the sea as ''Britannic'' sinks beneath the waves. A British [[dreadnought]], HMS ''Victoria'' (which earlier helped ''Britannic'' fend off a [[U-boat]] attack), arrives to rescue the survivors. Reflecting on her experience, Vera quotes the poem "Roll on, Thou..." from ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' by [[Lord Byron]].

Angela is overweight and dresses flamboyantly in outfits that she designs and makes herself, standing out in stark contrast to the rest of their conservative [[Italian American]] neighborhood.  While competing in advancing levels of the Catholic school [[spelling bee]], Bruno decides to start wearing dresses. He wears them as a source of empowerment as well as feeling the need to express himself. He often identifies with [[angel]]s and, when challenged that he can't wear a dress to the spelling bee championship in [[Vatican City]], Bruno points out that even the [[Pope]] wears a dress. For his choice in outfits, Bruno receives heavy criticism from fellow students and faculty, especially the school's Mother Superior ([[Kathy Bates]]) as well as becoming a target of the school's bullies. Initially supported only by his best friend Shawniqua ([[Kiami Davael]]), as he progresses further in the spelling competition, his choices of self-expression eventually become accepted by his peers and his superiors. Bruno wins the spelling bee competition and meets the Pope. With the help of his grandmother, Helen ([[Shirley MacLaine]]), Bruno also begins to form a bond with Dino who, in turn, is inspired by his son to pursue his long abandoned childhood dream of becoming an opera singer, despite previously being unwilling to accept his son, even leaving the room before Bruno sings in a dress.

 When he was a young boy, Padmanabhan ([[Prabhu Ganesan]]) was driven out of his house along with his parents by an evil-hearted money lender ([[Nizhalgal Ravi]]), who gave him a condition: if by a stipulated time period Padmanabhan could raise enough money to buy back the house he could reclaim it as his own.  Since then, Padmanabhan has been living a very [[miser|thrifty life]], always counting the cost of his daily expenses. Even after marriage to Ramya ([[Ramya Krishnan]]), he still focuses on his finances, at times to the detriment of his personal relationships with his wife and relatives, who all live together in a small house. In a sub-plot, Padmanabhan hires a housemaid ([[Mumtaj]]), who turns out to be the estranged and separated wife of his boss's son.  The story focuses on Padmanabhan's attempt to raise the money to buy back his house and his struggles to adapt with changes in his life, including Ramya giving birth to triplets.

In a final twist to the story, after raising the money, Padmanabhan realises that it has been stolen from his motorcycle. In despair he is about to give up and officially hand over the house to the money lender, but then his boss's son helps him out by providing him the money just in time. The earlier delighted money lender is now shocked at realising that he must give up the house where his family members have long since settled, and orders his relatives to pack up and leave. He drags his two children out of the house and they burst into tears at the prospect of having to leave because they do not wish to do so. The weeping boys then plead with Padmanabhan to let them stay and promise him that they will buy him a much bigger house when they grow up. Padmanabhan, moved to tears, recalls his own heartbreak at being dragged out of his childhood home and agrees to let the family stay until the children have grown up. This puts the money lender to shame and contrition, and he admits having arranged for Padmanabhan's money to be stolen because he knew that he would raise the money eventually. He returns the money and asks for Padmanabhan's forgiveness, having realised the strength of his adversary's moral character.  At the end of the film, the housemaid Omana, who had since reunited with her long lost love, gives birth to triplets of her own in hospital.

But as time goes by she begins to suspect something's not right with her family.  First, there's Dylan's increasingly violent behavior, which includes the impaling of his pet guinea pig on a stake and his apathy towards the death of a friend. Kristie cannot understand how her son, who she had focused so much energy and love on since he was born, could have turned out so heartless. Then there's the fact that Elizabeth ([[Alice Krige|Krige]]), an old family friend, seems to be trying her hardest to replace Kristie and keep her away from Marc and Dylan as often as possible. Marc himself begins acting strangely, overreacting after a dog bite and hanging the dog in the backyard as punishment.  It becomes apparent to Kristie that something is very, very wrong, and that she is out of the loop. As her family withdraws further and further from her and she loses her best friend, Kristie turns to a mysterious taxi driver who seems to know a whole lot about everything. All Kristie wants is to save her son, even if it turns out that it is the [[Devil]] himself who is standing in her way.  With the help of the taxi driver, Kristie makes some shocking discoveries about her loved ones and comes to the conclusion that unless she stops him, Dylan will lead mankind into a horrifically malevolent future.  At the end, Kristie, who has now stopped caring for Dylan, escapes the hospital with Father Mullin and tells him it was a new time.  Father Mullin rips off his white collar tab and throws it out the window as they drive away.

 The film opens with Stanley on his boat in the middle of Summit Lake. After speaking with his agent, Regan over the phone, Stanley accesses a hidden room in his house revealing a young woman who is chained to the floor by her ankle.  He greets the woman and calls her Kimberly as he places a plate of food in front of her.  When he leaves the room, Kimberly walks over to the mirror and begins to cry, unaware that Stanley is studying her on the other side.  Afterwards, Stanley brings her a fresh change of clothes and instructs her to dress, before gagging her with an orange and binding her hands behind her back.  He forcibly escorts her onto his boat and drives out to the middle of Summit Lake, where he ties a cement block around her ankles.  Curious about her predicament, he asks Kimberly how she feels, but the terrified woman does not respond. Stanley then pushes her into the lake, but promptly pulls her back up by the hair to study her expression before letting her sink to the bottom.    Later, Stanley returns home to resume working on his script using the details he had gleaned from his latest victim.  The next morning, he dives to the bottom of Summit Lake to tend his "garden", which consists of several women kidnapped and drowned in a similar fashion.  Seeking yet another victim, Stanley discovers Mallory, a young woman working at a movie theater.  Intrigued by her self-confessed fear of water, Stanley follows Mallory after she leaves work and swerves in front of her, slamming the brakes on his van and forcing their vehicles to collide.   After checking on Mallory, Stanley turns his attention to his dogs, which are heard barking from the van. When Mallory follows him, Stanley throws the back doors wide and pushes her into the van.  The van is completely empty except for the recording of barking dogs, and an ominous message spelled out in yellow tape that reads, "I'm the person your mother warned you about." Stanley locks his new victim away in his secret room, but Mallory is defiant and shows him no fear.    Eventually, he lies to Mallory and tells her that he'll let her go free, but that she would have to face her fear and go for a ride on his boat.  He then blindfolds her and drives around for a while to disorient her before they board the boat.  Stanley attempts to drown her in the lake, but she is quickly rescued by local police officer Boone and a couple who own a movie special-effects shop nearby.  After taking time to recuperate, Mallory then gives the idea to make a plaster-mold of herself, with a camera as an eye, to catch the killer when he returns to his garden.   When Stanley returns to the bodies, he discovers the ploy and quickly escapes, his identity hidden by his scuba mask.  Mallory stays at a hotel room for the night, but is soon discovered and recaptured by Stanley who immediately prepares to drown her again.  However, complications arise when Stanley's agent Regan and the director to the film he is writing arrive at the cabin unexpectedly.  He kills the director with a cleaver, then imprisons Regan with Mallory.    He takes both women to the lake to drown them, but Boone and the other police dive in and quickly release Mallory.  Although Regan's body is recovered, Stanley is presumed dead, having snagged his leg on a rope in his own garden.  Mallory tries to recover from the experience, though she continues to be haunted by memories of her former captor.  A person is pitching a movie to a new agent, in which a killer buries his victims alive.  When the agent asks how the person feels as they are buried alive, the camera reveals the person to be Stanley with a new look, as he says "I'm still doing the research."

Sakura and Kero are contacted by Eriol from England, who explains the Nothing was created to balance the positive magic of the Clow Cards with her own negative magic. The Nothing was released due to Sakura changing the cards' power from Clow Reed's to her own, and every time the Nothing steals a card, her power erases part of Tomoeda.

Sakura learns the Nothing collected the cards so she would not be alone anymore, but Sakura promises that she will never be isolated again and seals the Nothing. However, the required toll instead comes from Syaoran who tells Sakura he will fall in love with her all over again.  The Nothing and the nameless card fuse into one, becoming the Hope Card as Sakura tearfully confesses to Syaoran. She is shocked when he replies that he feels the same, discovering that the fusion averted the toll. The Nothing's powers are then reversed, reviving Tomoeda and its inhabitants.

Cast Away
  In December 1995, Chuck Noland is a time-obsessed systems engineer who travels worldwide resolving productivity problems at FedEx depots. He is in a long-term relationship with Kelly Frears, with whom he lives in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Although the couple wants to get married, Chuck's busy schedule interferes with their relationship. A Christmas with relatives is interrupted when Chuck is summoned to resolve a problem in Malaysia. While flying through a violent storm, his plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean. Chuck escapes the sinking plane and is saved by an inflatable life raft, but loses the [[emergency locator transmitter]]. He clings to the life raft, loses consciousness, and floats all night before washing up on an island. After he awakens, he explores the island and soon discovers that it is uninhabited.  Several FedEx packages from the crashed plane also wash up on the shore, as well as the corpse of one of the pilots, which he buries. He initially tries to signal for rescue and makes an escape attempt with the remnants of his life raft, but cannot pass the powerful surf and the coral reefs surrounding the island. He searches for food, water, and shelter, and opens the packages, finding a number of useful items. He leaves one package, which has a pair of angel wings stenciled on it, unopened. During a first attempt to make fire, Chuck receives a deep wound to his hand. In anger and pain, he throws several objects, including a [[Wilson Sporting Goods|Wilson]] volleyball from one of the packages. A short time later he draws a face in the bloody hand print on the ball, names it Wilson, and begins talking to it. One night, Chuck calculates that in order for the rescue workers to find the site of the plane crash, they will have to search an area twice the size of Texas, making him doubtful he will ever be found.  Four years later, Chuck has adapted to the island’s meager living conditions, having become adept at spearing fish and making fires. He also has regular conversations and arguments with Wilson, his only means of socialization. A large section of a [[portable toilet]] washes up on the island; Chuck uses it as a sail in the construction of a raft. After spending some time building and stocking the raft and deciding when weather conditions will be optimal (using an [[analemma]] he has created in his cave to monitor the time of year), he launches, using the sail to overcome the powerful surf. After some time on the ocean, a storm nearly tears his raft apart. The following day, as Chuck sleeps, Wilson becomes untethered and floats away from the raft. Chuck is wakened by the spray of a sounding whale, sees Wilson, and swims after him, but Wilson has gone too far to safely retrieve. Chuck returns to the raft and collapses in tears. Later, a passing cargo ship finds him, drifting.  Upon returning to civilization, Chuck learns that he has long been given up for dead; his family and acquaintances have held a funeral, and Kelly has since married Chuck's onetime dentist and has a daughter. After reuniting, the pair profess their love for each other but, realizing they cannot be together because of her commitment to her new family, they sadly part. Kelly gives Chuck the car they once shared.  Some time later, after buying a new volleyball, Chuck travels to [[Canadian, Texas]], to return the unopened FedEx package with the angel wings to its sender, a woman named Bettina Peterson. No one is home, so he leaves the package at the door with a note saying that the package saved his life. He departs and stops at a remote crossroads. A friendly woman passing by in a pickup truck stops to explain where each road leads. As she drives away, Chuck notices the angel wings on the back of her truck are identical to those on the parcel. As Chuck is left standing at the crossroads he looks down each road, then smiles faintly as he looks in the direction of the woman's truck.  
The Cell
 [[Child psychology|Child psychologist]] Catherine Deane ([[Jennifer Lopez]]) is hired to conduct an experimental [[virtual reality]] treatment for [[coma]] patients: a "Neurological Cartography and Synaptic Transfer System" device managed by doctors Henry West and Miriam Kent that allows her to enter a comatose [[mind]] and attempt to coax them into consciousness. The technology is funded by the parents of her patient, Edward Baines ([[Colton James]]), a young boy left comatose by a latent viral infection that causes an unusual form of [[schizophrenia]]. Despite Deane's lack of progress, West and Kent reject Deane's suggestion to reverse the feed to bring Baines into her mind, fearing the unknown consequences of him experiencing an unfamiliar world.  [[Serial killer]] Carl Rudolph Stargher ([[Vincent D'Onofrio]]) traps his victims in a [[prison cell|cell]] in the form of a [[glass]] enclosure that slowly fills with water by means of an automatic timer, then uses a hoist in his basement to suspend himself above their bodies while watching the recorded video of their deaths. He succumbs to the same schizophrenic illness and falls into a [[coma]] just as the [[FBI]] identifies him, leaving them without any leads as to the location of his latest victim, Julia Hickson ([[Tara Subkoff]]). After learning of this experimental technology, Agent Peter Novak ([[Vince Vaughn]]) persuades Deane to enter Stargher's mind and discover Hickson's location.  Deane enters the dark [[Dream world (plot device)|dreamscape]] of Stargher's twisted psyche, filled with doll-like replicas of his victims.

Deane nurtures Young Stargher in hopes of getting Hickson's location but she is thwarted by another manifestation: King Stargher, a demonic idealization of his murderous side that dominates the dreamscape. King Stargher torments Deane until she is mentally at his mercy, making her forget [[Lucid dream|the world is not real]]. Dr. West discovers this while monitoring Deane's vitals. He warns that what happens to Deane while she is integrated into Stargher's mindscape will inflict neurological damage on her real body. Novak volunteers to enter Stargher's mind to make Deane remember herself.  Inside Stargher's mind, Novak is captured and subjected to King Stargher's torture while Deane looks on as Stargher's servant. Novak reminds Deane of a painful memory to reawaken her awareness that she is in Stargher's mind. Deane breaks free of Stargher's hold and stabs King Stargher to free Novak. During their escape, Novak sees a version of the glass enclosure with the same insignia as the hoist in Stargher's basement. Novak's team discovers that after the hoist's previous owner went bankrupt, the government hired Stargher to seal up his property. Novak races to the property, where the enclosure is completely filled but Hickson is treading water and breathing through a pipe. Novak breaks the glass wall and rescues Hickson.  Deane, now sympathetic to Young Stargher, locks her colleagues out and reverses the feed of the device to pull Stargher's mind into her own. She presents a comforting paradise to Young Stargher but he knows it is only a temporary reprieve from King Stargher. He shifts to Adult Stargher to relate a childhood story of when he drowned an injured bird as a [[Coup de grâce|mercy killing]] to prevent its torture at his father's hands. King Stargher intrudes as a [[Serpent (Bible)|scaly snake-man]] but this time, Deane is in control and she beats him to a bloody pulp before impaling him with a sword. However, Young Stargher exhibits the same injuries as King Stargher, and killing either manifestation kills Stargher. Adult Stargher reminds her of the story of the bird and implores her to "save" him. Deane carries Young Stargher into a pool, putting him out of his misery as Stargher dies in the real world.  In the aftermath, Deane and Novak meet outside of Stargher's house. The FBI has officially excluded the mind technology from their inquiry and Deane has gotten approval to use the reverse feed on Edward Baines. The final scene is of Baines walking to embrace Deane inside the paradise of Deane's mindscape.<ref></ref>  
Cecil B. Demented
 Honey Whitlock is a Hollywood [[A-list]] actress whose public persona is that of a sweet and considerate woman, but who is actually a profane, unreasonable, and demanding [[diva]]. While in Baltimore to attend a [[Film premiere|premiere]], Honey is kidnapped by the manic film director, Cecil B. Demented, and his band of misfit, [[Andy Warhol]]–worshiping artists who have branded themselves "[[kamikaze]] filmmakers", going by the group name "SprocketHoles". Each of the SprocketHoles has infiltrated the staff of the theater where the premiere is to take place; they subsequently kidnap Honey as she concludes her remarks on stages. In the ensuing mayhem, the group escapes.  Honey is taken to an abandoned movie theater where she is kept captive. Honey is introduced to Cecil's crew of followers, each of whom wears a tattoo of a noted filmmaker and reveals unique, individual quirks. Cecil explains that he wants to make his masterpiece film and needs Honey to star as the lead. At first she resists, shooting scenes with no emotion, but when Cecil demands better results, Honey gives an over-the-top performance in the film's opening scene which pleases him. Apart from the first scene, Cecil, Honey and the crew roam  around the city filming scenes at real (unapproved) locations, often involving innocent bystanders in the process.  The group's first location is a movie theater playing Patch Adams: The Director's Cut, which they storm with guns and smoke bombs before leaving with their footage. Several bystanders note in interviews that Honey seems younger and cooler than in her recent Hollywood films, but a spokesman for the Baltimore Film Commission "says no to cinema terrorism". Inspired, Cecil decides to invade the luncheon the Commission is hosting. The group crashes the event and Cecil orders Honey to jump off the roof of a nearby building, which she does without safety measures. A gunfight ensues between Cecil's crew and the police. As gunfire is exchanged, Rodney the hairdresser is killed and Cecil is wounded. Honey uses the opportunity to turn herself in to the authorities and they take her away in a police car, but she is retrieved by the film group soon after.  As Honey seems to become more comfortable with her situation, possibly developing [[Stockholm syndrome]], she watches a [[television special]] discussing her disappearance. Persons who knew her, including her ex-husband, are interviewed and come clean about how mean-spirited she was in daily life. Honey now realizes that her desire to escape would only lead her back to Hollywood, where she is hated for being rude. She resists the idea of joining Cecil's followers but changes her mind and declares herself "Demented forever", burning a brand into her arm and officially joining the motley crew.  After these events, the crew invades the set of the ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' sequel being filmed in Baltimore, at Honey's suggestion. When the SprocketHole crew arrives, they subdue and replace many of the film's crew. A gunfight breaks out between Cecil's friends and [[Teamsters]] who got free. Members of Cecil's crew are either killed or wounded. The surviving SprocketHoles and Honey flee to a nearby pornographic theater and seek refuge inside. The audience helps Cecil escape.  At their last location, Cecil is shooting the final scene at a local drive-in while law enforcement are alerted. Cecil and the crew take over the projection room, and he proceeds to excite the crowd into a frenzy. He asks Honey to light her hair on fire for the final shot (which she does). With the film finished, the SprocketHoles start having sex in public before the authorities step in. Cecil sets himself completely ablaze as police arrive, to give Honey a chance to run away. In the ensuing chaos, some crew members escape with the raw film footage while others are shot. Honey is taken into custody; she is surprised and pleased by the new affection shown to her by the crowd as she is put into the police van.  
Center Stage (2000 film)
 After a series of country-wide auditions, twelve young [[dance]]rs gain entry to the American Ballet Academy (which is loosely based on the [[School of American Ballet]]). They work hard, attending classes every day for weeks to make them the best dancers they can possibly be, and in preparations for a final dance workshop which will determine the three boys and three girls who will be asked to join the American Ballet Company (which appears to be based on either the [[American Ballet Theatre]] or the [[New York City Ballet]]). The workshop will also provide an opportunity for the students to showcase their talent to other ballet companies across the country. Gaining a leading part in the workshop is therefore essential.  Tensions mount between Jonathan Reeves ([[Peter Gallagher]]), the company's aging [[choreography|choreographer]] and director, and Cooper Nielson ([[Ethan Stiefel]]), his [[solo (dance)|best dancer]], who also wants to choreograph. They also have issues because Kathleen Donahue ([[Julie Kent (dancer)|Julie Kent]]), Cooper's ex-girlfriend and fellow dancer, left him to wed Jonathan. Star student Maureen ([[Susan May Pratt]]), a closet bulimic who seems poised for success, discovers that life is passing her by when she meets a pre-med student ([[Eion Bailey]]) who shows her the merits of a life without ballet, to the dismay of her controlling stage mother ([[Debra Monk]]), herself a failed ballet dancer and current ABC employee. Sweet Jody Sawyer ([[Amanda Schull]]), despite underdeveloped turn out, body type issues, and poor footwork, is determined to dance professionally, but it appears less and less likely as the movie progresses that she will be good enough. Jody's parents, Jonathan, Maureen, and ballet teacher Juliette Simone ([[Donna Murphy]]) try to convince Jody to move on from dance and attend college. Jody refuses to give up on her dream of being in a professional ballet company. Talented, but smart aleck Eva Rodriguez ([[Zoe Saldana]]; doubled by SAB alumna and former NYCB member [[Aesha Ash]]) from Boston loves to dance but seems destined to be stuck in the back of the [[corps de ballet|corps]] because of her bad attitude. Tensions also arise between Charlie ([[Sascha Radetsky]]), a naturally gifted fellow advanced student from Seattle, and Cooper over Jody; Charlie has a crush on Jody, who had a one-night stand with Cooper and remains infatuated with him.  Despite Jonathan's objections, Cooper choreographs a rock/pop music-based ballet for the workshop. Three ballets are presented; Jonathan and another choreographer create the other two respectively—the two more "traditional" ballets are not danced to actual ballet music, however. The first (not shown, beyond entrances of the corps and soloist from the wings) is to [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s ''[[Italian Symphony]]'', while Jonathan's ballet (choreographed by [[Christopher Wheeldon]]) is set to [[Rachmaninov]]'s 2nd Piano Concerto. Cooper's ballet (choreographed by [[Susan Stroman]]) mirrors the relationship between himself, Jonathan, and Kathleen. Jody, Charlie, and their gay friend Erik ([[Shakiem Evans]]) are set to dance the three lead roles when Erik sprains his ankle in a final rehearsal. To Jonathan's protests and Jody's apprehension, Cooper steps in to fill the role, and the tensions between Jody, Charlie, and Cooper play out on the stage.  After the final workshop, Cooper starts his own dance company, much to Jonathan's chagrin, as Cooper's financial backer is a wealthy widow who Jonathan was hoping would donate to American Ballet Company. Cooper asks Jody to be a [[principal dancer]], as her dancing style, though technically deficient, is perfect for his company. He also asks to date her, but Jody turns him down in favor of Charlie. Maureen decides to give up ballet because she finally realizes that ballet is just something she does well and not what she wants in life. She decides to attend regular [[university]] and also seek help for her eating disorder. Eva is picked by Jonathan to join ABC after proving her worth in the workshop, surprising everyone by dancing in place of Maureen as the lead in Jonathan's ballet. Charlie, and fellow advanced students and friends Anna (who was always favored by Jonathan and who danced "[[Gelsey Kirkland]]'s part" as the lead in the ''Italian Symphony'' ballet; played by SAB alumna and former NYCB corps member Megan Pepin) and Erik are also asked to join the American Ballet Company, and Sergei ([[Ilia Kulik]]), Charlie and Erik's roommate and friend, joins his girlfriend Galina in the San Francisco Ballet Company.  There is a subplot in which Cooper attracts the financial support of a flirtatious wealthy female philanthropist (played by [[Elizabeth Hubbard]]). An August 15, 2004 ''[[New York Times]]'' article entitled "How Much Is That Dancer in the Program?" revealed that Stiefel has a very similar real-life sponsorship relationship with a philanthropist named Anka Palitz.

Knox is believed to have been kidnapped by Roger Corwin ([[Tim Curry]]), who runs a communications-satellite company called Redstar. The Angels infiltrate a party held by Corwin and spot a suspicious-looking man that they had previously seen from surveillance videos of Knox's kidnapping. Dubbing him the "Thin Man" ([[Crispin Glover]]), the Angels chase him down and fight him; he gets away but the Angels find Knox, safely held nearby.  After the Angels reunite Knox with his business partner Vivian Wood ([[Kelly Lynch]]) Charlie explains that they must determine whether the Thin Man has stolen Knox's voice-recognition software. The Angels infiltrate Redstar headquarters, fool the security system, and plant a device in the central computer that will enable them to explore it remotely. They retire for the night after giving Bosley the laptop computer that communicates with the Redstar computer.  Dylan takes up Knox's offer to spend the night with him, and they end up having sex. Afterwards, Knox betrays her; simultaneously, attacks are made on Natalie and Alex, Bosley is captured by Vivian, and Corwin is murdered by the Thin Man. Knox tells Dylan his kidnapping was all faked to get the Angels to help him access the Redstar satellite network. He plans to use it along with his voice recognition software to find and kill Charlie, who Knox asserts killed his father in the [[Vietnam War]].  Dylan escapes and reunites with Natalie and Alex, all who survived their attacks. They approach Charlie's offices just as the building explodes. They find a radio transmitter that Bosley is able to communicate through via a radio transmitter implanted in a tooth. Bosley provides enough information of his place of captive to allow Natalie to deduce its location, an abandoned lighthouse. With help from Dylan's current boyfriend Chad ([[Tom Green]]) the Angels stealthily approach the lighthouse. They are too late from stopping Knox from determining Charlie's location, but they rescue Bosley and defeat Vivian, the Thin Man, and some henchmen before Knox blows up the lighthouse. Knox flies an attack helicopter towards Charlie's house, while Bosley helps the Angels board it. Alex reprograms the missile to have it shoot backwards, which blows up the helicopter and kills Knox while all of the Angels land safely together on the beach.  Seeing the opportunity to finally meet Charlie in person, they enter the beach house that Knox had targeted the missile at, but Charlie has already left. He remotely congratulates the Angels on a job well done through another speaker, and treats them and Bosley to a vacation. Charlie tells them that Knox's father was undercover; however, he was discovered and he was killed by someone else but not Charlie. When he speaks to the Angels unseen again by telephone on the beach, they ask if they could ever meet him in person. Dylan then suspects that she might be seeing him nearby talking into a cell phone, but she doesn't tell the group.

When Detective Derm ([[Gil Bellows]]) arrives, Derm takes pills similar to Saxon's. They check her workplace and listen to some messages on the answering machine. George Simian ([[Julian McMahon]]) has left a message, inquiring about his wife, and Derm remarks that her abandoned car was found near Simian's house. Saxon also has to deal with the college, annoyed that he didn't show up to teach his class, which leads one of his students, Sadie ([[Emily Bergl]]), to also leave a message.  Saxon suffers a series of hallucinations and blackouts, advancing time quickly. In short time, he receives increasingly irritated calls from work, which he blows off; an abusive phone call from George Simian, followed by a physical altercation; and a visit by Sadie, concerned about his unexplained absences. Saxon declines to tell Sadie about his missing wife, instead telling her that his wife is visiting her mother. Sadie collapses in the bathroom, bloodying her nose, and complains of having heard a woman scream. Saxon explains that the neighbors, who fight often, can sometimes be heard from his house, and he gives her a change of clothes. After she leaves, Derm returns, wanting to search the house for clues. Sadie's bloody shirt is discovered by Derm, who seems satisfied with Saxon's explanation. Derm also finds a diary, which Saxon didn't know his wife kept. In it, Saxon's wife expresses mixed emotions for her husband, including pity, contempt, and fear. Despite his promise to give the diary to Derm, Saxon burns the diary.  Geoffrey Costas ([[Zach Grenier]]), a psychiatrist who leads a victim support group, visits Saxon, offering him comfort. Saxon initially declines, before soliciting stronger medication, to fight off long-term insomnia. Despite the strong medication, Saxon does not seem to fall asleep, though he suffers more blackouts and apparent hallucinations. Sadie returns to his house, concerned that he has missed more classes, but Susie interrupts them. Saxon angrily brushes aside Susie's concerns and explains that Sadie is just a student. After he gets rid of Susie, Sadie expresses her feelings of loneliness and isolation, as well as admiration for Saxon's poetry. This leads to an abortive tryst, which Saxon abruptly calls off. Humiliated and confused, Sadie leaves.  Derm calls Saxon to reveal that they've discovered his wife's body. Depressed, Saxon welcomes the chance to talk to Costas again. They discuss how traumatic events can lead to inappropriate guilt, and Costas convinces Saxon to allow him to speak to the police, on his behalf. However, the police reveal that they have not discovered the wife's body, after all, leading both Costas and Derm to suspect Saxon. Saxon has further hallucinations, leading him to suspect himself, as well. Simian, who had been arrested previously for assaulting Saxon, returns to Saxon's house again, enraged and seeking to kill Saxon. Saxon instead kills Simian, and, consumed with guilt, swallows every pill that he can find. Derm, arriving at the house afterward, kneels down, in front of Saxon, while Saxon denies killing anyone. The bathtub then overflows with blood, and Saxon sees his wife playing the piano.

He has made a mistake concerning her and he was remorseful and did everything in his power to penance for it, even marrying a rape victim - in order to give her a happy martial life which is otherwise denied to her. (Back then and even now, some people tend to think that if a women is raped then her life is done with- in regards to marriage and otherwise) Vamsi and his parents (indirectly) mention that Sivaji made an unintentional mistake under influence, for which he tried making amends but Seetha has made plenty of mistakes, knowingly and she has even caused turmoil to another lady's (Ganga) marriage. How is she any better and can't she really forgive Sivaji?  Seetha, concerned for her husband and regrettable of her actions, goes to Ganga's father and begs him to tell her about Sivaji's whereabouts, which he finally does. Sivaji lives in a humble lodgings in Vizag and works as a lorry driver. Ganga gets cured once she and Sivaji sleep together. Seetha reaches their place and ties a rakhi to Sivaji, proclaiming him as her brother and to save her husband, who had taken to writing Sivaji's name all over their bedroom wall in his blood. Sivaji rushes over to Hyderabad and his sheer proximity is enoughh for Vamsi to regain consciousness. The usual breakdown of sentimental feelings, pleas and forgiveness take place and they all live happily ever after.  
Chicken Run
  Mrs. Tweedy and Mr. Tweedy operate a meagre poultry farm in [[Yorkshire]]; the chickens are caged in the style of a [[World War II]] [[POW camp]] with a high fence and barbed wire, and two dogs patrol the grounds. (The opening parodies scenes from [[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]].) Any chicken that fails to produce enough eggs is slaughtered for food. Frustrated at the "minuscule profits" generated by the farm, Mrs. Tweedy conceives the idea of converting their farm into the automated production of chicken pot pies after seeing an ad in a magazine.  One chicken, Ginger, has long had visions of escaping with the help of her hen friends Babs, Bunty, and Mac, and two black-marketer rats, Nick and Fetcher, who help to acquire "contraband" from the Tweedys to aid Ginger's plans. However, she is always caught and put into solitary confinement. While thinking of a new plan, Ginger observes an American [[Rhode Island Red]] cockerel flying over the fence and crash into one of the coops, spraining his wing. Ginger and the other chickens help to hide him from the Tweedys and care for his wing, learning that his name is Rocky. Ginger is particularly interested in Rocky's ability to fly and begs him to help train her and the other chickens to do the same. Rocky is coy, but proceeds to try to help train the chickens, unable to fully demonstrate due to his sprained wing. Meanwhile, Mr. Tweedy begins assembling the production line, and the chicken's food ration is doubled in order to fatten them.  Amid the training, Rocky holds a large party to help relieve the stress; it is revealed his wing is healed, and Ginger insists he show them how to fly the next day. However, Mr. Tweedy completes the production line of a pie machine and immediately grabs Ginger for a test run. Rocky is able to save Ginger and helps to damage the machine, giving them time to warn the other chickens of the Tweedys' plan to make them into chicken pies and only a short time to plan their escape while Mr. Tweedy repairs the machine. The next day, Ginger finds Rocky has fled, leaving behind a part of a poster that shows him to be a stunt cockerel, shot out of a cannon from a nearby circus and unable to fly by himself. This makes Ginger and the other chickens depressed. Fowler the cockerel tries to cheer the chickens up by telling tales from his days as a [[Royal Air Force]] mascot, leading Ginger to the idea of creating a flying machine, called the Old Crate, to flee from the Tweedys' farm. All the chickens, with help from the rats, secretly assemble the required parts for the plane from their coops and the Tweedy's farm while racing against Mr. Tweedy's repairs. While travelling the countryside, Rocky sees a billboard for Mrs. Tweedy's Chicken Pies and is inspired to go back to help.  With the machine now fixed, Mrs. Tweedy insists that Mr. Tweedy gather all the chickens, but the chickens are ready to escape. They gag Mr. Tweedy and tie him up long enough to complete assembly of their plane. Just before they take off, Rocky returns and joins them. Whilst taking off, Mrs. Tweedy chases them down and grabs onto a Christmas light strand snagged in the wheels. Mrs. Tweedy climbs the strand with a hatchet, intent on decapitating Ginger, while Ginger races to sever the strand. Ginger manages to trick Mrs. Tweedy into cutting the strand, sending her straight into the safety valve of the pie machine and plugging it; pressure builds up and the machine explodes, destroying the barn. The chickens continue their flight to freedom, while Mr. Tweedy reminds his wife that he told her the chickens were organized. When she starts to growl in rage, Mr. Tweedy pushes the heavy metal door down onto her.  Months later, the chickens have found a quiet island where they can enjoy their freedom and raise their chicks, while Ginger and Rocky have developed a romantic relationship. Nick and Fetcher decide to start their own chicken farm for eggs, but disagree on whether to have [[Chicken or the egg|the chicken or the egg]] first.  
Cheaters (film)
  Students at [[Steinmetz High School]] are less than enthusiastic about anything in the classroom, except for Jolie Fitch, a junior who enjoys Dr. Jerry Plecki's English class and is involved heavily in all discussions, especially on his favorite book ''Paradise Lost''. Aside from teaching, Dr. Plecki is offered the position of Academic Decathlon coach, a job all the other teachers consider to be a waste of time for them as well as the students. Dr. Plecki holds an open call for the students after class, but no one arrives to participate. He is about to leave for the day when Jolie comes in and convinces him that he needs to look for the smarter students and recruit them. He succeeds in recruiting seven students (Darius, Matt, Paul, Dominik, Irwin, Agnieska, and Jolie). They spend the next few months studying hard for the regional competition.   On the day of competition, the team feels intimidated as they face their biggest competition: [[Whitney Young Magnet High School]]. The school has consistently won the regional and state competitions for almost a decade. At the end of the decathlon, as expected, Whitney Young is victorious and Steinmetz places 5th overall. Fortunately, any school that places in the top five moves on to the state competition. Overwhelmed with the anxiety of having to face Whitney Young in the next round, the students begin to feel that the whole decathlon is a waste of their time. However, an opportunity to cheat arises when Matt's friend steals a copy of the test for the state finals and gives it to him. Irwin then brings it to Dr. Plecki, who feels that using the test is the team's best chance to defeat Whitney Young at state.   After some persuasive discussion, all seven members agree to dismiss their conflicting feelings about cheating and begin reviewing the booklet, copying the answers on various items (calculators, shoes, a piece of gum, etc.). Dr. Plecki then takes Irwin out to the hall and explains that because he had the lowest scores in the group, he will be out of the state competition; however, he will be guaranteed a spot in nationals. Though Irwin is upset by the news, he agrees to go along with it.  On the day of the state finals, a much more confident Steinmetz meets Whitney Young again, with an opportunity to end their long winning streak. The Steinmetz team successfully gets through the exams with the answers they secretly wrote down and with Jolie coaching them in the Super Quiz. At the end of the day, Steinmetz is victorious and wins the state finals with an overall score of 49,000. Whitney Young is upset and suspicious about how Steinmetz could have improved their score so dramatically within such a short timeframe.   As the six members and Dr. Plecki celebrate their victory, a spiteful Irwin writes an essay, detailing how he feels betrayed by Dr. Plecki and how they received an advance copy of the test. Suspicions heighten when the essay is turned in to the principal, who questions Irwin about the truth of his essay. The Illinois Academic Decathlon board arrives at the school with news that the team will need to take a re-test to validate their scores, noting that their state score was nearly 10,000 points higher than their regional score. If they refuse, they will lose their title as champions. Feeling betrayed by Irwin and angered by the board's ultimatum, they refuse to take the re-test and plan to protect their title and reputation by seeking an injunction to halt the state from re-testing them.  As the media siege becomes more and more brutal, the Steinmetz team realizes they have no one to trust or confide in but themselves, knowing that if they are exposed, they will lose everything. Then a bombshell is dropped when Angela Lam, a student on the Academic Decathlon team from the year before, talks to the press about how she was given the answers to the Super Quiz in the state competition by Dr. Plecki.  She encourages the current team members to come clean if they cheated. Dr. Plecki is immediately suspended from his teaching duties and the team members are taken to the board of education headquarters where they are interrogated individually. Despite being pressured, they refuse to come clean and say they did not cheat. However, Dominik ultimately breaks and confesses that they did cheat after a heart to heart talk with one of the investigators.  As a result, the state title is stripped from Steinmetz and awarded to Whitney Young. Dr. Plecki is fired from Steinmetz High School, and the team members are harassed by the other students for ruining their reputation. Dr. Plecki decides to leave Chicago in hopes the media will go away and leave the team members alone. Before he leaves, he meets with his team one last time by Lake Michigan in downtown Chicago.  The students present him with a gift: John Milton's book ''Paradise Lost'' signed by the team and the gold medal in Language and Literature that they didn't return to the board. With the team disbanded and Dr. Plecki now gone, Jolie feels that she's lost a mentor that actually cared about her academic possibilities and her team that supported each other. In the end, Jolie gets accepted into college as the admissions board believed that her experience on the Academic Decathlon team allowed her to build character, and recognizes the merit of her achievements without cheating.  In the epilogue, it is stated that Dominik, Agneiska, and Paul went off to college, Matt worked in a warehouse, Darius' whereabouts are unknown, Irwin went to college to become a journalist, and Dr. Plecki started a business.  As a result of the 1995 cheating scandal, Steinmetz High School was banned from fielding an Academic Decathlon team for ten years. They returned to the competition in 2006.  
Cherry Falls
 In the woods outside of Cherry Falls, [[Virginia]], a teenage couple, Rod Harper ([[Jesse Bradford]]) and Stacy Twelfmann ([[Bre Blair]]) are getting romantic in a car when a black-haired female appears and murders them both. Meanwhile, in town, teenager Jody Marken ([[Brittany Murphy]]), the daughter of the local sheriff, is with her boyfriend, Kenny ([[Gabriel Mann]]), who thinks it is time to go "see other people." Jody goes back home to find her father, Brent ([[Michael Biehn]]), upset that she is out past her curfew. Brent and his deputies begin to investigate the [[murders]] the next day. They see that the killer carved the word "virgin" into both victims. At school, Brent sees English teacher Mr. Leonard Marliston ([[Jay Mohr]]), who urges him to divulge more details of the murder to students and the town so as to eliminate the possibility of secrets.  Annette Duwald, also a virgin, is killed in the same fashion of the last night's events. Concerned for the town's safety, Brent holds a meeting at the high school to tell parents the nature of the crimes. No students are invited, but Jody and her friend Timmy, who stayed after school, witness the meeting. Timmy asks to borrow Jody's [[cell phone]], and goes into the stairwell to make a call. Jody goes downstairs to find him, and discovers his dead body in a locker room. She is confronted by the killer who attacks her, but she manages to escape. At the police station, Jody describes the killer to an officer, who draws a composite. Brent confides with an old friend, Tom Sisler, (the current high school principal) that the suspect looks like "Lora Lee Sherman."  The two are both visibly nervous, and Jody listens in on their conversation.  Later at school, Jody and Kenny reconcile, and later Jody learns from her mother about the tale of Lora Lee. Twenty-five years ago, Lora Lee was a high school loner. She claimed that four popular boys at school, including Brent and the high school principal, raped her one night. Her cries fell on deaf ears and she left the city for the rural outskirts, where she was rarely seen or heard from again. After Jody discovers the truth, disappointed with the hypocrisy of her parents, she visits Kenny at his house. They talk, and Jody being upset with her parents, tries to pressure sex on Kenny. He refuses, pushing her away.  After catching news of the killer's targeting of virgins, the high school students in town congregate at an abandoned [[hunting lodge]] to indulge in a mass [[orgy]]. Brent goes to the school to meet Sisler only to find the principal dead in his office with the words "virgin not" carved into his forehead. Before Brent can react he is knocked out by the killer. Jody, who has refused to attend the orgy with Kenny, is out riding her bike when she cycles by Mr. Marliston's house and witnesses him dragging a heavy trunk inside. Suspicious, Jody sneaks into the house and opens the trunk. She recoils as she finds the beaten and bloody body of her unconscious father inside, before she too is knocked unconscious. At the orgy, Kenny is about to have sex with a girl when he has second thoughts and leaves to find Jody. He drives around trying to find her but is puzzled to see her bicycle outside of Marliston's house.  Downstairs in his house, Marliston puts on a wig and makeup to "become" Lora Lee Sherman. Marliston reveals that he is Lora Lee Sherman's illegitimate son, and asks Brent to retell the story of what happened that night 25 years ago. Brent reveals that the four boys, including himself, did indeed rape Lora Lee. Marliston says his mother became an abusive "psycho" after the rape and that one of the rapists is his father; there is an implication that Brent is in fact Marliston's biological father. By frightening virgins, Marliston anticipated a large high school orgy, which would thereby rob all the wealthy parents of their precious children's [[virginity]].  Kenny enters the house and frees Jody as Brent fights with Marliston, who manages to brutally kill him. Jody and Kenny flee to the orgy with Marliston in furious pursuit, killing a deputy en route. He bursts inside wielding an axe and mass panic erupts. After wildly stabbing panicking students and then trying to escape, Marliston fights both Jody and Kenny, with Kenny being severely wounded during the melee. Eventually, Marliston is pushed off a balcony by Jody and impaled on fence posts. At first he seems to be dead, before reviving briefly only to be promptly shot dead by Deputy Sheriff Mina, who unloads two pistols into him, ending his killing spree. The next day, Jody hides the reasons for the killings from the police and she and her mother head away from the station. As they leave town, Jody sees someone resembling Lora Lee Sherman disappear behind a moving school bus. The film ends with a shot of the waterfalls outside town, turning red.

Children of the Secret State
 The movie opens with a clip of orphan children by Ahn Chol and speaks of the humanitarian situation in the country, and then introduces Ahn Chol, who has provided the covertly filmed footage of the children.<ref name="gua"></ref> Joe Layburn, who also narrates the movie, and his camerawoman, Anna Roberts, are then introduced, on their way into [[Pyongyang]].

The movie shows the empty streets and unused fun fair and hotels, as well as the well cared-for 'children of the elite', whom he contrasts with footage of starving orphans filmed by Ahn Chol.  Layburn and Roberts then travel across the border to [[China]] to rendezvous with Ahn Chol and document the border and border town, using their own footage and interviews and the footage provided by Ahn Chol.<ref></ref> Ahn Chol, who planned to meet up with the couple at the border, fails to turn up, but Layburn proceeds to interview refugees who have fled into China from North Korea. He then heads for South Korea and makes more interviews. They also interview a man who has fled a factory complex, as well as a former North Korean prison guard. These interviews cover the well-guarded Chinese-North Korean border, the starvation in North Korea, and hostels where, according to Layburn and the children interviewed, (paraphrased) 'orphan children are deliberately left to die'.<ref name="gua"/>  He also states that the factories, and most industry, in the country have stopped running - this is later referred to by Layburn as (paraphrased) 'the crisis in the North Korean economy'.

Chopper (film)
 In and out of jail since he was 16, [[Melbourne]] [[extortion|standover man]] [[Mark "Chopper" Read|Mark Brandon "Chopper" Read]] ([[Eric Bana]]) is serving a 16-year sentence for kidnapping a supreme court judge to get his childhood friend, Jimmy Loughnan ([[Simon Lyndon]]), out of the notorious H Division of maximum security [[Pentridge Prison]]. To become leader of the division, he ignites a power struggle which gains him more enemies than admirers. Eventually, even his gang turn their backs on him and Loughnan stabs him several times in a failed assassination attempt. Chopper voluntarily has his ears cut off by a fellow inmate in order to be transferred out of the H Division; this also gains him recognition in and out of the prison.   He is released in 1986, revisiting enemies and friends whom he cannot differentiate anymore. He reunites with his former girlfriend Tanya ([[Kate Beahan]]), but suspects that she is involved with one of his old victims, Neville Bartos ([[Vince Colosimo]]). He tracks Bartos down, shoots him and takes him to the hospital, unabashedly claiming that he has a "green light" courtesy of the Police "to exterminate scum". When Chopper learns that he is now the target of a death-contract, he goes after his old friend Jimmy, only to find him worn out and poverty stricken by drugs with a daughter and a [[Substance dependence|junkie]] fiancée who is pregnant with another child.  He kills a criminal known as Siam "Sammy the Turk" Ozerkam at a bar, but gets away with it by claiming it was self-defence.

The film ends with Chopper in his prison cell in 1992, watching himself being interviewed on television. He is proud of the interview among those watching with him, but when they leave he goes quiet and the film ends with him sitting in his cell alone.  
Chocolat (2000 film)
 An unnamed female storyteller narrates the story of Vianne Rocher ([[Juliette Binoche]]), an expert [[chocolatier]] who drifts across Europe with her daughter Anouk ([[Victoire Thivisol]]), following the north wind. At the beginning of the Lenten season in 1959, "fifteen years after the War," they travel to a quiet French village that closely adheres to tradition, as dominated by the village mayor, the Comte de Reynaud ([[Alfred Molina]]). Just as the villagers begin observing the forty days of [[Lent]], Vianne opens a chocolate shop, much to Reynaud's displeasure.   Vianne wears more colorful clothing than the village women, is an atheist, and has an illegitimate child. She does not fit in well with the townspeople, but is nevertheless optimistic about her business. Her friendly and alluring nature begins to win the villagers over one by one, causing Reynaud to openly speak against her for tempting the people during a time of abstinence and self-denial. The Comte will not admit that his wife has left him; he is romantically interested in Caroline, but he does not pursue her.  One of the first to fall under the spell of Vianne and her confections is Armande ([[Judi Dench]]), her elderly, eccentric landlady. Armande is unhappy that her cold, devoutly pious daughter Caroline ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]) will not let Armande see her grandson Luc because Caroline thinks Armande is a "bad influence". Having lost her husband, Caroline is overly protective of Luc and does not even want her son to play. Vianne arranges for Luc and his grandmother to see each other in the chocolaterie, where they develop a close bond. Caroline later reveals to Vianne that her mother is a diabetic, though Armande continues to eat the chocolate despite her condition.    Vianne also develops a friendship with a troubled woman, Josephine ([[Lena Olin]]), who is a victim of brutal beatings by her abusive husband Serge ([[Peter Stormare]]). After her husband violently hits her and wounds her head, Josephine leaves him and moves in with Vianne and Anouk. As she begins to work at the chocolate shop and Vianne teaches her her craft, Josephine becomes a self-confident, changed woman. At the same time, under the instruction of Reynaud, Serge, having seemingly changed into a better man, asks Josephine to come back to him. Finally happy and fulfilled on her own, Josephine declines his request. A drunken Serge breaks into the chocolaterie later that night and attempts to attack both women, before Josephine, in a moment of empowerment, knocks him out with a skillet.  As the rivalry between Vianne and Reynaud intensifies, a band of river gypsies camp out on the outskirts of the village. While most of the town objects to their presence, Vianne embraces them, developing a mutual attraction to the [[Romani people|Traveller]] Roux ([[Johnny Depp]]). Together they hold a birthday party for Armande with other village members and gypsies on Roux's boat. When Caroline sees Luc, who sneaked out to the party, dancing with his grandmother, she begins to see how strict she has been with her son and that his grandmother's influence in his life may after all be beneficial. After the party, Josephine and Anouk fall asleep on a boat, while Roux and Vianne make love. Late that night, Serge sets fire to the boat where Josephine and Anouk are sleeping. Both escape unharmed, but Vianne's faith in the village is shaken. Luc helps Armande home from the party; her death soon after devastates both him and his mother. After the fire, Roux packs up and leaves with his group, much to Vianne's sadness.  Serge later visits Reynaud at his home to confess to setting the fire, which Reynaud initially thought was divine intervention: he is horrified at the thought of people almost getting killed as a result. Realizing that Serge is beyond help, and fearing that people would also blame him for the arson, Reynaud demands that Serge leave the village and never come back.  With the return of the North wind, Vianne decides that she cannot win against Reynaud or the strict traditions of the town. She decides to move elsewhere. Anouk refuses to go, and during a scuffle, an urn containing the ashes of Vianne's mother falls and shatters. After a moment, Vianne goes into her kitchen to see a group of townspeople, who have come to love her and the way she has changed their lives, making chocolate for the festival Vianne had planned for Easter Sunday. Realizing that she has brought change to the town, she decides to stay.  Despite the shifting sentiment in the town, Reynaud remains staunch in his abstinence from pleasures such as chocolate. On the Saturday evening before Easter, he sees Caroline leave the chocolaterie, which devastates him. Convinced now that chocolate will make people stray from their faith, he sneaks into Vianne's house in order to ruin her preparations for the Easter festival. After accidentally tasting a bit of chocolate that fell on his lips, he finally yields to temptation and devours much of the chocolate in the window display before collapsing into tears and eventually falling asleep. The next day, Vianne awakens the chastened mayor, a mutual respect between them is established, and Pere Henri improvises an inspiring sermon. Both the Easter Sunday sermon and the festival are a success, and the storyteller reveals that Reynaud and Caroline start a relationship half a year later. Josephine takes over running Serge's café, which she renames Café Armande. Vianne throws her mother's ashes out the window, which are carried away by the departing north wind.  The unseen storyteller concludes the story: Roux returns in the summer to be with Vianne, who despite her constant need for change resolves to stay, having found a home for herself and her daughter in the village; and her grown-up daughter Anouk herself is the storyteller.  
Chuck & Buck
 Buck O'Brien ([[Mike White (scriptwriter)|Mike White]]) is a 27-year-old amateur playwright with the maturity level of an adolescent. When Buck's mother dies unexpectedly, he invites his close childhood friend Chuck ([[Chris Weitz]]) to the funeral. Chuck (who is now calling himself "Charlie") is a successful music industry exec with a fiancée, Carlyn (Beth Colt). He and Buck experimented sexually with each other when they were 11, but Charlie has repressed these memories and acts as if they had not occurred. Chuck had moved away while they were still children, and Buck has pined after him ever since. During their awkward reunion, Buck makes a sexual advance on Charlie in the bathroom. Charlie rebuffs him, and returns to [[Los Angeles]] with Carlyn, but not before extending an obligatory invitation for Buck to visit him there. Buck then withdraws $10,000 from his bank account, packs up his car, and takes up residence in a motel in [[Los Angeles]]. He also begins scripting a play on a yellow legal pad: titled "Hank and Frank and the Witch", it is an obvious plea for Charlie's love.  Too shy to announce his presence right away, Buck starts trying to see Charlie at his office at Trimorph Entertainment. Buck also surreptitiously follows Charlie to find out where he lives. While standing in front of the playhouse across the street from Charlie's job, he strikes up a conversation with Beverly ([[Lupe Ontiveros]]), the house manager. Buck hires Beverly to produce his play, and casts Sam ([[Paul Weitz (filmmaker)|Paul Weitz]]), a talentless actor who bears a strong resemblance to Charlie, in the lead. Buck then works up the nerve to approach Charlie and his girlfriend. After being invited to a party that Charlie and Carlyn host, Buck becomes aware of just how far apart he and Chuck have grown; he feels rejected by Charlie's new friends. He also becomes resentful of Carlyn, who he erroneously believes is interfering with their friendship. As a result of this mind-set, Buck's behavior becomes increasingly erratic and obsessive.  The end of the film deals with both Chuck and Buck confronting each other over their past. The two have sex, and Buck wants Charlie to stay afterward, but Charlie says they must part ways. Buck is distraught afterward, but eventually realizes he has found a new life at the playhouse.  When discussing a play over dinner with Beverly, Buck notices Charlie has arrived with Carlyn.  Charlie and Buck exchange glances across the room, but Buck ultimately disregards them and goes back to his conversation. Buck comes to the theater to find an invitation to the wedding. Buck arrives at the wedding party and offers the couple his blessing with his presence. Buck and Carlyn make peace as Buck effectively moves on from his obsession with Charlie and keeping their sexual encounter a secret from Carlyn.

Worrying that her in-laws will force their son to divorce her daughter, she tells another daughter to call her uncles.  At the phone booth, she passes by three young women, including Arezou and Nargess, who have just escaped prison. The three of them are trying to come up with money so that they can go to Nargess's home village. The third prisoner is immediately arrested, as she tries to pawn a gold chain, leaving just the two women. Nargess spots what she thinks is a landscape-painting of her hometown at a nearby shop and describes to Arezou the paradise awaiting them at the end of their bus journey. Arezou in the meantime finds enough money from an acquaintance to get Nargess a bus ticket, deciding not to go herself. The two of them separate.   At the bus station, however, Nargess can't get on the bus, because it is being searched by the police, and she is afraid that she will be arrested again. Instead she tries to find another prisoner, Pari, who also snuck out of the prison that day. Pari's father will not let her in the house, however, and just as Nargess leaves, Pari's two brothers arrive, and angrily force their way into the house, in order to "talk" to their sister. Pari manages to escape, and eventually makes her way to a hospital where she finds Elham, another former prisoner who has hidden her past and is now a nurse, married to a doctor.  From her conversation with Elham, we learn that Pari is pregnant, but the father of her baby has been executed, and she has no one to approve her having an abortion. Elham, concerned about arousing suspicions about her own past, is reluctant to do anything to help her, so Pari is left to wander the streets at night. Without ID, she cannot get into a hotel. At a street corner, she finds a mother trying to abandon her little girl, hoping that she will find a better life with a family. She continues wandering the street.  The mother is caught by an undercover police officer who thinks she is a prostitute, but she later manages to escape. Then, another woman who has been picked up as a prostitute is taken to prison. She is placed in a cell with other women we met so far in the film, and the phone rings outside the metal door.

The Claim
 Daniel Dillon is an [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrant who settles in the high mountains of [[California]] during the Gold Rush of 1849. It is now 1867, and Dillon has a vault filled with gold and a town of his own, named Kingdom Come. Dillon owns nearly every business of consequence in the town; if someone digs for gold, rents a hotel room, opens a bank account, or commits a crime, they will have to deal with Dillon.  One of the few profitable enterprises in town that Dillon does not own is the saloon/brothel, which is operated by Lucia, his [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] lover.  Donald Dalglish is a [[surveying|surveyor]] with the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], which wants to put a train either through Kingdom Come, or somewhere in the vicinity. He is here to decide the route. Dillon is anxious to ensure that the railway line is routed through "his" town, as this will bring more business.  Among the travelers who arrive in town with Dalglish are two women, the beautiful but ailing Elena Burn and her lovely teenage daughter Hope. The presence of these women is deeply troubling for Dillon, for they are the keys to a dark secret Dillon has kept from the people of Kingdom Come for nearly twenty years. Dillon had come to these mountains with his [[Poles|Polish]] wife Elena and their months-old baby, Hope. On a cold and snowy night they happen upon a shack named Kingdom Come, owned by a disillusioned [[Californian Gold Rush#Forty-niners|'49er]] named Burn. Like Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge, Dillon sells Elena and Hope to the prospector in exchange for the small gold claim that would later flourish and make Dillon so wealthy. Burn has died, and Elena has come to find Dillon because Burn left her with nothing, she is dying, and she wants Dillon to give her $200 per year so that she can "do right by Hope".  Dillon tells Lucia that they have to end their relationship and gives her some gold bricks and the deeds to her home, the saloon/brothel, and the tobacco house. Lucia is heartbroken, wanting Dillon and not his money. Dillon tells Elena that he never married anyone else because he was always married to her. The two renew their marriage but their time together is short, filled with Dillon's efforts to find a cure for her illness and ending with her death.  Elena's death coincides with the decision to route the railway some distance from the town for easier passage and construction. Lucia moves the girls, the booze and the tobacco house to the valley, effectively moving the entire population of Kingdom Come to her new town of [[Lisbon|Lisboa]], named for her father's home in Portugal, to be near the railroad. Following Elena's funeral, Hope tells Dillon that she is leaving to find Dalglish and start a life with him. Dillon takes her up to the original shack Kingdom Come, showing her a picture of their family when she was a baby, and revealing the deal made right on that spot between him and Burn. Hope leaves him and goes to the new Lisboa.  Dillon is thus faced with the loss of both Elena and Hope, and his town. He sets fire to all the buildings in Kingdom Come. The smoke attracts the people of Lisboa, who find Dillon's frozen body in the snow near his original shack. Lucia is devastated, crying over the frozen body as it is brought back to the ruins of Kingdom Come. While many of the 'former' townspeople rush to find Dillon's stockpile of gold in the burned out vault, Hope and Dalglish choose instead to follow Dillon's body as Lucia and others continue with it down the mountain.  
The Color of Friendship
 In 1977, [[Piper Dellums]] ([[Shadia Simmons]]) is a black girl who lives in [[Washington, D.C.]] with her father, Congressman [[Ron Dellums]] ([[Carl Lumbly]]), an outspoken opponent of the South African [[apartheid]] system and the oppression of black South Africans, her mother Roscoe Dellums ([[Penny Johnson Jerald|Penny Johnson]]), and two younger twin brothers, Brandon (Anthony Burnett) and [[Erik Dellums|Erik]] (Travis Davis). Piper, who has been taking an interest in the different nations of Africa, begs her parents to host an African exchange student.  Meanwhile, in South Africa, Mahree Bok ([[Lindsey Haun]]) is a [[white South African]] who lives in a [[manor]] house with her parents and little brother. They comfortably benefit from the system of [[apartheid]] without questioning its morality; Mahree's father, Pieter Bok, is a South African [[policeman]] who cannot hide his joy when [[Steve Biko]] (a black South African man fighting against apartheid) has just been captured. They also have a black [[maid]], Flora ([[Melanie Nicholls-King]]), whom Mahree, in her racial blindness, considers her best friend, not realizing that Flora is not satisfied with her life under [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]]. However, Mahree's observation is not entirely wrong, as Flora is a kindly woman who is indeed friendly with the Bok children, believing that gentleness and persuasion work better than agitation. Flora tells Mahree that when she was a little girl she would observe the weaver bird, which has many different styles of plumage, and its communal nest-building, which is used as a metaphor for the possibility of racial harmony that Mahree does not understand at the time. Mahree also asks her parents for permission to study in America, which is granted by her father, who believes she will either get homesick or realize that America is not a paradise. However, Mahree is slightly aware of some of the injustices of her society, as a black busboy gets slugged for spilling a tray, which she finds revolting.  Both Mahree and Piper have misconstrued notions about each other's countries: Mahree does not think that there are black politicians, only knowing the patriarch of her host family is "Congressman Dellums", and although Piper is expecting a South African exchange student, she does not realize there are white residents.  Their assumptions are not corrected until Piper and her mother meet Mahree at the airport and bring her home. Piper is bitterly disappointed. Mahree reacts with horror bordering on panic when confronted with this new situation, as does Ron. Piper goes to his office where he is meeting with several black Congressmen, and they all look surprised to see that he will be hosting a white South African.  Once Mahree gets back to the Dellums' house, she locks herself in Piper's bedroom and refuses to come out.  Eventually, Piper picks the lock on the door to bring Mahree some fries and a chocolate shake. Mahree is standoffish, and Piper, upset by her attitude, tells Mahree how disappointed she is in her. Stunned by this, Mahree sees how rude she's been, and agrees to stay and try to make this work. Roscoe tries to play peacemaker, chalking up Mahree's reaction to misunderstanding and culture shock, while telling Ron and Piper they have been judgmental as well. Everyone tries to make this work out.  During Mahree's stay, she and the Dellumses grow close. Mahree sees people of different races getting along and realizes how much she and Piper have in common. The two become good friends. Mahree also begins to see her host family as individuals and learns to live among them day to day. Gradually, she develops a better understanding of what life under South African apartheid must be like for people of color.  When Steve Biko dies under suspicious circumstances in the custody of South African police, there are mass protests around the world, including at the South African embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]]  In the wake of these protests, South African embassy diplomats arrive at the Dellums' house and take Mahree to the embassy, intending to send her back to South Africa.  In response, Ron goes to the South African embassy.  After he threatens to tell the press that the embassy kidnapped Mahree from her host family, the embassy releases Mahree. Mahree returns to the Dellumses without fully understanding what happened to her and why.  When Mahree returns to the Dellums' house, she makes a cold offhand comment about Biko's death.  Outraged, Piper shouts at her for being blind to the racial struggle happening in South Africa. Hurt, Mahree runs from the house. At first, it seems that their friendship is over; but Piper's parents soon bridge the gap between the girls. In private, Ron tells Mahree that the United States had a long, hard history of trying to overcome problems, which is what South Africa is doing now, and she finally fully grasps what the liberation fighters in South Africa stand for. She and Piper reconcile.  Soon, Mahree leaves the United States, now a very different person. When she returns home, the first person she greets is Flora.  Secretly, Mahree shows her an [[African National Congress|ANC]] flag sewn inside her coat, signifying her decision to side with the black liberation movement. Flora is touched and pleased.  An epilogue-like scene at the end of the movie shows Mahree with the Dellumses at an African pride event back in America. Ron Dellums delivers a speech that includes the weaver-bird story, as told to him by "a new friend from South Africa."

She replies of course she was and recalls specifics of the scene to Camille after he doubts her answer.  After spending an afternoon in the park with  Hélène, Camille demands that he be brought home, to his true home. Confused and upset, Ariane wonders what he means and consults with  Hélène, who insists everything was normal until she arrived. Ariana takes Camille home.  After demanding further, Camille insists that he be brought home, to his true mother, and that this lie has gone on far enough. Skeptical, Ariane takes him to the home that Camille brings them to. He Ariane knock on the front door and the caretaker of the apartment, Laurence, opens the door. Ariane says she and the owner are old friends who lost touch, and that she is dizzy and needs to take a rest inside. Laurence lets them in and Camille runs off into a bedroom with pictures of young boy across the wall. Laurence reveals, although supposedly Ariane and Camille know this already, that the young boy on the wall drowned years before, and was the owner, Isabella's, son. Ariane, at that point, insists that Camille and she go home, however Camille refuses. Ariane asks for Laurence to phone for a taxi, and she and Camille go home.  Once at home, Camille refers to Ariane by her name, and not as "mommy" like he previously did. Ariane and Serge become worried, but indulge with Camille as he is their son. Ariane decides to take Camille back to Camille's "real home" the next day. When they arrive, Isabella is there and she and Camille seem to bond, with Camille revealing that his true name is Paul, the name of the dead son of Isabella. Isabella and "Paul" unite, excluding Ariane. Camille insist that Ariane spend the night with them, as she has been good to him. Ariane, not wishing to abandon her child, agrees.  The next day, Ariane, Isabella, and Camille go back to Ariane's house. Isabella is careful not to abandon Ariane too soon, but Isabella is keen on possessing Camille as her son. Once at the house, Camille continues referring to Isabella as "mommy" and Ariane by her name. Serge sits in a room alone with Camille and demands for him to understand that his name is Camille and that Ariane is his true mother. Camille does not agree, and runs away.  Ariane, Isabella, and Serge chase after him, searching. Ariane thinks to herself with anger towards Isabella and vows to not let her steal the child from her. Then, feeling lightheaded, she confronts Isabella and asks her to move in with them, as she does not want to leave Camille. Ariane says that Isabella has won.  Isabella moves her things into the large home, revealing that she has no family of her own until her "son" arrived. She is happy to move in. The next day, Camille is told by his uncle that his mother, Isabella, is waiting downstairs and that they have to leave. He complies. Camille is driven off by his uncle before Isabella arrives. When Isabella arrives, Serge's secretary is waiting with a car to drive her to a hospital, where supposedly Camille is. Once they arrive, Isabella notices that this is a mental institution. She is confronted by Serge and demands to leave, while Serge says the only way she can leave is if she is admitted to the hospital. Serge insists that they run tests on her.  Meanwhile, Ariane receives a phone call from the uncle that Camille has been dropped off, yet she cannot find him. She eventually does see him in the outside yard and has a conversation with him that Isabella ran off, leaving him alone. Camille refuses to believe her and calls her a liar. Ariane reports to Serge that the conversation did not go well.  Later, in the rain, Camille runs off again, while Isabella is no where to be found at the hospital, much to Serge's anger. Isabella is confronted in her house by Alexandre, a boy who she thought was imaginary. He reveals that he knows something is troubling, as Camille has not been to their appointments in two days, whereas he previously never missed one. Alexandre reveals that Camille had been followed by hallucinations that Alexandre believed was due to a poor diet. Alexandre reveals that Camille believed the ghost named Paul was following him. Alexandre then gives Ariane the possessions that he was told to give her by Camille if he were ever in trouble. Then, Alexandre leaves out the window, which was the way that Camille used to leave the house to meet him.  Isabella finds cassette tapes from Camille's camera with  Hélène and they begin watching footage of Isabella attempting to convince an ambivalent Camille that his name is Paul and that he is her son. They are standing on the ledge that Isabella's son fell from and drowned, and she makes a point to tell Camille that this is where he fell. Ariane then, to her knowledge, understands what happened. She is upset that  Hélène would have left him alone, yet  Hélène insists she never let Camille out of her sight. Isabella phones Serge and they drive to the ledge together. Once there, they wait to see what happens so as not to overwhelm Camille.  The next morning, Isabella reveals herself, and is about to enter a taxi at the ledge with Camille when she is confronted by Ariane and Serge. Camille runs to Ariane and calls her "mommy".  Isabella goes home with Ariane, who promises not to reveal the cassette tapes. Isabella insists it is not her fault and that she loves Ariane, who does not believe her. Isabella argues that it was Camille whose fault it was. Ariane leaves her in the room, when she hears Camille calling for her.  Ariane tells a skeptical Hélène that she will watch more of the cassette tapes. As Ariane watches, she sees a scene of Camille questioning Ariane as his true mother, and that Isabella must be his true mother. Isabella, on the tape, has longer hair and refuses to be Camille's mother at first, until she is swayed by Camille and skips off, holding the air as if there were an invisible hand.  The film ends with a shot of a painting on the wall in Ariane's house. There were repetitive instances of shots of the paintings and artwork on the walls throughout the film.

The Contender (2000 film)
 Second-term [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] Jackson Evans must select a new [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] following the sudden death of his previous vice president. The obvious choice seems to be [[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] Jack Hathaway, who is hailed as a hero after he recently dove into a lake in a failed attempt to save a drowning girl. The President instead decides that his "[[swan song]]" will be helping to break the [[glass ceiling]] by nominating Laine Hanson, a talented Democratic senator from [[Ohio]]. In accordance with the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment to the Constitution]], approval from both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]] is required. Standing in her way is [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] Congressman Sheldon Runyon of [[Illinois]], who believes she is unqualified for the position, and backs Hathaway for the nod. His investigation into her background turns up an incident where she was apparently photographed participating in a drunken [[orgy]] as part of a [[sorority]] initiation. He is joined in his opposition by Democratic Representative Reginald Webster.  The confirmation hearings begin in [[Washington, D.C.]], and Runyon, who chairs the committee, quickly addresses Hanson's alleged sexual imbroglio. Hanson refuses to address the incident, neither confirming nor denying anything, and tries to turn the discussion towards political issues. Anticipating that Hanson would deem her personal past "none of anyone's business," Runyon starts rumors in the media saying that the sexual escapade in college was done in exchange for money and favors, making it [[prostitution]].  Hanson meets with Evans and offers to withdraw her name, to save his administration more embarrassment. Despite the wishes of the administration, she refuses to fight back or even address Runyon's charges, arguing that to answer the questions dignifies them being asked in the first place—something she does not believe. Evans meets with Runyon, informing him he will not choose Hanson as Vice President. Runyon casually brings forward Hathaway as a replacement. They make an agreement that Runyon will back down on his attacks if Evans chooses Hathaway as Vice President. However, Evans requests Runyon to make a public statement defending Hathaway.  Hanson, Hathaway and Runyon are all invited to the [[White House]]. Evans then shocks them by showing a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] report that proves Hathaway paid the woman to drive off the bridge into the lake, part of a plan to increase his approval ratings and become the obvious choice for Vice President. Hathaway is arrested and Runyon is disgraced because he vouched for Hathaway's integrity just hours earlier. Evans meets with Hanson, and she finally tells what actually happened that night in college. She said that she did indeed arrive at a [[fraternity]] house to have sex with two men as part of an [[initiation]], but changed her mind before any sex occurred. However, she did not prove her innocence, citing that by doing so will further the idea that it was acceptable to ask the questions in the first place. Evans addresses Congress, where he chastises all Democrats and Republicans who blocked Hanson's confirmation. He explicitly calls out Runyon, who leaves in humiliation. Although he declares that Hanson had asked for her nomination to be withdrawn so he could finish his presidency with triumph over controversy, he remains adamant and calls for an immediate confirmation vote. Congress applauds.  
Cord (film)
 After struggling with infertility, Anne (Daryl Hannah) finally succeeds in getting pregnant through [[invitro fertilization]] with her husband Jack (Bruce Greenwood). However, one night, Anne awakens to discover a masked intruder in her room. Terrified, Anne tries to escape, but the intruder chloroforms her into unconsciousness, rendering her helpless as he kidnaps her and takes her to an isolated house.  In the morning, Anne finds herself held captive by a couple named Frank (Vincent Gallo) and Helen (Jennifer Tilly). Helen has gone mad after her baby was aborted by Frank upon learning that it would have been born deformed. The procedure left her sterile, and he is now attempting to make it up to her by giving her Anne's baby. Anne recognizes Frank as a technician at her fertility clinic, and Helen later tells her that he secretly replaced her fertilized egg with one of Helen's instead. Frank stages a car accident with a horribly burned body to make everyone believe Anne is dead; Jack refuses to accept it and pressures the [[police]] to continue investigating, but after several months they dismiss his ideas.  After dealing with several escape attempts, Frank finds himself frustrated both with Helen's bipolar insanity and her refusal to have sex with him while she is "pregnant", and he attempts to force himself on Anne before being interrupted by Helen. Frank chases Anne outdoors while Helen terrorizes a [[diaper]] service saleswoman. Subsequently  Frank attempts a forcible [[amniocentesis]], against Helen's wishes, and during the argument he lets it slip that he never switched her eggs. Helen snaps and kills and cooks Frank's body. Her increasing madness leads her to threaten Anne with a [[caesarean section]], and Anne finally manages to escape. She calls Jack from a nearby [[phone booth]], but Helen runs it down with her truck in the middle of the call. Although she chases and shoots at Anne, Anne cuts her face with broken glass and runs, collapsing on the roadside where she is found by a local teenager.  The police still refuse to believe Jack's story, even after seeing the damage to the phone booth, so Jack travels to the house Anne described, only to be ambushed by Helen with a [[baseball bat]]. Helen then kills a [[nurse]] at the hospital and again kidnaps Anne to force her into having the baby. Helen decides to allow her to have a natural birth rather than a C-section, but Anne manages to break free, and after a violent struggle she wraps one of her chains around Helen's neck and strangles her. Helen rises up for one final shot but misses and dies. As the police take Helen's body away, Anne emerges from the house with Jack and her new baby.

County Kilburn

The Convent (2000 film)
 The film opens with a young Christine (Oakley Stevenson) breaking into a convent and systematically killing each and every nun she comes across before setting fire to the place and leaving. The scene then cuts to modern day, where it's established that the convent has since been abandoned and is a popular place for local college students to break in and vandalize, as it's reported to be haunted. It's particularly popular for sororities and fraternities to break in and try to spray paint their letters on the bell tower, which is where Clorissa ([[Joanna Canton]]) is headed that very night with her friends. She's joined by her old goth friend Mo ([[Megahn Perry]]), her nerdy brother Brant ([[Liam Kyle Sullivan]]), ex-fraternity brother Frijole (Richard Trapp), the cheerleader Kaitlin (Renée Graham) and her dog, and fraternity brothers Chad (Dax Miller) and Biff (Jim Golden).  At the convent Biff and Frijole immediately start bullying Brant under the pretense that it is just routine [[hazing]] that all must go through in order to join the fraternity. This irritates Clorissa, who unsuccessfully tries to convince Brant that he should blow them off. Once inside, the group begins to explore the convent but are stopped by the arrival of two police officers ([[Coolio]] and [[Bill Moseley]]) that force them to leave and take a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]] that one of them had been holding. Only Mo has managed to remain within the convent, as she had persuaded Frijole to cover for her by telling him that she was a virgin and that she'd let him have sex with her. The group then goes to a [[Denny's]], where Frijole tells the group that they must go back for Mo as well as a large stash of pot that he left in the convent.  Back in the convent, Mo has been grabbed by a group of [[Satanists]] that are intent on sacrificing her as part of a ritual to give its leader Saul ([[David Gunn (actor)|David Gunn]]) power and summon [[Satan]] to earth. As Mo listens to the group talk to one another, she realizes that while they are all ridiculously gothic pretentious and have no idea what they are doing, they are serious about killing her. She tries to talk them out of it but is ultimately unsuccessful. After she is stabbed in the heart by one of the Satanists, Mo is immediately possessed by one of the demons that were already inhabiting the convent and begins slaying everyone in the group except Saul and Dickie-Boy ([[Kelly Mantle]]), who manage to get away. Meanwhile, the others have returned to the convent where they are also murdered one by one, until only Clorissa and Brant remain. Saul kidnaps Brant in the hopes of sacrificing him to Satan and sending the demons back, but Brant manages to escape and Saul is quickly killed and converted by the demons. Brant doesn't get far, as he and Dickie-Boy then get taken by the demons with the intent to use them in a sacrifice.  Clorissa makes her way to the convent and flees to the house of a now grown Christine ([[Adrienne Barbeau]]), who tells her the full story of the convent, which also served as an orphanage and home for pregnant teens. Christine admits that she did attack the nuns and priest running the place, but it was because they had become possessed by demons and were intent on taking her baby and using him to create the [[Anti-Christ]]. She saved her son, but had to spend years in a mental institution as a result. Christine then goes on to say that every few years college students break into the convent and become possessed by demons, but that little comes of it because she managed to fight them off and because none of them were virgins (meaning that Mo's claims of virginity were false), as only a virgin can become the Anti-Christ. Upon hearing that Brant is a virgin, Christine and Clorissa return to the convent to fight. They manage to fight off most of the demons but are unable to stop them from killing Dickie-Boy (who was also a virgin), who becomes the Anti-Christ. Christine then urges Clorissa and Brant to flee, as she will blow up the convent with herself and the Anti-Christ inside, as it is the only way to ensure that it will not escape. Clorissa and Brant escape the convent and find that the only other survivor is Kaitlin's dog, which Clorissa takes home with her. Once at home, Clorissa lays down on her bed to digest everything that happened and is promptly attacked by the dog, as it was also possessed by one of the demons.

Coyote Ugly (film)
 Violet Sanford leaves her hometown of [[South Amboy, New Jersey]], her father Bill, and her best friend Gloria, in order to pursue her dreams of becoming a songwriter in nearby New York City. Violet tries multiple times to get her [[demo tape]] noticed by the recording studios but is unsuccessful. One night, she tries to get herself noticed by a music industry scout. The [[bartender]] jokingly points out Kevin O'Donnell, making her believe that he is the bar owner. When she discovers the joke, Violet feels hurt because she thinks Kevin was trying to make her look foolish. With only a few dollars left in her pocket after her apartment is robbed, she goes to an all-night diner and notices three girls, Cammie, Rachel, and Zoe, flaunting the hundreds of dollars in tips they earned. After inquiring, she finds out that they work at a trendy bar named Coyote Ugly.  She finds her way to the bar and convinces the bar owner Lil to give her an audition. Violet's first audition does not go well; but after Violet breaks up a fight between two customers, Lil gives her a second audition. At her second audition, Violet douses the fire warden in water which costs Lil $250. However, Lil decides she can work at the bar if she can make up $250 in one night. Kevin turns up at the bar, and Violet auctions him off to another woman at the bar to earn the money. Kevin tells Violet that he owes her, so Violet agrees to go on four dates with him. The two begin a relationship.  Kevin commits himself to helping Violet overcome her stage fright, which she is informed she'll have to do to have her songs heard. Violet tells Kevin she inherited her stage fright from her now deceased mother, who also moved to New York in her youth to pursue her dreams of singing. Violet's stage fright mostly extends to singing her original pieces, as she sings in the bar to help Cammie and Rachel, who are trying to break up a fight between customers.  One night, a patron takes a picture of Violet in the middle of a raunchy move with water pouring on her. When the picture appears in the paper, her dad Bill sees it and gets angry at her. She keeps the job despite her dad's wishes, but shortly thereafter gets fired when Kevin gets into a fight at the bar. She and Kevin then break up. With her dreams not working and her job at the bar terminated, Violet goes to New Jersey for Gloria's wedding. Bill gets into a car accident which almost prompts Violet to move back to New Jersey, but Bill convinces her not to give up while telling her the truth that her Mother didn't actually have a problem with stage-fright and quit singing because of Bill.  Back in New York Lil visits her at a restaurant she's now working at and the two make amends. Violet finishes a new song and later performs it at an open mic night at the [[Bowery Ballroom]] with the Coyotes from the Coyote Ugly saloon, Bill, Gloria, and Kevin all there for moral support. The performance leads to a deal with a record label. The film concludes back at Coyote Ugly with [[LeAnn Rimes]], having recorded Violet's song, singing on the bar as Violet joins in and Violet kissing Kevin celebrating her dream coming true.  
The Crew (2000 film)
 Four retired mobsters Bobby ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]) - the straight man leader, Bats ([[Burt Reynolds]]) - a cantankerous man with a short fuse and a pacemaker, Mouth ([[Seymour Cassel]]) - a silent ladies man many years past his prime, and Brick ([[Dan Hedaya]]) - a nice but dimwitted man plan one last crime to save their apartment at a retirement home (the owners are forcing them out with a rent increase so that the apartments can be rented to young, affluent [[South Beach]] couples).  The four steal a corpse from the mortuary to use as the "victim" in a staged murder scene.  Unknown to them, the body was that of Luis Ventanna, the head of a Colombian drug smuggling ring. As a result of the "murder", many of the young renters leave and the four men are given cash and a rent discount by the complex to keep living there.  Much of this money is spent on high living and women, which causes a young stripper, Ferris ([[Jennifer Tilly]]) to discover that the four men staged the murder - while spending time with the normally-silent "Mouth," he reveals that his mouth is loosened by intimacy with women.  To keep the woman quiet, the four agree to kill her stepmother ([[Lainie Kazan]]), but instead kidnap her and fake her death by setting fire to her mansion.  In the process, they accidentally burn down the house of the drug-smuggler's son ([[Miguel Sandoval]]), who happened to live in a nearby mansion.  Believing that someone is trying to usurp his power, the drug lord offers $100,000 to anyone who brings him the head of the man responsible.  This results in a confrontation at the apartment, leading to the capture of a female police officer and her partner ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]] and [[Jeremy Piven]]), one of the wiseguys ([[Seymour Cassel]]), the young woman, and the stepmother. The other wiseguys manage to escape this conflict, and track down the men who kidnapped their friend.  They call in all of their still-living former associates from their active years and lay siege to the ship where the drug lord is holding his prisoners.  They then turn the ship and the drug smugglers over to the police, along with a shipment of drugs.  A truckload of [[Cuban cigars#Cuban cigars|Cuban cigars]] is taken by the men and used to make their apartment complex into "a retirement home for old wiseguys who are down on their luck."  A sub-plot of the movie involves [[Richard Dreyfuss]]' search for his long lost daughter ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]), whom he hasn't seen since he was in his 30s and she was a small child.

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
 The film is set in 18th century [[Qing Dynasty]] China. Li Mu Bai ([[Chow Yun-fat]]) is an accomplished [[Wudang Sect|Wudang]] swordsman and Yu Shu Lien ([[Michelle Yeoh]]) heads a private security company. Yu Shu Lien and Li Mu Bai have feelings for each other, but because Shu Lien had been engaged to Mu Bai's closest friend, Meng Sizhao,<ref name="YenMovieRol"></ref> before his death, Shu Lien and Mu Bai feel bound by loyalty to Meng Sizhao and have not acted on their feelings for one another. Mu Bai, after choosing to retire, asks Shu Lien to give his sword "Green Destiny" to their benefactor Sir Te ([[Sihung Lung]]) in [[Beijing]]. Long ago, Mu Bai's master was murdered by Jade Fox ([[Cheng Pei-pei]]), a woman who sought to learn Wudang skills. While at Sir Te's place, Shu Lien makes the acquaintance of Jen Yu ([[Zhang Ziyi]]), who is the daughter of a rich and powerful Governor Yu and is about to get married.  One evening, a masked thief sneaks into Sir Te's estate and steals the Green Destiny. Mu Bai and Shu Lien trace the theft to Governor Yu's compound, where Jade Fox had been posing as Jen's governess for many years. Mu Bai makes the acquaintance of Inspector Tsai (Wang Deming), a police investigator from the provinces, and his daughter May (Li Li), who have come to Peking in pursuit of Fox. Fox challenges the pair and Sir Te's servant Master Bo (Gao Xi'an) to a showdown that night. Following a protracted battle, the group is on the verge of defeat when Mu Bai arrives and outmaneuvers Fox. Before Mu Bai can kill Fox, the masked thief reappears and helps Fox. Fox kills Tsai before fleeing with the thief (who is revealed to be Jen). After seeing Jen fight Mu Bai, Fox realizes Jen had been secretly studying the Wudang manual and may have surpassed her in combat skills.  At night, a desert bandit named Lo ([[Chang Chen]]) breaks into Jen's bedroom and asks her to leave with him. A [[flashback (continuity)|flashback]] reveals that in the past, when Governor Yu and his family were traveling in the western deserts, Lo and his bandits had raided Jen's caravan and Lo had stolen her comb. She pursued him to his desert cave to get her comb back. However, the pair soon fell passionately in love. Lo eventually convinced Jen to return to her family, though not before telling her a legend of a man who jumped off a cliff to make his wishes come true. Because the man's heart was pure, he did not die. Lo came to Beijing to persuade Jen not to go through with her arranged marriage.  However, Jen refuses to leave with him. Later, Lo interrupts Jen's wedding procession, begging her to leave with him. Nearby, Shu Lien and Mu Bai convince Lo to wait for Jen at [[Wudang Mountains|Mount Wudang]], where he will be safe from Jen's family, who are furious with him. Jen runs away from her husband on their wedding night before the marriage could be consummated. Disguised in male clothing, she is accosted at an inn by a large group of warriors; armed with the Green Destiny and her own superior combat skills, she emerges victorious.  Jen visits Shu Lien, who tells her that Lo is waiting for her at Mount Wudang. After an angry exchange, the two women engage in a duel. Shu Lien is the superior fighter, but Jen wields the Green Destiny: the sword destroys each weapon that Shu Lien wields, until Shu Lien finally manages to defeat Jen with a broken sword.  When Shu Lien shows mercy, Jen cuts Shu Lien's arm.  Mu Bai arrives and pursues Jen into a bamboo forest. Mu Bai confronts Jen and offers to take her as his student. She arrogantly promises to accept him as her teacher if he can take Green Destiny from her in three moves.  Mu Bai is able to take the sword in only one move, but Jen goes back on her word and flees. Mu Bai decides to throw the sword over a waterfall. Jen dives into an adjoining river to retrieve the sword and is then rescued by Fox. Fox puts Jen into a drugged sleep and places her in a cavern; Mu Bai and Shu Lien discover her there. Fox suddenly reappears and attacks the others with poisoned darts. Mu Bai blocks the needles with his sword and avenges his master's death by mortally wounding Fox, only to realize that one of the darts hit him in the neck. Fox dies, confessing that her goal had been to kill Jen because Jen had hidden the secrets of Wudang's best fighting techniques from her.  As Jen leaves to prepare an antidote for the poisoned dart, Mu Bai prepares to die. With his last breaths, he finally confesses his love for Shu Lien. He dies in her arms as Jen returns, too late to save him. The Green Destiny is returned to Sir Te. Jen later goes to Mount Wudang and spends one last night with Lo. The next morning, Lo finds Jen standing on a bridge overlooking the edge of the mountain. In an echo of the legend that they spoke about in the desert, she asks him to make a wish. He wishes for them to be together again, back in the desert. Jen then jumps off the bridge, plummeting to her death.  
The Crow: Salvation
 In [[Salt Lake City]], Alex Corvis ([[Eric Mabius]]) is a death row convict framed for the murder of his girlfriend Lauren Randall ([[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]]). Three years later, he is [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] in the electric chair. When he is asked for his last words, he says he still loves Lauren and that he is innocent; the guards do their job, and the switch is pulled. The generator is struck by lightning during the electrocution, overriding the electricity, and Alex suffers a painful, excruciating death. Soon after the execution, Alex is resurrected by a mystical crow and gifted with supernatural abilities so he can clear his name and avenge Lauren's death. Alex follows the crow to the [[Salt Lake City]] police department's [[evidence]] room, where he discovers that Lauren was killed by a group of corrupt cops. Alex has a vision of one of the killers, who has a scar on his arm matching one he saw just before his execution. Alex finds the knife that was used on Lauren, and then goes to her grave. There he meets with Lauren's sister Erin ([[Kirsten Dunst]]), who believes he is guilty. He tells her that he will prove his innocence, and disappears.  Alex finds Tommy Leonard ([[David Stevens (actor)|David Stevens]]), a witness at the trial who was paid to give [[Perjury|perjured]] testimony about Alex, and forces him to confess that the cops who murdered Lauren were Madden ([[Bruce McCarthy]]), Martin Toomey ([[Tim DeKay]]), Vincent Erlich ([[Dale Midkiff]]), Stan Roberts ([[Walton Goggins]]), and Phillip Dutton ([[Bill Mondy]]) and that they had paid him off to lie at the trial.  Alex kills Dutton while the latter is attempting to rape two young girls he had pulled over on a bogus drunk-driving charge, leaving a blood stained pattern of a crow on the roof of Dutton's car. Next, Alex kills Erlich in a car crash, but inadvertently drops the list of names of the cops he's after, and Roberts and Toomey find it. Later, Alex gives Erin the registration from Erlich's car, which was leased from the D.E.R.T. Corporation, which lists Erin's family's home address. She then finds out that her father, Nathan Randall ([[William Atherton]]), is in business with the corrupt cops who killed Lauren and that Lauren had uncovered the truth, thus making her father indirectly responsible for her death. Nathan swears he did not intend for Lauren to die, but Erin nevertheless runs from him in horror.  Alex goes to the place where Lauren died and finds Erin there. She blames herself for Lauren's murder, telling Alex that she had told the cops where to go to find Lauren, thinking that they would only arrest Alex. Using the Crow's mystical power, Alex shows Erin how Lauren fought off her attackers before she was murdered and how she should forgive herself. Erin goes home and finds that her father has committed suicide. Later, Alex meets with his lawyer, Peter Walsh, who tells him that Nathan owned a company called Westwind Building, which owns D.E.R.T., now revealed as a front for a [[drug smuggling]] operation. Lauren had witnessed Detective Roberts ([[Walton Goggins]]), killing a man at the Key Club; John then had Lauren killed.  Madden kills Walsh and John kidnaps Erin. Alex starts a shootout at the Key Club in which he impales Roberts with a pipe he breaks off the ceiling, and kills the remaining police. Madden shows up and tries to kill Alex, but his shot accidentally shoots a broken gas pipe; the explosion kills Toomey. Alex walks out of the fire and sees an arm hanging out of the rubble with the scar on it.  The next day, Alex finds out that the man with the scarred arm faked his death and is still at large. Alex goes to the police station to kill John. However, he is no longer invulnerable, as he "fulfilled his duty" after finding the arm with the scar. John begins to stab Alex repeatedly, and as Alex dies from his wounds, John berates him and tells him that Alex himself is Lauren's murderer. In pain and anguish, Alex comes to believe John's lie, and that doubt leaves Alex dead once more. Madden, John and John's secretary ([[Kelly Harren]]) pull Alex into John's secret [[taxidermy]] room, where Erin is tied up with her mouth stitched shut and Walsh's body (missing the left arm, which had been used to fake the scarred arm) is hanging from the ceiling. Erin manages to drop Lauren's locket and the crow drops it next to Alex. Representing a promise of love and truth, the locket revives Alex. Alex sets Erin free and kills both Madden and the secretary, and Erin runs out with John in pursuit. John captures Erin and tries to flee with her in his car, but the rejuvenated Alex catches up with them and exposes John's arm, revealing that he is indeed the man with the scar.  Alex and Erin take John to the site of Alex's death, and strap him into the electric chair. Alex explains to John how electrocution is not merciful, but actually a painful method of execution, and John blusters that he will return from the dead like Alex did and kill Erin. Alex covers John's face with the mask while Erin throws the switch, and they watch him writhe in agony as he is electrocuted. In moments, John bursts into flames and dies screaming while Erin and Alex leave his body to cremate on the chair. Outside the prison, Alex disappears to be reunited with Lauren, and Erin puts the necklace that bound him to her on his gravestone.  
The Crossing (2000 film)
 The film opens with the retreat of the [[Continental Army]] across [[New Jersey]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], after repeated losses and defeats during the [[New York and New Jersey campaign|campaign of 1776]].  After the army narrowly escapes across the river to the [[Pennsylvania]] shore, Washington meets with his officers. In the past six months, they have lost New York City and been chased through New Jersey by the British, and 90% of their troops have either been killed or taken prisoner, or have deserted. In possession of the only boats of any use on that stretch of the Delaware River, the army has a reprieve from further pursuit until the river freezes and they must retreat again, leaving Philadelphia open to capture. Compounding their problems, Washington's closest friend, General Hugh Mercer (a physician in civilian life), reminds him that their supplies of food, medicine, ammunition and winter clothing are dangerously low. Realizing that something must be done or the Revolution will collapse, Washington conceives a plan to cross the river and conduct a surprise attack on the [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] garrison at [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]]. The situation makes the plan appear all but impossible to Colonel John Glover, but due to his loyalty to Washington, he agrees to take the army across. When Washington proposes this operation to his staff, General Gates scoffs at its possibility, going over the line by calling Washington insane and unfit for command. Furious, Washington dismisses Gates from the camp at gunpoint, ordering him into silence. The rest of the staff laughs, but Washington and Glover silence them with the lack of advantages they have. On Christmas night, the Hessians will be feasting and drinking, so the morning after, hopefully still in darkness, the Continentals must take the fight to them while they are sluggish and hung over. The officers have only a few days to prepare their troops and weapons, and the soldiers, until it is time to cross, must be told no more than necessary.  Despite their own fatigue and the winter weather, Washington manages to lift his weary soldiers' spirits, allowing the army to cross the river on the night of December&nbsp;25–26, 1776. The crossing is done in one night, allowing the troops to attack Trenton at eight o' clock in the morning on December 26, 1776, and achieve a stunning victory, capturing almost all the Hessian garrison.  The film claims that none of Washington's men were killed or even wounded.  However, the Army's standard military history textbook, ROTCM 145-20, "American Military History 1607-1958," states on page 61 that in fact two were killed in action, two were wounded, and two men froze to death during the operation.  
Critical Mass (film)
 The film centers around a group of terrorist who take over a nuclear power plant and a security guard at the plant who tries to stop them.  
The Crimson Rivers
  Detective Superintendent (''Commissaire Principal'') Pierre Niemans ([[Jean Reno]]), an investigator well known in Paris, is sent to the small rural [[college town|university town]] of Guernon in the [[French Alps]] to investigate a brutal murder. The victim's body is found  bound in the [[fetal position]] and suspended high on a cliff face, his eyes removed and his hands cut off. Niemans learns that the victim was a professor and the University's librarian, Remy Callois, and he seeks out a local ophthalmologist for an explanation to the removal of the eyes. Dr. Cherneze, once on the University staff, explains that the school's isolation led to in-breeding amongst the professors, with increasingly serious genetic disorders. Recently the trend has reversed, with the local village children becoming ill and the college babies remaining healthy. Cherneze hints that the killer is leaving Niemans clues to their motive by removing the body parts that are unique to each individual - the eyes and hands. Niemans questions the Dean and examines the librarian's apartment, where he finds images of athletic "supermen" juxtaposed with texts on genetic deformities. The Dean's assistant (and son) Hubert translates the title of Callois' Ph.D. thesis as, "We are the masters. We are the slaves. We are everywhere. We are nowhere. We control the crimson rivers."  Coincidentally Detective Inspector (''Lieutenant de Police'') <ref></ref> Max Kerkerian ([[Vincent Cassel]]) is in the nearby town of Sarzac investigating the desecration of the grave of Judith Herault, a girl who died in 1982, and the theft of her photos from the local primary school. The girl was killed in a horrific highway accident, witnessed by her mother, who was so traumatized she took a vow of darkness in a nunnery. The mother tells Kerkerian that when Judith was ten she fell ill, and they went  to get help in Guernon where she was born; she claims they were then attacked by "demons" and, when they fled, her daughter was killed in the road accident. She says the pictures were stolen to erase her daughter from history, and that her face is a threat to the demons who have returned to complete their mission. She tells him it all began in Guernon.  Niemans questions Fanny Ferreira ([[Nadia Farès]]), a [[glaciology|glaciologist]] and student, who is immediately suspect because of her climbing ability. Despite her contempt for the school and its arrogant professors, she works for the university to steer away frequent [[avalanche]]s, and is incensed when Niemans implies she might withhold evidence to protect the school. She tells him that anyone with good equipment could've hoisted the body up the cliff, and brushes off his obvious attraction. Soon after, the [[pathology|pathologist]] reports that it was [[acid rain]] in Callois' eye sockets, which has not fallen in the area since the seventies. Niemans enlists Fanny to take him up the glacier to get ice samples to compare with the acid rain in Callois' eyes. On a hunch, Niemans follows a glacial melt tunnel to a cave that contains a second body, frozen into the ice.  Kerkerian traces a car from the accident to Phillip Sertys in Guernon and meets Niemans while attempting to break into Sertys' apartment. Sertys is the body in the ice, a doctor that worked in the maternity ward at the University hospital. They find Judith's stolen photograph as well as evidence that Sertys was breeding and training fighting dogs - and then they find the dogs, and Niemans the "supercop" is momentarily paralyzed by fear, until Kerkerian coaxes him through.  Sertys was also mutilated, and his eyes replaced with glass prosthetics, "Like you would find at an eye doctor's" remarks the pathologist, leading Niemans to race back to Cherneze's practice. The doctor is already dead, and they almost catch the killer, who fights off Niemans and races away after deliberately emptying Niemans' gun into the wall but not hitting him. Kerkerian gives chase but the killer escapes. Returning to the scene, where the killer has written "I will trace the source of the crimson rivers" in Cherneze's own blood above his body, they learn the prints on Niemans' gun belong to Judith Herault.  Kerkerian goes back to search the grave in Sarzac, which is empty except for a picture, while Niemans goes to Fanny's home. Niemans tells her that although he sees her as physically capable of committing the crimes he doesn't believe her to be guilty. When he returns to the university, the local police captain tells him that Callois' thesis is full of [[Nazi]]-style [[eugenics]], suggesting perfection can be achieved by breeding athletically gifted and intellectually gifted children together.  Kerkerian returns with the photo which Niemans recognizes as Fanny and, on the way to her house, they narrowly avoid being run off the road by the Dean's son as they piece together the story. Due to the poor bloodlines and genetic mutations in the faculty's inbred offspring, the doctors at the hospital had been swapping healthy village children with the university children. Sertys, they deduce, must have swapped Fanny for Judith, and Callois arranged the matches in the college's breeding program. Once at Fanny's house they find the missing hands and eyes of the victims in her basement, but Fanny is now gone and so are her grenades. Niemans gives the order to evacuate the university while he and Kerkerian travel up the mountain to find Fanny.  The duo confront Fanny only to be set upon by Judith, who is her identical twin. Judith tells Fanny to kill Niemans, but she refuses, and instead turns the gun on her sister. At the same time Kerkerian fires at Judith, but hits Fanny in the shoulder and the gunshots trigger an avalanche. Judith is swept away and the rest are buried in the snow until a rescue team arrives with search dogs. Fanny is airlifted to hospital while Kerkerian asks Niemans to explain his fear of dogs.  
Crocodile (2000 film)
 Eight teenagers, including Brady (Mark McLachlan), Claire (Caitlin Martin), Duncan (Chris Solari), Kit (D. W. Reiser), Annabelle (Julie Mintz), Sunny (Summer Knight), Foster (Rhett Jordan) and Hubs (Greg Wayne) are going on a weekend boat trip on a remote lake in Southern California for spring break. As the group are about to depart on their boat, they are warned by Sheriff Bowman ([[Harrison Young]]) to be sensible and keep out of danger. After a day of partying, the group have a bonfire, where Kit tells them a local story about how in the early 1900s, 96 years ago, a hotel owner named Harlan featured a crocodile named Flat Dog at his hotel. He goes on to say that Harlan eventually sets up a shrine to Flat Dog, believing her to be an avatar to the ancient Egyptian crocodile god ([[Sobek]]), creating a cult that worshiped the crocodile. The town eventually ran Harlan away because of his heathenism and torched his hotel years later when Kit was a kid. Close by, two local fishermen destroy a [[crocodile]] nest, only for them both to be attacked by Flat Dog, who devours them both.  The following day the teenagers continue to party. Annabelle's dog, Princess, runs away, leading the group to the crocodile's nest, where Duncan breaks an egg and Hubs hides one in Claire's bag. At night, Sunny becomes incredibly drunk and reveals Brady cheated on Claire with her, resulting in Claire breaking up with Brady. Hubs, who is also heavily intoxicated falls asleep at the bonfire while the rest of the group return to the boat. Sometime later, Hubs attempts to return to the boat but is eaten by Flat Dog, while the boat becomes untied and begins to drift in the lake. In the morning, the friends find their boat has become stuck, leaving them stranded. While the rest of the group attempt to fix the boat, Brady and Sunny go to try to find Hubs. Sunny attempts to get Brady to go swimming, but she narrowly escapes an attack by Flat Dog. The pair rush back to the boat to warn the others. However, Flat Dog arrives and sinks the boat, killing Foster in the process.  Meanwhile, Sheriff Bowman finds the fishermen and Hubs remains before visiting Shurkin ([[Terrence Evans]]) and Lester ([[Adam Gierasch]]), two locals who take care of alligators. Shurkin sets out with the Sheriff to find Flat Dog&mdash;and kill her to avenge the deaths of his grandfather and father&mdash;while Lester is seen to be feeding the crocodile, but is eventually devoured himself. As night falls, the teenagers are still stranded in the woods searching for a road. Flat Dog returns, and ultimately Sunny is eaten. The rest of the group reach a small shop, where Brady attempts to phone the Sheriff, but Flat Dog breaks through a wall and devours Annabelle. As Kit escapes to start the truck outside, Brady, Claire and Duncan fight off Flat Dog. In the chaos, a fire starts which causes the truck to explode, killing Kit and scaring away Flat Dog.  The next day, the Sheriff and Shurkin find Brady, Claire and Duncan and pick them up on their boat. Soon after, Shurkin is knocked into the water and eaten, before the Sheriff is also killed. With the boat's engine broken, the survivors swim to land. Claire finally discovers the crocodile's egg in her bag, and the group use it as bait to lure the crocodile to them so they can kill it. As Flat Dog arrives, Duncan attempts to kill her. However, he is quickly swallowed whole, only to be regurgitated moments later. Claire gives the crocodile the egg, which hatches into a baby crocodile, before it returns to its nest, leaving Claire, Princess, Brady and Duncan free to escape.  
Cry Baby Lane
 Andrew ([[Glint|Jase Blankfort]]) and his older brother Carl (Trey Rogers) enjoy listening to ghost stories that the local undertaker, Mr. Bennett ([[Frank Langella]]), tells them. One night Bennett tells the tale of a local farmer whose wife gave birth to [[conjoined twins]], one being good-natured while the other was clearly evil. The farmer, ashamed of them, kept the twins locked in their room. Eventually the twins got sick from a liver disease and died together, so the farmer sawed them in half and buried the good twin in a [[cemetery]] and the bad twin in a shallow grave near the house, at the end of an old dirt road called Cry Baby Lane, as whoever is caught out there at night will hear the cries of the deceased twin. Later, Andrew, Carl, and a group of friends decide to hold a [[séance]] in the cemetery where the good twin is buried, but soon after the seance, a creepy phenomenon occurs around the town. When Andrew consults Mr. Bennett about it, he confesses that when the twins were separated, the farmer mixed up the twins and tossed the good one in the field and that the good twin is crying for help, not vengeance, and the bad twin possesses nearly everyone in town, and it is up to Andrew to stop him.  However, during the time Andrew and Carl journey into Cry Baby Lane, the evil twin intervenes and possesses Carl who then tries to attack his brother. The evil twin, speaking for Carl, tells Andrew he can't stop his doing as the cries of the good twin become louder and more desperate. Andrew eventually escapes the car and journeys into the good twin's grave where he must cut a root that was wrapped the good twin's skeleton in order to regain peace. The evil twin showers dirt onto the grave, attempting to bury Andrew alive, but Andrew manages to cut the root and save the good twin. The evil twin disappears in a flash of light and everybody returns to normal.  The next day, Andrew wakes up outside of the grave where he finds the good twin's grave with flowers, alluding that the twin is now at peace. Andrew then picks a flower from the grave and gives it to Kathy as they leave Cry Baby Lane.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>

Cutaway (2000 film)
 When U.S. Customs Agent, Victor "Vic" Cooper's (Stephen Baldwin) personnel file is reviewed, it shows that he struggles to disassociate his undercover identities from his real one. Despite the file's recommendation that he not return to active duty, he is cleared for work by Lieutenant Brian Margate (Ron Silver). His first action back is a raid on a [[Bimini]]-based seafood importer, who Cooper believes is smuggling drugs. He is embarrassed to find only shrimp on the aircraft, and the pilot goes free.   Because Cooper personally witnessed drugs being loaded onto the aircraft, he realizes that the only way that they could have been offloaded during the flight is via parachute. He visits a random drop zone and pretends to be interested in taking lessons. Star (Maxine Bahns) shows him around and introduces him to the jump team that runs the camp. Cooper and Star begin flirting immediately, and he enjoys his lessons. She explains how most people there have "cut away" from their old lives to focus just on skydiving. The term also refers to cutting away from your main chute to use your reserve.  Cooper gets Lt. Margate to approve more undercover work, and he visits the Army jump team for some tips from their leader Delmira (Casper Van Dien). When he returns to the dive camp much improved, Randy "Turbo" Kingston (Dennis Rodman) is skeptical of Cooper and remains aloof. As Cooper's dives improve, the leader of the team, Red Line (Tom Berenger) takes an interest in him. Eventually, Cooper is allowed to join the team. As his proficiency increases, he is able to enter the formation faster, which moves him further back in the roster towards Red Line, who always comes out last because he is the fastest diver. This causes internal tension, as well as hurting his romance with Star.   Eventually, Turbo can no longer stand to see Cooper moving closer to his position in front of Red Line. During one dive, Red Line makes Turbo and Cooper fight to see who is the fastest. Turbo goes into a nose dive to move at maximum speed, but he breaks his neck when he plows into the team formation. With Turbo dead, Cooper is elevated to Red Line's second in command, which means that he has to take on Turbo's responsibility with helping Red Line raise money to fund the team.   Red Line takes him on a job with the Bimini seafood importer. Prior to landing on Bimini, Cooper and Red Line jump out of the aircraft. They retrieve the drugs which are hidden just off the runway. Meanwhile, the pilot loads her official cargo and clears customs. Cooper and Red Line sneak back on the aircraft with the drugs, and then they dive off the aircraft again to a buyer's house. They pick up enough money to fund 100 more dives.   Cooper and Red Line go on a series of jumps like this, until they end up at one where the FBI has a sting operation in place. When the FBI raids the party where Cooper and Red Line have arrived with the drugs, Lt. Margate's team moves in. In the ensuing gun fight, Red Line and Lt. Margate end up facing each other with guns drawn. Cooper tackles Red Line, and they jump off the roof together. Red Line is severely injured though, but Cooper forces the team to move forward to the Nationals, where the Army team is waiting to beat them again.   Though badly impaired, Red Line manages to jump with the team, and they are competitive through the first few rounds, until a bad mistake leaves them needing a world record time to beat Army. Before the final jump, Red Line moves Cooper into his position, and the team records a 9.90 second formation jump, establishing a world record and winning the Nationals. As they are floating to the ground, Cooper reveals his identity and arrests Red Line. Not surprised at the news, Red Line stoically cuts away from his main chute and falls to the ground. Cooper mourns over Red Line's body, and walks away from Lt. Margate towards his dive team.

Selma has a degenerative eye condition and is losing her vision. She has been saving up to pay for an operation which will prevent her young son from losing his vision. She also takes part in rehearsals for a production of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' and accompanies Kathy to the local cinema where together they watch fabulous Hollywood musicals, as Cvalda describes them to her.  In her day-to-day life, Selma slips into daydreams. Soon Jeff and Cvalda begin to realize that Selma can barely see at all. Additionally, Bill reveals to Selma that his materialistic wife Linda spends more than his salary, and the bank is going to take his house. To comfort Bill, Selma reveals her eye condition, hoping that together they can keep each other's secret. Bill then hides in the corner of Selma's home, knowing she can't see him, and watches as she puts some money in her kitchen tin.  The next day, after having broken her machine the night before through careless error, Selma is fired from her job. When she comes home to put her final wages away she finds the tin is empty; she goes next door to report the theft to Bill and Linda, only to hear Linda discussing how Bill has brought home their safe deposit box to count their savings. Knowing that Bill was broke and that the money he is counting must be hers, she confronts him and attempts to take the money back. He draws a gun on her, and in a struggle he is wounded. Linda runs off to tell the police at Bill's command. Bill then begs Selma to take his life, telling her that this will be the only way she will ever reclaim the money that he stole from her. Selma shoots at him several times, but due to her blindness manages to only maim Bill further. In the end, she performs a [[coup de grâce]] with the safe deposit box. Selma slips into a trance and imagines that Bill's corpse stands up and slow dances with her, urging her to run to freedom. She does, and takes the money to the Institute for the Blind to pay for her son's operation before the police can take it from her.  Selma is caught and eventually put on trial. It is here that she is pegged as a [[Communism|Communist]] sympathizer and murderess. Although she tells as much truth about the situation as she can, she refuses to reveal Bill's secret, saying that she had promised not to. Additionally, when her claim that the reason she didn't have any money was because she had been sending it to her father in Czechoslovakia is proven false, she is convicted and given the death penalty. Cvalda and Jeff eventually put the pieces of the puzzle together and get back Selma's money, using it instead to pay for a trial lawyer who can free her. Selma becomes furious and refuses the lawyer, opting to face the death penalty rather than let her son go blind, but she is deeply distraught as she awaits her death. Although a sympathetic female prison guard named Brenda tries to comfort her, the other state officials are eager to see her executed. Brenda encourages Selma to walk. On the gallows, she becomes terrified, so that she must be strapped to a collapse board. Her hysteria when the hood is placed over her face delays the execution. Selma begins crying hysterically and Brenda cries with her, but Cvalda rushes to inform her that the operation was successful and that Gene will see. Relieved, Selma sings the final song on the gallows with no musical accompaniment, although she is hanged before she finishes.

Death, Deceit and Destiny Aboard the Orient Express
 When an anonymous benefactor invites a party of celebrities and business magnates to a New Year's celebration aboard the Orient Express, it is the guests' greed which brings them all together. Apart from an enjoyable free trip on the luxury train, the businessmen among the passengers also expect to make a lucrative deal. However, just outside Paris the whole train is taken over by terrorists—without anybody noticing. Jack Chase (Richard Grieco), a young American actor who has also been invited, realizes that one of the waiters is missing but does not know that he has been killed together with all his colleagues.  Very soon the passengers sense that something is wrong. For example, a powerful [[Mobile phone jammer|jamming]] station on board the train ensures that they cannot contact the outside world via their [[mobile phone]]s. Then, before dinner, they get to know their host: It is Tarik (Christoph Waltz), a well-known, internationally wanted [[Arab]] terrorist, who communicates with them via interactive television. Tarik announces the "[[fundamentalism|Fundamentalist]] [[Revolution]]", the "victory of [[faith]] over [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]]", and demands one tenth of each of his hostages' fortunes. Tarik himself is in fact on the train disguised as a cook, but no one has so far found out. The captives also learn that the terrorists have rigged the train with explosives: If the train slows, stops or passes the midnight hour the bombs are rigged to blow.  Predictably, the passengers try to do something about their predicament. While the businessmen ponder the question of whether to pay up or not, it is the women who take an active part in fighting the terrorists, most notably Nadia (Joanna Bukovska), a young [[Russia]]n dancer who has fallen in love with Chase and who even saves his life when he is attacked by one of the thugs. The couple secretly climb on the roof of the train and succeed in finding some of the explosives. In the end, shortly before their arrival in Istanbul, the [[locomotive]], with Tarik in it, is uncoupled from the rest of the train and blown to pieces by the bombs planted by the terrorist himself.  Although the film was released long before the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]], the character of Tarik is a thinly disguised [[Osama bin Laden]]. There are also some minor but obvious parallels to the [[1974 in film|1974]] film ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'', which is based on an [[Agatha Christie]] novel. These parallels almost exclusively concern the setting and the constellation of characters: There are no similarities whatsoever regarding the plot.

The three pressured Sonny to spend more time with them. Unknown to Sonny, his friends planned to rob a house one night. During the robbery, Celso accidentally fired at the owner of the house [[Anita Linda]], killing her. Police came and Jimmy and Rodel were killed, prompting Sonny to freeze and Celso to run. The police finds Sonny at the scene and arrests him.  Sonny was detained and cross-examined. Sonny's lawyer pointed out that his client was still a minor. However, he failed to show ample evidence. Although Sonny didn't kill anyone during the robbery, he was found guilty of [[murder]], which sends him to [[death row]]. After a harsh introduction to prison life during his struggle to come to terms with the court's verdict, he finds his place among the [[convict]]s.  'Mayor' Mio, a fellow [[Incarceration|inmate]] who holds a position of power in the prison [[hierarchy]], attempts to recruit Sonny as a [[illegal drug trade|dealer]] for his [[cocaine]] [[smuggling]] business. Sonny hesitantly accepts. The cocaine business was known to the jail warden Fajardo (Spanky Manikan) who happens to be an accomplice in the illegal business. Gabino ([[Pen Medina]]), Mio's second-in-command, attempts to win Sonny's support as part of his secretive preparations for a [[coup]] against Mio.

He advised Sonny to stop his involvement in the drug business. When a high official visited the prison, Sonny confessed to him about the drug business. Gabino exacts [[revenge]] by giving Sonny a severe beating. Sonny was also raped and tortured.  Sonny sought the help of Gina ([[Jaclyn Jose]]), a public attorney who also handles the case of Lolo Sinat, to appeal his case. Lolo Sinat does not trust Gina, often calling her a stupid lawyer. Gina retaliated and told the old man that he doesn't know how to love. Lolo Sinat tells Sonny about his past and how he was brought to jail. The two became closer, and Lolo Sinat promised Sonny that he will help the boy so that when Lolo Sinat faces God, he could say that once in his life, he has done something right.  With the help of Lukas (Mon Confiado), Lolo Sinat and Sonny escaped, but were also caught the next day. Gina then tells Lolo Sinat that his death penalty will be served the next week. With that, the old man encouraged Gina to help Sonny appeal his case. Gabino tried to rape Sonny again, but the boy fought him. Sonny found a bread knife and stabbed Gabino several times, killing him instantly. Lolo Sinat covered up for Sonny.  Before being brought to the [[lethal injection]] chamber, Lolo Sinat gave his old [[walkman]] to Sonny.  After several weeks, Gina's appeal for Sonny's case became successful. Celso was brought to justice and Sonny was released from jail.

Deterrence (film)
 In 2008, President Walter Emerson, formerly an appointed [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] and elevated by the death of the previous U.S. president, is crossing the U.S. on a campaign tour when a blizzard traps him in a remote [[Colorado]] diner with members of his staff plus a group of ordinary citizens.  Suddenly, word arrives that [[Uday Hussein]], the leader of [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], has invaded [[Kuwait]]. Using a television cameraman who is following his campaign, Emerson notifies the world that unless Hussein orders an immediate retreat and personally surrenders, he will bomb [[Baghdad]] with a nuclear weapon.  Hussein, through his [[Permanent Representative of Iraq to the United Nations|United Nations envoy]], refuses to back down and cuts off telephone negotiations, claiming Emerson is a non-elected leader and also a [[American Jews|Jew]]. He threatens to fire Iraq's black-market [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|nuclear missiles]] at several global locations including Emerson's own, near [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]] in Colorado, if his country comes under attack.  It is learned that Iraq purchased these weapons from [[France]]. Despite being a U.S. ally, the [[President of France|French President]] appears to be cavalier in confirming this with Emerson and his entourage. The sites of the missile launchers include [[Libya]] and [[North Korea]].  Emerson is counseled by his [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]], Marshall Thompson, a former university classmate, and by his [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Adviser]], Gayle Redford. Once his ultimatum is made and the countdown to his deadline begins, the President and his staff are confronted with the opinions of the diner's customers, including its angry owner and cook, Harvey, and a young bigot named Ralph.  Emerson is not only adamant in his beliefs, he seems every bit as willing as Hussein to trigger a nuclear war. He orders a [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2]] bomber to cross Iraq's borders despite the threats of the Iraqi ambassador that this would constitute an act of war. In retaliation, the Iraqis aim 23 nuclear [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]] against various countries, including [[Australia]], [[Japan]], France and other targets.  Emerson argues with advisers while appearing totally confident in his own actions. Suddenly, Harvey brandishes a gun and shoots the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] major carrying the briefcase that contains the launch codes. Emerson's bodyguards then kill the cook in self-defense.  To the horror of all, Emerson carries out his threat. He authorizes the dropping of a 100 [[TNT equivalent|megaton]] bomb on Baghdad, resulting in the complete destruction of that city.  Iraq's retaliation begins. A bomb lands in [[Greece]], but it does not detonate. Neither does a device that lands in Japan. A majority of the other missiles have been intercepted.  A short time later, Emerson addresses the world on TV. He explains that in order to prevent Iraq from attaining nuclear weapons, the U.S. sold it nuclear weapons through the French, while ensuring that they would never be able to function properly.  Already reeling from the shocks of the past few minutes, the President's aides are further astounded when he announces his immediate withdrawal from the election campaign. He did what he felt it necessary to do, but believes that someone else should be the one to carry on.

Devils on the Doorstep
  In a small village named Rack-Armor Terrace in [[Hebei]], at the foot of the [[Great Wall of China]], a local peasant called Ma Dasan (played by [[Jiang Wen]]) is caught by surprise when a man bursts into his home one night and deposits two men in gunnysacks, instructing him at gunpoint to keep them captive but alive for the next few days and interrogate them. The man, identified only as "Me", leaves before Ma can catch a glimpse of him. One of the gunnysacks contains Kosaburo Hanaya ([[Kagawa Teruyuki]]), a belligerent Japanese sergeant; the other Dong Hanchen ([[Yuan Ding]]), an obsequious Chinese interpreter working for the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]]. Ma hurriedly enlists the help of his fellow villagers. Fearing both the mysterious "Me" and the Japanese, the village decides to follow the instructions from "Me" and detains the prisoners in Ma's cellar. Hanaya repeatedly attempts to provoke the peasants into killing him, but Dong, fearing for his own life, alters Hanaya's words in translation to make him appear conciliatory.  The mystery man fails to return by the eve of [[Chinese New Year]] as promised. Six months later, the villagers finally run out of patience and resolve to kill the prisoners. The task falls on Ma after a drawing of lots. Not daring to commit murder, Ma instead hides the prisoners in a watchtower along the Great Wall, where he visits them regularly to bring them food and water. However, an unsuccessful escape attempt by the prisoners reveals Ma's secret to the rest of the village. A bitter argument ensues and the village decides to hire an assassin from town to carry out the deed. Ma enlists the help of an old man known as One Stroke Liu ([[Chen Qiang (actor)|Chen Qiang]]), a former Imperial [[executioner]]. He is told that being beheaded by Liu feels like a passing breeze, and that the severed head will roll nine times on the ground, blink three times, and smile in a gesture of gratitude for such a painless death. However, Liu fails to harm either prisoner with one stroke. Claiming that it is the will of Heaven, Liu leaves with the prisoners uninjured.  By this time, however, Hanaya has lost all his defiance and is filled only with gratitude towards the villagers. He promises to reward the village with two wagons of grain should he be released. The villagers agree and return the prisoners to the Japanese Army encampment in the nearby town. However, the Japanese Army has already made Hanaya a war hero, believing that he was killed in battle. Returning alive after being a prisoner shames the Army. The commander of the encampment, Captain Inokichi Sakatsuka ([[Kenya Sawada]]), gives Hanaya a merciless beating but feels honor-bound to fulfill the agreement between the latter and the village. Captain Sakatsuka and his men bring a great bounty of food and wine to the village and hold a feast there that evening, as Ma goes off to fetch his lover Yu'er ([[Jiang Hongbo]]) from a neighboring village. During the feast, Captain Sakatsuka demands to have the man who captured Hanaya. He also accuses Ma of sneaking off to fetch resistance fighters. Not given a satisfactory answer, he orders all villagers to be killed and the village to be burned. Ma and Yu'er return on a raft only to find the entire village in flames. Meanwhile, Hanaya is about to commit [[harakiri]] before being stopped by Captain Sakatsuka and informed that Japan has recently surrendered, and the war is over.  After the Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]] takes back the area, Dong is publicly executed for collaborating with the enemy. Ma, bent on revenge, disguises himself as a cigarette vendor and loiters outside the Japanese encampment, now converted into a [[Prisoner-of-war camp|POW camp]]. When two Japanese soldiers come out to buy cigarettes, Ma hacks them with an axe and breaks into the camp, killing more POWs. He finds and pursues Hanaya, but is brought down by guards before he can kill the latter. Major Gao ([[David Wu (entertainer)|David Wu]]), commander of the Chinese Army contingent administering the town, condemns Ma's act as too despicable to deserve death by the hands of a Chinese soldier, and instead orders a Japanese POW to carry out the execution before a massive crowd. Captain Sakatsuka hands a [[katana]] to Hanaya, who takes careful aim before delivering the fatal strike. As Ma's head falls to the ground, it rolls nine times, blinks three times, and smiles, just as 'One Strike' Liu's victims were supposed to have done.

Devadoothan
   The story begins with Vishal Krishnamoorthy ([[Mohanlal]]) is a reputed musician, who is about to receive a prestigious musical award for his album "Rhythm of Love". From there, the story cuts back to his past where Vishal is struggling to pay a large debt and to build a career of his own. Despite having a deep knowledge and passion for music, he experiments with other businesses all of which ended in failure. In this context, Vishal gets a letter from the principal-cum-priest ([[Janardhanan (actor)|Janardhanan]]) of his old college, from which he was expelled. It was an invitation to work as the director for a musical play with the present students of the college. At first, Vishal refuses to accept the invitation because of his hatred towards the college, but later decides to go.  Years ago, Vishal was expelled from the college by Madam Angelina Ignatius ([[Jayaprada]]) who runs the institution in memory of her late father, William Ignatius ([[Kitty (actor)|Kitty]]). There was a special musical instrument called the "Seven Bells" which was kept by Angelina, locked in a chapel inside the college and no one was allowed near it. Vishal was accused by Angelina for playing the Seven Bells, although he refused, claiming that the instrument was playing on its own. But Angelina had him expelled from the college.  Vishal arrives at the college. The play is about the love story of Mary and Nikhil Maheshwar. Mary is the only daughter of a rich man who falls in love with a young musician, Nikhil Maheshwar. Despite her father's dislike, she falls deeply in love with Maheshwar. Later, Maheshwar goes back to get the consent of his parents for their marriage, but never returned. Mary keeps waiting for him. While rehearsing the play, Vishal interferes at certain occasions and changes parts of the story.  On the first night after his arrival, as he is composing a song for the play, he hears a beautiful melodic composition from the tape record near him. He turns it off, but the music continues playing, as if from nowhere. He realizes that it is the same symphony that was heard from the Seven Bells instrument for which he was expelled from the college. The next day, as the rehearsal progresses, in a scene where Mary expresses her love to Maheshwar, Vishal suggests that they replace the name Mary with Aleena which he intuitively deduces from the music he heard last night.  At night, Vishal is woken by the same music. He follows it and finds that it is coming from the chapel where the Seven Bells is kept. He immediately rushes there to see who is playing it. He sees nobody but the instrument playing by itself. Hearing the music, Angelina also gets there and sees Vishal sitting in front of the Bells. She accuses him again of playing it and tries to get him out of the college, but Vishal decides to stay and find out the truth.  Vishal asks the principal about the name Nikhil Maheshwar. He says that it was from an old love poem written by Angelina. Looking for answers, he visits an old priest who was the former pincipal of the college and who knew Angelina from a young age. He tells Vishal that her actual name is Aleena. She got the Seven Bells instrument from her father William Ignatius as a gift. William also brought someone from Agra to play the instrument. His name was Maheshwar ([[Vineeth Kumar]]). Aleena's admiration of Maheshwar's music turned to love, to her father's protest. Then after six years, Maheshwar left promising that he would return, but never came back.  Vishal searches for books about the Seven Bells in the college library. He finds a piece of paper with some musical notations from an old book. He feels that it was written by Maheshwar. Trying to play it on the instrument, he recognizes it as the same music he hears at night, when suddenly he feels like he is losing his vision. By intuition, he concludes that Maheswar was blind. He goes to Angelina and shows the music to her. She admits that it was created by Maheshwar and she wrote it down. She now realizes that Vishal was innocent of the accusation for which he was expelled from college.  At night, when Vishal is sitting in front of the Seven Bells, Sneha ([[Vijayalakshmi (Kannada actress)|Vijayalakshmi]]), the student who plays role of Aleena in the play and who is a fan of Vishal's music comes to the chapel and requests him to play the bells. Vishal reveals the truth that it is not he who plays the instrument but some invisible person.  Vishal dreams about a horse carriage and when he tells it to Angelina, she brings Vishal to see the old carriage in which she used to take Maheshwar out. There he meets Alberto ([[Murali (Malayalam actor)|Murali]]), William's old stableman. Vishal feels something mysterious about Alberto. Vishal goes to the library again to find more books about the Seven Bells, but he finds a human skeleton in a glass case. He is told by the principal that it was the workers who got it when they dug the soil for laying the foundation for a new hostel block.  Vishal finds out from Alberto that Maheswar was buried alive by him and Aleena's father William, right after which Alberto dies. The skeleton in the library is Maheshwar's. When Vishal tells Sneha that he cannot let Aleena know about the truth, the Seven Bells starts playing violently. Aleena now understands and she goes to the library hall where the skeleton is kept. Vishal tries to stop her but he is unable to do so. At the end, they find Aleena dead and two doves are seen outside, flying away .

The Dish
 The [[radio telescope]] at [[Parkes, New South Wales|Parkes]] ([[Parkes Observatory]]), [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], was used by [[NASA]] throughout the [[Apollo program]] to receive signals in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], along with the NASA [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station]] near [[Canberra]].  In the days before the July 1969 space mission that marked mankind's first steps on the Moon, NASA was working with a group of Australian technicians who had agreed to engineer a space-to-earth interface to carry the video and telemetry signals from the Lunar Lander on the Moon and relay them to the rest of the global audience, estimated then at some 600 million people. The actual dish antenna used had to be large as the signals expected from the spacecraft were very weak and easily lost.  NASA had to use the Parkes radio telescope situated in the middle of an Australian sheep farm. There were some background concerns at NASA about using the Parkes antenna, mainly technical, as the signals had to go via point to point microwave links to get re-transmitted globally.  Based on a true story, "The Dish" takes a sometimes comical look at the differing cultural attitudes between Australia and the U.S. while revisiting one of the greatest events in history. It depicts the activities in a control room of a radio telescope doing a job it was not originally expected to do. The film depicts some animosity between the Australian staff and the NASA representative, but they come together as a team when one of the locals fails to properly service a backup generator, putting their part in the mission at risk. They apply all their science skills to reacquire the signal and cover their mistake, so that everything works out in the end. The directors of the film portray, quite accurately, what is in essence, a complex technical task, such as re-pointing the dish when it loses the signal's "lock" and deciding to use it when the wind whips up threatening to damage the structure. The film dramatises the team-work of a few technicians, who sometimes nearly lose their cool with each other, painted against a backdrop of proud Australian townfolk, with visiting dignitaries hoping nothing will go wrong at the crucial moment.  
Dinosaur (film)
 A ''[[Carnotaurus]]'' ambushes and pursues an infant ''[[Parasaurolophus]]'', triggering a stampede which forces an ''[[Iguanodon]]'' mother to abandon her nest. The large theropod then succeeds in killing a ''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]''. The one surviving egg journeys through several predicaments including being carried off via the flight of a ''[[Pteranodon]]'', before ending up on a far away island populated by lemurs. One of the lemurs, Plio ([[Alfre Woodard]]), names the hatched baby Aladar and raises him despite her father, Yar's ([[Ossie Davis]]) original objections. Years later, an adult Aladar ([[D. B. Sweeney]]) and the lemurs take part in the mating ritual, where Aladar's friend, Zini ([[Max Casella]]), goes without a mate. Moments after the ritual ends, a giant [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|meteor shower]] strikes and destroys the island, spreading destruction in its wake. Aladar, Plio, Zini, Yar and Plio's daughter, Suri ([[Hayden Panettiere]]), jump into the sea and flee to the mainland. They mourn for their losses before moving on.  While crossing the deserted wastelands, they are ambushed by a pack of hungry ''[[Velociraptors]]''. After escaping, the family comes across a remaining multi-species herd of dinosaurs led by Kron ([[Samuel E. Wright]]) and his [[second-in-command]], Bruton (Peter Siragusa), who are on a journey to reach the "Nesting Grounds", a valley said to be untouched by the meteor. As Aladar and the lemurs befriend a trio of elderly dinosaurs ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' Baylene ([[Joan Plowright]]), ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' Eema ([[Della Reese]]) and doglike ''[[Euoplocephalus]]'' Url, Kron permits them to follow the herd. Together, they migrate across the desert to a lake they have relied on for past trips. Though it has seemingly dried up, Aladar and Zini discover the buried water beneath the surface and Baylene is able to bring it up, saving the herd from [[dehydration]] despite Kron claiming it for himself. Impressed by Aladar's compassionate ways, Kron's younger sister Neera ([[Julianna Margulies]]) begins to fall in love with him.  Meanwhile, two ''Carnotaurus'' pick up the herd's trail and begin stalking them for food. Bruton and an ''Iguanodon'' scout are sent by Kron to search for water, but are attacked by the Carnotaurus. Bruton escapes badly wounded, while the scout is eaten by one of the ''Carnotaurus''. Bruton returns to the herd and warns Kron that they are being followed, putting the entire herd in a state of panic. Kron picks up the pace and quickly evacuates the herd, leaving Aladar (whom he threatens with execution after trying to slow the herd down), the lemurs, the elder dinosaurs and Bruton behind, while the ''Carnotaurus'' are in pursuit. During a rainstorm, the stragglers spend the night in the cave, where Plio heals Bruton, and the ''Carnotaurus'' find and attack them. Bruton saves the others by causing a cave-in to kill one of the ''Carnotaurus'', sacrificing himself in the process. As the rest of the group venture deeper through the cave, the other ''Carnotaurus'', having survived, leaves and vengefully resumes searching for the herd.  Aladar loses hope when they reach a dead end, but the others convince him to keep going, relating how he inspired them to do the same. After they break through the dead end together and successfully find the Nesting Grounds on the other side, Eema sees a large wall of rocks blocking the original entryway to the valley. Knowing that the herd will die attempting to climb over it, Aladar rushes off alone to find them, pursued by the surviving ''Carnotaurus''. As Aladar catches up with the herd and suggests the safer way to the valley, a stubborn Kron furiously tries to kill him until Neera stops them, silently disowning her brother and denouncing his leadership of the herd. The herd decides to abandon Kron and takes Aladar as their new leader. As they prepare to leave, the ''Carnotaurus'' confronts them. Aladar rallies the herd to stand together, and they bellow their way past the predator. The ''Carnotaurus'' pursues Kron on the ledge and, after a brief struggle, fatally bites him on the back. Aladar and Neera fight against the ''Carnotaurus'' until it is knocked into the ravine, where it plummets to its death. The two are relieved, but their joy is short-lived when they find that Kron has succumbed to his wounds.  In the aftermath, the herd are led along the new route to the Nesting Grounds, which becomes their new home. A new generation of dinosaurs hatch sometime later, including Aladar and Neera's children. The lemurs find more of their kind, and soon they begin embarking on a new life together.  
Disney's The Kid
 Russ Duritz works as a successful but impolite [[image consultant]] in Los Angeles and has a strained relationship with his father. One of his clients is a stadium manager who is reneging on a previous promise to fund a baseball camp for disadvantaged children. When Russ makes a [[Pieing|pie throwing]] video to fabricate an explanation, his coworker Amy urges him to reconsider.  When Russ returns home to find a toy plane on his porch, he assumes it is a gift from his father. However, inside he finds a strange boy, and chases him through the streets. After seeing the boy enter Skyway Diner, Russ runs in and finds no sign of him. Believing the experience to be a hallucination, Russ frantically sees a psychiatrist for medication the next day, but finds the same boy on his couch eating popcorn and watching ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'' when he returns home. The boy says his name is Rusty, that he was just searching for his toy plane, but came across the popcorn. Starting to see a resemblance, Russ begins comparing memories and [[birthmark]]s with Rusty, and figures out that the boy is actually himself as a kid. After a series of probing questions about Russ's life, Rusty tells him, "I grow up to be a loser."  Amy finds out about the boy the next day and starts to think that Russ and Rusty are father and son. After she accuses Russ of being a dead-beat dad, Rusty assures her he is not Russ's son. Rusty implores Russ to tell Amy the truth about their identities, but Russ thinks she'd never believe them. Amy discovers the truth on her own while watching the two argue; Russ, and Rusty are nearly identical in style, and intensity.    When Amy finds out that Russ lied about airing the stadium manager's tape, she gets mad at him and leaves disappointed.   Russ cancels his appointments the following day, and spends the time walking with Rusty, and driving around the city trying to figure out why Rusty is there, and what from the past needs to be fixed to get Rusty back home. As they drive through a tunnel, Russ recalls a fight he lost with some neighborhood bullies who were abusing a three-legged dog named Tripod. They emerge from the tunnel to find themselves reliving Rusty's eighth birthday in 1968. Russ helps Rusty win the fight and save Tripod, but suddenly remembers that because of the fight, his sick mother also came to school for him that day. When they get home, Rusty's father angrily shakes and scolds him for getting into trouble and causing his mother more stress. Rusty cries while attempting to tell his father that he found a screw he lost, but his father tells him to grow up while rubbing Rusty's tears away harshly, causing a lifelong facial tic. Russ tells Rusty that his mother will die before his next birthday, then comforts him. Tearfully, Russ tells Rusty that his father's outburst was because his dad was scared that he didn't know how to raise him alone, and also assures Rusty that he was not responsible for his mother's death.   The two go to Skyway Diner, and celebrate their birthday. When a dog named Chester greets Rusty, they find out that his owner is an older version of Russ who owns planes, and has a family with a woman who is clearly an older version of Amy. Realizing that Rusty's appearance was meant to change his ways rather than the other way around, Russ returns to his time, arranges plans to see his father, buys his assistant tickets to Hawaii, and, with a puppy, returns to Amy, who invites him into her home.  
Diamond Men
 Eddie Miller ([[Robert Forster]]) is a traveling salesman, servicing towns in Pennsylvania. He sells diamonds and jewelry to 'Mom & Pop' one of a kind stores. In the business for thirty years, he is weary of the grind after recovering from a heart attack, the recent death of his wife, and the corporate take-over that he senses will eliminate his employment. He is a 'liability', a dinosaur. A last task: train his replacement, Bobby Walker ([[Donnie Wahlberg]]). This is a 'road' film, 'buddy' film, and 'coming-of-age' film as the plot unfolds. Eddie eases up on the brash, uncouth Bobby, and they eventually develop a mutual respect; learning from each other. Tina ([[Jasmine Guy]]), a Madam with a heart of gold, and Katie ([[Bess Armstrong]]) as a reluctant prostitute complete the cast of characters.  
Die Bad
 The first of the film's four parts is titled ''Rumble''. The events start with two groups of rival teenagers hanging out in a bar, playing pool. They end up fighting and the main character Park Sung-bin accidentally kills another youth. He is thrown to prison for the next seven years.  The second part is titled ''Nightmare'' after the dreams Sung-bin still has about the man he killed. Sung-bin is trying to get back on track after being released from prison. He manages to get a job in a garage with the help of his brother, but his father still seems to loathe him for his past misdeeds. Eventually Sung-bin ends up saving a local crime boss, Kim Tae-hoon from a brutal beating and gets a job from him.  The next segment, ''Modern Man'', intermixes fake documentary style interviews with a long fight between Kim Tae-hoon and Suk-hwan, an old friend of Sung-bin who was with him on the night that Sung-bin killed the man. Suk-hwan is now a police officer and his part of the interview tells about his job fighting crime while Kim Tae-hoon's interview segments show him speaking about his career in crime.  The last, longest segment is titled ''Die Bad''. Sung-bin is taking control of his own group after Kim Tae-hoon is taken to prison. Sung-bin recruits a gang of youths, including Suk-hwan's brother, to serve as knife fodder in largely meaningless fights. In the end, Suk-hwan confronts and kills Sung-bin, but his brother is also killed.  
Ditto (2000 film)
 The film begins with Yoon So-eun ([[Kim Ha-neul]]), a student at Silla University eagerly awaiting a certain student Dong-hee ([[Park Yong-woo]]) returning to school after serving in the army. She meets him outside the [[amateur radio]] club room, where she tells him HAM radio is her hobby, and he thanks her for all the letters she wrote him during the war. Visiting her friend Sunmi-Hur who is recuperating from a broken leg in the hospital, So-eun tells her she is in love with Dong-hee.  At home, one night, she is awakened by a call on her radio, from another radio enthusiast, Ji In ([[Yoo Ji-tae]]). They discover that they attend the same university and plan to meet in front of the school clock tower, where Ji In offers to lend So-eun a book for amateur HAM radio operators. At the set time, both wait for the other, So-eun in front of an unfinished clock tower in the heat and dust, and Ji In in front of a completed one, in heavy rain. Later at night, they argue about the why the other person did not show up, and about the weather, and Ji In is suddenly shocked to discover he is speaking over a radio with a disconnected power plug. Further, Ji In, is then jolted with the information which So-eun reveals: she is a Junior in 1979, he is a sophomore in 2000. At first he begins to doubt So-eun's words, but is slowly convinced despite the improbability of what is happening to him.  Meanwhile, So-eun's relationship with Dong-hee is progressing well, and they end up dating. So-eun talks about her new-found relationship with Sunmi at the hospital, but is not able to spend as much time with her now. Ji In is close to a girl at school Seo Hyeon-ji ([[Ha Ji-won]]) whom he takes for granted as she is always hanging around him, but for whom he comes to care for deeply. So-eun is increasingly irritated with the conversations she has with Ji In over the radio, thinking he is lying about living in the year 2000. He then offers her some snippets from her future and his past, which finally make her believe that Ji In has been speaking the truth. So-eun then excitedly asks him about the future, and they also start to confide in each other about their personal lives, Ji In telling So-eun to think of him as a sort of diary that talks. She begins talking about being in love, and Dong-hee.  During some student demonstrations, Dong-hee is injured and So-eun goes to visit him tearfully, and signs her name on the plaster cast on his arm. She also visits Sunmi who is at the same hospital. That night, she talks to Ji In about signing her name on Dong-hee, and how that gave her the feeling that he belongs to her. Ji In suddenly mentions that his parents went to Silla University at the same time as her, and that she might know them, and reveals their names as Sunmi-Hur and Dong-hee. This breaks So-eun's world apart, and she runs to the hospital to see the sleeping Dong-hee with Sunmi's name now signed on his plaster cast. She goes about in a daze, remembering Sunmi and Dong-hee bonding while they were at the hospital, avoiding Sunmi, who has returned to school from the hospital, and feeling a strange sense of unknown guilt as she dreams about Dong-hee. She has another conversation with Ji In, where he talks about finding out one's true destination, and breaks up with Dong-hee the next day.  Ji In, on a visit to his parent's country home, sees pictures of his parents from school, the plaster cast his father's arm had been in once, the names signed on it and sees So-eun's name on there. He probes through the school yearbook of 1979 and is startled with the revelation that the lady he has been speaking with every night, was in love with his own father. The realization strangely disturbs and affects him. He wonders what would happen to him if So-eun chose to be with his father, and sets out to find out how So-eun is faring in his time, the year 2000. He finds her as a professor of English at another university and is touched to see her still single, but beautiful and happy, while So-eun smiles at him with vague recognition as she passes by. He leaves to tell So-eun over the radio that he saw her that day.  However, the radio does not seem to work now, and it is the end of the strange companionship across the barriers of time. Ji In goes back to his world, accepting his girlfriend Hyeon-ji, and So-eun gets on with her life, having realized Dong-hee was not meant to be her destination.  
Digimon: The Movie
  ===Angela Anaconda=== A four-minute short film featuring characters from the ''[[Angela Anaconda]]'' series appeared before the film in the theatrical and home media releases. In this segment, Angela and her friends line up to watch ''Digimon: The Movie'', but Nannette and her friends cut in line since they have passes. As Angela makes a mad dash to save seats for her friends, Mrs. Brinks (with help from Nannette) sits in front of her, blocking her view. Angela scornfully imagines herself Digivolving into Angelamon to defeat Mrs. Brinks and Nannette, removing all obstacles in enjoying her movie. However, everyone in the audience realizes they are in the wrong movie, so they quickly leave to go to the correct theater, leaving Mrs. Brinks and Nannette behind with the latter covered in food. Scenes from this short would later be reused in the episode "Good Seats".  ===Eight Years Ago===  In Highton View Terrace, before their adventure in the Digital World, siblings Tai and Kari Kamiya witness a Digi-Egg emerging from their computer. The egg soon hatches, revealing a Botamon. The Digimon rapidly digivolves into Koromon and then a very large Agumon, who unintentionally destroys a good part of the neighborhood, Kari states that this isn't the same Agumon they become friends later with. A second Digi-Egg appears in the sky to reveal a Parrotmon. Some of the neighborhood watches as Agumon digivolves to Greymon to fight Parrotmon, but brutally loses the battle. Tai wakes Greymon with Kari's whistle, who defeats Parrotmon and disappears with him.  ===Four Years Later===  About six months after the DigiDestined departed from the Digital World, Izzy discovers a Digi-Egg on the internet that has been infected by a virus. He rushes over to Tai's apartment to inform him about the newly hatched Digimon, Kuramon. Tai and Izzy monitor it and are astonished as Kuramon consumes large amounts of computer data to rapidly digivolve to Keramon.  Gennai appears in a transmission from the Digital World, warning them about the dangers of his growth. He dispatches Agumon and Tentomon to stop the Digimon. Keramon digivolves into Infermon and easily defeats the Champion and Ultimate forms of Tentomon and Agumon. Izzy realizes that Keramon completely skipped over his Champion form and digivolved straight to his Ultimate level. Tai tries to alert the rest of the DigiDestined, but only succeeds in enlisting the help of Matt, T.K., Gabumon and Patamon. Agumon and Gabumon Warp Digivolve to WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon, prompting Infermon to Digivolve into [[Diaboromon]]. A massive amount of emails are sent to Tai and Izzy from people around the world who are watching the battle from their computers. This [[Denial-of-service attack#Unintentional denial-of-service|causes WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon to slow down]] and they are severely injured in the fight. Diaboromon begins to [[Fork Bomb|duplicate himself at an exponential rate]] and infects computers at [[the Pentagon]], launching two nuclear [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s: one headed for [[Colorado]], the other for Tai and Izzy's neighborhood in Odaiba, [[Tokyo]]. Refusing to lose hope, Tai and Matt's bond with their Digimon allow them to become digital and enter the internet to comfort WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon. Tai and Matt remind them about all the people around the world watching them and sending emails with encouraging words. WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon are revived by the collective power of the millions of children around the world and DNA Digivolve to Omnimon. Omnimon easily defeats all of the Diaboromon copies, leaving only the original. With one minute left until the missile impact, Diaboromon is still too fast for them to hit. With seconds left on the clock, Izzy redirects the incoming emails to Diaboromon to slow him down. Omnimon destroys Diaboromon by stabbing him through the head just in time and the nukes are disabled just before detonation. However, the same virus that created Diaboromon tracks down Willis and corrupts Kokomon.  ===Present Day===  While visiting Mimi in [[New York City]], T.K. and Kari witness a battle between Willis, Terriermon, and Kokomon's corrupted Champion form [[Wendigomon]] (still referred to as Kokomon). Wendigomon cryptically insists for Willis to "go back", to which he interprets as returning to Colorado. Thinking that he is to be in danger, Kari e-mails Davis Motomiya, Yolei Inoue, and Cody Hida for help in hopes of assembling in Colorado. However, T.K. and Kari's train becomes derailed by Wendigomon on the way and they are unable to meet with the others. Meanwhile, after taking planes and taxis, Davis, Yolei, and Cody meet Willis in a truck. When Willis tries to get their group transportation to his house for some pizza, the ride leaves without him and Davis; however, Davis devises a plan to get themselves to Colorado faster with the help of Raidramon. At the rendez-vous point, Davis, Yolei, and Cody began to question Willis' knowledge about Wendigomon. Hesitantly, Willis reveals that he, as a child, tried to create a digi-egg after experiencing the joys of having his twin Digimon (Terriermon and Kokomon). However, this only resulted in Diaboromon's creation. Willis assumes full responsibility for the situation. However, Davis and Terriermon convince him to let them help, as they are friends and are on the same team. At Willis's home the next morning, Wendigomon expectedly reappears, but Digivolves to Antylamon and easily defeats the DigiDestined. Once digivolved into Cherubimon, he proceeds to eat their Digimon, but T.K. and Kari arrive at the nick of time to provide back-up with Angemon and Angewomon. Angry, Cherubimon de-Digivolves the Digimon then de-ages the Digidestined, revealing that he wanted Willis to "go back" in time to when the "strange" spirit first attacked him. To combat him, Angewomon and Angemon Digivolve to their Mega forms, Magnadramon and Seraphimon, to release two Golden Digi-Eggs for Willis and Davis. Veemon and Terriermon Golden Armor Digivolve to Magnamon and Rapidmon and allow themselves to be swallowed by Cherubimon. Inside, they see a manifestation of Wendigomon's true self, who begs them to destroy the virus. After doing so, Cherubimon succumbs to his injuries and dies. After saying goodbye to his new friends, Willis and Terriermon walk back home to find Kokomon's Digi-egg on the beach.  
Dirty Pictures
 [[Dennis Barrie]] books a potentially controversial exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe's nude photography for the Contemporary Arts Center and, with the support of his [[board of directors]], opts to keep it on the schedule even after the prestigious [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, DC]] cancels it from their orface.  Even before the exhibit opens, controversy about its content arises and is fueled by the local media, and after it does, Barrie is indicted and put on trial on pandering and obscenity charges, and he and his family become the center of the highly charged case. As time passes, they become the targets of ongoing harassment and ridicule, are ostracized by their friends, offered a substantial bribe by the shady spokesman for a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] organization, and bullied by Monty Lobb, leader of the conservative group People for Community Values, but also find themselves receiving a great deal of support from not only the art community at large, but local citizens as well. As his marriage begins to disintegrate and the prospect of a jail sentence looms before him, he finds himself torn between his devotion to his family and his determination to defend the doctrines of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].  Barrie ultimately is found not guilty. Via an [[epilogue]] we learn his marriage eventually ended in [[divorce]] and, despite his legal victory, his experience and the wide publicity it received consequently impacted on other museum curators and boards who opted to avoid presenting potentially controversial exhibits in their venues for fear of a similar backlash.  Throughout the film, scripted scenes intermingle with archival interviews with [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Jesse Helms]], [[Patrick Buchanan]], [[Barney Frank]], [[William F. Buckley, Jr.|William Buckley]], [[Susan Sarandon]], and [[Salman Rushdie]].

Doraemon: Nobita and the Legend of the Sun King
  A [[Mesoamerican]] kingdom, called [[Maya civilisation|Mayana]], is ruled by a queen until an evil witch, Ledina, casts a spell putting her into an eternal sleep. Until the queen awakes, the throne is passed to her young son, Prince Tio.  In the present day, Nobita and his friends are rehearsing for a school play based on ''[[Snow White]]'' with Doraemon's gadgets, but a series of miscasts halt their progress. Gian selfishly takes the gadgets to perform on an imaginary stadium, leading to Doraemon, Nobita, and Shizuka's attempt to take them back through a time portal. Gian's violent reaction breaks the portal, unknowingly connecting it to a tree in the forests of Mayana. Tio's pet [[jerboa]]-like creature, Popol ransacks Nobita's room and spreads his test papers throughout the forest, forcing Nobita and Doraemon to cross the portal to collect them. Along the way, Nobita is cornered by Tio until both land on a mud lake; to his surprise, he finds out that both of them look-alike. The three attempt to escape through the portal, but Nobita lags behind and gets captured by the kingdom guards, who mistake him for Tio. Tio himself, amazed by the "magic" of present-day technology, decides that he will temporarily switch roles with Nobita for several days, which Doraemon reluctantly agrees.  At Mayana, culture shock and unexpected demands for a prince to wage war are Nobita's initial hardships while assuming Tio's role. However, Nobita astonishes the masses and Tio's associates with his friendly nature, as they had to face their prince's usual pride and rudeness. Using Doraemon's gadgets, he helps the poor kingdom, cursed by Ledina, by manipulating the weather, further amazing the people. Nobita befriends Tio's childhood friend, Kuku, whose father, Ishumaru, serves as Tio's battle tutor. Kuku, long having had a crush on Tio, is pleased by "Tio's" change of attitude when Nobita accepts her offer to make him a necklace. Meanwhile, Tio's surly and violent tendencies constantly causes problems and eventually annoys even the likes of Shizuka, causing Doraemon to expose the secret. With Tio returning to Mayana alongside Doraemon, Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo, Nobita is forced to wear a woman's attire so as to not confuse the others. Gian offers to become Ishumaru's student and Nobita helps Tio win a match in a [[Mesoamerican ball game|ball game]]. After Nobita and his friends' departure, Kuku presents her necklace for Tio, who harshly rejects it, leading her to run away crying. However, Tio suddenly remembers Shizuka calling him out on his behavior while posing as Nobita and runs after Kuku to apologize. As Kuku cries near the river, Ledina's animal-controlling henchman kidnap her to lure Tio at her palace.  The next day, Tio and Ishumaru stage Kuku's rescue, accompanied by Nobita, now wearing the prince attire back as well as the necklace given to him by Kuku, and his friends. While attempting to escape a snake pit, Ishumaru seemingly falls to his death. Unbeknownst to the group, Ledina sees that Tio disobeyed her demand to come alone at her palace and decides to eliminate the others. The group is then attacked by the henchman who kidnapped Kuku at the river, where Tio is kidnapped by an eagle and falls into the jungle. The others successfully manage to defeat the henchman when Doraemon feeds a special kind of bubblegum to the man's crocodile steed, which upon consuming the gum has its belly inflated and floats up to the sky. While trying to find Tio, an illusion-causing underling of Ledina informs the group that Kuku will be sacrificed at Ledina's [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid]]-shaped temple.   The group move onto the pyramid where they are attacked and eventually defeat Ledina's illusion-causing henchman. Ledina tells "Tio" to come to her as a sacrifice for restoring her youth during the [[solar eclipse]] in exchange for Kuku's life. Ledina demands the group not to get in her way, and she burns Doraemon's four-dimensional pocket with her powers and sends out her warrior henchman who attacks Gian. A fight ensues, but Ishumaru, having survived his fall, comes to Gian's aid and defeats the warrior. Nobita seemingly offers himself, but reveals that he had a spare pocket and uses a switching handkerchief to replace Kuku with a stone statue before attempting to escape. Enraged at his attempt to resist her, Ledina captures Nobita, but the people of Mayana arrive to save "Tio". Ledina is unimpressed by this and is about to kill Nobita, but Tio, having survived his fall, reveals himself and offers to sacrifice himself for Nobita who taught him about friendship. Unfortunately, Ledina sees that she's running out of time and decides to just use Nobita, but the [[sun]] shines on Kuku's necklace which sends out a blinding light on Ledina giving him a chance to be freed from her grasp and throw Doraemon the spare pocket. Ledina's ritual soon fails and reveals her true, elderly appearance. She activates the temple's self-destruct system in one final attempt to kill Tio, but he and Nobita are saved by Ledina's [[condor]], turned friendly by Doraemon's [[Momotaro]] dangos.  Kuku is successfully rescued, though she remains in an enchanted sleep. Shizuka suggests that she can only be woken up by her "prince", akin to the ending of ''Snow White''; Tio heeds and kisses Kuku, freeing her from the spell. The queen, having awoken from her sleep, announces that Tio will succeed her as king. To their dismay, Nobita and his friends find out that the portal is weakening and likely unable to connect with Maya again. Without Tio's presence, Nobita bids his last farewell to him.

 The plot concerns the adventures of João Grilo ([[Matheus Nachtergaele]]) and Chicó ([[Selton Mello]]), the most cowardly of men.  Both struggle for daily bread in a telling representation of the life of the poor in North-East Brazil (O Nordeste) and gull a series of comical stereotypes—baker, landowner, and priest—in a series of interrelated episodes united by the passion of the adulterous baker's wife for her little dog who dies from eating the food she supplies to them as occasional workers, and the daughter of the landowner Antônio Morais ([[Paulo Goulart]])—a magnificent comic character who represents the colonial pretensions of the erstwhile "colonial" class who owned the great estates (or "fazendas") of the region in which sugar production was central to a once-booming economy.  The Catholic Church gets a particularly lively ragging for its combination of simony and superstition as represented by the put-on parish priest ([[Rogério Cardoso]]) and a domineering bishop ([[Lima Duarte]]) no less self-interested than him—while a larger than life bandit Severino de Aracaju ([[Marco Nanini]]), who attacks the town and slaughters the inhabitants, is ultimately forgiven by Jesus in a posthumous denouément set in Heaven.  There the fate of the main characters is mercifully arbitrated by in a court-room contest between Satan and a black Jesus, with the Virgin Mary ([[Fernanda Montenegro]]) interceding as the Virgin in keeping with her prayer-book promise. Odd and extravagant as this tacked-on scene is, it conveys the morality of the film better than the antecedent scenes since every character manages to reveal a saving grace as well as demonstrating the unforgiving harshness of the Nordeste environment which they all share and endure in different ways.  Last to die in the bandits' onslaught is João himself—given as "Jack" in the English subtitles—which contain many idiomatic expressions.<ref></ref> An intensely witty and ingenious rogue in the best picaresque tradition, he contrives to spin everyone around his finger throughout the narrative and ends by getting Severino to order his side-kick to shoot him dead so that he can meet his revered saint in heaven for some minutes on the understanding that a miraculous harmonica which João has ingeniously convinced him possesses the power of bringing the dead back to life—in this case Chicó rigged up with a little balloon of blood—will effect his speedy resurrection. In heaven with the rest, João is more or less master of his fate and manages to down-face the Devil himself ([[Luis Melo]]) in the little matter of eternal damnation. With becoming modesty he refuses to claim any personal virtues and turns down the Virgin's offer of a purgatorial sentence but accepts instead the compassionate offer of a return to earth to 'sin no more'—but do not expect a pious conversion!  His resurrection coincides with the moment when Chicó is digging him a sandy grave, triggering a comical mixture of dismay and joy as he rises from the wagon on which he has been laid out in death. Together the two donate their ill-gotten gains from the other deceased characters to the Virgin, to whom  Chicó promised such a recompense if his friend came back to life—hardly expecting that he would. Now they proceed with Plan B: to get Chicó married to Rosinha, the daughter of the landlord. Here a marriage bargain involving a lump-sum payment or the skin off Chicó's back is foiled by reference to the legal contrivance familiar from The Merchant of Venice of [[William Shakespeare]]—that is, the skin may be owing but not a drop of blood must be taken with it. João, Chicó and the bride now make their escape and enter gleefully into a life of penury on the dusty roads of the region, only to meet with a beggar of dark complexion whom we know to be Jesus. It is the bride—now reduced to penury for the first time in her existence—who breaks bread with him while the others philosophise about Jesus's propensity to test the faithful and just in such a way. At the same time they playfully doubt that Jesus could have been so brown—as João puts it while still in Heaven—reiterating the anti-racist message of the script and its original.  The film wanders in and out of realism, commedia dell'arte and Morality Play but consistently holds the focus on the realities of Brazilian life in the 1950s period when the original text was written. When the exoneration of the desperate bandit Severino is delivered by Jesus at the behest of his Holy Mother, a series of black-and-white stills of rural poverty in the Nordeste   Brazil are screened, giving the whole a sense of social feet-on-ground which belies its comic brio. In spite of plot variations, the film is extremely faithful to the comic spirit and moral ethos of its literary source, and remains a classic of Brazilian cinema with a faithful audience in the region where it is set—an audience that knows every line, every jape and every twist of the busy plot. It deserves to be better known worldwide if only for the performances (without exception) but requires, to some extent, a specifically Brazilian sense of context for its sympathetic appreciation. Even in that context, the Nordeste sentiment is markedly in the ascendant.  
Dora-heita
 A new magistrate (played by Kōji Yakusho) in the town of Horisoto—widely reputed to be the most lawless township in Japan, uses guile and his opponents' own misperceptions and prejudices to defeat his enemies and uproot corruption.<ref name="Carter2010"></ref>

 An anthropomorphic dog named Sture is talked into taking a trip to [[Paris]] by his friend Picasso. After a series of misfortunes they end up in Scotland instead, staying at a mysterious hotel. Picasso remains ignorant and believes they are in Paris. Sture befriends the novelist Miss Mops and gets to meet several mysterious characters living in the hotel as strange events revolving around an Egyptian artifact start to take place.  
Dracula 2000
 Matthew Van Helsing, the alleged descendant of the famed 19th century Dutch physician [[Abraham Van Helsing]], owns an antique shop built over the site of Carfax Abbey in [[London]] in 2000. One night, with Van Helsing upstairs, his secretary, Solina, allows a group of thieves, led by her boyfriend, Marcus, into the shop. The thieves infiltrate the shop's underground high-security vault and find a sealed silver coffin protected by a deadly defense system. Based on the level of security surrounding the coffin, Solina and Marcus decide that the coffin's contents must be valuable, so they escape with it and flee to [[New Orleans]]. When Van Helsing discovers that the coffin has been stolen, he boards a plane to America, telling his apprentice, Simon Sheppard, to remain in London. Simon does not follow these instructions and follows his mentor.  Aboard the plane, one of the thieves manages to open the coffin, revealing the dormant body of [[Count Dracula]]. Dracula awakens and attacks the thieves, causing the plane to crash in the [[Louisiana]] swamps. Dracula survives the crash and travels to New Orleans, where college students Mary Heller and Lucy Westerman are living. Mary is estranged from her family and has recently been plagued by dreams of a strange, terrifying man.  Van Helsing and Simon arrive in New Orleans and destroy the newly turned vampires left in Dracula's wake. Afterwards, Van Helsing reveals to Simon that he is in fact the original Abraham Van Helsing, who defeated Dracula in 1897. Because he was unable to destroy Dracula permanently, Van Helsing hid the body and prolonged his own life with regular injections of Dracula's blood filtered via [[leech]]es until, one day, he could discover a way to kill Dracula for good. Simon is intrigued by Dracula's hatred of all things [[Christian]] and wonders why he is also particularly vulnerable to silver. Van Helsing also tells Simon about his daughter, Mary, who was taken from England by her mother after the truth about his identity came to light. Since Mary was conceived after Van Helsing began his injections, she shares blood and a [[Telepathy|telepathic]] link with Dracula, who senses her existence and is in New Orleans to find her.  Van Helsing and Simon try to reach Mary before Dracula does, but fail to do so before Dracula turns Lucy into a vampire. Dracula and his three new brides, Solina, Lucy, and Valerie (a news reporter bitten after the plane crash), corner Van Helsing and kill him. Simon and Mary escape, only to be captured by Dracula shortly thereafter. On a rooftop, Dracula transforms Mary and in the process reveals his secret: he is none other than the Apostle [[Judas Iscariot]], who betrayed [[Jesus]] for a bribe of thirty pieces of silver. As he went to hang himself, the rope snapped and as punishment he was cursed to live for two thousand years as a vampire. The three brides appear with Simon, and Dracula tells Mary to bite him. However, Mary takes the opportunity to save Simon's life by faking the bite instead. Then, together Mary and Simon kill the three brides. Angered by this, Dracula tries to throw her from the rooftop. Mary wraps some cable from a large crucifix around Dracula's neck and they both fall from the roof. Dracula hangs as he attempted to do two thousand years before, but this time the rope does not break, and he burns in the first sunlight.  Mary survives the fall and is cured of her vampirism by Dracula saying “I release you” before he dies in the Sun. In the end, she is doubting of whether the sun has truly killed Dracula. She returns him to the vault beneath Carfax Abbey and vows to watch over his ashes should he ever rise again. Her vampirism isn't completely cured as her eyes briefly turned red again.  
Drowning Mona
 The film's first scene shows Mona Dearly ([[Bette Midler]]) leaving her home and trying in vain to unlock her car. Her keys fit her son's car, so she takes that and drives off. In a bend, the brakes fail completely and she drives off a cliff into the [[Hudson River]]. This is observed by Clarence, who is fishing there. Chief Wyatt Rash ([[Danny DeVito]]) later observes that there are no skid marks on the road.  Neither her husband Phil ([[William Fichtner]]) nor Jeph (her son) seem upset when they hear about Mona's death and they are not the only ones. Ellie (Wyatt's daughter) even wants to celebrate, because she feels the Dearlys have always treated Bobby (her fiancé and Jeph's business partner) very badly. JB Landscaping is not doing well because of Jeph's laziness and poor behavior. Bobby denies that he still wants to fire Jeph and that he has a problem with the Dearlys.  Phil and Rona ([[Jamie Lee Curtis]]), who are having an affair, meet at the Charm Motel. Phil expresses his happiness about Mona's death but denies involvement. Bobby meets Murph, his older brother. Due to his financial difficulties, Bobby has been receiving money from Murph, who thinks he had a hand in Mona's death. Wyatt's investigation takes him to Jeph, who claims that Bobby threatened and attacked Mona. Lucinda, the local mechanic specializing in the Yugo (which everyone in town drives) informs Wyatt that the car that Mona was driving (Jeph's car) had been tampered with in multiple ways.  Phil tells Wyatt that he was a battered husband, Mona having hit him after having accused him of having an affair. He also claims that Jeph and Mona had had an argument on the evening before the accident. Bobby tells Wyatt that he hated Mona and that they had had an argument over Jeph's pay. Mona would not let him dissolve the partnership. Phil and Jeph leave Mona's wake very early. Meanwhile, Wyatt breaks into the Dearly's and finds out that Mona's and Jeph's car keys have been switched. Phil expresses his gratitude to Bobby for killing Mona. Bobby then confesses to Ellie that he rigged Jeph's car, because Jeph was destroying their business. Ellie then announces that she is pregnant. This conversation is overheard by Clarence.  Phil tells Wyatt that he spotted Bobby near the Dearly residence on the night prior to the accident, claiming that he did not say this earlier because Wyatt and Bobby are soon to be family. Jeph, who it turns out is ''also'' involved with Rona, finds out about Phil's affair with her. Bobby tells Wyatt that Mona threatened him, not the other way around, and that he was in the Hideaway the evening before the accident, which as Valerie tells Wyatt is not true. Murph later tries to cover Bobby on this. Valerie also gives him a sharp gardening tool with the letters "JB" on it.  Phil is discovered dead in a pond at the Charm Motel. Murph tells this to Ellie, who fears that Bobby, who left their house that night, has killed again. When Rona finds out, she tries to leave town. A flashback shows Jeph not helping Phil when he fell into the water after Phil threatened Jeph that he was going to expose Jeph, Rona, and Bobby.  The police learn that Jeph is threatening suicide because of Rona's leaving. Jeph also states that Phil was not his real father and that Mona chopped off his right hand when they fought over a bottle of beer, but that in spite of all this he did not kill either of them. Wyatt manages to take the gun away from Jeph.  Wyatt then tells Bobby in private that Clarence confessed to killing Phil, because he could not stand the idea of Bobby going to jail, especially with the baby on the way. A flashback shows Clarence watching Phil, who had seen Bobby rig the car, tamping with it some more and then switching the keys in the house. The tampering by Bobby was superficial and did not contribute to the accident.  Wyatt promises Bobby to keep quiet about Bobby's involvement as long as he takes good care of Ellie and the baby. In the final scene, Bobby and Ellie get married and Clarence gets taken away.

Dragonheart: A New Beginning
 One year before his death, Sir Bowen visits the cave-home of his long-dead [[dragon]] friend Draco, and there finds an egg. He takes the egg to a [[monastery]] where his friend Brother Gilbert, an eccentric and virtuous [[monk]], lives. The [[friar]]s at the monastery pledge to hide the dragon away, with Friar Peter ([[John Woodnutt]]) protecting him and teaching him for 20 years. The task of taking care of the dragon is passed to a young and grumpy but just friar named Mansel (Matt Hickey).  An orphaned stable boy named Geoff ([[Christopher Masterson]]), who dreams of one day becoming a knight like Bowen, lives at the monastery, doing menial chores; he tricks Mansel into manual labor and finds the hidden Drake, the dragon (voiced by [[Robby Benson]]). At first Geoff is afraid, but realizes Drake is more afraid of him. They soon form a friendship.  Meanwhile, two [[Chinese people|Chinese citizens]] ([[Henry O]] and Rona Figueroa), appearing to be a frail old man and apprentice, enter the kingdom and ask Friar Peter if he knows anything about dragons, as there is a [[prophecy]] stating that "a dragon's heart will doom mankind when a two-tailed [[comet]] blazes across the night sky".  The comet will come in a matter of days, so they want to make sure that there are either no dragons around, or, if there is one, confirm that its heart is pure and that it will not be tempted into fulfilling the prophecy.  Meanwhile, the King ([[Ken Shorter]]) makes a mysterious man named Osric (Harry Van Gorkum) his adviser, and Osric pledges to unite the kingdom under the old code, but corrupts it by forcing each status of citizen to wear a certain color of tunic.  While Geoff is complaining about this new law, he and Drake are surprised by some bullies, and Drake is forced to take his first flight. During this, the two Chinese learn of Drake's existence and, after using a test to check his heart's purity, start to train him to use his dragon abilities, including fire-breathing, flight, using his tail, claws, and teeth, and to exhale ice breath, the last of which is a rare skill that few dragons manage to master. Before this time of teaching, Geoff discovers that the Chinese grandson is the princess of China in disguise, who reveals that dragons once abetted mankind until a renegade dragon named Griffin betrayed the dragon's code of honour and killed humans until virtuous dragons took his heart and defeated him. Fearing that all dragons were akin to Griffin, the Chinese emperor ordered the killing of every dragon in the country, so that Drake is the last dragon in the world.  The Chinese citizens are captured and Geoff is made a knight for his friendship with Drake. Osric takes them to battle a group of rebels where a fight engages, during which Osric fakes a fatal blow and asks Drake to give him half his heart. Realizing that the attempt is a trick, Geoff rallies Drake in an escape. Drake masters his fire-breathing skills for the first time. At the castle, Osric recognizes a familiar box. Master Kwan, the elder Chinese, recognizes Osric's true identity and orders the amulet burned. Osric recovers the box and discovers his lost heart. Out of revenge for her ancestor's slaying of the dragons, Osric throws a [[knife]] at Master Kwan's companion Lian, but Kwan intervenes and dies.  Geoff and Drake arrive, and as the comet comes into view, Osric reveals himself as Griffin, whose heart was cut out by the virtuous dragons and imprisoned as a human for his crimes. Lian carried his heart with her to protect it. When he recovers possession of his heart, he resumes his dragon form and asks Drake to join him in the conquest of mankind. Recalling how Griffin would have cost him his soul if Geoff had not intervened, Drake refuses and challenges Griffin. After a short but fierce dragon fight, Drake uses his ice breath to freeze Griffin to death. Geoff is injured by a piece of ice lodged in his heart; so Drake offers a piece of his own, securing his place in the constellation Draco. The old code is restored and Lian returns to her royal duties for a time.  Mansel is awarded guardianship of Brother Gilbert's scrolls and has a life of prayer and devotion. Geoff and Drake go on to become brothers, having discovered the familial bond that is all they ever truly wanted.  
Drôle de Félix

While cleaning out the apartment of his recent deceased mother, he discovers that the father he never knew is living in [[Marseilles]]. Félix decides to hitchhike south to meet him, promising to see his lover Daniel there five days later.  Carrying with him only a small bag, his HIV medication and a rainbow [[kite]], Félix takes to the road. He witnesses a racist attack and is beaten up by one of the assailants. He is unable, however, to bring himself to report it to the police.

As he calls each of these characters "brother", "cousin", "grandmother" and the like, he gradually constructs a sort of family and new understandings of life through this [[odyssey]], no matter whether he actually meets his "true" father at the end of the story.  Félix is haunted by the racist crime he witnessed, in which he learns, the victim died, and in his inability to do anything about it. Stopping at a hotel, he sees the police arresting the murderer. When he arrives at Marseilles, Felix decides not to see his father and goes instead on a romantic holiday to [[Tunisia]] with his lover.

Dungeons & Dragons (film)
 The Empire of Izmir has long been a divided land, ruled by the Mages, an elite group of magic users. An evil mage named Profion ([[Jeremy Irons]]) creates a sceptre that can allow him to control Gold dragons, but his attempt to control a captive one fails, and he is forced to kill it. As he begins to make new plans, the dragon bleeds into the river, causing it to catch fire, which many inhabitants notice, including a pair of thieves, Ridley ([[Justin Whalin]]) and Snails ([[Marlon Wayans]]).  Later, Profion and the Council talk about the controversial views of Empress Savina ([[Thora Birch]]), who wants to give rights to non-mages in Izmir. As she is still mastering her own control over Gold Dragons, she considers seeking the Rod of Savrille, a sceptre that controls Red dragons. Profion learns of this and decides to take the sceptre himself. Meanwhile, Ridley and Snails break into the magic school to steal valuables, but are caught by Marina ([[Zoe McLellan]]). She is distracted when the Library wizard is held hostage and interrogated by Profion's henchmen, Damodar ([[Bruce Payne]]) for information on the map to the sceptre. After refusing to talk, Damodar kills him. Marina gets the map and travels through a portal to escape, accidentally taking the thieves with her. After crashing into a pile of garbage, they meet a dwarf named Elwood ([[Lee Arenberg]]), who ends up joining Ridley, Snails and Marina escaping through the sewer.  Damodar puts a price on Marina, Ridley, Snails and Elwood's heads and, after letting Profion know that the protagonists got away with the map, Profion creates a tentacled monster inside Damodar's head. The protagonists hide in a [[tavern]] and read the map that Ridley and Marina get sucked into. Damodar and his henchmen attack Elwood and Snails, but they manage to get away with the map. Ridley and Marina exit the map and all decide to work together to find the sceptre. They have to find a ruby called the "Eye of the Dragon" that can open the door to a tomb where the sceptre rests. The ruby is located in a den of thieves that is led by Xilus ([[Richard O'Brien]]) who'll give the protagonists the "Eye of the Dragon" if Ridley solves a maze of booby traps. Ridley manages to get the "Eye of the Dragon" when Damodar arrives to capture him and his friends. Marina is captured while Ridley, Snails and Elwood escape, meeting an elf named Norda ([[Kristen Wilson (actress)|Kristen Wilson]]) who works for Empress Savina and informs the Empress about Profion's plan to get the sceptre. Meanwhile, Damodar interrogates Marina, using the tentacles in his head to gain her knowledge.  Ridley and Snails break into the castle to rescue Marina, while Norda and Elwood stay behind. Ridley and Snails split up and Ridley finds Marina, but Snails is confronted and killed by Damodar when he throws the map to his comrades. Ridley becomes enraged at Damodar and attacks him, but Damodar disarms him and stabs him in the left shoulder with his own sword. In the confusion Marina grabs some magic dust and uses a magic portal to escape with Ridley, leaving the corpse of Snails behind. During the council meeting, Profion and Empress Savina battle over the domination of Izmir.  Meanwhile, an elf ([[Tom Baker]]) heals Norda's soldiers and Ridley, and Marina tries to help Ridley get over the death of Snails, but Ridley angrily rebukes her. After an argument in which Marina convinces Ridley that Snails didn't die in vain, they become [[love interest]]s. Ridley uses the "Eye of the Dragon" to finally get the sceptre, which is held by a skeleton in the tomb that comes to life and warns Ridley that "anyone who wields the power of the rod shall suffer a horrible fate", but Damodar arrives to steal the sceptre and brings it to Profion, where Ridley, Marina, Norda and Elwood follow.  They travel back to the Empress' castle where Gold dragons controlled by the Empress are battling the Mages following Profion below. Profion removes the monster from Damodar's head and uses the sceptre to summon Red dragons, which battle the Gold dragons and slowly begin to win the fight. Ridley comes across Damodar, duels him with his new magic sword and then kills him, sending his body off the castle wall. He then attacks Profion, who disarms him and shoves him back. Ridley's companions arrive and fight Profion one at a time. Ridley picks up the fallen sceptre, and uses it to stop the red dragons. Marina encourages Ridley to use the sceptre to bring Profion down, but Ridley, realizing the sceptre's power will corrupt him, refuses and destroys it. With Profion's plans completely falling apart, Empress Savina arrives and condemns Profion, who fights her with powerful magic, but she succeeds in summoning a Gold dragon to eat Profion.  Ridley later visits Snails's grave with Norda, Marina and Elwood. When he places the "Eye of the Dragon" on the grave, Snails' engraved name disappears, and Norda tells Ridley not to question his abilities. Norda then uses the "Eye of the Dragon" to teleport Ridley to a place where "your friend awaits you", along with herself, Marina and Elwood.  
Dude, Where's My Car?
 Jesse and Chester awaken with hangovers and no memory of the previous night. The television is on, showing an [[Animal Planet]] program about how [[Tool use by animals|animals use twigs and rocks as tools to get food]]. Their refrigerator is filled with containers of chocolate [[pudding]], and the answering machine contains an angry message from their twin girlfriends Wilma and Wanda as to their whereabouts. They emerge from their home to find Jesse's car missing, and with it their girlfriends' first-anniversary presents. This prompts Jesse to ask the film's titular question: "Dude, where's my car?"  Because the girls have promised them a "special treat", which Jesse and Chester take to mean sex, the men are desperate to retrieve their car. The duo begins retracing their steps in an attempt to discover where they left the car. Along the way, they encounter a [[transgender]] stripper, a belligerent speaker box operator at a Chinese restaurant's drive-through (voiced by Freda Foh Shen), two appropriately-worded tattoos they discover on each other's backs, UFO cultists led by Zoltan (who later hold the twins hostage), a [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]]-speaking Chinese tailor, the [[Zen]]-minded Nelson and his [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-loving dog, the attractive Christie Boner, the aggressive jock Tommy (who is the boyfriend of Christie) and his friends, a couple of hard-nosed police detectives, and a reclusive [[France|French]] [[ostrich]] farmer named Pierre. They also meet two groups of aliens, one group being five gorgeous women, the other being two [[Norway|Norwegian]] men, searching for the "Continuum Transfunctioner"; a device whose mystery is exceeded only by its power, that the boys accidentally picked up last night.  After Pierre releases the duo after they answered a question about ostriches correctly, Jesse and Chester head over to a local arcade named Captain Stu's Space-O-Rama. Once inside, they encounter Zoltan and his cultists who give them Wilma and Wanda in exchange for the Continuum Transfunctioner (which is a toy that Jesse and Chester tried to pass off as the Transfunctioner); Tommy, Christie, and the jocks arrive along with Nelson and his dog (whom they release after Tommy snatches the fake Transfunctioner from Zoltan).  The two sets of aliens arrive and notify of the ''real'' Continuum Transfunctioner: a [[Rubik's Cube]] that Chester has been working hard to solve, and eventually does (thus activating it). They are warned that once the five lights stop flashing, the universe will be destroyed.  Jesse and Chester must determine which of two sets of aliens is entitled to the device. One of the groups is there to protect the universe, the other is there to destroy it. Both claim to be the protectors of the universe, stating that they were with Jesse and Chester the previous night (which Jesse and Chester still cannot remember) and ask for the Transfunctioner. The two correctly choose the men, because when the men were asked what they did the night before, they correctly respond that they got a hole in one at the 18th hole at the arcade's [[miniature golf]] park, and won a lifetime supply of pudding. At the last second, they deactivate the Transfunctioner, saving the universe.  Thwarted, the five alien women merge to become a [[giantess]] who swallows Tommy alive. The giantess then crawls out of the amusement center and chases Jesse and Chester. The cultists tell them to activate the Photon Accelerator Annihilation Beam on the Transfunctioner. However, the button that activates it is too far in to reach. At the last second, Chester remembers the nature show with the tool-using chimps and uses a straw to push the recessed button, thus destroying the alien (Tommy survives, but Christie breaks up with him in favor of Nelson). The protectors thank Jesse, Chester and the twins for saving the world, and erase their minds concerning the events. The protectors park the duo's car, a [[Renault 5|Renault Le Car]], behind a mail truck for them to find the following morning. Jesse and Chester salvage their relationships with the twins and discover the special treat from the girls turns out to be matching knitted caps and scarves. The protectors leave a gift for their girlfriends (and, for the two men): [[Breast implant|Breast Enhancement]] Necklaces.  The film ends with Jesse, Chester, and the twins going in Jesse's car out for Chinese food while arguing what the tattoo said on each other's back.  
Duets (film)
 The story revolves around unrelated pairs of people who spend time in [[karaoke]] bars across the [[United States]] in the week leading up to a big contest in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]]. *Ricky Dean ([[Huey Lewis]]) is a [[hustling|hustler]] on the karaoke circuit. He travels from town to town feigning ambivalence of karaoke, then winning both the contests and side bets with locals. He is detoured by a phone call and travels to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] for the [[funeral]] of an ex-girlfriend; while there, he meets his daughter Liv ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]), with whom he hasn't made contact with for many years. Seeking a father figure after the death of her mother, Liv joins him against his wishes on the road, both singing solos at karaoke bars. They are involved in a bar fight when one of Ricky's [[Glossary of cue sports terms#mark|marks]] retaliates. *[[Depression (mood)|Depressed]] California salesman Todd Woods ([[Paul Giamatti]]) is so exhausted from business travel that he doesn't even know what city he's in; when he gets home, his wife Candy ([[Kiersten Warren]]) and two children are too self-absorbed to even say hello. Bored, he walks out on his family and his old life, driving aimlessly. He wanders into a karaoke bar in [[New Mexico]], where a fellow participant offers [[beta blockers]] to help him overcome his [[anxiety]] and [[stage fright]]. Todd gets hooked on the drugs as he keeps driving. In [[Utah]], he picks up hitchhiker Reggie Kane ([[Andre Braugher]]), a charismatic but violent [[fugitive]] convict, who has already robbed a truck driver who gave him a lift at gunpoint. The two form an unlikely friendship after Reggie reveals a beautiful singing voice during a duet at another karaoke bar. Todd's mental health deteriorates further as Reggie tries to keep him out of trouble; he first has to drag Todd out of a hotel when he threatens the clerk with a gun; then, after Todd causes a standoff at a service station, Reggie shoots and kills the attendant. Reggie arranges for Candy to meet them in Omaha, but an emotionless Todd rejects her, insisting he is finished with his former life. *[[Cincinnati]]-based [[Slacker|underachieving]] cab driver and onetime aspiring priest Billy ([[Scott Speedman]]) goes on a drinking binge after catching his partner cheating on him. He meets Suzi Loomis ([[Maria Bello]]), a [[Homelessness|broke]] [[Vagrancy (people)|drifter]] who gets by on karaoke contest prizes and sexual favors. Neither respects the other's lifestyle, but Billy  nonetheless agrees to drive her to [[California]], stopping at karaoke bars for Suzi to compete along the way.  All three pairs end up at the Omaha contest, each having won the right to compete there for $5,000 by virtue of winning in a smaller town. Finally accepting his daughter, Ricky invites her to perform a duet of her mother's favourite song, [[Cruisin' (Smokey Robinson song)#Gwyneth Paltrow and Huey Lewis version|Cruisin']]. Billy discovers that Suzi's confidence is fake when he finds her in the ladies' room, vomiting from stage fright, but he convinces her to compete. Reggie sees the police arrive, investigating the service station shooting. He performs an [[a cappella]] version of [[Free Bird]] before pulling a gun on stage, prompting police to shoot him; this gives Todd a chance to put the full blame for the service station shooting on Reggie, which frees Todd to return his old life.  After the contest, Billy and Suzi continue on their way to California. Billy invites Liv (with whom he had been flirting with at the contest) and Ricky to join them, and they resolve to take a slight detour to another karaoke contest in [[Nevada]].

Dust to Dust (2000 film)
 The movie opens as the two protagonists, Rodrigo and Rocco join their families to hold a birthday party for their grandfather, Rodrigo Carnicero, which through most of the movie is only referred to as "El abuelo" (Spanish for ''Grandpa''). Rodrigo is a regular middle-class teenager, while Rocco (who, in fact, is also named Rodrigo but shortens his name to Rocco) is rather more unconventional, a [[marijuana]] user and writer for an independent magazine, and has deep conflicts with his father Luis.  Despite being cousins and the best efforts of the grandfather, Rodrigo and Rocco have a troubled relationship and are constantly harsh to each other. During the meal, the boys' parents (the sons of Carnicero) talk about the grandfather's [[will (law)|will]] and the upcoming marriage of Luis. After a furious fight with Luis, Carnicero suffers a [[heart attack]] and dies.  After Carnicero's death, the family goes into conflict about the terms of his will, which grants money to a longtime friend even when Luis and his brother claim he does not have a right to anything as he is not related to Carnicero, the fact that Rodrigo inherited his grandfather's car, and the expenses of running the big house where he lived. After a [[funeral mass]], held despite the desire Carnicero stated in his will, Rocco realizes his father and uncles are not willing to fulfill the other petition on the will: to have his ashes thrown into the sea at sunrise, in Acapulco, and decides to do it on his own.  After stealing Rodrigo's car, Rocco talks his cousin into joining him in the trip. Despite the movie title, they do not drive by the [[Mexican Federal Highway|free highway]] but by the [[List of Mexican autopistas|autopista]], where they have to pay tolls. By the time they arrive in Acapulco, they're almost out of money. Then starts a recurring event in the movie, where the boys [[spin the bottle|spin]] the funerary [[urn]] to solve a disagreement, under the idea of "letting grandpa choose", in this case, to decide whether visiting Rodrigo's girlfriend Irina or Grandpa's friend Felipe to borrow money. The outcome leads them to visit Felipe in his restaurant, where they get a loan and Rocco notices an attractive girl who just left a bunch of flyers advertising a hotel. Rocco takes one of the flyers and they rent a room in the hotel.  Then they disagree about the plans for the night: Rodrigo wants to go a disco with Irina and Rocco wants to take the ashes to a [[cantina]]. The urn-spinning game is used again to decide, and Rodrigo wins. As he is leaving with Irina, he convinces Rocco (who does not have a date) to invite the girl from the hotel, Maria, to the disco. There, Rocco gets bored as he cannot dance, and out of boredom tastes the ashes, which makes Rodrigo take the urn to the dance floor where it gets misplaced. After recovering the urn, he and Maria go to a coffee shop and talk, discovering they have a lot in common and like each other. Returning to the hotel, they have sex.  At the same time, Rodrigo and Irina get back from the disco, but they find the hotel room locked and neither of them has money to rent another. They decide to have sex in Rodrigo's car, but are caught by the police and Rodrigo is arrested. He calls Rocco, who uses his remaining money to bribe an officer and take him out of detention. By then, it's morning, so the boys take the urn and go to the beach, but they find out the ashes have been replaced by [[corn chips]]. They engage in a fight, each blaming the other for the loss, and return to the disco to search for the ashes, but there the garbage has already been thrown out.  In Mexico City, Rodrigo and Rocco's Aunt, Pureza, discovers the ashes are missing. She and Rodrigo's father (also named Rodrigo) leave Mexico City right away to Acapulco, while Luis stays in Mexico City.  Back in the hotel room, Rocco discovers a small amount of grey powder on the floor, which he claims tastes like the ashes, and both deduce Maria has taken them, as she stayed in the room while Rocco was getting Rodrigo out of jail. At Maria's house, right next to the hotel, they look at her family pictures and discover Maria is Rodrigo Carnicero's illegitimate daughter, and therefore their aunt. She confronts them and refuses to give back the ashes, forcing them to leave, and then at request of her mother, Perla (who had been Carnicero's lover) explains to her what happened.  Maria and Perla decide to bury the ashes (stolen by Maria in a corn chip bag, which is why the corn chips were in the urn) in their garden, but on second thought, divide them in two, and decide to bury one half in the garden and give the other to the boys so they can throw it in the sea.  Out of rage and shocked by the revelation, Rodrigo slams the car he inherited from his grandfather, but he and Rocco end up coming to terms with Perla and Maria's decision and accept the half they are given. Rocco gives Maria a watch (left to him by Carnicero in his will, and named as his most beloved possession) and they kiss again, despite knowing they are related, while Rocco builds a warm friendship with Perla. Knowing the visit to Acapulco has been quite eventful, and fearing they'll lose the rest of the ashes, they spin the urn one last time, to decide whether to throw the ashes on sunrise or sunset. Sunset wins.  On the dock, Rocco, Rodrigo and Maria meet with Pureza and Rodrigo Sr., but his father fights with Rodrigo about the almost destroyed car, only to discover Rodrigo has matured and stands up to him. Finally, he stays on the dock, and only the three youths and Pureza board the ship. Pureza sees that Maria has the watch, deducing the relation between her and her father, and Rodrigo and Rocco are shown to have built a bond, supporting each other. The movie closes when all four say goodbye to Carnicero and throw the ashes.

Masry|Ed Masry]], expects to win, but Erin's explosive courtroom behavior under [[cross-examination]] loses her the case, and Ed will not return her phone calls afterwards. One day, he arrives at work to find her in the office, apparently working. She says that he told her things would work out and they did not, and that she needed a job. Ed takes pity on Erin, and she gets a paid job at the office.  Erin is given files for a real estate case where the [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] (PG&E) is offering to purchase the home of Donna Jensen, a resident of [[Hinkley, California]]. Erin is surprised to see medical records in the file and visits Donna, who explains that she had simply kept all her PG&E correspondence together. Donna appreciates PG&E's help: she has had several tumors and her husband has [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], but PG&E has always supplied a doctor at their own expense. Erin asks why they would do that, and Donna replies, "because of the chromium". Erin begins digging into the case and finds evidence that the groundwater in Hinkley is seriously contaminated with carcinogenic [[hexavalent chromium]], but PG&E has been telling Hinkley residents that they use a safer form of chromium. After several days away from the office doing this research, she is fired by Ed until he realizes that she was working all the time, and sees what she has found out.  Rehired, she continues her research, and over time, visits many Hinkley residents and wins their trust. She finds many cases of tumors and other medical problems in Hinkley. Everyone has been treated by PG&E's doctors and thinks the cluster of cases is just a coincidence, unrelated to the "safe" chromium. The Jensens' claim for compensation grows into a major [[class action]] lawsuit, but the direct evidence only relates to PG&E's Hinkley plant, not to the senior management.  Knowing that PG&E could slow any settlement for years through delays and appeals, Ed takes the opportunity to arrange for disposition by binding arbitration, but a large majority of the plaintiffs must agree to this. Erin returns to Hinkley and persuades all 634 plaintiffs to go along. While she is there, a man named Charles Embry approaches her to say that he and his cousin were PG&E employees, but his cousin recently died from the poison. The man says he was tasked with destroying documents at PG&E, but, "as it turns out," he "wasn't a very good employee".  Embry gives Erin the documents, which include a 1966 memo proving corporate headquarters knew the water was contaminated with hexavalent chromium, did nothing about it, and advised the Hinkley operation to keep this secret. The judge orders PG&E to pay a settlement amount of $333 million to be distributed among the plaintiffs.  In the aftermath, Ed hands Erin her bonus payment for the case but warns her he has changed the amount. She explodes into a complaint that she deserves more respect, but is astonished to find that he has increased it—to $2 million.

An Everlasting Piece
 Colm (Barry McEvoy) takes a job as a barber in a Belfast psychiatric hospital. He meets the staff and is warned against talking about poetry with George, a fellow barber (Brían F. O'Byrne). When he brings it up, George subjects him to his own poor work, but the pair chat anyway. Later, they meet an orderly escorting a new patient, whom he refers to as "The Scalper" (Billy Connolly), described as the only seller of hair pieces in all of [[Northern Ireland]] until he had a nervous breakdown and scalped some of his own customers. Colm and George decide to meet with the Scalper to gain his list of customers; they intend to take over his former hairpiece monopoly. The Scalper agrees to give them the list.  Colm and George, calling themselves "The Piece People", embark on their plan to get rich. Colm's girlfriend Bronagh (Anna Friel) helps. She sets up their first appointment with a Mr Black (Des McAleer), who eventually agrees to buy a hairpiece, although he denies having been a customer of "The Scalper". Bronagh had seen his picture in the newspaper (featured after he shot a Catholic) and, as he was bald, thought he'd be a good prospect. Having little success in sales, Colm and George discover they have competition from "Toupée or not Toupée", rivals who also acquired the client list. The supplier, "Wigs Of Wimbledon", decides to hold a meeting with two companies to inform them that the one who sells the most in a given time period will win an exclusive rights for all of Northern Ireland. The partners visit a farmer but lose the sale, learning that their competitors are underselling them. On a remote road, they are stopped by members of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), demanding to know what they are up to. This confrontation results in the partners selling a wig to the lead IRA man (Colum Convey), who fails to notice it had been chewed by dogs.  The competition is raging, but the IRA man accidentally leaves the unique wig at the scene of a bombing. The [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) trace it to The Piece People. After being interrogated, George and Colm have a falling-out. Meanwhile, the IRA man who lost the wig tracks Colm down and demands Colm sell him his whole inventory because now every bald Catholic in Northern Ireland is a potential suspect for the police. Colm refuses as his business partner is a Protestant and thinks it would be unethical to protect the IRA because the sales would likely help The Piece People win the exclusive deal with Wigs Of Wimbledon.  Colm goes to a poetry reading by George, and the two make peace. With the help of Bronagh, the duo learn that many British Army soldiers in Northern Ireland are suffering from [[alopecia]] (hair loss) due to the stressful conditions, and secure a government contract to supply wigs to all soldiers who want them. With this, they win the competition and gain the rights to Northern Ireland.  
Essex Boys
 The film is based loosely around events in December 1995 that culminated in the [[Rettendon murders]] of three drug dealers in Rettendon, Essex, UK.  
The Envy of Gods
 In the "[[History (Herodotus)|History]]" [[Herodotus]] says, "The gods do not like happy people". In ancient times, people knew why they can not demonstrate their good fortune and happiness: it can cause jealousy and anger of the gods, because they believed that happiness is their, gods, privilege, and daring people who want the same thing, should be punished.  The film takes place in early autumn 1983 in Moscow, in an atmosphere of acute [[cold war]] (including the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|war in Afghanistan]], the [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007|incident with the South Korean "Boeing"]], etc.).  The main heroine of the picture Sonia ([[Vera Alentova]]) is an editor in television, she has a son, a graduate of the school, and her husband Sergei ([[Aleksandr Feklistov]]) is a quite successful Soviet writer. One day to visit them a Frenchman Bernard ([[Gérard Depardieu]]) comes, whom Sergei met while working on a book about the [[French Resistance]], accompanied by a French translator of Russian descent named André (Anatoly Lobotsky). André also has a family in [[Paris]]. However, this meeting turns their lives upside down. André falls in love with Sonia at first sight and emphatically tries to get a new meeting with her. Sonia, a faithful wife, educated in the Soviet tradition of chastity, at first refuses; moreover employees of Soviet television are not allowed to enter in unsupervised contact with foreigners. But André still gets his way, and Sonia also is also overtaken by a violent passion. She discovers such strong feelings about the possibility of which she previously did not know. For a few days of their lives Sonia and Andre are absolutely happy. But they soon have to separate because their countries belong to different worlds, divided by the [[Iron Curtain]].

Meanwhile, Goofy's [[empty nest syndrome]] causes him to falter at work, causing a massive explosion inside at the assembly toy factory and getting him fired. The unemployment office reveals that he needs a college degree to get another job, and since Goofy dropped out of college after three years, he is forced to return to college to finish his fourth year, coming to Max's college with his 70's university clothes.

Tank tries winning in Bradley's place, which angers Bradley into making our trio crash into the inflatable X-games logo ship, though they escape the wreckage. Max wins by a nose, while Tank slingshots Bradley into the X Games [[blimp]] overhead.

Faithless (2000 film)
 An aging director named Bergman conjures in his imagination the central character, Marianne. Over a period of days, on his secluded [[Fårö]] refuge in the Baltic Sea, he interviews her to compose the story of her life-changing affair. She had been happily married to Markus, an orchestra conductor, with a young daughter Isabelle. She suddenly falls in love with their best friend David. They have an extended interlude in Paris and then must deal with the ramifications. The style of the film is very cerebral, abstract, and ambiguous.   
Faat Kiné
 After two pregnancies out of wedlock, Faat Kiné has earned a place for herself as a successful gas station owner in patriarchal Senegalaise society, raising her two children alone and providing fully for their needs.  After passing their baccalaureates, Faat Kiné's children, Djip and Aby, try to fix their mother up with Uncle Jean, a Christian businessman, who outwardly objects because Kiné is Muslim, but is actually pursuing her.  Throughout the film, Kiné reminisces about her life. She was very close to getting her own baccalauréat when she was impregnated by one of her professors. She was subsequently expelled and disowned by her father. Angered at the shame Kine brought on their family, he even attempted to burn her but her mother shielded her; surviving with severe burn scars on her back. Kiné later started working at a gas station as an attendant to support herself. Only a few years after her first pregnancy, she became pregnant again and was abandoned by her fiance who took her life savings and tried to flee the country.  Since then, Faat Kiné has been successful; buying a house for herself, her two children, and her mother.  Back in the present, Kiné is very happy when her children present her their baccalauréat diplomas.  At the party to celebrate the graduates, Djip's father shows up, but Djip consistently refers to him as "Monsieur Boubacar Omar Payane, a.k.a. BOP" rather than "father." Aby's father, M. Gaye, also comes to the party, and she asks him to finance her college education.  Her father is offended and tells her to ask Kiné, despite the fact that it is Kiné who has raised Aby her whole life, while Gaye has given her no support.  After an altercation involving BOP, Gaye, and Djip, the two men are hooted out of the party.  At the end of the party, Djib and Aby are delighted to discover that Faat Kiné and Uncle Jean have become a couple, which they attribute to their matchmaking skills, but it is clear that Faat Kiné and Uncle Jean were attracted to each other from the beginning.  
Fail Safe (2000 film)
 The time is the early-to-mid-1960s, the height of the [[Cold War]] between the United States and the Soviet Union.  An unknown aircraft approaches North America from Europe.  American bombers of the [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) are scrambled to their [[fail safe]] points near Russia. The bombers have orders not to proceed past their fail safe points without receiving a special attack code. The original "threat" is proven to be innocuous and recall orders are issued.  However, due to a technical failure, the attack code is transmitted to Group Six, which consists of six Vindicator supersonic bombers and four escort fighters.  Colonel Grady, the commanding pilot of Group Six, tries to contact SAC headquarters in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] to verify the fail-safe order (called Positive Check), but due to Soviet radio jamming, Grady cannot hear Omaha.  Concluding that the attack order and the radio jamming could only mean [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], Grady commands Group Six towards [[Moscow]], their intended destination.  At meetings in Omaha, the Pentagon, and in the fallout shelter of the White House, American politicians and scholars debate the implications of the attack. Professor Groteschele suggests the United States follow this accidental attack with a [[Nuclear triad|full-scale attack]] to force the Soviets to surrender.  The President orders the Air Force to send the four escort fighters after the bombers to shoot down the Vindicators. The attempt is to show that the Vindicator attack is an accident, not a full-scale nuclear assault. After using their [[afterburner]]s in an attempt to catch the bombers  the fighters run out of fuel and crash, dooming the pilots to die of exposure in the [[Arctic Sea]]. The fighters fail to destroy any bombers.  The President of the United States contacts the Soviet Premier and offers assistance in attacking the group.  The Soviets decline at first; then they decide to accept help.  Meanwhile, the Soviet [[PVO Strany]] air defense corps has managed to shoot down two of the six planes.  After accepting American help they shoot down two more planes. Two bombers remain on course to Moscow. One is a decoy and carries no bombs. The other carries two 20 megaton devices. General Bogan tells Marshal Nevsky, the Soviet commander, to ignore the decoy plane because it is harmless. Nevsky, who mistrusts Bogan, instead orders his Soviet aircraft to pursue the decoy aircraft. The Russian fighters are then out of position to intercept the final American bomber. The decoy's feint guarantees that the remaining bomber can successfully attack. Following the failure, Nevsky collapses.  As the bomber approaches Moscow, Colonel Grady opens up the radio to contact SAC to inform them that they are about to make the strike.  As a last-minute measure, the Soviets fire a barrage of nuclear-tipped missiles to form a fireball in an attempt to knock the low-flying Vindicator out of the sky.  The bomber shoots up two decoy missiles, which successfully leads the Soviet missiles high in the air and Colonel Grady's plane survives.  With the radio open, the President attempts to persuade Grady that there is no war. Grady's son also attempts to convince him. Under standing orders that such a late recall attempt must be a Soviet trick, Grady ignores them. Grady tells his crew that "We're not just walking wounded, we're [[Walking ghost phase|walking dead]] men," due to radiation from the Soviet missiles. He intends to fly the aircraft over Moscow and detonate the bombs in the plane.  His co-pilot notes, "There's nothing to go home to." Meanwhile, the American president has ordered another American bomber to circle over [[New York City]] with 40-megaton payload, which should be dropped in case of the bombing of Moscow. The American ambassador in Moscow reports about the final moments of the Russian capital before being vaporized from the blast.  The American bomber receives an order to drop its bombs over New York City in order for the destruction of Moscow to be reciprocated and a Third World War avoided. It was earlier revealed that the American President's wife was in New York while the events of the film transpired, meaning she would be killed in the blast. The pilot of the American bomber, General Black, commits suicide with a lethal injection just after releasing the bombs.

Evil Things
 Five college students leave New York City for a weekend in the country, and 48&nbsp;hours later they vanished without a trace.  To celebrate Miriam's (Elyssa Mersdorf) birthday, Miriam's Aunt Gail (Gail Cadden) gives her use of a large country home in the [[Catskills]] for the weekend. Miriam invites her friends Cassy (Laurel Casillo), Mark (Morgan Hooper), Tanya (Torrey Weiss) and Leo (Ryan Maslyn) to join her to celebrate.  As an aspiring filmmaker, Leo brings his new video camera, hoping to create a short documentary of the weekend getaway. The five begin driving to the house. Whilst looking for a place to pull over because Tanya is carsick, the group notice they are being bothered by a dark red van whose driver incessantly honks his horn at them and overtakes them only to slow down in front of them. They pass the van and continue on. They stop at a small gas station where Cassy notices a dark red van pull in and slow down.  Spooked, the gang leave. As they are driving away, a girl from inside the gas station stops them to hand over a phone Cassy left in the bathroom. The group continue to Aunt Gail's home and are again tailed by the van. They stop at a diner and while eating, the van pulls into the diner parking lot and drives slowly by the window. Furious, Mark storms outside to confront the driver but he drives away when Mark gets too close.  The group eventually make it to the house and Aunt Gail comes to turn the power on and wish them a good night. The five surprise Miriam with a birthday cake and then party and drink with Leo filming the whole occasion.  The next day, the group take a hike to the snowy woods which they soon get lost in the dark. They hear noises that they can't identify, crackling sounds on their two-way-radio and branches snapping which scares them all into a run. They do eventually make it back to the house without further incident. Later when eating dinner, they receive phone calls with no one answering. A knock at the door is heard and Mark finds a video tape wrapped in brown paper on the front step.  The tape reveals that the group have been being secretly video taped since they were on the road, and are being stalked by the same person in the maroon van. There is footage of them at the gas station with the girl running out to give Cassy back her phone, and them at the diner when Mark attempted to confront the driver of the van, proving it is the same van who has been following them the whole time. Then the footage follows them to Aunt Gail's house and shows film taken through the windows of the group laughing and having fun, surprising Miriam with her birthday cake, and to their horror, the stalker inside the house filming them all as they slept.  The phone rings again with no answer, and then the line is cut. No one can get a signal on their cell phones. The group decide to leave but when they run out to the car they see that it is missing. A van pulls up in the driveway, scaring the group back into the house. As everyone tries to get a signal on their phones again, all the power in the house goes out. Miriam finally gets a signal on her phone and dials 9-1-1, but the call drops out.  Down the hall, the group hear a noise. Mark gets a knife and goes to investigate. He finds a two way radio that is on and crackling. The door suddenly shuts from the inside and Mark's cries of pain can be heard. Cassy bangs on the door and tries to open it, and then it opens just a crack which scares the group into running upstairs to hide.  Upstairs, the group see the van driving away from the house so they come back downstairs to leave. Leo gives the camera to Tanya and leads the way out, but once outside he sees something that makes him scream at the others to run back inside. Once inside, Tanya falls breaking the camera and all left is the audio sound of Tanya screaming and her and Leo's fate is left unknown.  On the video footage of the van outside, Miriam is shown to be running from the house. The van turns on its lights and creeps along to follow her. The van stops and the stalker gets out and chases a screaming Miriam into the woods.  Back inside the house, the other stalker is looking around the house for Cassy with his [[nightvision]] on the camera. He finds Cassy hiding behind a couch and, believing she is alone, creeping out wandering blindly around the home. The stalker follows her watching how far she will get. Cassy gets to the door but, it is pulled shut from the outside, and the camera man makes the same sound the group heard in the woods alerting Cassy of his presence. She screams as he then lunges out at her, and the camera freezes on Cassy's screaming face.  The view pulls back and shows to a dark room were the stalker is watching several videos on many monitors. As well as the stalkers footage, there is also the footage Leo shot implying the stalkers stole his camera.  The last piece of film shows the stalker with the camera in a park, surveying groups of friends. While looking around he spots another group of friends filming. He then follows them on their trip.  During the end credits the video of the stalker's movements are shown from the moment he first spotted the group on the highway, following them to the house, filming them through the windows and while they sleep. Many of the close up shots focus solely on Cassy.

 Jack Campbell is a single [[Wall Street]] executive living in [[New York City]]. He is in the midst of putting together a multibillion-dollar [[mergers and acquisitions|merger]] and has ordered an emergency meeting on [[Christmas Day]]. In his office, on Christmas Eve, he hears that his former girlfriend, Kate, called him after many years, which he disregards, uninterested.   On the way home he walks into a convenience store where a lottery contestant, Cash, has a winning ticket worth $238. The store clerk does not believe Cash, so Cash pulls out a gun to threaten him and Jack offers to buy the ticket to prevent any violence. Jack offers to help Cash. In return, Cash questions Jack, asking him if he is missing anything in his life. Jack says he has everything he needs. Cash tells Jack that actions have consequences and that Jack has brought whatever is coming on himself. A puzzled Jack returns to his penthouse and sleeps.  On Christmas Day, Jack wakes up in a suburban [[New Jersey]] bedroom with Kate and two children. He hurries back to his office and condo in New York, but his closest friends do not recognize him. Jack runs out to the street and encounters Cash driving Jack's [[Ferrari]]. Cash is revealed to be a guardian angel. Cash explains that Jack is experiencing a glimpse of an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] in order to learn a lesson. He advises Jack to take the time to learn whatever it is that he needs to learn.  Jack is living the life he could have had, had he stayed in the United States with his girlfriend. He has a modest family life, where he is a car tire salesman for Kate's father and Kate is a non-profit lawyer. Jack's young daughter realizes his secret, thinks he is an alien and decides to assist him in surviving his new life. Jack struggles to fit into the role of a family man, such as missing opening Christmas presents, flirting with a married woman and forgetting his anniversary. He begins to succeed in his life, bonding with his children, falling in love with his wife and working hard at his job.  At a chance meeting, he is offered a contract to work at the same investment firm from his real life, having impressed his former boss, Chairman Peter Lassiter, with his business savvy when Lassiter comes in for a tire change. His old mentor offers him a job, while formerly [[sycophant]]ic Alan Mintz is in Jack's old position, with an assertiveness he did not possess as a subordinate. While he is wowed by the potential salary and other complimentary extreme luxuries, Kate argues that they are very happy and they should be thankful for their life.  Having finally realized the true value of his new life, Jack again sees Cash, now a store clerk. He demands to stay in this life, but Cash informs him there is no choice: a glimpse, by definition, is an impermanent thing. That night, Jack tries to stay awake, but fails and wakes the "next day" to find himself in his wealthy former life, on Christmas Day. He forgoes closing the acquisition deal to intercept Kate, finding her moving out of a luxury townhouse before flying to [[Paris]]. Like Jack, she has focused on her career and has become a very wealthy [[corporate lawyer]]. She had only called him to return a box of his old possessions. He chases after her to the airport and describes the family they had in the alternate universe in an effort to win back her love. She agrees to talk over a cup of coffee before making a decision. The credits begin to roll as they talk animatedly over the coffee.

None of the passengers, except for Clear, believe Alex about his vision until the plane explodes on take off, killing the remaining passengers on board. Afterwards, the survivors are interrogated by two FBI agents, who believe that Alex had something to do with the explosion.  Thirty-nine days later, the survivors attend a memorial service for the victims. That night, a chain reaction causes Tod to be strangled to death in his bathroom. His death is deemed a suicide, but Alex does not believe that Tod killed himself. To see Tod's body, he and Clear sneak into the funeral home, where they meet [[mortician]] [[William Bludworth]] ([[Tony Todd]]). He tells them that they have thwarted Death and that Death is now taking the lives of those who were meant to die on the plane.  The next day, at a café, Alex and Clear discuss what the mortician said. Although Clear is skeptical, Alex believes that they can cheat Death again if they look out for [[omen]]s. They encounter the rest of the survivors; and, when Carter provokes Alex, Terry storms off in anger and is hit by a speeding bus.  After watching a news report on the cause of explosion, Alex realizes that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the plane. He deduces that Ms. Lewton is next and rushes to her house to ensure her safety. Thinking Alex is up to no good, Ms. Lewton calls the FBI agents, who bring him in for questioning. Although Alex is unable to convince the agents of what is happening, they decide to let him go. Nonetheless, he is too late to save Ms. Lewton, whose house explodes after she is impaled by a falling kitchen knife.  The remaining survivors reunite and talk about what to do while driving through town. During the conversation, Carter learns he is next on Death's list. Frustrated over not having control over his life, Carter stops his car on railroad tracks, wanting to die on his own terms. He changes his mind at the last minute but can't get out when his seat-belt jams. Alex manages to save Carter just before the car is smashed by an oncoming train, and Billy is decapitated by flying [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]].  Alex deduces that, because he intervened, Death skipped Carter and moved onto Billy, and he realizes he is next on Death's list. Later, while hiding out in a fortified cabin, Alex recalls changing seats with two girls in his premonition, meaning Clear is actually next, and he rushes to save her while being chased by the agents. Meanwhile, Clear is stuck inside her car with a leaking gas tank, surrounded by loose electrical cables. Alex arrives at her house just in time and grabs the cable, allowing her to escape from the car just before it explodes.  Six months later, Alex, Clear, and Carter travel to Paris to celebrate their survival. While discussing their ordeal, Alex realizes that Death never skipped him. After seeing more omens, he leaves the table, and a bus almost hits him, but it swerves and crashes into a large neon sign that swings down towards Alex. Carter pushes Alex out of the way at the last second, and Alex says that Death has skipped him. When Carter asks who is next, the sign swings back down towards Carter, and the screen cuts to black followed by a loud smashing sound.

Fidelity (film)
 Talented Canadian photographer Clélia ([[Sophie Marceau]]) lands a lucrative job in Paris with a tabloid called ''La Verite'' run by scandal-mongerer Rupert MacRoi ([[Michel Subor]]). Clélia's mother once dated MacRoi years ago while working as a cabaret singer. Once she became pregnant with Clélia, she stopped seeing MacRoi and married Clélia's father. Accompanying her daughter to Paris, she tells Clélia that her strongest principle was honour, and encourages her to get married and settle down.  In Paris Clélia gives a television interview and talks about her two successful books of photography: a "study of absence" showing empty streets and deserted landscapes, and a study of fashion models without showing their faces. While walking the Paris streets taking photographs, Clélia meets Clève ([[Pascal Greggory]]), a bumbling middle-aged children's book publisher who is preparing to marry MacRoi's wealthy daughter to bolster his flagging publishing house. Clève is immediately attracted to Clélia and invites her back to his office where they make love. Afterwards, she meets Clève's brother Bernard, a Catholic bishop, and their father.  At the ''La Verite'' offices, Clélia finds most of her co-workers to be disillusioned and perverse—all knowing that they "earn their keep on dirt." At her first assignment covering a hockey team that MacRoi recently purchased, Clélia finds herself in the team's locker room surrounded by naked players celebrating their victory. MacRoi is there and after teasing her about her taking photos of the naked players asks if she'll join his family for a dinner party. Before she leaves, Clélia has sex with one of the players.  At MacRoi's dinner party, Clève loudly declares his love for Clélia before his entire family, including his fiance, Genièvre MacRoi, the sister of Rupert MacRoi. Genièvre responds by calling off their wedding and hitting him. Later that evening, following MacRoi's announcement of the purchase of Clève's publishing company, Clève's father collapses and dies while his son and Clélia look on. Clève asks Clélia never to leave him. At the funeral, Clève confides in Clélia his fears that MacRoi will not respect his family's publishing house now that he owns it, saying, "He massacres all that is upright and inneficient, delicate and noble." Soon after, Clélia and her mother move into Clève's house. He gives her his mother's engagement ring. In bed she reads lines from a W. H. Auden poem, "This like a dream keeps other time, and daytime is the loss of this, for time is inches and the heart's changes, where ghost has haunted lost and wanted. But this was never a ghost's endeavor, nor finished this, was ghost at ease, and till it pass love shall not near the sweetness here nor sorrow take his endless look."   Clélia's first portfolio of photos for ''La Verite'' creates a sensation and she is congratulated by her colleagues—all except Némo ([[Guillaume Canet]]), a sexy young photographer who promptly propositions her upon their first encounter. In spite of her sexual attraction to Némo, Clélia marries Clève in a ceremony marred somewhat by the presence of ''La Verite'' photographers and reporters, including Némo. After the wedding, Némo leaves his girlfriend, Ina (Edéa Darcque), a former African princess and Parisian prostitute whom he met investigating the illegal organ trade. He delivers his wedding photos to Clélia's home, handing them to her mother. Upset at the intrusion, and suspecting her daughter is having an affair, Clélia's mother collapses and soon dies.  Némo continues to follow Clélia, even taking photos of her in her house making love to her husband. Later she learns that Némo was given this assignment by MacRoi who is looking to find dirt on Clève. Although she continues to see Némo, Clélia resolutely keeps to her wedding vows in the face of her suitor's continued advances. She travels by train to Normandy to attend a motorcycle event in which Némo is a participant. During the race Némo crashes, and Clélia rushes to his side, revealing her feelings for him. At the celebration afterwards, Némo gets drunk and loud, talking about his investigation into the illegal organ trade and the shady International characters involved. Later that night he and Clélia take the train back to Paris together.   After Némo is attacked by a gang hired by the illegal organ traffickers, Clélia asks him to show her the world he is investigating—a dark world of brutal human fighting to the death. Throughout their time together, Némo continues his advances toward her, but Clélia resists. When she returns to her home, Clève is convinced she is having an affair, despite her promises that she's never lied to him and will never be unfaithful to him. After learning that his brother the bishop has run off with a married woman, Clève says he will join his brother in [[Plougastel-Daoulas]] in Brittany at The Happy Inn. After they make love Clève writes on the bathroom mirror, "Oh but what worm am I the victim of that you then unabashed did what I never wished confessed another love and I submissive, felt unwanted and went out?" After he leaves, Clélia calls the offices of ''La Verite'' to inform them of Bishop Bernard's "love-nest" in Brittany, and soon the scandal erupts in the news. Clélia watches the television coverage of his public humiliation. Clève does not return to his wife, and after sleeping with a transvestite prostitute, he calls ''La Verite'' asking that they track his wife who he believes is two-timing him.  Meanwhile, Clélia comes to Némo's house, where assassins hired by the organ traffickers blast the place with gunfire, but Némo and Clélia are able to defend themselves and escape. Soon after, Clélia attends a publicity session with MacRoi and a new partner. MacRoi presents Némo with a new expensive motorcycle for his work covering Clélia. During the session, assassins again attempt to kill Némo, and during the attack both Némo and Clève are injured. MacRoi is killed by a shard of glass in his eye. After the funeral, MacRoi's daughter reorganizes the company, intending to continue the scandal-mongering. She also fires Clélia, who later begs her husband to come back to her, but he will not reconsider. On their way out of the building he falls down a flight of steps and dies on the way to the hospital, with Clélia at his side. At the funeral she avoids Némo's advances and leaves Paris. Sometime later, Némo is interviewed on television and talks about his new portfolio dedicated to Clélia, who has disappeared.  A few years later, while taking photographs in a monastery, Clélia by chance sees the beginning of an English-language MacRoi Production film called ''The Princess of Cleve'' about her life, directed by Némo. She laughs as she discovers Némo's first name, Fernand, revealed in the opening credits. Before leaving the monastery, she places her wedding rings on a tree branch, while the ghost of her late husband looks on. Clélia can only say, "Forgive me." He smiles and retrieves the rings while she weeps.

Jamal takes a letter opener only to be surprised by Forrester and inadvertently leaves his backpack behind.  Forrester later drops Jamal's backpack onto the street. Jamal returns home to find that Forrester wrote notes in Jamal's journals. Jamal returns to Forrester's apartment and asks him to read more of his writing. Forrester tells him to begin with 5,000 words on why Jamal should "stay the fuck out of my home," which he completes and leaves on the doorstep the following day. Jamal returns the next day and is invited inside.  Forrester knows that a representative from Mailor-Callow, a prestigious private school, offered Jamal a full academic scholarship, partly for his skill on the basketball court and partly for his test scores. Jamal learns that Forrester is the author of a famous book, ''Avalon Landing'' and that he has never published another. Forrester agrees to help Jamal with his writing as long as Jamal does not ask about his personal life or tell others of his whereabouts.  Jamal's writing improves, which causes Robert Crawford, a professor at Mailor-Callow, to suspect plagiarism. Jamal convinces Forrester to attend a game at [[Madison Square Garden]] but Forrester cannot handle the crowds and has an anxiety attack.  Jamal takes him instead to see [[Yankee Stadium]] late at night after everyone has gone where Forrester tells Jamal details about his family, which explains the basis of his book, specifically his brother's post-war trauma, alcoholism and Forrester's indirect role in his death.

Meanwhile, there is a school writing contest coming up and Crawford forces Jamal to stay after school so he can watch him produce an essay. Jamal can not write under such conditions and running out of time, he submits one of Forrester's exercises to the contest.  Jamal is then called in by Crawford and the school board who reveal that Forrester indeed published the article that Jamal's essay is based on. Crawford finds the parallels between the two pieces and brings Jamal up on plagiarism charges. Jamal must either cite Forrester's work or prove he had Forrester's permission to use the material.  He refuses to do either to keep his promise to Forrester. Crawford demands that Jamal write an apology letter to his classmates and read it in front of the class which Jamal also refuses which may lead to his expulsion. Jamal tells Forrester what he has done and asks him to defend him but Forrester is angry at Jamal for breaking his promise about taking the paper.  Jamal accuses Forrester of being scared and selfish for not helping him. Jamal is told by the school that they will drop the plagiarism charges if he wins them the state championship. Jamal does well in the game but ambiguously misses two free throw shots at the end of the game, costing the team the championship. Jamal writes an essay to Forrester that discusses the gift of friendship.  Jamal's brother, Terrell, finds the essay sealed in an envelope and gives it to Forrester. Jamal attends the school contest. During the readings by other students, Forrester appears, announces himself and receives permission to read an essay that draws overwhelming applause from the students.  As Crawford is praising the work, Forrester acknowledges his friendship with Jamal and reveals that the essay he had just read was written by Jamal. He also explains that Jamal had written the contest essay using the published title and first paragraph with permission. Crawford adamantly states that this will not change any of the board's decisions. The board overrules him and drops the plagiarism charges, readmitting Jamal's entry to the competition.  After the competition, Forrester thanks Jamal for his friendship and tells him of his desire to visit his native land of Scotland. A year later, Forrester's attorney, Sanderson, meets with Jamal and tells him that Forrester died of cancer, with which he had been diagnosed before he met Jamal.

Chip congratulates Fred on attracting Wilma and apologizes for his humiliation of Fred's job. He invites the four to his [[Las Vegas|Rock Vegas]] resort as a peace offering. However, this is a plot by Chip to hope Fred gambles so Wilma dumps him, whereas Fred sees it as a chance to win big so he can impress Wilma with money like Chip's. Chip and his girlfriend Roxie are visited by two gangsters named Big Rocko and Little Rocko to collect a lot of money owed by Chip, who claims his upcoming marriage to Wilma will get him access to the Slaghoople fortune, and the gangsters consider that plan creditable, so they agree to suspend collections until after the wedding.

Angered that the two of them stole from her, Wilma goes back to Chip.  In prison, the men are visited by Gazoo, who earlier spied on Chip. Gazoo reveals that Chip is in severe debt to the mob, and hoped to solve both his problems by framing Fred for the robbery and plans to marry Wilma to get the Slaghooples' money.

For the Birds (film)
 A small blue bird lands on a telephone wire and makes itself comfortable, only to have a second small bird land next to it. The two birds quickly start to squabble as others land on the wire and join in. They are interrupted when a large, gangly, awkward looking bird sitting on top of the pole honks to them. Soon, the small birds start mocking the large one by puffing up their feathers to resemble its plumage and imitating its honk.   They then slide farther out along the wire and chatter suspiciously among themselves, ignoring the large bird's attempts to befriend them until it settles in the middle of all of them out on the wire. However, its weight causes the wire to sag almost to the ground and all the small birds slide down toward it.  As the large bird keeps trying to make friends, the small ones get annoyed and try to push it off the wire, only for it to lose its balance and flop over to hang upside down by its feet. The two nearest to the center start pecking at its toes, egged on by the rest of the crowd. One of the other birds suddenly panics, realizing how low the wire is and tries to stop the pecking.   The others understand and stop too late; when the large bird's last toe slides off, the wire snaps upward and flings all the small birds out of sight like a slingshot. The large bird is so close to the ground that it settles down easily, accompanied by a shower of feathers from the small birds.  One of them falls to the ground, having lost all its feathers and the large bird laughs and offers it a leaf to cover itself. The others soon tumble down as well and hide behind the large bird as it laughs even harder. A white splatter with the words, "the end" on it against a black screen, similar to the mess caused by bird droppings, marks the end of the film.

Brennick tries to escape in a water-delivery shuttle but is caught and sent to "The Hole" - an exposed area of the ship where John is bombarded with solar radiation while the station faces the sun and extreme cold when its orbit takes it behind the Earth. When Men-Tel's president arrives he tries to kill John by jettisoning him without a spacesuit. John manages to hold his breath and propel himself towards another airlock and back into the prison. Due to the sudden decompression, the computerized warden, Zed, begins to malfunction and cannot perform its duties. John uses a prison gun to destroy the computer and Teller is subsequently electrocuted. John and all his friends board the Shuttle and head back to Earth, where John reunites with his family.

G-Saviour
 The year is Universal Century 0223. The Earth Federation has collapsed, and autonomy has been restored to the various territories under the Earth Federation's control. The Space Colonies have shaken off their colonial past and now consider themselves independent "Settlements". In this new power scheme two sides have emerged: the Congress of Settlement Nations (CONSENT), which is largely made up of former Earth Federation members and encompasses Sides 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and their Earth-bound parent nations, and the Settlement Freedom League, composed of Sides 1, 4, and the Lunar Cities.  Mark Curran is an ex-CONSENT pilot who now works for the underwater harvesting corporation Hydro-Gen, stationed at the [[Atlantic Ocean|Deep Face Trench]] sea lab. While out on a harvesting run, Mark saves CONSENT lieutenant Tim Holloway. Shortly after the lieutenant is saved, the lab is commandeered by a Congressional task force, led by Mark's former superior, Jack Halle. As the lab's security system is triggered, Mark goes off to investigate. Mark saves one of the intruders, Cynthia Graves, from Jack's firing squad after she surrenders, while another is killed.  CONSENT is in the midst of food shortage, with its leaders threatening military force to take over the neutral Side 8 colony of Gaea. General Garneuax asks Mark to interrogate Cynthia, who is revealed to be a Gaean rebel. Mark helps Cynthia escape, who shows him an enzyme that will solve the food crisis. The two meet up with Cynthia's interns, Dieter and Kobi, and the four escape into space along with Mark's fiancée Mimi. The group arrives at the Side 4 settlement of New Manhattan, meeting with Philippe San Simeone, an old acquaintance of Mark. Philippe entrusts Mark with a new prototype mobile weapon, the Gundam G-SAVIOUR, but he refuses at first; Mark comes around to piloting the suit to help clear a debris field on the way to Gaea.  Arriving at Gaea, Mark and Cynthia meet Chief Councilor Graves, Cynthia's father. Graves tell them that a Congressional space fleet is on its way to Gaea, looking to apprehend the two. After seeing Mark and Cynthia share a kiss, Mimi hacks into Gaea's defense system, causing multiple destroyer missiles to fire at a CONSENT ship. After Mark concludes that a mobile suit carrier is on its way to attack the colony, Cynthia asks Mark to lead Gaea's mobile suit force against the attack. Both sides launch their mobile suit forces, with CONSENT greatly outmatching Gaea's forces. Jack sorties out in his CAMS-13 MS-Rai, with Mark engaging him in battle with the G-SAVIOUR. Congressional forces enter the colony, with Kobi being critically wounded while trying to protect the enzyme sample. After retrieving the sample, Garneuax reveals his true intentions to destroy the sample and implement a policy of selective starvation. With Gaea's forces dwindling, Philippe and the Illuminati's forces arrive and push back the Congressional attack.  As Mark and the G-SAVIOUR enter Gaea, Garneuax and Mimi escape from the settlement in a Gaean space shuttle. Mimi reveals that she switched out the enzyme and that is back in the possession of Cynthia, as the shuttle is shot down by CONSENT forces. With Garneuax dead and Jack incapacitated, the Congressional forces withdraw from Gaea. Councilor Graves gives a speech stating that Side 8 will stay independent, while Mark returns to Earth with Cynthia.  
Frequency (film)
 In October 1969, firefighter Frank Sullivan ([[Dennis Quaid|Quaid]]) dies in a warehouse fire, leaving behind his wife Julia ([[Elizabeth Mitchell]]) and six-year-old son John. Thirty years later, in 1999, John ([[Jim Caviezel|Caviezel]]), now an [[NYPD]] detective, is dumped by his girlfriend Samantha for being emotionally shut off. John's childhood friend Gordo ([[Noah Emmerich]]) finds a [[Heathkit#The SB-series and HW-series|Heathkit]] [[Single-sideband modulation|single-sideband]] [[ham radio]] that once belonged to Frank, but fails to get it working. The night before the anniversary of his father's death, John is surprised to find the radio broadcasting during an occurrence of the [[aurora borealis]], and has a brief conversation with another man concerning the [[1969 World Series]], which John is able to recount in specific detail. Eventually, he realizes that the other man is Frank and tries to warn him of his impending death. The next day, while attempting to rescue a young girl, Frank heeds his son's warning and manages to escape the warehouse. That evening, the two reconnect and learn a great deal about each other's lives.  Subsequently, John begins to notice major changes in the present: His mother Julia no longer lives at her current address, Samantha doesn't recognize him, and he learns that Frank died in 1989 from lung cancer. His boss, Sgt. Satch DeLeon ([[Andre Braugher]]), an old friend of Frank's, assigns him to investigate the "Nightingale", a serial killer who murdered three nurses in the 1960s and was never caught. However, John discovers that the Nightingale is now connected to ten murders, including that of his mother two weeks after Frank's now-avoided death. Feeling guilty that their actions somehow led to the Nightingale committing more murders, John persuades his father to help him prevent these crimes from occurring. Frank manages to save the first victim.  But when he tries to rescue the second, the Nightingale subdues him, steals his driver's license, and plants it on the victim to frame Frank for the murder.  When Frank shares his experience with his son, John realizes Frank's wallet has the Nightingale's fingerprints.  John instructs his father to wrap his wallet in plastic and hide it somewhere in the house where John can find it 30 years later.  Using the preserved fingerprints from the wallet, John identifies the Nightingale as Jack Shepard ([[Shawn Doyle]]), a former detective.  In the original timeline, Shepard died from a medical error the same night Frank died.  But since, in the new timeline, Julia didn't leave the hospital early after learning of Frank's death, she was at the hospital and prevented the error that would have killed Shepard.  Meanwhile, Frank is approached by then-Detective Satch DeLeon who tries to arrest him on suspicion of murder.  (Later, in an attempt to prove his innocence, Frank is able to predict various aspects of the [[1969 World Series]] to Satch, including the infamous Game 5 "shoe polish incident".)  In the resulting struggle, the radio is knocked over and sustains damage, shutting it off.  While awaiting questioning, Frank activates the precinct's [[fire sprinkler system]], escapes, and breaks into Shepard's apartment, where he finds jewelry taken from the victims.  Shepard catches Frank in the act and pursues him, ending with a fight underwater where Frank appears to have killed Shepard. Satch, having arrived in time to witness the struggle, finds the jewelry from the victims and Frank is exonerated.  Frank fixes the radio, but while talking both he and John are attacked by the 1969 and 1999 versions of Shepard. Using a [[shotgun]], Frank manages to blow off Shepard's right hand in 1969, causing Shepherd's hand to disappear in 1999 just as he's about to kill John as the changes in the past affect the present. The timeline rapidly fixes itself in 1999 and an elderly Frank, having quit smoking to avoid his death in 1989, kills Shepard with the same shotgun, and embraces his son.  The film concludes with a baseball game including John, Samantha (now his wife), John's young son, Frank, Julia, Satch and Gordo, who's now wealthy on account of having invested in [[Yahoo!]] on John's advice through the radio.  
Gaja Gamini
 The central figure of the film is represented by a mysterious figure called "Gaja Gamini" ([[Madhuri Dixit]]), who inspires, arouses, and confuses the common man. "Gaja Gamini" is the inspiration behind Leonardo da Vinci's ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]) 'Mona Lisa', Kalidas' poem "Shakuntala", and a photojournalist named Shahrukh's ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) photographs. The mysterious "Gaja Gamini" appears as four characters, one of them being Sangeeta, a blind girl from Banaras at the beginning of time, who inspires village women (Farida Jalal, Shilpa Shirodkar, and Shabana Aazmi) to revolt against a male-dominated system and carve a niche for women forever. Another character is Shakuntala, who is the subject of Kalidas' poem of the same name. Shakuntala incites jealousy in the women and love in the men around her, charming humans and animals alike in the forests of Kerala. "Gaja Gamini" is also Mona Lisa during the Renaissance, the object of painter Leonardo da Vinci's obsession. Finally, Monika, the most confusing sector of the film, is supposed to represent the woman of the New Millennium. Kamdev, the God of Love ([[Inder Kumar]]), walks the earth throughout history, attempting to win the love of "Gaja Gamini".  Thrown into this mix is a large black wall, separating two different periods, and confrontations between Science ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]) and Art ([[Mohan Agashe]]) at different points in history, showing that the world itself can change, but its original ideas will always be the same. For example, a play by Shakespeare written and performed by actors in the 15th century will still be performed in the 21st century, but with different actors. The confrontations between art and science also bring about the idea that while science is firmly set on believing that which can only be proved, the basis for art is that which can be proved, and an intuitive sense that can be felt. Science uses the brain, while Art uses the brain and the heart. Another facet of the film is a "gathri", a small bundle which a woman carries upon her head, like a burden, with which she must walk forever.<ref></ref><ref>[http://in.movies.yahoo.com/movies/Gaja-Gamini/details-9090.html Gaja Gamini]  [[Yahoo!

Fuckland
 The film takes place decades after the [[Falklands War]] between Argentina and the [[United Kingdom]] for the control of the [[Falkland Islands]] in the South [[Atlantic Ocean]].  The film tells of Fabián Stratas, a [[magician (illusion)|magician]] and [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] from [[Buenos Aires]], who saves his money from weddings, birthdays, and bar mitzvahs, and uses a hidden camera to document a week-long trip to the Falkland Islands, (or "Fuckland", as he calls them), where he has an ingenious Argentine patriotic plan: to impregnate a Falklander woman.  Stratas has a theory: if only 500 Argentines did the same each year, the islands would soon be overrun with half-Argentines, and he would be the head of a "sexual invasion."  He spends his first couple of days on the island doing reconnaissance, and soon sets his eyes on Camilla Heaney, whom he first saw in church.  He chats her up at an Internet café and then they go out for drinks, which is followed by dinner. They also take a field trip to see the King penguins and the 1982 battlefield.  Fabian has initial success, getting to have sex with Camilla twice, first in his hotel room and then on the beach. He succeeds and manages to impregnate her before leaving for Buenos Aires, cocky and happy for having achieved his goal and duped his lover. However, Heaney gets the last word, making a videotape on Fabian's camera where she denounces him as the shallow, condescending and self-centered Argentine he is. After this, the camera shows Stratas, unfazed by Camilla's anger, taking a shower while singing the [[Charly García]] cover of the [[Argentine National Anthem]].

Gangster No. 1
 The film opens with an unnamed British veteran gangster (McDowell) attending a boxing match with friends. Hearing in conversation that a gangster by the name of Freddie Mays is to be released from prison after 30-years, he becomes upset and leaves without a word.  The narrative flashes back to the 1960s, showing a younger Gangster (Bettany). He comes to the attention of an influential London gangster, Freddie Mays (Thewlis) who recruits him as an enforcer. The Gangster is eager to please; his violence at first impresses Mays, and he soon proves his loyalty with creative methods of murder. The Gangster quickly becomes obsessed with and deeply jealous of Mays' glamorous lifestyle and success.  The Gangster discovers that Mays' rival, Lennie Taylor ([[Jamie Foreman]]), is planning to kill Mays. Instead of warning his boss, the Gangster decides to let the attack take place, killing the only other member of his own gang who knew of the impending attack. It goes as planned and the Gangster sits in a car nearby to watch as Lennie and his gang shoot and stab Mays and slit the throat of his fiancée, Karen ([[Saffron Burrows]]). Later that night, the Gangster goes to Lennie's flat, shoots him in the leg and then tortures him to death.  The Gangster discovers next day that Mays did not die but was hospitalised. Mays is unjustly convicted of Taylor's murder and sent to prison for 30 years. With Mays out of his way, the Gangster becomes leader of the gang and consolidates his power over the city's underworld. In a sequence spanning the years between 1968 and 1999, he organizes a bank heist, opens a casino, fixes horse races and builds his gang to over 300 men. The narrative returns to the aged Gangster at the boxing event.  The Gangster discovers that Karen also survived and is due to marry Mays, who has left prison a changed man. The men meet in May's old flat. The Gangster angrily denounces Mays, who seemingly has no fight left in him, wanting only to marry Karen and retire in peace. The Gangster threatens Mays with a gun, then gives Mays the gun and begs him to kill him; Mays leaves.  The film closes with the Gangster, having apparently lost his mind, committing suicide by stepping off the top of a building, with his last words being "I'm number one".

 [[Las Vegas]] mob enforcer Jack Carter returns home to [[Seattle]] after hearing that his brother, Ritchie, was killed in a drunk-driving accident. His partner, Con McCarty, covers for him with the mob boss, Fletcher -whose girlfriend Audrey is having an affair with Jack.  At his brother's funeral, Jack meets his niece, Doreen, and Eddie, a friend and coworker of Ritchie. Both tell Jack that Ritchie rarely drank and would never have driven while intoxicated; Eddie also said Ritchie was most certainly not involved in illicit activities. He also talks to a woman, Geraldine, but she is evasive and cryptic about her relationship to Ritchie. At the wake, Jack continues questioning mourners and well-wishers about what happened to his brother, drawing the ire of Ritchie's widow.  He confronts the owner of the club Ritchie managed, loan shark Cliff Brumby. Brumby doesn’t believe Ritchie was murdered, but does tell Jack that Ritchie was having an affair with Geraldine, an associate of local boss Cyrus Paice.  Jack questions Paice but doesn’t get any useful information. He follows Paice and is lead to Jeremy Kinnear, a wealthy computer mogul who hired Paice to discreetly procure beautiful women for him at parties so he can present a "professional" and squeaky-clean image. However, Paice is now blackmailing Kinnear into running Paice's pornographic websites. Unable to get any straight answers, Jack carefully examines surveillance tapes from Brumby's club.  He discovers that Paice produces [[Amateur pornography|amateur porn movies]] using young girls drugged and raped by Eddie and Geraldine; one video shows Doreen as one of the victims.

Audrey breaks up with Jack, who tells Fletcher that he is done with Vegas; McCarty and another gangster are sent to confront Jack. Jack talks with Doreen about what happened in the video, comforting her and telling her she is a good person.  Jack sets out on a path of vengeance.

Eddie tells Jack that Paice is at Kinnear's; Jack throws him off the balcony to his death. McCarty tracks Jack to Eddie's apartment, beginning a car chase; McCarty is forced off the road, crashing violently and presumably killing the mobsters. At Kinnear's house, Jack confronts Paice, who claims Kinnear is the man behind Ritchie's murder. Jack attempts to hit Paice from behind, but Paice sees him in a reflection and ducks. Paice then pummels him to the ground while commenting that Ritchie put up more of a fight than he did, thereby admitting that he was involved in his brother's death. Paice walks away and joins some women on the busy dance floor.  Bloodied, Jack gets up and follows Paice to the dance foor, telling him he should finish what he starts. Paice agrees; he tries to sucker punch Jack, but Jack floors him with one punch before brutally beating Paice. Jack pulls his pistol and points it directly at Paice's face, but changes his mind and leaves him on the floor, bloody and unconscious.  Jack confronts Kinnear, who says that he only told Paice to get the disc back from Ritchie, not kill him, and that Paice and Brumby committed the murder; Jack lets Kinnear live.  Jack finds Brumby attempting to steal the disk from Jack’s car. Brumby admits involvement in the murder, warning Jack that killing him will force him to run for the rest of his life. As Brumby walks away, Jack calls out to him. Brumby won't turn around and Jack shoots him in the back.  Having settled the score for his brother, Carter meets Doreen one last time at Ritchie's grave and explains that he has to go away for a while.

At first, Geppetto is thrilled to have his wish come true, but runs into a string of problems, such as Pinocchio asking unnecessary questions when trying to get to sleep, getting into mischief and wandering off when introducing him to everyone in town, and showing no interest in being a toymaker. The next day, Geppetto sends Pinocchio off to school, telling him to just act like all the other children and he'll do fine. However, Pinocchio gets into a fight at school, in which he was imitating all the other children. A disappointed Geppetto takes him home where an unsuccessful puppeteer named [[Mangiafuoco|Stromboli]] ([[Brent Spiner]]) becomes interested, thinking he would make him a fortune as the main attraction in his puppet show. Geppetto, still furious at Pinocchio's misbehavior, tries to reason with the Blue Fairy, but she doesn't believe him. He returns home to apologize to Pinocchio, only to find out he ran away to live with Stromboli. Geppetto decides to say goodbye to Pinocchio by watching him perform in Stromboli's puppet show. Stromboli is pleased with Pinocchio as his star puppet which has made him lots of money. But when Pinocchio asks to let him go, Stromboli refuses, stating it would violate a contract he was supposed to sign. When Geppetto arrives, hoping to say goodbye, Stromboli explains that Pinocchio left after the show, claiming that he wanted to see the world. After he leaves, Stromboli is outraged when he notices that Pinocchio ran away from the show and spots him boarding a stagecoach to [[Pleasure Island (Pinocchio)|Pleasure Island]]. He decides to recapture him while Geppetto goes out to rescue him as well, with the Blue Fairy following him, attempting to assist him in his quest. Along the way, he meets an inept [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]] named Lezarno ([[Wayne Brady]]) and Professor Buonragazzo ([[René Auberjonois]]) who lives in the town of Idyllia, where he and his son make perfect and ideal children who always obey their parents. He then arrives at Pleasure Island where he finds out it harnesses a terrible curse in which all the boys turn into donkeys after riding a rollercoaster. He arrives just in time to take Pinocchio home, but Pinocchio refuses, saying he didn't want him because of what a big disappointment he was to him and immediately turns into a donkey once he gets on the rollercoaster and is shipped off to sea by boat.  Geppetto, trying to keep up with the boat, accidentally gets swallowed by [[The Terrible Dogfish|a monstrous whale]]. Pinocchio jumps off the boat and into the water where he gets swallowed by the whale as well and the donkey curse washes away. Geppetto apologizes for the way he acted and noticing that they are inside the whale, they attempt to get out by having Pinocchio tell a lot of lies, causing his nose to grow and tickle the whale's uvula to throw them up. Afterwards, they return to the toy shop where Stromboli arrives to take Pinocchio back, still keeping him under the contract he signed. Geppetto offers him his whole toy shop in exchange for Pinocchio. As Stromboli captures him, Geppetto begs and pleads to the Blue Fairy, who can no longer help, to grant him one last wish. The Fairy then turns Pinocchio into a real boy with her magic and shoos Stromboli away with her magic. Pinocchio and Geppetto live happily ever after and the words on the sign of Geppetto's shop now read, "Geppetto & Son."<ref name="lat" />

The next day at headquarters, the trio of cops join others in seeing Dr. Tang demonstrating the recovered Hong Kong robot but things don't go as planned. On the day of the convention, the FBI arrives and Edison looks at Jane, who looks back only to get distracted. It is soon apparent that the Hong Kong Police and the FBI are not going to be able to get along. When Jane attempts to show a demonstration of the security system, the system does not work. Ian gets miffed and when Hong Kong lieutenant Chung asks if they can get the FBI anything, all the agents request coffee. Match is not happy, but Alien happily takes the task as he intends to put his dandruff in all of the coffee for the FBI agents. When Match tries out a cup, Alien looks at him with a surprising look. Edison receives a call from an old friend and meets the friend that night at Jumbo Restaurant.  The old friend is Kurt, who is still somewhat shocked that Edison is a cop. When Edison tells Kurt he will help him, the two hug it out only for Kurt to drug Edison with a hypnosis drug. Under the hypnosis, Edison breaks into headquarters and steals the robot. Kurt once again hacks into RS-1 and has the robot kill Doctor Cameron. Edison breaks out of the spell and is surprised to learn that he had killed Quincy, who was actually trying to kill him admitting Kurt's treachery beforehand. When Ian sees the dead Quincy, he fights Edison but Edison escapes and resorts to taking Jane as a hostage. After a standoff involving Match and Alien as well as the FBI, the two end up in Kurt's van where Edison finally learns what had happened. He and Jane make their escape, destroying the friendship between Edison and Kurt. Match and Alien soon become the scapegoats for Edison when they learn that if Edison and the robot cannot be recovered, they will have to take the fall.  The next day, Edison remembers a man in a lobster suit during his hypnosis. He and Jane, who is starting to believe that Edison may be innocent after all, find the lobster man. However, they were both tracked by Match and Alien as well as the FBI. Jane returns with the FBI while Edison, Match, and Alien are being shot at by the FBI. Edison finds an unexpected ally in the lobster man, who helps him escape. As for Match and Alien, the two end up in the hospital along with the injured FBI agents. A confrontation between Match and Ian almost gets physical until Ross and Chung arrive to break it up. Ian assures Match and Alien that they will take the fall if Edison and the robot are not found. Jane attempts to convince Ian that Edison may have been drugged and may be innocent, but Ian won't hear of it. Ross tells everyone to cool off and they leave the hospital.  Edison finds Kurt in an abandoned warehouse, where the two start to fight. Match and Alien have been tracking Edison and find the robot. They soon find themselves in the mix when they face Kurt's men. Kurt, however, escapes again but Match and Alien trap Edison and tell him they have to take them in to save themselves. When Match and Alien bring Edison back to headquarters, they are hailed as heroes for the arrest of Edison.  However, they soon become convinced that Edison may be innocent as well. With help from Oli, Match's techie girlfriend, and Peggy, a techie who has a serious crush on Alien, they are able to tap into Edison's memory and have learned where the robot may be found. When they decide to find RS-1, Jane confronts them only to agree to help them out. They learn Kurt plans to sell RS-1 to an Arab terrorist but as they bust the dealers and Kurt, Ross arrives. When Jane asks Ross where backup is, Ross is revealed to be involved in the entire scheme with the dead agent Quincy. When the deal is finalized, Ian arrives in time and had learned of Ross betraying everyone only to put a tracking device himself on Ross. This leads to a confrontation while Kurt escapes with the robot. The terrorist is killed and a fight ensues between Ross and Ian. As Ross begins to get the upper hand, Match comes to the rescue and he and Ian team up to fight Ross. When Ross gets Ian to the edge of a shipping container, he points his gun towards Ian. Match comes up from behind and drop kicks Ross off the container to his death. Ross and Ian realize they have to get the robot.  Kurt has unleashed the robot all over the city, destroying anything in its path. Edison and Alien catch up to Kurt and RS-1 at the convention center. An attempt from the robot from Mainland China results in that robot being destroyed. However, Dr. Tang installs a virus to be transferred from his robot to RS-1. When the virus is uploaded, RS-1 destroys Tang's robot. Kurt is convinced that RS-1 is the ultimate robot and when he stands in victory, the now virus-filled RS-1 guns down Kurt to his death. An attempt to take out RS-1 by Match, Alien, and Edison fails. However, with the virus came a self-destruct button, and with the clock ticking, Ian arrives by car and the trio of Hong Kong police wrap a chain around RS-1. The four cops drive to the harbor and send RS-1 into the water, where it explodes.  Match, Alien, and Edison are in the back of an ambulance when they see Ian, who tells them they have to settle one more thing. The trio are at first angry until they learn the thing that has to be settled is to find the best bar in Hong Kong to celebrate solving the case. As Ian tells them to hurry, Edison, Match, and Alien head off to meet with Jane and Ian.

Ginger Snaps (film)
 In Bailey Downs, a rash of dog killings has been occurring. Brigitte and Ginger Fitzgerald are teenage sisters who harbour a fascination with death and, as children, formed a pact to die together. One night, while on the way to kidnap a dog owned by school bully Trina Sinclair, Ginger begins her first period, which results in the girls being attacked by the creature responsible for the maulings. The creature wounds and bites Ginger, but Brigitte rescues her. As the girls flee, the creature is run over by a van belonging to Sam Miller, a local drug dealer. Ginger decides not to go the hospital as her wounds heal quickly.  Following the attack, Ginger undergoes physical and mental transformations that concern Brigitte. Ginger starts to behave aggressively and grow hair from her wounds, sprouts a tail, and heavily menstruates. Ignoring Brigitte's warnings, Ginger has unprotected sex with a classmate named Jason and kills a neighbour's dog. Brigitte and Sam agree that Ginger was attacked by a werewolf and is in the process of turning into one. On Sam's advice, Brigitte persuades Ginger to have her navel pierced using a silver ring in the hopes of curing her but it proves ineffective. Sam then suggests a [[monkshood]] solution, which is not possible as the plant is only found in the spring.  Later, Trina shows up at the Fitzgerald house to accuse Ginger of kidnapping her dog. As she fights with Ginger, Trina is accidentally killed when she slips and hits her head on the kitchen counter. The sisters narrowly avoid their parents as they put the body in a freezer, explaining the blood as part of another school photo project. Brigitte accidentally breaks off two of Trina's fingers while trying to get the corpse from the freezer. They lose the fingers when they bury Trina's body in the tool shed. Brigitte tells Ginger she can't go out anymore, but Ginger remains defiant.  On [[Halloween]], Brigitte takes monkshood purchased by her mother for a craft project and asks Sam to make the cure. While trying to track down Ginger, Brigitte is attacked by Jason (who was infected by Ginger due to unprotected sex) and she defends herself by using the monkshood on him. She witnesses his immediate change in behaviour, which proves it is a cure. At school, Brigitte finds that Ginger has murdered the guidance counselor and witnesses her kill the school janitor.  The girls' mother finds the fingers and Trina's corpse, and goes looking for her daughters. While she is looking for them, she sees Brigitte running and picks her up. As she drives Brigitte to the Greenhouse Bash, she tells her that she will protect them and the three of them will run away together; she will burn the house down by letting it fill up with gas, then lighting a match to erase evidence of Trina's death. Brigitte arrives to find Sam rejecting Ginger's advances. As he approaches Ginger, she breaks his arm. In despair, Brigitte infects herself as Sam pleads with her not to. As the sisters leave, Sam knocks Ginger out with a shovel. Brigitte and Sam then take her back to the Fitzgerald house in his van, and prepare more of the cure for Ginger.  Ginger fully transforms into a werewolf on the way home and escapes the van. Aware that she has transformed, Sam and Brigitte hide in the pantry as he makes the cure. When he goes to find Ginger, Ginger attacks Sam. Brigitte picks up the dropped syringe and follows the blood trail downstairs. After finding an injured and bloody Sam she tries to save him by drinking his blood in an attempt to calm Ginger, but can't go through with it. Ginger sees Brigitte's revulsion and kills Sam in front of her by biting him in the jugular.  As Ginger stalks Brigitte through the basement, Brigitte returns to the room where they grew up. Finding the knife that Ginger had been using to try to remove her tail, Brigitte holds the syringe with the cure in one hand and the knife in the other. Ginger lunges at her, and into the knife. Brigitte lays her head upon her dying sister's chest and sobs.

Buddy sets his father on fire, and it is revealed that Buddy's father sexually abused him as a child. Buddy is eventually taken to a mental hospital.  Later, Annie receives another vision divulging that Donnie is innocent. She asks prosecutor David Duncan to reopen the case. After Duncan declines, Annie counters that if he does not do so she will reveal David and Jessica's sexual activity which she witnessed. Duncan attempts to bribe Annie in exchange for her silence, but Annie refuses, only wanting justice for Barksdale.  Annie tells Wayne that Donnie is not responsible for Jessica's death, and that Duncan will not reopen the investigation. At Wayne's suggestion, he and Annie drive out to the pond that night, where Annie learns from a vision that Wayne is actually the murderer. Wayne confesses to Annie that he was angry after he discovered that she was cheating on him. Wayne attempts to kill Annie by striking her in the head with a flashlight, but Buddy appears and knocks him out. Annie and Buddy lock the unconscious Wayne in the trunk of Annie's car.  To stop her head wound from bleeding, Buddy uses a handkerchief that Annie had lent him earlier. The two drive to the police station. Annie tells Buddy that he will have to return to the mental hospital and he waits in the car while she enters the station. When she returns to the car with the police, Buddy has disappeared.

God's Army (film)
 ''God's Army'' is about [[Mormon]] [[Mormon missionary|missionaries]] as they struggle with their work and, almost inevitably, their [[faith]].  The movie focuses on a pair of missionaries, Elder Allen (Brown) and Elder Dalton (Dutcher) serving as missionaries in [[Los Angeles, California]] ("[[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|Elder]]" is an office in the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood]] and a title male LDS missionaries use while serving missions).  Dalton is a seasoned missionary and Allen is a new recruit paired with Dalton to be trained.  Allen questions his reason for being on a mission.  He is a somewhat faithful member of the church, but his father was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] from the church and his mother doesn't attend anymore.  Dalton proves to be a demanding taskmaster and he demands much of Allen&mdash;almost too much in Allen's eyes.  Allen teeters on the brink of leaving his two-year mission almost as soon as it begins.  Allen witnesses another missionary lose his faith and abandon his own mission.  Allen changes his mind as he finds the sacrifices others have made to be on a mission, such as ostricization from family.

After a trial of his faith and some earnest soul searching, Allen finds untapped courage and embraces his work as a messenger of [[God]].  
Godzilla vs. Megaguirus
 The prologue of the film acknowledges the events of the [[Godzilla (1954 film)|first ''Godzilla'' film]] (using the present Godzilla monster rather than the 1954 monster), while inventing its own timeline, explaining that the capital of Japan was moved from Tokyo to [[Osaka]]. The film takes place in an alternate universe with advanced technology, explaining that in 1966, [[Godzilla]] attacks the first Japanese nuclear plant in [[Tokai, Ibaraki|Tokai]], [[Ibaraki Prefecture]]. After this, the G-Graspers, a section of [[Japanese Self Defence Force]], was dedicated to fight Godzilla. In 1996, clean plasma energy replaced nuclear energy, but this did not deter Godzilla from attacking. Plasma energy is also banned, due to the fact that Godzilla attacked the original plasma energy [[Fusion power|reactor]].  In 2001, an experimental [[satellite]]-based weapon that fires miniature [[black hole]]s, called the Dimension Tide, opens a [[wormhole]] through which a [[Meganula|prehistoric dragonfly]] enters the present and deposits a single egg before exiting through the wormhole. A boy finds the egg and takes it with him when he moves to Tokyo. The egg starts oozing a strange liquid, so the boy throws the egg in the [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]. The egg, actually a mass of hundreds of eggs, splits up and starts growing when exposed to water, hatching into large dragonfly [[larvae]] called [[Meganulon]] that come out of the sewer to feed. They flood a portion of the city and [[molt]] on the sides of buildings, becoming adult Meganula.  Meanwhile, Godzilla appears in search of a source of nuclear energy, despite the edict shutting down all such attractants after its three previous appearances. While Godzilla is fighting the G-Graspers, who are assisted by rebellious scientist Hajime Kudo, the swarm of Meganula are attracted in turn to Godzilla's energy, and attack it. During the course of the battle, the Dimension Tide is launched, but Godzilla survives the attack. Most of the Meganula are killed by both Godzilla and the Dimension Tide, but a few manage to drain off some of Godzilla's energy and return to the sewer. With the last of their strength, the Meganula inject Godzilla's energy into a huge, sleeping larva that is in a giant, pulsating [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]]. It molts and appears from the water as Megaguirus, the queen of the Meganula.  After destroying part of Tokyo with shock waves generated by her beating wings, Megaguirus heads to the waterfront and faces Godzilla. Being territorial, Megaguirus considers the city to be her hunting ground. As they engage in a lengthy battle, she uses her speed to avoid Godzilla's attacks, but Godzilla eventually uses his speed against her. As she flies toward Godzilla, it lunges forward with its dorsal fins in her path. She flies into the fins, and one of her arms is severed. Megaguirus, having been mutated by Godzilla's energy, generates a blast similar to Godzilla's atomic breath and knocks Godzilla down. Megaguirus speeds forward with the stinger on her long tail lowered, trying to stab Godzilla between the eyes. In a climactic moment, Godzilla catches the stinger in its mouth and crushes it in its jaws. Godzilla finally blasts Megaguirus with atomic breath, causing her to burst into flames and die.  It is revealed that Godzilla was attracted to a secret plasma energy project housed at the Science Institute, in violation of the ban. The G-Graspers continue their mission to destroy Godzilla, but with the Dimension Tide falling out of [[orbit]] they are unable to get a lock on it. The vengeful Major Kiriko Tsujimori pilots a ship towards Godzilla, ejecting only at the last second. The Dimension Tide is able to lock on to the craft and fires just before burning up on reentry; Godzilla blasts at the approaching black hole with its atomic heat ray, but vanishes. In a postlude, however, Tsujimori again enlists Kudo to investigate suspicious seismic activity; then in an after-credits scene, Godzilla's roar is heard again. An aftereffect of the Dimension Tide machine is temporary wormholes. As Megaguirus came to Earth through one, did Godzilla return to Earth through a wormhole caused by it being sent into the black hole?  
The Goddess of 1967
 The storyline opens in Tokyo where JM (Rikiya Kurokawa), a rich young IT worker and sometime computer hacker, is attempting to purchase a 1967 model Citroën DS, or Goddess, as it is known to French car aficionados. JM lives in a pristine but unfriendly hi-tech apartment. The smog filled city is blue-grey and bleak. He rarely speaks to his live-in girlfriend and is preoccupied with other possessions—his latest snorkeling gear as well as the pet snakes and other exotic reptiles he keeps in the flat. After tracing, on the Internet, a perfectly restored Citroën owned by a couple in Australia, JM abandons his job and flies out to purchase the rare car, which he thinks can fill the emptiness in his life.  No one meets JM at the airport but he eventually finds the home where the car is located and meets BG ([[Rose Byrne]]), a blind and emotionally unstable young woman. BG, who is minding a young child, explains that the couple did not actually own the Citroën and that the husband shot his wife and then killed himself after a violent argument over money. She shows him the car and tells him, after he has test driven it, that she can take him to its real owner, who is somewhere in the [[Outback]], a five-day drive away. Intoxicated by the vehicle, JM agrees. BG abandons the young child at a service station, after calling the police, instructing her not to trust anyone.  As BG and JM journey into the spectacular but harsh landscape, the viewer is taken on a series of complex and often confusing flashbacks which attempt to illustrate the dark tragedies that have shaped their respective lives. JM, we learn, became fabulously wealthy after a friend gave him the computer password to a major bank. The friend, who claims the reason he is not using the password himself is that he is getting married, is run over and killed by a passing truck. JM's infatuation with the car is apparently an attempt to fill the emotional gap created by his friend's death and the barren life he leads in Tokyo, which, he tells BG, is alien and "just like Mars".  Most of the flashbacks, however, concern BG. She was sexually attacked three years earlier by a young boxer from a travelling circus who is frustrated in his attempts by a [[Chastity belt]]. BG then escaped into the bush where she was protected by wild dingoes. As a young child, she was also sexually abused by her grandfather (who is her blood father) and traumatised by Marie (Elise McCredie), her disoriented and deeply religious mother. Grandpa ([[Nicholas Hope]]), who was a hippie, a wine maker and then an opal miner, believes his outback existence frees him from all moral constraints.  BG's favourite radio show is the obituary notices program and she is infatuated by the sound of insects splattering on the Citroën's windscreen, which, she explains to JM, is the "sound of death". Although blind, BG carries a pistol which she fires occasionally: the first time at two sinister men who pull alongside the car during JM's test drive and later, in the outback, to destroy the radio she uses to listen to the obituary notices. Unbeknownst to JM, BG's grandfather owns the car and she is leading JM to him not to consummate the car's sale but in order to kill the old man.  In the course of their journey through an unremittingly hostile world inhabited by cruel outback men and women, the couple become friends and, after JM teaches BG how to dance, tentative lovers. BG eventually finds her grandfather and confronts him in his rundown opal mine. She had planned to shoot him but, having reconciled her past in the course of the trip and found someone who genuinely cares for her, decides not to go ahead with it. The film ends with BG and JM travelling off together in the Citroën, the message being that humane relationships are only possible when people come to terms with their past.  
Gladiator (2000 film)
 In AD 180, [[Hispania|Hispano-Roman]] General Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return to his home after he leads the [[Roman army]] to victory against the Germanic tribes near [[Vindobona]] on the [[Limes Germanicus]]. Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] tells Maximus that his own son, [[Commodus]], is unfit to rule, and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to help save [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] from corruption. Commodus, upon hearing this, murders his father.  Commodus announces he is the new Emperor and asks Maximus for his loyalty, but the general refuses. Maximus is arrested by guards and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and rides for his home near Trujillo, where he finds his family murdered. Maximus buries his wife and son; then collapses. He is found by slavers who take him to the Roman province of [[Zuccabar|Zucchabar]], where he is sold to a [[Gladiator#Schools_and_training|gladiator trainer]] named Proximo.  Although reluctant at first, Maximus fights in local tournaments and makes friends with two other gladiators: Juba, a [[Numidia]]n; and Hagen, a German. His military skills help him win matches and gain recognition from other gladiators and the crowd. Proximo reveals that he was once a gladiator, and advises Maximus that he must "win the crowd" to win his freedom. Proximo takes his gladiators to fight in Rome's [[Colosseum]], because Commodus has organized 150 days of games.  Disguised by a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in gladiatorial combat in the Colosseum as a [[Sacred Band of Carthage|Carthaginian]] in a re-enactment of the [[Battle of Zama]]. Unexpectedly, Maximus leads his side to victory, and Commodus enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to show himself and give his name; Maximus reveals himself and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let the gladiators live, and the [[Praetorian Guard]] is held back from striking them down.   Maximus's next fight is a victory against a legendary undefeated gladiator. Commodus orders Maximus to kill the gladiator, but Maximus spares his opponent's life; he is called "Maximus the Merciful" by the crowd. Angered at this outcome, Commodus taunts Maximus about his family's deaths, but Maximus turns and walks away.  Maximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. [[Lucilla]], Commodus's sister; Gracchus, an influential [[Senate of the Roman Empire|senator]]; and Maximus meet secretly. Maximus will escape Rome, join his soldiers, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the [[Roman Senate]]. Commodus learns of the plot by threatening Lucilla, and has the Praetorian Guard arrest Gracchus and attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where Cicero is killed.  In an effort to win back the people's approval, Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injuries, Maximus disarms Commodus, whom the Praetorian Guard refuse to aid. Commodus then produces a hidden knife, which Maximus drives into his throat, killing him. Maximus succumbs to his wounds. Before he dies, he asks for political reforms, for his gladiator allies to be freed, and for Senator Gracchus to be reinstated. Maximus's friends and allies honor him as "a soldier of Rome", at Lucilla's behest, and carry his body out of the arena, leaving the dead Commodus behind.  Juba visits the Colosseum at night and buries the figurines of Maximus's wife and son at the spot where he died. Juba promises to see Maximus again, "but not yet".

Jarvis shows them an ancient bowl, carved from a single piece of [[rock crystal]] and embellished with gold, which he asserts is flawless, but Amerigo thinks contains a noticeable crack. Charlotte is indecisive about buying it, and Jarvis sets it aside until she makes up her mind.  Several years pass, during which time Maggie and Amerigo have a son. Charlotte returns to England to pay the family a visit at their country home, but is left with Adam when the couple decide to visit Italy on the spur of the moment. Adam falls in love with Charlotte and proposes marriage, much to the delight of Maggie, who had been concerned about her father's loneliness. After the marriage the two couples find their lives closely interlocked, although the fact Maggie and Adam spend so much time together alienates their spouses. During a weekend house party in the country, Charlotte and Amerigo reignite their affair. Fanny becomes aware of the illicit romance but, wanting to protect Maggie from being hurt, says nothing. As time passes, however, Maggie becomes suspicious of the amount of time her husband and stepmother spend together.  In search of an unusual gift for her father, Maggie chances to wander into Jarvis' shop, and he shows her the bowl he had set aside for Charlotte years ago. Maggie agrees to buy it and asks that it be delivered to her home. When Jarvis discovers the barely discernible crack Amerigo had noticed, he brings it to Maggie himself, reveals the defect, and offers it at half price. While waiting for her in the drawing room, he recognizes Amerigo and Charlotte in photographs on a table, and he innocently reveals they were the couple who originally considered purchasing the bowl, three days before the wedding. Maggie realizes that the two were not meeting for the first time, as she had always assumed. She confronts Amerigo, who confesses to his past with Charlotte and to their affair.  When the Ververs retire to the country, Adam is noticeably distant. He suggests to Charlotte that they return to America to oversee the opening of his museum, though Charlotte is violently opposed to the idea. The tension grows worse after Amerigo and Maggie arrive with the Assinghams. Charlotte tries to convince Amerigo to run away with her, only to be rebuffed and told that he does not love her. Meanwhile Maggie and her father agree to separate for the sake of both their marriages. Although initially in great despair, Charlotte appears to reconcile to the idea of being with Adam, and the film ends with footage of the couple arriving to great fanfare in an unnamed American city.

On the last heist, their antics bring attention by the police, and they narrowly avoid capture, though are forced to abandon the warehouse and the bulk of cars they stole. Detectives Castlebeck ([[Delroy Lindo]]) and Drycoff ([[Timothy Olyphant]]) seize the cars and begin an investigation.   Calitri kidnaps Kip and threatens to kill him for failing the job. Atley, sympathetic to Kip's plight, visit Kip's older brother, Randall "Memphis" Raines ([[Nicolas Cage]]), a former car thief having gone straight years before, and explains the situation. Memphis meets with Calitri to negotiate Kip's release, but in exchange, Calitri forces Memphis to agree to steal the fifty cars within 72 hours or else he will kill Kip. Memphis visits his mentor Otto Halliwell ([[Robert Duvall]]) and they assemble a crew, including Donny Astricky ([[Chi McBride]]), Sphynx ([[Vinnie Jones]]), and Sara "Sway" Wayland ([[Angelina Jolie]]), Memphis' old flame. Kip and his crew also offer to help. Knowing the police will be watchful for the thefts, Memphis suggests to steal all the cars in a twelve-hour period. The group starts to identify the target cars with Memphis giving each a female name. He plans on stealing a modified 1967 [[Ford Shelby GT500]], dubbed "[[Eleanor (car)|Eleanor]]", last, as he considers the car cursed, with all previous attempts to steal one gone awry. As they scout the car locations, Memphis is approached by Castlebeck and Drycoff. While they cannot charge him with any crime, they warn him that they are watching his activities closely. Later, the detectives discover that some of the previous Mercedes heists were accomplished by ordering laser cut transponder keys direct from Hamburg, Germany, and they set up stakeouts to watch those cars specifically.  On the night of the heists, most of the initial thefts go without problems, with the gang members delivering the cars to Calitri's dock. When Memphis and others prepare to steal the Mercedes with the transponder keys, he gets a sense of something amiss, and has the gang abandon those; instead, they successfully scheme a way to obtain those cars from the police impound. Castlebeck, furious that he could not catch Memphis in the act, returns to the seized warehouse to search for any more clues. They discover pieces of a [[blacklight]] lamp, and shortly discover the list of fifty cars written in ultraviolet-sensitive paint on the wall. Aware they cannot watch all those cars, Castleback focuses on the Shelby GT500, knowing Memphis' penchant for this car, and its rarity. They quickly locate the few Shelbys in the city.  Just as Memphis is about to take the Shelby, the detectives arrive. Memphis leads them and their police escort on a dangerous chase through the city, eventually ditching them near the docks. He delivers the damaged car to Calitri, who refuses it since Memphis was twelve minutes late and the car sustained damage. Calitri then has the Shelby [[car crusher|crushed]]. Memphis again pleads for Calitri's mercy as he prepares to kill Memphis instead with a gun, but Kip and a repentant Atley overcome their guards, and force Calitri to flee into his dockside warehouse; Memphis gives chase just as Castlebeck and Drycoff arrive. Memphis and Calitri engage in a game of cat-and-mouse, the noise drawing the detectives inside. Just as Calitri has Memphis cornered, Castlebeck appears, confusing Calitri, who then prepares to execute Castlebeck. Memphis seizes the opportunity to rush Calitri and push him over a railing to his death, saving Castlebeck. Memphis tensely explains the situation to Castlebeck and where they can find the other stolen cars, and Castlebeck reluctantly lets Memphis and Kip go.  The gang celebrates with a barbecue, and as a way of showing thanks, Kip announces he has sold off his chopper motorcycle to buy Memphis a partially-wrecked, but still drive-able, Shelby GT500.

Harry asks if he and Plum can come back to Michel's house for a drink, and Michel accepts.  Michel's summer home is a run-down house that the family plans to fix up. Michel finds that his father has renovated the bathroom without his consent. At dinner, Harry reminds Michel of a poem he had published in a school newspaper, as well as a science fiction story, ''The Flying Monkeys''; he then offers to help the family out however he can, claiming money is no object. The next day, after Michel tries to fill in a deep well in the front yard, the family car dies in the middle of the road, but Harry purchases a new one for them, despite Michel and Claire's protests. Amidst all this, Michel hears from his parents, who insist on coming to his house instead; Michel's father is not supposed to drive, so Michel insists on picking them up. When he brings them to the house, Harry and Plum are there, and Harry sees the pressure they put on Michel.  Harry and Plum leave to stay in a hotel for the night. But Harry sneaks out, steals a van, and goes to Michel's parents' house, claiming Michel is in trouble and they should follow him. They get in the car and follow him, but Harry tricks them into driving off the road and over a cliff, killing them both. Michel is distraught to learn his parents are dead, and the family attends their funeral. After the funeral, Harry gives Michel's brother Eric a ride home. Eric insults Michel and makes fun of his poem. Harry arrives back at the house on his own, claiming Eric thumbed a ride; Michel's daughter sees Harry trying to hide Eric's corpse in the back seat. Harry disposes of the body that night.  Amidst all this family tragedy, Michel feels inspired to start writing ''The Flying Monkeys'' again, but flies into a rage when Claire interrupts his writing. Harry tells Michel that he believes Claire is holding him back. The family have dinner with Plum and Harry again, and Harry tells Plum that Michel insulted her. She runs to the bathroom, crying; Michel goes up to apologize, and Plum kisses him while Harry leaves. Michel apologizes to Claire, and is inspired by Harry's favorite food to write a more personal story called ''The Eggs''. In the night, Harry returns, killing Plum and enlisting Michel for help disposing of her body in the well. When Michel realizes Harry plans to do the same to Claire, he stabs Harry with a screwdriver and drops his body down the same well.  Michel stays up all night filling in the well, surprising Claire, who also tells him that she read ''The Eggs'' and thinks it is brilliant. The film closes as the family goes on another trip in the car Harry bought them.

Help! I'm a Fish
 The film follows the adventures of three children: a skateboarding mischief-maker named Fly, his sweet younger sister, Stella, and their cousin Chuck, a cautious, intelligent and overweight [[genetics]] prodigy. When their babysitter, Aunt Anna, falls asleep, the three children sneak off to go fishing only to stumble across the [[boathouse]] home of Professor MacKrill, an eccentric [[Marine biology|marine biologist]]. Reasoning that [[climate change]] could melt the [[polar icecap]]s within the next century, MacKrill has developed a potion that turns people into fish so they can survive the rising sea level and also an antidote to reverse the process. Unbeknownst to all, Stella drinks the potion mistaking it for lemonade, and painfully transformed into a [[starfish]] and gets tossed out of the window into the sea. Since Stella's transformation was caught on camera, the tragedy is immediately discovered, so Fly, Chuck and Professor MacKrill head out onto the ocean in a desperate search. When a storm blows in, Fly recognizes the futility of their search, drinks the potion and jumps overboard, becoming a "[[California flyingfish|Californian Flyfish]]". The boat capsizes and, because Chuck cannot swim, he's forced to drink the potion to survive, becoming a [[jellyfish]]. The Professor, the boat and all of its contents sink beneath the waves.  A Sand tiger shark and a [[pilot fish]] come across the leaking bottle of antidote and gain the human characteristics of speech by inhaling the liquid. Using his newfound gifts, the pilot fish, who now calls himself Joe, sets about creating an underwater civilization of intelligent fish. They take residence in a sunken [[oil tanker]] and begin to transform it into a monument. Fly, Chuck and Stella are reunited, along with a [[short-snouted seahorse|seahorse]] named Sasha, but are horrified to discover that the antidote has been lost. If they don't find it before tomorrow's sunset, they will stay fish forever. Some traveling fish tell them about Joe and his "magical potion". Thinking it must be the antidote they are looking for, the children travel to Joe's oil tanker empire. At the tanker, Fly attempts to steal and drink the bottle of antidote, but is warned by Chuck that if they turn back into humans this far beneath the ocean, they'll die. Intrigued by this, the villainous Joe has the children arrested and demands they manufacture more of the antidote or he'll have them eaten by the Shark.  Meanwhile, Fly and Stella's parents, Lisa and Bill, arrive home to find Aunt Anna frantic with worry. They find that Fly's fishing equipment is gone, so they head to the beach to search and come across Fly's roller blades instead. There, they meet Professor MacKrill who, having survived the storm, explains that their children have been turned into fish. Though the parents are skeptical at first, a showing of the video recording from earlier validates his story and causes Aunt Anna to faint. He and Bill head out to search for the children in a cobbled-together ship fitted with a large water pump.  The next morning, the children manage to escape with the help of Sasha. With no chance of going back to retrieve the bottle of antidote, they decide that their best hope is to find the ingredients to recreate the antidote themselves. Just as they complete the formula, they are found by Joe, the Shark and their army of crabs. During the standoff, Joe and the Shark get into a heated argument as Joe imbibes more of the potion, developing hands and growing in size. Taking this opportunity to escape, the children are stopped by the leader of the crabs who attacks Fly, striking him with his claw, then drinks the antidote himself, growing in size and developing hands and feet. Just as the new "King Crab" and his army are about to capture the children yet again, a tremendous underwater twister, generated by the Professor's water pump ship, sucks all the crabs (and the Shark, who eats the King Crab in the middle of the twister) to the surface. The Shark remains stuck in the tube.  Now alone, with Fly dying, and only twelve minutes until sundown, Chuck realizes their last hope is to make it back to the Professor's lab, where a whole jug of antidote is stored. Showing unexpected courage and determination, Chuck carries both Fly and Stella through the dangerous seawater intake pipes back to the lab. However, they are pursued by Joe, who overpowers them and steals the antidote. While Chuck fights off the Professor's escaped [[piranha]]s, Fly manages to catch up to the fleeing Joe as he escapes into a water intake pipe and tricks him into drinking enough antidote to become mostly human by asking him various questions on science. After drinking some of the antidote to answer the questions correctly, Joe becomes near-human, but he is no longer able to breathe underwater, thus, he drowns.  Fly drags the jug of antidote back to the lab and collapses. Chuck uncorks the jug just as Lisa and Aunt Anna open the door to the laboratory, causing everyone to get swept away. As the water drains away, Chuck and Stella have become human once more and are reunited with their parents. After a few tense moments in which a stuffed fish is mistaken for the limp body of Fly, the human Fly emerges from one of the lab's pipes (with a broken leg). Later on, while playing by the beach, Stella is reunited with Sasha, who is turned into an actual horse by the Professor and Chuck. We zoom out to see the beach with Stella riding Sasha in horse form as the film ends.  
Hera Pheri (2000 film)
  The plot revolves around an eccentric trio, consisting of a comically hilarious but kind hearted garage owner named Baburao Ganpatrao Apte ([[Paresh Rawal]]), a crafty and cunning loafer named Raju ([[Akshay Kumar]]) and a simple and struggling pauper named Shyam ([[Sunil Shetty]]) who find themselves trapped in crazy shenanigans including hilarious bits from Rawal himself.  The film begins with Shyam searching for a job at a bank which he find that is given to some girl named Anuradha Shivshankar Panikar ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]) even though Shyam's father died in the bank due to a fire. The manager ([[Asrani]]) tells Shyam that despite knowing the truth, he is unable to do anything further. Shyam walks off in a huff and accidentally bumps into Raju. Shyam mistakes Raju for a pickpocket and begins to chase him. Raju eventually gets away clean. Raju has his own troubles, dealing with his daydreams and unfriendly and disappointed people he is working for. He doesn't seem to keep a job alive and thus faces many problems.  Shyam then approaches a garage owner by the name of Baburao Ganpatrao Apte, and manages to get a room on rent by compromising on the amount for Baburao's alcohol. Unknowingly for him Raju is staying in the same house on rent, which he hasn't paid for the last two years. The trio falls into hilarious situations that usually involve Raju instigating Shyam and purposefully trying to create a tandem that Baburao, fondly called as Babu Bhaiyya has to resolve. During one such fight, Anuradha intervenes and tries Shyam to sign the Non-Objection Certificate, so that she could have the job at the bank. When Shyam refuses, Raju makes a plot to make him sign the papers. Shyam eventually finds out that Raju made him sign the papers and that is when the rivalry between the two commences. An old friend of Shyam's, Khadak Singh ([[Om Puri]]) comes to Shyam's place asking to return his money so that he can marry off his sister and afford the dowry.  Shyam finds out that Raju has been deceiving his mother by posing as an engineer and creates an uncomfortable situation for Raju as he calls his mother fake while being inebriated. Raju retaliates, saying he just wants to see his dying mother happy and nothing else.  Anuradha prepares a job resignation meanwhile and gives it to Shyam, who in return tears it up because of her mentally ailing mother and the debts to be paid to the debtors.  Their life takes an unexpected turn when they get a call from Kabeera ([[Gulshan Grover]]) which is a wrong number actually meant for the owner of Star fisheries, Mr. Devi Prasad ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]). The wrong number is because of the misprint in the phone directory, which renders Star fisheries' number as Star garage's and vice versa. Kabeera, a terrorist cum kidnapper, tells who he thinks is Devi Prasad that his granddaughter is kidnapped and asks for ransom. Raju overhears the entire conversation going between Kabeera and Shyam and decides to play a game.  The game involves Shyam calling Devi Prasad posing as the kidnappers and asking for double the ransom amount. This will make their monetary problems disappear. Shyam and Baburao initially repel the idea and try to go the faithful way. But Raju in turn convinces them that even though wrong, this is a golden chance to earn money. Both relent and phone the real Devi Prasad and ask for double ransom. Their first attempt gets foiled, by the police and Kabeera informs them that the ransom has been doubled. They phone Devi Prasad again. This time they ask for a foolproof double ransom.  They reveal their true identities to Devi Prasad to win his confidence and try to save the girl from the kidnappers. But the girl recognizes Shyam as an imposter and Kabeera gets alerted. A huge fight involving the police, Kabeera's gang members and Khadak Singh's men, infuriated by the delay in the money return intervene the fight, takes place. The scenes are hilariously choreographed, especially those involving Baburao losing his spectacles and accdentally firing an AK-47 all over the floor. The girl is saved by the three and returned to Devi Prasad. Baburao and Shyam go home happily intending to find Raju with the money, but they find him missing. They call the police and Raju is found to be gone to return the money of the debtors.  In the end, Devi Prasad comes to the trio's rescue and convinces the police that it was all a misunderstanding and saves the three and they go home, richer than ever.  
Hey Ram
  The movie begins at present day with Saket Ram ([[Kamal Haasan]]), an 89-year-old Hindu man at his death bed in [[Madras]]. He is being taken care of by his grandson Saket Ram Junior, a famous novelist who writes historical fiction, and their family doctor, Munawar. Ram Jr. explains how he grew up listening to his grandfather's stories. He then narrates one of his grandfather's strangest stories that he plans to use for his next novel. As Ram Jr. narrates the story, Ram is reminded of it.  The scene reverts to the 1940s, when he and his good friend, Amjad Ali Khan ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) are archaeologists working together under their boss, [[Mortimer Wheeler]], in [[Mohenjo-daro]] in the [[Sindh|Sindh province]] in what was then North-West India. Relations are pleasant between the Indians and the English. Saket and Amjad do not approve of [[partition of India|partition]] and the [[creation of Pakistan|creation]] of [[Pakistan]]. Although many [[Indian Muslims]] plan to move to Pakistan, Amjad decides to stay in India as he believes it is his homeland and he does not wish to live under [[Sharia]] law.  After the archaeological site is shut down out of fear of riots, young Ram returns to Calcutta to be with his wife, Aparna ([[Rani Mukherjee]]), a school teacher. On his way home, he witnesses the riots and chaos over the issue of the formation of Pakistan and the call by [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]], the founder of modern Pakistan, for [[Direct Action Day|"Direct Action"]]. While out to get some food, Ram manages to save an innocent [[Sikh]] girl from the hands of a Muslim gang. When he returns to his house, he finds a group of Muslims entering his house. They brutally rape and murder Aparna. Saket, unable to cope with his tragic loss, kills the Muslims who raped and killed his wife in a fit of rage.  Outside his house, he runs into Shriram Abhyankar ([[Atul Kulkarni]]), who is part of a Hindu nationalist group determined to fight the Muslims' malice and persecution with similar brute force, and assassinate Gandhi for what they perceive to be his treachery towards Hindu dominated India. Gandhi wants Hindus and Muslims to co-exist peacefully with hope of winning over the hearts of the rioters through sheer self-pity, but Abhyankar and his fellow extremists have lost patience at what they deemed Gandhi's unreasonable stand to appease the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and their demand for Pakistan.  Back in his hometown of [[Thanjavur]], Ram's Uncle Bahsyahm and Aunt Vasanthato urge him to remarry. He is then married to the daughter of family friends, Mythili ([[Vasundhara Das]]). While his wedding is being celebrated across the village, Ram tells his childhood friends Vedha and Yegham that he has no reason to be happy since the world's biggest political divorce is going on with the separation of [[Pakistan]] in the north. During his first night, he learns that Mythili, like her family, are supporters of Gandhi  and that the Mahatma will be visiting [[Calcutta]] a few days later on the anniversary of the bloody riots. Ram travels to [[Calcutta]] alone and learns that a Mr. Nair now lives at his old apartment. Nair gives him a goddess painting drawn by Aparna not long before her death. Later that night, Ram joins a mob that confronts Gandhi and [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy|Suhrawardy]], then [[Prime Minister of Bengal|Chief Minister of Bengal]], about the bloody riots. When questioned whether they take full responsibility for the riots, both of them accept and ask for forgiveness. The mob forgives them, but Ram refuses to.  Although Ram remains aloof at first, he slowly falls in love with Mythili. However, on their honeymoon in  [[Maharashtra]], Ram and Mythili bump into a disguised Abhyankar, who introduces them to a dethroned Maharaja. During a hunting trip with Abhyankar and the Maharaja, Ram is reunited with an old friend from [[Calcutta]], Manohar Lalwani ([[Saurabh Shukla]]) who lost his family and home in the riots. After seeing Lalwani's misery, Ram realizes he has still not gotten over Aparna's murder. Under Abhyankar's influence Ram comes to the belief that Mahatma Gandhi is solely responsible for the division of India and of the two religions and also of having supported whom they viewed as the enemy. Hindu fundamentalists, including the Maharaja and Abhyankar, are furious and plot to murder Gandhi. Ram unwittingly becomes a part of their militant organisation that plots to do away with Gandhi. Due to a horse-riding accident, Abhyankar is left a quadriplegic and has Ram swear that he will carry on his work, that of killing the Mahatma.  Back in present day, Ram Senior's situation worsens. Ram Junior tries to convince his father Mohan to accompany them to the hospital, but he is uninterested for some unknown reason. In the end, Ram Jr. and Munavar take him to the hospital but are stopped by the police  since there are bomb blasts in Madras due to Hindu-Muslim communal riots. Ram asks "Even now?". A Muslim soldier, Ibrahim makes them hide in an underground shelter for their safety. As they try to stay silent to avoid being attacked by the mob, Ram reminisces about how he plotted to kill Gandhi many decades ago.  Back in newly independent India, Ram begins to prepare to assassinate Gandhi once he returns to Madras. A pregnant Mythili becomes worried as her husband grows more distant and invites her parents and in-laws over to cheer him up. However, Ram has made up his mind to end Gandhi's life and leaves home for Varanasi, where he goes through a purification ritual. Then, he heads for Delhi and unknowingly stays at the same hotel as another fundamentalist planning to kill Gandhi, [[Nathuram Godse]]. When the police arrive to question Godse, a paranoid Ram hides his gun in a truck. Later on, Ram goes to the soda factory in [[Chandni Chowk]] where the truck was heading to.  In Chandni Chowk, Ram is reunited with Amjad, who takes him to the soda factory. It is revealed that many Muslims civilians, including Amjad's wife Nafisa and their children are hiding there out of fear of being attacked by Hindus during curfew. When it is discovered that Ram came there for a gun, the Muslims became suspicious that he might be out to kill them, attack him. A fight ensues that triggers a series of violent events in the area. While trying to escape both Hindu and Muslim mobs, Amjad finds out that Ram is in Delhi to assassinate Gandhi and he tries to convince his friend to not do it. He reveals that his father did not die of natural causes. He was murdered by a Hindu mob.  He begs him, kneeling and asking forgiveness for Aparna's death. He says he forgives Ram for his father's. Then he asks Ram to shoot him and tells him that he will take Ram's bullet if his death will grant both Hindus and Muslims peace. He says that he is willing to die if his death gets rid of the hatred that has turned Ram mad.  Just then, they are cornered by a Hindu mob who try to kill Amjad, but he is saved by Ram. Amjad is struck on the back of the head and Ram takes him back to the soda factory. Together, they then help protect the Muslims hiding in the soda factory until the authorities arrive to control the situation. Amjad is shot in the leg.  Amjad is fatally injured and is questioned by Officer Rao about the man who started the violence. He is asked about the fake name, Bhaivan, that Ram used since he arrived at his hotel.  Before dying, Amjad lies that he has never seen that man before, and all he knows is his brother Ram who despite everything, saved his life. He dies holding his brother's hand.  Ram then bumps into father-in-law and his friend who are there to meet Gandhi. He learns that his uncle and aunt have died after learning he has left. Gandhi requests to see Ram to invite him on his long walk to Pakistan after finding out he helped save innocent Muslims.  Ram ultimately changes his mind about Gandhi after seeing that his teachings are all about love and non-violence. He decides against assassinating the leader, and attempts to confess the truth to him in order to beg for forgiveness. However, it is too late as Gandhi is eventually killed by another assassin, Nathuram Godse. Ironically, Gandhi dies without his famous last words: "Hey Ram!" as popularly believed, and as in Richard Attenborough's film Gandhi.  Then on,  Ram lives by [[Gandhism|Gandhian principles]]. As the situation on the streets starts to cool down, Ram whispers his last words to his grandson and eventually dies. Before Ram Junior leaves with his grandfather's body, he learns that the soldier's name is Ibrahim and that he is a Muslim.  During his funeral, Gandhi's great-grandson [[Tushar Gandhi|Tushar]] comes and sees Ram Senior's private room which is full of historical photos. Ram Junior hands over Gandhi's footwear and spectacles which his late grandfather had previously collected from the place of the shootout and had treasured throughout his life.  
Heavy Metal 2000
 In ages past, a malevolent race called the Arakacians discovered a place where space-time leaked a type of fluid. This fluid granted immortality to anyone who consumed it. The Arakacians built an empire and enslaved the known universe for centuries; they were unstoppable. The Arakacians were finally vanquished after the fountain chamber (where they gathered the water of life) was sealed by freedom fighters. The key to the chamber, a glowing crystal that will lead the bearer back to the fountain, but would drive anyone who possessed it insane, was cast into space and lost among the stars.  In a present-day [[asteroid]] excavation, space crewman Tyler and his colleague find the key by accident. Tyler touches the key and instantly goes insane. Tyler kills his mining partner, and takes over the ship, killing most of the resisting crew except for Dr. Schechter, and the pilots Lambert and Germain.<ref name="variety"></ref> His search for the planet with the fountain leads to Eden,<ref name="badmovies"></ref> a planet that is designated F.A.K.K.² (Federation-Assigned Ketogenic Killzone to the second level), but has inhabitants whose bodies carry the immortality fluid. Tyler invades Eden, and kills many of the Edenites, capturing some so he can extract the immortality fluids from their bodies. He also keeps the attractive Kerrie for his own sexual purposes. When Germain resists the idea, he is left on Eden.  Kerrie's beautiful sister Julie, who survived the attack, finds Germain and they team up to follow Tyler. At a renegade [[space station]], Julie finds Tyler at a restaurant and critically injures him. However, he ingests a vial with the immortality serum and heals instantly.<ref name="variety"/> In the ensuing gunfight, Tyler blows up the club. Julie escapes the explosion; she and Germain board a shuttle-craft that latches onto Tyler's ship with a tractor beam before it jumps into [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]]. Discovering them mid-travel, Tyler tries to shake them off, but the fight causes the hyperspace to collapse and the two ships to crash.  Julie wakes up on the desert planet called Oroboris, and meets a mysterious cloaked sage named Odin and his assistant, Zeek, a rock-like creature, both of whom are guardians of the ancient fountain. Elsewhere, Tyler's ship has been destroyed and most of his crew and abductees are dead. Tyler orders Dr. Schechter to extract Kerrie's fluids. He explores the planet and finds a race of reptilian beings, which he conquers by defeating their champion and then their leader in a death match. Julie enters the reptilian city in disguise as a woman that the reptiles found for Tyler. That night, she seduces Tyler, but when she tries to kill him, Zeek captures her and takes her back to Odin. Julie infiltrates Tyler's ship where she discovers Kerrie is still alive. She takes out Dr. Schechter, frees Kerrie, and escapes as the complex explodes. As a result, Tyler vows to make Julie immortal so he can "screw her and kill her every hour of every day for all eternity." With only three vials of serum, he orders his troops to storm the citadel where the immortality fountain is located.  At the citadel, Julie undergoes a ritual where she is outfitted in armor. She, Kerrie, and Germain help the fountain's guardians defend against Tyler's army. In the fighting, Lambert suffers a near-fatal injury and while reaching for Tyler's last vial of immortality serum, he knocks it loose from Tyler's belt and it breaks on the ground. Tyler, enraged, kills Lambert for the blunder. Tyler then walks to the pit of immortality and is about to put the crystal into the fountain's final lock but is stopped by Julie. She stabs Tyler in the left eye before he is able to place the crystal in the lock. A fight ensues, but Tyler appears to have the advantage, until Odin intervenes, which allows Julie to finally kill Tyler. After Tyler is left dead. Odin, throwing off his cloak, reveals himself to be the last of the Arakacians. He has been in hiding all these centuries, waiting for someone to find the chamber key and be drawn to the fountain. He intends to claim it as his own, and reestablish the Arakacian empire. However, Zeek pulls the crystal key from the pedestal, locking Odin inside the fountain chamber forever, and flies into outer space. As Germain and Kerrie help Julie to her feet, Zeek envelops the crystal into himself and becomes a new asteroid to hide the key for all time.<ref name="badmovies"/>

By the turn of the century, Kell has 661 Immortal kills (compared to 262 for Connor MacLeod, and 174 for Duncan MacLeod).  Ten years before the present-day events of the film, Kell orchestrates the death of Connor's adopted daughter [[Rachel Ellenstein]]. Heartbroken, Connor departs for [[Watcher (Highlander)#The Sanctuary|The Sanctuary]], where Immortals are under surveillance by a subgroup of [[Watcher (Highlander)|Watchers]] to prevent [[Immortal (Highlander)#The Prize|The Prize]] from being won.  A decade later, Kell and his disciples attack the Sanctuary, and Connor is believed to have been beheaded along with the other Immortals there. [[Duncan MacLeod]] ([[Adrian Paul]]), compelled by a vision he has of the slaughter, begins to investigate. Meanwhile, Mathew Hale, the watcher supervising the sanctuary, looks on at the carnage, and decides that they will now turn to "volunteers" to refill their test-subjects' numbers. Duncan goes to see [[Methos]], who tells him about the Sanctuary. Duncan cannot believe that Connor would even go to such a place. He later leaves London for New York, where he goes to Connor's loft, which was destroyed in the explosion that killed Rachel. Sensing an Immortal, he turns to see Kate ([[Lisa Barbuscia]]), his wife from 200 years before. Then Kell's posse arrives, and fights Duncan (disregarding the rule of one-on-one combat). The fighting stops when Kell arrives, but Carlos shoots Duncan, who falls on a spike, killing him. Kell is furious with Carlos, and beheads him: as the [[Quickening (Highlander)|quickening]] begins, a van drives up to where Duncan fell, and takes him away.  Later on, Duncan wakes up, only to realize that he has been taken by Watchers who want to keep him in the Sanctuary so that he does not win the Prize. He is later saved with the help of [[Methos]] and Joe. He discovers Connor was spared by Kell, so as to allow the evil Immortal to make Connor's life even more miserable. Kell wants to kill Duncan in order to torture Connor, and given the number of Quickenings he has received, this seems quite likely to occur. Additionally, Connor is too guilt-ridden by the deaths of all his loved ones to stand up to Kell by himself. Duncan later confronts Kate (now using the alias "Faith") at a fashion shoot, and asks her why she is with Kell. She tells him how much she hates the fact that she will never have children or grow old and die, and believes that Kell understands her pain. Duncan must earn her forgiveness, or face her as an embittered part of Kell's faction. Later on in his hotel room, Kate arrives after having a chat with Kell, and the two make love. Though it would appear that she has forgiven him, it is not the case, and she tells Duncan that she will never forgive him; Duncan tells her that it is never too late for redemption, and that he will wait, even if it takes years or centuries.  Ultimately, Kell executes his group in a mock [[Last Supper]] to gain their powers, including possibly Faith, and Connor convinces Duncan that Connor must allow himself to be beheaded in order for Duncan to have enough power to rival Kell. After an emotional good-bye, Duncan follows Connor's advice, and beheads his beloved clansman.  Soon after, Duncan and Kell engage in a final battle. At first, Kell easily overpowers Duncan, even when MacLeod attempts a supposedly-unbeatable sword move that Connor taught him. Just before Duncan's impending death at the hands of Kell, Connor's spirit helps give Duncan the strength to continue. Duncan then kills Kell by jumping over him and decapitating him as he turns around. Duncan absorbs all of Kell's massive power. He then goes to [[Glen Coe]], [[Scotland]] to bury Connor next to Connor's first wife [[Heather MacLeod|Heather]]. Kate appears and explains to Duncan that Kell spared her life. Kate and Duncan share a kiss, suggesting that they will reconcile their marriage and live together forever.

Hollow Man
 Scientist Sebastian Caine (Bacon)  has developed a serum that can make a subject invisible. His team of scientists, which includes ex-girlfriend Linda McKay (Shue) and Matt Kensington (Brolin), eventually enable the serum to work on a female gorilla and restore the animal back to visibility. Sebastian once again becomes obsessed with Linda while unbeknownst to him, she has become involved with Matt. Instead of reporting his success to the military, Sebastian lies to the oversight committee, which includes his mentor Howard Kramer (Devane), convincing his team to go right into human testing. The procedure is performed on Sebastian himself. Despite the pain he undergoes, it is successful and Sebastian turns completely invisible. He then enjoys sneaking around the lab in order to scare and play pranks on his fellow co-workers. They become a little concerned that he is taking it too far. After three days, however, he is unable to revert to visibility.  Sebastian is quarantined in the laboratory due to his condition and the other researchers construct a latex mask for him to wear around the lab. Unable to cope with the isolation, he defies instructions and leaves the building. The guard working there is also very suspicious but before he can do anything, Sebastian gets into his car and drives off to his apartment to bring some things back to the lab. There, he happens to notice his neighbor disrobing and goes to her apartment where he rapes her. Linda warns him that if he leaves again, she and Matt will tell the committee about the experiment. Ignoring their threat, Sebastian assembles a device that runs a video loop of his heat signature in his quarters. He leaves the lab again and spies on Linda and Matt, becoming enraged when he sees them having sex.  The team soon discover that they have been watching a recording and that Sebastian has been escaping without their knowledge. Linda and Matt go to Kramer's house and confess their experiments. After they leave, Kramer attempts to warn his colleagues but Sebastian, who has followed Linda and Matt to the house, cuts off Kramer's phone connection before drowning him in his own pool. The next day, Sebastian waits until all of the team is in the lab and then disables the phones and the elevator codes except for his own. He removes his clothing and latex mask and, invisible, decides to go on a killing spree, with Janice being his first victim. He also changes the security codes of all staff.  Linda and the others hide in the lab, while Matt and Carter take [[tranquilizer gun]]s to hunt for Sebastian, using thermal imaging goggles. While on top of a pipe, Sebastian throws Carter toward a steel bar, which hits his [[carotid artery]], and leaves him mortally wounded. Matt and Sebastian get into a fight; just before the former is killed, Linda drags him to safety. After Carter dies from his injuries, Sarah heads to the freezer to get blood for a transfusion but is killed by Sebastian. He then kills Frank with a crowbar when he lets his guard down, and locks an injured Matt and Linda in the freezer-store room, leaving them to freeze to death. Linda then constructs an electromagnet using a [[defibrillator]] and other equipment to open the freezer door. She then gathers materials to assemble a flamethrower. Sebastian goes to the lab, where he creates [[nitroglycerin]] and puts it in a [[centrifuge]] with a timer which is meant to destroy the facility after he leaves; he also smashes the keyboard so nobody can stop the machine.  Just as he enters the elevator to leave, Linda appears and fires the flamethrower at him. Sebastian barely manages to escape the flames and the two fight. Before Sebastian can kill Linda, Matt appears and hits Sebastian with the crowbar. Sebastian recovers and approaches Matt and Linda from behind with the crowbar but Matt deflects the blow, throwing Sebastian into a nearby circuit box, apparently electrocuting him and rendering him partially visible. Linda and Matt find the nitroglycerin about to explode and decide to climb up the elevator shaft to escape. The two are almost out when Sebastian, despite his injuries, grabs Linda's ankle. He pulls her off the ladder and onto the top of the elevator and forcibly kisses her one last time, before she grabs the elevator cable and unhooks the tether holding the car. Sebastian tries to grab a hold of Linda's foot but he pulls off her boot and Sebastian falls to his death into the explosion in the shaft below. Linda and Matt emerge from the burning laboratory and emergency personnel take them away in an ambulance.

He seems to have escaped pursuit until they tail him again and the car hightails into a river. Kool starts to narrate his story, telling the audience "I'm not surprised this road is ending, I've been on this road to nowhere for a while. My name is Kool, they say I'm a thug...I say I was made into one." as the movie flashes back 6 months earlier.

She tells Kool to take her daughter to the museum since she said Kool was an "artist." The movie then skips ahead to Kool sparring with other students in a Kenpo-karate class which introduces Master Keaton ([[Jeff Speakman]]) as his mentor. Kool has made his transition from a brown belt to a black belt. The movie then skips to the next day and introduces Tyrel ([[Mystikal]]), and he is arguing with C-Dawg about Mike Tyson biting Holyfield's ear off in the boxing match. Kool changes the subject and turns on a song that he wrote in which his friends do not give him credit. LaShawna comes by and they go over to Kool's house. LaShawna remembers his birthday and has a cake she baked for him.  The movie cuts to an office at the LAPD precinct.

They are interrupted by Tyrel knocking on the door telling Kool to hurry up because something big is about to go down, and C-Dawg and Remo are in the middle of it. LaShawna hears Tyrel screaming at the door and she gives Kool the go ahead despite Kool not wanting her to walk home by herself.  As she is walking home, she witnesses a stabbing and discovers the victim is a cop as he dies in her arms. As the officer dies Officer Mack, who is a dirty cop, brandishes his gun, which causes LaShawna to run away from the crime scene just as help is arriving, and LaShawna runs all the way home where she is apprehended and taken into custody. Kool arrives and Eddy (Anthony Boswell) explains that she has just been charged with murder despite he and Kool knowing that she would never kill anyone. Eddy reluctantly offers to help, but can't due to the fact that it isn't his murder case. Kool wants to prove her innocence, and Tully ([[Gary Busey]]), the cynical detective in charge, ignores LaShawna's case but uses Kool to break up an incipient crime operation, which has Saint ([[Clifton Powell]]) jailed and LaShawna's certain release. She's in danger because the guilty parties fear that the officer talked before he died.  While in jail, pregnant with Kool's child and awaiting a hearing and legal help, she's beaten to death by Mack. While at LaShawna's funeral, Officer Mack pulls out an Uzi and fires upon the funeral. Kool gets into a hearse and gives chase to Mack, Kool eventually catches up to Mack and destroys the van he is driving, killing him.

Kool is eventually pushed over the edge by a pair of racist cops and decides to start his own gang called "Hot Boyz," who turn out to be the toughest new gang in the city.  As the Hot Boyz continue their rise to dominance, they are all at a club when Tyrel comes and sits at the bar with them, and tells them that Saint gets released from prison at 9 o'clock in the morning. Tyrel and Remo insist that they kill him before he puts together another crew and there will be a turf war between Saint and the Hot Boyz. Moe ([[Master P]]) is an informant who is helping out Officer Roberts ([[C. Thomas Howell]]) with the case at hand, Moe tells Roberts exactly what he wants to know and Moe skips town after it happens.  Pee Wee makes a deal with Saint, who lets him in his organization when he told about the hit the Hot Boyz were planning on him. C-Dawg finds out what Pee Wee did, then he and Kool confront him about it. Kool reaches into his pocket, and Pee Wee, thinking Kool is about to kill him, runs for his own safety and is shot and killed by C-Dawg. Kool reveals that he was going to send him home with a plane ticket.  Saint finds the warehouse where the Hot Boyz do their business and has his crew, and the corrupt police working with them, draw their guns and get ready to kill. A 10-minute gunfight ensues, in which most of the Hot Boyz are killed or injured. Kool and Tully have a standoff in which Kool wins due to an assist from an injured C-Dawg, and in the end as he jumps out of the window, hops into a car and jumps into the river, he tells the audience that "There was time when the world was mine; LaShawna, me, and our baby, the future looked so good, and now I'm on a dead impact and a crash course with destiny." He also tells the audience that it's funny when you're thirty-eight feet below, all the guns, and the money in the world doesn't even matter any more, and that you find yourself thinking about the strangest things,noting "I found myself thinking about justice, and that I realized I had not found any for myself, I had just been sinking deeper and deeper, and that now all I wonder is if I had any air to get away, will I have anything to live for any more." He tells the audience that eventually he was found and locked in prison for 30 years without parole until Eddy got him out on a legal loophole after only serving 5 years in prison, getting a second chance to live a good life - a life that LaShawna and the baby would have approved of.  As the movie ends, it shows Kool sitting by LaShawna's gravesite and having flashbacks of her, after which he tells the audience that a good life is worth living, because as long as he lives the memory of LaShawna lives on forever, and that love is something to believe in, and all he has now is memories.

How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)
  All the people in [[Whoville]], called the Whos, enjoy celebrating Christmas with much happiness and joy, except the [[Grinch]], a misanthropic creature who despises Christmas and the Whos and occasionally pulls dangerous and harmful practical jokes on them with vengeance.  As a result, no one likes or cares for the Grinch.  Meanwhile, six-year-old Cindy Lou believes everyone is missing the point about Christmas by being more concerned about the gifts and festivities.  She herself has a face-to-face encounter with the Grinch at the [[post office]], in which he reluctantly saves her life, and she becomes interested in his history.  She asks everyone what they know about him and discovers that he has a tragic past.  The Grinch actually arrived in Whoville by mistake when he was a baby, and was adopted by two elderly sisters.  Although he showed some sadistic tendencies as a child, he was rather good and timid and not as cruel as he would later become.  In school, the Grinch was bullied by Augustus May Who, who grew up to become mayor of Whoville, and his other classmates because of his appearance, with the exception of Martha May Whovier, for whom both the Grinch and May Who had feelings.  One Christmas season, the Grinch made a gift for Martha, but attempted to shave his face after May Who made fun of him for having a "beard", cutting himself by accident.  When his classmates saw his cut face the next morning, May Who and the others ridiculed him.  He lost his temper, trashed the classroom, and fled to live on Mount Crumpit, a mountain north of Whoville.  Cindy Lou, inspired by this story, decides to make the Grinch the main participant of the Whobilation, much to the displeasure of Mayor May Who, who reluctantly agrees after being pressured by the townspeople, who have been warmed by Cindy Lou's generous spirit.  When Cindy Lou goes to Mount Crumpit and offers an invitation to the Grinch, he turns her down.  He changes his mind, however, due to the promise of an award, the presence of Martha at the celebration, and the chance to upset the Mayor.  Just as the Grinch is enjoying himself, May Who gives him an electric shaver as a present, reminding him of his humiliation at school.  May Who then asks Martha to marry him, promising her a new car in return.  In response, the Grinch berates the Whos, and criticizes Christmas, claiming that the holiday is only about gifts that they will just dispose of later, in the hopes of making them too ashamed to celebrate the holiday.  He then goes on to ruin the party by burning the Christmas tree and causing chaos throughout Whoville, but his actions prove to be fruitless as the Whos have a spare tree, which the Grinch sees them erect before he leaves.  May Who then accuses Cindy Lou for inviting the Grinch, making her feel ashamed.  The Grinch, knowing that his attack has failed to remove the Whos' Christmas spirit, instead concocts a plan to steal all of their presents while they are sleeping.  Creating a Santa suit and sleigh with his own dog Max as a "reindeer", the Grinch travels to Whoville and steals all of the Whos' Christmas gifts.  He is almost discovered by Cindy Lou, but lies to her in order to escape.  On Christmas morning, the Whos discover the Grinch's scheme, and May Who blames the whole disaster on Cindy Lou.  However, her father, Lou Lou Who, the Whoville postmaster, finally stands up to him, and reminds everyone that they still have Christmas spirit, and that the principal meaning of Christmas is to spend it with family and friends.  The people agree and begin to sing.  Hoping that the change of mood would inspire the Grinch, Cindy Lou goes to Mount Crumpit to find him.  The Grinch intends to push the stolen gifts off the top of the mountain.  However, he hears the joyful singing of the Whos and knows he has failed again.  Infuriated, the Grinch then has an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] about what Christmas is really about: not [[Materialism|material gifts]], but spending time with loved ones, an insight that profoundly inspires him, and [[Cardiomegaly|causes his heart to grow]] to three times its original size.  When the sleigh full of stolen gifts begins to go over the edge of the cliff, the Grinch desperately tries to save them to no avail.  However, when he realizes that Cindy Lou has come to wish him a merry Christmas and is in danger of falling off the cliff with the sleigh, the Grinch finds enough strength to lift the sleigh, the gifts, and Cindy Lou to safety.  The Grinch returns to Whoville with Max, Cindy, and the gifts.  He confesses to the burglary, tearfully apologizes for his actions towards the Whos, and surrenders himself to the police as they arrive, but the Whos reconcile with him, much to May Who's dismay.  Martha turns down May Who's proposal and decides that she would rather stay with the Grinch instead.  The redeemed Grinch, along with Max, starts a new life with the Whos, commemorating the Christmas feast with them in his cave.

Later, at the home they have shared for 30 years, Abby falls from a ladder. At the hospital, the  doctors tell Edith that Abby may have suffered a stroke. Edith asks to see Abby but is not permitted as she is not a family member. Instead she spends the night in the waiting room and in the morning she learns from a more sympathetic nurse that Abby died alone during the night, and none of the hospital workers informed her after it had happened.  Edith telephones Abby's nephew, Ted ([[Paul Giamatti]]), her only living relative, to tell him the news. Before Ted and his family come for the funeral, Edith removes all traces that they were a couple. She makes it look like they had separate bedrooms and removes photographs of the two of them together. At the house afterwards, Ted and Edith talk about the fact that the house was in Abby's name. Although Edith contributed equally to the mortgage, she legally owns no part of it. As Alice packs up Abby's belongings, Ted tells Edith that he would consider letting Edith staying in the house and paying him rent. Edith tells him that Abby would have wanted her to stay in the house, as that was what they always talked about. Ted eventually tells her that it would be better if he sells the house and she finds a place of her own although he says that he'll wait till she finds a new place before putting the house on the market.

The others soon leave and Linda stays behind and dances with Amy. Later, Amy gives Linda a ride home on her motorcycle and they kiss. Linda invites Amy to return the next day.  The next day Linda and the others are arguing with a woman from the feminist group when Amy arrives. Linda is embarrassed and is short with Amy who quickly leaves. Linda's friends tease her about Amy and question how they can be taken seriously as feminists if they associate with people like Amy. They cannot understand why a woman would dress like a man when they have fought so hard to escape such stereotypical roles.  Linda goes to Amy's house and apologizes. They sleep together. The next morning Linda sees a picture of Amy as a child, dressed like a boy. She asks Amy if Amy is supposed to be the man and Linda the woman. Amy says no and accuses Linda of being afraid that people will know what she is if she is seen with Amy.  Amy goes to Linda's house for dinner. Linda urges her friends to give Amy a chance but an awkward evening deteriorates when Linda's friends criticize Amy and try to make her change her clothes. Amy leaves, upset.

Brittany Foster, a young woman who lives in the area, befriends Adrien and takes her under her wing, accepting her as part of a clique of wealthy teenagers. Brittany's group of friends make comments about how much Adrien looks like Brittany's older sister who had moved away.

An Ideal Husband (2000 film)

It transpires that Robert's wealth stems from [[insider trading]] concerning a proposed canal project at an unspecified location.  She attempts to blackmail Sir Robert into supporting the project - in which she has invested heavily - and in desperation, Sir Robert turns for help to his friend Lord Goring, an apparently idle philanderer. Goring knows the lady from years before.  After several varieties of machination, the story ends happily. Lord Goring marries Robert's sister Mabel, Mrs. Chevely is outsmarted, and Lady Chiltern retains her faith in her husband's honour and 'idealism'.  
In Absentia (film)
 A seated woman, alone in a chair at a table in a room on one of the top floors of an asylum, repeatedly writes on a piece of paper and sharpens pencils. The pencil point often breaks under her fingers' force. She places the broken points outside the window on the sill. A satanic figure is somewhere nearby, animated and made of straw or clay, not flesh. A spotlight lights up her window randomly. She finishes her writing, tears the paper from the pad, folds it, places it in an envelope, and slips it through a slot that contains many more letters. Great emphasis is placed on extreme close-ups of the objects central to her existence: the pencils, the sharpener, the paper, her cramped, clenching hands, blackened fingernails, endless stubs of broken-off lead, and finally the letters themselves, packaged up and 'posted' uselessly into a grandfather clock.<ref name="imbd"></ref>  
Ichigensan
 The main protagonist, 'Boku', is a foreign student in Japan, who wishes to blend in with insular [[Kyoto]] society but finds himself rejected as a [[gaijin]] (outsider). Frustrated, he volunteers to read books to the blind - partly to assist his own studies of Japanese literature - and finds acceptance with the young, beautiful Kyoko. She soon tests his mettle by choosing erotic works, and eventually a love affair develops. This is however challenged by cultural misunderstandings and prejudice on both sides.  Similar to Elizabeth Katayama ([[Elizabeth Kata]])'s novel ''Be Ready with Bells and Drums'', which was made into the award-winning film ''[[A Patch of Blue]]'', the story deals with themes of how perceived handicaps and prejudice can counteract each other and resolve feelings of isolation or alienation, specifically in the example of being 'blind to colour'. The setting also resembles [[The Reader]] (Der Vorleser) by [[Bernhard Schlink]] (made into a [[The Reader (2008 film)|2008 film]], as well as [[Raymond Jean]]'s novella 'La lectrice' (translated as 'Reader for Hire' and made into a [[The Reader (1988 film)|1988 film]], as all cover the little-known area of reading to the visually impaired.  
In the Mood for Love
 The story takes place in an exiled [[Shanghainese]] community of Hong Kong in 1962. Chow Mo-wan ([[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai|Tony Leung]]), a journalist, rents a room in an apartment of a building on the same day as Su Li-zhen ([[Maggie Cheung]]), a secretary from a shipping company. They become next-door neighbours. Each has a spouse who works and often leaves them alone on overtime shifts. Despite the presence of a friendly Shanghainese landlady, Mrs. Suen, and bustling, [[mahjong]]-playing neighbours, Chow and Su often find themselves alone in their rooms. Their lives continue to intersect in everyday situations: a recurring motif is the loneliness of eating alone. The film documents the leads' chance encounters, each making his and her individual trek to the street noodle stall.  Chow and Su each nurse suspicions about one's own spouse's fidelity; each comes to the conclusion that their spouses have been seeing each other. Su wonders aloud how their spouses' affair might have begun. Su and Chow re-enact what they imagine might have happened.  Chow soon invites Su to help him write a [[wuxia|martial arts]] serial for the papers. Their neighbours begin to take notice of Su's prolonged absences. In the context of a socially conservative [[1960s in Hong Kong|1960s' Hong Kong]], friendships between men and women bear scrutiny. Chow rents a hotel room away from the apartment where he and Su can work together without attracting attention. The relationship between Chow and Su is platonic, as there is the suggestion that they would be degraded if they stooped to the level of their spouses. As time passes, however, they acknowledge that they have developed feelings for each other. Chow leaves Hong Kong for a job in [[Singapore]]. He asks Su to go with him; Chow waits for her at the hotel room and then leaves. She can be seen rushing down the stairs of her apartment, only to arrive at the empty hotel room, too late to join Chow.  The next year, Su goes to Singapore and visits Chow's apartment. She calls Chow, who is working for a Singaporean newspaper, but she remains silent when Chow picks up. Later, Chow realises she has visited his apartment after seeing a lipstick-stained cigarette butt in his [[ashtray]]. While dining with a friend, Chow relays a story about how in older times, when a person had a secret that could not be shared, he would instead go atop a mountain, make a hollow in a tree, whisper the secret into that hollow and cover it with mud.  Three years later, Su visits her former landlady, Mrs. Suen. Mrs. Suen is about to emigrate to the United States, and Su inquires about whether the apartment is available for rent. Some time later, Chow returns to visit his landlords, the Koos. He finds they have emigrated to the [[Philippines]]. He asks about the Suen family next door, and the new owner tells him a woman and her son are now living next door. He leaves without realising Su is the lady living there.  The film ends at [[Siem Reap]], [[Cambodia]], where Chow is seen visiting [[Angkor Wat]]. At the site of a ruined monastery, he whispers for some time into a hollow in a ruined wall, before plugging the hollow with mud.  
In July (film)
  At the beginning of his summer holiday, a somewhat naive trainee teacher Daniel ([[Moritz Bleibtreu]]) buys a ring from a stall run by a neighbor, the aspiring artist and street vendor Juli (in German, "Juli" would be not only the month July but also a common nickname for someone named "Julia"; [[Christiane Paul]]). The ring bears a [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] [[sun]] symbol, which, according to Juli, has the power to lead him to the woman of his dreams, whom he will recognise by a similar sun symbol. As Juli has the ring's counterpart, and as she is in love with him, she invites Daniel to a party that evening, hoping that they will meet.  Curious, Daniel goes to the party and meets Melek ([[İdil Üner]]), a young Turkish woman who is wearing a [[T-shirt]] imprinted with a sun symbol. Convinced that she is the woman of his dreams, Daniel talks to her. Melek is only passing through and looking for a place to spend the night. After spending the evening together seeing the sights of [[Hamburg]], Daniel invites her to spend the night in his apartment.  Daniel and Melek leave the party just as Juli arrives. She sees them leave together. In her disappointment, she decides to leave town. Next day she goes to the [[Autobahn]] to [[hitchhike|hitch]] a ride, with no predetermined destination.  As [[destiny|fate]] would have it, Daniel is the first car to stop, on his way back from the [[Hamburg Airport|airport]], where he has just dropped Melek off. He has decided to drive to [[Istanbul]] in search of Melek, who, as she told him, will be under the bridge over the [[Bosporus]] at a certain time a few days later, although he does not know why. Daniel takes Juli with him in his stoner roommate's rusty old car. And this is the beginning a long and exciting trip across a scorching hot [[Southeastern Europe]].  
In the Light of the Moon
  As a child, Wisconsinite Ed Gein is subjected to physical and psychological abuse at the hands of his religious fanatic mother, Augusta, and his alcoholic father, George. A year after his father dies, Ed goes out hunting with his older brother, Henry, and the two get into an argument over Henry wanting to leave home and Ed's devotion to Augusta. When Henry insults their mother, Ed flies into a rage and [[buttstroke]]s him; regaining his senses as Henry collapses, Ed panics and sets a fire, which Henry's "accidental" death is blamed on.   Augusta later dies of a [[stroke]], leaving Ed alone in their desolate [[Plainfield, Wisconsin|Plainfield]] farm, which a despondent Ed allows to fall into a state of disrepair, with the exception of his mother's room, which Ed seals off. Living off of [[Agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] and the money that he makes from leasing land and babysitting neighborhood children, the increasingly unstable Ed spends his plentiful free time making nightly excursions into local cemeteries. Ed digs up the bodies of recently deceased elderly women, who he makes futile attempts at reviving before decorating parts of his home with pieces of them. The townspeople notice how perturbed Ed seems, but regard him as nothing more than a harmless eccentric with a morbid sense of humor and an obsession with graphic literature about crime, [[headhunting]] cannibal tribes, and [[Nazism]].  Ed begins suffering from hallucinations of Augusta, who he believes is contacting him from beyond the grave, commanding him to resurrect her and do the Lord's work by murdering sinful women. Ed's first victim is a local tavern owner, Mary Hogan, who he wounds with a handgun before bringing her to his home, where he leaves her bound to a bed. Days pass before Mary succumbs to her injury, at which point Ed mutilates and eats her remains, using what is left over to add to a female "flesh suit" that he has been constructing.   Ed's delusions subsequently worsen, and he becomes convinced that Mary's death has brought back Augusta. A hallucination of Augusta eventually implores Ed to murder Collette Marshall, a hardware store owner who Ed had been unsuccessfully trying to woo. Ed reluctantly shoots Collette and transports her body to his house before having dinner with the Hills, a neighboring family who he surprises with "[[Venison]] steaks." Collette's employee, Brian, returns from a hunting trip and calls the police after finding the shop full of blood.   Brian becomes convinced that Ed, whose behavior towards both Mary and Collette he had always found unnerving, is responsible for the women's disappearances. Brian rushes to Ed's home, where he unearths Collette's freshly decapitated and "[[Field dressing (hunting)|dressed out]]" body. Wanting to avenge his friends' deaths, Brian tracks Ed down to the Hill residence, but is talked out of shooting him by Sheriff Stillwell, who arrests Ed.  The film ends with a nonlinear [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] that consists of officers uncovering evidence in Ed's home, interviews with Ed after he was placed in a [[psychiatric hospital]], and scenes in which Ed tries to keep his urges in check through prayer and rituals, and others in which he exhumes corpses, only to rebury them after snapping out of a [[Fugue state]]. An [[intertitle]] then states that Ed was buried next to his mother after dying of respiratory failure in 1984.

However, when a man running from the law, Hyun-shik ([[Kim Yu-seok]]), comes to the resort, a bond starts to form between them.  At the start of the film, Hyun-shik arrives at the resort and is ferried to his float by Hee-jin.

Is It Fall Yet?
  Though Daria and Jane are still on speaking terms, Jane is cold toward Daria, and their relationship is tense. Daria and Tom are seeing each other romantically, but due to Daria's personality and the gravity of the situation, they are taking things slowly. Jane has signed up for a summer art camp, seemingly to avoid Daria. At the camp, Jane meets an older girl and the two bond over mutual contempt for their pretentious mentor and equally pretentious peers. However, one night the girl repeatedly tries to come onto Jane, disregarding Jane's protests that "she's straight". The next time they meet, Jane seems confused about her own sexuality, but her confusion turns to anger when she realizes that the girl is sleeping with their pompous instructor. This causes Jane to become disillusioned with the art world. Daria intends to do nothing but read, sleep, and see her friends, but her mother [[Helen Morgendorffer|Helen]] forces her to work as a counselor at English teacher [[Timothy O'Neill (Daria)|Timothy O'Neill]]'s summer day camp for pre-pubescent children. While at the camp, Daria meets a nihilistic young boy named Link, who feels disillusioned with his existence and voices his bad attitude every chance he gets. It is loosely implied that he is [[emotional abuse|emotionally abused]] by his mother and his stepfather. Recognizing herself in Link, Daria attempts to reach out to him. However, he rejects her overtures, which results in Daria feeling worse. Paralleling these emotions is her relationship with Tom, which she effectively ends for the discomfort it brings.  After getting a poor score on her exams, Quinn desperately wants to prove she's smarter without ruining her image in the fashion club. She gets a tutor who has a no-nonsense policy on his students so Quinn becomes more determined to study. Eventually, after her study sessions show her improvement, Quinn begins to realize that she is falling in love with her tutor. At their final study session, she confesses her feelings to him, but is hurt when the tutor says she's not his type due to her low aspirations on her academic future (the college Quinn wants to go to is considered a party school). In a heart to heart talk with Daria, Quinn shows how hurt she is, from the rejection. The talk with Quinn gives Daria a new perspective on her differences with Tom.   Daria comes to visit Jane, and, due to some meddling from Jane's brother [[Trent Lane|Trent]], the two reconcile. After returning home, Daria tells Jane that she was always impressed by Jane's strong sense of identity, which resolves Jane's identity crisis. Daria receives a letter from Link that invites her to email him, thus assuaging her fears that she is incapable of reaching out to or connecting with another human being. Jane affirms that she is no longer upset by Daria and Tom dating and encourages Daria to get back together with him.

Jason and the Argonauts (miniseries)
 The film opens as soldiers invade the city of [[Iolcus]]. King [[Aeson]]'s ([[Ciarán Hinds]]) [[brother]] [[Pelias]] ([[Dennis Hopper]]) is leading the charge. Inside the temple he goes to embrace his brother but produces a dagger and kills him during the embrace. This is witnessed by his wife Polymele ([[Diana Kent]]) and his son Jason ([[Jason London]]). He intends to do the same to Jason but one of the guards rescues him and takes him out of the palace through a secret tunnel.   It is then revealed that this is a memory, experienced as a nightmare by an older Jason, who  awakes. He is then ordered by his uncle to retrieve the [[golden fleece]].   He recruits a crew from the simple folk of [[Iolcus]], including shepherds and farmers. He is joined by [[Hercules]] ([[Brian Thompson]]), [[Orpheus]] ([[Adrian Lester]]), [[Atalanta]] ([[Olga Sosnovska]]) and the brothers [[Castor and Pollux]]. [[Acastus]] stows away on the ship. The [[Argonauts]] run aground on a strange island in the middle of the ocean that is actually the sea god [[Poseidon]]. In the ensuing storm, they lose the map. The crew make their way to the Isle of [[Lemnos]], an island of warrior women, to recover from the experience and repair the ship. The men pleasure themselves with the women while their ship is repaired (except Orpheus and Atalanta) and Jason sleeps with the queen [[Hypsipyle]]. Atalanta discovers that the women have killed all the men on the island and are planning to sacrifice the crew. She warns Jason, and the Argonauts flee the island.  The crew become rebellious and Jason has [[Zetes]], a young man with brilliant vision, see the stars and find their route to Tabletop Island, where they find [[Phineus]]. They are attacked by the [[Harpies]] - the winged monsters that torment Phineus - and kill them. In return, Phineus tells them the Golden Fleece is in [[Colchis]]. Meanwhile, on Colchis, the princess [[Medea]] has visions of the crew and her brother Aspyrtes goes out to find them. Jason finds the ship wrecked and rescues Aspyrtes. They approach the "[[Symplegades|Dark Rocks]]" and send a dove through before sailing through themselves.  The ship docks at Colchis and Jason goes ashore with Aspyrtes, Castor and Pollux. Hera asks [[Eros]] to shoot Medea so she falls in love with Jason. King Aertes wants Jason killed but Medea convinces him to face the Minoan Bull. Medea gives Jason magic oil that protects Jason from the bull's fiery-breath. Jason yokes the bull and ploughs a field and sows it with dragon's teeth. [[Spartoi|Warriors]] sprout up from the earth, and Jason tricks them into attacking each other. Medea tells Jason she must go with the Fleece. Aspyrtes overhears this and sends soldiers out after them.  The other Argonauts debate whether to leave or not. Hercules, Orpheus and [[Argus (son of Arestor)|Argos]] sail the ship around the island to make it seem as if they have left while the others hide in the water and then join Jason and Medea. When the soldiers attack, Medea kills her brother and leads them to the Fleece which is guarded by a dragon. Some Argonauts are killed before Jason sets a noose around the dragon's neck and makes it fall off a precipice. They take the Fleece and sail away from Colchis.  Acastus has been wounded and Medea uses magic to heal him. Atalanta confesses she loves Jason but he says he will marry Medea. She has a vision of her father's death and the two kiss. Zeus attempts to seduce Medea but she says she loves Jason, even when he pulls out Eros's arrow. The ship arrives back in Iolcus and Jason learns his mother killed herself, believing him and Acastus to be dead. They rest in the bay and Acastus steals the Fleece and goes into town. Pelias kills him and takes the Fleece. Medea then goes and says he will marry her. Jason and the others sneak into the palace through the secret tunnel. Argos is killed by one of the guards. Pelias tries to kill Jason but is stabbed by his own knife.  To cremate the dead [[Argus (son of Arestor)|Argos]], his corpse is burned with the [[Argo]]. Then Jason marries Medea and they live happily ever after as [[King]] and [[Queen consort|Queen]] of Iolcus.  
Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman
 Sam Tiler ([[Christopher Allport]]) has been struggling to recover from the encounter with the Mutated Snowman known as Jack Frost (much to everyone else's disbelief and amusement), ever since he rampaged through his hometown last Christmas. To get away from the stress, Sam's wife Anne (Eileen Seeley) suggests a tropical vacation in a cabana far away in the Pacific for the wedding of his deputy, Joe Foster (Chip Heller) and his secretary Marla ([[Marsha Clark]]). Sam reluctantly agrees, after reinforcement from his doctor ([[Ian Abercrombie]]).  Meanwhile, the FBI has dug up the [[antifreeze]] used to dissolve Jack (voiced by [[Scott MacDonald (actor)|Scott MacDonald]]) attempting to test it for remains of the genetic material. One of the janitors (Brett A. Boydstun) accidentally spills a cup of coffee into the tank of antifreeze, waking Jack up and causing him to reform and break free. Jack, now sharing a psychic link with Sam because of Sam’s blood mixing with Jack in the antifreeze, follows Sam.  Sam, Anne, Marla and Joe arrive to a greeting by the eccentric Colonel Hickering ([[Ray Cooney]]) and his assistants Captain Fun (Sean Patrick Murphy) and Bobby (Tai Bennett). Jack washes ashore and kills three women, Ashlea (Shonda Farr), Paisley (Granger Green), and Rose ([[Jennifer Lyons]]). The next morning, the Colonel discovers the bodies and tries to cover up the whole mess, as he does not want this to ruin his resort. However, the island's manager, Agent Manners (David Allen Brooks) who had survived [[Jack Frost (1997 film)|Jack’s maiming of him]], suspects that Jack has returned.  Jack continues his rampage, killing a beach model named Sarah (Melanie Good) and stabbing her cameraman ([[Paul H. Kim]]) to death with his carrot nose. Sam begins to suspect that something is amiss when he runs into Manners, who agrees to an alliance in order to stop Jack Frost. Sam, Captain Fun, and Manners stage a trap to capture Jack. This fails as the snowman they capture was really the Colonel in costume.  After slaying another beach model named Cindy (Stephanie Chao) by freezing the pool she is swimming in and drowning her, Jack decides that the tropics are a bit too warm and freezes the place, causing it to snow and freeze the lifeguard (Kerri V. Griffin). The party guests begin to play around in snowball fights when Jack enters the fray, killing at least another dozen. Sam, Anne, Marla, Manners and Joe lock themselves up in their room, using antifreeze to keep Jack at bay.  Sam and Manners decide to find help, and end up finding a room where the Colonel, Captain Fun, and Bobby have barricaded themselves in. Sam asks the three of them where they can find antifreeze, to which Bobby suggests they use the coolant for the generator, which uses the same material. Luring Jack into a trap, Sam once again tricks Jack into a pool of coolant. Unfortunately, this does not work, as Jack has become much more resilient to the antifreeze due to his time in the lab. Jack spits out a snowball and flees, followed by Manners, into the woods.  Sam, Anne, and the others observe the snowball and it "hatches" and becomes a baby snowman, who kills Captain Fun. They trap the snowman in a blender and try many different ways of killing it, all of which fail.  Meanwhile, Manners has followed Jack to a shed, where he sees that Jack has spit up many, many snowball children. He calls the others and tells them what he has seen, but before leaving he is attacked and devoured by the tiny snowmen.  Sam, in panic since the antifreeze does not work, is pushed to the side as Anne takes charge in order get Joe and the Colonel to go around the island to trap as many of the snowmen as they can until the supply boat (which is coming to the island to drop off more supplies) comes, while Bobby, Marla and Sam wait back in the kitchen. During the search, the snowmen kill seven more tourists. Eventually, Anne realizes that they can be killed by bananas, due to Sam being allergic to bananas. As a result, Jack would share the same vulnerabilities, since he absorbed some of Sam's genetics in Snowmonton. Everybody soon makes a big batch of banana smoothies, which they then use to kill the tiny snowmen. However, one of them crawls back to Jack, fatally wounded. Jack picks it up and observes it, and then watches it slowly die in his arms.  Jack sheds a tear, mourning the loss of his new family. He then becomes angry, stabbing the Colonel through the head with an icicle from behind and slitting Bobby's throat with another icicle. Marla and Joe flee and lock themselves in the freezer with Captain Fun's body, while Anne is attacked by Jack. Sam snaps out of his paranoia and shoots Jack with a banana attached to an arrow, causing him to explode. Anne and Sam embrace each other and walk towards the ocean, prepared to leave the island with any of the other surviving guests.  During the credits the two sailors on the supply boat are crushed by a giant carrot, implying that Jack is still alive. After the credits roll, we're shown that Joe and Marla were accidentally left in the freezer by Sam and Anne, and it's implied that the couple froze to death there.

Joint Security Area (film)
 Two [[North Korea]]n soldiers are killed in the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] at a North Korean border house, before Sergeant Lee Soo-hyeok ([[Lee Byung-hun]]), a South Korean soldier on border duties, attempts to flee back to the South Korean side. The southern troops rescue him while gunfire erupts and, two days later, the fragile relationship between the two Koreas depends on a special investigation conducted by [[Military of Switzerland|Swiss Army]] Major Sophie E. Jean ([[Lee Young-ae]]) on behalf of the [[Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission]].  As Sergeant Lee Soo-hyeok has confessed to the shootings, Sophie investigates why the two Koreas have contradicting accounts of events; Soo-hyeok's states he was knocked out and kidnapped while relieving himself and, waking tied up in the North Korean border house, secretly freed himself and shot three North Korean soldiers, leaving two dead. The North Korean survivor Sergeant Oh Kyeong-pil ([[Song Kang-ho]]) states that Soo-hyeok barged into the border house and shot everyone before retreating when the wounded Kyeong-pil returned fire.  The autopsy report shows that one soldier, Jeong Woo-jin ([[Shin Ha-kyun]]), was shot eight times repeatedly, indicating a grudge was held; additionally, a single bullet is not accounted for. Over the course of the investigation, witness Private First Class Nam Sung-shik ([[Kim Tae-woo (actor)|Kim Tae-woo]]) attempts suicide by jumping out of the window of the interrogation room and a strange emotional reaction between Kyeong-pil and Soo-hyeok during a meeting causes Sophie to confirm her suspicions that the surviving soldiers and Woo-jin held a mutual friendship and were attempting to protect one another.  Through flashbacks it is shown that Soo-hyeok had previously been on patrol with other soldiers, only to get lost on the North Korean side and to partially trip a mine; found by Kyeong-pil and Woo-jin, the two deactivate the mine, which later prompts Soo-hyeok to throw written messages over the border to maintain contact. Eventually inviting Soo-hyeok across the border, the three become a group of friends that soon includes Sung-shik, with the four agreeing to leave politics out of their friendship so to remain loyal to their own countries.  As tensions rise between the North and South, Soo-hyeok and Sung-shik return to the North to say goodbye and celebrate Woo-jin's birthday, only to be discovered by a commanding officer from the North and resulting in a [[Mexican Standoff]]. Despite Woo-jin panicking and betraying his friends, Kyeong-pil convinces Woo-jin, Soo-hyeok and the officer to lower their weapons, only for Sung-shik to panic and shoot the commanding officer when he reaches for his radio; when Woo-jin draws his gun again, Sung-shik shoots him, and in a daze, shoots his corpse several times. Earlier in their friendship when Soo-hyeok is joking around with his gun, Kyeong-pil asked Soo-hyeok if he'd ever had to kill a man like he's had to, implying that Soo-hyeok doesn't know what it's like. Kyeong-pil slaps Sung-shik out of his daze, takes the gun from him and kills the still-alive officer, then persuades Soo-hyeok and Sung-shik to flee with a false alibi of being kidnapped, before throwing away the evidence that he and Woo-jin were fraternizing with Southern soldiers. After shooting Kyeong-pil in the shoulder to complete the alibi, Soo-hyeok and Sung-shik flee across the border, with the latter getting past unseen; as Soo-hyeok's wounded leg from the firefight prevents him from running, he is the only soldier seen and picked up by soldiers.  Sophie is eventually removed from the case when it's discovered that her father, a former POW, had North Korean ties during the [[Korean War]], thus technically making her a non-neutral. Before leaving, she attempts to informally learn of the true events first with Kyeong-pil and then Soo-hyeok. Having asked Kyeong-pil if he had a message for Soo-hyeok, Sophie gives Soo-hyeok the lighter he first gave to Kyeong-pil. Before saying goodbye and wishing him well, she reveals that Kyeong-pil told her that he saw Soo-hyeok's gun actually shot Woo-jin first during the chaos before Sung-shik shot him. On his way out, Soo-hyeok steals an officer's pistol and commits suicide out of guilt for Woo-jin's death and Sung-shik's suicide attempt. The film concludes with an American tourist's photograph of the joint security area that accidentally contains all four soldiers prior to the incident.

In Egypt, Joseph is made the servant of [[Potiphar]], the captain of Pharaoh's guards, and gradually becomes his personal attendant after Joseph stops a shifty horse trader from [[Confidence trick|conning]] more money from Potiphar. Joseph befriends [[Asenath]], the beautiful daughter of Potiphar, and proves himself an asset to the captain.  However, Potiphar's wife [[Zuleikha (tradition)|Zuleika]] tries to seduce Joseph and is denied by him; so she lies to Potiphar that Joseph attempted to seduce her. Potiphar orders Joseph's death; but when his wife intervenes, he realises that Joseph is not guilty and therefore imprisons him instead. While imprisoned, Joseph interprets the [[dream]]s of the royal [[butler]] and [[baker]] who are also prisoners: that the butler will return to his position at the palace in three days, and the baker will be put to death in three days. Joseph asks the butler to tell the [[Pharaoh]] [[Rameses I]] about his talent and offer of help, to secure a release from prison. The butler promises to tell Pharaoh but forgets; while Asenath supplies food to Joseph regularly.  When the Pharaoh Rameses I is haunted by [[nightmare]]s and is told by the butler that Joseph can interpret them, he sends Potiphar to retrieve Joseph, who interprets the pharaoh's dreams as warnings of 7 years of feast, followed by 7 years of famine caused by a [[drought]], and suggests that one-fifth of each year's crops be kept for rationing. Impressed, the Pharaoh makes Joseph his minister, under the name "[[Zaphnath-Paaneah]]". In the following years, Joseph's plan and farming innovations not only save Egypt from starvation, but allows Egypt to sell excess grain to it's neighbors. Joseph marries Asenath and has two children with her, a daughter and then a son.  Eventually, his brothers arrive in [[Egypt]] to buy food, as they are running out, and do not recognize Joseph, who denies them their offers of purchase, accuses them of espionage, and has [[Simeon (son of Jacob)|Simeon]] imprisoned, and says that they will only get there brother back if they prove that they have their youngest brother Benjamin. Questioned by Asenath, he reveals his past. The next day the brothers reappear with a young man named [[Benjamin]], who is Joseph's almost identical younger brother. Simeon is released and Joseph asks Benjamin about his family; to learn that his mother, Rachel, is dead, and his own death presumed.  Joseph invites the brothers to a feast and has his own golden [[chalice]] concealed in Benjamin's bag while no one is looking; and upon its discovery, orders that Benjamin be enslaved as part of a test to see if his brothers had changed. He is astonished when his older brothers offer themselves instead, as losing another son would surely cause their elderly father to die from heartbreak. Grief-stricken and ashamed, Judah confesses having sold Joseph himself due to jealousy, and it has haunted him and his brothers ever since. Touched by their honesty and genuine love for Benjamin, Joseph identifies himself to them, reconciles and invites them and their families to live in a nearby village, and makes his brothers head of the food rationing. Shortly after, he is happily reunited with his father, and meets the wives and children of his brothers.

Ju-On: The Curse 2
 Like the first film, ''Ju-on 2'' is split into six vignettes, the first two being taken from the first. The segments are presented in the following order: Kayako (伽椰子), Kyoko (響子), Tatsuya (達也), Kamio (神尾), Nobuyuki (信之), and Saori (沙織).  Shunsuke Kobayashi, a teacher, visits the Saeki household but finds the young [[Toshio Saeki]] alone at home. However, he quickly finds the corpse of [[Kayako Saeki]] hidden in the attic and receives a phone call from her husband [[Takeo Saeki]] who reveals he has killed Kobayashi's pregnant wife Manami and butchered her unborn child, due to believing Kayako was being unfaithful upon discovering she has an obsessive crush on Kobayashi. Kayako's body rises as an [[Onryō]] and kills Kobayashi, before tracking down and killing the rampaging Takeo.  Sometime later, a woman named Kyoko helps her brother Tatsuya, a real estate agent, to examine the Saeki house and put it on the market. However, Kyoko is disturbed by the house and leaves, visiting her nephew Nobuyuki in the apartment once owned by Kobayashi. They witness a vision of Takeo murdering Manami and are affected by the Saeki curse. Tatsuya moves them to his parents' house in the countryside, where Kyoko is seemingly possessed and rocks back and forth, whilst Nobuyuki has become a mute. Tatsuya's father believes the Saeki house's curse is responsible, so Tatsuya heads off to investigate.  The current residents of the Saeki house, Yoshimi and Hiroshi Kitada, become affected by the curse. Yoshimi murders her husband by walloping him with a [[frying pan]], and then kills Tatsuya when he visits. All of Tatsuya's family save Nobuyuki die from the curse. Around a month later, Nobuyuki is still a mute and is observed by police officers Kamio and Iizuka. Both visit another officer, Yoshikawa, who has been driven insane by his attempted investigation of the deaths surrounding the Saeki house, but he and his wife are killed by Kayako. Kamio is later attacked by Kayako at work, shocking Iizuka and another female officer who go to check his office. Kamio is killed shortly afterwards by Kayako.  In the penultimate vignette, Nobuyuki is shown at school. He spots Kayako outside the window, and she suddenly opens and crawls in through it. Nobuyuki flees whilst pursued by the surprisingly agile Kayako. A second Kayako appears, while he makes an attempt to escape through the stairs. Both ghosts corner Nobuyuki in a science lab and kill him - the final shots of the vignette showing there is an army of Kayako replicas outside, scratching the windows, and still making their ominous death rattle, reflecting on the curse's never-ending, spreading effects.  The film closes with a brief final segment consisting of a close-up of the Nerima house from outside, with voice-overs indicating a group of high school girls, one of whom is named Saori, sneaking into the house. They are exploring the second floor and the film ends right after they notice something in the attic. The segment serves as a teaser for the 2003 theatrical film, ''[[Ju-on: The Grudge]]''; it is likely a prelude to the "Izumi" segment of that film, as Saori is the name of one of Izumi's friends who went missing in the house.  
Ju-On: The Curse
 The film is told in [[nonlinear narrative|non-chronological order]] through six segments, each titled after a character central to each segment. They are, in order: Toshio (俊雄), Yuki (由紀), Mizuho (瑞穂), Kanna (柑菜), Kayako (伽椰子), and Kyoko (響子).  Illustrator [[Takeo Saeki]] murdered his wife, [[Kayako Saeki|Kayako]], after discovering from her journal that she had held a deep crush with her college friend, Shunsuke Kobayashi. He also killed his son, [[Toshio Saeki]], and the family cat, Mar, before deserting his house. The anger and sorrow surrounding the murder created a curse that turned its inhabitants into [[Onryō]]. Whoever enters the house in [[Nerima]], [[Tokyo]], or even those associating themselves with someone who has entered the house will be affected and claimed by the curse, spreading its influence at the place they die and claiming more victims. Kobayashi, who happens to be Toshio's elementary school teacher, visits the Saeki house concerning Toshio's repeated absence from school, leaving his pregnant wife, Manami, in their apartment. He only finds Toshio, who refuses to speak with him, forcing him to wait for Toshio's parents to come home. Kobayashi grows weary of the strangeness that surrounds the house, and after accidentally stumbling upon Kayako's room, he learns of her unrequited love for him as well as her bloody corpse, hidden in the attic. Panicking, Kobayashi tries to escape with Toshio until he receives a call from Takeo, who has gone to his apartment and forcefully aborted Manami's unborn fetus, killing her. In shock, he is unable to act properly as Kayako's corpse suddenly moves and kills him. Meanwhile, Takeo walks limply while carrying the dead fetus and is killed in the street by Kayako who resurfaces from a dumpster nearby.  An unknown amount of time later, the Saeki house is occupied by the Murakami family. Daughter Kanna is taught by her tutor, Yuki, until she remembers that [[Katasumi and 4444444444|she has to go to school to feed the school rabbits]]. Yuki, who has a [[Ailurophobia|phobia of cats]], backs up towards Kanna's closet when a black cat suddenly appears in the house. Hearing strange sounds from the attic, she goes to investigate and is pulled by Kayako. Kanna's brother, Tsuyoshi, however, is unaware of the incident and goes to school to meet his girlfriend, Mizuho Tamura. [[Katasumi and 4444444444|Tsuyoshi never makes it to the school]] and Mizuho is forced to wait in the teacher's room while a teacher inspects the school once more. There, she is spooked by Toshio until she receives a call from "4444444444" (the Japanese word for 4 (四, ''shi'') is pronounced similarly to the word for "death" (死, ''shi'')), at which point Toshio appears directly beside her. Meanwhile, detective Yoshikawa and his aide, Kamio, investigates a mutilated body of a high school girl, Hisayo Yoshida, who is one of the two students scheduled to feed the school rabbits, and an unrelated human jaw nearby. Back at the Murakami house, mother Noriko has just returned home from shopping when she notices a seemingly beaten up Kanna entering her house. She screams when her daughter moves to face her, showing her without her jaw.  The Nerima house is taken over by the Suzuki Real Estate, owned by Tatsuya Suzuki, for sale. Tatsuya contacts his spiritually-aware sister, Kyoko, to visit the house. She immediately feels discomfort upon entering the house, sensing Kayako's presence. After taking a gulp of [[sake]], Kyoko tells Tatsuya that anyone who want to purchase the house have to drink the sake; if they spit it out, they should not buy it. She immediately makes a hasty escape from the house, leaving her brother behind. Sometime later, Kyoko is informed that the house has been sold to the Kitada couple. She visits the house once more and is shocked upon seeing the wife, Yoshimi Kitada, realizing that she has been possessed by Kayako.

His parents being long dead, he lives with his married sister Neelu and has bonded closely with her husband, Vinod.  Prem is in love with Nisha and even the wedding date has been fixed. However, fate has something else in store for him. On the wedding day, even as Prem waits at the altar, his bride fails to show up. It emerges that Nisha is now betrothed to marry a rich and successful [[Non-resident Indian|NRI]] who lives in the USA. Prem is heartbroken and takes to drink; as a result, his career suffers. His support and mainstay is his brother-in-law, who understands his situation and empathizes with him.  Priya moves to the neighbourhood to stay with her cousin Mona, an aspiring actress. Priya wants to make a career for herself as a videographer, but her widowed mother (who lives in Pune) wants to see her married and settled into a family. She has only very reluctantly permitted Priya to move to Mumbai for a brief period. Mona, who is  friends with Prem's sister, suggests that Priya be accepted into Prem's troupe to do videography work for weddings and events. This happens, and slowly, and as they work together, Prem starts getting attracted to Priya. However, he does not express his feelings. Priya is also vaguely attracted to Prem but his whole profile is of a man still deeply in love with his former fiancée, and she has no way of knowing that he has any feelings for her.  Meanwhile, Priya's mother has been busy searching for an alliance, and finally her prayers seem to have been answered: a well-settled guy from a decent, US-based family has been identified. After some meetings between the two families, the marriage is arranged in the usual Indian manner and Priya is betrothed to Rahul. It turns out that Rahul is none other than the rich guy who Nisha was supposed to marry. Why did she not marry him eventually? It is revealed that Nisha had dumped Prem very unwillingly, and only because she needed money to arrange medical care for her kid brother, who suffers from cancer. The only way to raise funds, as Nisha saw it, was by marrying a wealthy man. When Rahul discovers this, he chooses to pay for the boy's treatment without any strings attached, and refuses to marry a girl who was in love with someone else. The boy undergoes his cancer surgery and becomes completely cured. Nevertheless, by this time, Rahul and Priya are engaged to marry each other (as arranged by their parents) and therefore, after the surgery, Nisha thinks of returning to Prem.  Nisha reaches Prem's house at a time when Priya is there and the latter surmises, correctly, that Nisha wants to get back with Prem. She also assumes that Prem is willing to accept Nisha back, because he is now aware of the motivation behind Nisha's previous betrayal. Priya is strangely distraught. She runs immediately to Rahul and demands that he should marry her the very next day, instead of several months later (as planned by the parents). Meanwhile, Prem is telling Nisha that things can never be the same between them again; he is a changed man, and he is secretly in love with Priya. It is his sad fate that Priya also is about to marry Rahul; perhaps happiness is not in his destiny; but in all events, he feels that he cannot marry Nisha. He bids her good luck and goodbye.  The very next day, Nisha has a business appointment in Agra and catches a flight to that city. On the plane, she bumps into Rahul and Priya. They tell her that they are going to the Taj Mahal for the wedding. Nisha wishes them all the best, and in turn, Priya congratulates Nisha on getting reconciled with Prem, and wishes them all the best also. Nisha immediately tells Priya that in fact, Prem has rebuffed her and told her that he is in love with someone else. Priya is amazed and elated. Who on earth is Prem in love with? Nisha says that she does not know; but Priya knows in her heart of hearts that she is the girl who Prem secretly loves.  By an amazing coincidence, Prem and his family (sister and brother-in-law) are also aboard the same flight, trying to stop Priya and Rahul's marriage. Prem sings a meaningful love-song, which Priya realizes is for her. By the time the flight lands in Agra, Prem and Priya are united with each other while Rahul and Nisha also get together with each other.

Karuvelam Pookkal
 It is a [[graphic]] picture of the abject misery of the rural poor. Its hard hitting message screams at you from the screen, loud and clear. Hitherto, there seemed to be only a couple of angles to [[Child labour in India]], viz., children losing out on their carefree childhood and basic formal education. But there are so many other unthought of issues too, says scriptwriter and director [[Poomani]], through the film Karuvelam Pookkal, jointly produced by [[National Film Development Corporation of India|NFDC]] and [[Doordarshan]].  Karisalkulam, a small village, is inhabited mainly by Farmers. When the arid land offers them nothing but penury, enter the match factory owners from nearby villages. They lure the credulous, illiterate villagers into sending their daughters to work at the factories from dawn to much after dusk. The initial euphoria of a steady income givesway to despair, as is clearly brought out through the story of Nallamuthu ([[Nassar|Nasser]]), his wife Vadivu ([[Raadhika|Radhika]]) and their three children. Mariyappan ([[Charle]]) is the [[Match]] factory agent in charge of finding child labourers for the factory. While the children slog in the factories the men of the household become lazy appendages who spend their time getting drunk. Nasser, as the cynical father, who does not wish to get his daughter married because he does not want to forgo the income, has rendered a splendid performance in Karuvelam Pookal. Mention must be made of the scenes in which he cries aloud at his tragedies and when his impotent anger is turned towards the agents of the match factories. Radhika's is another sterling portrayal. In the role of a responsible mother caught between her husband's apathy and avarice and her children's untold suffering, she indeed lives the character. Sonia is the eldest daughter, Dhanalakshmi. Caught in the quagmire of drudgery and in the strangulating web of poverty, she seeks a way out, but sadly the respite is too short lived. A convincing essay by the young Actress. The visuals of the opening sequences transport you to the days of [[P. Bharathiraja|Bharatiraja]]'s movie [[16 Vayadhinilae]]. The beautifully captured rustic ambience is another creditable show by [[Thangar Bachan]] who has wielded the camera. The dialect, the innocent humour, the openness and the gullibility – Poomani presents them all with absolute vividness. The factories need only young girls and the boys therefore escape the hardship. After stressing on this point throughout, it is strange to see the boy accompany his sister to work, in the end. The fragrance of Karuvelam Pookkal is bound to last in the minds of the discerning audience. A film that makes you think.<ref></ref>

Keeping the Faith
  The film begins with a drunken and downtrodden Catholic priest telling his story to a sympathetic bartender ([[Brian George]]). Father Brian Finn ([[Edward Norton]]) has been dedicated to his calling since he was a child and now shares the duties of a New York parish with an older priest, Fr. Havel ([[Miloš Forman]]). Rabbi Jacob "Jake" Schram ([[Ben Stiller]]), best friends with Brian since childhood, is the youngest rabbi at his synagogue; his lack of effort to find a Jewish wife often results in his mother, Ruth ([[Anne Bancroft]]) and other women of his congregation setting him up on blind dates, much to his dismay. The two men show a close bond, even in their professions, where the two are planning the opening of a jointly sponsored community center. In its earlier days, the friendship included a third party. Via flashbacks and reminiscent musings, Anna Reilly ([[Jenna Elfman]]) is introduced: she met Jake and Brian in middle school, after beating up a bully who was picking on them. The three became great friends, and enjoyed their childhood together. Unfortunately, Anna's father got a new job that resulted in the Reillys moving to California, and ultimately she lost touch with Brian and Jake.  Sixteen years later, Anna calls her old friends out of the blue and the friendship is rekindled when her company temporarily reassigns her to a New York position. Feelings quickly begin to run deeper than before, as Anna, despite her workaholic tendencies, is as vibrant as Brian and Jake remembered her; however, it is the men's careers that are the most problematic. She and Jake begin sleeping together, but he is reluctant to be involved in a serious relationship with her because she is not Jewish, a fact which could compromise his relationship with his congregation and also with his mother (who disowned her eldest son - Jake's older brother Ethan - for marrying outside the faith). Between the religious conflict and their desire to spare the feelings of their mutual friend, the relationship is kept mostly secret, resulting in both humorous and harmful complications. As the months pass, both Jake and Anna's feelings for each other become stronger but due to the aforementioned issues, Jake still refuses the relationship as a serious one, despite Anna dropping hints to him about her having been recently taking a class (but refusing to tell him what kind of class it is), and her becoming visibly upset when they run into members of Jake's congregation while on a date and Jake introducing her only as "my old friend Anna".  Meanwhile, Brian is involved in his own test of faith as he struggles with his feelings for Anna despite his vows. Apart from praying about the situation and discussing it with Fr. Havel, he keeps these thoughts mostly to himself. Brian begins misinterpreting Anna's words and actions (some of which are subtle signals to Jake as their affair is kept under wraps) and even has an erotic dream about her; he begins to seriously consider quitting the priesthood to pursue a romantic relationship with her. Anna tells Jake that she wants things to be more serious between them and he does not respond well. While the three have dinner one night with Jake's mother Ruth, Ruth has a private conversation with Anna, where she tearfully reveals that she knows about Anna and Jake's secret relationship. Jake and Brian walk in on the ladies having a tearful moment, and later Jake and Anna have an argument over the religious issues complicating their romance, which ends in the two parting ways in frustration. Anna calls Brian for comfort and he rushes over to her apartment. Still unaware of what's been going on, he takes her tearful ramblings to be a confession of feelings for ''him'', then kisses her and admits his love. When she interrupts him, he first assumes it to be guilt based on his vows, but she tells him she is in love with Jake and finally admits that she and Jake have been seeing each other secretly for months. Feeling embarrassed and rejected, Brian raids Anna's liquor cabinet, angrily cutting off her attempts to re-assure him and apologize. He leaves and spends the whole night out drinking on the streets. The next day, still drunk, Brian stumbles into Jake's temple and interrupts a post-[[bar mitzvah]] gathering, resulting in a confrontation with Jake that ends with the priest punching the rabbi. He leaves and stumbles around the city, which brings the movie back to the very first scene with the bartender.  As the Community Center's grand opening approaches, along with the last days of Anna's East Coast assignment, the relationships begin to mend, first with Jake reconciling with Brian, followed by Anna reconciling with Brian shortly after. A discussion between the two men prompts Jake to go to Anna's office building, with Brian shouting encouragement at him as he runs down the street. Jake interrupts Anna's going away office party and manages to get her attention from a window in the building across the street and calls to explain himself and offer to set things right. Later that evening, they surprise Brian in the middle of his karaoke number at the interfaith center, which looks to be off to a successful start. Anna greets Rabbi Lewis ([[Eli Wallach]]) as he passes by and asks about their meetings together, referencing the class that Anna had told Jake briefly she had been taking, at which point it becomes clear that she had been taking classes to [[Conversion to Judaism|convert]] to Judaism. She tells him she hopes to pick it up again as she is also now staying in New York, with Jake clearly thrilled. The film ends happily with the three childhood friends posing for a photo together.  
Kevin & Perry Go Large
 The film begins at the beheading of [[Anne Boleyn]], which turns out to be an erotic daydream, introducing protagonist [[Kevin the Teenager|Kevin]], who is having sexual fantasies when he's supposed to be doing his homework about Boleyn.  Kevin has tried to lose his [[virginity]] for three years. He and his best friend, Perry go to a newsagent's to buy a [[pornography|pornographic]] magazine, which results in failure, as do all of Kevin's attempts at sexual exploration.  The boys come up with the idea to go to [[Ibiza]] to become [[DJ]]s and get "guaranteed [[Sexual intercourse|sex]]", but Kevin's parents Ray and Sheila ([[James Fleet]] and [[Louisa Rix]]) forbid the trip due to Kevin's bad grades on his school report. As a compromise however, they tell the boys they can make the trip on the condition that they get a job to pay for it.  The boys search fruitlessly for a job, ending up at a house party where Kevin again tries to succeed in finally having sex, and again fails.  Having failed miserably at all his attempts at success with women and gainful employment, Kevin is asked to sign for the delivery of his dad's credit card. Kevin then takes the card to the bank to steal the money for the flights from his dad's bank account. At the bank, Kevin accidentally foils a bank robbery, and the manager awards Kevin and Perry with enough cash to make the trip. With that, they plan for their holiday in Ibiza.  Once in Ibiza, the boys spot the 'girls of their dreams' Candice ([[Laura Fraser]]) and Gemma ([[Tabitha Wady]]). They also meet Eye Ball Paul (whose nickname derives from his practice of [[vodka eyeballing]]). The boys spend the day with the girls and although they are unsuccessful at having sex with them, they do begin to bond with them as friends.  That night, the boys walk down the high street filming the events around themselves. Kevin then films a couple snogging which turns out to be Ray and Sheila. Kevin sulks while he and Perry hang out with Ray and Sheila, finally ending up at the club "Amnesia" where they dance the night away. Their new friends, Candice and Gemma are refused entry by the doorman ([[Paul Whitehouse]]), citing their appearance as a reason.  The next day, the boys go to Paul's where he makes them clean his house in return for his listening to their tapes. Leaving Paul's house, they spot Candice and Gemma, but again their clumsy attempts at wooing them end up in failure.  After the girls have a makeover, they are admitted to Amnesia with Kevin and Perry. However, events again conspire to ruin their chance at romance with the girls. Later, Perry videotapes Ray having sex with Sheila. The following day, Paul listens to their music as the boys clean his kitchen. He stumbles across the taping of Ray and Sheila and shows it to everyone, resulting in Kevin ending his friendship with Perry after realizing he was responsible for filming them.  After a day of Kevin and he sulking around unhappily, Perry runs into Paul, who tells him that he likes their song, and that he will play it in the club. Perry tells Kevin the good news and the friends reconcile. That night they and the girls go to the club again. Their song is played but Ray and Sheila (who wanted to visit the club) are humiliated as the sex tape was used by Paul in the creation of the song. Nevertheless, the song becomes an instant club favourite. Paul becomes unhappy at Kevin and Perry's success, and turns off the song and makes the crowd angry. Kevin and Perry then take over as DJs with the club dancing through the night. The next day, Kevin and Perry finally lose their virginity to Candice and Gemma on a beach with other couples engaged in intercourse.  In the Epilogue, the boys are seen signing copies of their record in a music shop, whilst Kevin's parents are seen signing copies of a video they have made about better mid-marriage sex.

Michael tells Jada that he did it all for her. Jada, who desperately wants to stop Michael/Killjoy from killing, stabs Michael to death, and Michael fades away.  Jamal, Jada, and Monique are about to leave when Killjoy, Lorenzo, T-Bone, and Baby Boy appear behind them. Jada then remembers from the Homeless man that they have to kill the doll. The trio frantically run back into the ice-cream truck, where they end up in Michael's house, where the doll lies on the floor. The doll turns into Michael, who constantly begs her for forgiveness, but Jada continues to stab it.

Ray says that he gained access into the club free because his brother owns the place, and his name is......Killjoy! The trio then see that Ray turns into Killjoy, and Tamara turns into Lorenzo. Killjoy starts laughing maniacally at the trio, with Jada screaming "NO!", until Jada wakes up in bed, along with Jamal, indicating that the entire experience was all a dream. Jamal tries to calm Jada down by going under the covers to perform oral sex on her, but then rises from the covers as Killjoy.

Km. 0
 Pedro arranges to meet Silvia at Kilometre Zero to stay with her in Madrid, but ends up mistaking Tatiana for her. Tatiana was there to meet new client Sergio, who ends up meeting Maximo instead. Maximo was there to meet Bruno, whom he'd met [[cruising for sex|cruising]] on the internet. Bruno ends up meeting Benjamin, who's had to leave his apartment so that Miguel can meet his client, Marga. Silvia sees Gerard in his car and throws herself in front of it to catch his attention. Meanwhile, Amor walks Mario to work at the bar and goes shopping for a watch for him and for a fitting of her wedding dress.  Tatiana takes Pedro to her apartment, which is filthy. She gives him a [[oral sex|blow job]] and, when she realizes he's not her client, breaks down crying. Struck by her emotion, he begins framing her as if through a camera's viewfinder. To calm herself, Tatiana takes a sleeping pill, and when she awakens, Pedro is cleaning her apartment. He persuades her to believe in her own worth, buying her a new outfit (which she compares to ''[[Pretty Woman]]'') and convincing her that she can charge 50,000 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] instead of 5,000 as she had been.  Miguel takes Marga to his apartment for their appointment. Afterwards, she sees a wallet and finds a photograph inside. She has the same photo in her wallet; it's the only picture she has of herself and her son, whom she'd abandoned some 25 years before. Horrified, she leaves and ends up at Mario's bar.  Benjamin takes Bruno back to the apartment as well. After they spend some time together, Bruno realizes that Benjamin has lied about being his computer date. He plans to leave, but they each confess that they've fallen in love with each other. Benjamin runs to the bar to buy a bottle of champagne. There, Marga sees that it's Benjamin's wallet that she'd seen earlier and that Benjamin, not Miguel, is her son.  Gerard takes Silvia into the bar to tend to her "injuries" and she works to convince him to cast her in his new musical. She alternately recites from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and threatens to make trouble for him because of the "accident." Gerard mocks her for reciting [[Shakespeare]] to audition for a musical and threatens her back, physically. As he begins to stalk out, Silvia sings ''Maybe This Time'' from ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]''. Gerard finds her performance revelatory.  Maximo and Sergio also end up at the bar, where Maximo teases and flirts outrageously with the sexually repressed Sergio, including fondling his leg under the table. Sergio ends up in the restroom with an [[erection]] and, after Maximo gives him a neckrub, he has a spontaneous [[orgasm]]. Maximo reassures Sergio that it doesn't mean he's gay, just horny.  Amor gets robbed three times in the same day, including being dragged in the street when a man in a car snatches her purse. She reports the crimes to "Policia" (the character is not otherwise named), and as she gets up to leave, he sees that her skirt is badly torn. As he fixes it with a stapler, she notices his watch. He explains that it was a gift from his only girlfriend, who he'd met when he was twelve and whose name he never learned. Amor tells him that her name was "Amor," that she was that girl. The two have been in love ever since without knowing who the other is. They end up at the bar, where "Policia" tells Mario that he and Amor are going to marry.  The newly sophisticated-looking Tatiana enters the bar, but her nerve fails her. As she dashes out, Pedro catches her and again builds her confidence. They re-enter the bar and Maximo, calling himself Sergio's "guardian angel," arranges for Sergio to go with Tatiana. Tatiana confides in Pedro that she only asked for 40,000 pesetas instead of 50,000 and says she needs more lessons from him. They agree to live together for the three months he'll be in Madrid. Tatiana and Sergio prepare to leave; Sergio wants to say goodbye to Maximo, but Maximo has vanished. He appears sitting on a roof ledge overlooking Benjamin and Bruno as Bruno dances for Benjamin, suggesting that Maximo is their "guardian angel" as well. Miguel finds Marga at the bar and, relieved that she hasn't committed [[incest]], Marga arranges to spend a week or longer with him. Marga also gives Mario the 2,000,000 pesetas that he needs to open his photo store. Mario discovers the birthday present, a watch, that Roma slipped into his pocket several hours earlier. He kisses her, somewhat hesitantly, and she tells him that she'll wait for him.

After conversing about her missing family, Chloe drives Buck to the airport and goes to look for her younger brother.  Buck takes a plane to New York with pilot Ken Ritz. Rayford finds Chloe in an elementary school. He suggests they search the church because that is where his wife and son were most happy. Chloe refuses to go to church, saying that her mother was happiest when Ray was home. After Chloe returns home, Rayford goes to New Hope Village Church and finds Pastor [[Bruce Barnes (Left Behind)|Bruce Barnes]] ([[Clarence Gilyard]]). Bruce has also been left behind because he never truly believed in God. A believer at last, he begs for forgiveness and asks God for a second chance to help people. Rayford enters the church and kneels next to Bruce, telling him that God already has used him. They then watch a videotape left by another Reverend Billings dealing with the Rapture, in which all true believers are taken to Heaven, while the rest are left behind to endure the Tribulation&mdash;seven years of war and suffering.  When Buck gets to New York City, he finds that his friend Dirk Burton has been killed. While he is there, he takes a computer disc and is almost shot by a sniper. Buck decodes the computer disc and finds out that someone is trying to bankrupt the UN in order to control the world's food supply. Rayford confronts Hattie, telling her that their "affair" was wrong, and that he wants her forgiveness, and she leaves in a huff. Rayford tells Chloe about God and she says she believes. Meanwhile, Buck flies back to Chicago to meet with an old friend, [[CIA]] agent Alan Thompkins. After the meeting, Alan is killed in a car bombing, which Buck narrowly escapes. He goes to Rayford's house, because they are the only ones Buck knows in Chicago. Taking the wounded Buck to New Hope Church (as a makeshift hospital), Rayford and Bruce show Buck the tape that Reverend Billings made. Buck, however, does not fully believe the claims, and he goes to warn Chaim about the plot against the UN. Rayford and Chloe attempt to stop him, because he doesn't have God on his side. Buck ignores the Steeles' advice and goes to the UN anyway.  At the UN, Buck sees the plans for the new Israeli temple, and realizes that everything Rayford, Chloe and Bruce told him was true. Before the meeting, Buck finally accepts God and asks Him to show him The Way. God shows him that UN Secretary-General [[Nicolae Carpathia]] ([[Gordon Currie]]) is the [[Antichrist]] when he reveals his plan for world domination, of which his plan to rebuild the temple of Israel is a logical first step. Carpathia shoots Jonathan Stonagal and Joshua Todd-Cothran, who were behind the plot to bankrupt the UN, and then brainwashes the new "kings and queens" (the 10 UN delegates) into thinking that Stonagal shot Cothran and himself. Everyone, even the press, believes Carpathia, except Buck, who leaves and returns to the church, where he resolves to fight Carpathia with the help of his friends. Narrating, Buck says the "seven years of peace" declared by Nicolae will be the seven worst years mankind has ever seen, and that faith is all they need.

The Legend of Bagger Vance
 As an old man having his sixth heart attack while playing golf, Hardy Greaves ([[Jack Lemmon]]) contemplates how his wife used to ask him (before her passing) why he insisted on playing "a game that seems destined to kill<ref></ref>" him. Explaining his love for the game, he begins the story of his childhood idol: Rannulph Junuh ([[Matt Damon]]).  Junuh is the favorite son of [[Savannah, Georgia]]: a noteworthy golfer from a wealthy family, he and his beautiful girlfriend named Adele Invergordon ([[Charlize Theron]]) seem to have it all. While serving as a captain in the US Army during [[World War I]], Junuh is traumatized when his entire company is wiped out in battle. Though he earns the [[Medal of Honor]], he disappears after the war, returning to Georgia years later as a broken-down [[alcoholic]].  At the start of the [[Great Depression]] (circa 1930<ref>Jones actually retired from golf in 1930, but a theater playing [[The Public Enemy|''The Public Enemy'' (1931)]] is seen.</ref>), Adele is trying to recover her family's lost fortune by holding a four-round, two-day [[exhibition match]] between  [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] ([[Joel Gretsch]]) and [[Walter Hagen]] ([[Bruce McGill]]), the best golfers of the era, with a grand prize of $10,000, at a golf resort her father opened as the Depression struck. However, she needs a local participant to generate local interest. The young Greaves ([[imdbname:0597670|J. Michael Moncrief]]) speaks up for his hero, Junuh, prompting Adele to ask her estranged lover to play.  Junuh is approached by a mysterious traveler carrying a suitcase, who appears while Junuh is trying to hit golf balls into the dark void of night. The man identifies himself as Bagger Vance ([[Will Smith]]) and says he will be Junuh's [[caddie]]. With Greaves as assistant caddie, Bagger helps Junuh come to grips with his personal demons and play golf again.  When the match starts, Jones and Hagen each play well in their distinctive ways, but the disengaged Junuh plays poorly and is far behind after the first round. With Bagger caddying for him and giving advice, Junuh rediscovers his "authentic swing" in the second round and makes up some ground. In the third round, he closes the gap even more, hitting a hole in one in the process. Meanwhile, Junuh and Adele rekindle their romance.  Late in the final round, Junuh disregards Bagger's advice at a crucial point and after that plays poorly. He hits a ball into a forest, where he has a traumatic World War I flashback, but Bagger's words help him to focus on the game. Junuh pulls back to a tie with Jones and Hagen, then has a chance to win on the final hole, but has the integrity to call a penalty on himself when his ball moves after he tries to remove a loose impediment.  Seeing Junuh has grown and matured, Bagger decides his golfer doesn't need him any more. With the 18th hole left unfinished, Bagger gives the position of caddie to Greaves, and leaves Junuh as mysteriously as he came.  Though losing a chance to win because of the penalty, Junuh sinks an improbable putt and the match ends in a gentlemanly three-way tie. The three golfers shake hands with all of Savannah cheering. Junuh and Adele get back together.  The old Greaves wakes up and sees an unaged Bagger Vance beckoning him from a distance. Hardy follows, presumably to the afterlife.

The Legend of Rita
 In a letter left for her friend Tatjana, fugitive Red Army Faction terrorist Rita Vogt ([[Bibiana Beglau]]) relates the story of her life.  During the 1970s, Rita and her fellow urban guerrillas carried out armed robberies, kidnappings, and various other attacks in  West Germany, as part of their campaign of armed struggle [[anti-capitalism|against the capitalist system]]. During a visit to Paris, Rita is asked by a local police officer for her license. In response, she flees, the French police officer pursues her into a parking ramp, and Rita fatally shoots him.  Later, following a prison break which involves the murder of a [[West Berlin]] corrections officer, Rita and her comrades flee via the [[Berlin Friedrichstraße railway station|Friedrichstraße train station]] into [[East Berlin]]. As the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) has signed conventions against terrorism, the East German secret police, or Stasi, is reluctant to help. The Stasi's chief, [[Erich Mielke]] ([[Dietrich Körner]]), disagrees. In a conversation with Stasi officer Erwin Hull ([[Martin Wuttke]]), Mielke expresses sympathy for the RAF's terrorist attacks against West German and U.S. targets, which he compares to his own similar activities during both the [[Weimar Republic]] and the Nazis. He orders Agent Hull to assist them unofficially.  Hull arranges a [[safe house]] for the fugitives and secretly trains them in the use of military hardware. As Rita watches her comrades training in the use of [[Rocket-propelled grenade]]s, she is visibly horrified.  That evening, Hull boasts that the RAF has "to break laws; we can make them". He explains that those who wish to retire from armed struggle will be given new identities so that they can start a new life in the GDR. The group's two women, Friederike Adebach ([[Jenny Schilli]]) and Rita, accept the offer, much to the shock and horror of the men.  Hull then prepares Rita for her new identity and coaches her on a fictitious "legend", or backstory, that becomes her new "truth". Once the "legend" is constructed and memorized, Rita is given a menial job at a ''[[Volkseigener Betrieb]]'' clothing factory. Explaining that she is a West German, who voluntarily emigrated across the [[Berlin Wall]], Rita shocks her co-workers, who have never heard of such a thing.  To their further shock, Rita takes "solidarity" cash collections for the [[Sandinistas]] at face value and willingly donates large amounts of money. Disgusted, Rita's coworkers explain that the donations actually go to the East German government's coffers and that the claims about helping [[Nicaragua]] are just a [[confidence scam]]. Rita's patronizing response sickens her coworkers, who ostracize her.  Only her [[clinical depression|depressed]] and [[alcoholic]] co-worker Tatjana  ([[Nadja Uhl]]) develops a friendship with her. They bond deeply, Rita helps Tatjana toward sobriety, and even begins a [[lesbian]] relationship with her. Then a television announcement about the RAF from [[West Germany]] stops Rita short during a birthday party. Not only has her former lover been killed during an RPG attack against a [[NATO]] base, but the West German media continues to broadcast her as a hunted fugitive. The next morning, a co-worker tells Rita that she recognizes her from the broadcast and vows to expose who she is. In response, the Stasi promptly relocates her, allowing her only a brief, painful goodbye to Tatjana.  Her next residence and workplace, "Legend Number 2", is a children's day care center. While on vacation on the [[Baltic Sea]], she gets to know and falls in love with a student, Jochen Pettka ([[Alexander Beyer]]). Despite her cautiousness, it becomes ever more difficult for her to hide her past. After she becomes pregnant, Jochen asks her to marry him and to travel with him to an event in the [[Soviet Union]]. Agent Hull, however, tells her that this is impossible, as it will cause the Stasi's ties to the RAF to leak out. Explaining that the increasing unrest may soon topple the GDR, Hull urges Rita to have an [[abortion]]—implying that her child will be better off.  During a choral performance, Rita notices Friederike Adebach among the choir's participants. Now married with a child, Friederike is suffering under the Communist system, and bears it with grudging resentment — the same emotion seen on the faces of other GDR residents throughout the film. Rita and Friederike's reunion is sullen and they part unceremoniously.  Soon after, Rita reveals her past to Jochen. Deeply sickened, he breaks his ties to her.  In 1989/90 [[Peaceful Revolution|the GDR collapses]]. As Western consumer goods flood in, Rita is visibly disgusted and horrified. Ignoring her coworker's contempt for her opinion, Rita lectures them about how they "will never have it this good again."  Soon after, the Stasi is disbanded and its weapons are confiscated. Agent Hull informs Rita that he can no longer protect her. The news of her presence has gotten out and the GDR's ''[[Volkspolizei]]'', or ''Vopos'', will soon be coming to arrest her. In response, Rita expresses outrage that capitalism "has no borders". After watching news footage of Friederike's arrest and [[extradition]] to West Germany, Rita goes on the run.  Meanwhile, after years of imprisonment by Agent Hull merely for knowing about Rita's presence in the GDR, Tatjana is finally released and joyously runs to Rita's flat. Upon her arrival, she is grabbed by a group of plainclothes Vopos, who ask, "Are you Rita Vogt?"  Attempting to flee to the [[People's Republic of Poland]] by motorbike, Rita is asked to show her ID at a Vopo checkpoint. In a deeply ironic moment, Rita accelerates, clearly expecting the East German policemen to chase after her like their predecessor in Paris. Instead, a Vopo raises an [[AK-47]] and riddles Rita with bullets. As she falls dead from the motorbike, Rita's voice is heard in voiceover: "THAT'S EXACTLY HOW IT WAS. MORE OR LESS."  
Leprechaun in the Hood
 In [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], Mack Daddy O’Nasses ([[Ice-T]]) and Slug (Barima McKnight) discover a room full of gold, along with a [[leprechaun]] ([[Warwick Davis]]) that has been kept as a statue by a medallion on its neck. Mack Daddy takes a gold flute, but Slug accidentally frees the leprechaun and is killed, though Mack Daddy traps it once more. 20 years later, wannabe rap artists Postmaster P. ([[Anthony Montgomery]]), Stray Bullet ([[Rashaan Nall]]) and Butch (Red Grant) have their speaker destroyed while at an audition. After failing to sell a guitar to pawn shop owners Jackie Dee ([[Dan Martin (actor)|Dan Martin]]) and Chow (Jack Ung), Stray Bullet manages to convince Mac Daddy, now a successful record producer, to pick them up. However, he drops them when Postmaster P. refuses to make his music more aggressive.  As revenge, the friends break into Mack Daddy’s office and steal his flute, but accidentally free the Leprechaun. The Leprechaun hunts the friends in order to recover his magic flute, which places listeners of its tune in a euphoric trance. After killing some people, such as a reverend, DJ artists, and a hot girl, the Leprechaun reaches the three friends at Postmaster P.'s home. When the rap artists and the Leprechaun engage in a fight, the Leprechaun kills Stray Bullet by making him shoot himself in the mouth with his own pistol while Postmaster P. and Butch stare in horror. Butch visits Postmaster P. at his grandma's house and convinces him to use a joint laced with four-leaf clovers to strip the Leprechaun of his powers in order to steal back the flute.  Postmaster P. and Butch then visit the club in which the Leprechaun has taken up residence. In order to gain entry they dress in drag.  Postmaster P then disenchants the Zombie Fly Girls by having them smoke one of the joints laced with clovers. The duo then goes upstairs to find the Leprechaun who wants the drugged up Postmaster P. to give him a blowjob. Before proceeding any further, the Leprechaun smokes the clover laced joint and passes out. The rap artists take the flute and head downstairs where Mack Daddy shoots Butch, killing him. Postmaster P. retaliates by shooting Mack Daddy three times. No longer under the effects of clover, the Leprechaun comes downstairs and uses magic to pin Postmaster P. against a girder. Postmaster P. then distracts the Leprechaun, allowing the bullet-ridden Mack Daddy to hit the Leprechaun with a wooden chair. Immediately, the Leprechaun uses magic to explode Mack Daddy's torso, but with the last of his strength, Mack Daddy throws the magic amulet in the air.  Cut to a dark stage with much fog and a silhouetted Postmaster P. rapping about how he's finally made it. He moves to the forefront where his eyes are hidden behind sunglasses. He removes the sunglasses to show that his irises glow a neon green, which indicates that he is under the Leprechaun's spell. The Leprechaun then tells the audience that he taught Postmaster P. everything he knows, before rapping about being an evil leprechaun.

Lion of Oz
  The Lion simply called "Lion" is a [[circus]] [[lion]], displayed in a cage where everyone's afraid of him. His only friend is Oscar Diggs, an eccentric and just balloonist, who lets Lion out of his cage and takes him up on his balloon. While they're up there, Oscar gives Lion a Badge of Courage for coming up on his balloon, but they are soon caught in a [[storm]] which drags them to the Land of Oz. Lion falls from the balloon and Oscar can't stop it from leaving and carrying him off. He reminds Lion that "true friends can never be lost" before he is carried away.  Lion comes across a living [[Oak tree|Oak Tree]] being harassed by flying monkeys. Lion frightens them off and the Tree thanks him. Lion realises he can talk just as the Tree can talk. The Tree explains the monkeys serve the Wicked Witch of the East, who appears quickly. Seeing the Badge of Courage, he threatens Lion to find the Flower of Oz for her or he'll never see Oscar again, claiming that Oscar is her prisoner. Tree explains to Lion that The Witch is bent on conquering Oz, but is prevented from total control by the "flower".  Setting out, Lion comes across two fairies, whose friend Starburst is trapped in a chest of emeralds at the bottom of a deep pond. Lion dives in, despite his aversion to water, to save her. During his rescue the Witch's henchman Gloom, a living mist of misery, arrives and tries to tempt Lion with greed into forgetting Starburst and taking as many of the emeralds as he wants, but Lion wisely ignores him and boldly saves the little fairy. Gloom leaves to tell the witch in fury. The fairies gratefully point Lion in the right direction, telling him to go to a certain [[castle]].  As he nearly arrives, he comes across a springy [[teddy bear]] named Silly Oz-bul, who says he needs to cross the [[river]] to get a drink at the castle. Lion points out he can get a drink from the river, which Silly does. He follows Lion to the castle where they are confronted by a [[toy soldier]] named Captain Fitzgerald, who thinks they're enemies storming the castle. Luckily, the misunderstanding is cleared when a young girl named Wimzik and her toy ballerina Caroline come along. Lion explains his mission and they decide to come along with him.  Meanwhile, Gloom reports to the Witch that Lion interfered with his business, so the Witch confronts Lion again, and teleports Fitzgerald to her dungeon, threatening that for each day Lion doesn't find her the Flower of Oz, she'll hurt more of his friends.  Undeterred, the friends keep going until they come to a waterfall. They see a silver [[bridge]] to a floating [[island]] and Silly attempts to cross the bridge, which turns out to be an illusion, and nearly falls over the cliff. Lion saves him, and they hear a voice from the bottom of the cliff telling them to go back, but when Lion announces they're looking for the Flower of Oz, they are invited down by the voice. They come to the town of the Mini-Munchkins, who built the Silver Bridge before it was destroyed by the Wicked Witch of the East, who also them smaller so they couldn't rebuild it. The bridge the group saw was just an illusion caused by the Mini-Munchkins' sadness and doubt. Wimzik inspires them to believe in themselves and not to give up, somehow breaking the Witch's spell over them, returning them to their real sizes and restoring the bridge.  Inside the dungeon, Fitzgerald learns from a flying monkey guard that the Witch never really kidnapped Oscar, and had merely tricked Lion into thinking so.  The group has crossed the bridge and as they go, Caroline's battery runs out, but Wimzik says she only needs some sunlight to recharge it. But then the Witch returns, casting Caroline's unconscious body into a whirlpool. Lion dives in to save her but the current's too strong. Wimzik dives in and helps them to shore, whereupon Lion says somehow Wimzik's touch gave him strength and Caroline is fully charged from Wimzik's touch as well. The Witch leaves, promising that Silly's next.  In the dungeon, Fitzgerald escapes and spies on the Witch while the group come across a cottage, where they are then confronted by the Seamstress, an elderly enchantress with powers over thread, hems, and patchworks, her wand is a large sewing needle. She turns Silly and Caroline into quilt patches but her wand is knocked from her hand by Lion and her living Pin Cushion nails her sleeve to the wall. Realizing the Seamstress is under another of the Witch's dark spells, Wimzik manages to calmly talk the Seamstress into remembering who she really is, breaking the spell and revealing the Seamstress to be a kind person. She turns Silly and Caroline back to their real selves. She then gives them a petal she says came from the Flower of Oz. Lion gets a whiff and tracks it to a large garden encased in ice. When Wimzik touches the flower, the garden is instantly thawed and Lion realizes that they've had the Flower of Oz all along: Wimzik. And the flower she unfroze is really her throne.  The Witch attacks, bringing Gloom with her, as well as Fitzgerald, as he'd stowed along, and reveals the Witch's deception. Righteously enraged, Lion demands an explanation and the Witch reveals Oscar's balloon actually carried him to the distant Emerald City. The Witch tries to destroy Wimzik, but with the combined efforts of Lion, Silly, Fitzgerald, and Caroline, she is thwarted and Wimzik is accidentally seated on her throne, restoring her mystical powers as the Flower of Oz.  Enraged, the Witch spitefully steals Lion's Badge of Courage and sends it to Gloom, who goes after Wimzik. He tries to absorb her, but she is too powerful and he is sent flying into the air (and most likely destroyed). Wimzik orders the Witch to leave, and the Witch swears vengeance before vanishing.  Lion is sad to have lost his badge, now thinking himself no more than a Cowardly Lion. Wimzik explains his courage and everything he's done weren't because of a badge but Lion's brave and noble heart. Despite this, Lion sadly bids his friends goodbye as he must go find his badge and Oscar, but promises to come back someday.  Lion eventually comes across a yellow brick road and meets none other than [[Dorothy Gale]], [[Scarecrow (Oz)|the Scarecrow]], [[Tin Woodman|the Tin Man]], and [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]]. The movie ends with Lion leaping out to meet them, stepping out of his own story and into the course of events of "[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]".

The party is interrupted by [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]]'s sister [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#Morgana|Morgana]], who threatens to have Melody fed to her pet [[tiger shark]], [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#Undertow|Undertow]], unless Triton surrenders his [[trident]] to her. Morgana then announces her plan to use the trident to avenge Ursula and take over the ocean. Ariel and Eric work together to foil Morgana's plan, and Triton shrinks Undertow to the size of a [[piranha]]. Morgana escapes, and eludes the attempt of King Triton's forces to capture her, declaring that she will someday exact her revenge on Ariel and avenge Ursula's death.  Fearing Morgana and remembering Ursula, Ariel decides that, until Morgana is captured, they will have to withhold any and all knowledge of the sea world and her heritage from Melody in order to protect her. Triton tosses the locket into the ocean, and a massive wall is built to separate the royal castle from the sea. Triton assigns [[Sebastian (The Little Mermaid)|Sebastian]] to watch over Melody like he did with Ariel in the first film.  Twelve years later, Melody remains unaware of her mother's [[mermaid]] heritage and is forbidden from ever going into the sea. However, she has been sneaking out of the castle regularly to swim, and one day finds the locket. Seeing her name on the locket, Melody confronts her mother and, but a furious Ariel confronts Melody and forbids her to go into the sea. Frustrated with her mother's refusal to answer her questions, Melody steals a small boat and sails away from home. Melody is discovered by Undertow, who leads her straight to Morgana.  Meanwhile, Sebastian alerts Ariel and Eric that Melody went out to the sea, while Melody meets Morgana. Morgana reveals that Melody's background is marine, and uses the remains of Ursula's magic to transform Melody into a mermaid. Triton prepares search parties, and is convinced by Ariel and Eric to use his trident to transform Ariel back into a mermaid in order to help in the search for Melody. Ariel searches the sea for Melody, regretting not sharing her heritage with her, while Melody explores her newfound abilities as a mermaid, and has a strong feeling that she was meant to be part of the sea.  Melody visits Morgana to thank her, only for Morgana to tell Melody that the spell was only temporary, and that she can only make the spell permanent if Melody retrieves the trident from Triton, claiming that he stole it from her. Melody decides to get the trident, and during her search she befriends Tip and Dash, a [[penguin]] and [[walrus]] duo who join her in her search.  Melody succeeds in stealing the trident, and returns to Morgana, but before Melody can hand the trident over to Morgana, Ariel arrives and pleads for Melody not to listen to Morgana. Melody refuses to listen, having been angered by Ariel's decision to lie to her, and gives Morgana the trident. With the trident in her power, Morgana reveals her true intentions and grabs Melody with her tentacles,then throws her against the wall, trapping her in a cave by sealing the entrance with a thick layer of ice and informing her that her time as a mermaid has just about expired. Soon afterward,on surface Ariel rescues Eric from Cloak and Dagger whom Sebastian pinches. Morgana's spell on Melody wears off, causing her to revert into a human and nearly drowning. Tip and Dash manage to free her and drag her to the shore.  Morgana uses the trident's magic to lord over the ocean, rising to the surface to gloat. Ariel, Flounder, [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#Scuttle|Scuttle]], Triton, [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#Sebastian|Sebastian]], and Eric arrive, and a battle ensues against Morgana and her minions. In the end, after Morgana uses the trident to make Ariel, Flounder, Sebastian, Triton, Tip, and Dash bow down to her in her attempt to revive her sister Ursula and her two pet eels Flotsam and Jetsam, Melody is the one who grabs the trident from Morgana and throws it to Triton. Triton furiously confronts Morgana and encases her in a block of ice, which sinks underwater.  Melody reunites with her family, and Triton offers his granddaughter the choice of becoming a mermaid permanently. Instead, Melody uses the trident to disintegrate the wall separating her home from the sea, reuniting the humans and the merpeople.  
Little Nicky
 The story revolves around a struggle to determine which of [[Satan]]'s three sons will succeed their father ([[Harvey Keitel]]) as ruler of [[Hell]]. Adrian ([[Rhys Ifans]]) is the most devious, Cassius ([[Tom Lister, Jr.|Tom "Tiny" Lister, Jr.]]) is the cruelest, and Nicky ([[Adam Sandler]]) is their father's favorite. Adrian and Cassius claim that Nicky's mother is a goat and torment him by [[Psychokinesis|controlling his body with their minds]]. Nicky has had a speech impediment and a disfigured jaw since Cassius hit him in the face with a shovel.  Having been the [[Prince of Darkness (Satan)|Prince of Darkness]] for ten thousand years, the [[Devil]] assembles his sons to decide which of them will succeed him; he tells them that they are not ready yet, having decided to keep his throne. Angered by this decision, Adrian and Cassius go to Earth to create a new Hell by possessing religious and political leaders in [[New York City]]. As they leave, they freeze the entrance to Hell, preventing more souls from entering and causing Satan's body to begin decomposing. To stop Adrian and Cassius, Satan sends Nicky to Earth with a silver flask that traps whoever drinks from it inside.  At first, Nicky has trouble staying alive on Earth. He is killed several times, landing in Hell and returning to New York each time.  While learning how to eat and sleep, he meets a talking bulldog named Mr. Beefy (voice of [[Robert Smigel]]), rents an apartment with an actor named Todd ([[Allen Covert]]), and falls in love with a design student named Valerie ([[Patricia Arquette]]).  Nicky's first encounter with his brothers occurs when Adrian sees him with Valerie, takes mental control of his body, and makes him scare her away. Then Nicky sees Cassius on television, possessing the referee of a [[Harlem Globetrotters|Globetrotters]] game. When he goes to the court and tricks Cassius into the flask, [[Satanism|Satanist]] [[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]] John ([[Jonathan Loughran]]) and Peter ([[Peter Dante]]) are so thrilled with his performance that they become his devoted fans. That evening, Nicky tries to apologize to Valerie. The meeting goes badly at first, but she accepts him after he explains who he is and why he is on Earth.  The next day, Adrian possesses the Chief of the [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] ([[Michael McKean]]) and accuses Nicky of [[mass murder]]. Not knowing what to do, Nicky has Todd kill him so he can go back to Hell and ask his father for advice, but his father has trouble hearing because his ears have fallen off, and his assistants are in a panic because the midnight deadline to capture Adrian and Cassius is only hours away. Back on Earth again, Nicky and his friends devise a plan to capture Adrian in a subway station, but Adrian discovers their trick. In the ensuing fight, Adrian grabs Valerie and dives onto the track as a train approaches, but Nicky throws her out of the way, leaving himself and Adrian to be killed by the train.  Arriving in Hell just minutes before midnight, Adrian begins the process of taking over Hell by pushing what remains of his father aside and sitting on the throne, rising to [[Central Park]], and starting a riotous party. Meanwhile, Nicky wakes up in [[Heaven]] as a reward for sacrificing himself and meets his mother ([[Reese Witherspoon]]), an angel who tells him he can defeat Adrian with the Inner Light he inherited from her. After she gives him a mysterious orb, he goes to Central Park. Adrian appears to win a pitched battle by locking Nicky in the flask and turning himself into a bat, but Nicky escapes from the flask. When he shatters the orb, [[Ozzy Osbourne]] appears, bites Adrian's head off, and spits it into the flask.  With his brothers captured, Nicky is ready to save his father. After he sins to make sure he goes to Hell, he and Valerie express their love for each other and she kills him. In Hell, Satan regains his body and recommends that Nicky go back to Earth. The film ends a year later, when Nicky and Valerie live in New York with their infant son.

One night, while dressed up as a vampire, Tony is mistaken for one by the young vampire Rudolph ([[Rollo Weeks]]), who is on the run from the evil vampire hunter Rookery ([[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]]).  After realizing that Tony is not a vampire, Rudolph tries to attack him but ultimately fails due to being weakened by Rookery.

Some time later, while visiting the village market, Tony spots Rudolph and his family, now human, moving into a house in the village. At first they seem not to recognize Tony, but as Tony does the Whistle to them their memories return, and the friends are reunited.  
Lockdown (2000 film)
 In [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], Avery Montgomery (Jones) is taking time off from college to spend time with his girlfriend Krista ([[Melissa De Sousa]]), and help raise their young son. Avery is an avid swimmer and develops to a championship level, and as a result of a particularly impressive win which catches the eye of a scout, he gets the opportunity for a possible scholarship at a college.  Cashmere (Casseus), a drug dealer, happens to be one of Avery's best friends, despite the fact that their personalities and lifestyles are quite different, Avery being the one who stays out of trouble. With their barber friend Dre ([[De'aundre Bonds]]), the trio have been friends since childhood.  Earlier in the day before the swim meet, Cashmere had a run-in with Broadway ([[Sticky Fingaz]]), another dealer who works under Cashmere in the hierarchy. Broadway happened to be short on money in his return, and it angered Cashmere, who proceeds to kick Broadway down a flight of metal stairs and pull out a gun to assert his power, threatening to kill him if he does not pay back what he owes.  Broadway runs off, but vows to get revenge and, after an attempted robbery later in the day where he shoots and kills a woman at a [[drive-through]], he wipes off his gun and tosses it into the backseat of Cashmere's open convertible when he is out of the car, which looks similar enough to Broadway's car to be mistaken for it.  After the swim meet, Cashmere and Dre, who are there to cheer him on, convince Avery to come out and celebrate his big victory. At a certain point, Dre, who is riding in the back seat, finds the gun, and questions Cashmere about it but Cashmere has no idea where it came from. As they were arguing over how to get rid of it, some cops spot them and, thinking their car looks similar to Broadway's, pull them over. One of the officers orders them out of the car at gunpoint, which they obey, but a few moments later Cashmere's pit bull runs toward the officer, who shoots the dog dead. Cashmere pulls out the gun in anger, but is shot in the shoulder and knocked down.  After being wrongfully convicted of Broadway's crime, the three are sent to the same prison to serve a ten-year prison sentence. Each man experiences different events: Cashmere beats up and threatens his cellmate; Dre is raped and turned to a prison sex slave by his psychotic cellmate named Graffiti ([[David "Shark" Fralick]]), who controls much of the prison's drug flow and is the leader of a [[neo-Nazi]] gang; and Avery meets and befriends an old cellmate named Malachi Young ([[Clifton Powell]]) who has been in jail for 18 years and is nearing the end of his sentence. Graffiti's rival, Clean Up ([[Master P]]) is another drug trafficker who Cashmere begins to work for.  Meanwhile, Charles Pierce ([[Bill Nunn]]), the college scout who Avery met on his fateful night, believes that Avery was wrongfully convicted and decides to help him appeal the sentence, along with his daughter, a lawyer. Avery is resentful and resistant at first, towards both Pierce and Krista (at one point yelling at her to never come back because it "would do them both better") but eventually accepts their visitations and attempts to help.  Graffiti continues to successfully smuggle drugs into prison by swallowing packets of drugs brought by his girlfriends. In a fight for the control of the prison drug trade, Clean Up successfully executes a plan to kill a rival drug dealer, a former professional football player working for Graffiti as the man is killed with a barbell crushing his windpipe which is made to look like an accident. A corrupt guard named Perez who is on Graffiti's payroll warns the neo-Nazi not to [[retaliate]] but Graffiti and the gang kill one of Clean Up's men anyway. His dead body is found in the prison laundry room, and the warden orders a lockdown to punish the prisoners. The prisoners suffer [[Social isolation|isolation]] in their cells while Graffiti continues to rape Dre.  After the lockdown finally ends, Dre starts injecting heroin and one day snaps and attacks Graffiti. Graffiti eventually gets the upper hand back and starts to beat him up. Avery, who was on his way to see Dre after his girlfriend asked him to look after him, despite Malachi's warnings not get involved, jumps in to protect Dre and starts pummeling Graffiti. A brawl erupts as the other Neo Nazi's come to Graffiti's aid and Malachi jumps into the fight, throwing one of Graffiti's men over the second floor railing, before the COs subdue the inmates.  Malachi, Avery, Graffiti, Dre and the others involved have to go to a disciplinary hearing, in which Malachi, in an act of sacrifice (after being allowed to go in first upon his request), takes responsibility for the entire incident to spare Avery a discipline record and assault charge. Malachi also intimidates the disciplinary panel by getting into an episode of rage to makes his confession believable, which ends up with him being transferred to another prison. Avery is grateful to Malachi and the old prisoner leaves Avery a parting gift - a copy of [[Ralph Ellison]]'s ''[[Invisible Man]]'' with a shank hidden inside. Avery soon gets a new young cellmate who he tries to mentor just as Malachi mentored him.  Cashmere and Clean Up approach Dre telling him that he must kill Graffiti or he would soon end up being killed by him. Cashmere offers Dre drugs. Soon, high on drugs, Dre approaches Graffiti at a gospel concert at the prison and stabs him to death. Dre is himself killed with a blow to the head from the nightstick of the crooked guard Perez.  Soon afterward, Clean Up's drug mule is arrested on intel provided by Cashmere's vengeful cellmate. Furious, Clean Up believes there is an informant who sabotaged his operation. He blames it on the new arrival Cashmere, but Cashmere denies his involvement. Cashmere suggests that Avery must have been the informant as they revealed their drug smuggling operation to him when they unsuccessfully tried to recruit him. Clean Up orders Cashmere to kill Avery.  Tensions run high in the prison with the power vacuum after Graffiti's death and soon a riot spontaneously develops in the prison yard, with prisoners from rival gangs jumping in to settle their scores. In the chaos, during which a number of COs and prisoners are killed, Cashmere attacks Avery with a shank and they get into a mortal combat. Cashmere is about to kill his former friend when he has a change of heart and wavers. Clean Up then shows up and attacks Cashmere and Avery but ends up being stabbed to death by Cashmere. Cashmere and Avery are about to embrace but a prison guard shoots Cashmere dead, thinking he was going to attack Avery.  Broadway, likely affected by the appeals of Avery's visiting girlfriend to exonerate Avery and help his son have a father, hangs himself in prison and writes a confession to the murder of the fast food clerk for which Avery was framed. Charles Pierce and his daughter bring the confession to a judge who grants Avery a release. Avery is shortly released. He enjoys swimming in the pool again and the company of Krista and his son.

Looking for Alibrandi (film)
 ''Looking for Alibrandi'' begins light-heartedly, and the viewer gets a very quick understanding of Josie's character through her interactions with her friends and family. As the film progresses, the glamour that is initially associated with Josie begins to fade as she struggles to cope with her final year of school (especially the racist attitude of one girl in particular, Carly Bishop ([[Leeanna Walsman]]), the suicide of her crush, John Barton ([[Matthew Newton]]), and meeting with Michael Andretti ([[Anthony LaPaglia]]), her father, who has only just found out about her existence upon returning to Sydney for work. She also has continual conflict with her grandmother, Katia Alibrandi ([[Elena Cotta]]).  However, these complications are seemingly resolved quickly, in keeping with Josie's brusque and forthright outlook on life. For example, in response to Carly's continuous snide remarks, she breaks her tormentor's nose with a history textbook. It is this summary act that brings her father back into her life.  Another complication—the suicide of her close friend and unrequited crush, John Barton—tests her resilience. Struggling with her grief, she finds comfort to a certain extent within Jacob Coote, he was a 'bad boy' on the outside, but he was found out to be a sincere and caring person on the inside.  The most significant complication and challenge for Josie, though, is her rocky relationship with her father, Michael Andretti. When they finally get to know each other, and recognise themselves in each other, their rift heals, and she can confide in him.

 Paul Tannek ([[Jason Biggs]]), a small-town, intelligent kid from Upstate New York is accepted into NYU on an academic scholarship. Trying to follow the advice of his father ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) he tries to gain friends by trying to be polite and interested in others. His attempts are noticed by his new roommates Chris ([[Thomas Sadoski]]), Adam ([[Zak Orth]]) and Noah ([[Jimmi Simpson]]), three rich, spoiled, obnoxious city boys who consider his polite behavior, [[working class]] background and determination for education lame and brand him a loser. To salvage their reputation, the trio concoct a false story to the housing administration about Paul's attitude and have him thrown out of the dorm. Paul takes residence in a veterinary hospital. Chris meets Paul and again concocts another story about how they were trying to help him as a ploy for Paul to let them use the hospital to throw parties since a resident at the dorm fell into sickness due to excessive alcohol, forbidding them to hold any parties thereon.  Paul meets classmate Dora Diamond ([[Mena Suvari]]) and develops an attraction to her, unaware that she is having an affair with their decorated but highly pretentious English professor Edward Alcott ([[Greg Kinnear]]). Dora is equally as intelligent as Paul but doesn't have a scholarship and works shifts as a waitress in a strip club to pay for her tuition until she is unceremoniously fired. To avoid a long daily commute which she can no longer afford, Dora asks Alcott to let her live with him for a while to which he selfishly declines for fear of losing his tenure at the university if their relationship is found out. Paul and Dora bump into each other one night and Paul invites her to an [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]] concert after discovering when they met that she is a fan. Dora agrees to the date, but first goes to a job interview for a night shift in a convenience store, but is denied the position because she's a woman.

They steal a loaf of bread from a bakery, coffee from a dispenser in the park and sneak into a Broadway show. Paul goes out to grab a pizza and a movie for both of them hoping it may lead to something further between them only to return to find Alcott with Dora and learning that Alcott has changed his mind about Dora living with him. Alcott reveals to Dora that Chris, Noah and Adam are blackmailing him with the knowledge of their relationship in return for a passing grade on their transcript and also tells her that he believes Paul is in on it. After discovering roofies were involved at the party, he steals Noah's supply and replaces them with placebos. Paul then pays a visit to Alcott's office to ask how Dora is doing and is instead given his final exam as a take-home test by Alcott to buy his silence, Paul takes the moral high ground and refuses the test, jeopardizing his scholarship and place in the university.  Dora, since living with Alcott, has become his errand-girl and overhears Paul on the phone with his father talking about how much he misses her. Alcott then admits he learned that Paul had nothing to do with the blackmail, but still intends to fail him.

Afterwards, Adam, Noah, and Chris' behavior get the better of them and their lives plummet into failure, Alcott is found out and sent to prison for having an affair with a different student, and Paul and Dora remain happy in their relationship.  
Love & Basketball
 Monica ([[Sanaa Lathan]]) and Quincy ([[Omar Epps]]) have wanted to be [[National Basketball Association|professional basketball]] stars since they were kids. Monica wanted to play for the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and wear [[Magic Johnson|Magic Johnson's]] number: 32. Quincy wanted to be like his father and play for the [[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers]], wearing number 22. However, Monica has to work hard to establish herself, while Quincy was born with natural star potential. As the two struggle to reach their goals of playing professionally, they must also deal with their emotions for each other.  The film spans roughly thirteen years of friendship between childhood sweethearts Monica Wright and Quincy McCall. The first quarter of the story begins in 1981, when Monica (played as a youth by [[Kyla Pratt]]) and her family moved to Los Angeles from [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and quickly became acquainted with their new neighbors the McCalls. They are a wealthy family due to the success of Quincy's father Zeke, who was the star shooting guard for the [[Los Angeles Clippers]].  Quincy and Monica are drawn to each other instantly, sharing a love of the game: [[basketball]]. Quincy (played as a youth by [[Glendon Chattman]]) is shocked that a girl could ever love basketball as much as he did. He is even more shocked when Monica plays so well. Their first interaction results in Quincy angrily knocking her down during game point and accidentally scarring her face. However, the next day, they share their first kiss on the first day of school and end the "first quarter" of the story fighting in the grass.  The second quarter of the story begins in 1988, when both Monica and Quincy are the respective leaders of their high school teams. Scouts have taken clear notice of Quincy, who many see as one of the top prospects in the country. His popularity was not just evident on the court as he is extremely popular with the other students. He could have any girl in school that he wanted, but he is still good friends and neighbors with Monica.  Monica, on the other hand, struggles with her various fiery emotions on the court. This often resulted in technical fouls at critical moments of games, getting benched, and eventually pushing away many potential scouting opportunities due to her lack of control. Aside from her emotions on the court, Monica also struggles with the emotions she secretly still harbors for Quincy. Often, she struggles to express them as he is always surrounded by other girls. Monica also has problems with her mother Camille, who is a stay at home wife and mother. Ever since she was a little girl, Monica has been pressured by Camille to give up basketball and "act like a lady." This leads to the point, where Camille would force her to wear dresses and skirts against her will. This has continued into her high school years, with Camille still complaining that Monica is too much of a "[[tomboy]]" and needs to learn to be more feminine. This prompts Monica to feel hurt and resentful of her mother for not accepting her for who she is. She even refuses to embrace the domestic "housewife" work that her mother seems to enjoy so much. Through soul searching throughout the season, Monica learns to control her emotions and leads her team to the state championship game. Unfortunately, both she and her team came up short leading them to a victory. This left Monica devastated and in tears.  Later on, Monica begins to recover from the championship loss with the help of her older sister, Lena, who gives her a makeover. She even finds Monica a college friend to take her to her spring dance. With nothing more than a new hair style and a dress, Monica shows up to the spring dance looking as beautiful as ever. Despite having a date of his own, Quincy notices her and immediately walks over to her to compliment her new appearance. However, he doesn't hesitate to comment on her date. They both show jealousy towards each others' dates and part ways instead. Later that night, they both speak outside her window and reveal to each other how their dates didn't meet their needs. She also lets him know that she has a letter from [[University of Southern California|USC]] and insists on him to open it. After the letter reveals that she has been accepted, he finally stated that [[University of Southern California|USC]] was also his choice. As they move in to congratulate each other with a hug, Monica mistakes the gesture as a kiss. This action leads to them finally acting on their feelings for one another by [[sexual intercourse|making love to each other]]. It was Monica's first time.  The third quarter of the story follows Quincy and Monica to their freshman year at [[University of Southern California|USC]] in 1988-89, where they are managing themselves as athletes, students, and a couple. Again, the same problems seem to present themselves, this time on a bigger stage. While Quincy finds instant success on the court, as well as more and more female admirers, Monica struggles for playing time, being the backup to [[University of Southern California|USC]]'s senior guard, Sidra O'Neal. To make matters worse, she falls on the bad side of the head coach, Ellie Davis. She reprimands Monica both for showing off and for her lack of defense. Her relationship with Quincy becomes more and more strained. Meanwhile, Quincy struggles to deal with the media attention surrounding his father, who is trying to convince Quincy to finish college first before going pro, and a paternity suit against him from a former lover. Quincy feels betrayed by his father for lying to him. He threatens to leave school for the [[NBA]] early, despite his father begging him not to sacrifice his education just to spite him. Zeke mentions that his mom was only nineteen when she was [[pregnancy|pregnant]] with Quincy and he wasn't ready for a family, but he stayed anyway. Monica finally earns the starting point guard spot at the end of the season. However, Quincy can't be happy for her, because he blames her for not being there for him when he was having problems with his father. Monica is hurt deeply by Quincy, leading the two of them to go their separate ways.  The fourth quarter of the story follows the characters through the early 1990s, a few years before the establishment of the [[WNBA]]. In 1993, Monica's prospects for professional basketball lie exclusively in the IWBA, the International Women's Basketball Association, while Quincy steps into the pros at home. Monica settles into her new life in [[Barcelona]], where she struggles to cope with the everyday grind of playing overseas away from family and friends. She misses home, but can't imagine a life that didn't include [[basketball]]. It was revealed earlier in college, where Sidra points out that Big Toni, their teammate at [[University of Southern California|USC]], quits the previous year and now works at a bookstore. Monica tries to adapt to her surroundings as a local sports celebrity and the focal point of the team's offense. She leads her team to a dominant victory in the championship game at the end of the season. Despite all of her personal success, Monica starts to realize that her love for basketball isn't the same as it was before.  Having left [[University of Southern California|USC]] five years earlier after his freshman season, Quincy is now in his fifth year in the pros. He tries to find a role with his new team, the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. The moment he finally finds some playing time, he injures himself landing awkwardly after a [[slam-dunk]] and tearing his [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]]. His family rushes to the [[hospital]] to be with him, but his now divorced parents still have bad blood when they see each other. After Monica hears about Quincy's injury, she flies home to see him.  Monica goes to the [[hospital]] to visit Quincy, and is stunned to hear of Quincy's engagement and to meet his fiancée ([[Tyra Banks]]). After her meeting with Quincy, Monica soon realizes that her feelings for him still exist. Monica also clashes with her mother Camille again over old resentments, causing Camille to remark that she had to give up her own dreams after having two daughters. Camille also shows open resentment towards Monica for not appreciating the sacrifices she made for her family. However, Monica counter-argued that Camille never made her feel loved and accepted, because she kept trying to force her to give up her goals for a stereotypical "woman's role" in life that she didn't want. Over the next few months, Quincy undergoes [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]], while the day of his wedding draws closer. By this time, Monica has decided to give up basketball and work at a bank with her dad instead. When Quincy asks Monica, she states that it was no longer fun for her. However, Quincy does not understand, stating that he never knew anyone who loved basketball as much as she did. After seeing how truly unhappy her youngest daughter is without either basketball or Quincy (or both) in her life, Camille finally relents and encourages Monica to fight for her dreams and the man she loves. Quincy and Monica meet up, this time as friends, and reminisce over their shared past. At this point, Quincy has recovered from his injury, and Monica finally steps up with an ultimatum. She challenges him to one final game on the court. However, this time, the stakes are higher: if he loses, he calls off the wedding and chooses Monica. If not, he marries his fiancée. Her reasoning is that if he loses, it would be, because he let her win, which would mean that, deep down, he really doesn't want to get married, because he still loves her. Quincy agrees and beats her in the game, but can no longer be apart from Monica and chooses her instead. The phrase "double or nothing" brings a whole new meaning to the game.  The film fast-forwards to five years later in 1998. Monica has finally gone pro in the [[WNBA]], which was created two years earlier by the [[NBA]] in 1996. The movie ends with Quincy helping their baby daughter cheer on Monica during her game. The back of her jersey is seen with the name "Wright-McCall", showing that Monica and Quincy got married. In the closing post-credit scene, Quincy and Monica's toddler daughter is seen in the backyard, running and putting her [[basketball (ball)|basketball]] into her toy [[basketball hoop]].

Love & Sex
 When her rather explicit copy on [[oral sex]] is rejected, magazine journalist Kate Welles ([[Famke Janssen]]) is told by her editor, Monique ([[Ann Magnuson]]), to write an article on loving relationships instead—and to do so by the end of the day or face being fired. This gets Kate thinking back over her own various misadventures searching for love over the years, and wondering if she is in much of a position to write on the subject.  Kate's first relationship, a playground romance in grade school with a boy named Bobby, ends when Kate's friend spills the details of their relationship to the entire school, humiliating Bobby. Kate goes on to lose her virginity to her ineloquent high school French teacher, Mr. Boussard, whom she accidentally insinuates has a small [[penis]]. Kate's next relationship, in college while attending [[UCLA]], is with another older man, a music video director named Eric ([[Noah Emmerich]]). Things go well with Eric for several weeks until Eric's wife and child show up unannounced while he and Kate are about to have sex; unaware that Eric was married with children, Kate storms off, heartbroken.  Kate meets the love of her life, Adam Levy ([[Jon Favreau]]), while attending the latter's art show while on a date with Richard, a boring, miserable stand-up comedian. Adam steals Kate away from Richard effortlessly. The two become instant best friends over the course of their first date, and begin living together as a happy couple thereafter. On the eve of their one-year anniversary, Kate reveals that she is pregnant. The two decide to bring the baby to term, but Kate suffers a miscarriage a few weeks later, to the emotional distress of both.  Over the next few months, the honeymoon period of Kate and Adam's relationship comes to an end, as each reveals personality traits that annoy the other. This finally culminates one night when Adam realizes that he is not happy in their relationship any longer—in his words, the timing is just off—and he wants to break up. Kate, devastated that her first successful relationship is ending, seesaws between feigned relief that they are breaking up, and her actual heartbreak. Adam moves out and begins dating other women, further distressing Kate. Kate ups the ante by becoming involved with other men simply to make Adam jealous, which slowly begins to work. After numerous fights, Kate and Adam admit that they must stop intentionally hurting each other if any friendship is to be kept between them.  Kate meets a dimwitted but good-natured B-list Hollywood actor named Joey Santino, and begins to date him. Adam's relationships with other women fizzle out, and as Kate and Joey grow more serious, he begins to realize that Kate was the right woman for him all along. Adam pleads and negotiates with Kate to take him back, but Kate refuses, reiterating what Adam said previously about bad timing. Kate finally breaks up with Joey after tiring of his lack of intellect. Adam again offers his love to a now-single Kate, but Kate, still wary of the timing, only accepts his friendship.  As the evening deadline for her copy approaches, Kate realizes that she cannot do Monique's assignment, and avoids being fired by voluntarily quitting on the spot with a hasty apology. Back at home, she prepares for a blind date with a man named Rob. A montage of everything Kate and Adam went through together—the highs and the lows of their relationship—plays in her mind. The scene then cuts to another gallery opening of Adam's. Kate shows up, having realized that the timing is finally right and that she and Adam were meant to be. Adam and Kate reconcile with a kiss and begin their relationship afresh, each a little wiser for the wear.

 The film is set in a [[red-light district]] of [[Mannheim]], [[Germany]] and depicts five illegal immigrants on the fringes of society. Georgian Merab (Lasha Bakradze) and Croatian Branko ([[Misel Maticevic]]) have trouble finding employment and end up trying to work as paid contract killers. Their first assignment is to kill a Russian businessman (Viktor Benzler) but Merab does not have the stomach for murder. Branko also sells drugs in order to earn a living for himself and his dying mother Dusica ([[Dito Tsintsadze]]). Their lives become intertwined with three other outsiders.  Carlos, a former martial artist (Elie James Blezes) from Haiti wants to sell one of his kidneys to get enough money to move to Australia. He also earns some money as a street musician.

Love's Labour's Lost (film)
 The King of [[Navarre]] has vowed to avoid romantic entanglements to spend three years in study and contemplation. His chief courtiers agree to follow him in this vow, though one (Berowne) argues that they will not be able to fulfill this plan.  Berowne's claim is proven correct almost instantly. The Princess of France comes to Navarre to discuss the status of the province of [[Aquitaine]]. Though the King does not grant them access to his palace (they are forced to camp outside), each of the courtiers falls in love with one of her handmaidens, and the King falls in love with the Princess herself.  The men attempt to hide their own loves and expose those of their fellows. After a masked ball in which the pairs of lovers are comically mismatched, all the amours are revealed. Costard leads a musical number with the King's court, which eventually includes the entire cast. But as the song closes, a messenger arrives with news of the King of France's death. As the year of mourning that will proceed for the princess and her ladies means further courtship is impossible, and the women had until this point treated the men's courtship as nothing but a mocking merriment to entertain their guests, they request demonstrations of humility and constancy from the men, with a promise to marry them at the end of the 12 months if they carry out these acts.   Newsreel footage shows the character's lives over the course of that year, which takes place in the context of [[World War II]]. The montage ends with all those who survived the war (Boyett we specifically see die in some covert military action) reuniting in celebration on what appears to be [[Victory_in_Europe_Day|VE Day]].   The comic underplot of the original play, in which Costard and others attempt to stage a play (rather like that of the [[Mechanical (character)|rude mechanicals]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', though with more pretensions to learning) is severely curtailed, as is the boasting of the Spaniard, Don Armado.

Love/Juice
 Twenty-something lesbian Chinatsu shares a one-bedroom apartment with heterosexual Kyoko. Although Chinatsu and Kyoko have a passing attraction, Kyoko is mostly interested in men, especially one who tends the fish in a pet store, who despite her efforts, doesn't seem to be interested in her.  
Love Torn in a Dream
 Opening in black and white with a puzzlingly self-aware narrated scene of Love Torn Within a Dream producer Paulo Branco welcoming the cast at a celebratory ceremony, the film quickly establishes (with the help of an illustrated configuration upon a chalkboard, one that explicitly references the theories of [[Ramon Lull]]’s ''[[De Arte Combinatoria|ars combinatoria]]'', one of Ruiz’s ongoing artistic preoccupations) that there are nine stories that will weave in and out of each other throughout the film: The Meditations, The Robber Mirror, Twenty Two Rings, The Healing Painting, The Discussion, The Pirate’s Treasure, The Prophetic Site, The Castle of Dreams, and The Traveling Companion. Through overlapping threads and exchanged objects, these nine stories form some supposed twelve in total, though the situation becomes increasingly jumbled and less clear as the film goes on. A handful of actors portray different characters across storylines and centuries – Lucrezia, the nun-turned mystical nymph is played by the same woman ([[Elsa Zylberstein]]) who portrays modern-day Jessica who interacts with Paul, a student disturbed by a website foretelling his future. Paul is played by the same actor ([[Melvil Poupaud]]) who plays the troubled young Catholic who discovers he is Jewish, while many pirates and thieves, corpses and even the devil exchange actors in less pronounced roles throughout the film.  Themes of a young theology student grappling with doubts over institutional ideologies and hypocrisy, the dangerous power of storytelling, shifting and self-proclaimed denial of identities, as well as piracy, charmed objects which act upon the bearers rather than the other way around, maps, and cannibalism are all recognizable as curious preoccupations and trademarks of Ruiz’s work to any seasoned fan.  
The Luzhin Defence
 It's the early 1920s and Aleksandr Ivanovich 'Sascha' Luzhin (Turturro), a gifted but tormented chess player, arrives in a Northern Italian city to compete in an international chess competition. Prior to the tournament he meets Natalia Katkov (Watson) and he falls in love with her almost immediately. She in turn finds his manner to be appealing and they begin to see each other in spite of her mother's disapproval.  Competing alongside Luzhin in the championship is Dottore Salvatore Turati ([[Fabio Sartor]]), who is approached by Leo Valentinov ([[Stuart Wilson (actor)|Stuart Wilson]]), a Russian, who is Luzhin's former chess tutor from pre-revolutionary Russia. Valentinov tells the Italian that Luzhin cannot handle pressure and he intimates he will make sure that his former prodigy will be unsettled off-table giving Turati a winning chance.  The competition starts badly for Luzhin who is unsettled by the presence of his former friend and coach. He struggles through the early rounds but he soon begins to win again as his relationship with Katkov becomes closer and intimate. She then informs her parents that she is going to marry him. Meanwhile, Luzhin goes on to reach the final and face Turati.   But in the finals the Russian [[Émigré]] loses out to the time clock, forcing the game to adjourn. However, outside the venue, he is whisked away by an accomplice of Valentinov who abandons him in the countryside. His former teacher knows that this will completely unhinge him because of the memory of his parents' abandonment many years ago. Luzhin wanders aimlessly until he collapses and is found by a group of [[Blackshirts]].  Luzhin is taken to the hospital suffering from complete mental exhaustion. The doctor informs Katkov that he will die if he keeps playing chess as he is addicted to the game and it's consuming his very being. Nevertheless, even while recuperating Valentinov comes around with a chess board encouraging Luzhin to finish the match with the Italian, Turati. Natalia defends her beloved but urges him to break off with the game. Luzhin seems to agree.  Eventually Luzhin leaves the hospital. He and Natalia then agree to marry at the earliest opportunity. However, on the morning of the wedding, Luzhin is put into a car with Valentinov, who tells him that there is the small matter of finishing the competition. In terror, Luzhin leaps from the car. Dazed, cut and mentally confused, he stumbles back to the hotel where he tries to dig up the rest of the glass chess pieces he buried on the grounds years ago, (1:36:39 "I've got the King but I need the whole army...") but he does not find them.  Luzhin, who is in his muddied wedding suit, sits in his room as Natalia and the hotel staff try to open the door. But before they can get in, the troubled chess grandmaster throws himself out of his bedroom window and dies. The tragic death is witnessed by Valentinov who has just arrived by car.  The film then concludes in the competition hall where Natalia completes the competition using her fiancé's notes. She discovers the papers in his pocket and an experienced chess player explains to her the matter of the notes. In an arranged meeting without  public she plays against  Turati who does exactly what Luzhin expected and loses. Katkov and Turati then leave acknowledging the [[Pyrrhic victory]] and the genius of Luzhin.

After her acquittal, her advocate calls round and rapes her.   Renato decides to be Malèna's protector, asking God and his saints to watch over her and performing little acts of vengeance against her detractors. He does not realise that his views of her are little better than those of the townspeople, and has no idea how Malèna herself feels.   Meanwhile, the war reaches Sicily and the town is bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], killing her father. Now penniless and universally scorned, with nobody willing to give her work, she sinks into prostitution. The townsfolk are happy to see her as a whore rather than a dangerous widow. When [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] forces occupy the town and Renato encounters his idol with two German soldiers, he faints. His mother decides it is [[demonic possession]], taking him to a priest for [[exorcism]], but his more practical father takes the lad to the town brothel. There he fantasises that the prostitute initiating him is Malèna.  The Germans leave, and to ecstatic cheers [[US Army|American]] troops enter the town. The women storm the brothel and drag out Malèna, ripping off her clothes, beating her and cutting off her hair. To escape further persecution, she leaves the hostile town. A few days later, her husband Nino, who has survived as a prisoner of war but lost an arm, comes back looking for her. His house has been taken over by displaced people and nobody can tell him how to find his wife. Renato leaves him an anonymous note saying that she still loves him but has suffered misfortunes and gone to the city of [[Messina]].  A year later, Nino and Malèna are strolling happily through the town. Struck by her courage and devotion, seeing her now as a wife who looks more matronly, people begin speaking of her with more respect. When she goes to the market, the women say good morning and call her madam. Walking home, some fruit falls from her bag and Renato rushes to pick it up. He wishes her good luck and she gives him an enigmatic half-smile, the only time either has ever spoken to or looked openly at the other.  In a final voice-over, the aged Renato reflects that he has known and loved many women and has forgotten all of them. The only one he can never forget is Malèna.  
The Man Who Cried
 Fegele Abramovich ([[Christina Ricci]]), a [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Russian Jew]] is separated from her father ([[Oleg Yankovsky]]) as a child in 1927. Her father has travelled to America to seek his fortune and plans to send for Fegele and her grandmother. Before leaving, he sings "Je Crois Entendre Encore" from the [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]] opera ''[[Les pêcheurs de perles]]'' to her. After her father leaves, the village is attacked and burned in a [[pogrom]]. Fegele escapes with the help of neighbours; after overcoming many obstacles, she is crowded onto a boat headed for Britain, with only a photo of her father and a coin given to her by her grandmother.  Upon arrival, an English official renames her "Susan" and places her with foster parents. English students at school taunt her by calling her a [[Romani people|"gypsy"]], but she does not yet understand English. A teacher at the school overhears her singing "Je Crois Entendre Encore" in Yiddish, and teaches her to sing and speak in English.   Time passes, and Suzie auditions for a singing dance troupe heading for Paris. There, she meets an older Russian dancer named Lola ([[Cate Blanchett]]), and they share an apartment as friends. At a formal party, both women perform as dancers alongside a mysterious performing horseman, Cesar ([[Johnny Depp]]), a [[Romani people|Romani]] to whom Suzie is attracted. After their performance outside, they overhear a tenor inside singing "Je Crois Entendre Encore"; the voice belongs to Dante ([[John Turturro]]), an Italian opera singer who immediately catches Lola's eye. Lola works her way into his good graces and falls for his charms, enticed by his wealth and success. Dante, Lola, Suzie, and Cesar all work for an opera company directed by Felix Perlman ([[Harry Dean Stanton]]). Dante is an imperious follower of Mussolini; this alienates him from Suzie even as he becomes Lola's lover. Meanwhile, Cesar introduces Suzie to his "family" (essentially his entire tribe), and they fall in love.  One day, Dante is rifling through Suzie's things after a dalliance with Lola in the apartment, and deduces her Jewish heritage after finding her father's photo. An elderly Jewish neighbour downstairs, Madame Goldstein ([[Miriam Karlin]]), also knows that Suzie is Jewish and has warned her of the dangers on the horizon as the [[Invasion of Poland|Germans invade Poland]]. The following year, as the [[Battle of France|Germans invade France]] and approach Paris, an exodus begins of Jews and other people threatened by [[Nazism]]. Crowds for the operatic show dwindle, and eventually the only cast members left are Dante and Suzie. When Dante attempts to seduce Suzie, she rebuffs him. He lashes out at her for her heritage and her relationship with Cesar, whose heritage he also scorns. Perlman comes to her defence; he reminds Dante that as an Italian in Paris at that time, should Mussolini align with the Nazis, Dante's own position in Paris would be precarious. Perlman closes down the show; the Nazis enter Paris the following morning.  Dante reluctantly returns to his earlier role as minstrel. After another rebuff from Suzie, Dante reveals to a German officer that Suzie is a Jew. Lola overhears this and informs Suzie that she is in danger and must leave Paris. Lola has also decided to leave Dante and has purchased tickets for Suzie and herself on an ocean liner headed for America. The same night of the party, the Nazis attack the Romani village and kill a child. When Cesar comes to her apartment to say goodbye, Suzie expresses her desire to stay and help Cesar fight the Nazis for his family, but he tells her she must flee and find her father. They share a tender last evening together.  Suzie searches for her father and discovers that he changed his name, gave up singing, and moved west after hearing about the attack on his home village, which he assumed killed all the members of his family. Suzie goes to Hollywood, where her father was a studio head, and discovers he has a new family and that he is dying. She goes to the hospital, walks past his new wife and children who are waiting outside the door to his room, and is reunited with her father. He recognises her and expresses joy at her appearance. She sits on the side of his bed and sings "Je Crois Entendre Encore" to him in Yiddish as tears roll down her face.

Mask of Desire
  The setting is the increasingly less visible ritual face of Kathmandu. Dipak, boyishly handsome, in his mid 1930s, a former football player in the army, works as an uniformed guard for a successful business. Saraswati, younger by two years, is a homely, virtuous woman, who adores her footballer husband. They live in a modest two-room apartment on the second floor of an old brick building with their two young girls, an ordinary, humble family, happy in most respects.  There is much anxiety over Saraswati’s imminent pregnancy. For, if there is one thing that life - or the gods - hasn’t given them, it is a son. Not unusual for a family in their society, it is an unresolved thread in their otherwise contented lives. Dipak wants a son, Saraswati wants him to be happy – these are sometimes deep-seated, other times lurking, desires which, if realized, will make their lives that much better.  One day, while doing her usual prayers at the Shiva-lingam shrine, a sadhu mysteriously appears and tells her only the goddess Tripura at the small brick shrine by the riverbank can answer her prayers. Saraswati does so hesitantly, and when a son is born she begins to believe her prayers were responsible. The couple’s joy is short-lived, however, for a few weeks later, the infant dies, bringing in its wake sorrow, anger, and guilt.  The once-happy family begins to breaks down. Saraswati becomes intermittently ill and begins to experience bouts of depression. When she finally goes back to the goddess who she believes gave her a son, only to cause her greater sorrow, the same sadhu appears and suggests she get “treated” by the jhankrini who is the spirit medium of the Tripura goddess.  Parallelly, we learn that the jhankrini, reputed as a healer, has her own particular history. As a young woman she had been married off to a mentally disturbed boy-husband, who kept running away from her and from life apparently, eventually committing suicide. It is known that people in vulnerable and unstable states are often “chosen” to be mediums for deities. Gita’s marriage and her sick husband’s tragic fate had made her gravely ill, causing her intense emotional turmoil, breakdowns, and visions, until she was diagnosed as being a “possessed”.  The jhankrini remains deeply ambivalent about the role that is thrust on her, and deeply yearning human love, however. All along, her relative and man-attendant warns her not to digress from her extraordinary path, hinting at the dire consequences of doing so.  It is not only fate but also their inner wants that bring Dipak, Saraswati and Gita (the jhankrini) together. Saraswati’s “treatment” by the jhankrini appears to be efficacious. In time the three become socially acquainted. Saraswati is grateful to the jhankrini and also fascinated by the spirit medium, the jhankrini is touched by Saraswati’s and Dipak’s relationship, and by the boyish innocence of Dipak, which eventually serves as a foil for her misdirected passion.  Dipak sidesteps Gita’s advances but is all the same smitten by the allure of something much larger than himself.  The loss of her son, the failure to please Dipak forever, as well as her fascination of and jealousy for Gita all combine to plunge Saraswati into a depression that threatens her sanity. Saraswati decides to act. She goes back to the shrine of the goddess at the riverbank, where it all began. Her communion with the goddess compels her to return to Gita, for the higher good, for herself and her husband, in spite of her baser feelings for Gita.  When Gita learns that Dipak approves of his wife seeking her healing, she feels redeemed. She prays to the goddess to grant her the powers to heal this time. For lately, she has been experiencing lapses to this God-given faculty, reminding us of her attendant’s warnings.  The day for Saraswati’s ritual cure falls on an important religious festival, when devotees pull around a gigantic wooden chariot with the gods inside it, a time of great festivity marked by an extreme collective frenzy. The healing is proceeding smoothly when something snaps. Suddenly the jhankrini and the patient are locked in a fierce tussle, as each one screams to onlookers that the other is bewitched, carrying the “bokshi”, as it is said.  The jhankrini beats Saraswati with the fearsome instruments reserved for driving out the “bokshi”, Saraswati with her hands and teeth in desperate defence of her life, while the intoxicated devotees beat drums in echo of the ritual frenzy outside. From such a finale - perhaps not of entirely human energies - only one emerges triumphant, but in the eerily quiet aftermath of the frenzied festival, we are left disturbed and unsure of just who was the one bewitched.  
Manuelita (film)
 The story begins with an old bird named the Patriarch of the Birds (from ''[[Trapito (film)|Trapito]]''), who tells many other animals something that happened many years ago: The story of Manuela turtle.

The next day, however, she soon gets the message when she heard music coming from under the bridge where she was walking and listening to a bow (the representation of Edith Piaf) Manuela singing the song and so is Larguirucho and Dopie playing the bandoneon under a bridge. They are see each other again and the three travel home on plane with the money Manuela has. When she finally returned to Pehuajó, Manuela reunites with her family who are overjoyed to see her. When Manuela asked about Bartolito, they tell her that Bartolito is now the master of the school, following after his mother's retirement, much to Manuela's happiness. She goes to school, after it ended with same kids they were if when they were kids(possibly their kids since it has been years and they had to get older to be parents) and finds Bartolito drawing two hearts, one above the other.

While Charlie is consistently loved and respected by his "sons", he is continually abused by the rest of the town, who see him as a stupid coward whom anyone can easily walk over. As a result of years of such treatment, Charlie develops a [[Dissociative identity disorder|split personality]] named Hank to deal with the confrontations Charlie avoids. Emerging whenever Charlie is under extreme stress, Hank is an over-the-top, rude, and violent persona reminiscent of characters played by [[Clint Eastwood]].<ref></ref> A [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] prescribes medication to keep Charlie's Hank personality at bay.  Believing that Charlie needs a vacation, his commanding officer ([[Robert Forster]]) orders him to escort Irene Waters ([[Renée Zellweger]]) from Rhode Island to [[Massena (town), New York|Massena, New York]], because she reportedly committed a [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit-and-run]]. Irene insists the hit-and-run accusation is a lie told by Dickie ([[Daniel Greene (actor)|Daniel Greene]]), her mob-connected ex-boyfriend, and by corrupt police officers in his employ, to keep her from revealing Dickie's illegal activities to the proper authorities. In Massena, Charlie prepares to turn over Irene to two [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) agents, when a [[hitman]] with a contract on Irene's life attempts to assassinate her, killing one of the EPA agents. Charlie keeps Irene safe, and they flee, accidentally leaving his medication behind, allowing the Hank personality to emerge frequently.

In the confusion, they are almost ambushed by Boshane and Gerke, but Charlie's sons, having found them, create a distraction, stealing a police helicopter, they call in a false report, stating Charlie and Irene have been spotted in the woods nearby, allowing Charlie and Irene to leave without knowing about the police who had left before they exited their room, leaving Casper behind.  They board a train back to Rhode Island. Dickie boards the same train, unable to rely on his henchmen to stop Charlie and Irene. He kidnaps her, and Charlie gives chase, working together with Hank to save her. Hank then appears to try to stop Charlie from rescuing her, but Charlie finally stands up for himself against his own fears, thus permanently nullifying Hank for good.  As Charlie tries to wrestle her back and disarm Dickie on a bridge, Dickie shoots off his thumb. Dickie is then hit from behind by a lawn dart thrown by Casper, killing him. Charlie and Irene fall from the bridge into a river below, where Charlie's sons arrive to help rescue them. Regrouping with Casper, Charlie apologizes for making him kill again, but Casper reveals he made up his backstory due to the fact that Charlie talked too much at the motel and scared him. The police arrive but quickly learn of Irene's plight and the corrupt cops working for Dickie. Gerke is arrested, Charlie is congratulated for bringing him to justice, and Irene is cleared of the charges against her.

He intends to propose to his girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), but his plan is disrupted when he and Pam are invited to the wedding of Pam's sister, Debbie ([[Nicole DeHuff]]), at Pam's parents' house on [[Long Island]]. Greg decides to propose to Pam in front of her family but this plan is put on hold when the airline company loses his luggage which contains the engagement ring.  At the Byrnes family home, Greg meets Pam's father Jack (Robert De Niro), mother Dina (Blythe Danner) and their beloved cat Mr. Jinx. Jack takes an instant dislike towards Greg and openly criticizes Greg for his choice of career as a male nurse and anything else he sees as a difference between Greg and the Byrnes family. Greg tries to impress Jack but his efforts fail. Greg becomes even more uncomfortable after he receives an impromptu [[Polygraph|lie detector]] test from Jack and later learns from Pam that her father is a retired [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative.    Meeting the rest of Pam's family and friends, Greg still feels like an outsider. Despite efforts to impress the family, Greg's inadvertent actions make him an easy target for ridicule and anger. During a volleyball game he causes Debbie a broken nose and a black eye, uses a malfunctioning toilet which floods the Byrnes' back yard with sewage, sets on fire the wedding altar, and several misunderstandings cause Jack to believe Greg is a [[marijuana]] user. Later, Greg loses Jinx and replaces him with a stray whose tail he spray paints to make him look like Mr. Jinx.   By now, the entire Byrnes family, including Pam, agrees that it is best for Greg to leave Long Island until the wedding concludes. Unwillingly, Greg goes to the airport where he is detained by airport security for insisting that his bag stay with him rather than be checked. Back at the Byrnes household, Jack tries to convince Pam that Greg was lying to her about everything. He claims to be unable to find proof of anyone named "Greg Focker" ever taking the [[Medical College Admission Test]] which Greg claimed he had passed with the initial intention of becoming a doctor. Upon learning that Greg's real first name is Gaylord, and being presented with proof from Pam that he did in fact pass the test, Jack rushes to the airport, convinces airport security to release Greg and brings him back to the Byrnes household.  As Greg is proposing to Pam, Jack and Dina listen in on their conversation from another room, agreeing that they should now meet Greg's parents. After Debbie's wedding, Jack views footage of Greg recorded by hidden cameras that he had placed strategically around the house.  
Men of Honor
 [[Carl Brashear]] leaves his native Kentucky and the life of a [[sharecropper]] in 1948 by joining the [[United States Navy]]. As a crew member of the salvage ship [[USS Hoist (ARS-40)|USS ''Hoist'']], where he is assigned to the galley, he is inspired by the bravery of one of the divers, [[Master Chief Petty Officer]] Leslie William "Billy" Sunday. He is determined to overcome racism and become the first black American Navy diver, even proclaiming that he will become a [[Master Diver (United States Navy)|master diver]]. He eventually is selected to attend Diving and Salvage School in Bayonne, New Jersey, where he arrives as a [[Boatswain's mate (United States Navy)|boatswain's mate second class]]. He finds that Master Chief Sunday is the leading chief petty officer and head instructor, who is under orders from the school's eccentric, bigoted commanding officer to ensure that Brashear fails.  Brashear struggles to overcome his educational shortcomings, a result of his leaving school in the grade 7 in order to work on his family's failing farm. He receives educational assistance from his future wife, a medical student who works part-time in the New York Public Library in Harlem. Brashear proves himself as a diver by rescuing a fellow student whose dive buddy abandons him during a salvage evaluation. Unfortunately, due to the racism of the commanding officer, the student who fled in the face of danger is awarded a medal for Brashear's heroic actions. Likewise, during an underwater assembling task where each student has to assemble a flange underwater using a bag of tools, Brashear's bag is cut open on purpose. Brashear nevertheless finishes the assembly and graduates from diving school, earning the quiet and suppressed admiration of Sunday and his fellow divers. Sunday is later demoted to senior chief by the commanding officer for standing up for Brashear and allowing him to pass.  The paths and careers of Brashear and Sunday diverge. Brashear rises quickly through the ranks, even becoming a national hero in the [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash|1966 Palomares incident]] for recovering a missing atomic bomb and for saving the life of Navy crew. Sunday continually loses his composure around officers who disrespect his accomplishments, until he is finally demoted to [[chief petty officer]] and relegated to menial duties.  He becomes a brooding alcoholic displeased with his lowered rank.  The two eventually meet again after Brashear's left leg was so mangled in the Palomares incident that he feels that his only chance to return to active duty and a relatively normal life is for it to be amputated and replaced with a prosthesis. Until this time, no Navy man had ever returned to full active duty with a prosthetic limb.  Sunday again trains Brashear and aids him in his fight against the Navy's bureaucracy and an antagonistic Navy captain (Brashear's and Sunday's former ''Hoist'' [[executive officer]]) in order to return to full active duty and fulfill his dream of becoming a master diver. They succeed in getting Brashear reinstated.  In the epilogue, it is noted that two years later Brashear becomes a master diver. It is added that he does not retire from the Navy for another nine years.  
Memento (film)
 The film starts with the [[Instant film|Polaroid]] photograph of a dead man. As the sequence plays backwards the photo reverts to its undeveloped state, entering the camera before the man is shot in the head. The film then continues, alternating between [[black and white]] and color sequences.  The black and white sequences begin with Leonard Shelby, an insurance investigator, in a motel room speaking to an unseen and unknown caller. Leonard has [[anterograde amnesia]] and is unable to store recent memories, the result of an attack by two men. Leonard explains that he killed the attacker who raped and strangled his wife, but a second clubbed him and escaped. The police did not accept that there was a second attacker, but Leonard believes the attacker's name is John or James, with a last name starting with G. So, Leonard conducts his own investigation using a convoluted system of notes, Polaroid photos, and tattoos. From his occupation in the insurance industry, Leonard recalls a fellow anterograde amnesiac, Sammy Jankis. Sammy's diabetic wife, who wasn't sure if his condition was genuine, repeatedly requested Sammy's assistance with her insulin shots; she hoped he would remember having already given her an injection and would stop himself from giving her another before she died of an overdose. However, Sammy continues to administer the injections, and his wife falls into a fatal coma.  The color sequences are shown reverse-chronologically. In the story's chronology, Leonard self-directively gets a tattoo of John G's [[Vehicle registration plate|license plate]]. Finding a note in his clothes, he meets Natalie, a bartender who resents Leonard because he wears the clothes and drives the car of her boyfriend, Jimmy Grantz. After understanding Leonard's condition, she uses it to get Leonard to drive a man named Dodd out of town and offers to run the license plate as a favor. Meanwhile, Leonard meets with a contact, Teddy, who helps with Dodd, but warns about Natalie. However, a photograph causes Leonard not to trust Teddy. Natalie provides Leonard with the driver's license for a John Edward Gammell, Teddy's full name. Confirming Leonard's information on "John G" and his warnings, Leonard drives Teddy to an abandoned building, leading to the opening, where he shoots him.  In the final black-and-white sequence, prompted by the caller, Leonard meets with Teddy, an undercover officer, who has found Leonard's "John G," Jimmy, and directs Leonard to the abandoned building. When Jimmy arrives, Leonard strangles him fatally and takes a Polaroid photo of the body. As the photo develops, the black-and-white transitions to the final color sequence. Leonard swaps clothes with Jimmy, hearing him whisper "Sammy." As Leonard has only told Sammy's story to those he has met, he suddenly doubts Jimmy's role. Teddy arrives and asserts that Jimmy was John G, but when Leonard is undeterred, Teddy reveals that he helped him kill the real attacker a year ago, and he has been using Leonard ever since. Teddy points out that since the name "John G" is common, Leonard will cyclically forget and begin again and that even Teddy himself has a "John G" name. Further, Teddy claims that Sammy's story is Leonard's own story, a memory Leonard has repressed to escape guilt.  After hearing Teddy's exposition, Leonard consciously burns Jimmy's photograph, writes a message to himself on Teddy's photograph that he should not trust Teddy, and drives off in Jimmy's car. He then has Teddy's license plate number tattooed on himself, as if Teddy were the second attacker, leading to Teddy's eventual death.

Mehndi Waley Hath
 The film begins with a voice over explaining the "cause" of the filmmakers in attempting to expose a "crual custom"(as the poster said) that exists in the rural areas of the Punjab where women are married off (illegally) to the Quran so that the landowning family doesn't have to part with any of its wealth. The action is based around the rural haveli of Vadda Saeen - the family elder, and his wife. They live in their sprawling estate together with the extended family that is usually warring with one another. There are also legions of slaves (ghulams) who devote themselves to the Vadda Saeen and show their love for their Saeen by kissing and nuzzling his feet!  The house contains two warring "bahu's", the benign, kindhearted widow [[Naghma]] and the Wicked-Super-Dyke-from-Hell Bahar. Naghma has a demented son, Babar Ali who shoots people for fun and a daughter, [[Saima Noor|Saima]], an overgrown 35-year-old teenager with an unhealthy pigeon fetish. Problems arise when it is discovered that the family will stand to lose a large segment of their land once Saima is wedded. The family elders, cajoled and abetted by Eyebrow Queen Bahar decide to adopt a plan where Saima is to get married, not to a handsome young prince but to the Holy Book. There are to be no festivities, no joy and little chance of children. Not only that, but she is to wear only white and must live with her husband in a deserted mausoleum! Naturally Saima, expecting marriage to a handsome young pigeon is rather depressed when she is banished to a life on the periphery. Matters start coming to a head when Rana returns from "frontline duty" to find that the girl of his dreams has been forced to wed the Quran and live in exile. He consults a nearby imam who tells him that such marriages are unrecognized by Islam and are simply an illegal schemes by which families attempt to retain their wealth. So, armed with this information, the hitherto timid Rana decides to take on the almighty family of Vadda Saeen, led by the dangerously psychotic [[Babar Ali]].  First off, the movie must be commended for at least making an attempt to tackle a relevant issue in a language most likely to be understood by the masses. The film is also to be commended for avoiding the sleazy element associated with Punjabi movies. [[Syed Noor]] plays to the masses but avoids the smutty element quite successfully going for the wholesome style of "[[Choorian (1998 film)|Choorian]]" instead. The film has some fairly decent tunes to help it along, but the pace starts slowing more and more as we approach the inevitable climax. Saima looks fetching and should be featuring in next years Film Award ceremonies for her acting in this film - yet she looks considerably older than her co-star [[Moammar Rana]]. Bahar eats up the screen and dominates as only she can while [[Nirma]], as [[Babar Ali]]'s trinket doesn't make much impression despite being given a sizzling number to perform. [[Nirma]]'s future doesn't appear to be too bright.  Babar Ali ends up taking most of the acting accolades delivering a menacing performance as the evil brother Mattoo. He ought to forget about taking on romantic leads considering how average (to put it mildly) he looks and would be far better advised to stick to this sort of negative role, which he performed with such distinction here. Mehndi Waley Hath is at least not an outright embarrassment and is somewhat elevated by the "message" that it attempts to deliver. A feather in director/producer/screenwriter [[Syed Noor]]'s cap - a rare commodity these days.  
Mercy (2000 film)
 [[Detective]] Cathy Palmer ([[Ellen Barkin]]) is on the trail of an elusive [[serial killer]].

Mexico City (film)
  The movie begins by showing how the Mexican president's doctor is kidnapped and finally murdered.  The reason given is for his opposing political party trying to embarrass him.  Mitch Cobb and her brother, Sam, are on their way to Oaxaca to do some exploring.  Mitch is not happy in Mexico City; we see in a flash-back why she is with her brother.  Here, Mitch confides with Sam the truth about why she is divorced and how her two children were killed in a car wreck.  Mitch hates the city and just wants to go back to the Hotel Majestic, near the Zocalo, and sleep until they fly down to Oaxaca the next day.  Sam leaves her at the hotel and decides to go visit some bars and drink a little before going to bed.  The next morning he has not come back to the hotel.  She begins a frantic search. Nobody will help her except Pedro, a taxi driver, who offers to help her look for $100 a day.  They finally find the bar where Sam had gone; eventually they even meet his killer, a drug lord, who still has his orange baseball cap and camera.  When the US embassy finds out about his camera with film in it, they suddenly take a personal interest in Mitch and now try to be nice to her.  The reason is that the president's doctor was murdered behind the same bar where Sam met his murderers, and on the same night.  They suspect that he may have photographed the murder scene.  He had done just that, and the photographs were strong evidence of the truth.  But now Mitch's life is in danger too, because the evil doers want her dead and the pictures.  Pedro volunteers to drive her to the Texas border so she will be safe.  At 10 kilometers from the border and Mexico City police car stops them.  In the ugly exchange that follows Mitch shoots the officer.  As she walks across the border she is arrested for that murder. She is forgiven when the photos are finally given to the Mexican president. In an epilogue scene at the end of the movie, she has taken Pedro's advice to start another family; she became a mother to Sam's orphan son; she had found happiness again.<ref name="allmovie"></ref>

Miss Congeniality (film)
 In 1982, a very young Gracie Hart steps into a playground fight to beat up a bully who is threatening a boy she likes. However, the boy feels humiliated at being rescued "by a girl", and rejects her rudely, whereupon she punches him in the nose and leaves to sulk alone. Years later, Gracie is now a tough [[Special Agent]] for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. During a sting operation against Russian mobsters, she disobeys her superior's orders in order to save a mob boss who appears to be choking, which causes one of the other agents to be shot. She is demoted to a desk job as punishment.  Soon after, the agency is alerted, via a letter from the notorious [[domestic terrorist]] known only as "The Citizen", to a bomb threat at the upcoming 75th annual Miss United States beauty pageant in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]]. Gracie's partner Eric Matthews is put in charge, and he relies on Gracie's suggestions, but he takes credit for them himself. One of Gracie's ideas is to plant an agent [[undercover]] at the event. Eric then suggests that Gracie take on that role, replacing Miss [[New Jersey]], who was just disqualified. Beauty pageant coach Victor Melling teaches Gracie how to dress, walk, and behave like a contestant. Though initially appalled, she comes to appreciate Victor's thoroughness. Gracie enters the pageant as "Gracie Lou Freebush", representing New Jersey, and becomes friends with Cheryl Frasier, who is Miss Rhode Island. As the competition begins, Gracie impresses the judges during the talent competition with her [[glass harp]] skills and [[self-defense]] techniques.   Several suspects are identified, including the current competition director and former pageant winner Kathy Morningside, her assistant Frank Tobin, the veteran [[MC]] Stan Fields, and Cheryl, who has a history of being a radical [[Animal rights|animal rights activist]]. Gracie accompanies Cheryl and other contestants as they spend a night partying, where Gracie tries to dig into Cheryl's past, but inadvertently learns from the others that Kathy's past as a pageant contestant is suspect, including the fact that she won after the leading contestant suddenly came down with food poisoning. Gracie comes to believe Kathy is a "Citizen" copycat. However, when Gracie reports this to Eric and the team, she learns that "The Citizen" has been arrested on an unrelated charge, and because there is no further threat, their supervisor has pulled the mission. Gracie insists that she suspects something is wrong, and Eric returns to Texas to help her continue the investigation against orders.  In the final round, Gracie is stunned when she is named first runner up. Cheryl is named Miss United States, but as she goes to accept the [[tiara]], Gracie realizes that Frank, who is actually Kathy's son, impersonated "The Citizen" to make the pageant bomb threat. Suspecting foul play, she stops the crowning ceremony in time, and the tiara, rigged with a bomb, explodes in the stage scenery. As Kathy and Frank are arrested, Gracie determines that the two wanted to kill the pageant winner on stage as revenge for Kathy's termination from the Miss United States organization. As the event closes down and Gracie and Eric prepare to return to headquarters with a newfound interest in each other, the other contestants name Gracie as "Miss Congeniality".  
Mission: Impossible 2
  Bio-chemical expert Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich sends a message to the [[Impossible Missions Force|IMF]] for [[Ethan Hunt]], an old friend of his, warning that his employer, Biocyte Pharmaceuticals, forced him to develop a biological epidemic to profit from its remedy. He arranges to meet with Ethan to deliver the [[Chimera (virus)|Chimera]] virus, and its cure, [[Bellerophon]]. With Ethan on vacation and incommunicado, the IMF sends agent Sean Ambrose disguised as Ethan to meet Nekhorvich on a passenger plane. Ambrose goes rogue, killing Nekhorvich and stealing Bellerophon before his men destroy the plane.  IMF Commander Swanbeck informs Ethan of the circumstances of Nekhorvich's death and they determine Ambrose is responsible. Swanbeck tasks Ethan with recovering the virus and its cure, and has him recruit Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief presently operating in [[Seville]], [[Spain]]. After recruiting Nyah and romancing her, Ethan finds out that she is Ambrose's ex-girlfriend and he reluctantly convinces her to [[spy]] on Ambrose.  Ethan assembles his team, computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Billy Baird, in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], where Biocyte laboratories are located and Ambrose is staying. As Ethan stakes out Biocyte, Nyah rekindles her former relationship with Ambrose and relays information to Ethan's team. At a horse racing event, Ambrose meets with Biocyte's CEO, John C. McCloy. He shows McCloy a memory card video of Chimera affecting one of Nekhorvich's colleagues before blackmailing McCloy into cooperating with him. Nyah steals the camera's memory card and delivers it to Ethan. They learn that Chimera has a 20-hour dormant period before it causes death by mass destruction of the victim's [[red blood cell]]s. Bellerophon can only save the victim if used within that 20-hour window. When Nyah discreetly returns the memory card to Ambrose, he notices it is in the wrong pocket of his jacket.  Ethan's team kidnaps McCloy to force him to give up Bellerophon. However, the only Bellerophon samples were taken by Nekhorvich, and are now in Ambrose's hands. Ambrose has the cure, but does not have the virus; unbeknownst to him at the time, Nekhorvich injected himself with Chimera to smuggle it out of Biocyte. Ambrose plans to exchange a sample of Bellerophon to McCloy for a sample of Chimera. Ethan's team breaks into Biocyte to destroy the virus before the exchange can take place. Ambrose, posing as Ethan, tricks Nyah into revealing the plan, then captures Nyah and raids Biocyte to secure the virus. Ethan is able to destroy all but one sample of Chimera before Ambrose intervenes, and a firefight ensues, culminating in the sample being dropped on the floor between Ambrose and Ethan. Ambrose orders Nyah to retrieve the sample; she instead injects herself with it, preventing Ambrose from simply killing her after she retrieved it for him. Nyah insists that Ethan kill her to destroy the virus but Ethan is unwilling to do so. Ambrose takes Nyah away as Ethan escapes from the laboratory.  Ambrose releases Nyah to wander the streets of Sydney in a daze, intending to start a pandemic. He offers to sell Bellerophon to McCloy in exchange for stock options, to make him Biocyte's majority shareholder. He predicts that the price of Biocyte's stock will skyrocket due to demand for Bellerophon after the Chimera outbreak. Ethan infiltrates the meeting and steals the remaining samples of Bellerophon. While Ethan is pursued by Ambrose and his men, Luther and Billy locate Nyah, who has wandered to a cliff side, intent on killing herself to prevent the eventual outbreak. Ethan kills Ambrose's men but Ambrose chases him to a beach where Ethan defeats him in a melee brawl. Wth little time left on the 20-hour countdown, Luther reaches Ethan at the beach. As Ethan is about to give Luther the Bellerophon canister, Ambrose recovers and points a gun at Ethan. Ethan throws the canister to Luther and jumps away from Ambrose's shot while kicking up a gun from the sand which he uses to kill Ambrose. Luther injects Nyah with the Bellerophon in time to cure her.  IMF clears Nyah's criminal record and Ethan starts his vacation with her in Sydney.  
Mission to Mars
 In 2020, the ''Mars I'' spacecraft to planet [[Mars]], is commanded by Luke Graham ([[Don Cheadle]]) with fellow astronauts Nicholas Willis ([[Kavan Smith]]), Sergei Kirov ([[Peter Outerbridge]]), and Renée Coté ([[Jill Teed]]). Upon arrival, the team discovers a [[crystalline]] formation in the [[Cydonia (region of Mars)|Cydonia region]], which they suspect is an [[extrusion]] from a subsurface [[geothermal]] column of water, useful to future human colonization. After reporting this to the World Space Station, they investigate the formation and hear a strange sound on their communications system, which they assume to be interference from their planetary [[Rover (space exploration)|rover]]. When they scan the formation with radar, a large [[vortex]] kills everyone except Luke. After the vortex subsides, the formation is revealed to be part of a large [[Face on Mars|humanoid face]].  The World Space Station having received Luke's distress message, readies a second ship for a rescue mission—the ''Mars II'' containing Commander Woody Blake ([[Tim Robbins]]), Co-Commander Jim McConnell ([[Gary Sinise]]), and mission specialists Terri Fisher ([[Connie Nielsen]]) and Phil Ohlmyer ([[Jerry O'Connell]]). As the ship enters Mars orbit, [[micrometeoroid]]s breach the hull. During repair, the external fuel tanks are overlooked, causing a leak and later explosion when the now-frozen fuel drifts into position behind the rockets just as they are fired. The crew abandon ship to get to the REMO ("Resupply Module") orbiting Mars. Tethered to the others, Woody launches himself at the module, but although he attaches a line to get the others to the module, he is unable to properly land on it. Terri tries to rescue Woody, who is her husband, but, knowing she would run out of fuel before reaching him, Woody removes his helmet, killing himself to save her.  When the survivors arrive on the surface of Mars, they find Luke living on the produce of a [[greenhouse]], whereupon he reveals the crystalline face structure to them, and that the sound on the communications system comes from the structure and represents an [[Euler angles|XYZ coordinates]] map of human-like [[DNA]], but missing a pair of chromosomes. Jim determines they must complete the sequence to pass a test, and the crew dispatches a robotic rover to reproduce the completed signal. Following the transmission, an opening appears in the side of the structure, which Jim, Terri, and Luke enter, while Phil remains at the repaired Earth return vehicle with orders to launch, with or without them, at the agreed time.  The opening seals behind them, disrupting radio communication with Phil, and a three-dimensional projection of the solar system depicts the planet Mars, covered with water, being struck by a large asteroid and rendered uninhabitable. A recreation of a Martian then reveals that the natives of Mars evacuated their world in spacecraft, one of which landed on Earth to create the planet's lifeforms and human beings, who could one day land on Mars and be recognized as descendants. An invitation is offered for one astronaut to follow the Martians to their new home. Jim accepts the invitation, bidding farewell to Terri and Luke, and while they return to Phil and subsequently to Earth, he is taken into an oxygenated capsule in a small ship that is launched past the three astronauts leaving Mars, who watch it fly toward the Martians' home.

Mission Kashmir
 Inayat Khan is the Senior [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] of Police responsible for the security of Srinagar, [[Kashmir]]. One day, his young son Irfaan met an accident and is taken to a hospital, but due to a [[fatwa]] instigated by the leader of a terrorist group forbidding doctors to treat policemen and their families, the doctors refuse to treat Irfaan. Irfaan succumbs to his injuries. As revenge, Inayat Khan and his men manage to attack and kill all the terrorists hiding in the village of Dalgate.  A family caught in the crossfire is being killed by accident. A young boy named Altaaf is the only family member who survives the shooting as he is severely traumatized by his parents and sister's deaths and haunted by the memory of the masked policeman (who is Khan himself) before falling unconscious. Khan's wife Neelima, feeling sorry for Altaaf, attempts to persuade Khan to adopt Altaaf. Despite fearing that Altaaf may one day discover the truth and get revenge for it, Khan reluctantly agrees as he is wracked with remorse for killing Altaaf's family.  Just when Altaaf seemed to have settled down in his new home and accepted Khan and Neelima as his new parents, he finds Khan's mask and realizes that Khan was one of the policemen who killed his family. After an unsuccessful attempt on Khan's life, the young Altaaf runs away and is found and brought up by a terrorist group led by their Pathan leader Hilal Kohistani, who [[brainwash]]es him into thinking that he and his men act according to Islamic principles and trains him to become a terrorist.   Ten years later, Hilal and an adult Altaaf are assigned the task of completing "Mission Kashmir", a plan of an unnamed terrorist sponsor that involves &mdash; or so Altaaf is told &mdash; killing the Indian Prime Minister. Hilal uses Altaaf's hatred as a means to achieve his own goals while encouraging the latter to target Khan, who is now an Inspector General, for his family's death. Altaaf visits his childhood friend and television personality Sufiya Parvez and, though he falls in love with her, uses her to try and make Hilal's plan of blowing up the local TV tower of Srinagar on Khan's birthday successful. He makes another unsuccessful attempt on Khan's life, which resulted him to be branded as a wanted criminal by the media and a fallout between Khan and Neelima.  At the same time, Sufiya learns of Altaaf's true occupation and breaks off her relationship with him. On the same date that Atlaaf's family was murdered, Altaaf makes another attempt on Khan by having three of Hilal's men plant a bomb in Khan's briefcase. Unfortunately, Neelima falls victim to it by accident, much to the complete distraught of both Khan and Altaaf, with the former having lost his chance to apologize for his argument with her and the latter screaming in remorseful agony for killing her.  Eventually, Khan manages to invade one of the terrorists' hideouts and discovers evidence and information about Mission Kashmir after capturing the bomb-briefcase men. After going through some cassette tapes with the help of Sufiya, Khan realized that the true goal of Mission Kashmir is to launch missiles on the local places of Hindu and Muslim worship to escalate Hindu-Muslim conflict across the subcontinent, thereby dividing Kashmir and turning it into a war zone. It also turns out that the attack on the TV tower was planned by Hilal to spread the rumor of assassinating the Prime Minister to cover up the true plot. Khan also realized that Hilal deliberately kept the true plot of Mission Kashmir as a secret from Altaaf for he feared that Altaaf would not support it; this was evident when Atlaaf leaves to the swampy hideouts to prepare for the launches, Hilal secretly tells one of his men to keep an eye on Atlaaf and kill him if he doesn't consent over the true targets.  By staging a fire in the jail that allows one of the bomb-briefcase men to escape, Khan and his men manage to track down and capture Hilal. Khan offers to make a deal with Hilal: going under the false pretense of allowing Hilal and his men to continue forward with Mission Kashmir in exchange for killing Altaaf to avenge Neelima's death. Seeing that Khan's 'hatred' of Altaaf is worthy of a Pathan's duty, Hilal accepts the deal, and to ensure no other mistake will be made, Khan goes alone with Hilal to the hideouts.  As Hilal and Khan reach the hideouts, Hilal tells Altaaf of Khan's whereabouts. An enraged Altaaf starts beating up a weary Khan, but the latter reveals to him the true goals of Mission Kashmir, stating that Kashmir will be turned into a hell if he lets Hilal destroy the holy shrines. Hilal orders Altaaf to shoot Khan, who is willing to accept his fate after expressing his dear love for Altaaf and remorse for killing his family.   As Altaaf struggles to do it, he remembers that Neelima took him to the shrines and the comment Neelima said about choosing sides during her visit earlier. Unwilling to betray his mother, Atlaaf decides to put his plan of revenge aside and aids Khan in stopping Hilal and his men from targeting the holy shrines. However, Hilal throws a bomb to distract them before getting shot to death by Altaaf, giving Hilal's men a chance to prepare to blow up the shrines.   While Khan shoots down several terrorists, Altaaf redeems himself by taking possession of a missile launcher and using it to destroy the other launchers and kill the remaining terrorists, thus saving the shrines. However, Altaaf gets shot in the torso and falls into the swamps. Khan jumps in and rescues the unconscious Altaaf by bringing him to shore, evading the explosion of the hideouts caused by Altaaf's act of redemption.  The plans of Mission Kashmir are revealed to the public by the media, and the terrorist sponsor's hideout is found by Kashmiri police, who shoot the sponsor as he tries to get away after killing two of his associates. Altaaf wakes up from a pleasant dream, where he reconciles with Sufiya and forgives Khan, accepting the latter as his father again after 10 years.

Mohabbatein
  Narayan Shankar ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) is a strict Headmaster of Gurukul Boys, a prestigious all-boys university. Narayan wants the best out of his students by placing astronomical emphasis on traditions and discipline only with no room for anything else such as camaredrie, liberties, drama etc. For example; as Principal Head of Gurukul for  over twenty five years, he had forbidden his students from any kind of romance &mdash; anyone he catches romancing or in love is expelled with no "ifs" , "ands" or "buts"....  This film focuses particularly on three of the school's students: Sameer ([[Jugal Hansraj]]), Vicky ([[Uday Chopra]]) and Karan ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) who all fall in love.  1.Sameer is head over heels in love with Sanjana ([[Kim Sharma]]), his childhood friend who already has a steady boyfriend.  2.Vicky falls for Ishika ([[Shamita Shetty]]), a student at the all-girls university near to Gurukul Boys  who is irritated by Vicky every time he comes near her to woo her.  3.Karan has a crush /becomes smitten with Kiran ([[Preeti Jhangiani]]), a girl he sees one night alone at a train station who is a widow (already married to a famous pilot who is  presumed to be dead).  All three know that if they're caught they'd be expelled, so they do not pursue their love interests but do remininsce about it in ther free time.  Next, comes Mr. Raj Aryan ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) who is welcomed in Gurukul Boys Music College as a Music teacher. Friendly, amicable, and a strong believer in the power of LOVE (especially romantic love) he manages to challenge the [[status quo]]. Gradually, he introduces changes that the Principal Narayan dislikes when confronted with them.  For example,  when the three boys open up to him about their love interests, he encourages them to "'''follow the heart'''" and not be disheartened so very easily. He inspires them by telling them that he also has  his special love, Megha ([[Aishwarya Rai]]) who is dead, but he continues to love her and imagines that she is still by his side now. Raj encourages the boys to continue to stay loyal to their loves.  One day Raj throws a party inside the  Gurukul campus, inviting the students from the nearby girls' school  as part of his plan to spread the message of love in Gurukul.  Narayan is furious and threatens to fire him. At this point, Raj  reveals to Narayan that he was a student at Gurukul Boys about 10– 15 years  ago and he had fallen in love with Megha, Narayan's one and only daughter. Narayan had expelled Raj without ever seeing his face, and immediately Megha had committed suicide. Raj explains to the Principal Narayan his reason to return to Gurukul Boys as a Music teacher - "the hope of changing Gurukul Boys College philosophy and creed on "Zero-tolerance for LOVE" thus, honoring his love for Megha.  Raj challenges, dares and also promises a shocked Narayan that before he leaves Gurukul Boys College, he will fill it with so much love that even Narayan will not be able to remove it. Narayan accepts this challenge, and allows Raj to continue as a teacher for a while longer.  Subsequently, with Raj's guidance and support the boys -Sameer, Vicky, and Karan -one by one, slowly slowly are able to win over their love interests...  Narayan retaliates by tightening the rules of Gurukul Boys College. The students body continue to defy and challenge the rules, form new ones and encourage new ideas which is very encouraging and spreads an atmosphere of happiness.  As a last resort to preserve the ethos and creed which he had built for twenty five years for Gurukul College- Narayan decides to expel the three students Sameer, Vicky and Karan.  The Music teacher Raj speaks up and pleads on their behalf, explaining to the Principal Narayan how  he had instigated the death of his own daughter, and the boys should not be punished as they did not do anything "wrong".  Raj also states that he feels Narayan lost the challenge, because his daughter left him and now Raj (who considered Narayan an elder) is leaving him. Raj's stinging words make Narayan realise that changes are needed. He publicly apologises to the students and steps down as the Principal, allowing Raj to take over as the new Headmaster!  In a few years time, Gurukul  Boys College changes into a university that had an atmosphere  honor and discipline mixed with flexibility,love and happiness which was evident on each student's rapport and demeanor.  In the last scene- Raj, Narayan and a vague vision of the late Megha walk hand in hand happily together towards the wide open and strong gates of Gurukul Boys College.

Monarch (film)
 ''Monarch''  is part fact, part fiction and unfolds around one night in the life of a hated king susceptible to assassination, and paranoid with the thought of his own mortality. The film is set in just one night when the injured Henry VIII arrives at a manor house closed for the season. Henry is without the power of his throne. He is vulnerable to those around him and to his own mental issues. He had left England financially and morally bankrupt; his collection of enemies became his only constant. In an interview John Walsh said “Often you can find out more about someone in a small time frame rather than you can if the two-hour film spans their whole life. Most bio-pics become little more than a montage of facts. If you confine a character to that time frame you can find out more about them.”<ref>http://irishpost.co.uk/london-irish-director-reveals-archive-henry-viii-film-tapes-almost-lost/#comment-364005</ref>

Munnudi
 Day-to-day practice of any religion goes as per the customs evolved through i find instances of "intelligent" interpretations of these very tenets by unscrupulous people to serve their own interests. One such instance is the exploitation of woman for the sheer thrill of man in a male dominated society taking advantage of the ‘custom’ of ‘marriage’ particularly when the woman is struck by ignorance, fear and poverty.  "Munnudi" is a preface written by the waves of Arabian Sea on the plank of the sand. An untold pain of a woman in a pictorial parody, a mirror to an open mind.  In Sheriah (Islamic Law) prostitution is deliberated as the worst crime on earth, which solicits heavy punishment to the culprit’s life after death. "Munnudi" makes an attempt to discuss the misuse of ‘Sheriah’ by certain canny men, who maintain that they could elude both ‘Crime’ and ‘Punishment’ for transgression on woman by sheltering themselves beneath the testaments on ‘Nikha’ and ‘Talaaq’.  Munnudi is the story of a mother of a teenaged girl who lived in a small village on the coast of Arabian Sea, who raised the first dissident cry against the barbarian act of man, the act that every folk was made to believe, that cherished the sanctity of the Holy Book. ‘Munnudi’ is the story of the first woman who burnt her silence against this ritual, wherein every woman of the village was to go to bed as temporary wife with a new alien annually, decorating herself in trousseau.  Munnudi deals with this kind of gender discrimination – a crime perpetrated by man against woman in the guise of ‘marriage’.  The story goes like this. Mutthuchera, a tiny seaside village, has a special attraction to Arabian traders who have been regularly coming to this village. They come in a particular ‘season’ and stay on for about three months during which they settle contracts for buying wood, spices, etc. Local traders vie with each other to woo the Arabians to their side by providing them all comforts including ‘temporary wives’. For this, they have evolved an ingenious method. They induce poor local women to agree to a ‘system’ in which they marry the Arabians and live with them as their wives in nearby posh hotels. After about three months, it is time for the Arabians to go back. They give divorce (Talaaq) before leaving. These women return to their huts and wait in silence for the next ‘season’ to become ‘new wife’ for some ‘new’ Arabian husband.  These women get some good money as Meher, as a part of marriage custom every time they marry. There are other inducements as well, like visas for their kith and kin to go to Arab countries for work. There are agents who fix such marriages for a commission. Their trump card is knowledge of Arabic language. For ages, these women have accepted this system as a way of life. No one questions the ‘sanctity’ of such events as everything is done as per the ‘rules’ of marriage (Nikaah) and divorce (Talaq); ‘Meher’ and ‘Visa’ are anyway too tempting for a woman struggling for two meals.  As if by exception, an Arabian who marries Rukhiya develops true love for her. Rukhiya too loves him. He does not divorce her and promises to return soon to take her back with him. Rukhiya gets a daughter (Unnisa) through this marriage. Sixteen years pass by; the Arabian does not return. But Rukhiya’s love and hope are so strong that she continues to wait and wards off pressures and inducements for remarriage taking shelter under the fact that she is not divorced.  Meanwhile, sensing the concern of the local youth group, a ious religious leader explains the complexities involved in Nikaah and Talaaq and advises the group to deal with the situation as a social problem. This youth group becomes a stumbling block to the local trader and the agent. But the system has to go on, as otherwise the trader suffers! So, what was going on openly takes the form of secret marriages!!  As a part of his job, Hasanabba (the Agent) turns his attention to Rukhiya’s daughter. Rukhiya tries to avoid her daughter falling prey to such a system. She wants to marry her off to some local boy. But it proves impossible as no one is prepared to marry a girl whose paternity is not known – not even any member of the youth group!! This stark reality and the mounting pressures of the agent and the trader compel Rukhiya to painfully agree to such a ‘marriage’ for her daughter. But the sight of the corpse (floating in the river) of another girl recently married in such a manner unshackles her pent up anguish. She bursts into the trader’s mansion where the marriage proceedings are going on and stuns all the men folk by breaking the marriage of her daughter and vows to ensure that such a marriage will never take place in the village, thus taking a lead to walk away into freedom – freedom from fear and oppression.  This film is based on the short story ‘Mutthuchera’ by Boluwar Mohammad Kunhi, well known for pioneering the projection of various aspects of Muslim Life in Kannada Literature. Boluwar Mohammad Kunhi has won three Sahithya Academy Awards including Fellowship.  With this maiden directorial venture, P. Sheshadri, opens up a new avenue for fresh and sensitive subjects for films.

My Dog Skip (film)
 Willie Morris as an adult is looking back on his childhood in the early 1940s and how it was colored by his dearly beloved dog, a [[Jack Russell Terrier]] whom he had named Skip. In the beginning, Willie is a lonely 9-year old child with a gruff, proud father, a [[Spanish Civil War]] veteran, and a charismatic, talkative mother, a housewife, but he is an only child and small for his age with few friends. His one companion is a young man who lives next door, Dink Jenkins, who is the local sports hero in Mississippi. However, when Dink is drafted to go to war, Willie's mother decides to buy him a dog, against his father's wishes, in order that he should have some company.  Willie and Skip become firm friends very quickly. However, Willie gets bullied at school by Big Boy Wilkinson, Henjie Henick, and Spit McGee, until Dink sends him a German helmet and belt from the front line. The other boys demand he play ball in order to win back his belongings. Skip leaps in to help him. That same day, the three boys talk Willie into spending the night in a graveyard, where they claim a witch is buried. If he stays there, he gets to join their gang and also keep the ball Dink Jenkins signed for them, and if not, he has to give them his German helmet. Willie stays there for a number of hours, until he hears two moonshiners who are loading crates into a crypt. Skip jumps on Millard, one the moonshiners, until the second one, Junior, comes at him with a spade. Willie uses a slingshot to hit Junior in the nose with an acorn and attempts to escape the graveyard with Skip. They are soon captured by Junior. He tells Willie not to move before sunrise or he will kill Skip. Then the two men leave. The three boys return in the morning and accept Willie into their group for spending the night in the graveyard.  The narrator then goes on to explain various changes in his life. Skip, having always been a friendly dog, is known by everyone in the town, including black people, significant because Mississippi was still segregated at the time. Skip leads Willie through the best parts of his life; his boyhood days. Thanks to Skip, Willie now has three friends, and a girlfriend, Rivers.  Skip is there for him when Dink gets home, shell-shocked and a drunkard since dishonourably discharged from the army, presumably for desertion. However, when Willie’s first ball game comes along, Skip and Willie have their first falling out.   Dink promised to come along but does not bother. Since the war he has found competitions do not matter to him anymore, and Willie is so upset by this that his game is ruined. Skip, wanting to cheer him up, runs onto the field and sits wagging him tail, refusing to leave. Becoming increasingly frustrated, Willie hits him across the muzzle and he runs away.   After the game, a devastated and tearful Willie is unable to find his dog. Unbeknownst to him, Skip had returned to the crypt, and been accidentally shut in the grave where moonshine alcohol was being stored. Dink, however, after explaining that he had been scarred by having to kill in the war, tells Willie nothing is ever lost for good and goes out to help him find Skip. As Willie searches in the graveyard, he hears Skip's barks, and can see that Junior is about to strike Skip with a spade. He runs to save him, but there is a thump and a whimper.

Gates is in cahoots with a Las Vegas mobster, Tony Morano, who assures him that his armed henchman "Shuffles" will handle matters if Gates does not.  After another resident passes away, Gates attempts to take control of the deceased owner's land along with his two widows ([[Emmanuelle Vaugier]], Anita Brown) by calling in unpaid debts. Monte is reluctant to marry yet again until he sees these two women are extremely skilled in the kitchen, thus he ends up with several more acres of land and two more wives. Monte retires the debt of their first husband, thus once again thwarting Gates, who sought [[repossession]] of the mortgaged lands over repayment of the debt.  Gates, frustrated, has his associate Stewart try to catch Monte in the act of smoking or drinking to get him excommunicated from the church and kicked out of town. As a treat, Monte takes his wives for a honeymoon to Las Vegas, introducing them to gambling and other joys of the modern world like tennis and bikinis.  The ladies go to a women's equality seminar where the speaker, Dr. Van Dyke ([[Molly Shannon]]), preaches that women should dominate the relationship and be completely equal to their "lesser halves." The wives enter a strip club, one where men dance. Monte goes to retrieve them, where he ends up in the show.  After returning to Utah, the ladies take a more dominant role in the house and become less dependent. At the digging site for his new ski resort, Monte's crew discovers human bones and believes they have uncovered an ancient Native American burial ground.  Gates has a scheme to frame Monte for a [[counterfeit money]] operation. Monte goes to jail, and assistant Ray confirms they have indeed been building on an ancient burial site. At a town trial, Gates argues that Monte should be excommunicated. His wives and his lawyer/waiter Paul attest that Monte is a good man, but he is found guilty regardless.  Tony and his right-hand man Shuffles come into town and inform Gates that they have been sent by crime boss Don Giovanni to assassinate Monte. Gates gloats that he is of Native American descent, making him the rightful owner of the land, enabling him to turn the town into a gambling resort. Monte's wives drive a truck into the jail and break him out.  Monte races to the dig site where the police show up and Gates' plan is revealed. The police arrest Gates and Monte is free to go, but Don Giovanni appears. All seems lost until Don Giovanni ([[Jerry Stiller]]) recognizes Monte as his old childhood friend, whom Monte had built his first house. Don Giovanni yells at his hoods for not telling him that it was Monte looking to build the ski resort; otherwise he would have left his good friend alone.  Alone with his five wives, Monte asks that they make a decision about their future...leading to him getting thrown out.

Tyrone takes Joker's rifle from the unconscious Joker and gives it to Deebo so he can exact revenge on Craig. Fortunately, Chico comes out and attacks Deebo and Tyrone. The police arrive soon after and arrest Deebo, Tyrone and the Joker brothers. This gives Craig the opportunity to make off with the hydraulic pump and the cash, which does not go unnoticed by Joker as he and his brothers, along with Deebo and Tyrone are hauled away.   Craig, Day-Day and Elroy split the money, with Elroy expressing his gratitude to Craig, as Craig and Willie depart back to South Central.

The New Bremen Town Musicians
 The plot does not reveal how much time has passed from previous cartoons. A son was born to Troubadour and the Princess who has already grown up, the King became poor, and the Chieftain, along with the bandits, has reformed and retrained into a banker who owns the bank "Byaki-Buki" and lives in a comfortable manner. And although the Chieftain got rich, she still wants more – her ultimate desire is power. The Detective collects "compromising evidence" on the King and shows photos to the Chieftain depicting a lonely impoverished crying ruler. She comes to the palace of the King (whom everyone has forgotten) and invites him to marry her, assuring that she will provide him with money. But the King has not yet lost pride and refuses. Then the Chieftain returns to the bank where she has a plan to kidnap the junior Troubadour. For this she calls the Genius Detective, and he goes in search of the young Troubadour.  Troubadour Jr. is studying at the Music Academy and does not know about his origin. A donkey, a dog, a cat and a rooster try to teach him "classical music," but Troubadour Jr. dreams of "singing rock'n'roll" (although this criticism is puzzling, because the music that the quartet performs is in fact this). After offending the academicians, he remains alone and begins to dream of adventure. Immediately in front of him appears Sergeant and reveals the secret of his origin. Then he suggests to Troubadour Jr. to go to the grandfather King, to which Troubadour Jr. agrees. After meeting with him, the King cheers up and throws a ball in honor of the heir. During the ball, three robbers of the Chieftain, clad in servant costumes, catch Trubadour Jr., after lulling everyone with a tarragon containing sleeping aid. Together with the Detective, they deliver him to the bank and lock him in a safe. In the palace they leave a note from Chieftain: "Either marry me tomorrow or say goodbye to your grandson!". The king immediately raises his entire guard and makes charge against the bank "Byaki-Buki". Together with the guards the Bremen musicians also go to attack. But when they approach the bank, they are met by the Syllabus, who is an expert on martial arts. After the defeat, the musicians decide to develop a new plan. The Princess comes up with one and everyone agrees with her. The King sends a telegram to the Chieftain with the consent.  The next day a wedding cortege arrives at the palace. From it appears Chieftain in veil, and behind her are the robbers carrying a bag containing the hostage. She is met by the Dog, the Ass, the Cat and the Rooster who deliver strange verses. And while they distract the Chieftain, the Dog changes bags. Everyone is waiting for the King to show up and suddenly he appears dressed in a dressing gown, slippers and without a wig. He declares that he agrees to marry her, but refuses power and transfers the crown to his grandson. Angered by the fact that her plan fell apart, the Chieftain shouts to the King to leave. Suddenly, Troubadour Jr. appears wearing the crown and mantle and orders the guards to arrest the Robbers, Chieftain and the Detective. The confounded robbers untie the sack from which a cat jumps out. The door opens and from there comes out a huge knight's armor (on closer inspection it turns out that the Ass, Dog and Rooster are wearing the armor), threateningly approaching the kidnappers. They, in fear, run away to the jubilation of the crowd. Everyone is happy, and the young Troubadour refuses the crown and receives a guitar as a gift from his father. He finds himself new musician friends: young Donkey, Dog, Cat and Rooster. They leave with Troubadour Jr. for new adventures.  
Nine Queens
 The film opens at a [[convenience store]] early in the morning, the present time. Juan ([[Gastón Pauls]]), a [[con artist]], successfully [[Confidence trick#Well-known confidence tricks|scams]] the cashier, and later  attempts the same scam again on the next shift.  Marcos ([[Ricardo Darín]]), who has been observing him, steps in pretending to be a police officer and takes Juan away. As soon as they are far enough, Marcos tells Juan he is not actually a cop but a fellow con man. Juan asks Marcos to show him the ropes, because his father, also a con man, is in jail and he needs to raise money quickly to bribe a judge to reduce his father's sentence from 10 years to 6 months.  Then, a [[Confidence trick|scheme]] seemingly falls into their laps: Sandler ([[Oscar Nuñez]]), a former business associate of Marcos, needs his help to sell [[counterfeit]] copies he made of some rare [[Postage stamp|stamps]] called "The Nine Queens".  The potential mark is Gandolfo (Ignasi Abadal), a rich Spaniard who is facing deportation and desperate to smuggle his wealth out of the country. Gandolfo has no time to fully check if the stamps are authentic but he hires an expert (Leo Dyzen) to do a quick check and is satisfied.  He offers $450,000 for the stamps, with the exchange agreed to take place that evening. In the intervening time, the stamp expert demands from Juan and Marcos a cut, as he knew the stamps were in fact forged. The fake stamps are then stolen out of Juan and Marcos' hands by thieves on motorcycles who, unaware of their value, toss them into a river.  To salvage the scheme, Marcos approaches Sandler's widowed sister Berta (Elsa Berenguer), the owner of the real stamps, who agrees to sell them for $250,000. Marcos can put up $200,000 and asks Juan to contribute the remaining $50,000. Juan expresses his suspicion that he is being conned since Marcos seems to need exactly the amount that Juan has saved up; but as the $50,000 is not enough to help his father, Juan reluctantly agrees. They buy the real stamps and go to Gandolfo's hotel, but he says he's changed his mind and will now only buy the stamps if he also gets to sleep with Marcos' sister Valeria ([[Leticia Brédice]]), a hotel employee. Valeria's price is that Marcos must confess to their younger brother Federico ([[Tomás Fonzi]]) how Marcos cheated him out of their family inheritance in Italy. Gandolfo pays for the stamps with a [[certified check]]. However, the bank [[bank failure|crashes]] the next morning, making the check worthless.   It appears that Juan and Marcos are both ruined. In the final scene, Juan goes to a warehouse, where he greets the motorcycle thieves, Gandolfo, Sandler and his sister Berta, and Juan's fiancée Valeria — revealing that the real con was to swindle Marcos out of $200,000 as revenge for all the times he cheated his family and his partners.

Back when they were in college, the clique decided to include a new member, Eun-ju, whom Hye-jin befriended at a botanical garden. Hyun-jun fell in love with her at first sight, much to the disappointment of Seon-ae, who was in love with him. Seon-ae made Eun-ju a scapegoat for the misfortunes that the clique experienced and correctly deduced her as Kyung-ah, a girl from Seon-ae and Hye-jin's past who became an outcast for apparently causing problems around her, including the death of Hye-jin's father. Eun-ju apparently committed suicide by jumping from a building after Hye-jin rejected her.  While having sex with a prostitute, Se-hun is killed by having his eye gouged out and telephone booth glass crushing him. Down on luck, Hyun-jun blackmails Jung-wook into becoming his lawyer by threatening him with a video that could potentially scandalize him and Mi-ryeong, with whom he still maintains a relationship despite his marriage. Hyun-jun is later killed inside Se-hun's studio. Jung-wook and Mi-ryeong attempt to take the video tape, but Seon-ae has already gotten it. After dumping Jung-wook, Mi-ryeong is found dead in the shower of her bathroom.  Jung-wook tells Hye-jin that Seon-ae went to the United States to seek mental treatment, not education. Seon-ae visits Hye-jin several times to seek solace from Kyung-ah's terrors. Hye-jin takes Hyun-jun's video tape and learns that Kyung-ah was killed when she fell while attempting to strangle Jung-wook after Hye-jin rejected her, not because of suicide. Jung-wook appears and chases Seon-ae to the building where they disposed of Kyung-ah's body. He tells Hye-jin that he is the one who killed all of their friends to keep them from revealing the truth. Before he can kill them, Seon-ae impales him with a metal rod, killing him.  Some time later, Seon-ae pays visit to Hye-jin's apartment. Hye-jin tells her that they should forget everything, but Seon-ae speaks as if she is not herself. The camera turns to reveal Kyung-ah slowly slitting Seon-ae while saying "once Seon-ae is dead, we (Kyung-ah and Hye-jin) can be together...".

Nurse Betty
 In a small Kansas town, Betty, a diner waitress, is a fan of the [[soap opera]] ''A Reason to Love''. She has no idea that her husband, Del, a car salesman, is having an affair and that he intends to leave Betty. She also doesn't know that her husband supplements his income by selling drugs. When Betty calls to ask about borrowing a [[Buick LeSabre]] for her birthday, her husband tells her to take a different car. The LeSabre (unknown to Betty) has drugs hidden in the trunk.  Two [[hitman|hitmen]], Charlie and Wesley, show up at the house. They torture Del into revealing that he has hidden the drugs in the trunk of the LeSabre, but Wesley scalps him anyway. Betty witnesses the murder and enters a [[fugue state]], assuming the identity of a nurse in the daytime drama.  That evening, Sheriff Eldon Ballard, local reporter Roy Ostery, and several policemen examine the crime scene while Betty calmly packs a suitcase. She seems oblivious to the murder, even with the investigation going on right in her house. At the police station, a psychiatrist examines her. Betty spends the night at her friend's house, sleeping in a child's bedroom. In the middle of the night, she gets into the LeSabre and drives off. Betty stops at a bar in Arizona, where the bartender talks about her vacation in Rome, and Betty tells her that she was once engaged to a famous surgeon (describing the lead character from ''A Reason to Love'').  Meanwhile, the two hitmen are in pursuit, having realized that Betty has the car with the drugs. As they search, Charlie's heart begins to soften towards Betty, to Wesley's consternation. In Los Angeles, Betty tries to get a job as a nurse while looking for her long-lost "ex-fiancé". She is turned down due to having no résumé and references but manages to get a job in the pharmacy.  Despite an injunction against touching any patients, Betty becomes popular with them and their families. She ends up living with Rosa, a Hispanic legal secretary who offers to help Betty find her surgeon boyfriend. Rosa learns from a colleague that "David" is a soap opera character, and goes to the pharmacy window to confront Betty. Thinking her friend is jealous, Betty is impervious to the revelation.  The lawyer supplies tickets to a charity function where George McCord, the actor portraying David, will be appearing. Betty meets George at the function. George is inclined to dismiss her as an overimaginative fan, but something about her compels him to talk to her. He begins to think that Betty is an actress determined to get a part in the soap opera, so he decides to play along. After three hours of her "staying in character", he takes her home.  George begins falling in love with her, and he and his producer decide to bring her onto the show as a new character: Nurse Betty. When Betty arrives on set, she falls out of her fantasy world back into real life. After two failed takes, she realizes that she is on a set and that the people she thought were real are just characters. George confronts her and Betty walks out.  Back at Rosa's house, Betty has just started to tell what happened to her husband, when the two hitmen walk in. They are interrupted by Sheriff Ballard and the reporter, who have also tracked down Betty. A standoff ensues until Ballard pulls a gun from an ankle holster and shoots Wesley, who is revealed to be Charlie's son. Charlie decides not to kill Betty and commits suicide in the bathroom.

Nuremberg (2000 film)
  ===Part one=== At the close of [[World War II]], [[Hermann Göring]] ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]) surrenders to the Americans and enjoys the hospitality of a [[U.S. Army Air Force]] base. [[Samuel Rosenman]] ([[Max von Sydow]]), acting on the orders of [[U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], recruits [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]) to prepare a war crimes tribunal against Göring and the surviving [[Nazi]] leadership. Göring, [[Albert Speer]] ([[Herbert Knaup]]) and others are arrested for [[war crime]]s and imprisoned in a [[U.S. Army]] stockade at [[Mondorf-les-Bains|Bad Mondorf]] in [[Luxembourg]]. Jackson, his assistant Elsie Douglas ([[Jill Hennessy]]), and his prosecution team fly to [[Germany]].  Psychologist [[Gustave Gilbert]] ([[Matt Craven]]) arrives at the stockade with prisoner [[Hans Frank]] (Frank Moore), who has attempted [[suicide]].  Jackson negotiates with [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] representatives [[David Maxwell-Fyfe|Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe]] ([[Christopher Plummer]]), General [[Iona Nikitchenko]] (Len Doncheff) and [[Henri Donnedieu de Vabres]] ([[Paul Hébert]]) to ensure a unified prosecution. Jackson selects the [[Nuremberg Palace of Justice]] for the site of the trials and reconstruction work commences. Göring and the others are stripped of their rank and transferred to the prison in [[Nuremberg]], where they come into conflict with the guards under the command of the strict Colonel [[Burton C. Andrus]] ([[Michael Ironside]]). Major [[Airey Neave]] (Geoffrey Pounsett) serves Göring, Speer and the others with their indictments. U.S. judge [[Francis Biddle]] ([[Len Cariou]]) arrives to take control of the court but reluctantly passes the honour at Jackson’s insistence. Following the [[suicide]] of prisoner [[Robert Ley]] ([[Julien Poulin]]), round-the-clock watches are posted and Gilbert is appointed prisoner liaison.  [[Geoffrey Lawrence, 1st Baron Oaksey|Sir Geoffrey Lawrence]] (David Francis) opens the trial with all defendants pleading not guilty, and Jackson gives a stirring opening statement. At lunch a jovial Göring holds court over the other defendants while Speer begins to show signs of remorse. Maxwell-Fyfe puts forward an emotive eyewitness account of the Nazis' [[genocide|genocidal]] policies toward [[Jew]]s and others, while Jackson reads out dry documentation. As the court begins to tire of Jackson’s meticulous approach, Maxwell-Fyfe urges pushing on to the witness interviews, which reveal the horrors of the [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration camps]]. The court is shaken by documentary footage of the camps; even Göring appears unsettled.  ===Part two=== Speer explains Göring’s dominance to Gilbert and insists that his control over the others must be broken. Göring takes the stand and begins speaking to the [[German people]]. Jackson, at Gilbert’s suggestion, has Göring isolated. Under [[cross-examination]], Göring outmanoeuvers and humiliates Jackson, who later accuses Biddle of giving Göring free rein in court. Douglas talks Jackson out of tendering his resignation, and the two share a kiss. Under advice from Maxwell-Fyfe, Jackson returns to confront Göring with evidence of his crimes against the Jews and successfully dismisses the defendant’s denials.  At a [[Christmas]] party, the German housekeeper refuses to serve the [[Soviet]]s, but Douglas rescues the situation before slipping away with Jackson. Gilbert visits the defendants and, under Jackson’s advice, attempts to convince them to take responsibility for their crimes. Andrus relaxes the prison rules for Christmas, and Göring shares a friendly drink with his guard, Lt. Tex Wheelis (Scott Gibson). The cross-examination of the defendants intensifies and the defence calls [[Rudolf Höß]] ([[Colm Feore]]), who casually reveals the horrors of [[Auschwitz]]. Speer is implicated in the [[slavery|enslavement]] of foreign workers by fellow defendant [[Fritz Sauckel]] ([[Ken Kramer]]) and in response accepts collective responsibility for the crimes of the Nazi regime.  Gilbert interviews Göring’s wife [[Emmy Göring|Emmy]] ([[Susan Glover]]), who reveals that [[Hitler]] had ordered them all executed, which led to the family’s surrender. Jackson is moved by Gilbert’s [[summation]] of his examinations — that the source of the evil behind [[Nazi Germany]] was a complete lack of [[empathy]] — to give an impassioned closing statement. Göring uses his final statement to condemn the trial, and is sentenced along with several others to death by [[hanging]]. Speer uses his final statement to commend the tribunal and is sentenced to 20 years in prison. Göring commits [[suicide]] after his request to be executed by [[firing squad]] is denied. Andrus presides over the executions of the others while Jackson and Douglas head home.

O Brother, Where Art Thou?
 Three convicts, Ulysses Everett McGill, Pete Hogwallop, and Delmar O'Donnell, escape from a chain gang and set out to retrieve a supposed treasure Everett buried before the area is flooded to make a lake. The three get a lift from a blind man driving a [[handcar]] on a railway. He tells them, among other prophecies, that they will find a fortune but not the one they seek. The trio make their way to the house of Wash, Pete's cousin. They sleep in the barn, but Wash reports them to Sheriff Cooley, who, along with his men, torches the barn. Wash's son helps them escape.  Pete and Delmar are baptized by a group of Christians at a river. The group then picks up Tommy Johnson, a young black man, who claims he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for the ability to play guitar. In need of money, the four stop at a radio broadcast tower where they record a song as The Soggy Bottom Boys. That night, the trio part ways with Tommy after their car is discovered by the police. Unbeknownst to them, the recording becomes a major hit.  The trio inadvertently fall in with bank robber [[Baby Face Nelson]], and help him with a heist, before he leaves them with his share of the loot. The next day, the group hears singing. They see three women washing clothes in a river and singing. The women drug them with corn whiskey and they lose consciousness. Upon waking, Delmar finds Pete's clothes lying next to him, empty except for a toad. Delmar is convinced the women were [[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]] and transformed Pete into the toad. Later, one-eyed Bible salesman Big Dan Teague invites them for a picnic lunch, then mugs them and kills the toad.  Everett and Delmar arrive in Everett's home town. Everett confronts his wife Penny, who changed her last name and told his daughters he was dead. He gets into a fight with Vernon T. Waldrip, her new "suitor." They later see Pete working on a chain gang. Later that night, they sneak into Pete's holding cell and free him. As it turns out, the women had dragged Pete away and turned him in to the authorities. Under torture, Pete gave away the treasure's location to the police. Everett then confesses that there is no treasure. He made it up to convince the guys he was chained with to escape with him in order to stop his wife from getting married. Pete is enraged at Everett, because he had two weeks left on his original sentence, and must serve fifty more years for the escape.  The trio stumble upon a rally of the  [[Ku Klux Klan]], who are planning to hang Tommy. The trio disguise themselves as Klansmen and attempt to rescue Tommy. However, Big Dan, now a Klan member, reveals their identities. Chaos ensues, and the [[Grand Wizard]] reveals himself as Homer Stokes, a candidate in the upcoming gubernatorial election. The trio rush Tommy away and cut the supports of a large burning cross, leaving it to collapse on top of Big Dan, killing him.  Everett convinces Pete, Delmar and Tommy to help him win his wife back. They sneak into a Stokes campaign gala dinner she is attending, disguised as musicians. The group begins a performance of their radio hit. The crowd recognizes the song and goes wild. Homer recognizes them as the group who humiliated his mob. When he demands the group be arrested and reveals his white supremacist views, the crowd [[Riding a rail|runs him out of town on a rail]]. Pappy O'Daniel, the incumbent candidate, seizes the opportunity, endorses the Soggy Bottom Boys and grants them full pardons. Penny agrees to re-marry Everett with the condition that he find her original [[wedding ring]].  The next morning, the group sets out to retrieve the ring, which is at a cabin in the valley which Everett had earlier claimed was the location of his treasure. The police, having learned of the place from Pete, arrest the group. Dismissing their claims of having received pardons, Sheriff Cooley orders them hanged. Just as Everett prays to God, begging to reunite with his daughters, the valley is flooded and they are saved. Tommy finds the ring in a [[rolltop desk]] that floats by, and they return to town. However, when Everett presents the ring to Penny, it turns out it was not her ring, she doesn't want that one, and she can't remember where she put the real ring.  
Nutty Professor II: The Klumps
 After finding success with a DNA restructuring formula in the first film, [[Sherman Klump]] has created another formula which enables those who take it to find the [[Fountain of Youth]]. He has also met and fallen in love with a colleague, Denise Gaines, who has developed a method to isolate genetic material and later becomes his fiancée. Together, their work has enabled Wellman College to receive a $150 million award from a pharmaceutical firm to the excitement of Dean Richmond, who has grown to adore and respect Sherman. Despite his good fortune, Sherman has a major problem: the personality of his vanquished alter ego, Buddy Love, is still ingrained inside him and causes him to act out in the same crass manner Buddy does. Sherman tries proposing to Denise, but then Buddy kicks in and makes it a perverted sex request, causing Denise to become mortified against him.  Determined to be rid of Buddy permanently, and despite Jason warning him of potentially catastrophic consequences for his health, Sherman uses Denise's methodology to isolate and remove the gene in Sherman's [[DNA]] where Buddy has manifested and extracts it from inside his body. However, he does not dispose of the genetic material and as a result, Buddy becomes a sentient being when a hair from a [[Basset Hound]] who was Sherman's test subject finds its way into it and causes such a reaction. To make matters worse, Jason's suspicions prove correct when Sherman discovers that, due to the extraction, his brain cells are beginning to deteriorate.  Realizing he needs to keep the youth formula out of Buddy's hands, Sherman stashes it at his parents' house. Buddy, who is trying to sell the formula to a different company, quickly realizes where it is and steals some of it. Buddy also doctors the remainder with fertilizer, which causes chaos at a demonstration the next day when a hamster Sherman uses to demonstrate the youth finding effects instead mutates into an aggressive monster who violates Dean Richmond in front of a live television audience. The humiliated Dean fires Sherman, who learns that his brain's deterioration has worsened from Jason. Sherman then decides to end his engagement and break up with Denise.  In a last-ditch effort to secure the money, Sherman quickly works on a newer, much more potent formula while his mental faculties allow him to. Richmond confronts him about Buddy's actions, believing the two are working together. He leaves with Richmond and a tennis ball and head to the competing firm. Meanwhile, a worried Denise discovers what has happened and that Sherman's brain damage has progressed to almost eighty percent. Enlisting the help of Sherman's father Cletus, Denise goes after him. Sherman takes advantage of the canine DNA that crossed with Buddy's, and uses the tennis ball to play fetch. The ball is covered with the new formula, which takes Buddy back to an infantile state and eventually to a glowing mass of genetic material for Sherman to suck the genetic material back into his body through a straw, thus putting his DNA back together and returning him to normal. However, as Sherman chases what is left of Buddy, the glowing mass evaporates and thus Sherman cannot restore his intelligence.  Denise and Cletus arrive too late to save him, and seeing what has happened to Sherman, Denise breaks into tears. As they go to leave, Sherman takes a look at a fountain and remarks that it is "pretty". Seeing that the water is glowing, Denise realizes that the genetic material has reconstituted and that if Sherman drinks the water before it dissipates, he will be restored to normal. Sherman eventually drinks the water with the help of Denise and Cletus, and thus he is able to get his genetic makeup back in proper order.  The film closes with Denise and Sherman's wedding reception, with Buddy nowhere to be found. Dean Richmond rehires Sherman with a wedding present, and the hamster is back to normal and Dean Richmond decides to love the hamster.

On the Beach (2000 film)
 USS ''Charleston'' (SSN-704) is equipped with a [[magnetohydrodynamic drive|caterpillar drive]] and is on station following a [[nuclear war|nuclear exchange]], under the command of Dwight Towers.  The nuclear war which contaminated the northern hemisphere was preceded by a standoff between the United States and [[People's Republic of China|China]] after the latter blockaded and later invaded [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]. Both countries are destroyed, as is most of the world. The submarine crew finds refuge in [[Melbourne]], Australia which the radioactive fallout has not yet reached (though radio communications with several radio operators farther north than Australia indicate that radiation has reached their countries and will be in Australia in a few months). Towers places his vessel under the command of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] and is summoned to attend a briefing.  When Towers ([[Armand Assante]]), Australian scientist Julian Osborne (Bryan Brown) and Australian liaison officer Peter Holmes ([[Grant Bowler]]) find out there is an automated digital broadcast coming from [[Alaska]] in the Northern Hemisphere, the submarine is sent to investigate. En route, the submarine surfaces in [[San Francisco]], where the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] has collapsed and the city shoreline is in ruins. A crew member who is from San Francisco abandons ship, planning on dying in his home city, and is left by his shipmates after it is argued that the length of time he has spent outside has already made him sick with [[radiation sickness]].  Upon reaching Alaska, Towers and his [[executive officer]] go ashore to find no survivors. Entering a house and seeing a dead family huddled on a bed, Towers thinks of his own family and what they must have gone through. The source of the automated digital broadcast is traced to a television station whose broadcast, Towers and his executive officer discover, comes from a solar-powered [[Laptop computer|laptop]] trying to broadcast a documentary via satellite.  While in Alaska, Towers' executive officer accidentally rips his suit and hides the fact that he is becoming sicker and sicker. Upon the ''Charleston's'' return to Melbourne, he collapses and is diagnosed with terminal radiation sickness. Towers attends his old friend in his dying days and ultimately, at his request, euthanizes the man as his deteriorating condition causes him to experience extreme suffering.  Towers returns to Melbourne, where Moira Davidson (Rachel Ward) is waiting for him. Realizing the inevitable nuclear cloud will reach Australia, their impending doom begins to unravel the social fabric of the survivors in Australia and anarchy and chaos erupt. Some choose to live their final weeks recklessly in a deadly car race while others seek a more peaceful means to face the end of their lives. Holmes and his wife ([[Jacqueline McKenzie]]) seek solace in their love for each other as Towers and Moira decide become closer.  As radiation sickness befalls Melbourne, people begin lining up for suicide pills. After Mary and their daughter Jenny fall ill, Peter and his family share a final moment before taking their doses together, Peter sorrowfully injecting his daughter. Osborne races recklessly on a racetrack, ending with Osborne purposefully crashing his car for a fiery death. With most of the ''Charleston's'' crew developing advanced radiation sickness, the crew requests to take the submarine in one final voyage to San Francisco. Though they know they are unlikely to survive the trip, the crew wishes to die together on the ''Charleston'', the only real home they have left. Towers agrees and apparently abandons Moira to be with his crew. As Moira watches the ''Charleston'' sail away, Towers unexpectedly joins her, having chosen to die with Moira rather than his crew.

Once in a Lifetime (2000 film)
 The film is based around the life of Mona Berglund, a mother-of-four obsessed with the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] - so much so, that her house is decorated with posters of her idols, and she has named her children after Swedish Eurovision performers: [[Kikki Danielsson|Kikki]], [[Anna Book]], [[Lena Philipsson|Lena PH]] and [[Carola Häggkvist|Carola]]. Her partner Bosse is unemployed, and she is left to feed the family. Her brother, Candy, is a transvestite and an [[AIDS]]-sufferer who designs clothes. David, Mona's employer, a [[cerebral palsy]]-sufferer, is a proficient songwriter however, and composes a song which Mona steals and sends a demo of (with her own lyrics) into [[Melodifestivalen]], the Swedish heats for the Eurovision contest. Much to Mona's delight, the song qualifies for the finals. Mona's new-found fame takes her to unexpected places, including a TV interview, and an invitation to lunch at [[Berns Salonger|Berns]]. Throughout, the film, though, Mona is torn as to whether she should reveal that she was not in fact the only writer of her song, and thus risk losing the public's support.  
One Hundred Steps
  The film opens with Peppino as a small child singing the popular song “[[Volare (song)|Nel blu, dipinto di blu]]” with his brother in the back seat of a car on the way to a family gathering.  The family is one of good standing in the social community and they are celebrating the fact that they have such a good life.  In this scene the relationship between Peppino and his uncle Cesare is established.  His uncle is a Don or Mafia boss in the small town of Cinisi where the story is set.  In a scene soon after the happy family gathering we see don Cesare blown up by a car bomb which was planted by a rival Mafia boss.  This ends Peppino’s time of innocence.  Even as a small child he is thrust into the realities of life in the Mafia.    After his uncle’s funeral he goes to a local painter, [[Stefano Venuti]], who is also a very outspoken member of the communist party in [[Sicily]], to paint a picture of Cesare.  Stefano refuses to paint it but does not really give him a reason. He did not get along with Cesare when he was alive because of their great difference in political views but he cannot really tell this sad stubborn little boy why he cannot paint him.  Stefano ends up taking Peppino under his wing and puts his stubborn persistent energy to use in the aid of the Communist Party in [[Sicily]].  The story then jumps to when Peppino is a young adult in his early 20s  protesting against the government expropriating land that belonged to local farmers to build an airport with his Comrades in the Communist Party.  They all end up in the local jail where Peppino is bailed out by his father.    After this incident Peppino brings Stefano an article he has written for a local propaganda newspaper titled “La Mafia è una montagna di merda” or “The Mafia is a pile of shit” which Stefano deems to be too extreme and very dangerous to publish.  This is the point where there is a break between Peppino and Stefano.  Peppino becomes more and more extreme in his hatred for the Mafia and his need to expose all of the corruption that is happening in the town.  Peppino and his father get into a big fight because of this article and this begins break between Peppino and his family.    [[File:Gaetano Badalamenti's house.JPG|thumb|left|The house of [[Gaetano Badalamenti]], hundred steps from Peppino's family house]] Peppino’s next step to expose the [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] was to create a radio station with his friends called “[[radio Aut]]” which condemned the [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] and told about don Tano’s participation in the drug trade.  At this point Peppino’s father is under a lot of pressure to make his son stop what he is doing.  Peppino gets kicked out of his family’s house.  His mother is still looking out for him.  She brings him books and keeps him hidden from his father.  Meanwhile Luigi cannot handle the situation that Peppino has created at home so he goes to visit his relatives in America.  They tell him that they can get Peppino a job in radio in America if he wants.    Shortly after Luigi returns from America, he has a conversation with Peppino and then gets hit by a car on his walk home from his restaurant.  Peppino does not acknowledge his father's Mafia friends at his funeral.  This was not unexpected from him and it was rude and dangerous.  By this point Peppino starts to doubt in the people's commitment to resist the Mafia.  He feels like he is all alone in his resistance.  He decides to run for office in a local election running under a very small leftist party while continuing his radio crusade.    The [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] eventually gets tired of Peppino and decides that life would be easier without him.  They have men follow him in his car one night and when he stops at a railroad crossing they drag him out of his car beat him until he cannot move, tie him to the railroad tracks with TNT and blow him up.  His friends realize that something's up and go looking for Peppino. They cannot find anything until the morning when they find the police in the spot where Peppino has been killed. They can see the blood on the ground from where he was beaten.  They protest vehemently to the police to investigate it as a murder (as it obviously was from the evidence) but the police, having been influenced by the Mafia, rule the case terrorist act, and then later on as a suicide and leave.  At his funeral there is a huge demonstration of support from the many people who he had made an impact on in his ten years of anti-Mafia and [[Communist]] party work.    [[Peppino Impastato]] was killed on May 9, 1978.  The case was originally treated as a suicide and no one was convicted for his murder until 1997 when the case was reopened and [[Gaetano Badalamenti]] was convicted and given a life sentence for the murder of [[Peppino Impastato]].  
One of the Hollywood Ten
 The film opens at the 1937 [[Academy Awards]], where Biberman's wife, [[Gale Sondergaard]] ([[Greta Scacchi]]), wins the first ever "Best Supporting Actress" Oscar. Although the anti-[[Fascist]] sentiment in her acceptance speech gets her labelled a "commie" by some observers, she and Biberman ([[Jeff Goldblum]]) are placed under contract at [[Warner Bros.]]  He first comes under scrutiny more for his [[Jew]]ish background than his political activities. Yet, with [[Cold War]] [[paranoia]] growing, a group of Hollywood directors and actors — Biberman, Sondergaard, [[Danny Kaye]] and [[Dalton Trumbo]] among them - are labelled Communists and questioned in front of [[U.S. Congress|Congress]]. After refusing to testify against his colleagues, he is imprisoned in the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Texarkana|Federal Correctional Institution]] at [[Texarkana]] for a period of six months. Once released, he discovers his Hollywood career is finished.  Sondergaard suggests that her husband should direct a screenplay about the real-life 1950-51 strike waged by [[Mexican-American]] [[mining|miners]] against the [[Empire Zinc Company]] in [[Bayard, New Mexico|Bayard]], [[New Mexico]] written by [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]], also a victim of the blacklist and Biberman's brother Michael. She feels the lead role of Esperanza Quintero, who rallied the wives of the unemployed miners and urged them to support their husbands, is an ideal way to jump-start her stagnating career. Biberman agrees, but after meeting with the people who participated in the strike and being inspired by their passion, he decides all roles should be played by ethnic actors.  Because the film has no studio backing and most Hollywood players fear being associated with Biberman and the project, he eventually casts local residents from [[Grant County, New Mexico]] and members of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, Local 890 to fill most of the roles. Juan Chacón, the Union Local president, is cast as the fiery Ramon Quintero opposite Mexican actress [[Rosaura Revueltas]] as his wife Esperanza. [[Will Geer]] is one of only five Hollywood actors to accept a role in the production.  The [[FBI]] investigates the film's financing, attempts to steal the film's [[Negative (photography)|negatives]] and, when they can't be located, tells film-processing labs not to work on the film, incites locals who are unhappy with the film crew's presence to set fire to many of the sets and eventually deports Revueltas on bogus charges. Biberman stands his ground and completes the film, using scenes with Revueltas that were shot in her native Mexico and then smuggled into the US.

The Other Conquest
 On November 8, 1519 the Spanish Conqueror Hernando Cortés and his small army rode into the Aztec capital of the vast Aztec Empire, where they were welcomed by the Emperor Moctezuma. Within two years, the Aztec civilization was in a state of collapse, the survivors having lost their families, homes, language, temples... and gods  ''The Other Conquest'' opens in May 1520 when Topiltzin (Damián Delgado), a skillful Aztec scribe who is one of Moctezuma's illegitimate sons, survives the Massacre of the Great Temple by hiding under a corpse. After the Spaniards leave the sacred site, he finds his people dead, including his mother.  By 1526, Topiltzin is still striving to preserve the cult of [[Tonantzin]], based upon the Aztec [[Mother Goddess]]. When a squadron commanded by Captain Cristóbal (Honorato Magaloni) and Friar Diego (José Carlos Rodríguez) discover the clandestine human sacrifice of a beautiful Aztec princess, two incompatible ways of life come face to face... and violence erupts. Topiltzin manages to escape by making Friar Diego believe he is drawn to the statue of the Virgin Mary that accompanies the Spaniards wherever they go. He is eventually captured and presented to Hernando Cortés (Iñaki Aierra), who has just returned from an ill-fated campaign to Las Hibueras (today's [[Honduras]]). In an attempt to create a hybrid empire, Cortés has taken Emperor Moctezuma's daughter and heiress, the notorious [[Tecuichpo]] (Elpidia Carrillo), as his new mistress and interpreter. She reveals that Topiltzin is her half-brother, and a skeptical Cortés spares the young man's life, but in turn decides to convert him to the new Spanish ways with the aid of Tecuichpo (from now on, Doña Isabel) and Friar Diego. After being subject to a brutal ritual of conversion, Topiltzin (now called Tomás) is confined in the Franciscan Monastery of Our Lady of Light.  Five years later (1531), under the tutelage of Friar Diego, Tomás is struggling to reconcile two worlds which could hardly be more different but which also share some basic truths. However, Friar Diego realizes that Tomás and Doña Isabel are forging Cortés's correspondence with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], King of Spain. Things become even worse when Friar Diego discovers them making love inside the monastery, in a desperate attempt to perpetuate their race. Friar Diego takes it upon himself to save Tomás's soul, and asks Cortés to keep Doña Isabel from returning to the monastery. A pregnant Doña Isabel is secluded in a dungeon.  The overwhelming absence of his half-sister erodes what is left of Tomás's world. He falls into a state of desolation and illness. A well-meaning Indian nun ([[Zaide Silvia Gutiérrez]]) applies medieval remedies to him, but these only help turn his feverish attacks into [[hallucinations]] that merge Christian and Aztec imagery. Tomás has a vision whereby the Virgin Mary is revealed as the Aztec Mother Goddess.  The arrival of the statue of the Virgin Mary in the monastery, a token of gratitude from Cortés to Friar Diego, now causes Tomás to become genuinely drawn to the statue as a substitute for all he has lost, and he sets on a personal crusade to conquer her. If he absorbs her powers, if he fuses with her, redemption will follow.  Is the Indian's conversion real? Or is Tomás trying to retain his own beliefs under the guise of the new creed? Will he be able to survive with his sanity intact? These questions start revolving in Friar Diego's head, and although he puts many obstacles to keep Tomás from entering the sacristy and consummating his obsession with the statue, he finally allows Providence to decide whether Tomás's mission is legitimate or not. So who is in fact converting whom? Maybe the greatest mystery in the history of beliefs is how certain unorthodox encounters make us continue believing...

The Patriot (2000 film)
  During the [[American Revolution]] in 1776, Benjamin Martin, a veteran of the [[French and Indian War]] and a [[widower]] with seven children, is called to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] to vote in the [[South Carolina]] General Assembly on a levy supporting the [[Continental Army]]. Fearing war against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], Benjamin abstains; the vote is nonetheless passed and, against his father's wishes, Benjamin's eldest son Gabriel joins the Continentals.   Two years later Charleston [[Siege of Charleston|falls]] to the [[British Army|British]] and a wounded Gabriel returns home carrying dispatches. The Martins care for both British and American wounded from a nearby battle, before British [[Dragoon]]s, led by the ruthless Colonel William Tavington, arrive, arrest Gabriel, and take captive the African American free men and women who work Benjamin's land. When Benjamin's second son Thomas tries to free Gabriel, he is shot and killed by Tavington, who then orders the Martins' house burned, and wounded [[Regular Army (United States)|Americans]] executed. After the British leave, Benjamin gives his next two eldest sons [[rifle]]s, and they ambush the British unit escorting a tied Gabriel. Benjamin skillfully, yet brutally, kills many soldiers with his [[tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]]. A British survivor tells Tavington of the attack, earning Benjamin the moniker of the "Ghost". Gabriel decides to rejoin the Continentals and Benjamin soon follows, leaving the younger children in the care of Benjamin's sister-in-law, Charlotte. On their way to the Continental Army's camp, they witness the southern Continental Army under General [[Horatio Gates]] [[Battle of Camden|engaging]] the British Army. Benjamin recognizes the foolishness of the action; sure enough, the Continentals are decisively routed.  Benjamin meets his former commanding officer, Colonel Harry Burwell, who makes him [[colonel]] of the local colonial [[militia (United States)|militia]] due to his combat experience and also places Gabriel under Benjamin's command. Benjamin is tasked with keeping [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]]'s regiments pinned south through [[guerrilla warfare]]. French Major Jean Villeneuve helps train the militia and promises more French aid.  Gabriel asks why Villeneuve and others often mention Benjamin's role in something called "Fort Wilderness." Benjamin, having been hesitant to answer the question up to now, finally tells his son the story. Benjamin had been fighting in the British Army in the [[French and Indian War]] when he and several other soldiers discovered a French atrocity at a fort that Benjamin and his comrades had been trying to reinforce. In a bloodthirsty rage, Benjamin and his comrades caught up with the French at Fort Wilderness, where Benjamin and his unit literally cut the defending French soldiers apart slowly. Benjamin reveals that he has been haunted by guilt ever since.  Benjamin's militia harass British supply lines, even capturing some of Cornwallis' personal effects and his two Great Danes, and burn half the bridges and ferries leading to Charleston. Lord Cornwallis blames Tavington for creating this reaction with his brutal tactics. However, irritated at the lack of progress, and insulted by Benjamin's [[ruse of war|clever ploy]] to free some of the captured militia, Cornwallis reluctantly allows Tavington to stop Benjamin by any means necessary.  With the reluctant aid of the Loyalist Captain Wilkins, Tavington learns the identities of some militia members and proceeds to attack their families and burn their homes. Benjamin's family flees Charlotte's plantation as it is burned to live in a [[Gullah]] settlement with former black slaves. There, Gabriel marries his betrothed Anne. Tavington's [[brigade]] rides into the town that supplies the militia. He assembles all the townspeople, including Anne, into the church promising freedom in exchange for the whereabouts of the rebels. However, after the location is given the doors are barricaded, trapping the people as Tavington orders the church burned, killing them all in a cold-blooded act of mass-murder. After discovering the tragedy, Gabriel and several others race to attack Tavington's encampment. In the ensuing fight, Tavington mortally wounds Gabriel before fleeing. Benjamin arrives soon after, only to have another of his sons die in his arms.  Benjamin mourns and wavers in his commitment to continue fighting, but is resolved when reminded of his son's dedication to the cause by finding an American flag he repaired personally. Martin's militia, along with a larger Continental Army regiment, confronts Cornwallis' regiment in a [[decisive victory|decisive battle]] at the [[Battle of Cowpens]]. The British appear to have the upper hand until Benjamin rallies the troops forward against their lines and Tavington rushes to personally target him. The two duel and Tavington gains the upper hand, delivering several wounds to Benjamin. A beaten Benjamin slumps to his knees, and Tavington prepares to deliver the [[coup de grâce]]. At the last second, however, Benjamin dodges the attack and stabs Tavington to death, avenging his sons' deaths. The battle is a Continental victory and Cornwallis is forced to retreat.  After many eventual retreats, Cornwallis is [[Siege of Yorktown|besieged]] at [[Yorktown, Virginia]] where he surrenders to the surrounding Continental Army and the long-awaited French naval force. After the conflict ends, Benjamin returns with his family and discovers his militia men rebuilding his homestead in their new nation.  
Pay It Forward (film)
 Trevor ([[Haley Joel Osment]]) begins [[7th grade]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], his social studies teacher Eugene Simonet ([[Kevin Spacey]]) gives the class an assignment to devise and put into action a plan that will change the world for the better. Trevor's plan is a charitable program based on the networking of good deeds. He calls his plan "[[pay it forward]]", which means the recipient of a favor does a favor for three others rather than paying the favor back. However, it needs to be a major favor that the recipient cannot complete themselves.  Trevor does a favor for three people, asking each of them to "pay the favor forward" by doing favors for three other people, and so on, along a branching tree of good deeds. His first good deed is to let a homeless man named Jerry ([[James Caviezel]]) live in his garage, and Jerry pays the favor forward by doing car repairs for Trevor's mother. Trevor's efforts appear to fail when Jerry relapses into drug addiction, but Jerry pays his debt forward later by talking to a suicidal woman, who is about to jump off a bridge.  Meanwhile, Trevor's mother Arlene ([[Helen Hunt]]) confronts Eugene about Trevor's project after discovering Jerry in their house. Trevor then selects Eugene as his next "pay it forward" target and tricks Eugene and Arlene into a romantic dinner date. This also appears to fail until Trevor and Arlene argue about her love for Ricky, her alcoholic ex-husband, and she slaps him in a fit of anger. The two adults are brought together again when Trevor runs away from home and Arlene asks Eugene to help her find him.  After finding Trevor, Arlene begins to pursue Eugene sexually. Eugene has deep burn marks visible on his neck and face, and he initially resists Arlene's overtures out of insecurity. When they finally sleep together, he is seen to have extensive scarring all over his torso. Arlene accepts Eugene's physical disfigurement and forms an emotional bond with him, but quickly abandons their relationship when Ricky ([[Jon Bon Jovi]]) returns to her, claiming to have given up drinking. His return and her acceptance of it angers Eugene, whose own mother had a habit of taking his abusive, alcoholic father back. When Arlene attempts to explain to Eugene that she believes Ricky has changed for good, Eugene explains that his father intentionally burned him by knocking him unconscious, then pouring gasoline over him and igniting it. He berates Arlene for being "one of those women" and warns her of Ricky's potential to abuse Trevor. When Ricky drinks again and resumes his abusive behavior, Arlene realizes her mistake and forces him to leave.  Trevor's school assignment marks the beginning of the story's chronology, but the opening scene in the film shows one of the later favors in the "pay it forward" tree, in which a man gives a car to Los Angeles journalist Chris Chandler ([[Jay Mohr]]). As the film proceeds, Chris traces the chain of favors back to its origin as Trevor's school project. After her date with Eugene, Arlene paid Jerry's favor forward by forgiving her own mother, Grace ([[Angie Dickinson]]), for her mistakes in raising Arlene, and Grace, who is homeless, helps a gang member escape from the police. The gang member then saves a girl's life in a hospital, and the girl's father gives Chris his new car.  Chris finally identifies Trevor as the originator of "pay it forward" and conducts a recorded interview in which Trevor describes his hopes and concerns for the project. Eugene, hearing Trevor's words, realizes that he and Arlene should be together. As Eugene and Arlene reconcile with an embrace, Trevor notices his friend, Adam, being bullied by gangster-like children, as he has several times before. He pays it forward to Adam by rushing into the scene and fighting the bullies while Eugene and Arlene rush to stop him. One of the bullies takes a switchblade out of his pocket and stabs Trevor in the abdomen with it. The bullies run away and Trevor is taken to the hospital, where he dies from his injuries. This news is reported on television as well as the fact that the movement is spreading across the country; Arlene and Eugene are soon visited by hundreds of people who have participated in or heard of the "Pay It Forward" movement by gathering in a vigil to pay Trevor their respects.

Peppermint Candy
 At the beginning, the main character Yong-ho wanders to a reunion of his old student group. After causing some general mayhem with his deranged antics, he leaves and climbs atop a nearby train track. Facing an oncoming train, he exclaims "I want to go back again!" What follows is a series of prior events in the main character's life that show how he became the suicidal man portrayed in this scene.  The first flashback takes place only a few days before Yong-ho's death. At this point he is already clearly suicidal, spending the last of his money on a gun and contemplates who he should use it on. After confronting his former business partner and ex-wife Hong-ja, the husband of his teenage crush Sun-im pays him a surprise visit. Yong-ho is taken to visit a [[coma]]tose Sun-im in a hospital, and presents some peppermint candies she used to give him.  The next flashback shows Yong-ho's life five years earlier. At first glance, he seems to be a rather successful businessman, but the problems in his life become clear when he confronts his wife, who is having an [[affair]] with her driving instructor. Yong-ho is unable to claim [[moral high ground]], since he is also shown having an affair, with an assistant from his workplace. Finally, Yong-ho is shown with his wife at their new house, having dinner with his colleagues, where it becomes apparent that the marriage isn't working.  On the third flashback, Yong-ho is shown as a police officer in 1987. At the beginning, he is shown along with his pregnant wife at a mundane scene. After this, he is shown apprehending a witness and brutally [[torture|torturing]] him for information about another man's whereabouts. This leads Yong-ho to [[Kunsan]] where he and his fellow police officers capture the wanted man. While in Kunsan, Yong-ho is distracted from his work by fruitlessly trying to search for Sun-im and instead ends up on a one-night stand with a woman.  The following flashback shows Yong-ho when he is just starting his career as a policeman and is pressured by his peers to torture a crime suspect, presumably a student demonstrator. Shortly afterward, he is visited by Sun-im. Yong-ho coldly and cruelly dismisses her by feigning interest in another woman, his future wife Hong-ja. At the final scene of this sequence, Yong-ho is shown sleeping with Hong-ja, whom it is shown he never truly cared about.  During the next flashback, it's May 1980 and Yong-ho is performing his [[mandatory military service]]. While Sun-im is trying to visit him, his company is taken to quell the [[Gwangju Democratization Movement]]. Yong-ho gets shot in the leg and is told to stay behind. This leads to a scene where he confronts a harmless and presumably innocent student, whom he accidentally shoots and kills.  The last flashback shows Yong-ho as a part of the student group that reunited at the beginning of the movie. This is also where he meets Sun-im for the first time. The scene poignantly shows the innocence that Yong-ho had, before his country molded him into the violent and jaded man he is at the start of the film by pitting him against his friends.

Pitch Black (film)
 In the distant future, the ship ''Hunter-Gratzner'' is transporting passengers in [[suspended animation|cryostasis]]. Among those, a [[Muslim]] preacher who goes by the title "[[Imam]]" accompanied by three young sons traveling to New Mecca, a boy named Jack, a pair of [[Prospecting|prospectors]] named Shazza and Zeke, a merchant named Paris, and a law enforcement officer, Johns, escorting the notorious criminal Richard B. Riddick. Riddick has surgically modified eyes that allow him to see in the dark but are highly sensitive to light.  Debris from a comet tail ruptures the ship's hull, killing the captain and sending the ship off course. The surviving crew members attempt to land the ship on a nearby planet. As the ship falls apart, docking pilot Carolyn Fry attempts to dump the passenger section to reduce their weight, but co-pilot Owens prevents her. During the crash landing, several passenger compartments are destroyed and Owens sustains fatal injuries.   The group explores their surroundings, noticing that the three suns surrounding the planet keep it in perpetual daylight. They find an abandoned [[geology|geological research]] settlement, with a water well and a [[dropship (science fiction)|dropship]] with drained batteries. Zeke is killed but his body is missing, and Riddick is immediately suspected. While searching for Zeke's body, Fry barely escapes from [[photosensitive]] aggressive underground creatures. Johns offers Riddick a deal: if he helps them escape the planet, he'll go free.  The group takes a power cell to the dropship. They realize the geologists must have been all killed by the creatures. One of the young sons is ambushed and eaten inside one of the buildings. An [[orrery]] shows that an eclipse is imminent so the creatures will be free to hunt above ground. Johns informs the others that Riddick is able to pilot the dropship and Riddick reveals to Fry that Johns is actually a [[bounty hunter]] and a [[morphine]] addict.  They return to the crash site on a [[solar energy|solar-powered]] sand truck to retrieve more power cells for the dropship, but the eclipse begins before they can get back. Flying predators pour out of the ground and devour first Shazza then another pilgrim. The group salvages any light source they can find in an attempt to scare away the creatures and return to the dropship on foot. Riddick agrees to lead them in the dark thanks to his special sight. After Paris is also killed, Riddick reveals that Jack is actually female and the scent of her [[menstruation|menstrual blood]] is attracting the creatures. Johns suggests to Riddick to use Jack as bait to keep the creatures off the rest of the group during the final stretch of their march, but Riddick engages Johns in a hand to hand fight, wounds him and leaves him as a distraction instead. The rest of the survivors push on, while Riddick drags the power cells behind him.   After the last Muslim child is killed and rainfall starts putting out their [[Molotov cocktail|Molotov]] torches, the group, now down to Riddick, Fry, Jack and Imam, finds shelter inside a cave not far from the settlement. Riddick leaves them there and takes the power cells to the dropship. Inside the cave, they discover bio-luminescent worms, which they stuff in now-empty bottles to use as light. Fry leaves the cave and finds Riddick powering up the ship, ready to leave without them. She pleads with him to help her rescue the others, but instead he just offers to take her with him. Eventually, Riddick has a change of heart, and they return for Imam and Jack and take them to the ship, but Riddick is separated from the group and wounded by the predators. Fry goes back to help Riddick but is speared and carried off by a predator after finding him, presumably dying. Riddick makes it to the ship and waits until the last moment before engaging the engines to incinerate as many creatures as possible. While leaving the planet, Jack asks Riddick what they should tell the authorities about him; he tells her to say that Riddick died on the planet.

Picasso's Face
 Massimo Ceccherini is looking for a plot for his new movie: the suggestions of the people around him are all the same and they indicate "less vulgarity" and "more gags". In the end, he just settles for a long series of homages, ranging from the Rocky film series to ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', redone in a [[picaresque]] way.  
Pollock (film)
 The film opens ''[[in medias res]]'' to [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] painter [[Jackson Pollock]], autographing illustrations in a copy of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine for a woman at his 1950 art exhibit.   Nine years earlier, Pollock makes a living by exhibiting a painting in occasional group art shows. He is living with his brother Sande and sister-in-law Arloie in a tiny [[New York City|New York]] apartment. Arloie tells him that they are having a baby, hinting to Pollock that he should move out. Soon afterward, Pollock meets and takes an interest in artist [[Lee Krasner]]. Later, at dinner, he learns that his brother is moving to [[Connecticut]] to take a job building military gliders to avoid the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]]. Unable to handle conflicting feelings, Pollock goes on a drinking binge and is found in a disheveled state by Lee and Sande. Lee learns from Sande that Pollock is diagnosed as "clinically [[neurosis|neurotic]]"; still, Lee takes him home and decides to be his manager.  One day, Pollock's old friend Reuben comes along with Howard Putzel, who works for wealthy art collector [[Peggy Guggenheim]]. Guggenheim comes to see his art, and gives him a contract to sell $2400 of paintings, plus a commission to paint a mural of 8&nbsp;ft by 20&nbsp;ft on the entrance hall of her New York [[townhouse]]. His first exhibit fails to attract any buyers. After a [[New Year's Eve]] party, Pollock almost gets in bed with Peggy but is too drunk to properly perform. He falls into another drunken stupor upon hearing that Howard has died. Lee asks Pollock to make a decision: either marry her and continue painting art, or "split up". Pollock surprisingly insists on a church wedding, and Lee says she wants no guests.   Pollock and Lee move to an oceanfront house on [[Long Island]] and adopt an abandoned dog whom they name Gyp. Pollock is disheartened when Lee makes clear that she does not want to have a baby. At a get-together at Peggy's, despite art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]'s comments, he shows that it's hard for him to change his finished painting to others' liking. Pollock's pictures still aren't selling, but Clement assures him that things will change after the ''Life'' article and subsequent exhibit. Lee gets jealous when Pollock hugs another woman. Meanwhile, he tries doing other business for a living, but his [[alcoholism]] gets in the way. He lies to Sande about his financial status. Pollock's fortunes turn as the ''Life'' story is published and he tries to abstain from alcohol. Later, filmmaker Hans Namuth tries to film Pollock as he paints. However, Hans' presence interrupts the spontaneous nature of Pollock's work, making the artist feel like a phony acting it out. He loses patience and, much to Lee's disapproval, begins drinking again and ruins [[Thanksgiving]] dinner.   Five years after the 1950 exhibit, Clement tells Pollock that the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' is favoring [[Clyfford Still]], and that his original technique could be the next direction of modern art. A drunk Pollock does not take it well, and becomes even angrier when Lee berates him for his drinking and womanizing. Pollock argues it's all because she won't have a child. Lee knows he's having an affair with [[Ruth Kligman]], but won't give Jackson a divorce. When she goes to [[Venice]] to visit Peggy, Jackson receives a call from her, after which he tells Ruth, "I owe the woman something". On a subsequent visit, Ruth brings along a friend, Edith Metzger; they go for a drive, but Pollock is drunk and crashes the car, killing himself and Edith.  
Possessed (2000 film)
  [[William S. Bowdern]] ([[Timothy Dalton]]) is a [[World War II]] veteran who was severely affected by a bad experience in France on [[All Saints’ Day]] in 1944. In the first scene of the film, we flash-back through one of Bowdern's dreams to where he was trying to escape from a [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]] advance as [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) soldiers execute wounded American soldiers. A wounded soldier calls Bowdern, the [[chaplain]], to give him the [[Viaticum|Last Rites]]; Bowdern at first denies him so he can escape. Bowdern rethinks the matter and does his duty but is [[bayonet]]ted by an SS soldier. He becomes an [[alcoholic]], tormented by his injuries and the guilt of refusing a dying man's last wish.  Years later, Bowdern is teaching his students at [[St. Louis University]] (SLU) when, at the end of the lecture, an angry mob smashes the classroom's windows. When Bowdern gets out, he discovers that there is a demonstration against the school's recent [[racial integration]]. When the police arrive, he asks them to arrest "those people" &mdash; meaning the protestors &mdash; but the police arrest the black students instead. Angered, Bowdern physically attacks the cops, who arrest him as well. Father Raymond McBride ([[Henry Czerny]]) pays his [[bail]], and drives him to the [[Alexian Brothers]] Hospital to show where the church places hopeless alcoholics and the [[mental illness|mentally ill]].  Robbie Mannheim ([[Jonathan Malen]]) is sitting with his aunt, Hanna ([[Piper Laurie]]), who is teaching him how to contact the ‘other world’. Robbie's mother ([[Shannon Lawson (actress)|Shannon Lawson]]) suddenly discovers the two at the [[Ouija]] board. She scolds Aunt Hanna for disregarding her request that she must not expose Robbie to such ideas. Robbie disobeys his mother's demands that he stay away from the [[supernatural]], as he enjoys the contacts.  When Aunt Hanna dies, Robbie continues trying to reach the other world. One day one of Robbie's classmates (Sensei Jamie) during school is severely wounded in the hand when a desk falls on top of him. Robbie is blamed. Ultimately, he is expelled from school. His father (Michael Rhoades) demands to know why Robbie hurt his classmate. When Robbie explains to his father that he did not deliberately do that and the desk moved itself, his father does not believe him. During their conversation, the chair on which Robbie is sitting moves out from under him, making Robbie crash to the floor. Robbie's parents feel someone or something is trying to harm their child. They feel he may really be ‘possessed’.  They take him to the Lutheran Pastor Reverend Eckhardt ([[Richard Waugh (actor)|Richard Waugh]]), who understands what is happening to Robbie and takes him to his house to put him under exact monitoring (by putting him in a special room and attaching a light in front of his bed to help him record daily reactions by his camera). During Robbie's stay, several things occur that convince Pastor Eckhardt that Robbie is being afflicted by demons: strange noises are made in the house, the wall clock is smashed, and Robbie falls into fits of rage and [[hysteria]]. When Pastor Eckhardt tells his wife that Robbie should be treated by the Catholics, Robbie attacks him.   McBride visits the family in their house to check on Robbie after his parents go to the university requesting help. During one of Robbie's fits of hysteria, the parents find the letters SLU scrawled on his belly. When McBride enters his room, he is attacked and becomes convinced that the child is endowed with some sort of supernatural power. He convinces Bowdern to visit the family.  Bowdern visits Robbie in his room, comforting him with his knowledge of [[American comic book|comic book]]s. Bowdern notices that Robbie is interested in [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] and [[ventriloquism]], while Robbie notices that Fr. Bowdern is affected by his collection of [[toy soldier]]s that sets off a [[post traumatic stress disorder]] event. When Father Bowdern tries to convince the parents that there is nothing wrong with Robbie, the boy suddenly becomes hysterical, speaking in [[Latin]] as things fly across the room. Bowdern becomes convinced that Robbie must undergo treatment.  Bowdern and McBride go to Archbishop Hume ([[Christopher Plummer]]) to persuade him to give Robbie an [[exorcism]]. The Archbishop is skeptical, saying that he is trying to improve the [[Catholic Church]]'s public image as a modern institution, free of ancient [[superstition]]. He requests to speak to McBride alone, and he nominates Bowdern to handle the issue.  Bowdern begins Robbie's treatment, assisted by McBride and [[Walter Halloran|Father Walter Halloran]] (Michael McLachlan). They conduct several visits to him during which Robbie starts throwing temper tantrums. He scratches at them, vomits and urinates on them, and swears uncontrollably. During the treatment trials, Bowdern has flashbacks to his war experiences and dreads that this may be another failure. Robbie is transferred twice to two different churches. Finally, Bowdern manages to cure him. The room in the church where the exorcism takes place is locked on Archbishop Hume's orders.

A resident of the town, the research scientist Professor Spencer Hale, conducts research on the elusive [[Unown]]. He and his assistant, Skyler, discover a site of ruins, but Hale is sucked into the dimension of the Unown.  His disappearance leaves his young daughter Molly alone, her mother having disappeared previously. Molly finds a box of tablets containing Unown images and begins assembling the letters, which summons the Unown themselves. The Unown use their powers to make Molly's wishes come true, transforming her manor house into a crystal-like palace which spreads across the town and cuts her off from the world. Entei is created to represent Molly's father. Various people come to help sort out the Unown, including [[Professor Oak]] and [[Delia Ketchum]] ([[Ash Ketchum|Ash]]'s mother).  Meanwhile, Ash and his friends meet and befriend a trainer named Lisa. They come into Greenfield in the process and agree to join in the rescue mission to save young Molly. However, Entei kidnaps Delia, following Molly's request for a mother as well. Entei's powers hypnotize Delia into thinking she is Molly's mother. Ash, Misty, Brock and their Pokémon head out to the mansion to save Delia, communicating with Professor Oak and Skyler thanks to a PokéGear device given to them by Lisa. [[Team Rocket]] try to investigate the mansion, only to be blasted out of the air by Entei into the depths of the mansion. Molly watches Ash's [[Bulbasaur]] and [[Chikorita]] in action through a television and falls asleep, imagining herself being a Pokémon Trainer.  Seeing Ash on TV, Delia snaps out of her trance, which is not noticed by Entei, who then creates a dream version of Molly as an adult and takes her to battle the three. Molly first fights Brock, but Molly's dreamed-up Pokémon are stronger than his; Molly then has a more friendly fight against Misty in an underwater battle, but the winner is not shown.  Ash manages to locate Molly and Delia, but Molly refuses to leave with him and the mansion transforms. Entei refuses to allow Ash to leave with his mother, and fights his Pokémon. Entei defeats [[Totodile]] and [[Cyndaquil]] with ease, and battles Pikachu. He then blasts Ash and Pikachu off a cliff, but they are saved by the arrival of Ash's [[Charizard]]. Charizard, with Ash on his back, battles Entei until he is knocked out of the sky. Entei nearly kills Charizard until Molly commands him to stop and begs that no more fighting happens, which manages to stop Entei. Ash and his friends convince Molly to leave with them, Entei revealing he was created by the Unown to be her father.  The Unown suddenly lose control of their powers and start to seal the group in the mansion. Ash, Pikachu, Charizard, Misty, Brock, Delia, Molly and Team Rocket escape down to the hall where the Unown are. Pikachu and Charizard attempt to break the forcefield protecting the Unown, but they are unsuccessful—until they are joined by Entei, combining their powers to destroy the shield with Molly's support. Entei sacrifices himself and the Unown return to their dimension, reversing all of their effects on the world and returning Professor Hale to the ruins where he originally vanished.  The group ventures outside, where Professor Oak, Skyler, Lisa and others meet them. Team Rocket hides in the mansion upon seeing all of the police outside and declare that they will always have another opportunity to catch Pokémon. In the end credits, Charizard and Lisa depart from Ash's company; Molly is seen with her own [[Teddiursa]] and reunites with her father—and later, with her long-lost mother.

Taking cover from the [[police]] underneath the truck, Bodo finds Sissi, who cannot speak or breathe. In order to save her life, he performs an emergency [[tracheotomy]]. Once Sissi is in medical care, they are separated without Sissi ever learning his name.  The circumstances of her accident prevent Sissi from re-adjusting to her mundane life at the hospital, as she obsesses about tracking down her saviour. One of her patient friends, who had accompanied her on the day of her accident, helps her do so. She manages to track down Bodo, who is not interested in maintaining contact with her or any other woman. We see several times how Bodo, in a semi-conscious state, embraces a hot stove, having to be restrained by his brother Walter. It later becomes clear that Bodo is [[hallucinating]] (or perhaps [[dream]]ing) about his deceased wife, having never fully recovered from her death.  Walter tells Sissi that Bodo's wife was killed in an explosion at a [[filling station]], while Bodo was in the [[washroom]]. After Walter finishes his explanation, Bodo arrives and throws Sissi out.  Walter, employed as a security guard at a local bank, involves Bodo in a planned robbery (in preparation for their impending move to [[Australia]] together). As they are overpowering the money couriers in the vault, Sissi visits the bank, following the instructions of the letter she received from her friend (concerning the estate of the friend's mother). As she enters, she notices that Walter is employed at the bank. The alarm is tripped by one of the couriers and Walter is shot when a security guard comes to investigate. Without thinking about it, Sissi prevents the guard from shooting the brothers and helps them escape. They deliver Walter to an emergency room, where his last words to his brother are "get off the toilet, Bodo" (referring to Bodo's inability to move on after his wife's death, seeing himself stuck in the gas station's restroom). Sissi hides Bodo at the institution, where he suffers a violent [[Brief reactive psychosis|breakdown]] upon learning of his brother's death on [[TV]]. This incident brings Bodo to the attention of the head doctor at the institution, and he is treated and kept as a patient. It is during this period that Bodo explains to Sissi the true nature of his wife's death; a flashback shows Bodo and his wife engaged in a serious argument at the filling station. After heading to the [[washroom]], Bodo witnesses his wife engulfed in a huge explosion caused by her deliberate dropping  of a cigarette into a pool of [[gasoline]].  Sissi makes the decision to leave and asks Bodo to come with her, telling him of her dream in which they were "brother and sister, father and mother, husband and wife". Meanwhile, Steini, one of the patients, who recognized Bodo's identity and is jealous of him spending time with Sissi, calls the police and in a delusion tries to kill Bodo by electrocution (by throwing a toaster into Bodo's bathtub). The delusion, really a [[Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder|flashback]], reveals that Steini had killed Sissi's mother the same way. Bodo however catches the toaster out of the air before it can fall into the tub and chases Steini into the attic. Meanwhile, the police arrive, and Sissi realizes that her mother was in fact murdered and did not commit suicide. She follows Steini to the roof, who offers to jump to atone for his actions. She declines, saying "You're not going to jump anyway", grabs Bodo's hand, and together they jump from the roof of the building, into a small pond.  The final scene (taking place at the scene of Bodo's wife's accident) strays into a bit of [[surrealism]]: Bodo's past personality, unkempt and finally emerging from the gas station restroom, takes a seat behind the wheel, while the real Bodo gets in the back of the car. As they drive off, Sissi touches (old) Bodo's face to wipe away his tears, but he stops her and does so himself, pushing her away yet again. This visibly stirs (real) Bodo, who leans forward and covers his former self's eyes, forcing him to brake. "Real" Bodo tells "old" Bodo to get out and leaves him standing in the middle of the road thus symbolically taking over "old" Bodo's life; perhaps a visual metaphor for beginning anew.  In the international version of the movie, a small scene commences with the abandoned "old" Bodo as a more resolved ending to this surrealistic character and moment. Turning, he notices a sign indicating a bus stop in the field off the road; he waits by it, and an empty bus, driven by Walter, soon arrives to pick up this "dead" version of Bodo. The brothers do not speak, and they drive off a short distance before disappearing.  The film ends with Bodo's redemption through his acceptance of Sissi, as he is shown at last content and dry-eyed as the couple arrive at the friend's seaside house on the edge of a cliff (the friend from the beginning of the movie).  
Psycho Beach Party
 Florence Forrest ([[Lauren Ambrose]]) is a [[Gidget]]-like character<ref name="NYT"/><ref name="SFC"/> determined to learn to surf, and earns the nickname "[[Chiclets|Chicklet]]" from the surfer guys.  However Chicklet begins displaying multiple personalities, experiences inexplicable blackouts, and fears that she might be the one responsible for a series of mysterious murders in her beach-side town. The deaths are investigated by Captain Monica Stark ([[Charles Busch]]), who also suspects Chicklet's mother ([[Beth Broderick]]), Chicklet's best friend Berdine (Danni Wheeler), surfing guru The Great Kanaka ([[Thomas Gibson]]) and B-movie actress Bettina Barnes ([[Kimberley Davies]]).  Other characters include university drop-out (and Chicklet's love interest) Starcat ([[Nicholas Brendon]]), purported Swedish exchange student Lars ([[Matt Keeslar]]), surfers Yo-Yo (Nick Cornish) and Provoloney ([[Andrew Levitas]]), Starcat's girlfriend Marvel Ann ([[Amy Adams]]), and the wheel-chair bound class "queen bee" Rhonda ([[Kathleen Robertson]]).  
Proof of Life
 Alice Bowman ([[Meg Ryan]]) moves to the (fictional) [[South America]]n country of Tecala because her engineer husband, Peter Bowman ([[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]]), has been hired to help build a new [[dam]] for [[oil company]] Quad Carbon. While driving one morning through the city, Peter is caught in traffic and then ambushed and abducted by [[guerrilla]] rebels of the Liberation Army of Tecala (ELT). Believing that Peter is working on Quad Carbon's [[oil pipeline]], ELT soldiers lead him through the [[jungle]].  Terry Thorne ([[Russell Crowe]]), a former member of the British [[Special Air Service]], arrives in [[Tecala]] fresh from a successful hostage rescue in [[Chechnya]]. As an expert negotiator in [[kidnapping]]-and-[[ransom]] cases, he is assigned by his company, Luthan Risk, to bargain for Peter's safe return. Unfortunately, it is learned that Quad Carbon is on the verge of [[bankruptcy]] and [[takeover]], and therefore has no [[insurance]] coverage for kidnapping, so they cannot afford Thorne's services. Despite Alice's pleas to stay, Thorne leaves the country. Alice is then assigned a corrupt local hostage negotiator, who immediately urges her to pay the ELT's first ransom demand: a $50,000 "good faith" payment. Not knowing what to do, Alice agrees, but the transaction is stopped by Thorne who (due to his conscience) has returned to help. He is aided by Dino ([[David Caruso]]), a competing negotiator and ex–[[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]].   Over the next few months, Thorne uses a [[radio]] to speak with an ELT contact, and the two argue over terms for Peter's release—including a [[ransom]] payment that Alice can afford. Thorne and Alice bond through the ordeal, forming an implicit attraction. They eventually negotiate a sum of $650,000.  Meanwhile, Peter has become a prisoner at the ELT's jungle base camp. There, he befriends another hostage named Kessler ([[Gottfried John]])—a missionary and former member of the [[French Foreign Legion]]—who has lived in the camp for nineteen months. The two concoct an escape plan, but during their attempt they are quickly tracked by the ELT. Kessler falls into a river after being shot in the shoulder and manages to escape, but Peter steps on a trap and is recaptured. Kessler is found and hospitalized. Thorne's ELT contact subsequently refuses to respond to his calls. Luckily, one of Alice's young maids recognized his voice over the radio and reveals he is a government official. Thorne goes to a parade ceremony and confronts the contact; he confirms that Peter is alive, but because of the ELT's escalating war with the government and Peter's knowledge of the terrain, the ELT will no longer negotiate.  At Thorne's urging, Alice and Kessler convince the Tecala government that the ELT is mounting an attack on the pipeline being built through their territory. This forces the government army to mobilize, thus forcing a bulk of the camp's ELT troops to mobilize for a counter-attack. Thorne, Dino, and several associates are then inserted by helicopter and raid the weakened ELT base. They overcome the camp's soldiers, free Peter and another hostage, and then fly back to the city, where Alice happily reunites with her husband. Thorne and Alice share a final intimate moment before the latter departs with Peter on an immediate flight to the U.S.  
The Prophecy 3: The Ascent
 Danyael Rosales is a street preacher who thinks [[God]] does not care about anyone because of the death of his parents, Valerie Rosales and the angel Danyael from the previous film. He is then forced to face his destiny. As a [[Nephilim]], he has some of the angels' abilities, such as regeneration, and can only be killed if his heart is removed.  One night, a blind assassin shoots Danyael as he preaches before a crowd, but the assassin is driven off before he can take out Danyael's heart. As punishment for his failure, Zophael kills the assassin and goes after Danyael himself with an extendable weapon with a blade that can be turned into a three-pronged hook. However, Danyael is protected by Gabriel, a now-human fallen angel who killed Danyael's father and performed many misdeeds. After being defeated by Danyael's mother, Gabriel was turned into a human as punishment. Having spent years as a human, he now realizes how wrong he was in the past.  Zophael convinces Danyael's girlfriend Maggie to work with him to stop Danyael, but when she becomes suspicious of his motives, she shoots the angel. It has little effect on Zophael, and he tells her what he is. Frightened and confused, Maggie agrees to help him, and the two catch up to Danyael on a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] reservation, where he is going to confront Pyriel, another angel who wants to overthrow God. Danyael briefly meets Mary, a Native American woman (first introduced as a child in the [[The Prophecy|first film]]).  Mary informs Danyael that she dreamed of his coming, and that she believes he will be victorious against Pyriel.  After parting from Mary, Danyael is attacked by Zophael, crashing Maggie's truck and badly injuring her. He then faces off against Danyael in battle and seemingly defeats him by impaling his chest with a motorcycle tailpipe, but the angel gets back up and uses his weapon to impale Danyael from behind. Before Zophael can remove Danyael's heart, Maggie empties her gun into him, stunning him.  Danyael takes his chance and removes Zophael's heart through the hole he created earlier, finally killing him.  Danyael heads off to face Pyriel, armed with Zophael's weapon while Gabriel watches over Maggie. He confronts Pyriel, but is no match for him, although he succeeds in impaling him with Zophael's weapon. Danyael is about to lose when God seemingly sends down a [[Thunderbolt|lightning bolt]], electrocuting the weapon and, through it, Pyriel, weakening him. Danyael extends the blade into its [[Tine (structural)|prong]] form and removes Pyriel's heart with it, killing him and apparently ending the war in Heaven. He returns to Gabriel and Maggie, who is on the verge of death. Maggie is saved when Gabriel's angelic powers return to him and he heals her wounds on his way back to Heaven.

Python (film)
 The crew of a plane gets nervous when the cargo it is carrying starts making noises and shifting. When one of the crew opens the crate, the pilot hears screams from the back.  Something attacks him, causing the plane to crash near a town called Ruby.<ref></ref> The cargo survives the crash and begins attacking Ruby citizens, starting with a [[lesbian]] couple camping in the woods.  At a swimming hole the next day, John Cooper (Rosanoff), his girlfriend Kristin (Barron), his best friend Tommy (Wheaton), and Tommy's girlfriend Theresa (Mornell) find a pet [[burmese python]] belonging to one of the dead women, Lisa. Deputy Greg (Zabka) shows up, mentioning that Lisa is missing and takes the snake.  Lisa's body is found, appearing to have been corroded by acids.  Greg suspects John, since he works at a plant that uses acids. Complicating things, Greg is also Kristin's ex-fiancé, with her having left him when her first love came back to town.  Scientist Anton Rudolph (Englund) is talking with [[NSA]] Special Agent Parker (Van Dien), explaining that the cargo is an abnormally large [[reticulated python]] that has been genetically engineered in Southeast Asia, blending several species.  In the words of Dr. Rudolph, it is "a perfect killing machine, a 129-foot-long all-terrain vehicle capable of speeds exceeding 50 miles an hour, with skin that can deflect an antitank round, enhanced night vision, and a voracious appetite for human flesh".  The NSA team plans an assault against the snake, hoping to kill it discreetly before it eats more people.  The snake kills a real estate agent (Williamson) and beheads the agent's client (McCarthy).  It leaves behind the client and the body of the other lesbian, Roberta Keeler.  John enters as the snake leaves, furthering suspicion against him.  The sheriff shuts down his brother Brian's plant, furthering the tensions between Brian and him.  As John leaves the plant, he runs into Greg's car and his bike is damaged.  They end up in a fist fight, mostly over Kristin, though they ultimately reconcile.  When the body of the real estate agent is found with the same acid damage, the sheriff orders John arrested. Kristin yells at Greg when they come to arrest John, but he says that he does not think John is the killer.  The NSA team and Rudolph arrive, telling the sheriff a story about a psychotic rogue operative imprisoned in a military psychiatric unit who escaped and is committing the murders.  He does not believe them, but goes back to the office and frees John.   Kristin, Tommy, Theresa, and he plan to go on a trip the next morning.  The NSA set up base at a water-treatment center. They use radar to find where the snake is likely to be, then have the police set up a perimeter to keep people out of the zone. Believing the snake to be sleeping, the team wastes most of its ammunition on the snake's shed skin. Agent Parker realizes the snake set them up using its skin as a decoy. The snake arrives and kills the team; only Rudolph survives after keeping himself standing perfectly still in front of the creature.    Theresa's morning shower is interrupted by the snake. Though she is able to escape, the snake eats Tommy. Theresa drives away, but the snake follows. It gets in front of her and rips the rear axle off, disabling the truck. She gets away again and hides in a crevice.  When Tommy and Theresa do not arrive to pick them up, John and Kristin go looking for them, finding the wrecked truck.  Theresa tries to warn them as the snake comes to attack, but they cannot hear her. John and Kristin escape using Tommy and Theresa's bikes from the truck. They make it to the water-treatment center, where Theresa later joins them, and find Rudolph in shock. The group realizes that they must do something about the snake or it will get to the town.  They call Greg on the radio and fill him in on a plan they have devised.  They lure the snake into the water-treatment plant by having it chase John through a shaft, while they set a bomb near the entrance.  Kristin drops a line down another shaft for John to escape. The other two escape through the regular door, where Greg is waiting to drive them to the other shaft. They pull John out and the python is unable to climb up the shaft. Trapped in the tunnel, the python returns to the doorway entrance. The group returns to the entrance to trigger the bomb, but it does not detonate. Rudolph says the snake must have torn out the antenna when it crashed into the bunker, so he leaves his pet snake with Kristin and runs back in to reset it. While Rudolph resets the charges, he is confronted by the snake, but is able to succeed in his task. The charges go off, killing Rudolph, and the other four are celebrating their success, but the python emerges unscathed.  They flee in Greg's police car, and come up with a new plan to penetrate the snake's hide by luring the snake into a vat of [[acid]] at John's plating plant. Once there, John acts as the bait once again, while Kristin uses a winch to push the snake's underbelly into one of the vats, causing the snake to be disemboweled and killed by the acid.  Six months later, Greg has been accepted into [[FBI Academy|Quantico]] to be an [[FBI]] agent, the plant has been reopened as a bar/bike shop where the snake's skin is used as a sales tool, and John finds out that Kristin and he are soon to be parents.  
Purely Belter
 The events take place over a year, the film being divided into four sections named after the four seasons.  Sewell and Gerry, football-mad teenagers from broken families in [[Gateshead]], break into Newcastle United's [[St James' Park]] stadium and steal the "sacred" turf from the penalty spot. After this success, they dream of earning money to get season tickets, with aid from their guardian angel, the [[Angel of the North]]. For the two tickets they plan to buy, they will need nearly a thousand pounds. After attempts to make money from collecting scrap and baby sitting, they eventually graduate to more criminal activities, including [[shoplifting]] and housebreaking. Gerry keeps the money they accumulate in a tin box at home.  Sewell, who lives with his permanently befuddled grandfather ([[Roy Hudd]]), adopts a dog who follows him after wandering away from his owner, a local thug. He also dreams of Gemma, a girl who is engaged to Zak, a muscular ice-hockey player for the "[[Whitley Warriors|Whitley Bay Warriors]]". At home, Gerry lives with his sickly mother ([[Charlie Hardwick]]) and his sister Clare (Tracy Whitwell) who has a baby called "Sheara". They are separated from their violent father Billy ([[Tim Healy (actor)|Tim Healy]]) who has been sexually abusing Gerry's other sister Bridget, who has run away from home. When Billy finds where they live and badly beats Gerry's mother, the family have to move to a secret location. Gerry is bribed by a social worker to attend school for two weeks after which he will get two free football tickets. At the school he is bullied by his teacher ([[Kevin Whately]]). Gerry and Sewell attempt to rob his house in revenge, but are nearly caught. When Gerry gets the tickets he is horrified to discover that they are for a [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] match. After failing to sell them, the two friends watch the match at the [[Stadium of Light]].  Billy finds the family's new [[Apartment|flat]] and steals all the money Gerry has accumulated. At an empty fairground, Gerry spots his sister Bridget ([[Kerry Ann Christiansen]]), who is now a drug addict sleeping rough, but she disappears when he leaves to get some food. After Gemma breaks up with Zak the ice-hockey player, she becomes Sewell's girlfriend. The lads' shoplifting is shown on the TV show [[Crimestoppers]]. The thug who originally owned the dog sees the show and spots the animal with Sewell. He finds and attacks him. The seemingly weak and mild-mannered Sewell floors him with a single blow on the neck. At the Newcastle United Training ground at the Riverside pavilion (Chester-le-street), they briefly meet Alan Shearer and ask him to give them season tickets, but he just laughs. They steal a sports car, which turns out to be Shearer's. Looking at his CDs, Sewell is appalled by his musical tastes - ([[Gabrielle (singer)|Gabrielle]] and [[Celine Dion]]). Eventually they leave the car and go [[skinny dipping]].  Sewell is delighted when Gemma reveals she is pregnant, but horrified when she goes back to her former fiancé. Sewell attacks him during an ice-hockey match and knocks him out, but is beaten up by his team mates. Gerry's mother becomes ill and is hospitalised. Gerry finds Billy, who ignores his pleas for support. Having lost all their earnings, Sewell and Gerry decide on one last major crime - a bank robbery. The crime goes disastrously wrong and the lads end up under arrest. However, Gerry learns that Billy has been killed in a road accident. The friends are sentenced to 200 hours of [[community service]]. One old lady they work for allows them to watch Newcastle play from the balcony of her towerblock, which overlooks the stadium.

Quills
 ''Quills'' begins in Paris during the [[Reign of Terror]], with the incarcerated [[Marquis de Sade]] penning a story about the libidinous Mademoiselle Renard, a ravishing young aristocrat who meets the preeminent sadist in her executioner.  Several years later, the Marquis is confined to the asylum for the insane at [[Charenton (asylum)|Charenton]], overseen by the enlightened [[Abbé de Coulmier|Abbé du Coulmier]]. The Marquis has been publishing his work through laundress Madeleine "Maddy" LeClerc, who smuggles manuscripts through an anonymous horseman to a publisher. The Marquis' latest work, ''[[The Misfortunes of Virtue|Justine]]'', is published on the black market to great success. Emperor [[Napoleon|Napoléon I Bonaparte]] orders all copies of the book to be torched and the author shot, but his advisor, Delbené, tempers this contentious idea with one of his own: send alienist Dr. Royer-Collard to assess Charenton and silence the Marquis. Meanwhile, the Abbé teaches Madeleine to read and write and resists his growing attraction to her. Madeleine reads the Marquis de Sade's stories to her fellow workers. Whilst Madeleine is fascinated by the Marquis de Sade she remains reluctant to give into his advances. The Abbé and Marquis converse on the Marquis' inappropriate advances on young women.  Dr. Royer-Collard arrives, informing the Abbé that the Marquis' "therapeutic writings" have been distributed for public consumption. He presents the Abbé with the ultimatum of silencing the Marquis or Charenton will be shut down by order of the Emperor. The Abbé rejects Royer-Collard's offers of several aggressive archaic "treatments" and asks to speak with the Marquis himself, who promptly swears obedience (winking at Madeleine through a peephole). Royer-Collard takes his leave for the time being and travels to the Panthemont Convent in Paris to retrieve his promised bride, the underage orphan Simone. They are given a run-down chateau by the Emperor, with a handsome young architect, Prouix, on hand for its renovation.  The hasty marriage incites much gossip at the asylum, prompting the Marquis to write a farce to be performed at a public exhibition, which Dr Royer-Collard and his young wife attend. The audacious play, a shockingly straightforward parallel of the good doctor's own misogynist domination of his virginal bride, is titled "''The Crimes of Love''". The performance is interrupted when the inmate Bouchon molests Madeleine off-stage, prompting her to hit him in the face with an iron. The Abbé is seen publicly comforting Madeleine. Royer-Collard shuts down the public theater and demands that the Abbé do more to control the Marquis, or he will inform the ministry that the inmates are running the asylum. Infuriated, the Abbé confiscates the Marquis' quills and ink. The Marquis's wife visits him and he takes out his frustration at not being able to write on her; she retaliates by asking a surprised Dr Royer-Collard that the Marquis be entombed forever. They discuss that the ill-gotten gains from the Marquis's books could be used to effect his salvation, in other words, provide forms of restraint. The lack of writing implements results in more subversive behaviour from the Marquis, including a story written in wine on bedsheets and in blood on clothing. This results in further deprivation, eventually leaving the Marquis naked in an empty cell. Charlotte, one of the maids, reveals that Madeleine has been helping the Marquis. Madeleine is whipped on the order of Dr. Royer-Collard until the Abbé stops him by offering himself instead. The Abbé decides that Madeleine must be sent away. That night she visits his chamber to beg him to reconsider sending her away and confesses her love for him in the process, prompting him to kiss her passionately. They abruptly break away at the realization of what they are doing. Madeleine runs off and Charlotte catches the Abbé calling after her.  Meanwhile, Royer-Collard violently raped Simone on their wedding night, and continues to keep her as a virtual prisoner. She purchases a copy of ''Justine'', seduces Prioux, and the young lovers run off to England together. She leaves behind a letter explaining her actions and her copy of ''Justine''. Upon finding this, Royer-Collard seizes on the Marquis as the source of his troubles and embarks upon a quest for revenge, by having him tortured.  About to be sent away from Charenton for her role in assisting the Marquis, Madeleine begs a last story from him, which is to be relayed to her through the asylum patients. Bouchon, the inmate at the end of the relay, is excited by the story, breaks out of his cell, and attacks Madeleine. Royer-Collard hears Madeleine's screams but chooses to ignore them and she is killed by Bouchon. The asylum is set afire by the [[pyromania]]c Dauphin and the inmates break out of their cells.  Madeleine's body is found by her blind mother and the Abbé in the laundry vat. The Abbé is devastated by Madeleine's death and Bouchon is captured and imprisoned inside an iron maiden. The Abbé blames the Marquis for Madeleine's death and prods him into a fury. The Marquis claims he had been with Madeleine in every way imaginable, only to be told she had died a virgin. The Abbé has the Marquis' tongue cut out as punishment for his involvement, but is riddled with remorse and physically punishes himself. The Abbé then has a dream in which Madeleine comes alive and they have sex, but ultimately it ends with him holding her corpse. The Marquis' health declines severely, but he remains perverse as ever, decorating his dungeon with a story, using faeces as ink. As the Marquis lies dying, the Abbé reads him the last rites and offers him a crucifix to kiss. The Marquis defiantly swallows the crucifix and chokes to death on it.  A year later, the new Abbé arrives at Charenton and is given the grand tour by Royer-Collard. During the tour they meet the maid Charlotte and through the exchange between herself and Royer-Collard it is apparent that there is a connection. The asylum has been converted into a print shop, with the inmates as its staff. The books being printed are the works of the Marquis de Sade. At the end of the tour, the new Abbé meets his predecessor, who resides in the Marquis' old cell. Yearning to write, he begs paper and a quill from the new Abbé, and tries to strangle Royer-Collard when he ventures to close the peephole. The Abbé is herded off by Royer-Collard before he can hear anymore from his predecessor. However, the peephole opens, and Madeleine's mother thrusts paper, quill, and ink through. The Abbé begins to scribble furiously, with the Marquis providing the narration.  
Raju Chacha
  Siddhant Rai ([[Rishi Kapoor]]) is a wealthy architect, living a comfortable lifestyle with his three children Rohit, Rahul and Rani. Also living with them is their butler B.B.C ([[Tiku Talsania]]). Because they have no mother, Siddhant has arranged for many governesses or teachers to take care of them, but the children always drive any of these governesses and teachers away. Siddhant soon decides to send his children to boarding school but changes his mind when B.B.C reminds him that when Siddhant threw his younger brother out of the house, he never came back again. Siddhant, however, arranges for another governess.  Meanwhile, a con man named Shekhar ([[Ajay Devgn]]) and his friend Jadu ([[Johnny Lever]]) have just robbed a bank and are on the run from police. Shekhar comes across the beautiful Anna ([[Kajol]]) who is to be the governess of the Rai children. Shekhar tries to woo Anna with no success. Shekhar and Jadu follow Anna to the Rai household; Shekhar now believes he has met a rich girl and believes he has hit the jackpot. Although the children initially try and drive Anna away, they come to accept her as an older sister. Shekhar continues to woo Anna and she eventually returns his feelings. With Siddhant's permission, the two get married. On the wedding day, Siddhant learns that Shekhar is a criminal: he stole the wedding rings and only married Anna to gain Siddhant's wealth. Shekhar is sent to prison and Anna decides to leave the house.  Siddhant is soon killed in a car accident. The children are placed under the care of their cruel maternal uncles, who only have interest in Siddhant's fortune. The children are in a terrible situation&mdash;the court decides that they need to be separated. Just as the magistrate intends to sign their adoption papers, a young man comes in and claims that he is Rajit Rai, Siddhant's younger brother&mdash;the man is none other than Shekhar. The magistrate believes that the man is truly Siddhant's brother, so refuses to sign the adoption papers, however he sets a date for a hearing in which the appropriate guardian shall be granted custody of the Rai children. The children are at first unhappy to have Shekhar back in their lives&mdash;however, B.B.C and Jadu explain that Shekhar is the only one who can help the children. The children warm up to their new 'Raj Chacha.' Anna soon returns to the house and is angry to see Shekhar again as she believes he is attempting to rob the children. Problems arise when another man ([[Sanjay Dutt]]) enters the house and says that he is Rajit Rai. The uncles are now confused as this man looks and acts more like the real Rajit Rai. Shekhar makes a deal with them - if they prove to the magistrate that Shekhar is the real Raju Chacha, he shall only take 25% of the share. The uncles agree but soon learn that Shekhar tricked them and that the 'real' Raju Chacha they met is none other than a fellow conman of Shekhar's. The relatives are driven away. Anna reconciles with Shekhar when she learns his real intentions. Anna and Shekhar start to look after the children.  However, their happiness is short-lived when the relatives return and expose Shekhar, who is sent back to jail. Meanwhile, the children are shocked to learn that their father was killed by their relatives, all for his money. The children's lives are again in danger until Shekhar breaks out of prison and kills the relatives in the same way that killed Siddhant. Shekhar and Anna get married and are given custody of the three children. However, they are still on the lookout for the real Raju Chacha.

Ready to Rumble
 For most of their lives, Sewage workers Gordie Boggs and Sean Dawkins have been avid wrestling fans. When ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' comes to their home state of Wyoming, they attend the show to watch their favorite wrestler, [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|WCW World Heavyweight Champion]] Jimmy King get cheated out of the title by [[Diamond Dallas Page]], and WCW CEO Titus Sinclair, and DDP's partners. After the match, the two wrestling fans humorously express their rage in their septic truck, resulting in a car crash.  After this event, Gordie believes that the car crash was fate and that they should make Jimmy King once again World Champion. Sean agrees to help Gordie, and the dimwitted duo go on a quest to put their King back on his throne. The next day, Gordie asks a friend to find out where the washed-up wrestler lives. Their friend succeeds, and they go to an unexpected-looking neighborhood. They find King's estranged wife and later his parents. The parents tell them that King borrowed their mobile home, and never returned it. The duo find King and become over-excited. They have a conversation, and when King says that he gives up on wrestling, Gordie and Sean anger him to the point where he suddenly attacks the two boys. The boys encourage King to beat them up, which influenced him to return to wrestling. Then Gordie and Sean are knocked out when Jimmy King does his finishing move.  The two boys wake up the next day when Jimmy King drips beer on their faces. Later that day, the trio go on a road trip. Gordie sends letters to his father, who wanted Gordie to follow in his footsteps to be a policeman, but Gordie says that he will not join him in a policeman test, making him frustrated. Gordie, King, and Sean go to the New York Arena where they hide King in a port-a-potty and they meet Sasha, one of the [[Nitro Girl]]s. When DDP mocks Jimmy King on camera, King comes out of the port-a-potty and beats him up. Sinclair, therefore, declares a Triple Cage match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship plus a $1,000,000 cash prize. However, if King loses, he will never wrestle again.  Sasha is impressed by Gordie, and they go to her apartment. Jimmy King is in deep need of a trainer. They go to a local training center, where King meets his former partner, [[Bill Goldberg]]. They also find Sal Bandini, who beats up King. He is then hired as their trainer, but he is hospitalized when [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]] and [[Perry Saturn]] attack him that night. Gordie finds out that Sasha has been spying on them for Titus and breaks up with her. They take King to his wife's home.  When they try to get a new partner for King, Gordie's father comes along, gets Gordie and convinces him that his dream of working with Jimmy King was stupid. When Gordie was at home, Sean and King tried to bust him out, but Gordie refused (an ironic change in Gordie as he once encouraged King to return to wrestling). But the next day, Gordie comes at an entourage audition and is thanked by King for everything Gordie did for him. No one, however, was able to make the cut, and so King has to face DDP alone. Initially King is alone, but after he gets a horrible beatdown by DDP and his goons starting with King's own son, [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], [[Billy Kidman]], [[Disco Inferno (wrestler)|Disco Inferno]] come to his aid but aren't able to get into the cage until Gordie shows up and crashes a motorcycle through the cage door. Gordie and the others deal with DDP's posse and defeat them while King and DDP climb the cage to get the belt. Sasha attempts reuniting with Gordie as the fans love him, but is knocked out by a ladder being swung around during the match after not listening to Sean's warning. DDP manages to throw King back to the mat, but is knocked back there himself by [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]]. The two climb to the top again and fight it out and King manages to defeat DDP, throwing him through the cages to the mat, knocking him out. King retrieves the belt and is once again champion. After this, Sinclair is booed by the fans then beaten up by Sean and Gordie who toss him to the fans who beat him up some more. Goldberg later asks King to re-team with him, but the new champ announces his new partner will be Gordie and their manager will be Sean. Gordie's father watches the match on TV and after seeing how good Gordie is, accepts Gordie's choice and even cheers for him.  The [[epilogue]] shows Sean telling kids "dreams can come true" back at the convenience store, where Gordie and Goldberg teach the clerk a lesson by hurling him out on the street for being mean to kids. All ends happily as the heroes ride off in a stretch Hummer (driven by Nitro Girl Chae), together with Sal, now fully recovered in a [[hot tub]] with beautiful women and ends it by saying "God bless America".  The end credits feature out-takes of kicks to the groin.

Rat (film)
 After his usual night of drinking at the local pub, Hubert Flynn ([[Pete Postlethwaite]]) returns home and transforms into a rat. Hubert's family each have different views on him now that he became a rodent. His wife Conchita ([[Imelda Staunton]]) thinks that this change is supposed to be a lesson to Hubert and that the reason he transformed is his own fault. Their son Pius ([[Andrew Lovern]]), destined for a religious life, feels that because his father is now an animal, his family should kill him. Their daughter Marietta ([[Kerry Condon]]) feels that the rat is still her father and that they should treat him with love and respect.  After hearing the news of a man changing into a rat on the local radio, [[ghostwriter]] Phelim Spratt ([[David Wilmot (actor)|David Wilmot]]) convinces Conchita to write a book of the story. Because Phelim wants to write about Conchita's bravery and the family's loyalty to Hubert in the face of adversity, he suggests that they take Hubert out to the pub and [[bookie]] to see his friends and to show the public that they are proud of him.  Conchita sends for her brother, Matt ([[Frank Kelly]]), whom she describes as "a rock of sense". After telling the family all of the changes they will have to undergo, including Hubert's poor hygiene, unemployment, and unusual diet, Matt feels that Hubert would be more comfortable in a maggot factory with other rats. This decision is further solidified after Hubert bites Conchita on the finger.  After the family leaves him at the maggot factory, Hubert treks forty miles back to the house to be with his family on Christmas. With Hubert nearly dead from exhaustion, Conchita calls the doctor ([[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]]) and sends Pius to get Father Geraldo ([[Niall Toibin]]) to perform the [[last rites]] and an [[exorcism]]. After the doctor tells Conchita to cool Hubert down because of his fever, they put him in the refrigerator. Father Geraldo then arrives and performs the exorcism and Hubert emerges from the refrigerator as a man.  Because Hubert turned back into a man, Phelim and Conchita are nervous that no one will believe their story. They decide to lock Hubert in his room and use a replacement rat for public appearances. However, Hubert's old flame and neighbour, Daisy ([[Veronica Duffy]]) becomes sceptical when she hears him yelling that he needs to use the bathroom and calls for the police to investigate. While Hubert is in the bathroom, he remembers that as a rat, he saw Phelim hide the manuscript of the book in a cupboard. He takes the manuscript and hides it in his shirt. When the family realise that Hubert should be away from prying eyes, Conchita goes to tell him that they are sending him to a mental hospital until the book comes out.  When the police arrive, Marietta finds a letter written by her father saying that he feels the same way that he did before he turned into a rat. A rat then runs out the door and the family chases it in the street. When they get the rat back, Phelim tries to put it in the oven and it bites him on the finger. Hubert then appears behind them as a man and explains that the rat Phelim is holding is Conchita. He says that when he bit her earlier, he felt something leave his body and enter hers. He then explains that instead of a book about the family's loyalty, Phelim has been writing about their thoughts of killing Hubert and plans to abandon him at the maggot factory. They throw Phelim out and tell him never to return.  Marietta is worried about her mother and Hubert says that she will turn back into a woman when she serves her time. The film ends with the family at the pub with Hubert and Conchita, now a woman again, singing karaoke. It also shows a rat in the pub that has an earring like the one that Phelim wears.

Remember the Titans
  In July 1971, at the desegregated [[T. C. Williams High School]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], a black head coach, Herman Boone, is hired to coach  the school's football team. Boone is assigned to the coaching team under current coach Bill Yoast, nominated for the Virginia High School Hall of Fame. In an attempt to placate rising racial tensions and the fact that all other high schools are "white" only, Boone is assigned the head coach job. He refuses believing it is unfair to Yoast, but relents after seeing what it means to the black community. Yoast is then offered an assistant coach's job by the school board and initially refuses, but reconsiders after the white players pledge to boycott the team if he does not participate. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind and takes up the position of defensive coordinator under Boone.  The black students have a meeting in the gymnasium in auditioning to play for the team until Boone arrives, but the meeting turns into a fiasco when Yoast and white students interrupt. On August 15, 1971, the players gather and journey to [[Gettysburg College]], where their training camp takes place. As their days of training camp progress, black and white football team members frequently clash in racially motivated conflicts, including some between captains Gerry Bertier and Julius Campbell. But after forceful coaching and rigorous athletic training by Boone, which includes an early morning run to the Gettysburg cemetery, and a motivational speech, the team achieves racial harmony and success. After returning from football camp, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be dismissed. Subsequently, the Titans go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice, before slowly gaining support from the community. Gerry even has his best friend Ray removed from the team because of his racism, following a game where he intentionally missed a block which consequently led to the near-season-ending injury of starting quarterback Jerry "Rev" Harris.  Just before the state semi-finals, Yoast is told by the chairman of the school board that he will be inducted into the Hall of Fame after the Titans lose ''one'' game, implying he wants Boone to be dismissed over his race. During the game, it becomes apparent that the referees are biased against the Titans. Upon seeing the chairman and other board members in the audience looking on with satisfaction, Yoast realizes they've rigged the game and warns the head official that he will go to the press and expose the scandal unless the game is officiated fairly. The Titans nonetheless win and advance to the state championship, but Yoast is told by the chairman that his actions have resulted in his loss of candidacy for Hall of Fame induction.  While celebrating the victory, Bertier is severely injured in a car accident with a truck after driving through an intersection. Although Bertier is unable to play due to being paralyzed from the waist down, the team goes on to win the state championship. Bertier would remain a paraplegic for the rest of his life. Ten years later, Bertier dies in another automobile accident caused by a drunk driver, after winning the gold medal in [[shot put]] in the [[Paralympic Games]]. Coaches and other former teammates reunite to attend his funeral.  In the epilogue, descriptions show the players’ and coaches’ activities after the events in 1971.  
Red Planet (film)
 In 2056 A.D., [[Earth]] is in [[ecological crisis]] as a consequence of [[pollution]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]. Automated interplanetary missions have been seeding [[Mars]] with atmosphere-producing [[algae]] as the first stage of [[terraforming]] the planet. When the oxygen quantity produced by the algae is inexplicably reduced, the crew of ''Mars-1'' investigate—a crew consisting of Quinn Burchenal ([[Tom Sizemore]]), a geneticist; Bud Chantilas ([[Terence Stamp]]), an aging [[philosopher|philosophical]] scientist and surgeon; systems engineer Robby Gallagher ([[Val Kilmer]]); commander Kate Bowman ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]); pilot Ted Santen ([[Benjamin Bratt]]); and terraforming scientist Chip Pettengill ([[Simon Baker]]).  When ''Mars-1'' is damaged in arrival by a [[Gamma-ray burst]], Bowman remains aboard for repair while the others land to locate an automated habitat (HAB 1) established earlier to manufacture food and [[oxygen]]. During insertion, the team's landing craft is damaged and lands off-course. In the aftermath, "AMEE" (Autonomous Mapping Exploration and Evasion)—a military [[robot]] programmed to guide them—is lost, and Chantilas suffers a ruptured [[spleen]] and internal bleeding, and tells the others to leave him behind. Santen refuses, but Chantilas tells them that they have limited oxygen left to make it to HAB 1. Chantilas tells Gallagher that it is all right, as he got to see Mars for the first time. The crew leaves to allow Chantilas to die in peace. In orbit around Mars, Bowman contacts Houston, which informs her that ''Mars-1'' is in [[decaying orbit]], but offers hope of restoring engine function in departing Mars.  On Mars, the landing party find HAB 1 mysteriously destroyed. They are baffled for an explanation, since the module was designed and field-tested in [[Tornado Alley]] to withstand any damaging storms on Mars. All expect their imminent [[death]]s by [[suffocation]]. Pettengill and Santen wander from the others to explore, later to reach a [[canyon]] where Pettengill accidentally kills Santen, after they get into a fight over whether or not the mission was a failure, and that Pettengill realizes that Santen would never accept defeat. Pettengill returns to Burchenal and Gallagher, and tells them that Santen killed himself. His oxygen depleted, Gallagher opens his helmet, choosing a quick death over asphyxiation – and discovers that Mars' atmosphere is thin but breathable. The only salvageable material from the habitat is all of the liquid fuel, which has ruptured out of its containers but pooled under the wreck. With no remaining power in their suits, the astronauts set it on fire with a flare so they can have a bonfire to survive the massive temperature drop of the Martian night. AMEE reunites with the crew, and the three astronauts notice the robot is damaged and attempt to shut it down so they can recover its guidance device. Perceiving their actions as a threat, AMEE breaks Burchenal's ribs and pursues the others before retreating. Gallagher tells the others she has gone into military mode, and intends to kill them all one by one.  She wounded Burchenal instead of killing him because she has been programmed with knowledge of the old guerrilla tactic that a wounded man will slow the enemy down since effort must be expended to transport a wounded teammate.    Eventually, Gallagher builds a makeshift radio from parts of the [[Rover (space exploration)|Mars Rover]] ''[[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]'', through which Bowman instructs them to use a Russian [[Kosmos (satellite)|probe]]'s sample-return system to launch themselves into orbit. During the trip, Bowman tells Gallagher that the probe can hold only two people.  The trio takes shelter from an ice storm inside of a cave. Devastated by the recent news and afraid of being left behind, Pettengill flees with the radio, only to be killed by AMEE. After the storm subsides Gallagher and Burchenal recover the radio from Pettingill's corpse, and discover that it has become infested by insect-like native Martian life (identified by Burchenal as "[[nematodes]]"). The insects are highly flammable, as using a simple cutting torch on Pettengill's corpse to free his grip caused a chain reaction, making all of the insects in his corpse explode like firecrackers.  Later, the two encounter a field of [[algae]] being eaten by the insects, and Burchenal pieces together what happened.  The Martian insects had lain dormant on their almost dead world, but when the probes from Earth spread algae fields across Mars it gave them a massive new food source and led to a population explosion. The Martian insects are what caused the algae to disappear, but in the process they actually gave Mars breathable oxygen levels, because they produce oxygen as a waste product (explaining why they are so flammable). The insects are also what destroyed the habitat module, as they tore in to get to the food supplies inside.  Burchenal explains to Gallagher that the biochemistry of alien insects' [[Cellular respiration|respiratory metabolism]] is capable of producing oxygen far more efficiently than human science is currently able to. Studying the insects' biochemistry is the key to terraforming Mars, and may even lead to discoveries which will allow Earth's polluted atmosphere to be repaired. However, Burchenal is attacked by swarms of the insects when [[blood]] drips from an open wound. Rather than be eaten alive, he passes his sample vial of insects to Gallagher before [[self-immolation|immolating himself]] and his attackers.  Gallagher reaches the Russian probe, finds sufficient fuel to power the rocket's engine, but not enough electrical power to launch the probe, and realizes that the only available replacement is AMEE's power core. In a final confrontation, Gallagher is able to lure AMEE into a trap and disable her using one of the probe's sample launchers, then takes her battery. Gallagher launches himself in the probe's sample-return capsule and reaches orbit where ''Mars-1'' is waiting for him, and he is recovered and revived by Bowman. Gallagher becomes upset that four astronauts died so that he could live, but Bowman tells him that they did not die for nothing. The computer is busy analyzing the sample of Martian insects which Gallagher brought back, and research on them might lead to repairing Earth itself. With a six-month-long trip back to Earth, the computer has plenty of time to analyze the insects, and Bowman and Gallagher have time to start pursuing a romantic relationship.

Reindeer Games
 Nick Cassidy and Rudy Duncan are cellmates in prison two days away from release. Nick has been corresponding with a young woman named Ashley Mercer, who is waiting for him on the outside. After Nick takes a [[shiv (weapon)|shiv]] in a prison fight and dies, Rudy, who just wants to have a cup of hot chocolate after he reunites with his family a week before Christmas, takes his place and lets the beautiful Ashley think he is the one who has been writing her. Gabriel, the leader of a gang who assaults Rudy and Ashley in their cabin, is Ashley's brother, telling "Nick" that the gang, with Nick's help, will rob the casino he used to work at. Rudy reveals he is not Nick, but Ashley continues to confirm he is and that she wrote to him knowing Gabriel was going to kidnap and force Rudy to assist in the robbery. Rudy, while furious with Ashley, is reluctantly forced to go along with his ruse.  Using the information from the real Nick’s prison cell stories, Rudy is able to devise a robbery plan and informs Gabriel that the biggest loot is hidden inside a safe in the manager’s office (the "PowWow" safe). On the night of the robbery, Rudy breaks out of his holding in order to find a way to arm himself as he knows Gabriel will kill him after the robbery. He stumbles upon Gabriel and Ashley and learns that they are lovers and partners in crime.  The group robs the casino, each dressed as Santa Claus. Rudy, forced to take part in the robbery, hides the fact that he knows Ashley’s secret. Shots are fired and security guards and Santas are shot. Ashley drives into the Casino and lets Nick/Rudy know she is in on the heist. All meeting in the manager's office, Gabriel introduces Rudy to the casino manager as Nick but the manager recognizes that he isn’t Nick and Rudy confesses. Gabriel, furious at Rudy’s deception, spares him for a moment when he demands to know where the "PowWow” safe is. When the manager opens the safe, he grabs guns from inside and kills one of the robbers as the rest flee. The casino manager dies during the shootout. Rudy kills another one of the robbers and is then grabbed by Gabriel and Ashley who tie him up in their 18-wheeler truck.  They plan to drive him off the edge of a cliff in a burning vehicle with a little of the money so that officials will guess all had been burned. After accidentally revealing too much information during an argument with Rudy, Ashley shoots and kills the now suspicious Gabriel. Shortly after, Nick appears, having staged his death at the prison. It is revealed that Ashley's real name is Millie Bobeck and Rudy learns that the two had collaborated to rob the casino using Rudy and Gabriel and his gang. Ashley had known the entire time who Rudy truly was. Nick also informs Rudy that the prison stories were part of a set-up.  After they tie Rudy to the steering wheel to drive off the cliff, he produces a knife he had gotten earlier, cuts his bindings, hot wires the car, sets it to reverse and crushes Nick. With Ashley firing at him, he rams the fiery car into her and dives out as the car and Ashley go over the cliff. Nick tries to convince Rudy that they can share the money but Rudy locks him in the truck and also sends it over the cliff. Rudy picks up the stolen cash and begins distributing it in mailboxes he comes across on the way home to his family, and he eats a Christmas dinner with them. The film closes with Rudy smiling.  
Relative Values (film)
 There is unrest in the upper class Marshwood house as Nigel ([[Edward Atterton]]), the [[Earl]] of Marshwood, is engaged to a film actress, Miranda Frayle. However, many disapprove because this would mean Nigel would be marrying below his class.  When Nigel brings Miranda home to the Marshwood estate to meet his family, Lady Marshwood's ([[Julie Andrews]]) maid Moxie ([[Sophie Thompson]]) reveals that Miranda is her sister; they devise a charade so that Moxie may meet her sister as an equal. However, when Miranda lies about her past (stating she's a [[cockney]] and that Moxie was a drunk and is now dead), Moxie finds it harder and harder to hide her identity. Meanwhile, Miranda's ex-boyfriend and fellow film star Don Lucas ([[William Baldwin]]) arrives, wanting Miranda back.  
Red Dirt (film)
  The film centers on Griffith ([[Dan Montgomery, Jr.]]) who has lived all his life in the fictional town of Pine Apple, Mississippi. He spends most of his time barefoot on the red dirt and has a hobby of tracing the [[epitaph]]s on [[headstone]]s. He was orphaned as a child when his parents drowned inside their car in the river under mysterious circumstances. He was raised by his eccentric Aunt Summer ([[Karen Black]]) and his Uncle Charlie.  Summer is mentally unstable and agoraphobic, apparently a result of the death of Griffith's parents. She and her only other living sister, Lynn Thomas ([[Peg O'Keef]]), have avoided each other for years for unknown reasons. Charlie (who died of cancer when Griffith was 14) once regularly sent Summer off to a mental asylum, being unable to deal with her eccentric behavior. She resumed living in the house after Charlie's death, cared for by Griffith and the family matriarch, Lily Mae.  Griffith's only other close relationship is with Lynn's daughter, his first cousin Emily ([[Aleksa Palladino]]), with whom he also has occasional sexual relationships.  The film is set shortly after the death of Lily Mae, when Griffith becomes solely responsible for caring for his aunt. Griffith resents this, feeling trapped in his environment and longing to leave.  Emily does not want him to leave. She accuses Griffith of wanting to abandon her and his responsibilities to Aunt Summer. Emily herself has no wish to leave Pine Apple, even though her own mother practically pushes her to.  Griffith is nevertheless determined to leave. He starts cleaning up the cottage previously used by Lily Mae with the intention of renting it out. A day after he hangs the 'For Rent' sign, a stranger from Louisiana arrives and inquires about the cottage. He introduces himself as Lee Todd ([[Walton Goggins]]). Griffith agrees to let Lee stay in the cottage for free in return for helping him finish painting it, despite the objections of both Summer and Emily.  The two quickly become friends. They paint a barn roof with Emily's name and phone number and they start building a giant replica of a pincushion in memory of Lily Mae. Griffith is intrigued by Lee's experiences during his travels. Lee, in turn, urges Griffith to leave Pine Apple and see the world. He offers to take Griffith with him. Griffith agrees and they make a [[blood brother|blood oath]].  Emily senses the growing closeness between the two. Feeling left out, she starts spending time with Summer. The two develop an unlikely friendship. Summer sees herself in Emily, senses her doubts and her repressed desire to leave. She also urges Emily to leave Pine Apple, but Emily dismisses this. Emily also voices her suspicions to Summer that Griffith and Lee were becoming more than friends. Summer admits to having the same suspicions but does not want to interfere, believing that she had already stood in Griffith's way enough.  Emily confronts Lee and tries to convince him to leave Griffith alone. Lee refuses, telling her that he believes it's best for Griffith to leave Pine Apple.  Summer thrives in the company of Emily, who convinces her to finally get out of the house and try to get over her agoraphobia. Driving out on country roads, they chance upon Lee and Griffith, who have just finished building the replica of Lily Mae's pincushion in the middle of a field. The sight of it finally triggers closure on Summer's part, setting her on the path to recovery.  While bathing in the river that afternoon, Lee tells Griffith that they should be leaving soon for Texas. Griffith agrees but asks for one more week to prepare. That night, Griffith asks permission from Summer to leave. Summer encourages him. She asks him not to worry about her but she also betrays guilt over Griffith's childhood, something Griffith can still not understand.  Emily catches Lee putting away stuff for storage and learns that Lee and Griffith are leaving together. She confronts Griffith and confesses that she loves him, the reason she didn't want to leave. Griffith tells her it isn't enough anymore and that he has to leave.  Summer asks Emily to drive her to her sister. During their conversation the reasons for their alienation became clear. The death of Griffith's parents was not an accident. Summer had been having an affair with her late sister's husband and Griffith is actually Summer's son. Although Summer gave him up to her sister (who couldn't conceive), it didn't prevent the eventual breakdown of her sister's marriage. They gave Griffith back to Summer and committed suicide by driving off a bridge. Lynn blames Summer for their sister's death. Summer is wracked by guilt over it but is still thankful that she got to take care of Griffith after all.  Meanwhile, Emily confronts Griffith for the final time, openly accusing him of being gay. Griffith becomes angry and unthinkingly tries to rape her in an attempt to prove his heterosexuality. He stops himself in time and runs away into the rain. Griffith finds Lee and accuses him of lying to him about his intentions. Lee tells him what has been obvious, that deep inside Griffith knew that it was already something more than friendship. Griffith denies it vehemently and punches Lee when he tries to kiss him. Griffith goes home and shuts himself in his room.  The following day, Lee visits Emily to say goodbye. He finds Emily packing her things. She has decided to leave Pine Apple for New Orleans. They finally admit to each other that they both love Griffith. Before Lee leaves, Emily assures him that Griffith does love him.  After Lee has left town, Summer finally admits to Griffith that she is his real mother. Griffith is initially incredulous but eventually believes her. In doing so, he finally realizes he doesn't need to run away after all, that he actually belongs to Pine Apple. He sets fire to the giant pincushion, which was to him a symbol of his desire to leave. He also makes up with Emily before she leaves for New Orleans, after bidding a tearful goodbye to Summer.  Lee unexpectedly returns shortly after. Griffith receives him warmly but they carefully avoid the subject of their previous fight. As Lee is turning away to leave for the final time, Griffith finally gets the courage to admit that he loves him back and kisses him. Lee drives him back to Summer's house.  Griffith opts to remain in Pine Apple with Summer. He and Lee read a poem inscribed on Lily Mae's headstone to each other and part with the implication of keeping in touch.  : ''Forever and a day and the blood of man, stained red the dirt of the Mississippi land. And in this journey we go, but in this place we’ll stay. If only in the heart, where memory of love, eternally remains.''

The Replacements (film)
 A fictional pro football league finds themselves hit with a players' strike with the season still needing to be finished. Washington Sentinels<ref></ref><ref></ref> owner Edward O'Neil calls a former coach of his, Jimmy McGinty, telling McGinty that he and the rest of the teams are going to finish the final four games of the season with replacement players. O'Neil asks McGinty to coach the Sentinels the rest of the season, along with the pressure of winning three of the last four games to make the playoffs. McGinty accepts, on the condition that he will also be given the freedom to sign the players he wants with O'Neil not allowed to interfere.  With O'Neil accepting his requests, McGinty builds his team of different varying players that he believes can make a winning team. As his quarterback, McGinty chooses Shane Falco, a former [[All-American]] from [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] whose career went to pieces after a horrendous Sugar Bowl game, and now lives in a houseboat near the Sentinels' stadium. Falco initially refuses, but McGinty convinces him, believing that Falco can still be the player he was meant to be. The replacement players are greeted to their first practice hostilely by the striking players, calling the replacements "scabs", and throwing eggs at them, and Falco, who arrives late, gets his truck turned over. Head cheerleader Annabelle Ferrell, who has to find new cheerleaders since the originals apparently went on strike as well, reluctantly hires strippers when the other tryouts go terribly bad. After practice, Annabelle drives Falco home and surprises him with her vast football knowledge.  The replacements' first game is against Detroit, and the team initially struggles to get along, causing the Sentinels to fall behind early. Falco tries to rally the team back, but on the last play, he panics when he sees a pending blitz and calls an audible, which falls short of the winning touchdown. McGinty berates Falco for what he did, telling him that "winners always want the ball when the game's on the line." At a local bar, several of the replacements lament over their loss, when several of the striking players, led by their prima donna quarterback Eddie Martel, arrive and taunt the replacements. When Falco stands up to Martel, a brawl follows, leading to the replacements being arrested, but they build a bond in the process, dancing together in their cell before McGinity bails them out. Annabelle meets Shane the next day, having heard what happened, and tells him that he's the first quarterback she's seen in a long time be so selfless, and a connection starts to grow with the two of them.  In the Sentinels' next game against San Diego, they fall behind again but are able to come together once again, and this time win, on a 65-yard field goal by their kicker, a Welsh soccer player named Nigel Gruff. Falco meets Annabelle again, where she runs a bar her father used to own and admits that she was raised with football. After sharing a short conversation and having a beer together, they consummate their feelings for one another, sharing a deep kiss. The Sentinels nearly lose their next game on the road against Phoenix, but win on a couple of improbable plays.  When the Sentinels return to DC, O'Neil tells McGinty that Eddie Martel has crossed the [[Picketing (protest)|picket line]], and points out that the entire team of the league's defending champions, and the Sentinels' next opponent, Dallas, have crossed as well. O'Neil shows no confidence in Falco being able to beat Dallas, and hints to McGinity that he could be fired if McGinty refuses to start Martel. McGinty gives in and reluctantly tells Falco, who then tells his teammates the same thing, demoralizing the team. Falco is toasted by his teammates, but unable to face Annabelle after what happened, Falco leaves her stood up for their planned date.  In the first half of the final crucial game, Martel clashes severely with the replacement players, and also smugly ignores any play calls McGinty makes, causing the Sentinels fall behind to Dallas 17–0. The hometown fans, who had initially despised the replacements, now boo Martel, having accepted Falco as their favorite. On the way to the locker room for halftime, McGinty tells a TV reporter that the team needs "heart" to come back and win, something he had earlier said Falco had. Falco, watching this on television, returns to the stadium, and McGinty promptly benches Martel for Falco. Martel angrily tells Falco that he will never be known as anything but a replacement player. Falco says he can live with that and the rest of the team throws Martel out of the stadium. On his way back to the field, Falco finds Annabelle and apologizes to her, giving her another deep kiss in front of the crowd and other cheerleaders.  McGinty tells the replacements that the strike will officially end the next day, giving the players incentive to give everything they have left. The Sentinels rally back to a 17-14 score, with Gruff being called to kick the game-tying field goal late in the game. However, Gruff spots bookies that he owes money to in the crowd, and realizes that they want him to throw the game or they'll take his pub from him as compensation. He hints this to Falco just before the kick, and Falco pulls the ball away, causing Gruff to fall from the momentum of his kicking motion and break his arm. Falco initially scores the apparent winning touchdown, but it's called back on a Sentinels penalty. With Gruff unable to continue, Falco tells McGinty that he "wants the ball", affirming what McGinty had told him before. Falco calls for a deep pass to the replacements' deaf tight end, Brian Murphy, and hits him with the game-winning touchdown pass as time expires, earning the Sentinels a playoff berth. Falco celebrates with Annabelle, while McGinty narrates that the replacement players left the field with nothing but the satisfaction and personal glory of what they've accomplished, which is living the athlete's dream of a "second chance." He then watches the replacements dance on the field to the [[Gloria Gaynor]] song "[[I Will Survive]]".  
Restless (2000 film)
 The film is about Ari ([[Mikko Nousiainen]]), a 27-year-old [[ambulance]] [[Physician|doctor]] with a terminally ill mother. [[One-night stand]]s are his main pastime. He doesn't want to meet any of the girls again because he is certain that commitment equals pain. But one day Ari realises that he can't feel anything at all. Then he meets a woman named Tiina ([[Laura Malmivaara]]) on the beach.  That same day they have sex in Ari's apartment and Tiina enters her phone number into Ari's in order to exchange contact details. At first Ari ignores Tiina's attempts to phone him to the amusement of his married colleague, Roope.  Ari subsequently relents and they start dating each other reaching the point where Tiina, falling in love, begins to look for commitment. However, on Ari's birthday when Tiina brings him a cake to his apartment she arrives as another woman is leaving.  Nonetheless she decides to maintain the [[Social relationship|relationship]] with him though expressing her desire for exclusivity.  Ari is later introduced to Tiina's friends who include two other couples, Ilona an archaeologist who is dating Stig and Hanna-Riikka a priest who is dating and living with Riku.  This introduction takes place as the five pre-existing companions sail to an island to celebrate the [[Mid-Summer Festival]]. During this holiday the six have a conversation in which Hanna-Riikka states that man is nothing without [[belief]] to which Ari immediately responds: "Then that must mean I am an [[ape]]." The others laugh and Hanna-Riikka walks out. Ilona shows a clear interest in Ari and later initiates a sexual encounter with him.  This affair continues for an unspecified length of time during which Ari and Tiina move in together and Hanna-Riikka confronts Ari with her suspicions of what's happening between him and Ilona. When these are confirmed Hanna-Rikka also confronts Ilona about her behaviour and is accused of being a hypocritical lesbian. When the Ilona and Ari decide to have one last episode of intercourse they are discovered by Stig who tells Tiina about the affair and Ari moves out. Riku offers him use of his couch much to Hanna-Riikka's displeasure. Meanwhile, Tiina discovers that she is pregnant and later gets a commitment from Ari to resume the relationship with the aim of being a responsible father to their child.  Late one night Ari is called to Roope's house because his heavy drinking has precipitated the breakdown of his marriage to Piia.  Ari arrives to find Roope with a bottle of spirits and his revolver.  After Roope tells him about the fallout of his [[alcoholism]], Ari says that Piia is actually outside sulking in the front garden.  Roope asks Ari to talk to his wife because he considers Ari more knowledgeable about how to talk to women and gives Ari his revolver to prevent him from killing himself. Later, when Ari goes to his old apartment Tiina tells him that the hospital has called to inform him of his mother's death.  The pair attends the funeral together.  Then the film progresses to Tiina and Ilona reconciling, as do Ari and Stig who asks Ari to be his best man as the affair with Ilona apparently helped clarify Stig's perspective of the relationship to the point where [[marriage]] appeared feasible. The wedding is to be officiated by Hanna-Riikka, who by now has separated from Riku, and to be held on the island where the six earlier holidayed. During one of the drinking games they usually engage in, Hanna-Rikka states that she has never climaxed during sexual intercourse prompting Riku to walk out and the two are later seen arguing. At the reception Ari, in deep contemplation, tells Tiina that they need to talk. Once they are alone Ari states "What are we going to do?" to which Tiina again questions the commitment of Ari by arguing that they should get married. Ari opposes her and says that they should separate. To this, Tiina is shocked, so she proceeds to drink excessively at the wedding prompting Ilona to try stop her. Tiina ends up revealing to the groom that Ari has, in fact, only recently slept with the bride and also the priest. This leads to a confrontation with Ari using the butt of Roope's former revolver to knock both Stig and Riku to the ground and he leaves the reception.  The film ends with narrating Ari's thoughts as he gets away from it all by physically distancing himself by travelling, Tiina has given birth, Ilona is lecturing while Stig and Riku have maintained their friendship. In the last scene Ari returns to a church where Hanna-Riikka is working.

Meanwhile, her son Harry occasionally pawns her television set to fund his, his girlfriend Marion's, and his best friend Tyrone's drug use.  After Sara receives a call that she has won a spot on a television game show, she becomes excited about attending it. To fit back into her red dress, the favorite of her deceased husband Seymour's, she attempts to lose weight through unsuccessful diets. At the recommendation of a friend, she visits an unscrupulous physician who prescribes her a regimen of weight-loss amphetamines. She begins losing weight, and is excited by how much energy she has.

Harry and Marion plan to open up a dress shop for Marion's designs, and Tyrone dreams of escaping the ghetto to make his mother proud. Sara and her friends wait expectantly every day for the game show invitation to arrive. With the extra money, Harry stops by to tell his mother he ordered her a new television set, but when he implores her to get off the amphetamines, she confesses that the only thing she has to live for anymore is the dream of looking glamorous on a television stage, and the extra attention she receives now from her friends.

Return to Cabin by the Lake
 Two years after being presumed dead, Stanley Caldwell (under the alias of "Alan") meets with an agent named Lauren on a boat to discuss a new screenplay.  They soon learn that despite public protest, director Mike Helton has begun principal photography on ''Cabin by the Lake'', a film based on Stanley's old screenplay detailing his exploits as a serial killer.  Amongst the protesters is Paul Parsons, the brother of Kimberly Parsons who was one of Stanley's last victims.  Stanley confronts Lauren about the news, who claims that his original script was a nightmare and had thus hired Alison Gaddis to rewrite it.  Insulted, Stanley binds her with a long strand of ivy rooted in a cement flower pot while telling her about his "dream project" called ''Cabin by the Lake''.  A horrified Lauren realizes Alan's true identity and desperately suggests that he become a director.  Stanley is intrigued by the idea, but nevertheless pushes her overboard to drown.  On the set of the film, Paul Parsons confronts Mike Helton and demands that he cease the production, but is dragged away by security.  Stanley then arrives on the scene with a new disguise, claiming that he owns the cabin where the film is being shot, in fact the actual cabin where he had lived two years prior.  While wandering the set, he bumps into writer Alison Gaddis, who praises Stanley's work and is curious about all aspects of his background.  Helton receives a call from JC Reddick, the producer's nephew and second unit director whom no one has ever met.  Helton tells him he will send a plane for him at the airport.  Sensing an opportunity, Stanley leaves the set and races to the airport while donning a new disguise.  At the airport, Stanley fools the driver sent to wait for JC and retrieves JC himself.  He then drugs JC and attempts to drown him in the lake, but JC unties himself and tries to escape, leading Stanley to run him down with his boat motor instead.  Posing as JC, Stanley returns to the set and once again runs into Alison.  He claims to be an acquaintance of Stanley and gives her several details about his modus operandi and preference for strong women as victims.  She explains her fascination with Stanley as a film student and invites him out for coffee at a later date, which Stanley accepts.  Helton unveils the indoor set for ''Cabin by the Lake'': An enormous water tank eerily similar to Stanley's original "garden", complete with mannequins in various stages of decay.  Tasked with shooting the underwater scenes, Stanley dons scuba gear and dives into the tank to tend his garden, infuriating Helton by ignoring his stage directions.  Later, Stanley and Alison finally meet to discuss Stanley more in depth.  When she mentions Kimberly Parsons, Stanley goes into a trance as he describes how she had fought the hardest of all his victims, remembering vividly how she had scratched and clawed him.  When Alison returns to the tank alone to continue writing, she is ambushed by an unknown person.  Helton believes that Paul Parsons is responsible, in an effort to sabotage the production.  Helton then discovers that Stanley has made changes to the script without his knowledge, further angering him.  In turn, Stanley drugs Helton and takes him back to the cabin where he buries him alive, using fireworks to cover his panicked screams.  Stanley takes over as director, micromanaging every aspect of the film according to his personal vision.  At the lake, Paul confronts Alison about her part in the production.  He apologizes for scaring her at the tank and invites her to meet with him at the bar to discuss his sister.  Paul gives details of Kimberly's death that eerily correspond with those from Stanley himself, rousing her suspicions.  When she confronts Stanley, he gives her a drugged glass of wine that renders her unconscious.  She awakens in Stanley's cabin basement, chained to the floor by her ankle just like all his previous victims.  As he greets her with food, the scars on his forearm confirm his identity.    Paul repeatedly calls the set looking for Alison, but is told that she finished rewriting the script and went home.  Stanley then falsely informs Paul that he is planning to scrap the production and invites Paul to meet him at the stage that night.  Stanley directs the final shot of the movie, but secretly rigs a light fixture to fall into the tank and electrocute the actress inside.  When Paul arrives on set just afterwards, Stanley frames him for the incident and sends him fleeing.  Stanley coerces the actors playing Mallory and Boone to come back to the set for one final shot, then returns to the cabin where a defiant Alison manipulates him into bringing her to the stage.  Alison tries to warn the two actors that Stanley is planning to kill them, but they dismiss her words as a joke.  While looking for Alison, Paul visits the cabin and discovers she was abducted by Stanley.    Holding them at gunpoint, Stanley carries out his plan to drown Mallory's actress.  As the actor playing Boone struggles to free her, Alison pushes Stanley off the platform before shooting the tank with Stanley's gun, flooding the stage.  Paul arrives to help, but Alison is recaptured by Stanley and forced into his car.  While driving, Alison deliberately crashes the car and escapes, but Stanley recovers and pursues her back to the cabin.  Stanley finds her hiding in the bathroom, but Alison strikes him with a towel rack and knocks him into a bathtub full of water.  After a brief standoff, she throws a hair dryer into the tub and electrocutes him.  The police arrive with Paul but a search of the cabin yields no sign of Stanley.  They find his boat on the lake, and Alison finds a watch he had stolen from JC on the dock.  The police decide they will drag the lake tomorrow and try to reassure Alison that Stanley is dead.  The film closes with a report stating that ''Cabin by the Lake'' was a surprise hit in its opening weekend, earning $36 million at the box office with a sequel already in the works.  Alison and Paul have since started a relationship, but Alison still has nightmares about Stanley, who is shown reading the newspaper article about the film's success.  
Ri Kōran (film)
 The film follows Ri Koran's life from childhood to adulthood, portraying her tragic identity crisis and internal cross-cultural conflict. Born as Yamaguchi Yoshiko in 1920 to well-educated Japanese expatriates in increasingly Japanese-dominated [[Northeast China|northeastern China]], she was raised in a multiethnic, transnational social circle consisting of various Chinese, Japanese and European acquaintances, many of whom hail from an intellectual or artistic background. The film details her friendship with Lyuba, the daughter of a Russian aristocratic family exiled by the [[Russian Revolution]] and learned music from the Italian [[soprano]] Madam Podresov, who was married into exiled [[Russian aristocracy]].   Her father was an expert in [[Chinese history]] and [[Chinese literature|literature]], and belonged to a group of [[Transnationalism|transnational]] Japanese intellectuals who wanted to build a [[Pan-Asianism|pan-Asian]] [[utopia]] through [[China-Japan relations|Sino-Japanese cooperation]]. While her family was very fond and close to Chinese culture, as a child, she witnesses the brutalities of [[Japanese colonialism]] and [[Japanese imperialism|imperialism]] against Chinese people firsthand, epitomized in a violent scene where her friendly Chinese neighbour was tied to a tree and bloodily beaten by Japanese soldiers for suspected [[anti-Japanese]] activities. These traumatic episodes cause her to internalize her Japanese heritage as a marker of oppression, inducing guilt in the young child.   In 1931, Japan invades northeastern China and establishes the pro-Japanese puppet state [[Manchukuo]]. At this time, Yoshiko was enrolled in a Beijing high school under the Chinese name Pan Shuhua, and was assumed to be Chinese by most of her peers. At a student gathering passionately denouncing Japanese aggression, Yoshiko was asked what she would do if Japanese troops reached Beijing. She replies, "I want to stand atop Beijing's city walls and have bullets pierce through my body." Her classmates enthusiastically applaud her, assuming she meant she would use her own body to defend Beijing against Japanese invasion. However, as visually represented through a fiery dream sequence where Chinese and Japanese bullets shatter her from both sides, she was really expressing her helplessness in being caught in the crossfires of two nations she loved dearly.   As she blossoms into a beautiful young lady, the [[Manchukuo Film Association]], or Man'ei for short, recruits her, and she swiftly rises to fame as a popular singer and film actress. She uses the Chinese name Li Xianglan or its Japanese pronunciation equivalent Ri Koran as her stage name during the Manchukuo era. However, in that highly politicized era, becoming a pop cultural icon entailed becoming a propaganda tool for powerful forces beyond Ri Koran's control. Ri Koran starred in many Man'ei films that promoted Manchukuo's official ideology and multiethnic unity policy. Ri's rise to fame was one of the most successful projects that sought to embody the theme of ethnic harmony in Man'ei films. She represented the pan-Asian imaginary rather than a fixed singular ethnic figure, typically involving a non-Japanese female character falling in love with a Japanese male. She was named the "Goodwill Ambassador for Manchukuo-Japanese Friendship," a title she cherished and truly believed in. However, even as a renowned celebrity, she faced racism; on a trip to Japan, Ri Koran was dressed in a [[qipao]], and was stopped by a [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese soldier]]. Upon checking her papers, the soldier angrily reprimanded and insulted her, shouting that a superior Japanese should not wear the fashion of the inferior races. These episodes slowly made Ri Koran realize the hypocrisy of the official rhetoric, and she feels guilty of representing propaganda characters.  The war draws to a close with Japan's defeat and the collapse of Manchukuo. Ri Koran was tried as a treasonous [[Hanjian|Chinese war criminal]], but upon the Chinese authorities' realization that she is ethnically Japanese, she is deported to Japan. The film fast forwards to the twenty-first century, when [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and China|Sino-Japanese relations have normalized]], and Ri Koran is able to revisit the land of her childhood, now with the name Otaka Yoshiko, which she acquired through marriage to diplomat Otaka Hiroshi. In a cemetery, she runs into her childhood friend Lyuba, and the film closes with the two having an emotional reunion.

After their con is exposed, the two evade the guards and hide aboard one of the ships to be led by [[Hernán Cortés]] for the [[New World]]. During the voyage, they are caught as stowaways and imprisoned, but break free and take a rowboat with the help of Cortés' horse, Altivo.  They reach an unknown shore at the edge of [[Guatemala]], where Miguel begins to recognize landmarks from the map, leading them to a totem marker near a waterfall that Tulio believes is a dead end. As they prepare to leave, they encounter a native woman, Chel, being chased by guards. When the guards see Tulio and Miguel riding Altivo as depicted on the totem, they escort them and Chel to a secret entrance behind the falls, into El Dorado. They are brought to the city's elders, kindhearted Chief Tannabok and wicked high priest Tzekel-Kan. The pair are mistaken for gods and given luxurious quarters, along with the charge of Chel. Chel discovers the two are conning the people but promises to remain quiet if they take her with them when they leave the city. The two are showered with gifts of gold from Tannabok, but disapprove of Tzekel-Kan attempting to sacrifice a civilian as the gods' ritual.  Tulio instructs Tannabok to build them a boat so that they can leave the city with all the gifts they have been given. During the three days this will take, Miguel explores the city, and Chel gets romantically close to Tulio. Miguel comes to appreciate the peaceful life the citizens seem to enjoy. When Tzekel-Kan sees Miguel playing [[Mesoamerican ballgame|a ball game]] with children, he insists the gods demonstrate their powers against the city's best players in the same game. Tulio and Miguel are far outmatched, but Chel is able to substitute the ball with an armadillo, allowing them to win. Miguel spares the ritual of sacrificing the losing team and chastises Tzekel-Kan, much to the crowd's approval. Tzekel-Kan notices Miguel received a small cut and realizes the two are not gods, because gods do not bleed. Tzekel-Kan conjures a giant stone [[jaguar]] to chase them through the city. Tulio and Miguel outwit the jaguar, causing it and Tzekel-Kan to fall into a giant whirlpool, thought to be the entrance to Xibalba. Tzekel-Kan then surfaces in the jungle, where he encounters Cortés and his men. Thinking Cortés is a god, he offers to lead them to El Dorado.  With the boat completed, Miguel says he will stay in the city. As Tulio and Chel board the boat, they see smoke on the horizon and realize Cortés is close. Tulio suggests using the boat to ram rock pillars under the waterfall and block the main entrance to the city. The plan succeeds with the citizens pulling over a statue in the boat's wake to give it enough speed. As the statue starts to fall too quickly, Tulio has difficulty in preparing the boat's sail. Giving up on staying in the city, Miguel and Altivo jump onto the boat to unfurl the sails, assuring the boat clears the statue in time. The group successfully crashes against the pillars, causing a cave-in but losing all their gifts in the process. They hide near the totem, just as Cortés' men and Tzekel-Kan arrive. When Tzekel-Kan finds the entrance blocked, Cortés brands him a liar, and takes Tzekel-Kan prisoner as they leave.  Tulio and Miguel, though disappointed they lost the gold (unaware that Altivo still wears the golden horseshoes with which he was outfitted in El Dorado), head in a different direction for a new adventure with Chel.

Road Trip (film)
 Josh Parker and Tiffany Henderson are childhood friends who became high school sweethearts, but had to deal with a long-distance relationship when Josh enrolls at the (fictional) University of Ithaca and Tiffany enrolls at the (fictional) University of Austin, promising continued fidelity to one another. Eventually, when Josh loses touch with Tiffany, Josh believes Tiffany might be seeing other people. Nonetheless, he makes a daily recorded video blog to her. Josh asks Rubin to mail his blog tape to Tiffany before leaving for class.  In class, Josh is failing [[Ancient Philosophy]] and the professor informs him he needs a B+ on his mid-term to pass the semester, and furthermore, to re-enroll. Still worrying about Tiffany, Josh's best friend E.L. Faldt convinces him to accept his friend Beth Wagner, who has a loving attraction for Josh. Jacob, the [[Teaching assistant|T.A.]] of Philosophy, has an obsessive crush on Beth and is jealous of Josh, aware of Beth's feelings for him. During E.L.'s party, Josh attends and E.L. holds an auction of several women, including Beth. Jacob also attends the party, and Beth, scared of Jacob, convinces Josh to outbid Jacob. They quickly escape to Josh's room, and videotape their intercourse with Josh's blog recorder.     The next morning, Josh arrives in the room in a very jovial mood, confessing that he slept with Beth. His friends play his tape but Josh discovers that Rubin accidentally mailed the sex tape to Tiffany, having confused it with Josh's blog tape for Tiffany. Josh then receives a voicemail from Tiffany saying that she didn't call him because her grandfather had died and she will be away from school until Monday. Accompanied by E.L. and Rubin, Josh asks Kyle to tag along, mainly because he needs Kyle's car. Kyle is a [[Shyness|shy]] loner who lives in constant fear of his overly strict father, Earl Edwards, the rightful owner of their car. The group heads out to drive the nearly  to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and back in three days and leave Barry to take care of Mitch, their pet [[snake]].     When they reach Pennsylvania, taking a supposed "shortcut", they come upon a small collapsed bridge and are annoyed that they will waste 5 hours back tracking. E.L. and Rubin convince the other two that they could jump the gap, ''[[:wikt:à la|à la]]'' [[Evel Knievel]]. Kyle objects but they proceed. They make it across, but the car is effectively destroyed upon landing when the wheels fall off. They get out and discuss what to do next, and the car explodes. So, they continue on foot and stop at a motel. Rubin tries to score [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] off the eccentric, unsympathetic motel clerk and is informed that Kyle's credit card is maxed out. E.L. looks for transportation, and talks an otherwise rather savvy [[Visual impairment|blind]] woman, Brenda, who works for a local school for the blind, into letting him take a bus away to be repaired. The guys hit the road again.     Meanwhile, Kyle's father, Earl, tries to pay for a meal with the maxed out card, but is denied service.  He then begins an all-out search for Kyle when he is informed by the police that Kyle's car was found blown up and Kyle is missing. On their way to Austin, the group goes through a series of misadventures, such as two of them making deposits at a [[sperm bank]] to raise needed funds; Rubin successfully lying his way into letting the group stay overnight at a [[fraternity house]] full of African-Americans at the [[University of Tennessee]], where the members pull a prank on Kyle, which causes him to faint; and a wild visit with Barry's grandparents. Since Josh's books were destroyed in the exploded car, he calls his professor to ask for an extension on his midterm exam. Jacob answers the phone, impersonating the professor, and grants a fake extension.     While Barry is trying to feed Mitch, Beth comes back to the room inquiring of Josh's whereabouts; Barry informs her that Josh has feelings for her.  Jacob walks in and informs Beth that he tricked Josh about the mid-term extension, and that he is about to fail Philosophy.  Mitch bites Barry in the hand, causing a vicious struggle which ends with Mitch landing on Jacob, biting his neck, and making him lose consciousness.     The group finally gets to Austin and, once they get to Tiffany's dorm, Josh eventually intercepts the tape he sent to Tiffany, who has just arrived back at school. But Earl shows up, furious over what happened with the car and the credit card and threatens to drag Kyle back home with him. Kyle finally summons the confidence to stand up to him and states that he is going back to school with his friends. Earl assaults him and confusion reigns in an all-out mini-riot in the dorm's lobby. Josh and Tiffany retreat and discuss their relationship, but Beth calls to warn Josh that he has been tricked by Jacob, and while Josh talks to her, Tiffany starts to watch the tape, which turns out to be nothing but Barry mooning for the camera. Josh now has 48 hours to get back to school or else he will fail his midterm and the course, and, possibly, be kicked out of college. After they talk, Josh and Tiffany agree to break up but remain friends. Josh and his friends head back to school and Josh arrives just in time to take his midterm – with a little, albeit illegal, help from Beth.     Barry closes the film, ending the visitors' tour by confirming to them that Josh passed the course, that Josh and Beth are still together, a happy couple still making videos, that Jacob eventually became a leader of a cult and tried to stage a mass suicide but only he ended up doing so, that Rubin became a successful marijuana cultivator, and lastly relates humorous facts about E.L.'s and Kyle's futures.  
Rip Girls
 Sydney Miller is a 13-year-old girl who was born in Hawaii and moved away at a young age after the death of her mother, who she barely remembers. From her great aunt, Sydney inherits a derelict Hawaiian [[plantation]] that had been used through five generations. Sydney, her father Ben, and her stepmother Elizabeth leave their residence in Chicago to visit the plantation, known as Makai. When the Millers arrive, they meet attorney Bo Kauihou, who informs them that Sydney will inherit the plantation if she stays there for two weeks. Bo attempts to dissuade Sydney's parents from selling the plantation, stating that the ground is still fertile enough for use as farm land, although Ben is hesitant as he and Elizabeth have no farm experience. Although Bo wants to preserve the plantation, he informs the Millers that there have been inquiries about purchasing the property.  At the plantation, Sydney finds an old photograph of her mother and learns that she used to surf. The next day, Sydney finds a surfboard with the word "Naniloa" inscribed on it, then befriends a girl named Gia, who enjoys surfing. That night, Sydney tells her parents that she wants to spend time with Gia at a beach on the following day. Ben is apprehensive about Sydney going to the beach alone, but allows her to do so when she promises to just take pictures, without going near the water. While Ben, Elizabeth, and Bo meet with realtors, Sydney arrives at the beach with the Naniloa surfboard. Sydney is introduced to Gia's friends, including Kona, a boy who is an artist and skateboarder. Sydney confesses that she does not know how to surf, so Gia teaches her.  Later, Bo and the Millers meet with the realtors to discuss a company's plans to construct a resort on the plantation property. Sydney is disappointed that the plans do not include the preservation of the plantation buildings, which were built in 1912; the realtors suggest that the main plantation house could be converted into a restaurant. They also tell Sydney that everything is negotiable after she expresses disappointment at the company's plan to make the nearby beach available to hotel guests only.  While surfing, Sydney is swept off her surfboard and rescued by Kona. Sydney has a cut on her face and later awakens in a beach house belonging to Gia's mother, Malia, who has bandaged her cut. Malia tells Sydney that the Naniloa surfboard belonged to Sydney's mother, who was nicknamed Naniloa. Malia also says that she was friends with Sydney's mother. Malia is surprised to learn that Ben never mentioned the friendship. Malia then takes Sydney to a lagoon to observe its beauty; Malia tells her that it is a place where whales gather annually. Malia brings Sydney back to the plantation, and Ben becomes upset at Malia, believing that she encouraged Sydney to surf. Malia questions Ben's decision to withhold information from Sydney regarding her mother; he tells Malia that he was trying to keep Sydney away from Hawaii and surfing in order to protect her, an idea with which Malia disagrees.  The next day, Sydney learns – from Gia – that her mother died in an accident. Sydney says her father has never discussed her mother's death and she has never asked him about it. Sydney has Kona and Gia take her to Kaala Loa, a vacant plantation, where she discovers her mother's old bedroom. The Millers receive a new monetary offer for Makai, and Sydney is left to choose whether to accept it. That night, a party is held at Kaala Loa, where Sydney and Kona share a kiss. While observing the whales, Sydney learns from Malia that her mother died while surfing.  Gia's friends ignore Sydney after a newspaper article states that the plantation and beach will be sold to the company, even though she has not yet made a decision. When Sydney tells Gia that the company has promised to preserve the lagoon for the whales, Gia tells her that the animals will no longer arrive with tourists around. Gia admits that initially, she only befriended Sydney so she could convince her to keep the plantation and beach, but she says that their friendship is authentic, which Sydney does not believe. After arguing, Sydney decides to sell the property. When Sydney is ready to sign the paperwork, she notices Gia's friends outside and decides not to sell, choosing instead to live at Makai. Sydney and Gia become friends again.  
The Road Home (1999 film)
 ''The Road Home'' is the story of a country girl and a young teacher falling in love, and the teacher's death many years later that brings their son back from the big city for the funeral.  The film begins in black and white in present-day China when the son ([[Sun Honglei]]) returns to his village from the city upon hearing of his father's death. His mother, Zhao Di (Zhao Yulian), insists upon following the tradition of carrying the coffin back to their remote village by foot so that her husband's spirit will remember its way home. As the narrator, the son recounts the story of his parents' courtship, so famous that it has gained the status of a legend in the village. It is here the bleak black and white turns into vivid colors as the story shifts to the past.  His father, Luo Changyu (Zheng Hao), came to the village as the teacher. Immediately, Zhao Di ([[Zhang Ziyi]]) became infatuated with him and he with her. Thus began a courtship which consisted mostly of the exchange of looks and glances between the two. Unfortunately, the courtship was interrupted when Luo was summoned by the government to return to the city. (Several reviewers have speculated that the flashback portion of the film is set during the [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]] and that Luo's recall was for investigation and questioning.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>) Zhao Di's heart was broken; she insisted on waiting for him in the snow and fell so ill that the villagers thought she would die. However, upon hearing news of her illness, the teacher was able to sneak back to the village and Zhao Di, in tears, welcomed the sight of her beloved. Still, their love would not be consummated for a few years more because the teacher was kept away from the village as punishment for having left his assignment in the city without permission.  Returning to the present day, and black and white, the son realizes how important this ritual of carrying the coffin back to village is to his mother, Zhao Di, and he agrees to make all necessary arrangements to fulfill her wish. He is told by the mayor of the village that it might be difficult to find enough porters to carry the father home, as there are few young able men left in the village. The mayor and the son reach an agreement on the price to be paid to the porters. But when the procession sets out, more than 100 people show up to help carry home the casket of the man who was their teacher through various generations in the village. The mayor returns the money to the son, as no one will accept payment for doing what they consider to be an honor rather than a task.  On the morning of the day the son leaves to return to his job in the city, he fulfills his father's dream and teaches a class in the old schoolhouse that was central to his parents having fallen in love, using the textbook his father had written himself.  
Le Roi danse
 Lully ([[Boris Terral]]) starts to gain the favour of the 14-year-old King Louis in 1653 by giving him specially designed shoes for ''[[Ballet de la Nuit]]''. His subsequent rise draws hostility from the old cadres of the court, particularly the royal composer Cambert ([[Johan Leysen]]). However, following [[Cardinal Mazarin]]'s death, Louis ([[Benoît Magimel]]) installs himself in full power as the king in 1661 and he is now at stake with the religious establishment created and controlled by his mother [[Anne of Austria]] (Colette Emmanuelle) at the [[Palais-Royal]]. On the other hand, Lully's animosity with Cambert comes to a novel dimension after Cambert's mistress Madeleine Lambert (Cécile Bois), the daughter of [[Michel Lambert]], marries Lully in 1662. Lully and another [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] favourite Molière ([[Tchéky Karyo]]) are keen to further disarm the old court but they get to understand their limits when conflict becomes more manifest at events such as staging (and consequent ban) of ''[[Tartuffe]]'' in 1664. Meanwhile, the passing years bring an end to Lully's position as the king's dance teacher and choreographer and he also has to face the emotional tensions growing with his wife's niece Julie ([[Claire Keim]]), which will culminate at the gala of Cambert's ''[[Pomone (opera)|Pomone]]'' in 1671.  
The Right Temptation
 A former police officer, Derian McCall ([[Rebecca De Mornay]]), handed her badge for not agreeing with the procedure and then a colleague with a friend, opened a detective agency. One day Anthea ([[Dana Delany]]) walks in, the wife of a wealthy investor, Michael Ferrow-Smith ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]). Anthea asks Derian to flirt with Michael to see if he is unfaithful, but soon Derian is having an affair with him, not realizing that the Anthea has planned a complicated murder.  
Romeo Must Die
 Po Sing (Jon Kit Lee) is waiting for someone in a nightclub in a predominantly Black neighborhood when a group of angry patrons try to start a fight with him. His father's right-hand man Kai ([[Russell Wong]]) and his henchmen pull Po out and, after a brief fight with the bouncers, are ejected by Silk ([[DMX (rapper)|DMX]]), the club's owner, before the meeting can take place. The next day, Po is found murdered. Word of Po's death reaches his elder brother, Han ([[Jet Li]]), a former police officer who is imprisoned in [[Hong Kong]]. Han promptly escapes from the prison to investigate.  Isaak O’Day ([[Delroy Lindo]]), a Black real estate developer and gang leader, is engaged in a joint business venture with Po's father, Ch’u Sing ([[Henry O]]), a Chinese crime boss who heads a collective of Chinese crime lords. The two  have been acquiring properties along the [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] waterfront to sell them to Vincent Roth, a businessman who plans to buy a new [[National Football League|NFL]] franchise and build a stadium on the waterfront. Despite Ch'u's assurances that the deal is still in place, Isaak fears retribution and has his chief lieutenant Mac ([[Isaiah Washington]]) place security details on both of his children.  Making his way to Oakland, Han learns that his brother called Isaak's daughter Trish’s ([[Aaliyah]]) record store the day before he was killed. After a chance encounter, Han befriends Trish by helping her ditch her assigned security, Maurice ([[Anthony Anderson]]) and Trish deduces that Po was actually calling her brother, Colin ([[DB Woodside]]).  At his brother's funeral, Han confronts his estranged father, blaming him for failing to keep his promise to protect Po after Han had helped them both flee to America to escape the Chinese authorities. Kai informs Han that the waterfront properties are divided between Black and Chinese businesses, and Po was a casualty of racial tensions that have recently escalated into a gang war. Meanwhile, Colin tells his father that Po's aborted meeting was to discuss information Po had that could end the gang war. Isaak explains that the deal with Roth will get their family out of the crime business for good, but warns Colin to be cautious. That night, someone kills Colin and his girlfriend by throwing them out of his high rise apartment.  As Han comforts Trish, he learns that Po wanted to show Colin a list of businesses that were either destroyed or being threatened for failing to sell their properties. The two visit one of the remaining businesses on Po's list but the Chinese owner and his employees have been killed. After killing the Chinese [[hitmen]], Han questions his father, who clumsily deflects suspicion by suggesting Isaak may have used outside contractors. Trish and Han visit the last holdout on Po's list: Silk's nightclub. Mac interrupts their meeting to kill Silk and take his property deed, then abducts Trish and Han. At a remote location, Han escapes by overpowering Mac's henchmen and forces Maurice to divulge where Trish was taken. Meanwhile, Ch’u has his fellow crime lords killed to sell their properties and keep the money to himself.  Isaak and Ch’u meet with Roth at the Oakland Men’s Club to sell Roth the deeds for the properties they now control. After Ch’u takes a multimillion-dollar payment and departs, Isaak refuses his payment, stating that ''his'' compensation will be in the form of an ownership share of the new franchise. An enraged Mac has Trish brought out as a hostage to force him to take the payout. He reveals to Isaak that the "gang war" was a ruse he and Ch'u concocted to cover their murder and intimidation of businessmen who refused to sign away their properties, and he also killed Colin. Isaak attacks him in a rage and Mac shoots him. Roth flees to the rooftop and escapes via helicopter but Mac shoots Roth's briefcase out of his hand, sending the deeds flying to the winds. Isaak shoots the henchman holding Trish, while Han arrives and confronts Mac about his brother. Mac reveals that it was Kai who killed Po, and is about to shoot Han when Trish shoots and kills Mac first. Han and Isaak have a friendly introduction, then Trish waits with her father for an ambulance while Han leaves to confront Kai.  At the Sing compound, Kai and Han have an all-out fight. Kai burns Han's hands with hot coals but Han rips his shirt to improvise hand wraps, then finishes Kai by landing a kick on Kai's skull, completely breaking his spine. He confronts Ch'u over callously having his own son killed for no other reason than getting in the way of his business deal. With Kai dead, there is no one to protect Ch'u from answering for his crimes to either the American authorities or the other crime families. As Han walks away, his father picks up his gun and commits suicide.  Han finds Trish waiting for him outside and the two walk away from the house together.  
Rules of Engagement (film)
 In 1968, a disastrous American advance in the [[Vietnam War]] has Lieutenant Terry Childers ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) executing an unarmed prisoner in order to intimidate a captive [[Vietnam People's Army|North Vietnamese army]] officer into calling off an ambush of [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]]. His act thereby saves the life of the wounded Lieutenant Hayes Hodges ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]), though many of Hodges' men die in the battle.  In 1996, now a colonel, Hodges is about to retire from the Marine Corps and is reminiscing about his years in uniform. As a result of wounds he sustained during Operation Kingfisher, he was no longer able to continue serving as an infantry officer, so the Marine Corps sent him to law school and he continued his career as a [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|JAG]] officer.  He subsequently enters the [[Camp Lejeune]] Officers Club, where numerous Marine officers wait to honor his service at a pre-retirement party.  Hosting the event is his old friend, Colonel Terry Childers, who is now the commanding officer of a [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]] (MEU).  Subsequently deployed to Southwest Asia as part of an [[Amphibious Readiness Group]], Childers and his embarked MEU are called to evacuate the [[U.S. Ambassador to Yemen]] from the embassy grounds as a routine demonstration against American influence on the [[Arabian peninsula]] and in the [[Persian Gulf]] turns into rock-throwing and sporadic automatic-rifle fire by snipers from nearby rooftops. After escorting Ambassador Mourain ([[Ben Kingsley]]) and his family to a waiting helicopter, Childers returns to the embassy to retrieve the American flag; meanwhile three Marines are killed by snipers on nearby rooftops. Childers then orders his men to open fire on the crowd and "waste the motherfuckers", resulting in the deaths of 83 irregular Yemeni soldiers, most of whom were armed, and injuries to over 100 more, saving the lives of the remaining US Marines and Embassy staff.  Back in the U.S., the [[U.S. National Security Advisor]], Bill Sokal ([[Bruce Greenwood]]), pressures the military to proceed with a [[court-martial]] to try to deflect negative public opinion about the United States and salvage American relations in the [[Middle East]], placing all the blame for the incident onto Childers.  Childers subsequently approaches Hodges and asks him to be his defense attorney at the upcoming court-martial. Hodges is reluctant to accept, knowing that his record as a JAG officer is less than impressive and Childers needs a better lawyer. But Childers is adamant because he wants an attorney who has served in combat.  With little time to prepare a defense, Hodges visits Yemen, only to find an uncooperative government and firsthand account of the serious injuries the crowd members endured. Most of the evidence is stacked against Childers, particularly the fact that no one else in his team can testify to having seen gunfire coming from the crowd, in particular Captain Lee ([[Blair Underwood]]), who hesitated to follow Childers' order.  Sokal is determined for him to be convicted and is met by the overzealous prosecutor, Major Biggs ([[Guy Pearce]]), who believes Childers to be absolutely guilty. Sokal at one point burns a videotape of [[closed-circuit television|security camera]] footage revealing that the crowd were indeed armed and firing at the Marines, evidence that would potentially exonerate Childers. He also blackmails Ambassador Mourain into lying on the stand and saying both that the crowd had been peaceful and that Childers had been violent towards him and his family during the evacuation.  Colonel Hodges meets with Mourain's wife after the ambassador's testimony to hear her side of the story. Although she admits Childers had been valiant, she refuses to testify and destroy her marriage.  During the trial, Hodges presents a shipping manifest proving that a tape from an undamaged camera which had been looking directly into the crowd—the tape Sokal had burned—had been delivered to Sokal's office, but failed to show up at the trial, arguing that this tape would not have been damning evidence against Childers if it had, in fact, shown the crowd was armed.  Captain Lee is grilled on the witness stand by Major Biggs and despite trying to give favorable testimony, leaves doubt of Childers' innocence.   Childers himself eventually takes the stand and engages in a fierce verbal battle with Biggs. Biggs produces a tape which contains the recording of Childers' poor choice of words when giving his order. While defending his actions, Childers loses his temper while stating that he would not sacrifice the lives of his men to appease the likes of Biggs. Hodges is left at a loss for words, knowing that this could easily doom Childers because they do not have any credible evidence to defend Childers's claims that the crowd was armed and his poor choice of words can be interpreted by the jury as being prejudiced towards Yemenis or having a gung-ho/cowboy attitude.  Already at an advantage, the prosecution presents the Vietnamese colonel who witnessed Childers execute a POW in Vietnam, Colonel Cao, as a rebuttal witness, trying to drive home the idea that Childers is malicious. Hodges cross-examines him and gets him to testify that had the circumstances been reversed, Cao would have done the same thing. After the trial, Hodges visits Sokal and asks him what happened to the tape; Sokal denies its existence.  Childers is found guilty of the minor charge of breach of the peace (for having disobeyed his order to just show his Marines), but not guilty of the more serious charges of conduct unbecoming an officer and murder. A final title card reveals that no further charges were brought against Childers and that he retired honorably from the Marine Corps. The title card also explains that both Sokal and Mourain lost their jobs after being convicted of [[spoliation of evidence|destruction of evidence]] and [[perjury]], respectively.  
Rugrats in Paris: The Movie
 The film opens with a parody of [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s 1972 film ''[[The Godfather]]'' at the wedding reception of Lou Pickles and his new wife, Lulu (his first wife Trixie, the mother of Stu and Drew, died before the series began). A mother-child dance during the reception saddens [[Chuckie Finster]], who realizes that he has lived over two years of his life without his mother, who died of an illness shortly after he was born. His father, Chas, shares Chuckie's loneliness.  [[Tommy Pickles]]' father, [[Stu Pickles| Stu]], is summoned to EuroReptarland, a Japanese amusement park in [[Paris, France]], to fix a malfunctioning [[Reptar]] robot. Due to a misunderstanding (as the company only needed Stu but summoned him at midnight due to the time change while he was sleeping), Tommy, Chuckie, [[Phil and Lil DeVille|Phil, Lil]], [[Angelica Pickles|Angelica]], [[Dil Pickles|Dil]], their dog [[Spike (Rugrats)|Spike]], and all their parents travel to Paris to take a vacation at the park.  Coco LaBouche, the cold-hearted, child-hating head of EuroReptarland, yearns to be the president of the entire Reptar franchise and its parent company, Yamaguchi Industries, after her employer, Mr. Yamaguchi, reveals his plans to retire as president. Yamaguchi says that his successor has to love children to be able to do the job, so LaBouche lies to him by claiming to be engaged to a man with a child. Upon the Rugrats' arrival at EuroReptarland, Angelica overhears a conversation between Coco and Yamaguchi before being caught. To save herself, Angelica reveals that Chas is looking for a wife and suggests that Coco [[marriage of convenience|marry]] him.  Coco strikes up a relationship with Chas, but her attempts to bond with Chuckie fail.

Running Mates (2000 film)
 [[Michigan]] Governor James Reynolds Pryce ([[Tom Selleck]]) is a popular liberal politician who, while running for the office of the [[President of the United States]], finds out to what a great degree his life and career are influenced by the women in his life. As a front-runner for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] presidential candidate, Pryce owes the success of his campaign to his manager Lauren Hartman (Laura Linney) and his wife Jennifer (Nancy Travis). Pryce has not yet chosen a vice-presidential running mate and has a hard time making the decision. Senator Parker Gable ([[Robert Culp]]) was something of a mentor to Pryce in his early political career, but Gable is a [[Promiscuity|womanizer]] which makes Pryce uncomfortable with making him the vice-presidential candidate. Nevertheless, Gable's Washington [[socialite]] wife Meg (Faye Dunaway) considers Gable to be the best choice and tries to exert pressure over Pryce to make this happen. Pryce's other choices are Senator Mitchell Morris ([[Bruce McGill]]), a [[Lobbying|lobbyist]] whom Pryce dislikes due to his close ties to [[Big Business]], and Senator Terrence Randall ([[Bob Gunton]]), who is disliked by Pryce's shallow Hollywood campaign fundraising manager Shawna Morgan (Teri Hatcher). Being previously sexually involved with Lauren, Meg, and Shawna before marrying Jennifer makes listening to their advice all that much harder for Pryce. All four women are seemingly more intent on exerting control over Pryce and winning their own personal battles against each other rather than honestly trying to help him make the correct political decision.

Despite wanting to help Grace, none of the residents are able to find a way to get her out of her dire situation.  Eventually, Grace's financial situation reaches the point where she is unable to pay Matthew, but the gardener steadfastly insists that he will continue taking care of her property. In exchange he asks Grace to take a look at some plants he is having difficulty cultivating, as Grace's remarkable talent with [[horticulture]] is well known throughout town. Arriving that evening to examine the plants, Grace is surprised to discover a sickly-looking grove of [[marijuana]]. Despite her initial disgust at Matthew's actions, Grace nevertheless takes one of the plants back to her home, unable to leave a "sick plant" unattended. Within 24 hours she is able to not only restore the plant to health, but has it [[Cannabis cultivation#Flowering phase|producing small buds]], much to Matthew's amazement.  Grace's life is further disrupted when a [[appraiser|property appraiser]] arrives at her home, informing her that it is forcibly being put up for auction. She later learns that her husband's debts were worse than she thought, totaling more than £300,000, most owed to Rampton's, a London investment firm. The next day Grace asks Matthew the approximate value of the marijuana plant she rescued; when he informs her that, "ounce-for-ounce the really good stuff's worth more than gold," she proposes a partnership.  Matthew will help her grow and sell marijuana, and after accumulating enough cash to pay off her debts the rest will be split evenly. Matthew accepts, and that evening returns to Nicky, eager to share the good news.  Nicky is less than pleased, convinced the plan is reckless and fearing that Matthew will be caught and arrested. Now unsure of her relationship with him, Nicky holds off on telling Matthew that she has just discovered she is pregnant.  Grace and Matthew quickly start up a large and successful [[hydroponics|hydroponic]] grow operation in Grace's greenhouse. Sometime after Grace meets Honey Chambers ([[Diana Quick]]) placing flowers at her husband's grave, the act confirming her long-held suspicion that her husband was having an affair, based on letters he tried to have her send to an address in London. The next day she asks Matthew to guide her in [[Cannabis smoking|smoking pot]] for the first time, and thoroughly enjoys the experience. While the two are high, Matthew asks her what made her decide to grow marijuana; Grace cryptically replies with Honey's London address.  As the time to harvest the marijuana approaches Grace has a chance encounter with Nicky, whose evasion of her makes her curious. The two finally talk, and Nicky asks Grace to ensure that her boyfriend won't get arrested. Moved by Nicky's plea, Grace tells Matthew that he won't be going to London to find a buyer, and subsequently sneaks off there herself. Grace's efforts to locate a dealer prove unsuccessful, and she ultimately has to be rescued from a police station by Honey after venturing into a seedy pub. At Honey's home, Grace manages to convince the other woman to call her dealer, Vince ([[Bill Bailey]]), to try and sell the marijuana. Vince is impressed by the quality, but lacks the money necessary to buy the full 20 kilograms Grace is offering. After some pleading, Vince agrees to take the two women to someone who has enough money.  Back in Port Isaac, Matthew discovers that Grace has gone to London from Dr Bamford, and follows her to Honey's house accompanied by Bamford, remembering the London address Grace told him earlier. The two arrive in time to see Vince, Honey, and Grace leave, and follow.  Vince takes Grace and Honey to a yet-to-be-opened aquatic-themed rave club where they meet with French businessman Jacques Chevalier ([[Tchéky Karyo]]). Grace impresses Chevalier by instructing him on improving his casting with a [[fishing rod]] in French, and is progressing towards a deal when Matthew and Dr Bamford arrive, nearly causing an incident when Chevalier's bodyguard China MacFarlane ([[Jamie Foreman]]) mistakes their appearance for an ambush. The situation is quickly calmed, and in a private office Chevalier and Grace negotiate a deal for the marijuana, Grace almost crying with relief when the businessman accepts. Grace, Vince, and Dr Bamford head back to Port Isaac; Chevalier secretly instructs China to take Vince and follow them to Grace's home.  Arriving back in Port Isaac to harvest the marijuana, Grace discovers that the [[Women's Institutes|Women's Institute]] is preparing to have a luncheon at her house, and that Rampton's adjuster Quentin Rhodes ([[Clive Merrison]]) is heading to the house as well to discuss the foreclosure. Grace and Matthew's friend Harvey (Tristan Sturrock) stay to harvest the marijuana while Matthew returns to town to reconcile with Nicky. At the dock, Matthew apologizes and proclaims his love to Nicky, who responds by telling Matthew that she is pregnant. The two joyously celebrate momentarily, before being informed by local barkeep Charlie ([[Paul Brooke]]) that two men have been asking about Grace; Matthew quickly identifies them as Vince and China, and returns to warn Grace while Nicky tells local Police Sergeant Alfred Mabely ([[Ken Campbell]]) that the two are actually salmon poachers, prompting him to keep an eye on the two.  At Grace's house, Grace, Matthew, Dr Bamford and Nicky all frantically attempt to dismantle the grow operation while Harvey keeps Quentin distracted in the house.  Vince and China arrive at the home; when Harvey leaves to warn Grace, Vince and China slip in and confront Quentin, believing he is another buyer of the marijuana. Sergeant Mabely arrives and discovers Grace's grow operation, but rather than arresting her explains that he was well aware of her activities and decided to turn a blind eye. However, he warns her that he's called in other police officers to follow his supposed salmon poachers and leaves. Fearing their imminent discovery, Grace decides to burn the dried marijuana rather than facing possible jail time, but as she holds a lit match over the pile China arrives, holding Quentin at knifepoint and demanding Grace put the match out. Before she can it burns her fingers, and she drops it into the pile.  At the same moment, a woman from the local WI arrives, surprises China, but then flees at the sight of China wielding a switchblade. China chases her, only to run into the rest of the arriving women, who beat him into submission with their handbags. The police arrive shortly thereafter, attempting to break up the riotous mob. Grace and her friends flee in the confusion while the huge marijuana pile burns inside the greenhouse.  Inside her house, Grace is surprised to find Chevalier. She confronts him over his betrayal, but he responds that he sent China to follow her not to steal from her, but to protect her.  He goes on to express a budding romantic interest in her, which after some hesitation Grace accepts.

Gail hooks up with Buffy's [[intellectually disabled]] brother Special Officer Doofy ([[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]]), hoping to milk the facts out of him.  While Cindy is in class, she receives a note reading: "I Know What You Did Last Halloween!" She then realizes that Drew was murdered exactly one year after she and her friends accidentally killed a man during a wild car ride. At a beauty pageant that evening, Greg is killed by Ghostface in plain view, with the audience mistaking Buffy's screams and pleas for help as being part of her act. When Buffy realizes she's won the pageant, she almost immediately forgets about Greg's death and celebrates her victory.  After Cindy goes home alone, she is attacked by Ghostface. Cindy locks herself in her room and contacts the police, while Ghostface disappears. Bobby arrives momentarily after hearing the incident, but a knife, a pair of black gloves and a telephone fall out of his pocket, leading Cindy to believe that he was the killer. Bobby is arrested and taken to the police station. Afterwards, Cindy heads to Buffy and Doofy's place, to spend the night with them. When there, she receives a call from Ghostface, mocking her.

However, the plan backfires when Ray stabs Bobby repeatedly, angry because his favorite show, ''[[The Wayans Bros.]]'', has been cancelled. Ghostface abruptly arrives and stabs Ray.

At the police station, Cindy and the sheriff ([[Kurt Fuller]]) realize that Doofy, the only person who knew about the car accident, was actually faking his disability and is the true killer. Unfortunately, Doofy has already escaped with Gail Hailstorm. Upon finding his discarded disguise in the street, Cindy begins screaming, but is soon hit by a car.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Shorty appears and breaks the [[fourth wall]] by giving tips on how to survive this sort of "situation".

[[List of Scream characters#Martha Meeks|Martha Meeks]], the sister of Sidney's friend [[List of Scream characters#Randy Meeks|Randy]], who was murdered in the previous film, visits Sidney and the others to drop off a videotape that Randy had made before his death, posthumously warning them that the rules of a horror film franchise in the third and final film do not apply to anyone, and that any of them, including the main character (Sidney), could die.

He reveals himself as Roman, having faked his death and survived being shot due to a [[bulletproof vest]]. Roman admits to being Sidney's half-brother, born to their mother [[List of Scream characters#Maureen Prescott|Maureen Prescott]] when she was an actress in Hollywood. Years ago, he had unsuccessfully tried reuniting with her. Bitter over the rejection, Roman would film all the men she philandered with. He showed [[List of Scream characters#Billy Loomis|Billy Loomis]] the footage of his father with Maureen, which motivated him to kill her (thus setting off the events in ''Scream'' and ''Scream 2''). However, when he discovered how much fame Sidney had attracted due to those events, Roman snapped and lured Sidney out of hiding.  Roman then tells Sidney of his plan to frame her for the murders, before killing ''Stab'' producer John Milton. Sidney angrily tells Roman that he is responsible for all of the events that have occurred. A fight ensues between Sidney and Roman, ending when Roman shoots Sidney in the chest, seemingly killing her. While preparing for Gale and Dewey to arrive, Sidney disappears, giving her the upper hand to stab Roman in the back. As he slowly dies, Sidney shows him that she too was wearing a bulletproof vest. She then plunges Roman's knife into his chest, apparently killing him. Dewey and Gale arrive before Roman recovers, only for Dewey to shoot him in the head while being encouraged by Sidney, finally killing him and ending his killing spree.  Sometime after at Sidney's house, Dewey proposes to Gale, who accepts. Sidney returns from a walk with her dog and leaves her gates, which were previously shown to be alarmed, open.

As she goes to join the others, her front door blows open behind her, but after hesitating for a moment she walks away leaving it as is, finally confident that the murders have ended and she is now safe.  
Screwed (2000 film)
 Willard ([[Norm Macdonald]]) is an overworked, underpaid chauffeur who works for a mean-spirited pie heiress named Mrs. Crock ([[Elaine Stritch]]), just as his father did before him. All Willard wants for [[Christmas]] is a new uniform, as the one he currently wears is the one his father was buried in, but Crock gives him a cheap pair of [[cuff links]] and a pie instead, while lavishing expensive gifts on her business partner Chip Oswald ([[Sherman Hemsley]]) and her prized dog Muffin. Finally fed up with being mistreated, Willard and his best friend, local chicken restaurant owner Rusty ([[Dave Chappelle]]), concoct a scheme to kidnap the dog and hold it for a $1,000,000 ransom. Muffin attacks him, leaving a great deal of destruction and Willard's blood at the scene, and the plan fails when the dog later escapes.  However, Crock and the [[Pittsburgh Bureau of Police|Pittsburgh police]] misinterpret the hastily scrawled ransom note and believe that Willard himself has been kidnapped. Crock refuses to pay up initially until met with public protests led by Willard's on-again off-again girlfriend Hillary ([[Sarah Silverman]]). Willard and Rusty come up with a new scheme, in which Willard films a fake ransom video and releases it to the media, putting pressure on Crock to come up with the money to preserve her public image as a kindly old grandmother. The plan calls for Willard to mug his boss as she goes to drop off the ransom money, and to have a dead body left behind dressed as Willard to throw off the police. They enlist the services of a creepy morgue employee named Grover Cleaver ([[Danny DeVito]]) to find an appropriate corpse and schedule a meeting at night in the park.  This plan also goes wrong, however, when Willard succeeds in getting the money, only to lose it to two small children who attack him with a taser and a shiv and steal the suitcase. Willard is found by the police and sent to a hospital, as the children have soundly brutalized him. The police then find the dead body that was supposed to take the place of Willard as he made his getaway, and Willard claims that it was his captor. The police are suspicious, as Grover used the body of an old homeless dwarf, but Willard claims he was "more ferocious when he was alive". Willard dejectedly returns to work for Mrs. Crock (who claims that he now owes her the ransom as well) until the mother of one of his attackers shows up and returns the briefcase. Overjoyed, Willard and Rusty plan to go on a long vacation only to find that the briefcase was filled with newspaper and cabbage.  After interrogating Willard and Rusty (during which Rusty reveals his habit of striking people with desk lamps when nervous), the police go after Grover, who goes on a rampage, kidnapping Mrs. Crock while waiting for the share of money Willard promised him. Willard goes to Grover and confronts his employer, finding out that the money was actually in the briefcase but was stolen by Chip Oswald, who planned to double-cross them all and make off with his boyfriend. He also discovers to everyone's disgust that his father was also Mrs. Crock's lover as well as manservant. After the police converge on Grover's place, Crock convinces them that the trio are actually her rescuers.  In the end, Willard leads the police to Chip's apartment, where the ransom money is discovered. When Chip pulls a gun, Rusty panics and knocks him unconscious by hitting him in the head with a [[lava lamp]]. Mrs. Crock expresses her gratitude by paying for Willard to attend college at the [[University of Southern California]] and buying him a new [[Armani]] suit, and paying for Rusty to open a new Chicken Hole on the beach. Willard finally reconciles with Hillary, while Crock herself ends up in a romantic relationship with Grover.  
Scrapbook (film)
  Scrapbook begins with opening credits rolling while a kidnapped woman has a frantic discussion in the dark with an incoherent female voice.  As the credits conclude, the door to the van opens and the woman discovers, to her horror, that the incoherent voice belonged to a disemboweled woman.  A man reaches in and removes the disemboweled woman.  We then see a flashback about a child named Leonard.  He looks in on his sister, who is half-naked and apparently aroused.  She notices him, and takes him into her room, where she proceeds to molest him.  A young man enters the room, and is disgusted with Leonard.  He angrily pulls him downstairs, where he proceeds to rape the boy.  The film then cuts to the present, where Leonard has grown up into a young man and kidnapper of the females from the introduction.  Clara is his latest victim.  Leonard has her tied to a chair in a large, unkempt trailer home in the middle of nowhere.  The walls and furniture are adorned with photos and body parts of his past victims.  He reveals his scrapbook to Clara, in which he forced his past victims to document their horrific experiences at his hands.  He then tells her that he plans for her to be his "last chapter", before he tries to have the book published, which he believes will lead to fame and fortune.  Leonard then drags Clara into a room with the words "I'm winning" scrawled on the wall, presumably in blood.  He then violently beats and rapes her, and then urinates on her.  Clara is beaten, raped, and abused in various ways throughout the movie, as she tries to find a way to escape.  Finally Clara comes to realize that in order to survive she must manipulate him through what he writes in the Scrapbook.  Slowly Leonard starts to give her food and clothes.  Clara pretends that she wants to make love to Leonard and uses duct tape to tie his arms and legs to the cot.  Thereafter, she stabs Leonard on the bottom of his feet with a knife and takes pictures of him in pain.  She puts those pictures in the Scrapbook and the film ends with her walking away from the house.  
Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders
 The Mystery Machine is driving through a desert in [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. A sandstorm comes up and [[Shaggy Rogers]] makes a wrong turn onto government property. Seeing a [[unidentified flying object|UFO]] causes Shaggy to lose control of the vehicle and the gang find themselves on the outskirts of a small town. While [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] and Shaggy stay with the van, the rest of the gang enters a local diner to get directions. Shaggy and Scooby then see a mythical animal called a [[jackalope]]. The jackalope takes their last Scooby Snack and they chase it into a cave, where they encounter aliens. They run into the diner in panic, claiming to have seen [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]].  The waitress, Dottie, says that they never see aliens but do see strange lights and hear sounds at night. The chef, Sergio, says that a month earlier local [[cattle]] vanished without a trace and a lot of people moved away. A man named Lester claims to have been abducted and he believes the two. He also claims to have pictures, so the gang goes to his house to see them. However, they are nothing more than paintings by Lester. He then refers to SALF: the Search for Alien Life Forms (similar to [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|S.E.T.I.]]), dishes, saying that ever since they were installed, there have been numerous UFO sightings and disappearing livestock.  The gang stays overnight at Lester's home where [[Daphne Blake]] and [[Velma Dinkley]] sleep in a bunk bed and [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]] sleeps on the couch. Scooby and Shaggy fall into a deep sleep on the roof and are abducted. The aliens try to examine the two, but Scooby is able to free them. After being cornered by the aliens when they try to escape, they pass out. They are awakened in the middle of the desert by a [[hippie]] photographer named Crystal, and her [[golden retriever]], Amber. Shaggy and Scooby immediately fall in love with them, and when they meet up with Fred and the girls at the local diner, the two of them are still so [[Lovesickness|love struck]] after seeing Crystal and Amber that they are not even hungry, which shocks Fred, Daphne, and Velma.  Fred, Daphne, and Velma meet the crew of SALF, Steve, Laura, and Max, while Shaggy and Scooby hang out with Crystal and Amber. Velma becomes suspicious when she sees dried mud on the boots of Steve, Laura, and Max since they are in the desert. She later takes the gang to a canyon where she believes a seasonal river runs. The canyon proves to be dry, but they find caves, mining equipment and on the cave walls, [[gold]]. The SALF crew capture and tie them up. The crew explains that they stumbled on the gold cave while searching for a new location for another SALF dish. Since the gold cave was on government land, they decided to keep the secret for themselves, and they planned to keep it that way. They are also exposed as the "aliens" who abducted Scooby and Shaggy, with the UFO being nothing more than a dressed-up [[helicopter]], and the inside of the UFO being an old movie set. Shaggy, Scooby, Crystal and Amber also investigate the cave in the canyon and find the gang and try to rescue them.  Eventually, Crystal and Amber reveal themselves to be the actual aliens from a planet 20 light years away. They disguised themselves as hippies because their only information about Earth came from 1960s television broadcasts. The UFO that ran the Mystery Gang off the road was actually Crystal and Amber's spaceship. The gang, Crystal, and Amber manage to stop the SALF crew from escaping and tie them up. The SALF crew and their accomplices are arrested, and Crystal and Amber return to their homeworld after a heartfelt goodbye. Shaggy and Scooby are brokenhearted, but a box of Scooby Snacks helps them forget about their sorrows.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Scooby-Doo scares the viewer in an alien costume.

The Scarecrow (2000 film)
 The film opens with an elderly woman, who reveals herself to be a kindly witch, telling the audience about the town of Grisham Heights, owned by the selfish and dance obsessed Count Grisham. She explains that she was Grisham's dance teacher, until he chased her into hiding when he accidentally discovered that she was a witch, and was forced to live in an abandoned house far outside of the village, with only her magic broom Bristles for company. She then goes on to explain the town's workhouse mill, which is where all orphans and debtors are sent to work off their debts, and that it takes thirteen pieces of silver to buy your freedom. The witch then introduces the audience to Polly, a girl who has been in the mill nearly her whole life, but has been saving her silver coins and hiding them at the foot of her scarecrow (without realizing that the witch lives at the house). Because she is lonely, the witch decides to bring her scarecrow to life after Polly leaves, using a magic feather to do so, which also allows a pessimistic mouse, Max, who lives in the Scarecrow's pocket, to talk.  As the years pass, Scarecrow begins to fall in love with Polly after her constant visits. It's shown by the witch that Polly earned her required amount a long time ago, but decided to stay when three young orphans arrived, and wished to help them so they could leave together. Seeing that Scarecrow is in love with Polly, and worried she'll be discovered and chased away again, the witch leaves the village, telling Scarecrow that she will miss him and teaches him how to dance. Scarecrow is saddened, but determined to find a way to be with Polly and watch over her money until she is able to free herself and the children.  Meanwhile, Count Grisham wants Polly to be his, and constantly attempts to woo her with promises of giving her and the children a good life and home, though Polly is able to see right through his selfish act and continuously turns him down. On the day she earns the last silver coin they need, Grisham finds out and sends the workhouse mill overseer, Cheswick, to find Polly's silver. Cheswick follows Polly to the old garden, and digs up her money after she leaves, but Scarecrow reveals himself in an attempt to retrieve it and frightens Cheswick, who runs to Grisham's two thugs for help. They corner Scarecrow in the old house, where he discovers a magic feather and a message left to him by the witch, which tells him that the feather (when worn) will turn him human, but that "real life" will never be his until he is willing to give that life for another.  Scarecrow dons the feather and easily fools Grisham's thugs into believing he is merely a traveler named Feathertop, and they leave, though Cheswick is not convinced. Meanwhile, Polly returns to the garden to find her money gone, and weeps in despair. The next morning, Grisham comes up with a plan to ensnare Polly with his "love spell dance" to make her his by holding a dance contest, with 52 pieces of silver (the exact amount she needs) as the prize. Feathertop shows off his dancing skills to a crowd in the town square, which prompts Polly to ask him to teach her and be her partner at the dance. During her lesson, the two share a romantic dance and begin to fall in love, until Grisham interrupts to ask Polly to be his partner. He is angry to learn that she already has a partner, and on the night of the contest sends his thugs to trap Feathertop so he cannot attend. Feathertop escapes the thugs and he and Polly win the contest. Feathertop gives all the money to Polly, and the two confess their love for each other, and plan to marry the next morning.  Grisham confronts Feathertop, discovering his true identity. He ties Scarecrow up in the same field and steals his feather, which transforms him into Feathertop upon wearing it, hoping to trick Polly into marrying him, but she is able to see right through him. Grisham tries to force her to marry him, but she, and the priest, refuse to go along with it. Scarecrow manages to escape, and retrieves his feather thanks to Max, but decides to leave Polly because he knows he can never truly be with her. Polly is still waiting for him at the church when Grisham angrily tells his manservant Woody that he intends to kill Polly for rejecting him, but Woody abandons him to warn Polly. Bristles, who was eavesdropping, flies off to warn Feathertop.  Polly and the children attempt to escape town in Grisham's carriage, but the only way out is across a bridge over a gorge that Grisham ordered his thugs to weaken. Feathertop arrives and climbs under to hold the supports together until Polly and the children are safely across. Grisham tries to intervene, and in the struggle falls to his death. Feathertop manages to hold the bridge together long enough for the carriage to cross, then falls into the gorge as it collapses. Max and Bristles search the rubble and find him apparently dead, but are overjoyed to see him alive, and they climb out of the gorge together. Polly is waiting at the top, and joyfully embraces Feathertop, who tries to explain why they can't be together, only to realize that his feather fell out of his hat when he climbed out of the gorge, meaning he is now human permanently. He and Polly kiss, and the town celebrates Grisham's demise by cleaning up and holding a large dance in the town square and renaming the town Swingtown, while the witch brings a girl broom to life for Bristles, and closes the film by addressing the audience the same way she did at the beginning.

Dawn feels that she is unable to articulate the troubles she experience at school to her parents. In fact, she is quite successful in hiding both the truth as well as her pain from her family. When Dawn tries to connect with them individually, Russell seems unable to handle any type of intimacy with his daughter and puts up an air of passivity. Joyce, on the other hand, is incapable of discussing anything without relating it back to herself, thus constantly taking the focus away from Dawn, where it should be. Tragically, Dawn attempts to find salvation from these two shaky worlds in the arms of a 19-year-old musician who, in reality, has little interest in finding out about her as a person, and only cares about how she can satisfy him physically.   Back at school, another series of humiliating experiences leaves Dawn running to find solitude so she can again numb her emotional pain by cutting. This time, her activities are discovered by Lorraine, another social outsider in the high school with whom she can relate. A well-meaning teacher, who observes blood on Dawn's blouse, calls Dawn's parents to the school to address the matter.   Humiliated that their façade as a perfect all-American family has been shattered, Dawn's mother again brings the focus of the situation back to her by insisting that she does not want to be blamed for Dawn's actions. Joyce fails to recognize that her daughter requires someone to understand her by listening to what she has to say. Meanwhile, Dawn's father remains distant and emotionless as usual. Russell thinks only of himself and is afraid that he will be blamed for Dawn's self-harm. Ironically, the new strains that her condition has put on her family leave Dawn further unable to cope, and she winds up in the emergency room after seriously burning herself with a cigarette lighter in a desperate attempt to alleviate the stress.  Lorraine introduces Dawn to her psychiatrist, Dr. Parella ([[Rhea Perlman]]) who seems to be the only understanding voice in the torment of Dawn's volatile and painful world. Realizing there is no alternative for Dawn, her parents agree to allow her to begin counselling with Dr. Parella. Through counselling, Dawn slowly begins to understand that the nature of her disorder stems not simply from her constant feelings of abandonment by the people she loves, but also from her inability to express this pain through verbal channels. Instead, Dawn uses cutting to communicate what she feels inside. Her inability to communicate individually with her parents (as well as their inability to communicate with one another) leaves any hope of emotional support for Dawn unattainable.  Triggered by the news that her friend Lorraine has been brutally beaten by her mother's boyfriend (and by her own mother's refusal to take her to the hospital to visit Lorraine), Dawn loses control and again winds up in the emergency room after having brutally slashed her body. Joyce, feeling she can no longer bear the blame for her daughter's condition, decides it would be better for her to simply leave her family, and she does. Her departure finally triggers a change in Dawn. When Dr. Parella comes to visit her in the hospital afterwards, Dawn breaks down into tears - something she had been unable to do before then. Dr. Parella points out that if tears can take the place of blood, then Dawn has at last begun the long road to recovery.  After being released, Dawn goes to visit Lorraine, who is still in the hospital recovering. Lorraine informs Dawn that her mother is considering leaving her boyfriend, and Dawn tells Lorraine about her mother leaving and what Dr. Parella had said. Lorraine then tells Dawn that the popular kids at their school needed to enjoy being popular while they could, but her and Dawn's time is just beginning.  
A Sense of Entitlement
 The film tells the story of two sisters, Caroline and Jessica, after their father calls Jessica and informs her that he will no longer finance their expensive New York lifestyle.  Each sister reacts in different ways: Jessica must figure out how to continue her art studies and whether to move to France with her boyfriend Albert, while Caroline prostitutes herself to two investment bankers.  When the girls' father, Mr. Blaine, arrives in town accompanied by his bodyguard/assistant Benton, Albert, who had come to Jessica's apartment to surprise her, is accidentally shot when he is mistaken for somebody who has been sending death threats to Mr. Blaine.  
The Seal of Nehahra
  The film begins in late 2109. At the Slipgate Complex in [[Dallas, Texas]], the military are overseeing development of a [[teleporter]] called a Slipgate. The top-ranking officer at the installation is General Blake. Another General, McQuiggan, has sent detachments of Grunts and Enforcers to the Complex for security purposes; these being genetically engineered soldiers with lowered intelligence and a killing instinct, brought on by electronic brain implants. Blake threatens to resign unless the Grunts leave, as he believes it is dangerous to toy with nature. The Enforcer commander shares his apprehensions. Another new arrival is Major "Bent" Benton, a swaggering officer whom the soldiers immediately dislike.  Eventually, the scientists perfect the Slipgate and begin using it to transport equipment between bases. The film then jumps ahead to 2110, when Major Bent unwisely orders the activation of an overheated Slipgate. The heat causes a malfunction which sends the demolition equipment into another dimension, to an area which was occupied by an Ogre. The Slipgate automatically brings the Ogre back to the Complex, where it is met by a party of soldiers led by the [[misanthropic]] Sergeant Lawrence Maxwell, who has a supernatural ability to translate any language. It communicates its peaceful intent to Maxwell, but a God-fearing soldier mortally wounds it as it flees back to its home dimension through the Slipgate. His dying words identify the humans, as "naked Knights"—Knights being a militaristic, humanoid species that enforces control over the Ogres.  They report the murder to the Knights, who express dismay at Maxwell's translating abilities; this skill is exclusive to the Immortal race, which was thought to have died out. The Knights in turn report to the cultists of the god [[Shub-Niggurath]], who order an invasion of the human dimension. Meanwhile, a military hearing was held to assess the aliens' intentions during the transporter incident, in which Maxwell defends the Ogre's innocence, but is discredited as a witness when Major Bent, using classified intel leaked to him by his father, Senator Bentley, reveals that Lieutenant Maxwell went against orders by retreating and persuading others to do the same during a doomed battle five years prior. The knights teleport to a base in [[Tucson]] and slaughter all of its occupants. While doing so, they discover that both Grunts and Enforcers can be bent to their will through their military implants. Using Jack Torres, a Mexican psychic with [[remote viewing]] abilities, Blake identifies Shub-Niggurath as the leader of the Knights. McQuiggan sends soldiers into the other dimension, including Maxwell and an annoying joker called Phil, against Blake's protests.  The residents of the dimension massacre the soldiers, except for Phil, who escapes, and Maxwell who is captured. The priests explain Maxwell's situation: he is dead by the mortal definition of the term, and will regain his Immortal powers and memories. He is treated well because Shub-Niggurath fears he may revive his creator, her enemy, the god Nehahra. The memories enhance his misanthropic outlook, such that he now wants to annihilate humankind. He also allies with an underground [[resistance movement]], led by an Ogre named Zin and a Gaunt named Priam who controls the realm's various portals, that aims to overthrow Shub-Niggurath. Doing so, however, requires a human.  Meanwhile, many of the soldiers are reassigned in light of the war against these creatures, except Major Bent, whose father denied his transfer request. Shortly thereafter, Grunts and Enforcers attack the Dallas Slipgate Complex. Blake and Torres escape into a safe room, where they figure out how Shub-Niggurath has been controlling the Grunts and Enforcers, but the Enforcer commander commits [[suicide]] to avoid being turned into a servant of Shub-Niggurath. After murdering Director Keith, the creator of the slipgates, Maxwell kills Major Bent as revenge for his previous abusive treatment. Phil has decided to avenge his comrades and invade the other dimension on his own: he goes through the Slipgate and begins slaughtering enemies by the hundreds. Maxwell overhears him on his helmet radio, and guides Phil through the levels of ''Quake'' until he reaches Shub-Niggurath's pit, which can only be unlocked by ancient runes found at the end of each of the four chapters of ''Quake''. After helping Phil slay Chthon, the boss of the first chapter of Quake, Max travels to the deadly Realm of Shades, populated by Wraiths: the ghosts of Immortals who sift through the memories of the dead for clues of their creator, Nehahra. Max promises to help break Nehahra's curse on them by providing them with the soul of Shub-Niggurath, which would show them the location of Nehahra, in exchange for immortality.  Blake orders his amphibious war machines to attack the Knights and Ogres in order to help Phil. Having overheard that teleportation is the most deadly force in the universe, Maxwell sets up a Slipgate for Phil to go through and emerge at Shub-Niggurath's location. This defeats the god, and Phil survives. However, Maxwell has ambitions: he kills his resistance allies so he can take over the dimension with the help of the Wraiths. The film ends as the Immortal conspirators open a gigantic vault door to unleash Nehahra.  The Nehahra mod takes place five years later, where Max becomes ruler of the Quake dimension using powers granted to him by Nehahra, and human soldiers have set up a colony therein called Forge City. After hostile forces overrun the city, Jack Torres escapes and navigates through the levels of the Nehahra campaign with some help from the surviving soldiers, collecting power-up artifacts and slaying the hostile monsters he encounters. Among these include human-ogre hybrids, who have now begrudgingly accepted Maxwell's command after being created and later shunned by Archgaunt Hierarch Zagheida, the former cultist leader who was killed late in the film. After Jack kills General Ghoro, the leader of the knights from the film, Maxwell schemes to use him to kill Nehahra. For while Nehahra granted Maxwell far more power than he himself possesses, he also made Maxwell unable to kill him directly. Wanting to be beholden to no one, Max secretly guides Jack to Nehahra's Den, where Jack kills Nehahra. In the final level, Maxwell decides to take care of Jack Torres himself in a battle of "cat and mouse", but despite Maxwell's constant teleportation and multiple lives, Jack manages to finally slay the immortal human tyrant and free the innumerable spirits he held captive. With Max dead, Torres's life on Earth awaits him, but he can't help but feel taunted by a Gaunt proverb that Max repeated to Bent just before he ended his life: "Death is just the beginning".

Shanghai Noon
  In 1881, Chon Wang (pronounced as John Wayne) played by Chan is a Chinese [[Imperial Guards Brigade|Imperial Guard]] in the [[Forbidden City]]. After Princess Pei-Pei (Liu) for whom Wang has affection, is abducted and taken to the United States, the [[Guangxu Emperor|Emperor of China]] sends three of his guards along with the Royal Interpreter to retrieve her. Wang is not one of the three, but he tells the Captain of the Imperial Guards that it was his fault the princess was kidnapped and insists on joining them. The Captain first refuses, but when the Royal Interpreter, Wang's uncle, offers to allow Wang to come help with the baggage, the Captain agrees in the hopes that the "foreign devils" would get rid of Wang. In [[Nevada]], Roy O'Bannon (Wilson) is an outlaw who, with his gang, hijacks the train Wang is on. When Wallace, a new member of Roy's gang, kills Wang's uncle, Wang chases the outlaws down. However, the gang is well-armed and Wang's only choice is to unhinge the cars and get away on the engine. In the process, Wallace takes over the gang from Roy, and they leave him buried up to his chin in the desert sand. Meanwhile, Pei-Pei, who was tricked into believing she was freely escaping her arranged marriage in China, finds out she has been kidnapped by an agent of Lo Fong, who ran away from the Forbidden City and was viewed as a traitor by the Chinese.  When Wang finds Roy buried in the sand, he demands to know the direction to [[Carson City]]. Roy tells him that the city is on the other side of a mountain. Wang puts two chop sticks in Roy's mouth for him to dig himself out. When Wang comes out the other side of the mountain, he gets involved with a [[Sioux]] tribe by saving a boy chased by the [[Crow Nation|Crow]] tribe and ends up reluctantly marrying the tribe chief's daughter, Falling Leaves. Wang finds a small town in the area, where he encounters Roy in a tavern. He confronts him, and ends up starting a fight with him that turns into a barroom brawl. The two of them get sent to jail, and after Falling Leaves helps them escape, they become friends. Roy trains Wang in the ways of the cowboy assisted by Falling Leaves.   When they get to Carson City, Roy discovers that both he and Wang, now identified as the "Shanghai Kid" are wanted by Lo Fong's ally [[U.S. Marshals|Marshal]] Nathan Van Cleef, and the two of them narrowly escape. They go to a bordello (which Roy describes as his "hideout"), but after a drunken encounter by Wang, the Marshal eventually catches and arrests them. They find out that Lo Fong is behind the kidnapping of the princess. As they are about to be hanged, Wang manages to break himself free and after Falling Leaves shoots Roy loose, they escape the execution site. Wang, upset over Roy previously telling one of the prostitutes at the bordello he was not Wang's friend, rides off alone to find the princess. When he finds her in Lo Fong's labour camp, she tells him that she does not wish to return to China. Fong finds out about Wang and attacks him. However, Roy, who has followed Wang, saves him from Fong and the two reunite.  The next day, the two partners go to the ransom point, the Carson City Mission church. The three imperial guards arrive with the gold, and Lo Fong has the princess in hand. However, a simple exchange becomes complicated when Wang shows up and Roy points a gun towards Fong. Wang tells his fellow guards that he will not allow them to bring the princess back to China. As the Chinese and Lo Fong fight amongst themselves, Van Cleef arrives and engages Roy in a gunfight. After Roy is limited to one remaining bullet, Van Cleef simultaneously fires both of his guns but Roy (unscathed due to all of Van Cleef's shots missing him and going through the priest's robe he wore for a disguise) shoots him in the heart, through his sheriff's star. Wang fights the Imperial Guards whilst Lo Fong chases Pei-Pei through the rafters of the church, but eventually the Guards allow Wang to go to her aid instead. Wang fights Lo Fong to the bell tower, and Pei-Pei is wounded in the fight. Wang ultimately kills Lo Fong by dismantling the bell, causing it to hang him. After the fight, the Imperial Guards agree to let Pei-Pei remain in Nevada to help the enslaved Chinese people.  Wallace and his gang also come up to the church, and demand that Roy and Wang come out and fight. But when the two of them get outside the church to face Wallace, Natives from all around surround the gang. At a Chinese cultural celebration Roy thanks Falling Leaves for saving him and they engage in a passionate kiss. At the same time, Pei-Pei holds a smiling Wang. In the final scene, Roy (who reveals his real name to be [[Wyatt Earp]]) and Wang are shown as sheriffs and ride off to catch a new band of train robbers.  
Shadow of the Vampire
 In 1921, German director [[F. W. Murnau]] takes his cast and crew on-location in [[Czechoslovakia]] to shoot ''[[Nosferatu]]'', an unauthorized version of [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel ''[[Dracula]]''. Murnau keeps his team in the dark about their schedule and the actor playing the [[vampire]] [[Count Orlok]]. It is left to the film's other main actor, [[Gustav von Wangenheim]], to explain that the lead is an obscure [[German people|German]] theater performer named [[Max Schreck]], who is a [[character actor]]. To involve himself fully in his role, Schreck will only appear amongst the cast and crew in makeup, and will never break character.   After filming scenes in a studio with leading actress [[Greta Schröder]], who is displeased about leaving Berlin, Murnau's team travels to the remote inn where they will be staying and shooting further scenes. The landlady becomes distressed at Murnau removing crucifixes around the inn, and the cameraman, Wolfgang Muller, falls into a strange, hypnotic state. Gustav discovers a bottle of blood amongst the team's food supplies, and Murnau delivers a caged ferret in the middle of the night.   One night, Murnau rushes his team up to an old [[Slovakia|Slovak]] castle for the first scene with the vampire. Schreck appears for the first time, and his appearance and behavior impress and disturb them. The film's producer, [[Albin Grau]], suspects that Schreck is not a German theater actor, and is confused when Murnau tells him that he originally found Schreck in the castle. Soon after the completion of the scene, Wolfgang is found collapsed in a dark tunnel. Upon returning to the inn, the landlady appears frightened by his pale, weak appearance, and mutters "Nosferatu" while clutching at a [[rosary]].  Whilst filming a dinner scene between Gustav and Count Orlok, Murnau startles Gustav, making him cut his finger. Schreck reacts wildly at the sight of the blood, and tries drinking from Gustav's wound. The [[Electric generator|generator]] powering the lights fails and when the lights return, Schreck has pinned Wolfgang to the floor, apparently draining his blood. Albin orders filming ended for the night, and the crew rushes from the castle, leaving Schreck behind. Schreck examines the camera equipment, fascinated by footage of a sunrise.  Schreck is in fact an actual vampire, and Murnau has struck a deal with him in order to create the most realistic vampire film possible. Murnau has promised him Greta as a reward, but Schreck remains a difficult star. With Wolfgang near death, Murnau is forced to bring in another cinematographer, [[Fritz Arno Wagner]]. During Murnau's absence, Schreck approaches Albin and the screenwriter, Henrik Galeen. They invite Schreck to join them, and they question Schreck, believing he is still in character. Schreck points out Dracula's loneliness and the sadness of Dracula trying to remember how to perform everyday activities. When they ask how he became a vampire, Schreck says it was a woman. A bat flies by and Schreck catches it, sucking its blood. The others are impressed by what they assume is talented acting.  The production moves to [[Heligoland]] to film the final scenes, and Murnau admits Schreck's true nature to Albin and Fritz. The two realise they are trapped on the island, leaving no choice but to complete the film and give Greta to the vampire if they wish to survive. Greta becomes hysterical after noticing Schreck casts no reflection. Murnau, Albin and Fritz drug her, and film the scene as Schreck feeds on Greta, killing her, but the laudanum in her blood puts Schreck to sleep. At dawn, the remaining three attempt to open a door and let in sunlight to destroy Schreck. Schreck previously cut the chain, having learned of their trickery. Schreck kills Fritz and Albin while Murnau continues filming. Henrik and the crew arrive in time to lift the door and flood the set with sunlight, destroying Schreck while Murnau films his death.

 [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] Detective John Shaft II ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) is called in to investigate the [[Racism|racially motivated]] murder of Trey Howard ([[Mekhi Phifer]]), committed by Walter Wade, Jr. ([[Christian Bale]]), the son of a wealthy real estate tycoon. Shaft briefly meets a potential eyewitness to the murder, Diane Palmieri ([[Toni Collette]]), but she disappears soon after and cannot be found for the trial. Wade is released on [[bail]] and flees to [[Switzerland]].  Two years later, Wade returns and Shaft rearrests him for leaving the country. During his temporary incarceration at police headquarters, Wade meets Peoples Hernandez ([[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]), a [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] drug lord. Wade relinquishes his passport and is released on bail again; in frustration Shaft resigns from the police force, promising to bring Wade to justice on his own terms. Worried that Shaft might find the missing eyewitness, Wade hires Peoples to find and kill her first.  Shaft continues his search for Diane, enlisting the help of his friends Detective Carmen Vasquez ([[Vanessa Williams|Vanessa L. Williams]]) and taxi driver Rasaan ([[Busta Rhymes]]). While visiting Diane's uncooperative mother, Shaft and Carmen realize they are being followed by officers Jack Roselli ([[Dan Hedaya]]) and Jimmy Groves ([[Ruben Santiago-Hudson]]), who have been paid by Peoples to follow Shaft and get to Diane. Shaft finally finds her, but before they can talk, they are attacked by Peoples's men. In the shootout, Shaft kills Peoples's younger brother. Shaft, Diane, Rasaan, and Diane's brother manage to escape to Rasaan's apartment, but they are followed by Roselli and Groves. While at the apartment, Diane confesses that she saw the entire murder, and kept silent in return for a payoff from Wade's father.  When Peoples arrives at the location, another shootout takes place. Roselli and Groves, outed as corrupt, are killed by Carmen. In a face-off between Shaft and Peoples, Peoples insinuates that he's been working for Wade, and Shaft kills him. Wade's trial finally arrives. Before it can begin, however, he is gunned down by Trey's mother, Carla Howard ([[Lynne Thigpen]]). In the police station, Shaft reiterates to Carmen that he prefers to be a private detective. A woman arrives, asking for Shaft to help her, claiming to have an [[Domestic violence|abusive]] boyfriend. Shaft is initially reluctant, but when he sees her injury, he decides to help her anyway. Shaft, along with his uncle, [[John Shaft I]] ([[Richard Roundtree]]) and Rasaan, go together to confront the abusive boyfriend.

Shaapa
 ''Shaapa'' is a poignant story of a man (Ramesh as Shekhar) emotionally abused during this childhood by his father and how he struggles to fight his inner demons through his adult life. The story is juxtaposed on the backdrop of the Cauvery river water dispute between [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] states.  Ramesh plays Shekhar, a man afflicted by his childhood memories of being emotionally abused by his father (played by Jai Jagdish). Often during his childhood, Shekhar was pointed out to be the reason for anything that went wrong with their family. Years after his father's death, he continues to hear his father's voice in his head that keeps telling him that he's useless and that he'd never achieve anything in his life and that he'd be a failure. To add to it, the memories of his step-mother (whom he is shown to love a lot but who dies) keep telling him that whatever he tries to beget in life, will be lost.  Shekhar is shown to free sheep from the butcher's each day by paying for the sheep, so it can remain alive, much to the amusement of the butcher.  Enter Kaveri (Anu Prabhakar), a doctor who believes in working for social causes like widow remarriage. They get on very well. She also teaches him to play the flute (which he was keen to learn in his childhood but was discouraged by his father). He also takes her to his widowed sister so Kaveri can convince her to remarry someone. Over the entire period of their acquaintance, Shekhar can never bring himself to let Kaveri know that he's in love with her for the fear that he might lose her just as he lost his beloved step-mother.  At one point, Kaveri has to leave for Bengaluru and she shares her feelings in a letter that she gives him. The packet also contains a flute which Ramesh notices, but he doesn't notice the letter.  The "father's voice in the head" begins to haunt him even more and he decides to consult a psychiatrist (played by Avinash), who offers him advice on how to overcome his situation. 4 years later, he meets Kaveri again and much to his pleasant surprise he gets to know that she's still unmarried. He invites her to his place for dinner on a Diwali night. Kaveri is welcomed by Shekhar and the cook (played by K S Ashwath). After dinner, Shekhar proposes marriage to her in a creative way, only to realize that she's engaged to Ravi, a mechanical engineer from Chennai (played by B C Patil). Shekhar gets to know that Kaveri loved him too and gets to know about the letter that he missed. As Kaveri prepares to leave, Ravi comes to pick her up. The intended metaphor of 2 people (Ravi from Chennai and Shekhar from Karnataka) fighting for Kaveri and the Cauvery water dispute between the 2 states becomes more and more apparent from this point.  Shekhar is also in a bit of financial trouble because of dropping coffee prices (he owns a coffee export firm) and his bankers are keen to be repaid by him for the loan he obtained.  Kaveri gets married to Ravi, only to realize that he's only interested in money and doesn't really love her. He also tries to wean her away from her social services and persuades her to move to London with him so she can have a lucrative medical career there which she doesn't agree to initially. But subsequently she bows to his pressure and leaves for Chennai to get her Visa. On the way she meets Shekhar and tells him of her and Ravi's plans. Shekhar's determined not to lose her (he loves her and has to convince himself that he's not a loser). He abandons his errand midway and rushes back to his place with a plan to kill Ravi, buys a revolver and hides in a cupboard at  Ravi's home trying to shoot him. Caught between conflicting ideologies ("it's ok to kill if the reason is your survival" and "one should never harm anyone"), he manages to flee Ravi's place in the nick of time managing to evade Ravi's rifle.  He loses his company and all his property to the bank when his coffee godown is flooded by the river.  Shekhar is still determined not to let go of Kaveri (which is shown through a group of people protesting against the release of Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu). He takes the butcher's help (who is shown to have been an aide of an underworld don a few years ago) to kill Ravi and asks him not to leave behind any clue. The butcher is amused to see the change in ideology in Shekhar (he asks him "Why should I kill him?" to which Shekhar says "I have to live").  The butcher plants nails beneath the jeep at Ravi's house and enters to kill him. Meanwhile, Kaveri has got the visa, but she decides that going to London is something that she'd rather not do, goes to Shekhar's place and tells him of her plan. She says that she'll head back to her home and tell Ravi all about it. Shekhar tells her not to go to her home that night (knowing that the butcher is out to kill Ravi that night). She doesn't heed him.  At Ravi's place, there is a scuffle between the butcher and Ravi. Ravi is killed and as he's making his getaway, he's caught at the doorstep by Kaveri, whom the butcher promptly shoots down. At that moment Shekhar enters, aghast that Kaveri is dying, shoots the butcher down and tries to rush her to a hospital. With the punctured wheels on the vehicle, he's not able to and she dies en route.  The last scene shows him spending 14 years in the jail for murder. Upon release he is shown jumping into the Cauvery river to commit suicide, and a symbolic uniting with Kaveri is shown.  
Shadow Magic
 The film is set in [[Beijing]], 1902, in the last years of the [[Qing Dynasty]].  A young portrait photographer, Liu Jinglun (Xia Yu), chances on a newly arrived Englishman, Raymond Wallace (Jared Harris) in the capital.  Liu, a self-learner of rudimentary English, is keen on new technology and gadgets, while Raymond has brought along the latest [[motion picture]] [[movie camera|camera]] and [[movie projector|projector]] with some [[silent film]] shorts from the West. Liu is fascinated by the "shadow magic" and offers to help Raymond bring in audiences for his theatre.  Hence Liu and Raymond become partners.  However, while the innovation thrills many, the more conservative Chinese in the capital frown upon the creation as a Western "pollutant".  Liu falls in love with Ling (Xing Yufei), the daughter of a well-respected [[Beijing Opera]] star, Lord Tan Xinpei ([[Li Yusheng]]).  However, as he is poor and only an apprentice at the photography shop, Liu has no chance of marrying Ling.  Instead, Liu's father and his boss at the Fengtai photography shop, Master Ren ([[Liu Peiqi]]), try to arrange a marriage for him with an older [[widow]], Jiang ([[Fang Qingzhuo]]).  When Master Ren finds out Liu has been working for a foreigner dabbling with "shadow magic", he becomes infuriated. Liu tries to reason with Master Ren, explaining to him that this "shadow magic" is an innovation in the world of photography, and once Liu learns more about it they should incorporate it into their own business. Master Ren is not swayed, however, and dismisses him. Because of this, Liu is also disowned by his father.  Liu and Raymond's friendship becomes tested as he feels the strain of being branded a traitor in his own country.  Liu, Raymond, Master Ren and Lord Tan are all invited to the [[Forbidden City]] to entertain the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] during her birthday celebrations.  Master Ren and his apprentices take a photograph of the Empress Dowager, while Lord Tan performs his opera number.  Liu and Raymond project some Western film shorts to the amusement of the Empress Dowager and her coterie.  However, hand-cranking causes the projector to catch fire, the screening is ruined midway, and Liu is badly burnt.  The Qing officials are incensed that Liu and Raymond nearly cause deaths during the birthday celebration of the esteemed Dowager, but the Dowager pardons Liu for his naivety.  Raymond, however, is immediately [[banishment|banish]]ed from China.  Half a year passes, and Liu recovers from his burns.  Raymond, fondly remembering their friendship and times in China, sends him the nitrate negatives of movies they shot together in Beijing, imploring that he should not let the work they started together die.  Liu decides to try making a film projector himself and successfully screens these local movies to a group of Beijing natives.  Liu's father decides to support him in this venture and Ling visits him on the sly at the projection room, where they kiss.  The film ends with the Beijing natives gradually accepting the motion picture technology, once they see how beautifully it captures the majesty of the Chinese landscape.  At the film's end, [[Intertitle|caption]]s reveal that Liu and Master Ren become the first Chinese to shoot a motion picture.  The film, starring Lord Tan, is the now famous ''[[The Battle of Dingjunshan (film)|The Battle of Dingjunshan]]''.

They then meet Barbara's brother Doughy ([[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]]), an inept security guard who recently lost his job patrolling a shopping mall and is working to find the killer; however, he believes Screw's death was a harmless prank. As the group talks, they do not notice Hagitha's cameraman being murdered. As the day progresses, more and more students are murdered. While in class, each of the group receives a letter from the killer, revealing he knows a secret about them.

However, Barbara suffers an [[Allergy|allergic reaction]] to bee stings before the killer can murder her. As the rest of the party people leave, Martina makes a move on Dawson, before they find Slab has abused [[steroid]]s, causing him to explode. Martina and Dawson then are chased by the killer, as Hagitha and Doughy play strip poker nearby instead of investigating the murders. Martina and Dawson defeat the killer as Hagitha and Doughy arrive. The killer is revealed as Hardy, Doughy's "evil twin cousin", whom Doughy is going to let get away with the murders, but Hagitha accidentally shoots Hardy before leaving Doughy for a pizza boy.

While in [[Hainan]] working on a new script, Liu Dawei (Fu) assigns young and beautiful Li Xiaodan (Liu) to him as an assistant. Yazhou and Xiaodan are mutually attracted to each other, but Yazhou is already married to Song Xiaoying (Xu), with whom he has a daughter. To break off the connection, he changes his plans and returns to Beijing. However, as soon as Yazhou and Xiaoying return to Beijing, they begin having an affair.  When Xiaoying finds out about Yazhou's affair, she is furious and initially demands a divorce. Relations between Yazhou and Xiaoying become extremely strained. They separate, and Xiaoying eventually accepts Yazhou's affair for the sake of their young daughter Yueyue. Despite Xiaoying's tolerance, Yazhou remains caught between the two women, on one hand being spoiled by Xiaodan and, on the other, being an attentive father in front of Xiaoying and Yueyue. Even with Xiaodan demanding marriage, Yazhou finds himself unable to divorce his wife, due to the harmful impact their separation has already had on Yueyue.  Xiaoying immerses herself in renovating the home she and Yazhou purchased before their fall out. When she injures her back after falling off a ladder, Yazhou is forced to leave Xiaodan to care for Xiaoying.

The Skulls (film)
 Luke McNamara ([[Joshua Jackson]]) is a student with aspirations to become a lawyer. A "townie" who grew up on the "wrong side of the tracks", he did well enough in school to attend college on a scholarship where he is a champion rower. His best friends at college are his love interest Chloe ([[Leslie Bibb]]), and Will ([[Hill Harper]]) who is the coxswain of the Bulldog 8's rowing team of which Luke is the captain (at the victory party for the 8's, Chloe is revealed to come from a wealthy family which is why Luke is reluctant to reveal his feelings for her). Luke's friendships hit the rocks when he is invited to join a secret society known as "The Skulls". After Luke passes the first part of the initiation process - theft from a rival secret society together with boxing prodigy Caleb Mandrake ([[Paul Walker]]) as his co-conspirator and alleged "soulmate", and being lectured in the secret ritual room by a senior Skull that is standing in front of a wall with the word "WAR" engraved into it in huge capital letters. A senior Skull explains to Luke that the Skulls require their members to prove themselves in war. Luke has a falling out with Will when the latter realizes that Luke has become a Skull.  Luke quickly strikes up a friendship with his alleged soulmate. Caleb's father, Litten Mandrake ([[Craig T. Nelson]]), is the current Chairman of the Skulls and a Federal Court Judge who is pushing for a position in the Supreme Court, and his partner Senator Ames Levritt ([[William Petersen]]), takes an interest in Luke. Eventually Will, who has been conducting research on the Skulls for some time, discovers their secret ritual room.  Will gets caught in the room by Caleb and in the ensuing struggle he falls and is knocked unconscious. Caleb is ordered to leave the room by his father, who then orders Skulls member and the University's [[Provost (education)|provost]] Martin Lombard ([[Christopher McDonald]]) to break Will's neck. The Skulls manage to move the body and make it look like Will committed suicide in his dorm room by hanging himself.    Luke is greatly troubled by the death of his best friend, especially because Will's family is the only family he had (due to the death of his parents at a young age), and becomes suspicious that Will was in fact murdered. He initially thinks that Caleb is guilty of the murder, and Caleb thinks that he himself is guilty since he assumed that Will was dead when he left the room. With the help of some of his 'townie' childhood friends who have turned petty crime into an art form (Luke also bribes them to help him by giving them the car he had been given by the Skulls, a [[Ford Thunderbird (third generation)|1963 Ford Thunderbird]] convertible as an apology for missing his friends birthday the week before), Luke obtains the Skulls security tapes that prove Lombard committed the murder and in trying to convince Caleb of the truth (that it was his father who was responsible for Will's death), Luke realizes how scared Caleb is of his father. Before Luke can show the evidence to police, the Skulls council, who know Luke has stolen the tapes, vote that he is no longer loyal (Litten Mandrake blackmailed Levritt with pictures of him and his much younger mistress to allow the vote to carry). When he does go to the police, the tape is switched by Detective Sparrow ([[Steve Harris (actor)|Steve Harris]]) and Luke is confined to a mental hospital under the control of the Skulls.    With the help of Levritt and Chloe, Luke manages to escape the hospital and he and Chloe survive an attempt on his life by Lombard who is shot and killed by Detective Sparrow (who it turns out is working for Levritt). Luke decides that his only option is to fight the Skulls by their own rules, and "bring war to them". He challenges Caleb to a duel at the Skulls' [[Deer Island (Thousand Islands)|private island]], by invoking rule 119. Litten tries to take his son's place in the duel but is denied the opportunity due to another Skull rule (119b, line 15). After Luke and Caleb take their ten paces and turn around, Luke drops his gun and tries to convince Caleb of the truth and that he is not responsible for Will's murder. Despite being pressured by Litten to kill Luke, Caleb cannot bring himself to pull the trigger. At this point, Litten grabs a pistol and attempts to shoot Luke himself, but before he can fire, Caleb shoots his own father. Caleb, mortified at what he has done, tries to kill himself but is stopped by Luke.    The film ends with Luke's realization that Senator Levritt waited to help him until he had no other choice but to duel and eliminate his rival (Caleb's father). Luke becomes disgusted with the order and refuses to participate further, despite threats from Levritt that he will be tracked down someday, and despite, or even because of, Levritt's offer that the Skulls will accept him because he has proven himself in war. As Luke walks away Levritt says to himself, "Well done son, well done". It has been speculated, because of this along with other incidents in the film (such as him comparing their backgrounds, Luke's unknown father situation, and Levritt taking an immediate liking to Luke), that Levritt may be Luke's father. The final shot of the film shows Luke reuniting with Chloe.  
Sleeping Bride
 On March 13, 1954, a passenger plane crashes in Japan, killing all but one passenger: a woman who is nine months pregnant. Ultimately she dies in a hospital, but her unborn daughter is saved. However, for a reason inexplicable by the science of the day, the daughter (named Yumi) does not wake up and is essentially in a comatose state. Her wealthy father has her placed in a hospital where she will be cared for indefinitely (and also offers a reward to anyone who can wake her) while he vanishes in search of a cure to her condition.  Seven years later (March 25, 1961) Yuichi (a boy who is roughly seven himself) is admitted to the same hospital (with asthma) and discovers Yumi. After being told of her condition and then reading the story of [[Sleeping Beauty]], he resolves to awaken Yumi by kissing her. Saying, "Wake up, I'm the prince," he kisses her on the lips. This has no effect, but Yuichi is undeterred, and makes a routine of this, even after he leaves the hospital, repeating the same line and kissing her. Although a nurse finds this "cute" and lets him continue, when Doctor Hikawa discovers his actions, he ejects Yuichi from the hospital, infuriated that Yuichi believes that he can awaken the girl, whom he himself could not awaken with all the powers of medical science.  For the next ten years Yuichi does not visit the hospital at all, until February 14, 1972 when he sees a new report on Yumi who, after 17 years, has still never awoken. Overcome by the memories of his childhood, Yuichi returns to the hospital, and although initially thwarted by a new (apparently American) nurse, he eventually resumes his ten-year-old routine, with similarly little results, although more genuine emotion. Doctor Hikawa &ndash; now a Director of the Hospital &ndash; gradually becomes aware of his actions.  After Yuichi accidentally kisses a girl at school as part of an elaborate setup on the part of his friends, he rushes to the hospital (it would appear he considered it an act of infidelity) despite the rain and late hour, and passionately kisses Yumi. He does not use the "Wake up, I'm the prince" line, but instead begs her (apparently in his thoughts), stating, "I'm no prince, I'm Yuichi Nasagawa, but please wake up, I want to talk to you." Though it would appear to have no effect at first, as Yuichi is leaving he notices some movement, and then he realises that Yumi has indeed awoken.  Promptly, the silent Yumi is besieged by a team of doctors and nurses who start to run series of tests, essentially ignoring and shutting out Yuichi. Yuichi, seeing that Yumi has been revived only to become some sort of human guinea pig, abducts her. Although Yumi has the mentality of a baby (even lacking the ability to walk or talk) they have a mutually enjoyable time together, until Yumi is reminded* of the crash-site in which her mother died, and is returned to the hospital by orderlies.  Yumi is seen in bed, at night, with her eyes open; Yumi does not sleep at all any more.  The next day (the "second day" that Yumi is awake), Yumi has advanced to the mentality of a young child, able to speak and read, and also an amazing talent for photo-realistic art, as she draws the image of her father. Yuichi returns after school and is immediately recognised by Yumi. They (this time by mutual consent, and accompanied by orderlies) walk outside in the grounds of the hospital. Upon sighting a bus (which Yumi seems to want to ride) Yuichi decides to give the orderlies (who have the air of cartoon comic-relief thugs to them) the slip, and does so successfully. They have an enjoyable "date" together (although Yumi is still only capable of conversing in simple terms).  By the third day Yumi has been discovered by the media and is being paraded all over for the press. Yuichi, Yuichi's nurse (who retired), and Yumi's father all witness the report on TV. Yuichi, once more, decides of his own accord that this is not "right" (although unlike when she was being tested, Yumi can clearly be seen to be distressed by many of the questions about her own genesis) and abducts Yumi once more. By this time Yumi has acquired the vocal and cognitive abilities approximately the same as other girls her age.  Yumi and Yuichi have their first conversation as intellectual equals. Yumi asks several philosophical questions about life and death. She declares that she only has two more days left before she falls asleep again (she gives no explanation as to how she acquired this knowledge, but she simply has it). Overall, she only has five days to be awake. She goes on to inquire about a strange emotion she has when she thinks of someone. After hearing the description, Yuichi explains the emotion is probably love. Yumi declares that, therefore, she is in love with Doctor Hikawa, shattering Yuichi.  Yuichi comes to the conclusion that someone told Yumi that she could only be awake for five days while she was asleep, and as such she believes it, but it is not true. He urges Hikawa to marry Yumi, as Yumi apparently loves him, and Yuichi's primary concern is Yumi's happiness. Hikawa does not believe in the five-day limit either, or that Yumi really loves him. Yumi hears their conversation through the door and is herself, heart-broken. She attempts to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff, but she is stopped by Yuichi.  On the fourth day, Yuichi's old nurse returns to the hospital to see Yumi, who is now in a state of depression. After hearing the story from Yuichi, she reveals that Hikawa had been doing something sexual to her at night, and that she left the hospital upon discovering this. Yuichi is infuriated, he confronts Hikawa and punches him, knocking him to the floor. Hikawa does not get up, but simply talks, his head lying down, not facing anything, of how Yumi was abandoned by her parents, and God. She was left only with him, but he was unable to help her. He explains that it was because he was unwilling to admit his impotency that he did what he did.  Yuichi returns to Yumi. Yumi explains that she heard someone, for a long time, praying for her to wake up, and then felt something that made her feel very warm. She thought this was Doctor Hikawa, and as such, that she loved him. Yuichi kisses her, and she realises the kiss was what made her warm, and by extension, it was Yuichi who prayed to her, and he whom she loved all along. They continue to kiss, and presumably make love. The same night they announce to Yuichi's mother that they are getting married.  On the fifth and final day of the film, Yuichi and Yumi are wed. Although Yumi's father watches and is happy to see that his daughter has found happiness, he does not reveal himself, but simply leaves once more, content. Hikawa arrives after the wedding and speaks alone to Yuichi about the fifth day limit. While he maintains that it is simply autosuggestion, he reminds Yuichi that it is real for Yumi. When Yuichi asks what to do, all Hikawa can suggest is prayer.  That night as Yumi and Yuichi depart on their honeymoon on a train, Yumi states, "I will be with Yuichi forever," and that she remembers everything about him, even in sleep, going on to list all the things they did together. Yumi's speech is rather bittersweet. Despite the fact she appears genuinely happy at moments, she is also on the verge of tears. Yuichi has a similar mix of anxiety and sorrow. Yumi inquires if Yuichi believes in God. Yuichi replies, that if God is the one who only allows her to be awake for five days, then he does not believe in him. Yumi says she will tell God that the world is "very big," paraphrasing something Yuichi told her before. Finally, she states she will thank God for meeting Yuichi as well, and then she drifts off to sleep. Yuichi tries to wake her, eventually even resorting to the sleeping-beauty kiss. Yumi opens her eyes briefly and says, "I… am… happy," before falling asleep once more, forever.  Twenty seven years later (August 7, 1999), an aged Yuichi, now a scientist, returns home from work and talks to his wife. Yumi, herself aged, but not dramatically (her hair has greyed, but presumably her face has not wrinkled since she has not been moving) and still sleeps. As he is showing her a picture of a friend's son, he notices she has stopped breathing – Yumi is dead.  As Yuichi watches the video of Yumi talking to the press (before he, in his youth, liberates her – i.e. the third day) he explains by monologue that after her death he had an autopsy performed on Yumi. When her brain was removed, it was completely transparent, and beautiful. He believes that although she was only awake for five days, she was happier than anyone else.  The film ends, replaying the earlier footage of Yumi and Yuichi running from the press. Yumi happily calls, "Yuichi!" and he retorts, "The world is very big, Yumi."

One such patient, the ever-negative Mr. Finch ([[Bert Remsen]]), seems to dislike Emily & Sam's constant intrusions into his solitary life, but with time and devotion Emily helps Mr. Finch to see the beauty and value in the world around him. Their new-found relationship proves to be the turning point for Emily, and, with Mr. Finch's help and support, Emily's faith in her own talent is restored.

Boris hires Vinny and Sol, two small-time crooks, to rob Franky while he is at the bookies.

The wounded Boris arrives with an [[assault rifle]] with a [[grenade launcher]] looking for the diamond back but is shot and killed by Tony, wounding Tyrone at the same time. Sol and Vinny leave a wounded Tyrone and escape with the diamond, which Vinny hides in his pants. When Tony catches up to them, they tell him that the diamond is back at their pawn shop. Once there, they produce the diamond, but it is promptly swallowed by a dog that Vinny got from the travellers. Avi fires at the fleeing dog, accidentally killing Tony. He gives up and returns to New York.  Mickey refuses to fight again unless Turkish buys a better caravan for his mother, but Turkish has no money left since Brick Top stole his savings. Furious, Brick Top has his men vandalize Turkish's gambling arcade and burn down Mickey's mother's caravan while she is asleep inside. Mickey agrees to fight to avoid more carnage, but gets so drunk after his mother's wake that Turkish fears he will not make it to the fourth round. If he fails to go down as agreed, Brick Top's men will execute Turkish, Tommy, Mickey, and the entire campsite of travellers. Mickey makes it to the fourth round, when he suddenly knocks out his opponent. Outside the arena, Brick Top and his men are killed by the travellers. Mickey has bet on himself to win, and waited until the fourth round to allow the travellers time to ambush and kill Brick Top's men at the campsite.  The next morning, Turkish and Tommy find the travellers' campsite deserted. When confronted by the police, they cannot explain why they are there, until Vinny's dog suddenly arrives and they claim to be walking it. Sol and Vinny are arrested when the police find Franky and Tony's bodies in their car. Turkish and Tommy take the dog to a veterinarian to extract a [[squeaky toy]] that it had swallowed, and discover the diamond in its stomach, as well. They consult Doug about selling the diamond and he calls Avi, who returns to London.

Space Cowboys
 In 1958, two [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] pilots and aspiring astronauts, William "Hawk" Hawkins ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]) and Frank Corvin ([[Clint Eastwood]]), are testing a modified X-plane when Hawk decides to try to break a height record.  The plane stalls and they are forced to eject, narrowly missing a [[Boeing B-50 Superfortress|B-50 Superfortress]] piloted by navigator "Tank" Sullivan ([[James Garner]]) as they parachute to safety. On the ground, Frank punches Hawk for putting their lives at risk, but their fight is broken up by engineer Jerry O'Neill ([[Donald Sutherland]]). Their supervising officer, Bob Gerson ([[James Cromwell]]), chastises Hawk for his recklessness, before taking them to a press conference, where it is announced that the Air Force will no longer be involved in space flight tests as this has now been handed off to the newly created [[NASA]], ending the four's dreams of reaching space.  In the present day, NASA is tasked to prevent a Soviet communications satellite, IKON, from decaying out of orbit and crashing to Earth. The design of the satellite's electronics are archaic and based on those of [[Skylab]] that Frank had developed. Bob, now a project manager at NASA, sends astronaut Sara Holland ([[Marcia Gay Harden]]) to request Frank's help. Frank is initially hostile as he still despises Bob, but agrees to put aside his differences to help with the current situation. However, Frank insists that he have the help of his "Team Daedalus" including Hawk, Tank, and Jerry. Bob agrees to this, though discreetly plans to have younger astronauts shadow the four and learn from them so as to replace Frank's team before launch. When the press learn of Frank's team, however, the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] convinces Bob that Frank's team must be part of the mission for good publicity. The old and young teams, though initially competitive, soon work together, with the older astronauts showing off skills learned without the aid of a computer. As they train and undergo examinations, Hawk is found to have [[pancreatic cancer]] and given only eight months to live, but is still considered flight-worthy.  The launch is scheduled, and the [[space shuttle]] ''Daedalus'' successfully launches into orbit. They find the satellite but all agree it looks nothing like a communication satellite. They secure the satellite with the shuttle's loading arm and begin repairs, but soon find it houses six nuclear missiles, relics from the [[Cold War]] and a violation of the [[Outer Space Treaty]]. The mission is quickly put under secrecy. Frank discovers that the control system for the satellite originated from Bob's own files and was stolen by the [[KGB]], and that the satellite's computers will launch the missiles at predetermined targets if the satellite falls out of orbit. NASA and the crew devise a plan to use the payload-assist rockets to push the satellite out of orbit and into deep space. However, as they prepare for this maneuver, one of the younger astronauts, Ethan Glance ([[Loren Dean]]), acting under Bob's original orders, tries to put the satellite into stable orbit himself, which is mistimed and sets off a chain reaction: the satellite collides with the shuttle, damaging most of the shuttle's computer systems and engines, destroying the solar panels on the satellite, and sending it faster into a decay orbit, while Ethan is knocked out and dragged along with the satellite.  While Tank and Jerry tend to the other young astronaut Roger Hines ([[Courtney B. Vance]]), who suffered a concussion on the impact, Frank and Hawk make a space walk and reach the satellite in time to activate a booster rocket and slow down the orbit. As they see to Ethan, the two realize that there is no way to restablize the orbit of the satellite without power, and the only option is to have someone ride on the satellite as they fire the missiles' engines so that it falls into deep space. Hawk quickly volunteers to sacrifice himself, hoping that he will be able to land himself on the moon to fulfill his life's dream. After helping Hawk to rig the satellite for launch, Frank takes Ethan back to the shuttle to be tended to. Frank, Tank, and Jerry say their goodbyes to Hawk as he engages the rockets, successfully propelling the missiles away from Earth.  Frank, Tank, and Jerry now work to bring the shuttle back to Earth, with the plan to achieve a low enough altitude to allow the shuttle to be evacuated over water since landing it would be difficult. Frank successfully pilots the shuttle to reenter orbit but with too fast a speed. After safely bailing out Ethan and Roger, Tank and Jerry stay with Frank regardless of the risk. Frank recalls a maneuver Hawk had used before, purposely [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stalling]] the shuttle to drop its speed quickly and allowing him to land the shuttle safely. The crew is welcomed back as heroes.  Later, Frank talks with his wife Barbara and contemplates if Hawk made it to the Moon. The film ends with the [[Frank Sinatra]] song "[[Fly Me to the Moon]]", zooming in on the surface of the Moon showing that Hawk had indeed arrived, having died while peacefully watching the Earth.

Spy Games
 Harry ([[Bill Pullman]]) is a seasoned [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent who is looking to forget his past and become his cover identity—a jazz club owner in [[Helsinki, Finland]]. Natasha ([[Irène Jacob]]) is a young, ambitious [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR (KGB)]] agent who is looking to secure a future for herself amidst the chaos of the new [[Russian Federation]] and her floundering intelligence agency. Originally assigned to spy on Harry, Natasha has fallen in love with the object of her spying, and her assignment has led to a torrid love affair between the two. Like all couples, they are keeping secrets from each other—but in their case, the secrets have international implications.  Harry's life with Natasha is disrupted when a young, over-zealous CIA agent, Dave ([[Glenn Plummer]]), comes to Helsinki to intercept a videotape encoded with state secrets en route from [[New York City]]. The videotape's hidden code is so sensitive that those who come in contact with the tape are soon killed. Dave is pursuing the unsuspecting courier, a manic ex-bond trader named Max ([[Bruno Kirby]]), who is unaware of what he is carrying. Max took the job by chance, following his recent prison term for stock market fraud. Natasha sees the videotape as a possible ticket out of the SVR and into the [[United States]] and the [[American Dream]].

Harry's only plan is to prevent Natasha from getting herself killed—or worse, from leaving him for U.S.<ref name="imdb"/><ref name="pullman"></ref>  
The Specials (film)
 The superhero team the Specials has never achieved great popularity or prestige, partially because unlike other super teams it is not corporation-friendly and has been unable to  secure merchandising deals. Without the corporate or private financial resources of more well-established teams, the Specials often get underrated villains, small disasters, and the occasional alien invasion to repel — all of which are deemed too low-priority for other superhero teams. Even the members with formidable  powers have shortcomings that prevented a transition for the team as a whole. Because team-members such as the Strobe, Ms. Indestructible, The Weevil, Deadly Girl, Power Chick, Amok, Alien Orphan, and Eight all possess various social dysfunctions, they've never quite broken through the superhero glass ceiling.  The team welcomes Nightbird ([[Jordan Ladd]]), the group's newest member, a teenage girl with "bird powers." Nightbird, who idolizes the Specials, soon realizes that her heroes do not function as a harmonious team but like a dysfunctional family. One of the two greatest points of stress in the team is the slowly fracturing relationship between the Strobe ([[Thomas Haden Church]]) and Ms. Indestructible ([[Paget Brewster]]), a married couple at the core of the team. Also problematic is that the Weevil is trying to negotiate an exit into a more high-profile superhero team, playing both on his own popularity and his legacy status from following in his father's footsteps.  The cracks begin to show as they prepare to attend a dinner in their honor thrown by Kosgrov Toys, which is releasing a line of [[action figures]] based upon the group. The event is a travesty. It becomes quickly apparent that Kosgrov did little research on the Specials, and low-balled the production by utilizing cheap accessories and recycled parts.  Worse yet, the leader of the Specials, the Strobe, discovers that his wife, Ms. Indestructible, is cheating on him with the most popular member of the group, The Weevil ([[Rob Lowe]]). In a fit of anger, the Strobe disbands the group, and the members go their own ways.  The Strobe goes to Zip Boy's (Barry Del Sherman) house and asks for a job at New Standards Inc., a plastics company in [[Detroit]], denying there's a problem by saying that he's great, now that he has "a great new job as a welding asshole." Ms. Indestructible spends the night watching her old wedding video and crying over a glass of wine.  The Strobe's brother, Minute Man ([[James Gunn (filmmaker)|James Gunn]]), who had had a crush on the new girl, Nightbird, ultimately falls into the arms of Deadly Girl ([[Judy Greer]]), who was hurt to learn about Weevil and Ms. Indestructible. Meanwhile, Amok ([[Jamie Kennedy]]), Power Chick ([[Kelly Coffield Park|Kelly Coffield]]), Alien Orphan ([[Sean Gunn]]), and Mr. Smart ([[Jim Zulevic]]) indulge in a night of drinking and dancing.  During the disbandment, the Weevil finalizes his transfer to another superhero team, only to find that his negative press from the Specials still follows him. Reporters focus more on his controversy than his ability to apprehend villains, and the Weevil finds he has gone from being the top dog in a small team to the team runt in the larger one. The Strobe and Ms. Indestructible reconcile, and the Strobe renews his passion for justice instead of image.  The team is immediately called back into action and the heroes resolve to do the right thing not because it will bring popularity or glory, but because as misfits, they've become the champions of society's underdogs.  They exit to face down another crisis.  
Spring Forward
 Spring Forward is the story of the burgeoning friendship between two very different men, Murphy and Paul, who work for the parks department in a quaint New England town.  Paul is a short-tempered ex-convict recently released from prison for armed robbery, who is exploring his spiritual side hoping for atonement and a second chance. On his first day working in parks maintenance he is partnered with Murphy, a veteran groundskeeper, facing his advancing age and impending retirement. The day gets off to a rough start when Paul clashes with a condescending local business heir over a materials donation, loses his cool, announces he is quitting, and stalks off into the woods berating himself for always ruining everything.  Murphy follows him, defuses Paul's outburst and convinces him to stay.  Against the backdrop of the changing seasons the relationship between the men strengthens and develops more as father and son, poignant in contrast to Murphy's relationship with his dying homosexual son, whose impending death causes Murphy to doubt his past as a father and a man.  Working together through mundane days and personal crisis they share their lives, hopes, ambitions and regrets, as Paul learns to find stability and calm in his life and Murphy achieves acceptance and forgiveness for his mistakes.  The film ends with Paul presenting Murphy with a [[hamsa]] as a retirement gift and to signify the "helping hand" that Murphy has provided him through the past year.

State and Main
 Havoc is wrought on the inhabitants of a small New England town by a troubled film production. After the leading man's [[ephebophilia|penchant for underage girls]] gets them banished from their [[New Hampshire]] location, the crew relocates to the small town of [[Waterford, Vermont]], to finish shooting ''The Old Mill''.  As its title suggests, the film depends on the presence of a genuine mill, something the town is reported to possess. Unfortunately, with only days before principal photography begins, it becomes apparent that the mill in fact burned down decades ago.  Unfazed, the film's director, Walt Price ([[William H. Macy]]), places his faith in the ability of first-time screenwriter Joseph Turner White ([[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]) to alter the script. What he doesn't count on is White's apparently bottomless reserve of angst-fueled writer's block. A local bookseller, Annie Black ([[Rebecca Pidgeon]]), tries to provide White with inspiration.  The film's leading lady ([[Sarah Jessica Parker]]) refuses to do her contracted nude scene unless she's paid an additional $800,000, while a foreign cinematographer offends the locals by messing with a historic firehouse. Meanwhile, the leading man, Bob Barrenger ([[Alec Baldwin]]), dallies with Carla ([[Julia Stiles]]), a crafty local teen.  Everything comes to a head after Barrenger and Carla are injured in a car accident, which leads White (the only witness) to another emotional quandary and into the arms of Annie.  Meanwhile, a powerful movie producer ([[David Paymer]]) comes to town to help Price with the ensuing mess.  
Stickmen (film)
  The film begins with Thomas and Wayne playing a game of pool against two English men. They almost win but Wayne loses the game on the last shot due to overconfidence. Their friend Jack then arrives. His pool playing skills come to the attention of Holden ([[Kirk Torrance]]), who remarks to the bartender Dave (John Leigh) that the three friends might be good enough to play in "Daddy's game". "Daddy's game" turns out to be an underground pool tournament run by local Greek crime lord Daddy. Each team pays $500 to enter and the winner takes away $20,000 tax free. The three of them agree to enter under the name "Stickmen".  The boys leave the bar and go to a cafe, where they meet Sara ([[Anne Nordhaus]]), a waitress who takes a liking to Thomas. The next morning the three meet up for breakfast where Jack tells them that their first match in the pool tournament will be against two men called Jimmy and Eric, at the Princess Bar. Jack then leaves for work, where he ends up having sex with Karen ([[Simone Kessell]]) in his office. Thomas attends a course on "Coping with Redundancy" but is asked to leave. He runs into Sara, who is doing a management course. The two go for a cup of coffee, which Thomas reluctantly accepts because he has a girlfriend. Later that evening, Thomas accompanies Wayne to a job interview, which turns out to be an escort driver. He will be responsible for driving prostitutes Tess (Emma Nooyen) and Lulu (Luanne Gordon) to their jobs. The madam, Janelle, reveals that Daddy owns the brothel. Wayne gets the job.  Meanwhile, Dave is having trouble coming up with the rent for his bar, which he rents from Daddy. Holden turns up and after some friendly chitchat, tells Dave that the cheque bounced. He breaks Dave's thumb and promises him that if he doesn't get the money, the next one will be a beating.  The Stickmen turn up to their match at the Princess Bar, which appears to be a gay bar. They easily win the match and go back to celebrate at Dave's bar. Sara turns up and she and Thomas hit it off. Karen arrives and chats with Jack. Thomas and Sara, drunk, leave the bar. Holden tells Jack and Wayne that Daddy wants to meet them, and they agree to meet the next morning.  The next morning, Jack and Wayne turn up to Daddy's barber shop, which is in a small alley. Thomas doesn't show and it is revealed that he slept with Sara. Holden arrives and tells Jack and Wayne that their next match will be against the Men in Black, who are rumoured to be very good. They go inside and meet Daddy, who has two metal hooks instead of hands. He has a number of Greek thugs as bodyguards. He tells them that life is nothing without passion, and his passion is getting players together in his pool tournament.  Thomas returns home and finds his girlfriend Marie has packed up his stuff and wants him to leave, having suspected his infidelity. He arrives at the bar and is congratulated by Jack and Wayne for sleeping with Sara. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Sara and Karen know each other and are planning something.  The Men in Black, the Stickmen's next opponents, turn out to be two priests. They are humorous and good-natured even when the Stickmen beat them. Thomas goes to visit Sara and the two of them bond. Holden tells Jack that Daddy wants another meeting. Jack accompanies Holden and sees Daddy intimidating Dave while shaving him. Dave, who had previously been beaten up by Daddy's thugs, is given two days to get Daddy's money. Daddy then gives Jack a haircut while offering him a bet of $15,000 on the tournament. Jack protests that they don't have that kind of money but Daddy says that they can work out a payment plan. Feeling intimidated, Jack agrees to the bet.  The next morning at breakfast Jack breaks the news to the other two that their next match will be against "Caller" (Neville Stevenson), and he remarks that the only way they have a hope is if they win the toss. Sara tells Karen that she's not sure if she can go through with their plan. Karen's ex-boyfriend Hugh and his friend turn up and Sara leaves. She meets Thomas at the [[The Bucket Fountain|Bucket Fountain]] on [[Cuba Street, Wellington|Cuba Street]], where they agree to take their relationship to the next level (being boyfriend and girlfriend).  The next evening, Wayne rescues Lulu from a fat, drunken customer, who has passed out on top of her. He invites her to come and watch him play pool to cheer her up, and takes her home to get his cue. However, he finds that Tess, who had been living with him temporarily, has stolen most of his stuff. He explodes in a fit of anger, starts drinking and tells Lulu that Caller is too good and they can't beat him. After some encouragement from Lulu, he agrees to play.  Caller, it turns out, is a pierced, bare-chested pool player with dreadlocks who gets his nickname from [[Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#call shot|calling his shots]]. Wayne turns up drunk and announces to Thomas and Jack that he will play Caller. Jack objects, knowing that he is the only one who has a chance at winning, but Holden states that since Wayne has stepped up, he has to play. In a "drunken master" style, Wayne runs the table and beats Caller, who never gets a single shot. As Holden mentioned earlier in the film, New Zealand pub rules require a player who loses a game without sinking any of his balls to [[Debagging#New_Zealand_pool|drop his trousers]]. Caller appears to comply with the rule, but then punches Wayne in the face. In the resulting fight, Jack's hand is cut. Holden, backed up by two of Daddy's thugs wielding machetes, forces Caller to drop his trousers.  Due to Jack's injury, he is barely able to play pool, meaning that Thomas and Wayne will have to play in the semi-finals. Knowing that they have lost their star player, they decide to quit. Dave convinces them to keep playing by telling them that he gets to keep the bar if they win. He buys them matching jackets to wear to the finals.  At the semi-finals, Holden announces that their opponent is "Bastinados", who turn out to be Sara and Karen. The other match is the "Farmers" versus the "Bankers" (Hugh and his friend). Karen and Sara are exceptionally good, but Sara throws the game by sinking the cue ball on the same shot as the 8-ball. In the break between the game, Sara and Thomas go to the roof to talk, where she tells him that she threw the game and really cares about him. Jack takes Wayne and gets him drunk in the hopes that he will repeat his performance against Caller. Daddy, not wanting the Stickmen to win, locks Thomas and Sara on the roof.   Wayne steps up to the break of the final match against the Bankers but passes out on the table. Jack has to play, being the only one left. However, Holden rescues Thomas and Sara, and Thomas proceeds to win the game for the Stickmen. Hugh snaps his cue over his knee in anger and storms out. Daddy tells them to stop by his barber shop next week to collect the money.   A few weeks later, we see that Dave has done up his bar, which is now a successful establishment, and the film ends with the Stickmen playing a friendly game of pool in the bar.

Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation
 [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]] is still contemplating the death of his master, [[Gouken]], while at the same time experiencing trouble with the , an evil energy which Gouken's brother, [[Akuma (Street Fighter)|Akuma]], succumbed to a long time ago. While in the city, Ryu fights off a few agents working for [[Shadaloo]], gaining the attention of Interpol agent [[Chun-Li]], who does some background research and realizes Ryu is the man who beat Sagat, the Muay Thai Champion, many years ago. Also catching sight of Ryu is aspiring martial artist [[Sakura (Street Fighter)|Sakura]], who becomes fascinated with Ryu and vows to track him down and become his student.  In Japan, Ryu is approached by a mysterious woman, [[Rose (Street Fighter)|Rose]], who questions him briefly about his hold over the Dark Hadou and reason for fighting. While visiting Gouken's grave, Ryu meets his old friend, [[Ken (Street Fighter)|Ken]]. They are both approached by a young boy named Shun, who claims that he is Ryu's long-lost brother. According to Shun, their mother raised Shun in Brazil until her recent death, and she sent Shun to find Ryu before she died. Ken is skeptical, but Ryu decides to take Shun in and notices the boy's potential as a fighter. One night Ryu succumbs to the Dark Hadou nearly killing Ken. Fortunately Ken punches him in the stomach. Ryu then returns to normal. Later that night Ken talks to Ryu about his Dark Hadou. Ryu instructs Ken to kill him if he's ever completely possessed by the Dark Hadou. Ken is reluctant at first, but then agrees.  Ken and Shun decide to enter an underground fighting tournament, but Ryu declines. On the way, they are harassed by some street thugs. Ryu and Shun fight them off effortlessly, but Ryu also notices a rather violent and sadistic streak in Shun, whom he has to punch to stop him killing one of the thugs. Ken, meanwhile, finds Sakura in a bar and agrees to take her to Ryu, although he is too late to enter the tournament, much to his chagrin. Inside the building, Ryu is found by Chun-Li, who managed to locate him. In the tournament, watched by its enigmatic organiser, Dr. Sadler, Shun is pitted against the brutal wrestler, [[Zangief]]. Shun briefly manages to pummel Zangief with his superior speed, but the Dark Hadou catches up with Shun, distracting him long enough to receive a brutal beating from Zangief. Ryu steps in and briefly fights Zangief, but he too is overcome by the Dark Hadou and he almost kills Zangief with a Dark Hadouken, which misses Zangief but causes the building to start collapsing. As Ken takes an injured Sakura to safety, Ryu is confronted by a huge man, Rosanov, who proves to be more than a match for both Ryu and Chun-Li combined. Just as Rosanov prepares to knock Ryu unconscious, Shun steps in and takes the blast. Ryu succumbs to his rage and obliterates Rosanov with a Shinku Hadouken. However, while Ryu is distracted, Shun is abducted by Shadaloo agents.  By now, Ryu has completely lost the will to fight. However, Rose appears before him once again, compelling him to save Shun from Sadler and himself. Ryu accepts, but first goes to see Akuma, accompanied by Chun-Li, in his secluded home in the mountains. Once there, Akuma, under the belief that Ryu has come to challenge him at last, attempts to goad him into succumbing to the Dark Hadou, but Ryu refuses, and Akuma orders him to leave. Ryu manages to ask Akuma if he is Shun's father, but Akuma denies it. Ken arrives and spars with Ryu. After they spar Ryu reminds Ken to kill him if he's taken over by the Dark Hadou. After this, Ryu decides to travel to Sadler's hideout and rescue Shun himself, accompanied by Ken, Chun-Li, Guy, Dan, Dhalsim, Birdie, Adon, Rolento and Sodom.  As the other fighters battle outside Sadler's lab in the arena, Ryu, Ken and Chun-Li sneak inside to find Shun. The first winner is Birdie, and he is led into a trap which will strip him of his fighting potential, though he is freed by Ken and Chun-Li, who break the other fighters out. However, they are confronted by a very alive Rosanov in the corridor, who makes quick work of the three of them despite their efforts, blowing that part of the hideout to smithereens. Ryu arrives on the scene and fights Rosanov again, realizing that Rosanov is actually an android, and this one is really Shun, who was working for Sadler and luring Ryu into a trap. Shun/Rosanov attempts to goad Ryu into using the Dark Hadou, since he is connected to Sadler and every blow which is landed on Shun/Rosanov will increase Sadler's fighting potential and make him stronger. Ryu refuses, but is eventually pushed over the edge when Shun/Rosanov beats Ken mercilessly and Ken uses the last of his strength for a Shoryuken which does nothing more than dislocate the android's jaw. Finally, Ryu succumbs and fires a Dark Hadouken at the android, freeing Shun and destroying Rosanov once and for all.  With this sudden increase in power, Sadler bursts out of his lab and finally emerges on the battlefield. With Ryu exhausted, Sadler easily takes the upper hand and pummels Ryu around. Ryu prepares to succumb to the Dark Hadou once again, even though Ken and Shun implore him not to. Sadler overwhelms Ryu with a Hadouken, which nearly kills him. Though only Ryu can see her, Rose intervenes, informing Ryu that "''you haven't drawn the death card yet''". Inspired, Ryu snaps out of the vision and returns to his normal state and fires a normal, Shinku Hadouken directly into a distracted Sadler, who crumbles into dust while openly wondering how Ryu could still surpass him. Shun's injuries, however, are too severe, and as he lies dying, he reveals that he lied to Ryu about being his brother and worked with Sadler so as to raise money for his mother, who still died. Ryu then tells Shun that he is still his brother. As Shun succumbs, Ryu vows never to use the Dark Hadou ever again.  The movie's final scenes depict the fighters returning to their everyday lives. Sakura, now fully recovered, decides to continue training so that one day she may be able to fight Ryu. Chun Li is seen beating some other thugs, and Ken is seen fighting in another street fighter tournament. In a distant area near the sea. Ryu is seen accepting Akuma's challenge, but informs him that he will not use the Dark Hadou. The two then jump into the air with their battle cries ready to fight.  
Subconscious Cruelty
  The film is based on several nihilistic and metaphorical stories about life, death and everything between.  
Stranger With A Camera
 ''Stranger with a Camera'' explores the conditions that fueled the murder of Canadian filmmaker Hugh O’Connor as well as the implications his death has for filmmakers.  The film begins by chronicling the details of the incident. In 1967, O’Connor and his crew were working on a film called ''US'' that sought to depict the variety of people across the United States. While in eastern Kentucky, they filmed coal miners and their families. One afternoon, they stopped on the side of the road to film a family living in a rental house in Jeremiah, Kentucky. Although the filmmakers received permission of the family to film, the  failed to receive it from the landowner, Hobart Ison. As the filmmakers were leaving, Ison drove up and fired three shots, killing Hugh O’Connor.  The killing of Hugh O’Connor by Hobart Ison had a lasting impact on the surrounding community, including the filmmaker herself. Elizabeth Barret grew up in Letcher County. She explains that while she grew up knowing what had happened the day of O’Connor’s death, she now desires to find out why it happened. She wonders, what brought these two men, one with a camera and one with a gun, face to face back in 1967?  She poses several questions in the beginning of the film. What is the difference between how people see their own place and how others represent it? Who does get to tell the community’s story? What are the storytellers’ responsibilities? And, what do these questions have to do with the murder of Hugh O’Connor?  Barret sets out on her journey to understand both sides of the story surrounding the death of Hugh O’Connor. She delves into background of both Ison and O’Connor through interviews of their respective friends and family. Through the film she explores the impact of the images generated by mass media of rural Appalachia during the War on Poverty: images of coal mining disasters, coal strikes, and poor people. As a native of Letcher County she can understand Hobart Ison’s fear of outsiders portraying his home in a negative way. As a filmmaker, she can understand the goal of the Hugh O’Connor to capture the story on film.  Hobart Ison’s trial for murder in 1968 resulted in a hung jury, 11 to 1 for conviction. Ison, then, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter as the second trial was set to begin. He was sentenced to ten years in prison and was paroled after one year.  With this result, Elizabeth Barret concludes, “the ties that bind communities together are not always positive. Suspicion of those who are different - defining yourself in opposition to others - these can tie a community together, but can also lead to violence.” Although Barret admits to having found no resolution to her questions about what happened that day in 1967, she understands that as a filmmaker she has a responsibility to see her community for what it is and to tell the story no matter how difficult.  She ends, posing the question, “What are the responsibilities of any of us who take the images of other people and put them to our own uses?”<ref>http://archive.itvs.org/strangerwithacamera/story.html</ref>

Supernova (2000 film)
 ''Supernova'' chronicles the [[search and rescue|search-and-rescue]] patrol of a medical ship in deep space in the early 22nd century and its six-member crew, which includes captain and pilot A.J. Marley ([[Robert Forster]]), co-pilot Nick Vanzant ([[James Spader]]), medical officer Kaela Evers ([[Angela Bassett]]), medical technician Yerzy Penalosa ([[Lou Diamond Phillips]]), search and rescue paramedic Danika Lund ([[Robin Tunney]]) and computer technician Benjamin Sotomejor ([[Wilson Cruz]]). Aboard their vessel, the ''Nightingale 229,'' they receive an emergency distress signal coming from an ice mining operation on the moon Titan 37, more than 3,000 light-years away.  The crew answers the call and dimension-jumps &mdash; during which Captain Marley suffers fatal injuries due to a malfunction of the ship's equipment &mdash; arriving in the path of Titan 37's debris cloud, some of which damages the ship and causes the loss of 82 percent of its maneuvering fuel. Worse still, Titan 37 orbits a [[blue giant]], and its high gravity field will pull the ship to the point where it will be incinerated in 17 hours, 12 minutes &mdash; which happens to be almost the same amount of time that the Nightingale 229 will need to recharge its jump drive, their only possible hope for escape. With only an 11-minute window for escape, the surviving crew soon find themselves in danger from the disturbing young man ([[Peter Facinelli]]) they rescue, and the mysterious alien artifact he has smuggled aboard. This artifact is analyzed by the ship's computer and is said to contain nine-dimensional matter.  It is ultimately discovered that the young man who called for rescue is actually Karl Larson, an old former lover of Kaela (it is implied they had an abusive relationship). Karl came into contact with the nine-dimensional matter after recovering the artifact. It somehow enabled him to acquire super-strength and supernatural healing abilities, and made him younger (such that Kaela did not recognize him). Karl murders most of the crew except Kaela and strands Nick on the mining platform. Karl unsuccessfully attempts to romantically reconcile with Kaela. Nick finds his way back to the medical ship through a rescue pod left on the mining platform, and a battle ensues between Nick and Karl. Karl is ultimately killed by Kaela using explosives placed near the alien artifact which Karl was obsessed with retrieving. The explosion ejects the artifact into space, hurtling it towards the blue giant.  With moments left before the dimension jump activates, Kaela and Nick place themselves into the only remaining dimensional stabilization chamber (Karl had destroyed all but one), which is the only thing that enables human beings to survive the ship's dimensional jump drive. The pods are meant to hold only one person; however, two subjects might be genetically mixed during the dimensional jump. Before Nick and Kaela enter the only remaining pod, the computer warns them that the nine-dimensional matter is reacting with the gravity of the blue giant sun and will cause a nine-dimensional reaction that will spread in all directions, such that the reaction's resulting [[supernova]] will reach Earth within 51 years. The computer hypothesizes that the reaction will either destroy life on Earth or "enable humankind to achieve a new level of existence". Just before the blue giant supernovas, the ship engages in a dimensional jump which brings Nick and Kaela back to Earth. As a result of their being in the same pod, the two of them each have one eye of the other person's original eye color. The ship's computer also reveals that Kaela is pregnant, which may be the result of them being in the pod together during the jump, or the result of their copulation hours earlier.

Trapped, with no money or means of transportation, she is raped and beaten by a group of men invited by Gary. In the midst of her trauma, her mind turns back to the day in her childhood when her Uncle Andy had taken Leila's mother Bonnie out on a roadtrip and killed Bonnie in a fit of jealousy, right in front of the child Leila. It is thus revealed that Leila 'is' the little girl to whom she had been talking throughout the film. The little girl's broken home life holds the key to Leila's grown-up sexuality.  After Leila is raped, one of the men takes pity on her and helps her to escape Gary's cabin. Gary and the men form a search party and comb the woods to find her. The little girl, Leila's child self, appears to Leila to inform her that Gary intends to kill her and that she must fight for her survival. When Gary finds Leila, he is distracted by the distant screaming of the little girl that he can't see, and Leila takes the opportunity to run off and flee to safety in the arms of her friend and co-worker Millie, who had been searching the woods for her, as well.

As the film's narrator, the videographer is nevertheless never seen aside from his hands, as the camera serves as his first-person perspective for the audience. He starts by telling the story of a romance between himself and '''Meimei''' (Zhou Xun), a performer at a dive bar in Shanghai. He discusses his love of Meimei, who makes a living putting on a blond wig and mermaid costume and swimming in a large water tank at the "Happy Tavern," and who disappears days at a time, leaving him heartbroken each time.  The videographer then begins relating the story of '''Mardar''' ([[Jia Hongsheng]]), a small-time crook and motorcycle courier, and '''Moudan''' ([[Zhou Xun]]), the daughter of a rich businessman, whom Mardar is hired to ferry around town whenever Moudan's father brings home one of his mistresses. During their brief encounters on his motorcycle, Mardar and Moudan fall in love. Unbeknownst to Moudan, however, Mardar has become involved in a kidnapping scheme with his former lover Xiao Ho ([[Nai An]]), and the criminal Lao B ([[Yao Anlian]]). Mardar is ordered by Xiao-Ho  and Lao B  to take Moudan to an abandoned warehouse while they orchestrate a pickup of the ransom money.

Mardar chases after her only to see her jump into the [[Suzhou Creek|Suzhou River]], apparently to her death. Mardar is then arrested and imprisoned. Moudan's body, however, is never found.  Years later, Mardar returns to Shanghai and resumes his work as a courier, all the while still looking for Moudan. One night, he happens upon the Happy Tavern where he meets Meimei, the videographer's elusive girlfriend. Mardar, convinced she's his lost love, first spies on her in her dressing room and then seeks out the videographer to tell his story. Later, Mardar tells Meimei herself about his affair with Moudan. Humoring him at first, she eventually becomes enamored with his story and takes him to bed. After being beaten one night by the owner of the Happy Tavern, Mardar heads out to the suburbs, where he discovers the real Moudan working in a convenience store.

While there, he sees Clara, who is an actress. Meanwhile, we learn from Franck and Bruno's conversation that the former was a police officer. After working tirelessly with his partner towards bringing down a seemingly untouchable criminal, their investigation was abruptly ended.

The barmaid, Manie (Jaoui), remembers having had sex with Bruno, but Bruno regrets that he does not remember her.  ''Bérénice'' over, Clara goes to the bar with her friends, including Antoine and Valerie, and their conversation reveals that she is afraid of never working again; after all, she is forty years old.

Franck meets Manie through Bruno and they start a relationship.  Previously uninterested in theater and reluctant about seeing a play rather than having dinner in a restaurant, Castella attends another of Clara's performance and develops a fascination with her bohemian lifestyle. He joins her and her friends for lunch and attends an art show where he buys a piece. However, his cultural ignorance and general roughness makes him a laughingstock. At the bar with Clara's friends, they joke with him that [[Henrik Ibsen]] is a great comic playwright, as well as other dramatists like [[Tennessee Williams]]. Clara confides to her friend Manie that Castella is thick.  Castella's English is poor at first, but he soon makes progress. He and Clara move the classes from his office to an English tea room, and to mark his progress, he writes an awkward poem dedicated to Clara; however, he is dismayed when she says that she does not share the feelings expressed in his poem. One day she waits at the tea room and he doesn't show up. Throughout the film, Bruno practices his flute, which he plays in a band. Later, he gently complains to Manie that he hasn't received news from his girlfriend who has gone to the US for an internship. Finally, the girlfriend tells him that she has, like him, slept with someone else, and also wants to stay in the States. Manie has now developed an intense affair with Franck, to the point that they speak of marriage—jokingly, they say. However, Franck reveals himself to be more and more angry and bothered regarding Manie's drug dealing, which proves to finally end their relationship.  Castella and Angelique are drifting apart, which is made clear when she moves the painting he bought from Clara's friend, she doesn't like it and that it doesn't go with rest of the house. He retorts that he can't stand living in a candy store, referring to Angelique's interior decorating. Clara starts to feel that her friends are taking advantage of Castella and tells him. He tells her that he bought the painting and is working with her friend to redesign the front of his factory not for her but because he truly likes those things. Franck's contract is finished, and Bruno reveals that the corrupt politician he had tried to send to prison was finally caught by his former partner. Bruno says that he thinks the partner was right to stay on the force after all. This leads Franck to drive to Manie's apartment for a reconciliation. From her window, she sees him reach the door to the lobby, but he hesitates and finally drives away. Clara lands the lead part in ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' and invites Castella to the opening.

The Testaments of One Fold and One Shepherd
 In ancient America, Helam witnesses the star heralding the birth of Christ, and 33 years later he faithfully awaits the promised coming of the Messiah despite persecution for this belief. Helam's son, Jacob, is interested more in the ways of the world, including the lovely Laneah, and when his abilities as an artisan bring an offer to work for the wealthy and powerful Kohor, he jumps at the chance and is estranged from his father's house.  Kohor is plotting to destabilize the existing government and become the absolute ruler.  In contrast, Amaron, a holy man, preaches to people of Christ, whose ministry and miracles are concurrently taking place across the seas in The Holy Land. As Jacob becomes more immersed in the secular life of Kohor's house, Laneah becomes more interested in the humble faith he is forsaking. Her conversion to Christ, and the death of Amaron at the hand of Kohor's men, brings Jacob to his senses, but he knows of Kohor's plans and is imprisoned when he refuses to join the conspiracy. In Jerusalem, Jesus is crucified and the far away city of Zarahemla is plunged into darkness and destruction as Helam pushes through the crowds and ruins to help his son. All seems hopeless when he is blinded and thinks that he will not see the Messiah. However, the Messiah restores his sight when he comes to minister to the people of the Americas.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258247/plotsummary</ref>

Tears of the Black Tiger
  An elegant young woman carries a suitcase through the rain to wait in an ornate [[gazebo]] on a [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] swamp. She gazes at a photo of the man for whom she waits.  The young man, whose name is Dum, is with another gunman named Mahesuan, who defies Yoi, an enemy of their boss Fai, to come out of a house. Dressed all in [[Black#Usage, symbolism, colloquial expressions|black]] and wearing a [[cowboy hat]], Dum charges through a hail of bullets into the house and out-shoots eight of Yoi's men. Dum fires his revolver, and the bullet [[ricochet]]s around the room before drilling into a man's forehead. A red title card then flashes up and says: "Did you catch that? If not, we'll play it again!" And the shot is replayed in slow motion, showing the bullet bouncing off items in a [[Rube Goldberg]] fashion.  Dum and Mahesuan finish off Yoi, and then Dum rushes away on his own, galloping his white horse across open country. However, by the time Dum reaches the gazebo, the woman, Rumpoey Rajasena, has returned home. The next day she is formally [[engagement|engaged]] to the ambitious young Police Captain Kumjorn as [[arranged marriage|arranged]] by her father, the governor of [[Suphanburi Province]].  Mahesuan is bitter about his status as second fiddle to Dum. Until Dum came along, Mahesuan was the top gunman in the outlaw gang headed by the ruthless Fai. Mahesuan goes looking for Dum and finds him playing a [[harmonica]]. Mahesuan mocks the Black Tiger's sentimentality and challenges him to a [[duelling|gunfight]]. The quick-drawing Dum fires first, yet Mahesuan is uninjured. A decapitated snake drops from an overhanging tree branch onto Mahesuan's cowboy hat. Dum targeted the venomous snake, saving Mahesuan's life.  Retrieving his harmonica, Dum thinks back to his childhood 10 years earlier during the Second World War, when Rumpoey and her father left the city to stay on Dum's father's farm in rural [[Thailand]].  Rumpoey smashes a bamboo flute that Dum is playing and demands that he take her on a boat ride in the lotus swamp. The rich city girl says that she will take Dum to visit Bang Pu beach, if he will do all she commands. They visit the gazebo, or ''sala'' in [[Thai language]], called "Sala Awaiting the Maiden." Dum says a woodcutter built it to await a wealthy family's daughter with whom he had fallen in love. However, the maiden was prevented from meeting the woodcutter, so she [[suicide|hanged]] herself. Rumpoey weeps over this tragedy.  On the way home, they bump a boat carrying Koh and two other boys, who taunt Rumpoey. Dum defends Rumpoey, and Koh cuts Dum's forehead with a paddle, and his toadies overturn Dum's boat. Dum rescues Rumpoey but is late in bringing her home. So his father, commanding, "Never again!" severely beats the boy's back with a rattan cane. Rumpoey, feeling sorry for getting Dum into trouble, gives him a harmonica to replace the flute she smashed.  Closer to "present" time, Captain Kumjorn tells the governor of his plan to attack the bandit Fai and bring law and order to the [[American Old West|wild west]] of [[Suphanburi Province]]. Taking leave of his rather cold fiancée, Captain Kumjorn takes a small, framed portrait of Rumpoey, warmly promising to guard her photo with his life.  At an ancient [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple, Mahesuan and Dum swear a [[blood oath (ritual)|blood oath]] in front of the [[Buddharupa|Buddha statue]]. Mahesuan swears loyalty to Dum, "If I break this oath, may his gun take my life."  A betrayer guides Kumjorn's police forces to Fai's hide-out, and the outlaws run out of ammunition. The police are charging in to mop up, when Dum and Mahesuan arrive on a cliff overlooking the battle. The pair break out [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s and wipe out the police.  Fai imprisons Kumjorn in a cabin and orders Dum to execute him. Kumjorn pleads with Dum to tell his [[engagement|fiancée]] of his fate and hands Dum the framed photo of his beloved. Dum is stunned to see the portrait of Rumpoey. Mahesuan enters to find Kumjorn gone and Dum with a knife in his chest.  As Dum's wound is being treated, he thinks back to one year earlier, when he was a university student in [[Bangkok]], where he became re-acquainted with Rumpoey. Dum pleads with her to leave him alone, reasoning that she is too beautiful and [[social class|high born]] for a serious relationship with him. Later, Rumpoey is attacked by Koh and two toadies. Dum appears on the path and routs Rumpoey's attackers, for which he is [[expulsion (academia)|expelled]]. Rumpoey finds Dum walking and insists on giving him a ride in her car. She orders her driver to take them to Bang Pu beach. Dum and Rumpoey confide their love for each other and are engaged, agreeing to meet a year later at Sala Awaiting the Maiden.  Arriving home in Suphanburi, however, Dum finds his family murdered. With his dying breath, Dum's father blames Kong, and Dum swears vengeance. Dum shoots Kong and several of his clan with his father's lever-action carbine, but is chased into the forest. With one cartridge left, Dum turns the gun on himself, but is stopped by Fai, who has ridden up with his horsemen. Fai recognizes the rifle, saying he had given it to Dum's father years before. Fai hands Dum a loaded revolver and tells him to execute the men who murdered his father. Dum is now an outlaw.  Shifting to the night before Rumpoey's wedding to Kumjorn, the frustrated woman tries to [[Suicide by hanging|hang]] herself but is stopped by her nanny.  Fai, meanwhile, plans to attack the governor's mansion on the wedding night. Dum warns of the multitude of police who will be attending the Captain's nuptials, but Fai declares a love of danger.  On their way to attack the governor's mansion, Mahesuan tricks and disarms Dum, whom he accuses of intentionally freeing Kumjorn. A co-conspirator congratulates Mahesuan on robbing the Tiger of his teeth.  Dum, dressed in a [[White#Usage, symbolism, colloquial expressions|white]] suit, appears at the wedding, wishes groom and bride a happy life, and warns Kumjorn of Fai's plan to attack. Kumjorn, however, tries to shoot the man he knows as the "Black Tiger", who is his rival for Rumpoey's affection.  Just ahead of the outlaw gang's assault, Mahesuan sneaks into the mansion, where he finds Rumpoey and knocks her unconscious.  Fai's attack kills many police officers. Fai enters the mansion, but the governor drives a bayonet through his chest and then shoots him dead.  Mahesuan is carrying Rumpoey across the lawn, when he meets Dum, who demands a rematch gunfight. The men fire simultaneously. Mahesuan's bullet is deflected harmlessly, but Dum's fated bullet rips through Mahesuan's teeth. Dum drops his weapon and tends to Rumpoey.  Kumjorn confronts Dum at gunpoint. Dum reaches into his breast pocket, and Kumjorn shoots Dum—right through the framed portrait of Rumpoey for which he had been reaching. As Dum lies dying in the rain with Rumpoey sobbing over him, some of Dum's words from earlier are narrated again – that [[Four Noble Truths|life is suffering]] and a chasing after brief moments of hope.

Tenussian Vaccuvasco
  Tenussian Vaccuvasco (the word does not have any meaning except perhaps a state of chaos, and is just another word play by Shokof) was made in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] in 2000. It was produced by [[Taies Farzan]], and was shot in 3 days with digital cameras and had a cast of over 100 people who had to undergo amazing physical burdens for the film.  Each window in the building shows the life of a crowd and or residents in the apartment in the building block. Residents differ from Boxers to drug dealers to lovers and or a Maniac couple slapping each other in the face for fun. Their funny ritual of slapping each other in the face ends in a bloody finale. as the film continues the stories begin to become more intertwined, and complicated.Finally they start to directly relate to one another, and begin to even collide and connect. The hilarious situations peak as people start going into other people's apartments through the open windows in the building block. The party people enter the room of the drug dealer and steal the drugs that actually belongs to bad group of organized crime people who are after the dealer anyway, and will later find him to clear their accounts. many different situations and absurd dramaturgy of each scene in each apartment keeps the tenants busy and engaged with humorous results.  Soon more twists and troubles prevail alongside much fun and comedy moments that give the whole film a layer of lightheartedness. Shokof explained that some of the actors had to run up and down the stairs in order to be ready to act in the next scene and in a different apartment more than 5 times in a single hour to keep the continuity of the scenes intact as they had to shoot without a "cut". The Boxers had to box for over half an hour in their room on the fourth floor before the crane and camera could have reached them after covering other stories from the first floor up and "uncut". the boxers had to remain boxing for almost an hour to keep the film in continuity when the camera finally reached their scene on the fourth floor.  The music contributions by Legendary [[Ravi Shankar]] and [[Mikis Theodorakis]], [[Dissidenten]], [[Geheimbund]], and [[Taies Farzan]] make the whole film a popular one for regular movie viewers even though the film remains an experimental effort to the end.  
Tender Age
   
Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her
 ''Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her'' consists of five stories or vignettes, tied together loosely to envision the complexity of incomplete communications about life, family, and love. We glimpse the lives of five women, each facing problems such as loneliness, dissatisfaction, longing, and or desire. [[Rodrigo García (director)|Rodrigo García]], in his first time directing, assembled this film with a loaded cast of actresses who can tell you everything you need to know just by their body language and facial expressions. Their individual stories show us what "things you can tell just by looking at her".  In the film's prologue, Kathy ([[Amy Brenneman]])—a police detective—and her partner are investigating the apparent suicide of an unknown woman. Dr. Keener ([[Glenn Close]]), a middle-aged doctor, attempts to care for her aging mother while coping with her own loneliness. She avoids intimacy, but also longs for it; we see both frustration and anticipation as she waits for phone calls from male colleagues. Dr. Keener decides to seek comfort or escape in Christine ([[Calista Flockhart]]) who reads tarot cards. Christine’s partner Lilly ([[Valeria Golino]]) is critically ill with an unnamed disease, possibly cancer.  Rebecca ([[Holly Hunter]]) is a successful bank manager who's "not big on regrets". After a three-year involvement with Robert ([[Gregory Hines]])—who keeps her secret from his wife—she becomes pregnant. Before Rebecca visits Dr. Keener to get an abortion, she has a fling with Walter, ([[Matt Craven]]), a subordinate.  Rose ([[Kathy Baker]]) is a single mother who is writing children’s books. She develops a sweet crush on a new dwarf neighbor ([[Danny Woodburn]]), who catches Rose spying on him. Rose later experiences the shock of learning about her son's extensive sexual activity.  Kathy's sister, Carol Faber ([[Cameron Diaz]]), is a lovely blind woman who has an active social life. Kathy is attracted to the medical examiner in the suicide case, and her story ends with him taking her out on a date. In an epilogue, Dr. Keener drops in to a bar, where she meets the male character, Walter, from previous stories (possibly the younger male alluded to in Christine's tarot card reading).  Carmen, a woman who appears in five scenes in the five different stories, the first is walking past Dr. Keener's house, another is walking beside Rebecca, a third time is in the grocery store while Rose is shopping, the fourth time is walking past Christine's apartment building at night as Christine looks down from her balcony, and the final time is the [[Autopsy|post mortem]] examination by detective Kathy alongside Dr Sam ([[Miguel Sandoval]]). Carol's imaginative story towards the end of the film helps explain the instances throughout the movie where she appears. According to Carol, she was back in town to reconnect with her ex, whom she had been talking to for months until her move back to Los Angeles. In each scene, she is, as Carol deduces, preparing for the big date with her ex. In the first scene she is in, she is probably looking for a place to rent; the second, she is seen carrying her ill-fated red dress; the third she is shopping for toiletries; the fourth she is seen walking back to her place, in which she looks visibly heartbroken, and final scene, in the coroners lab, echoes the beginning of the film, where she is found dead. Carol's story ends with what Kathy already concluded, she committed suicide over a love she, as Carol claims, could not revive, like the baby she had lost many years before.  
There's Only One Jimmy Grimble
 Jimmy Grimble ([[Lewis McKenzie (actor)|Lewis McKenzie]]) is a 15-year-old misfit living in [[Manchester]], where nothing seems to go his way. Jimmy is constantly threatened by the school bully, "Gorgeous" Gordon ([[Bobby Power]]); he is also not sure what to make of Johnny ([[Ben Miller]]), a lost-in-the-ozone biker who is dating Donna ([[Gina McKee]]), Jimmy's mum; and he has a crush on one of his classmates, Sara ([[Samia Ghadie]]), who seems to like him, but his powers of speech invariably fail him when he tries to talk to her. Like most [[Natives of Manchester|Mancunians]], Jimmy loves football. He is a fervent supporter of [[Manchester City]] and attends home games with Donna's ex-boyfriend, Harry ([[Ray Winstone]]). Jimmy also loves to play football, but while Eric ([[Robert Carlyle]]), the coach of his school's team, thinks he has potential, "Gorgeous" is already a skilled player, and when Gordon's father informs the school he will make a large and much-needed donation if their team makes it to the Manchester Schools Cup final, it looks like Jimmy will be on the bench for a while. But when an old woman gives Jimmy a pair of boots that once belonged to one of City's greatest players, his skills on the field begin to change.  
Thenali
 Thenali Soman ([[Kamal Haasan|Kamal Hassan]]) is a [[Sri Lankan Tamils|Sri Lankan Tamil]] who has come to [[Chennai]] for psychiatric treatment because of numerous phobias caused by his trauma of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. Dr. Panchabhootham ([[Delhi Ganesh]]) and his assistant ([[Ramesh Khanna]]), who are the doctors treating Thenali, are jealous of a relatively junior doctor Kailash ([[Jayaram]]) getting all the media attention. They send Thenali over to him, believing that his failure to cure Thenali of his phobias will derail his success. Soon after their first appointment, Kailash heads to his home in [[Kodaikanal]] on a vacation with his wife Jalaja ([[Devayani]]) and his two children Arjun (Master Suraj) and Aishwarya (Baby Taj Nisha). Kailash tells Thenali to wait until after the vacation before his therapy can begin, but Panchabhootham asks for Thenali to go meet Kailash while on vacation.  The expected happens. Thenali falls in love with Janaki ([[Jyothika]]), Kailash's younger sister, which is vehemently opposed by the latter. The whole film is about how Kailash goes mad with Thenali's antics and even begins to suspect that his wife has an affair with Thenali, as she has a soft corner for the latter. He even tries to kill Thenali by tying him to a tree with a [[time bomb]]. Thenali, thinking it is a fake bomb used only to relieve him from his fears, removes it and puts it in Kailash's house, causing it to explode. Seeing this, Kailash suffers a paralytic attack. Thenali later marries Janaki.  While Thenali, Kailash, and family are at a picnic, Thenali's long-lost wife shows up and re-unites with him. Enraged, Kailash jumps out of his wheelchair and berates Thenali for ruining Janaki's life, but soon realises this was all a set-up by Thenali to cure Kailash's paralysis through shock treatment, which succeeded; the woman was actually actress [[Meena (actress)|Meena]], who Thenali hired to pose as his wife.  
The Thin Blue Lie
 The premise of the film concerns ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' reporter Jonathan Neumann ([[Rob Morrow]]), who, along with his partner Phil Chadway ([[Randy Quaid]]), won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1978 for a series of articles exposing Philadelphia mayor [[Frank Rizzo]] ([[Paul Sorvino]]) and the Philadelphia Police Department for corruption.  According to the articles, suspects were beaten and tortured in interrogation rooms in an effort to meet the high quota of criminal cases solved by Philadelphia detectives.  Neumann and Chadway met extreme opposition from the police department, working amidst phone tappings, apartment ransackings, and threats of death and bodily harm.

Later that day, at Tidmouth Sheds, Diesel 10 arrives and announces his plan to get rid of the steam engines; Thomas leaves to get Mr. Conductor. "The Lost Engine", named Lady, is hidden in a workshop on Muffle Mountain, as done by Burnett Stone after Diesel 10's last attempt to destroy her. Despite having rebuilt Lady, Burnett is unable to steam her despite using different types of coal.

Toby rings his bell to distract him, causing Diesel 10 to knock the shed roof. Later, Henry has a bad cold, so Thomas collects six special coal trucks for him, but because one rolled through the Magic Buffers, he only has five according to Bertie.  The next day, Lily meets Patch, who takes her on a horse ride to Shining Time, where she meets Junior again. Junior takes her through the Magic Railroad to Sodor, where they meet Thomas.

Meanwhile, Diesel 10 takes Junior to the scrapyards where James was there. Junior tries to whistle both of them out, only to discover that he, too, is out of gold dust. Diesel 10 tries to force the two into a melting pit, but Junior uses the last of his extra gold dust to teleport himself and James away. The two arrive near the buffers, where Mr. Conductor is there waiting. Mr. Conductor and Junior, both out of gold dust, refuse to give up hope.  Lily finds Burnett in his workshop where he shows her Lady and explains his problem in getting her to steam.

Junior decides to go to work on Sodor and Mr. Conductor gives him his own cap before sending him to another railway, before leaving himself to welcome Sir Topham Hatt home. Lily, Burnett, Patch and Mutt return to Shining Time, while Thomas happily travels home into the sunset.  
Thirteen Days (film)
 In October 1962, [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] aerial surveillance photos reveal that the Soviet Union is in the process of placing intermediate-range ballistic missiles carrying nuclear weapons in [[Cuba]]. President [[John F. Kennedy]] ([[Bruce Greenwood]]) and his advisers must come up with a plan of action to prevent their activation. Kennedy is determined to show that the United States will not allow a missile threat. The [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] advise immediate U.S. military strikes against the missile sites followed by an invasion of Cuba. However, Kennedy is reluctant to attack and invade because it would very likely cause the Soviets to invade Berlin, which could lead to an all-out war. Citing ''[[The Guns of August]]'', Kennedy sees an analogy to the events that started [[World War I]], where the tactics of both sides' commanders had not evolved since the [[Franco-Prussian War|previous war]] and were obsolete, only this time nuclear weapons are involved. War appears to be almost inevitable.  The Kennedy administration tries to find a solution that will remove the missiles but avoid an act of war. They settle on a step less than a blockade, which is formally regarded as an act of war. They settle on what they publicly describe as a [[blockade|quarantine]]. They announce that the U.S. naval forces will stop all ships entering Cuban waters and inspect them to verify they are not carrying weapons destined for Cuba. The Soviet Union sends mixed messages in response. Off the shores of Cuba, the Soviet ships turn back from the quarantine lines. [[Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]] (Henry Strozier) says, "We're eyeball to eyeball and I think the other fellow just blinked." The administration continues to order spy plane pictures, but one of Kennedy's advisers, [[Kenneth O'Donnell|Kenny O'Donnell]] ([[Kevin Costner]]), calls the pilots to ensure the pilots do not report that they were shot at or fired upon, because if they were, the country would be forced to retaliate under the [[rules of engagement]].  [[John A. Scali]], a reporter with [[ABC News]], is contacted by Soviet "emissary" [[Alexander Feklisov|Aleksandr Fomin]] (Boris Lee Krutonog), and through this back-channel communication method the Soviets offer to remove the missiles in exchange for public assurances from the U.S. that it will never invade Cuba. A long message in the same tone as the informal communication from Fomin, apparently written personally by Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], is received. This is followed by a second, more hard line cable in which the Soviets offer a deal involving U.S removal of its [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter]] missiles from Turkey. The Kennedy administration interprets the second as a response from the [[Politburo]], and in a risky act, decides to ignore it and respond to the first message, assumed to be from Khrushchev. There are several mis-steps during the crisis: the defense readiness level of [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) is raised to [[DEFCON|DEFCON 2]] (one step shy of maximum readiness for imminent war), without informing the President; a nuclear weapon test proceeds ([[Operation Fishbowl#Bluegill Triple Prime|Bluegill Triple Prime]]) and a routine test launch of a U.S. offensive missile is also carried out without the President's knowledge.  In a bid for time while under intense pressure from the military for an immediate strike, President Kennedy authorizes attacks on the missile sites and an invasion of Cuba, to commence the following Monday. An Air Force U-2 reconnaissance plane is sent over Cuba to gather intelligence for the attack, but is shot down, [[Rudolf Anderson|killing the pilot]]. After much deliberation with the [[EXCOMM|Executive Committee of the National Security Council]], Kennedy makes a final attempt to avoid a war by sending his brother, [[Robert F. Kennedy]] ([[Steven Culp]]), to meet with Soviet ambassador [[Anatoly Dobrynin]] on Friday night. Bobby reiterates the demand that the Soviets remove their missiles from Cuba, and in return promises not to invade or assist in the invasion of Cuba. Dobrynin insists that the U.S. must also remove all [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter]] missiles from Turkey, on the border of the Soviet Union. Bobby says that a [[quid pro quo]] is not possible, but in exchange for Khrushchev removing all the missiles from Cuba, there will be a secret understanding that the U.S. will remove all of its "obsolete" missiles from Turkey within six months as part of a pre-scheduled plan. The Soviets announce on Sunday that they will remove their missiles from Cuba, averting a war that could have escalated to the use of [[nuclear weapons]]. The film ends with President Kennedy dictating a letter of condolence to the family of the reconnaissance pilot, [[Rudolf Anderson]], who was shot down over Cuba as part of the preparations for the invasion, and the Kennedy brothers and O'Donnell outside of the Oval Office as actual audio of President Kennedy's [[American University speech|commencement speech at American University]] played in the background.  
Tigerland
 It is September 1971 and it is clear that the US is losing the [[Vietnam War]]. In the opinion of the average American soldier who came of age during the [[Peace movement]] of the 1960s, Vietnam was "lost a long time ago". Roland Bozz ([[Colin Farrell]]), a draftee who is opposed to the war, is shown to be an unruly soldier with no respect for authority; he disobeys orders and talks back to his superiors. He quickly befriends another recruit, Jim Paxton ([[Matthew Davis]]), an aspiring writer who records his experiences in a personal journal. Unlike Bozz, Paxton volunteered for the Army. Upon reaching their post, the company commanding officer Captain Saunders makes it clear that every soldier who passes through Fort Polk and Tigerland will be sent to Vietnam. He also states that any political views on the war are irrelevant at this point.  As the film progresses, another side of Bozz is shown. Having "x-ray vision for loopholes", Bozz finds ways for soldiers to get out of the army—one because he not only has children but also a handicapped wife; another soldier, Miter ([[Clifton Collins Jr.]]), who joined to prove his manhood but finds himself way over his head. At one point, another soldier approaches Bozz while on leave and asks for help getting out, saying "I was told if you don't wanna go to 'Nam, you either pray to Jesus, or go see Roland Bozz." Bozz also shows his reasoning behind being opposed to the war: his human compassion. Eventually Bozz's natural leadership and ability earns him the title of squad leader (sometimes called acting Jack). Another private, Wilson ([[Shea Whigham]]), a racial bigot and instigator, continuously demeans Miter and Bozz. Bozz is the only one that retaliates, which results in a fight between the two. Paxton helps break up the fight and also earns the hatred of Wilson.  Later, while doing live fire exercises, Wilson threatens Bozz with a pistol. Bozz tries to disarm Wilson, and the two wrestle each other to the ground, Wilson getting the upper hand and putting the gun to the back of Bozz's head and pulling the trigger. Miraculously, the gun misfires, saving Bozz's life. The Commanding Officer lets Bozz choose the punishment: have Wilson [[court-martial]]ed or "let me deal with him", strongly suggesting the latter. Despite the commanding officer strongly pressing to let him deal with it, Bozz says he wants Wilson "out of the army" because he recognizes Wilson has taken an emotional beating ever since his inability to command became obvious. Bozz leaves the office saying he wants Wilson out.  The platoon is sent to "Tigerland", a forested training area designed as the best possible replica of [[Vietnam]]. During an exercise, Bozz's squad acts as villagers in a mock Vietnamese village, with one squad member designated as a "[[Viet Cong|VC]] sympathizer". They compete with another squad charged with rooting out the sympathizer. This other squad is led by Wilson, who was not kicked out of the army after all. As the exercise ends with Bozz's squad "winning", Wilson tells Bozz he will kill him no matter what it takes. Soon thereafter, Bozz is about ready to make an escape to Mexico with the aid of some civilians he has paid. Platoon member Johnson (Russell Richardson) sees him and tells him to stop; Johnson tells him if he runs away, Wilson will go after Paxton instead of Bozz and he will be responsible for his friend's death. The scene ends with Bozz apparently climbing into the van, but the next morning as the platoon falls in, Bozz comes back, acting as if he had merely gone off to urinate.  During the last training exercise, Bozz's squad and Wilson's squad are pitted against each other on patrolling missions. As Wilson's squad prepares for an attack, he replaces his blank cartridges with [[live ammunition]] and removes his [[blank-firing adaptor]]. As Bozz's squad nears, he opens fire. Though he does not hit anyone, it is obvious he is using live ammunition, and the trainer for the exercise tries to intervene. As he does, Bozz is standing above Paxton and deliberately fires a blank round with his rifle muzzle near Paxton's face, the flash wounding Paxton's eye. The trainer aims a pistol at Wilson's head to get him to hold his weapon up and surrender, telling him he will be court-martialed.  At the end of the film, the entire platoon gets ready to head to Vietnam, except Paxton whose eye injury, though not permanent, has earned him a medical discharge. Bozz and the others board a bus, and he and Paxton exchange farewells through a window. Paxton tells Bozz he is going to write about him, but Bozz says he won't. He has stolen Paxton's journal and rips out pages as the platoon's bus drives off, leaving Paxton scrambling to recover them.  Bozz tosses the journal as the bus speeds away.  Paxton then is told that Bozz died in Vietnam but he was never listed, others say he just disappeared, but another soldier calls Paxton and says that he thinks he saw Bozz three years ago in Mexico with a beautiful woman.

This Is Not Paradise
   
The Tigger Movie
 The beginning of the story is interrupted by Tigger, who is tired of most of the stories mainly about Pooh. After arranging the title page to spell "The Tigger Movie", the story then continues.   The story begins as Tigger is searching through the Hundred Acre Wood for someone to bounce with him, but all of his friends are too busy getting ready for the upcoming winter. While he searches for a playmate, Tigger accidentally destroys Eeyore's house with a boulder. He later wrecks the complex pulley system that Rabbit has rigged up to remove the boulder (which had little success) and sends his friends flying into a pond (except for Roo, who landed in two tree branches, and Eeyore, who landed in a thistle Bush). Rabbit is very furious at Tigger for destroying his Rock Remover, and the rest of Tigger's friends openly admit that they are not quite as bouncy as he is because they are not Tiggers like him. Tigger sadly wanders off in loneliness, wishing there was somebody else like him.  Roo, who wanted to play with Tigger earlier, catches up to him and asks if Tigger has a Tigger family he could bounce with. Tigger is fascinated by the idea and the two go to visit Owl for advice on finding Tigger's family history. Owl shows them portraits of his own family and mentions the concept of family trees. Tigger accidentally knocks the portraits down (even though he was able to grab a few of them with his hands and tail) and they collapse on him. When he quickly hangs them back up, all of Owl's ancestors appear to be perched on a single tree. Tigger concludes that his family tree must be a real tree and he and Roo head off to go on a search for it.  After searching the wood without turning up any giant, Tigger-striped trees, Tigger and Roo go back to Tigger's house to search for clues to his family's whereabouts. Tigger teaches Roo the awesome "Whoop-de-Dooper-Loop-de-Looper-Alley-Ooper Bounce". They find a heart-shaped [[locket]] that Tigger hopes will contain a picture of his family, but it turns out to be empty. Roo suggests Tigger try writing a letter to his family, which Tigger does before letting the wind blow it away, hoping it would take the letter to his family.   When Tigger's letter gets no response, Roo secretly gathers Tigger's friends together to write him a letter pretending to be from his family. Everyone contributes a bit of friendly advice and they sign it "your family." Tigger is overjoyed to receive the letter, but, "reading between the lines," misinterprets it and announces that his whole family is coming to visit him tomorrow. Unfortunately, Tigger's friends do not have the heart to tell Tigger that the letter is actually from them, so they decide to disguise themselves as Tiggers by making costume replicas and attend his family reunion. Rather than helping out, Rabbit however does not join in; but he angrily berates them for goofing off and not getting ready for the approaching winter storm and he slams off in a huff. Despite this, Roo manages to persuade everyone to help cheer Tigger up.      Tigger completely falls for the Tigger disguises until Roo attempts to do Tigger’s complex Whoop-de-Dooper-Loop-de-Looper-Alley-Ooper Bounce; however, he accidentally crashes into the closet again and knocks his mask off. Tigger is struck with astonishment and berates him, he soon finds out that all of his other friends were in on it too. Frustrated thinking that his friends have betrayed him, Tigger gives a final "TTFE, Ta-ta forever!", he then goes out on his own in the ferocious snowstorm to search for his real family.  Tigger's friends form an expedition to find him and convince Rabbit to lead them into the harsh windy storm. They find Tigger sitting in a large tree with patches of snow on the trunk that resemble stripes; believing that his "family" is trying to call his name, Tigger happily jumps down. However he becomes confused when he finds that his friends had followed him instead; Rabbit tells Tigger that he needs to come home, but Tigger refuses to leave his "family tree" until his Tigger family returns. They argue and Tigger's shouting causes a huge [[avalanche]]. Tigger bounces all of his friends to safety in the tree branches, but is swept away by the snow himself. Roo successfully performs a perfect Whoop-de-Dooper-Loop-de-Looper-Alley-Ooper Bounce and rescues Tigger.  When the avalanche subsides, Kanga, Owl, and Christopher Robin find them and Tigger sadly realizes that he has lost the letter from his family. All his friends each recite their parts of the letter from memory and Tigger finally realizes that his friends are his real family the whole time. He throws a new family reunion party with presents for everyone, including a beautiful new home for Eeyore (made from the family room meant for Tigger's "family"), a large honeypot for Pooh and huge supply of firewood for Piglet, to last for the whole winter, he then makes Rabbit a promise that he'll always watch where he's bouncing. Tigger then gives Roo the heart-shaped locket and Christopher Robin takes a picture of Roo, Tigger, and the rest of their family to go in it. The film ends with the camera pan backing away from the family photo as the locket closes up.  
Time of Favor
 Manachem, a handsome young soldier in the [[Israeli Defense Force]], is offered his own unit, made up of fellow students from [[Rabbi]] Meltzer’s [[West Bank]] [[Yeshiva]]. Menachem's close friend Pini is one of the star scholars at the Yeshiva, and Rabbi Meltzer, in an attempt to play matchmaker, promises Pini his daughter Michal's hand in marriage. But Michal, strong-willed and independent, has no interest in marrying Pini, who is weak and in poor health. Instead, she falls for Menachem, and his loyalty to the Rabbi and to his friend Pini are tested as he struggles to choose between Michal and the unit.   Michal confesses to Menachem that she cannot stand living in her father's settlement. “This land of [[Israel]] is bought with pain,” says Michal, as she looks out on the sandy mountains of the West Bank. She believes that her father, the Rabbi, is too caught up in the Israeli cause and neglects those closest to him, like Michal's late mother who died of cancer after the Rabbi refused to leave the settlement to take her to the city for proper medical care. She resolves to run away, and asks Menachem to come with her. But Menachem feels guilty on account of Pini and the Rabbi, and leaves the settlement to return to his military base.  Menachem's unit had been mobilized by the Rabbi with the purpose of returning Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock to the control of Israel -- a holy shrine in the old city that Muslims use as a mosque ([[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]) and Jews call [[Temple Mount]]. Menachem agrees with Rabbi Meltzer's plan in principle, regarding the group's activities as more symbolic than anything else. Other military authorities are wary of his plan, believing the Rabbi's soldiers could easily turn into a fanatical terrorist group with the wrong twist of the political winds.   Michal leaves her father's settlement and goes to live in Jerusalem. This does not deter Pini, who continues to make advances and she rejects him over and over. Devastated by Michal's rejections, Pini becomes newly determined to make good within Rabbi Meltzer's military unit, while mapping out a terrorist plot with the help of fellow student Itamar (Micha Selektar) in which they'll finally destroy the Dome of the Rock by bombing it from below. To convince Itamar to go along with the plan, he convinces him that Manacham approves of the plan, when in reality Menacham knows nothing about it.  Pini and Itamar leave to undertake the mission, and the rest of Menacham's unit is taken in by the Israeli government for questioning. After undergoing hours of interrogation, Menacham realizes that Pini has betrayed him. Guarded heavily by Israeli Defense Soldiers, Menacham, Michal and another soldier, Mookie, follow Pini and Itamar into a secret network of underground tunnels underneath Jerusalem, where Pini is waiting to blow up the Dome of the Rock using a suicide bomber's vest. The movie comes to a sharp climax as the characters race through the tunnels, trying to reach Pini and convince him to stop before it is too late. They find Itamar's body in the tunnels - he had fallen, or was killed by Pini along the way. Finally they reach Pini, who is lying in a cave preparing to detonate the bomb. Menacham and Michal plead with him, but he refuses to change his mind. As Pini reaches for the button to detonate the bomb, Menacham leaps on top of him to try and prevent him from setting it off. But in the same instant, Mookie shoots and kills Pini. The movie ends with Menacham, Michal and the rest of the Israeli Defense Team exiting the tunnels together.   Cedar’s Zionist upbringing is apparent in this highly religious film. ''Time of Favor'' handles the [[Holy Land]] with high regard and maintains a sense of solemnity throughout. The importance of prayer and tradition is stressed. Soldiers dressed in full uniform break from their training to open prayer books and raise their minds to God. The Rabbi’s religious position marks him as a strong authority in his community. He is trusted and respected, and his students, with total faith in him, follow his every wish.  
Timecode (2000 film)
 The film takes place in and around a film production company office, and involves several interweaving plot threads which include a young actress named Rose ([[Salma Hayek]]) who tries to score a screen test from her secret boyfriend Alex Green ([[Stellan Skarsgård]]), a noted but disillusioned director. Meanwhile, Rose's tryst with him is discovered by her girlfriend Lauren ([[Jeanne Tripplehorn]]), an insanely jealous businesswoman who plants a microphone in Rose's purse and spends most of the time in the back of her limousine parked outside the office building listening in on Rose's conversations. Elsewhere, Alex's wife Emma ([[Saffron Burrows]]) is seen with a therapist ([[Glenne Headly]]) debating about asking him for a divorce. In the meantime, numerous film industry types (played by [[Xander Berkeley]], [[Golden Brooks]], [[Holly Hunter]] and [[Kyle MacLachlan]]), pitch ideas for the next big hit film.  
A Time for Drunken Horses
  An Iranian [[Kurds|Kurdish]] family is trying to survive after the death of its parents. ''Ayoub'', the eldest boy in the family, becomes the head of the household and must do whatever work available to survive. ''Madi'', Ayoub's handicapped brother, is in need of a medical operation. ''Ayoub'' goes to great lengths to collect money for the operation by smuggling truck tires with a group of Kurdish villagers near the Iran-Iraq border. Ayoub ultimately falls short of his intended goal and his uncle decides to marry off his sister in return for the groom's family financing Madi's operation on the Iraqi side of the border. When they arrive the mother of the groom refuses to accept Madi and agrees to give Ayoub and his uncle a mule as compensation. Ayoub decides to take the mule to Iraq where it is worth more, and sell it to pay for his brother's surgery. Some smugglers let him come along with him. They use mules to carry goods and feed them liquor allowing them to better survive the harsh mountain winter. But they are ambushed while heading to the border, and the horses are too drunk to carry on. Ayoub narrowly manages to escape, and the last shot is of him and his brother crossing the border.  
Timequest (film)
 ''Timequest'' explores the [[science fiction theme]] of altering the present day by [[time travel|traveling back in time]] and tampering with past events. In this particular film, on the morning of November 22, 1963, a elderly man (Ralph Waite) who wears spacesuit-type clothing materializes in the hotel suite occupied by Jackie Kennedy (Caprice Benedetti). The Time Traveler shows Jackie future television footage of the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] and [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|funeral]] of John F. Kennedy (Victor Slezak). Shortly thereafter, the Time Traveler speaks to the president and to the cynical Attorney General Bobby Kennedy (Vince Grant), giving them details of their respective assassinations (as it takes the Time Traveler quite a bit to convince Robert Kennedy that he is who he says he is as Kennedy attempts to debunk the Time Traveler's story) and of the public revelations of JFK's [[John F. Kennedy#Extramarital relationships|sex scandals]], convincing the president to remain faithful to his wife. The Time Traveler, knowing Bobby's ways, won't state his name or his birthplace, but does mention that he was born on this day. The Time Traveler asks Jackie to dance with him; she does (the Time Traveler is obsessed with Jackie Kennedy).  The Time Traveler and the three Kennedys drink a toast in the hotel suite just before 12:30 pm, which is the time that history is definitely changed (JFK is shot-JFK is not shot). At 12:30 the Time Traveler turns into nothingness, and the lead-crystal glass that he was holding drops to the floor and shatters. Bobby finds a piece of glass with the Time Traveler's fingerprint on it. Lee Harvey Oswald (Jeffery Steiger) is captured, and [[Jack Ruby]] is killed before he can shoot Oswald. [[Clint Hill (Secret Service)|Clint Hill]] and Bobby Kennedy head to the grassy knoll and Hill takes out two gunman (indicating the film producers' belief in the [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories about the assassination]]). Oswald is taken to [[Washington, D.C.]] and interrogated by the [[Warren Commission]]; as a result, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] is disbanded. When [[J. Edgar Hoover]] threatens to blackmail the President by revealing audio tapes of Kennedy having sex with [[Marilyn Monroe]], Robert Kennedy counters by threatening to release photos of Hoover's alleged homosexuality. When Hoover caves in and agrees to hand over the tapes, Robert Kennedy also demands Hoover hand in his letter of resignation.  Similar to [[Lewinsky scandal#Denial and subsequent admission|a future situation]], John and Jackie Kennedy appear on television. John reveals his infidelities and asks for forgiveness from both his wife and the nation. Jackie stands with her husband and asks the country to do the same.  Bobby Kennedy is also determined to uncover the Time Traveler's identity in order to prevent him from eventually inventing time travel, but a pregnant Jackie exacts an iron promise from Bobby that the Time Traveler would never be harmed. As it turns out, the Time Traveler is Raymond Mead (Joseph Murphy) (who is, like his alternate self, obsessed with Jackie Kennedy). At sixteen he commits a burglary, is arrested and put on a prison bus; his fingerprinting enables President Bobby Kennedy to know the Time Traveler's name. President Bobby has the teenager pulled off the bus, he talks to the kid, and he gives Mead a full pardon.  Years later in 1994, when Mead has become an artist and is now married, an elderly Jackie buys many of his paintings. In 2001, after JFK dies of old age (and Jackie is already dead), their youngest son James Robert Kennedy (Rick Gianasi) explains to Mead why the Kennedy family has been so generous to him and reveals a portrait of his older self. The film later ends with Ray's younger self dancing with Jackie in 1963 as a dream sequence and Ray as a Baby in 1964 staring at the televised footage of Jackie outside [[Parkland Hospital]] (where her Husband was originally meant to die in the old time stream) with James as a baby on his TV.  
Time and Tide (2000 film)
 Tyler ([[Nicholas Tse]]) impregnates a lesbian cop, Ah Jo (Cathy Tsui),after a drunken night.  He joins an unlicensed bodyguard service led by Uncle Ji ([[Anthony Wong Chau Sang|Anthony Wong]]), to earn money to give to Ah Jo who wants nothing to do with him.  Nearly nine months later, Tyler meets up with a butcher named Jack ([[Wu Bai]]) and his pregnant wife, Ah Hui ([[Candy Lo]]), who helps Tyler, at Ah Hui's father's birthday, prevent the father's assassination.  Tyler tries to convince Jack to start a bodyguard service with him, but Jack turns him down.  A group of South American mercenaries, known as the ''Angels'', arrive and threaten Jack, who they call Juan, and their second in command Miguel (Couto Remotigue) offers him a chance to rejoin them if he kills his own father-in-law.  Instead, Jack kills the leader of the ''Angels'' and evades Uncle Ji's bodyguards, knocking Tyler out in the process, and then steals a case full of cash from under their noses and escapes from the Angels.  Jack drops his wife off at her father's mansion, giving her a key to a train station locker and telling her to go there when their child is born.  Tyler is interrogated by the cops in connection with Jack, who accuse him of being connected to the killer because he saw him up close.  Tyler tells them nothing.  An Jo tries unsuccessfully to parole Tyler, but Uncle Ji succeeds.  Tyler thanks An Jo, and Uncle Ji locks him up in a transportation crate for a night before letting him out and getting Tyler to tell him about Jack.  Uncle Ji gives Tyler more money, which Tyler tries to give to Ah Jo; he finds out that she has just gone into the hospital to give birth.  Tyler heads off after Jack, and breaks into his apartment only to find the ''Angels'' and Jack have the place staked out.  A running gun battle ensues between Jack and the ''Angels'' as Tyler desperately tries to survive in Jack's apartment.  Tyler ends up trapped in the apartment with the gas leaking and only manages to survive the explosion by hiding in the refrigerator, on the advice of Jack.  Jack tricks the ''Angels'' into killing one of their own and distracting them long enough so he and Tyler can escape the rest.  Miguel admits defeat and tries to call a truce with Jack, but then calls it off when one of the other ''Angels'' spots Jack's wife who arrives on the scene to see her former apartment burning.  The ''Angels'' take off after An Hui, following her to the train station. Tyler steals a taxi with his fake gun, giving his wallet to the driver, who promptly takes it to the cops.  The police, still suspicious of Tyler from earlier, place him at the scene of the gun battle and explosion send a SWAT team after him to the station.  At the station, Tyler confronts An Hui with his fake gun and takes the money Jack stole from the ''Angels''.  An Hui goes into labor and one of the ''Angels'' shoots a cop, and then an innocent, while trying to shoot Tyler.  In the ensuing panic, Tyler drags An Hui off to safety and the SWAT team arrives to deal with the situation. In response to Tyler's shouts that a pregnant woman has gone into labour, the SWAT team send in a team members disguised as medics to retrieve An Hui.  The ''Angels'' open fire on them. Jack arrives on the scene just before the SWAT team - now including Miguel and other ''Angels'' disguised as team members - starts a full invasion with tear gas. In the midst of the gases, Jack, the ''Angels'', and the SWAT team hunt one another, with SWAT officers silently killed one by one by the disguised ''Angels'', who loot SWAT gear from the fallen officers, enabling them to kill even more unsuspecting officers. Tyler escapes with An Hui.  In a confrontation on railroad tracks, Jack saves the life of the SWAT team lieutenant and surrenders to him.  The remaining ''Angels'' escape through a tunnel to a stadium full of concert-goers.  Tyler has to hunker down in the tunnels as An Hui starts to give birth, and Jack convinces the SWAT Lieutenant to let him go after Miguel in the stadium.  Jack confronts Miguel in the catwalks above the concert goers and defeats him. Meanwhile, Tyler helps An Hui successfully give birth before the last of the ''Angels'' shows up. A fight ensues, and just as Tyler is about to lose, the last of the ''Angels'' gets shot repeatedly by An Hui.  Jack is given a head-start to escape the police and visits with his wife, and Tyler recovers the money before going off to the hospital to see his child.

Titan A.E.
  In 3028, humanity has mastered deep space travel, and interacted with several alien species. A human invention called "Project Titan" alarms the Drej, a pure [[energy]]-based alien species. As the Drej start to attack Earth, Professor Sam Tucker, the lead researcher for "Project Titan", sends his son, Cale, on one of the evacuation ships with his alien friend, Tek, while Tucker and other members of his team fly the ''Titan'' spacecraft into [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]]. The Drej mother ship arrives and fires a [[directed-energy weapon]] into the planet that completely destroys Earth, while debris from the explosion also destroys the [[Moon]]. The surviving humans become nomads, generally ridiculed by other alien species.  Fifteen years later, Cale works at the salvage yard in an [[asteroid belt]] called Tau 14. He is tracked down by Joseph Korso, captain of the spaceship ''Valkyrie''. Korso reveals that Tucker encoded a map to the ''Titan'' in the ring he gave for Cale. Tek tells Cale that humanity depends on finding the ''Titan''. When the Drej attack the salvage yard, Cale escapes aboard the ''Valkyrie'' with Korso and his crew: Akima, a human female pilot, along with Preed, Gune, and Stith, aliens of various species.  On the planet Sesharrim, the Gaoul interpret the map, and discover the ''Titan'' hidden in the Andali [[Nebula]]. Drej fighters arrive, capturing Cale and Akima. The Drej eventually discard Akima and extract the ''Titan''s map from Cale. Korso's crew rescues Akima, while Cale eventually escapes in a Drej ship, and rejoins the group. Cale's map has changed and now shows the ''Titan''s final location.  While resupplying at a human [[space station]] called New [[Bangkok]], Cale and Akima discover that Korso and Preed are planning to betray the ''Titan'' to the Drej. Cale and Akima manage to escape the ''Valkyrie'', but they are stranded on New Bangkok, when Korso and the rest of the crew set off for the ''Titan''. With the help of New Bangkok's colonists, Cale and Akima salvage a small spaceship named ''Phoenix'', and race to find the ''Titan'' before Korso does.  Cale and Akima navigate through the ice field in the Andali Nebula, and dock with the ''Titan'', before the ''Valkyrie'' arrives. They discover [[DNA]] samples of Earth animals, and a pre-recorded holographic message left by Tucker. Tucker explains that the ''Titan'' was designed to [[Terraforming|create an Earth-like planet]]. However, due to its escape from Earth before its destruction, its power cells lack the energy necessary for the process. The message is interrupted by the arrival of Korso and Preed. Preed reveals himself to be a mercenary for the Drej, and betrays Korso, while holding him, Cale, and Akima at gunpoint. Preed attempts to kill all three of them for the Drej, but he is killed by Korso. Moments later, the Drej attack the ''Titan''. While the remaining crew of the ''Valkyrie'' distracts them, Cale - given the fact that Drej are, essentially, beings of pure energy - modifies the ''Titan'' to absorb them, thus re-energizing the ship. Korso sacrifices his life to help Cale complete the repairs. The ''Titan'' absorbs the Drej mothership along with everyone aboard, and uses their gained power, along with the ice field, to generate a new habitable planet.  While on the newly formed planet, Cale and Akima witness the weather of the new planet as it begins to rain. Stith and Gune leave on the ''Valkyrie'', as human colony ships approach the planet to start life anew.  
Together (2000 film)
 ''Together'' is set in one of the [[Commune (intentional community)|sharehome communes]] that was created around [[Stockholm]] in the 1970s. Loosely led by the kind-natured Göran, who will do anything to avoid a conflict, the group spend their time arguing about left-wing politics and other more practical issues, such as whether doing the dishes is [[bourgeois]]. The sharehome's dynamics are significantly shaken when Göran's sister, Elisabeth, leaves her violent husband Rolf and moves in, bringing her two children Eva and Stefan.  Self-declared lesbian Anna lives in the commune with her ex-husband Lasse and their son Tet (named after the [[Tet offensive]]), who befriends Stefan. The two play games such as "torture the [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]] victim" where, in the spirit of equality, they take turns at being [[Augusto Pinochet]]. Eva meanwhile befriends a lonely boy across the street named Fredrik; his family appears conventional on the surface but proves to be even more dysfunctional than the commune of which they so openly disapprove. The children are portrayed as sidelined by everyone in the film, from the new school where they are bullied to the parents who, while genuinely loving, are too busy experimenting with their own freedom to show it.  Elisabeth's husband Rolf makes a concerted effort to clean up his act, although not before getting [[drunk]] and arrested, leaving his children stranded on a roadside after a disastrous meal in a Chinese restaurant. Further relationship problems are found with Klas, who is desperately in love with Lasse, and between Göran and his selfish and immature girlfriend, who wants the benefits of an [[open relationship]] but not the responsibilities.

He is also sat beside Amy Lawrence, a friend to whom he became "engaged". She still has romantic feelings for him but he is too transfixed by Becky to notice. Tom's pet frog Rebel then disrupts the class, meaning they are given early dismissal.  On the way home from school, during the musical number "Hook, Line and Sinker", Tom tries multiple times to steal a kiss from Becky, but is thwarted each time by her father, Judge Thatcher.  The next day, as Tom is about to go fishing with his friends, But, Then Aunt Polly was confused at tom. So she wants to decide to make him paint the house as a chore, hard work or maybe a punishment for what happened at school.  Tom, however, gets his friends to paint the house for him instead.  That night, when Tom and Huck go [[treasure hunt]]ing, they find Injurin' Joe and his friend Mutt Potter uncovering a chest of gold.  Deputy Bean, who is visiting his wife's grave, discovers Joe and Mutt. As the boys watch from behind a [[tombstone]], Joe brutally murders Bean who tried to hit him with a shovel, frames Mutt and captures Rebel. Tom knows that Joe can track him down through Rebel, so he and Huck make a pact never to tell anyone what they have seen.  The next day, at school Becky accidentally spills ink on test results.  Amy is so happy because she wants to cheat Becky, but Tom takes the blame, for which he receives a [[corporal punishment|thrashing]] with a ruler by Mr. Dobbins.  Amy were so angry because Tom saved Becky.

He then admits he did the same with Amy, causing Becky to call off the engagement.  Tom and Huck visit Mutt, who is on [[death row]].  They try to get him to remember Injurin' Joe [[murder|murdering]] Bean, but Mutt doesn't remember.  Joe meanwhile finds Tom and Huck, but they escape on a [[raft]].

Next morning, Judge Thatcher sentences Mutt to be [[hanging|hanged]], but Huck and Tom testify against Joe at the last minute.  Joe goes after Tom and Huck but fails and is pulled away by a river, while Mutt is freed and the boys are hailed as heroes.  During the celebration, after making up with Tom, Becky talks Tom into exploring a [[cave]]. Amy follows them.  Tom and Becky go into a cave and Tom says to Becky that she is the prettiest girl who he ever seen.  That made Amy very sad and she stopped to follow Tom and Becky.  They get lost and Becky begins to lose hope to finding the exit.  Tom sings a number, "Light at the End of the Tunnel" to try and reassure her that they will find a way out.  Instead of finding an exit, they find treasure and Joe.  Meanwhile, the townspeople notice Tom and Becky missing and Amy, who saw Tom and Becky go into the cave, reveals where they are. The townspeople go to look for them in the cave.  With Huck's help, Tom subdues Joe, causing a rockfall which kills Joe, and is reunited with the townspeople and Aunt Polly. In the end Amy becomes Huck's girlfriend (after being impressed with how he assisted Tom against Joe) and Becky becomes Tom's girlfriend. Amy is no more jealous of Becky. The next day, Sid again tries to snitch on Tom, but it backfires, as Aunt Polly makes Sid paint the house instead of Tom.  The movie ends with Tom, Becky, Huck and Amy having a [[picnic]], during which Tom shows the others a gold coin and tells them about another treasure hunt.

Tomie: Replay
 The film begins with a six-year-old girl being rushed into a hospital ER with an unusually distended stomach. Doctors begin to operate and find a disembodied head, Tomie's head, alive and growing inside the girl's belly. The head is placed in a tank of alkaline solution in the basement of the hospital for further observation. Soon after, all five of the hospital workers present during the operation mysteriously leave the hospital or disappear entirely, including hospital Director Morita. Meanwhile, a few nights later, Takeshi visits his friend Fumihito, who is recovering from some ailment in his hospital room. While visiting, Takeshi is confronted by a naked Tomie (Mai Hosho), now fully grown and escaped from the basement, who asks him to get her out of there. Takeshi takes Tomie to his apartment, and leaves Fumihito by himself, with no explanation. Later, Fumihito calls Takeshi to find out why he left. Takeshi reacts very defensively and irrationally, telling Fumihito that "Tomie belongs to me," already under Tomie's evil and seductive influence.  The next morning, Yumi, Director Morita's daughter, visits the hospital in search of her father, missing since the operation. She meets Dr. Tachibana, the only doctor present during the young girl's operation who hasn't yet left the hospital. Tachibana gives Yumi a journal recently written by her father, and soon after giving it to her he kills himself. Through the journal we learn that during the operation, Director Morita and another doctor were accidentally infected with Tomie's blood, and that through that blood Tomie is regenerating within the doctors, taking over their bodies and driving them mad. Yumi reads in her father's journal about him wanting to kill a girl named "Tomie".  Later, Yumi and Fumihito meet at a party and realize they are both looking for a girl named "Tomie". They join forces to find out what happened to Yumi's father, and to Fumihito's friend. The next day, Yumi visits the family of the six-year-old girl who had had the operation. She learns that prior to that operation, the girl had received a kidney transplant from a girl named "Tomie". From this kidney, Tomie had begun to regenerate inside the girl's body. Meanwhile, Fumihito visits his friend Takeshi, who had gone mad after killing and decapitating Tomie in a fit of jealousy, then watching her come back to life, regenerating a new head. Takeshi soon after is committed to a mental hospital, and Fumihito becomes Tomie's new prey. That night Yumi has a short and strange run-in with her missing father, during which he babbles about needing to kill Tomie. The following day his dead body is discovered in the hospital basement, bloated and deformed. At his funeral Yumi receives a note from Tomie, asking to meet her that night at the hospital, seemingly for a final showdown.  Yumi arrives at the hospital to find Tomie there to taunt her, and Fumihito, now under Tomie's spell, there apparently to kill her. At the last minute Fumihito decides to kill Tomie instead, chopping off her head and burning the remains. Yumi and Fumihito leave the hospital in relief.  
Titanic: The Legend Goes On
 The movie begins on a [[White Star Line]] chartered [[boat train]], boarding passengers to the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. A poor girl named Angelica, treated as a servant by her wicked stepmother and two stepsisters, dreams of finding both love and her missing mother, with only a blue locket as a clue to the mother's identity. At the same time, an upper-class English man named William boards with his nanny who laments the loss of her daughter years ago, as well as his secretary Gaston. Other passengers include the gold-digging Winnie, a failing banker named Jeremy McFlannel, a jewel thief named Corynthia Meanstreak, her two henchmen Kirk and Dirk, a detective named Sam Bradbury who has been sent to pursue them and Molly, a gorgeous singer. Also boarding in the cargo hold are a group of animals, including a family of Yiddish mice, some geese, a dog named Fritz, a magpie named Hector, and a band of Mexican mice. Throughout the voyage, the various passengers meet and interact. William and Angelica fall in love at first sight, while Winnie and Jeremy fall for each other after Winnie's dog Flopsy trips him. Gaston meanwhile attempts to woo Molly with Angelica's locket, which he found after she unknowingly dropped it. Sam goes undercover to find Corynthia while Kirk and Dirk make several unsuccessful attempts to steal jewelry from Winnie, but are foiled by her dog.  The film reaches its climax at a reception held in honor of the passengers. Angelica is able to attend with William after her cabinmate Victoria loans her a suitable dress. Meanwhile, the Yiddish mouse child Maxie discovers that Angelica is missing her locket and recruits the other animals to help search for it, finding it in time for her to wear to the reception. Upon seeing the locket being worn by Angelica and hearing the correct implication from one of the ship's officers that it was stolen when she received it, Molly slaps Gaston and leaves him. When Gertrude, Bernice and Hortense attempt to break up Angelica and William, Maxie scares them off. Kirk and Dirk manage to successfully steal a pearl choker from Winnie, but learn that it is a fake, as Winnie is not rich and uses fake jewelry to infatuate wealthy men.  The ''Titanic'' hits an [[iceberg]] and begins to sink as the passengers rush for the [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]]s. All of the animals escape on floating crates, rescuing the ship's cook in the process and being led to safety by dolphins. Winnie chooses to stay behind with Jeremy, who reveals to her that he is not the rich man she thought he was – he was on his way to America to be bailed out after his bank failed. Despite learning this, Winnie still loves him and they remain on the ship to die together. Molly also chooses to remain behind on the ship, singing with the band, and dies along with them. William grabs a small child to protect as he falls overboard, when the ship breaks in half and sinks beneath the ocean. He puts the child safely in a nearby boat but his foot is trapped in a rope from the ship's stern and he is dragged down with the ship, apparently dying. On one of the lifeboats, Angelica discovers that William's nanny is actually her mother and the two are reunited. They come across Sam in the water and pull him aboard. William surfaces (having somehow freed himself from the rope and staying alive underwater) alongside the boat and is reunited with Angelica. An epilogue reveals that the two were married and lived happily ever after, that Detective Sam Bradbury put Corynthia behind bars, Kirk and Dirk married Angelica's stepsisters and Gaston married a wealthy [[socialite]] hoping to live off her money but ended up in charge of her home's household chores.

Traffic (2000 film)
  ===Mexico storyline=== In [[Mexico]], police officer Javier Rodriguez (del Toro) and his partner Manolo Sanchez (Vargas) stop a drug transport and arrest the couriers. Their arrest is interrupted by General Salazar (Milian), a high-ranking Mexican official who decides to hire Javier. Salazar instructs him to apprehend Francisco Flores (Collins), a hitman for the [[Tijuana Cartel]], headed by the Obregón brothers.  Back in Tijuana, Flores, under torture, gives Salazar the names of important members of the Obregón cartel, who are arrested. Javier and Salazar's efforts begin to cripple the Obregón brothers' cocaine outfit, but Javier soon discovers Salazar is a pawn for the [[Juárez Cartel]], the rival of the Obregón brothers. That entire portion of the Mexican anti-drug campaign is a fraud, as Salazar is wiping out one cartel because he has aligned with another for profit.  Sanchez attempts to sell the information of Salazar's true affiliation to the DEA but is killed for his betrayal. Javier, who can no longer stomach working for Salazar, decides to make a deal with the DEA. In exchange for his testimony, Javier requests electricity in his neighborhood so the youngsters can play baseball at night rather than be tempted by street gangs and crime. Salazar's secrets are revealed to the public, and he is arrested and is shown suffering probable torture in prison.  Javier explains to the media about the widespread corruption in the police force and army. Later, Javier watches as children play baseball at night in their new stadium.  ===Wakefield storyline=== Meanwhile, Robert Wakefield (Douglas), a conservative Ohio judge, is appointed to head the [[President of the United States|President]]'s [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], taking on the title [[drug czar]]. Robert is warned by his predecessor (Brolin) and several influential politicians that the [[War on Drugs]] is unwinnable. Robert's daughter, Caroline (Christensen), an honors student, has been using [[cocaine]], [[methamphetamine]], and [[heroin]] which quickly develops into a drug addiction after her boyfriend Seth (Grace) introduces her to [[freebasing]]. Caroline, Seth, and Vanessa are all arrested when a fellow student overdoses on drugs, and they try to dump him anonymously at a hospital. As Robert and his wife Barbara (Irving) struggle to deal with the problem, Robert discovers that Barbara has known about their daughter's involvement with drugs for over six months.  Robert realizes his daughter is a drug addict, and is caught between his demanding new position and difficult family life. On a visit to Mexico, he is encouraged by Salazar's successful efforts in hurting the Obregón brothers. When he returns to Ohio, Robert learns his efforts to see Caroline rehabilitated have failed. She has run away to [[Cincinnati]], and no one knows her exact location. She steals from her parents to procure money for drugs.  Robert drags Seth along as he begins to search Cincinnati for his daughter. After a drug dealer who is prostituting Caroline refuses to reveal her whereabouts, Robert breaks into a seedy hotel room and finds a semi-conscious Caroline in the company of an older man. He breaks down in tears as Seth quietly leaves. Robert returns to Washington, D.C., to give his prepared speech on a "10-point plan" to win the war on drugs. In the middle of the speech, he falters as he realizes how futile this all is, then tells the press that the War on Drugs implies a war even on some people's own family members, which he cannot endorse. He then walks out of the press conference and takes a taxi to the airport. Robert and Barbara go to [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meetings with their daughter to support her and others.  ===Ayala/DEA storyline=== A third story is set in [[San Diego]], where an undercover [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] investigation led by Montel Gordon (Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Guzmán) leads to the arrest of Eduardo Ruiz (Ferrer), a high-stakes dealer posing as a fisherman. Ruiz decides to take the dangerous road to immunity by giving up his boss: [[drug lord]] Carl Ayala (Bauer), the biggest distributor for the Obregón brothers in the United States. Ayala is indicted by a tough prosecutor, hand-selected by Robert Wakefield to send a message to the Mexican drug organizations.  As the trial against Ayala begins, his pregnant wife Helena (Zeta-Jones) learns of her husband's true profession from his associate, Arnie Metzger (Quaid). Facing the prospect of life imprisonment for her husband and death threats against her only child, Helena decides to hire Francisco Flores to assassinate Eduardo Ruiz; she knows killing Ruiz will effectively end the trial ''[[nolle prosequi]]''. Flores plants a [[car bomb]] on a DEA car in an assassination attempt against Ruiz. Shortly after planting the bomb, Flores is assassinated by a sniper in retaliation for his cooperation with General Salazar. The car bomb meant to kill Ruiz instead kills Agent Castro, but Gordon and Ruiz survive.  Helena, knowing Ruiz is soon scheduled to testify, makes a deal with Juan Obregón (Bratt), lord of the drug cartel, who forgives the Ayala family's debt and has Ruiz poisoned. Ayala is released, much to the dissatisfaction of Gordon, who is still angry over his partner's death. During a phone conversation between Ayala and Metzger, Ayala deduces that it was Metzger who originally informed on Ruiz. Evidently in a bid for power with another drug cartel in Mexico, Metzger accepted $3 million to inform on Ruiz to the FBI and facilitate the Ayala organization's downfall. Ayala says that Metzger was planning on taking over Ayala's empire completely. As Ayala hangs up the phone, Metzger looks up to see two hit men entering his office. Soon after Ayala's release, Gordon bursts into the Ayala home during his homecoming celebration. Bodyguards wrestle him to the ground, but Gordon is able to surreptitiously plant a listening bug under Ayala's desk. Gordon is forced from the property, with the satisfaction of knowing that there is now a new opportunity to trap Ayala.  
Trapped in a Purple Haze
 [[Chicago]] college student Max Hanson (Jackson) is a talented artist and hockey player. Though more interested in the latter, he is under pressure from his mother, Sophie (Williams) to pursue a career in art, influenced by the fact that she put her own career aside to raise the family and has just landed a coveted position with a local art gallery. Max's father, Ed ([[Colm Feore]]), is a tax attorney with a more laid-back approach to his son's future, just wanting him to be happy.  While working at the local video store with best friends Orin (Christensen) and Kate ([[Amy Stewart (Canadian actress)|Amy Stewart]]), a cute girl comes in with her friends seeking a copy of ''[[Arachnophobia (film)|Arachnophobia]]'', and Max is immediately smitten. After locating her on [[campus]] the next day, she introduces herself as Molly White (Pope), who already knows Max's name from his hockey jersey. She then gives Max her phone number and invites him to a party she's attending that night. Before long, Max and Molly are becoming an item, the two even managing to make love in his bedroom with his mother and younger sister Chloe in the house. However, Max soon finds out that Molly is a [[drug addict]], as he accompanies her on a trek to score some [[heroin]], which she promptly snorts.  Max invites Molly to Chloe's birthday party, and though she initially refuses to attend because it's the same night as a [[Smashing Pumpkins]] concert, she later relents. However, a minor argument erupts between her and Sophie, resulting in Molly leaving abruptly and putting the brakes on their budding relationship. Devastated, Max does his best to move on, but has a hard time doing so. Finally, he's taken to a party one night by Orin and Kate, where he promptly spots Molly. She asks if they can go somewhere and talk; he accepts, she apologizes, and the two make up.  The next day, Max visits Sophie at work and tries to express his feelings about Molly, but her response is less than positive. A short time later, Molly celebrates their new-found relationship by having them [[shoot up]] together in her apartment, and Max soon becomes hooked, neglecting his studies and job. Soon thereafter, Molly learns that she's three months behind on rent, and has a week to pay before being evicted. Not having enough money in his bank account to pay it, Max goes to the video store to get his paycheck, but having only worked two hours during the past week, that's all the pay he receives, and he is also given a pink slip. Sensing his friend may be in over his head, Orin offers to try to help Max, but all he wants is money to supposedly "fix the car" (though Orin sees right through this flimsy claim).  After returning home, Max takes $200 from Ed's wallet; when he gently attempts to approach the subject with his son, even offering to help him out of his financial situation, an argument erupts that culminates in Sophie striking Max. Feeling as though he can never go back home, Max and Molly (who was kicked out of her place) move in with her druggie friends. Not long after, Max shows up at the ice rink attempting to steal money from Orin in the locker room, but is caught in the act (during which time we learn Max has been kicked off the team).  Once back at the pad, Max catches Molly having sex with a man in exchange for drugs, and physically confronts him. Later, as their financial situation worsens, the couple is reduced to panhandling at the local mall, where Sophie spots Max, but says nothing until a few days later. After hearing this news, Ed and his other son Brian attempt to find Max, but are unsuccessful.  His addiction now totally out of control, Max tries to rob a local comic book store for drug money, but is caught by the police. Ed and Brian later bail Max out, and while Brian thinks he needs to be put into [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]], Ed insists he can take care of Max at home. However, the effects of [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] are in full swing, and it proves to be an uphill battle. Finally, after going into a rage, Max becomes unconscious and is taken to a hospital.  Once there, an arguments erupts between Ed and Sophie, with Sophie insisting that she did what anyone else would have done, but Ed retorts "that's a bunch of crap" and reminds her that neither he nor the kids made her stop painting; she did it all by herself, and that in her self-absorbed attitude, she failed to notice that all Max wanted was "to know it was OK to not be perfect".  The next day, a doctor informs the family that Max needs to get into a treatment program, but stresses the difficulty of doing so. However, while this discussion takes place, Max manages to slip out of the hospital and begins frantically searching for Molly, finally finding her in a sleazy motel room where she has died of a [[heroin overdose]]. Out of his mind with grief, Max shows up at Kate's apartment and begs her for money; when she refuses, he accuses her of "wanting" him and offers to prostitute himself. Enraged, Kate throws Max out of the apartment, but in his stupor, he takes a tumble down the stairwell.  The following morning, after his family had searched unsuccessfully for him, Max is brought home in a taxi, Kate by his side. Informing his mother of Molly's death, the two tearfully embrace, and as he prepares to leave for his month-long stay in rehab, he and Sophie finally reach an understanding. Sophie admits that she never saw Max for who he was and encourages him to be whatever he wants, telling Max that she loves him as the two embrace again. The film ends with Max saying goodbye to Brian and Chloe as he departs for rehab, before he and Ed drive away.

Tripfall
 The family of Tom Williams make holidays in [[California]]. The family is kidnapped by Eddie, his girlfriend Lonnie and Franklin Ross. They want 1.2 million dollars.  
Tribulation (film)
  It is the present day. In their home, the family Camboro - Eileen, Calvin and Tom – reminisce a childhood memory of an afternoon picnic. Tom’s brother-in law Jason abruptly enters the kitchen. Jason makes unsettling comments about European President Franco Macalousso, an outspoken advocate for global peace and unity. Tom Camboro believes that Jason needs psychiatric help, to the disagreement of his wife Suzy, who distrusts hospitals and doctors.  Later that night, Tom is called to intervene on a crime. Tim Tucker, college professor on psychic theory and admirer of Macalousso, is being violent towards his Christian wife, denouncing the Bible as a lie. Tom arrives at their apartment, and is startled when Tim displays supernatural powers, such as wielding a knife without touching it. Tim abruptly snaps and commits suicide by jumping out the window.  Back home, Jason falls victim to a similar phenomenon, verbally abusing the Christian Eileen. He also concludes by jumping from the window in a fit of madness, yet survives. While Tom is driving Suzy to visit Jason in hospital, they argue about what happened. Suzy, having witnessed the event firsthand, reports to her husband that Jason was speaking insanely about Macalousso. Tom is troubled by this detail.  At the hospital, Jason tearfully begs Suzy not to allow the doctors to keep him. Eileen believes that Jason needs help from God, advice which angers Tom, who demands his sister to get a grip on reality. An argument ensues, in which Tom denounces the illogical nature of biblical stories. He eventually agrees to compromise by attending church next Sunday, so long as Eileen cease her preaching in future.  Meanwhile, an elite group of Satanists has been working behind-the-scenes to trigger similar phenomena worldwide. Using their collective psychic power, they intend to awaken supernatural capabilities hidden within all people. Back at the hospital, a doctor alerts the family that Jason’s mind has psychic areas active which usually remain closed. In his room, Jason sees a vision of a satanic man. The apparition tells Jason he was in the right frame of mind – anger, doubt and resentment of God – at the wrong time, but soon the whole world will follow suit. Jason screams in horror, drawing his family’s attention. Sensing trouble afoot, Suzy and Eileen determine to get Jason out of the hospital.  As Tom returns from checking the medical report, his way is blocked by two agents – presumably in league with the Satanists – who are searching for Jason. Tom manages to escape the hospital and get to his car. But before he can reach his family and warn them, the vehicle is telepathically caused to collide with an oncoming truck.  The film cuts to several years later, following the events of ''[[Apocalypse (film)|Apocalypse]]'' and ''[[Apocalypse II: Revelation|Revelation]]''. Tom awakens from a coma in the same hospital. The building is deserted except for another patient, Evan, who lacks one arm. Evan warns Tom not to trust anybody, and beware the VR Goggles. Confused, Tom leaves the room, but witnesses Evan being seized by guards and forced into wearing the goggles.  Evan is transported to an alternate reality, a vast expanse of empty whiteness, possibly Purgatory. He is bewildered to notice that his arm has been restored. Franco Macalousso appears before Evan and presents himself as the Messiah. Macalousso tempts Evan, offering him enhanced supernatural powers, in return for accepting the Mark of the Beast. Evan falls for the deal and accepts.  Having escaped the hospital, along with new clothes and a shaved face, Tom witnesses a similar event when a man named Ronnie is arrested and forced to wear the goggles. In Purgatory, Ronnie refuses to fall for Macalousso, naming him the Antichrist. Ronnie pays for his defiance when Macalousso conjures a snake that kills him. Seeing Ronnie’s body become still, Tom is shocked to notice that the people around him have ‘666’ burnt into their knuckles.  In the outside world, Helen Hannah, Suzy Camboro and Jake Goss are airing old Christian video tapes from a broadcast van, as part of a desperate attempt to denounce Macalousso as the Antichrist. During one broadcast, however, Hannah is captured.  That night, Tom returns to his house, where he is encountered by Calvin, who has accepted the mark. Tom tries to reason with his brother, including by mentioning Eileen, but Calvin shouts that they have no sister. Desperate to understand what is happening in the world, Tom begs for information. Calvin claims that the Devil and the Messiah are the same person – Franco Macalousso. He then attempts to force a pair of the goggles onto his brother, but Tom succeeds in overwhelming Calvin before he can resort to supernatural powers.  Tom flees into the forest, and comes across the same tree where he spent the afternoon picnic in his youth – Eileen had told him and Calvin to seek it should they get lost. As if by an act of God, Tom finds Jason at the tree. Jason informs his brother-in-law about what is happening in the world. The Christian Church has vanished in the rapture, Eileen included, and the world is ruled by O.N.E. (One Nation Earth), a puppet government headed by Macalousso and the Satanists.

U-571 (film)
 After sinking a merchant ship from an Allied convoy, German [[U-boat]] ''U-571'' has her engines badly damaged by depth charges from a British [[destroyer]]. ''U-571's'' skipper ''Kapitänleutnant'' Gunther Wassner makes a distress call that is intercepted by American intelligence. The [[US Navy]] has its submarine ''S-33'' modified to resemble a German resupply U-boat, to try to steal the [[Enigma machine]] coding device and sink the ''U-571''. Before the crew of ''S-33'' receives its assignment, the submarine's executive officer Lieutenant Tyler is unhappy about a recommendation for command of his own submarine being blocked by his commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Dahlgren.  During a storm, ''S-33's'' boarding party surprises and overwhelms the crew of ''U-571''. After securing ''U-571'', the American ''S-33'' is torpedoed by the arriving German resupply submarine.  Dahlgren is blown off the deck and seriously wounded; while struggling in the sea he refuses rescue and orders the boarding party on the captured U-boat immediately to submerge. Tyler takes command of ''U-571'' and dives below the surface, where they subsequently engage and sink the resupply submarine.  After making repairs and restoring its power, Tyler decides to route the disabled submarine toward [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]]. However, they are spotted by a German reconnaissance plane, which is unaware that ''U-571'' has been commandeered by Americans.  A nearby German destroyer sends over some crew, but before they arrive, Tyler gives orders to fire a shot from the deck gun, which destroys the ship's radio room, preventing it from reporting the situation and revealing that the Allies have the Enigma. The submarine then dives beneath the German destroyer, which begins to drop depth charges. ''U-571's'' original master ''Kapitänleutnant'' Wassner escapes captivity, and kills one of Tyler's crew, but he is subdued before he can sabotage the engines.  Tyler attempts to deceive the destroyer into stopping its attack, by ejecting debris and a dead crew member out of a torpedo tube, faking their own destruction.  However, the destroyer continues to drop depth charges. The crew realizes that Wassner, despite being shackled, is using Morse Code to tap out a signal that the submarine had been captured.  So they knock him out. ''U-571'' drops below , and is damaged by high water pressure. They start to sink, and can only reverse this by ascending uncontrollably. Tyler orders crewman Trigger to submerse himself in the [[bilge]] underwater to repressurize the single remaining torpedo tube.  Trigger uses an air hose to breathe inside the flooded compartment. He closes the air valve to the stern tube, but finds a second leak, which he can't reach. ''U-571'' surfaces heavily damaged and begins to flood, unable to fire its last torpedo. The pursuing destroyer fires with its main guns: the damage pins Trigger's leg, when he is beyond reach of the air hose. Unable to turn back, he manages to close the valve before he drowns.  Tyler orders Tank to fire the torpedo; the destroyer is unable to take evasive action and is sunk. As the crew sigh in relief, Tank reports Trigger's death. However, the submarine has taken severe damage, and so the crew abandons it with the Enigma in their possession. They watch ''U-571'' as she slips beneath the waves. They are eventually spotted and rescued from their lifeboat by a US Navy [[PBY Catalina]] [[flying boat]].  
Tweety's High-Flying Adventure
 On the 2nd of October 1900, when Colonel Rimfire, at the Looney Club in [[London]], announces about his beliefs that cats are the most intelligent, musical animals (after his many plans were foiled by [[Cool Cat (Looney Tunes)|Cool Cat]]), Granny, hoping to raise money for a nearby children's park, makes a wager that her Tweety can fly around the world in 80 days, collecting the pawprints of 80 cats in the process. Sylvester, still hoping to make Tweety his personal snack, is incensed at the thought of some other cat getting the little bird first and vows to follow Tweety around the world and catch the canary himself; unbeknownst to either one, a thief is also present.  Tweety sets a course to [[Paris]], but is blown by a strong wind to the Swiss Alps, where he gets trapped, as does Daffy Duck, but Bugs Bunny saves them both. Tweety goes back to Paris and outsmarts [[Penelope Pussycat]], where he causes [[Pepe le Pew]] to mistake Sylvester for a female skunk. Tweety continues on to [[Venice]], but grows overweight after eating too much bird seed. On a longboat, he faces a lot of cats, but he overpowers them and goes back to normal. While attempting to sleep in [[Egypt]], he is chased into a tomb by Sylvester and several other cats, but escapes. In the African jungle, he outsmarts [[Pete Puma]] and the lion with help from the Minah Bird.  In the Chinese Himalayas, he befriends another canary known as Aoogah (the name coming from her ability to imitate a horn), after rescuing her from a sacrifice. They are taken by more winds into [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]] and [[Japan]], and eventually make it onto a boat to the United States. However, Sylvester catches up with them, but [[Hubie and Bertie]] cause him to slide into the water. Tweety and Aoogah are able to save him, but end up on a beach in [[Australia]]. Sylvester meets [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Taz]] and they chase the two canaries, resorting to a motorcycle, but end up in the ocean.  Tweety and Aoogah ride a windsurfer to [[San Francisco]]. Sylvester hijacks a tram to chase them, but ends up on Alcatraz, to the fury of [[Yosemite Sam]], who appears as the tram's driver. The two canaries make it safely on a train to [[Las Vegas]], where they escape more cats. Afterwards, they go through more cities across the United States, finishing in [[New York City]]. There, they trick Sylvester into getting onto a concorde alone. The two canaries are caught up in an Atlantic hurricane and briefly washed up on an island, but outsmart more cats and escape back through the hurricane.  In a pub in the English countryside, they discover the thief and manage to outsmart him. Sylvester attempts to frame Tweety by passing his license to fly for a stolen passport. He almost succeeds, but the real passport is in his hand, thus getting himself arrested instead to frame Tweety and himself. Tweety and Aoogah believe they are a day late, until they discover that it's the 21st of December because they crossed the international date line. They are able to get back to London, only to find that they managed to get just 79 pawprints. Tweety then realizes he forgot Sylvester so he flies into the prison truck taking him away and is able to get his pawprint, thereby saving the park. Tweety gets happily knighted by the Queen and Sylvester goes to prison for just 50 days for trying to frame Tweety and vows for future revenge.  
Two Family House
  An unseen narrator (who we gradually come to learn is telling the story of his mother and step-father's romance) looks back to the year 1956, in the [[Elm Park, Staten Island|Elm Park]] neighborhood of [[Staten Island, New York]], to one Buddy Visalo (Rispoli), an Italian guy with "[[The Honeymooners|Ralph Kramdenesque]]" dreams. Buddy is a wannabe crooner (with a voiceover provided by [[Andrew Poretz]]). Buddy had nearly been discovered by [[Arthur Godfrey]] ten years earlier (shown in flashback) when he performed at a [[USO]] show while in the service. His fiancée, Estelle (Narducci), gave him a Hobson's choice: “Who's it gonna be, Buddy, Arthur Godfrey or me?” In a decision he’ll live to regret the rest of his life, he chooses Estelle, and over the next 10 years tries all sorts of schemes to get ahead. “I just wanna be somebody!” he’ll declare.  Italian-American Buddy decides to buy a dilapidated two-family house in the Irish section of town, intending to live upstairs with his wife Estelle and run a bar downstairs, where he could live out a smaller version of his dream, singing along to a "Music Minus One" jukebox (a precursor to karaoke). Estelle has no confidence in Buddy, just wants a “normal” blue-collar husband who, most of all, won't "embarrass" her by doing anything to make himself stand out, and manages to undermine his plans time and time again. He discovers, to his dismay and her horror, that the upstairs Irish tenants, a drunken, violent older man (played by [[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]]) and his very pregnant young wife (played by [[Kelly Macdonald]] of ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'' fame) refuse to move and won't pay rent.  When the baby is born, it's clear his father was black – and the much older, drunken Irish husband immediately skulks off, knowing it's not his child. Buddy evicts mother and child, then feels guilt and sets her up in a flat while she sorts out an adoption. Estelle's lack of faith, the small-minded prejudices and low ambitions of his “friends,” the Irish lass's spirit, Buddy's dream, racial prejudice, and the baby's fate play out in an engaging story with real chemistry between the leads and a message that ultimately exemplifies a [[Joseph Campbell]]-like "Follow your bliss."  
Ultraman Tiga: The Final Odyssey
  Set two years after Tiga's final battle, Daigo is approached by a mysterious woman, Kamila, who possessed a dark version of the Spark Lence. It is then revealed that more than 30,000,000 years ago, Tiga was originally evil in nature, part of a group of four that dominated Earth. The group consisted of Dark Tiga, the telepathic Kamila (gold patterns on silver skin), the powerful Dahram (red patterns on silver) and the speedy Hyudra (purple patterns on silver). One day, Tiga fell in love with a local human woman, and decided to convert from darkness to protect her from harm. Being the weakest of the four, Tiga quickly became a target of the group. However, unbeknownst to the group, the original "talentless" Tiga Dark possessed the ability to absorb powers from fallen enemies. As he eliminated each of the three dark members and sealed them away, he absorbed their powers which explains new Tiga's color patterns (purple, red and gold lined with his original silver). Convinced by his ability to convert the last known Spark Lence to good, Daigo accepts the gift and becomes Tiga once again, survives his inner struggles and vanishes the darkness within. Soon after this, he marries Rena Yanase, fellow GUTS member and longtime love interest (Shin Asuka, Dyna's eventual human host, also makes a cameo during the finale as a junior crew member, in a symbolic passing of the torch moment).

Unbreakable (film)
 In [[Philadelphia]] in 1961, Elijah Price is born with Type I [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], a rare disease that renders sufferers' bones extremely fragile and prone to fracture. As revealed later in flashbacks, Elijah—who grows up to become a comic-book art dealer—develops a theory, based on the comics he has read during his many hospital stays, that if he represents extreme human frailty, there must be someone "unbreakable" at the opposite extreme.  In the present day, another Philadelphia man, [[security guard]] [[David Dunn (character)|David Dunn]], is also searching for meaning in his life. He had given up a promising [[American football|football]] career during his college days to marry Audrey after they were involved in an [[Traffic collision|auto accident]]. Now, however, their marriage is dissolving, to the distress of their young son Joseph.  As he returns home from a job interview in [[New York City]], David's train, the Eastrail 177, crashes, killing the other 131 passengers. He is the only survivor, sustaining no injuries. At the memorial for the crash's victims, he finds a card on his car's windshield, inviting him to Elijah's store. Elijah proposes to David that he is the kind of person after whom comic-book [[superhero]]es are modeled and repeatedly pursues the issue with David and Audrey, trying to learn whether David had ever been ill or injured during childhood. Although Elijah unsettles him, David begins to test himself. While [[Weight training|lifting weights]] with Joseph, he [[bench press]]es about , well above what he had thought he could do. Joseph begins to idolize his father and believes that he is a superhero, although David still maintains that he is "an ordinary man".  David challenges Elijah with an incident from his childhood when he almost [[Drowning|drowned]]. Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic [[Trope (literature)|trope]] whereby superheroes often have one weakness.  He contends that David's weakness might be [[water]]:  it is easier for him to drown or choke than regular people. While surveying the stored wreckage of the train crash that he survived, David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door off the car in order to save Audrey. David used the accident as an excuse to quit football because Audrey did not like the violence of the sport.  Under Elijah's influence, David realizes that what he thought was just a natural "instinct" for picking out dangerous people during security checks is actually a form of [[extrasensory perception]].  Now consciously honing this ability, David discovers that when he comes into touch contact with other people, he is able to glimpse criminal acts they have committed.  At Elijah's suggestion, David stands in the middle of a crowd in Philadelphia's [[30th Street Station]]. As various people bump into him, he senses the crimes they perpetrated, such as theft and rape, and finds one he can act on: a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[janitor]] who invaded a family home, killed the father, and held the wife and their two children captive.  David follows the janitor to the victims' house, frees the children, and finds their mother dead, but the janitor ambushes him and pushes him off a balcony into a swimming pool. David nearly drowns since he cannot swim, but the children rescue him. He then attacks the janitor from behind and strangles him until he passes out, while he is once more uninjured. That night, he and Audrey reconcile. The following morning, he secretly shows a newspaper article on the anonymous heroic act, featuring a sketch of David in the hooded rain poncho he wore while confronting the janitor, to his son, who recognizes the hero as his father.  David attends an exhibition at Elijah's comic book [[art gallery]] and meets Elijah's mother, who explains the difference between villains who fight heroes with physical strength versus those who use their intelligence. Elijah brings David to the back room of his studio, extends his hand, and asks David to shake it. Upon doing so, David sees visions of Elijah orchestrating several terrorist disasters, including David's recent train accident, causing hundreds of deaths. David is horrified, but Elijah insists the deaths were justified as a means to find him. Calling himself "Mr. Glass", a nickname his peers had used to taunt him with when he was growing up, he explains that his own purpose in life is to be the villain to David's hero.  The film ends with David walking away in horror and disgust while Elijah taunts him, and screen captions reveal that David eventually reported Elijah's actions to the police, and that Elijah was convicted of murder and terrorism and committed to an [[Psychiatric hospital|institution]] for the criminally insane.

Urbania (film)
 ''Urbania'' follows Charlie ([[Dan Futterman]]) through a sleepless night. After an unsuccessful bout of [[masturbation]] to the sound of his upstairs neighbors having sex, he prowls the streets looking for a man he saw several months earlier. The implication is that he's had a [[one night stand]] with the man, cheating on his boyfriend Chris ([[Matt Keeslar]]). This is reinforced by several phone calls Charlie places, leaving messages on Chris' [[answering machine]]. As he's walking, he has momentary flashes akin to [[hallucination]]s or waking dreams: a man's mouth; a bottle breaking; a man with a blood-stained shirt.  After a series of encounters (with his upstairs neighbors, whom he tells about his masturbatory activities, and a potential trick), he meets the man he's looking for. His name is Dean (Samuel Ball) and it makes no sense either that he'd trick with Charlie or that Charlie would trick with him. Dean is unabashedly [[racism|racist]], [[sexism|sexist]] and [[homophobia|homophobic]]. Nevertheless, Charlie, pretending to be [[heterosexuality|straight]], buys Dean drinks and smokes a [[marijuana|joint]] with him. Dean takes Charlie to a gay [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] area looking for victims, but Charlie is able to warn away the intended target. Dean is now almost incapacitated by alcohol and drugs and Charlie gets him into Dean's car and drives him to a secluded marshy area.  As had been implied by Charlie's flashbacks, Dean and two of his buddies, several months earlier, had attacked Charlie and [[rape]]d and murdered Chris in an apparent [[hate crime]]. Charlie's purpose is finally revealed: he wants revenge.  In a dreamlike conversation with Chris, Charlie relates what happened at the marshland. He pulled a knife on Dean and told him why he was there. Dean didn't remember him. Charlie forced Dean to drop his pants and was disgusted to see Dean had an [[erection]]. Charlie forced Dean to kneel and [[fellatio|fellate]] the knife blade. Suddenly, Dean collapsed with an [[epilepsy|epileptic]] seizure. Charlie slit his throat.  Chris challenges Charlie, not believing that he killed Dean. Charlie admits that he wanted to but couldn't. Instead, he drove off in Dean's car, abandoning him in the marsh.  Charlie stands up from where he's been kneeling, at a makeshift memorial near where Chris was killed. He walks home and has one more hallucinatory flash. He sees himself on the street, cradling a dying Chris. He kisses Chris goodbye and passes by him. When he turns back, Chris is gone. Charlie makes it home and, finally, is able to sleep.  Charlie presents aspects of his story in the form of [[urban legend]]s. The film references a number of urban legends, both by having characters describe them as they're depicted and by presenting random people experiencing them.  
Uttara (film)
 In the pastoral expanse of rural [[Bengal]], in [[Purulia]] district, single [[railroad]] workers and best friends Balaram (Shankar Chakraborty) and Nemai (Tapas Paul) spend their days [[wrestling]] on a hill with little work to speak of because their flag station has only a couple of trains to be flagged off or signaled to.   Wrestling, however, despite its aggression and physical combat, turns into an expression of close bonding for Nimai and Balaram, a bond already established through their complementary work at the flag station. Wrestling, for them, is a way of releasing physical energy and a form of dynamic entertainment.  Amidst wrestling, they spend their time talking with the locals, who include Padri Baba, a local [[Christian]] [[pastor]] who lives in the village church and looks after his seven-year-old orphaned nephew, Matthew. He takes him along on his [[bicycle]] when he serves the lepers, the poor and the oppressed in the village.  There is a colony of [[dwarfism|dwarf]]s that inhabit this peculiar and mystic village. Each morning, they can be seen crossing the hillocks and pass through the forests to catch the daily public [[bus]] and go to their jobs. Among them is a grinning railway guard who is always in uniform with exaggerated mannerisms, alertness and paranoia.  There are also a troupe of masked dancers who pass across the village, mutely going about their rhythmic routine. There is a world below this in the village, consisting of a bunch of bumbling poor old men, Christians, who dream of travelling to [[United States|America]] by first reaching [[Kolkata]] with a complete lack of geographical knowledge.  At this point a couple of city yobs in fashionable clothing move around in the village in their jeep, downing bottles of [[beer]] to get rid of their boredom as they go stalking; what or who is unfolded towards the end of the film.  Balaram returns from visiting his aged aunt with wife Uttara (Jaya Seal), and her presence slowly but surely begins to tear their intense friendship building up to a disastrous, catastrophic climax. The people and their separate worlds are not really linked to one another. They appear like a collage of images that do not quite add up to make a meaningful whole. Yet, they describe, in their own way, the vulnerability of human life to greed, to lust, to violence, and ultimately death. The violent actions of the three [[Hindu]] extremists threaten the peace of the village, but a sliver of hope remains.  Uttara soon painstakingly learns the bitter truth that to her husband Balaram and his friend Nimai, as well as to the city-bred goons, she is no more than a piece of flesh to be devoured, [[rape]]d, violated and killed. Nimai, with a broken marriage before him, a marriage that exists only in remote memory, feels particularly jealous of Balaram because he has Uttara. Balaram is happy with this beautiful 'thing' he 'possesses' and therefore, can 'devour' at will, within the privacy of their bedroom or under the open sky against the backdrop of the fields.  With the two men's silent squabbles over Uttara, the apparent serenity of the village is disturbed, with an onslaught of violence, murder, blood and gore. The roaring sound of the speeding [[jeep]] metamorphoses into an eruption of barbaric violence.  The two fundamentalist city yobs torch the Christian missionary Padre tying him to a pole and burning him, and the whole church is set ablaze. A panic stricken Uttara cries out to Nemai and Balaram for help whilst the boy Matthew escapes unharmed. But their senses are blind and deaf and mute to the outer world and they go on wrestling.  Then as the dwarf railway guard offers Uttara hope for a better future, the goons kill him. They then chase a fleeing Uttara, rape and kill her. The scene of peaceful harmony is reduced to one of meaningless and futile violence. The camera pans to capture a glimpse of Uttara's violated corpse, the deadbody of the kindly railway guard, the fire in the church in the remote distance.  Amidst all the scenes of death and destruction, the film ends on a moving scene of living violence. A golden sky throws the two silhouetted wrestling figures of Nimai and Balaram in relief. The circle of moral decay, of an environment that easily lets the animalistic instinct within the man out, is complete. The group of masked dancers silently wrap a fleeing Mathew into their fold as he becomes one of them, offering only a tiny glimmer of hope in a world of despair.<ref name="Rediff.com"></ref>

  On his way home from a party, James Fhelleps is involved a car crash that kills his daughter Heather, and leaves his wife Alice disfigured, paralyzed and [[Catatonia|catatonic]]. While James aimlessly wanders the city, Alice is cared for by Barry, a [[Coprophilia|coprophilic]] physical therapist who sexually abuses her. One day, James gives a prostitute named Emmy Bruzze a lift to her house, where James experiences a [[psychotic break]] when Emmy tries to seduce him, resulting in him killing her. As James stares at Emmy's body in shock, it begins speaking to him in Heather's voice, begging for help and claiming that God is keeping her from him. James returns home, gets rid of all religious objects in the house, and holds a conversation with Alice, who he is convinced communicates with him telepathically.  James (who is revealed to have molested Heather) believes he can somehow bring Heather back and "beat" God by killing [[street people]], and those who associate with them. After murdering a perverted priest, James is held at gunpoint by Slick, a minion of "street king" Hell, but wounds his assailant, having one of his ears shot off in the struggle. A mob of homeless then attack James, forcing him to flee to his apartment, where he catches Barry having sex with Alice.

Up at the Villa (film)
 A recently widowed Englishwoman, Mary Panton ([[Kristin Scott Thomas]]), is staying at the villa of some wealthy friends outside of [[Florence]], Italy in 1938. After meeting her old friend Sir Edgar Swift ([[James Fox]]) at a party celebrating the [[Munich Agreement]], she is surprised when he proposes marriage to her the next day. She asks for a few days to think the proposal over, and he agrees to meet with her on his return from Rome.  That evening, at a party hosted by her friend, the Princess San Ferdinando ([[Anne Bancroft]]), she meets a married American man named Rowley Flint ([[Sean Penn]]), who has a reputation for being a rogue. A violinist ([[Jeremy Davies]]) arrives to entertain the guests but is so terrible that the Princess has him removed. Out of sympathy Mary leaves him a large tip. Rowley drives Mary home, but on the way stops at a small church, where she confesses that her husband was an abusive alcoholic who died in a car crash, leaving her destitute. Rowley tries to kiss her but Mary slaps him and drives away. She is so flustered that she almost collides with a young man in the road, who turns out to be the violinist from the restaurant. Seeing that he is poor and hungry, she invites him up to the house for a meal. He tells her that his name is Karl Richter and that he is a refugee from Austria, where he was persecuted for resisting the [[Nazi]] government. When the young man declares how beautiful Mary is, she has sex with him out of sympathy. He leaves the next morning.  That same day Mary is summoned to a meeting between the English expatriates and the city authorities, where the local Fascist administrator, Beppino Leopardi ([[Massimo Ghini]]), informs them that they will have to register with the police to continue living in Italy. Later that night, she is shocked when Karl appears in her bedroom, declaring that he loves her and wants to be with her. When she explains that she only slept with him out of "pity", he is enraged and attacks her. She grabs a gun given to her by Sir Edgar Swift, but Karl swipes the gun and aims it at her. At the last second, however, he shoots himself. In a blind panic and aware of the serious scandal that could result, Mary calls Rowley and pleads with him to assist her. He arrives and the two transfer the body to the woods down the road, where Rowley plants an unregistered gun of his so that the suicide cannot be traced back to Mary. He keeps Sir Edgar Swift's gun on him.  The next day the two appear to have escaped being connected with the suicide, until Leopardi arrives at Mary's. He announces that the Florence police have arrested Rowley for possessing a handgun belonging to Sir Edgar Swift which was not registered when he entered Italy. Aware that Rowley could be imprisoned and Edgar implicated, Mary seeks out the Princess. She gets the Princess drunk and coaxes her into admitting that she had once blackmailed Leopardi by sending him financial documents showing him to have embezzled money. Mary heads straight for the Princess' home, where she manages to steal the documents on the pretense of delivering flowers.  Mary goes to Leopardi's office and blackmails him with the documents to release Rowley. He is enraged but eventually submits to her demands so that she is able to take a wounded Rowley home. Although she admits to having feelings for Rowley, the two agree that he could not be faithful to her and they part. Later that evening Mary meets with Edgar, where she confesses everything that had occurred over the past few days. He is surprisingly understanding and says that he still wishes to marry her, but that he will have to give up the [[Viceroy of India|Viceroyship]] of India for fear of the story ever getting out and causing a scandal. Mary does not want to ruin his career, and ultimately admits that she does not love him and will not marry him. After he leaves Mary packs her bags to return to London. The Princess arrives at the villa, and tells Mary that she is a fool for rejecting the wealthy and powerful Swift because of her attraction to Rowley.  At the terminal the next day, Mary boards the train alone and is surprised when Rowley joins her in the car. He tells her that he is going to Paris, and the two agree to go together, indicating that they are both going to give the relationship a try.  
Uzumaki (film)
 The film consists of four parts ("A Premonition", "Erosion", "Visitation", and "Transmigration"). High school student Kirie's first glimpse that something is awry in the small town of Kurouzu comes when the father of her boyfriend (Shuichi) begins to film the corkscrew patterns on a snail; he is also in the process of making a video scrap book filled with the images of anything that has a spiral or vortex shape to it. His weird obsession threatens to go out of control. He proclaims that a spiral is the highest form of art and frantically creates whirlpools in his [[miso]] soup when he runs out of spiral patterned [[Kamaboko]]. He then becomes one with Uzumaki when he decides to crawl into a washing machine to get a 'point-of-view' shot for his film.  It is not long before the entire town is infected by the otherworldly whirls. Tamura, a reporter, is intrigued by Shuichi's dad's suicide and becomes obsessed with the case. Meanwhile, Kirie's high school is populated by a host of twitching teachers, preening pretty girls, and the slimy Katayama, who begins to walk at a snail's pace and only comes to school when it rains. Making matters worse, the student body is starting to sprout shells, drink water in copious amounts, and crawl on the walls of the school. Sekino, Kirie's classmate, begins to grow her hair in medusa-like curls that eventually take over not only ''her'' mind but the minds of all the girls in the school (save for Kirie). Meanwhile, in the hospital, Shuichi's mother, who was hospitalized after her husband's death, cuts off her hair and fingertips in order to get rid of anything spiral-shaped on her body, and grows so afraid of spirals that Shuichi is forced to tell the hospital to eliminate anything spiral-shaped so his mother may not encounter them (even going so far as to throwing away the cakes that Kirie had brought for her mother, since the frosting on the cakes were like whirls). Eventually, Shuichi's mother succumbs to her phobia and kills herself when a millipede tries to crawl into her ear to inhabit her [[cochlea]] and causes her to hallucinate about her husband, who tells her that "there's another vortex in the deepest part of your ear". It is not long before even the sky itself is cursed, with whirl-like clouds and the eerily smoky, ghost-like faces of the victims who perished in the grip of Uzumaki appearing during funerals.  Soon, everyone in Kurouzu has been caught in the curse of the vortex—Kirie's dad, who takes a drill to his eye after obsessively creating spiral shaped ceramics; the reporter who gives a special report on the horrors of the town and her crew, all of whom lose themselves in a tunnel only for their corpses to be found as snail-people; Sekino, whose body has been devoured by the snake-like curls; Kirie's stalker, who throws himself in front of Inspector Tamura's car and is twisted around the axle, the impact by Tamura's head leaving a spiral crack in the windshield; a police officer, who while he was admiring the spiral rifling in the barrel of his gun, shot himself in the eye, leaving a spiral hole in his head; and even Shuichi himself, whose body twists into a spiral and becomes possessed by it. Only Kirie is left in the cursed town of Kurouzu, and, in the end, her final fate is unknown as to whether or not she lives or dies.  
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
 Charlotte, a young woman, is abducted by Baron Meier Link, a [[vampire]] nobleman who is known not to harm humans needlessly. Charlotte's father, Elbourne, hires D, a [[dhampir]], to find her and rescue her, and alternatively, kill her humanely if she's been turned into a vampire. He offers D $500,000 as a down payment, and offers him $10,000,000 if he carries out the job. D has Elbourne double the payment, and agrees to search for Charlotte.  At the same time, Charlotte's older brother hires another group of vampire hunters, the notorious Marcus brothers, composed of the leader Borgoff, a hulking man named Nolt, a blade master named Kyle, a physically disabled [[Psychic power|psychic]] named Grove and a woman named Leila who hunts vampires because of a personal grudge rather than for monetary gain. The two parties (D and the Marcus brothers) race inexorably after Meier Link. However, Meier Link hires the mutant Barbarois; a group of lethal mercenary body guards. They consist of Caroline, a [[shape shifter]]; Benge, a shadow manipulator; and Machira, a [[werewolf]].   Throughout the course of the film, two of the Marcus brothers, Nolt and Kyle, end up being killed by the mutant Barbarois, while Leila and Borgoff continue their search for Charlotte.  As the story progresses, Meier Link's abduction of Charlotte turns out to not be as it seemed, as it's revealed that Charlotte willingly ran away with Meier Link as his lover. Charlotte rightfully feared that no one would understand their relationship, with her a human and Link a vampire.   Throughout their search, and after both characters save each other from seeming death at separate points, D has a conversation with Leila, where she reveals that she hunts vampires because a vampire killed her mother. D tells her that he hunts vampires as he has no other choice as a dhampir, and she can have a life that someone like him could never have; the life of a normal human. Leila, having not exactly taken the life of a normal human, instead being a monster hunter, fears that no one will mourn her death when that time comes. She make a pact with D, that if either one of them survives, the survivor will bring flowers to the other's grave. D admits that he does not expect himself to survive the bounty hunt, after coming so close to death.  In the final act of the film, Meier Link transports Charlotte in his carriage to the Castle of Chaythe, where Countess [[Carmilla]], Meier Link's matron, waits for them. Carmilla, a ghost of a vampire who died long ago, reigned supreme within the Castle of Chaythe when vampires were all-powerful and unchallenged. However, her bloodlust was so strong that D's father, an ancient, noble vampire king, killed her in disgust. Carmilla promises Meier Link and Charlotte travel to a far away city known as the City of The Night, where they can be free to love each other, which they will travel to in a large and ancient spaceship-like structure hidden beneath the Castle of Chaythe. Carmilla explains that most ancient castles had similar ships hidden within them, and that back when vampires reigned supreme, these ships weren't an uncommon means for vampires to travel to far regions. Carmilla notes that the ship is old and hasn't flown in a long time, and that she doesn't know if the ship will fly safely, but that Meier Link and Charlotte are allowed to take that risk, if they so wish.  D and the remaining Marcus brothers separately trail Meier Link to the Castle of Chaythe, and as they enter the castle in their search for Charlotte, Carmilla plays psychological tricks on them. Borgoff, for example, is shown Nolt and Kyle, the dead members of the Marcus brothers, returning to life. Borgoff is seemingly killed in his surprised and ecstatic state by Carmilla's ghost, and it turns out Nolt and Kyle never returned to life at all. Later, however, Borgoff appears, having been turned into a vampire. Grove appears in his psychic form, killing Borgoff, but this exerts Grove's physical body to the point that he dies as well. This leaves Leila as the only surviving member of the Marcus brothers as she continues her search for Charlotte inside the castle.   Carmilla manipulates D's mind, and shows him a vision of his mother, in which she apologizes to D for birthing him as a dhampir, and states that she couldn't help it as she was a human in love with D's vampire father, and attempts to explain that humans are capable of loving vampires. D strikes this vision of his mother down with his sword and returns to a normal state.   In a [[plot twist]], Carmilla turns on Meier Link and Charlotte, as Carmilla had actually plotted to kill Charlotte all along, with the reasoning being that Carmilla needed the blood of a virgin to leave her ghostly, ethereal form and return to life. D destroys Carmilla's ghost just as Carmilla is performing the ritual and draining Charlotte of her blood. D, still with a job to do in bringing Charlotte safely back home, engages Meier Link in battle, as Meier Link doesn't want D to take his lover away from him. D stabs Meier Link through the chest with his sword, but not through his heart, injuring Meier Link but allowing him to live. During their encounter, Charlotte has died due to the ritual that Carmilla had been performing previously, and D takes the ring off of her finger as proof of her death to bring back to Elbourne, as he ceases battle with Meier Link.   D, along with Leila, make their leave of the Castle of Chaythe, and allow Meier Link to leave for the City of the Night in the Castle of Chaythe's ship with Charlotte's corpse on board. D and Leila agree to ride back into town together on D's horse, as Leila jokingly tells D that the reward is rightfully hers, but this time, she'll allow him to have it. Before riding off, they watch in the distance as the ship hidden underneath the castle takes off to the skies with Charlotte's corpse and Meier Link inside.  In the final scene of the movie, D arrives at Leila's funeral, watching her loved ones mourn from a distance. Many decades have passed since all of the previous events, as a little girl revealed to be Leila's granddaughter approaches and greets D, and invites him to stay with her family for a while. D politely declines, saying that he simply came to "repay a favor to an old friend, who feared no one would mourn her death." D admits that he was glad she was wrong. The girl thanks him, and D replies by smiling gently at her, and leaves.

  While climbing in [[Monument Valley]], siblings Peter (O'Donnell) and Annie Garrett (Tunney) lose their father, Royce ([[Stuart Wilson (actor)|Stuart Wilson]]): after two falling amateurs leave the family dangling, Royce forces Peter to cut him loose to save Peter and his sister. Peter has since retired from climbing and become a full-time wildlife photographer, and Annie has gone on to become a renowned mountain climber. Their relationship is strained, as Annie still blames Peter for obeying Royce instead of waiting for her to secure the rope.  Three years later, during a wildlife photo shoot for ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', in the lower Himalayas in Pakistan, Peter's assistant falls, breaks his leg, and has to be evacuated by the [[Pakistani Army]] stationed in a military station that monitors avalanches. Peter is dropped off at [[K2]] Base Camp and searches for Annie, who is planning a summit attempt on K2, the world's second highest and most dangerous mountain. The expedition is funded by wealthy industrialist Elliot Vaughn (Paxton), who is also taking part. (He wants to attempt climbing the K2 for the second time, as his first attempt ended in tragedy with him as sole survivor.) Vaughn has the help of renowned climber Tom McLaren ([[Nicholas Lea]]); other expedition members include Pakistani mountaineer Ali Nazir.  The day before the climb Vaughn throws a promotional party with all the people at base camp. The gala is interrupted by reclusive Montgomery Wick (Glenn), reportedly the world's best climber and K2 foremost expert, who asks if it will be Vaughn or the experienced McLaren who will be making the decisions during the climb, as the team cannot have two leaders. Vaughn states that McLaren is the leader and later explains that Wick is against him because his wife, a Sherpa guide, was one of the people who did not survive his previous expedition. During that climb, they were hit by a storm and got lost in the mountain. Wick's wife died of [[High altitude pulmonary edema|pulmonary edema]] on their way down because she forgot her supply of [[dexamethasone]], the only medicine capable of preventing it. Wick has never believed that story and has spent years trying to find his wife's body.  The climb turns out to be a disaster, as Vaughn forces McLaren to continue despite the radio warning from base camp director Skip Taylor ([[Robert Taylor (Australian actor)|Robert Taylor]]) of a storm approaching. As the storm closes in, the winds begin to wreak havoc and cause an [[avalanche]]. Annie, Vaughn, and McLaren fall through a patch of ice and become trapped in a [[crevasse]], while the other expedition members are killed. Radio contact is lost, but Peter remains by the radio and hears Annie using static to send a [[Morse code]] signal to inform base camp that they are alive.   Peter manages to assemble a rescue mission with some of the climbers at base camp, including base camp director Skip Taylor, brothers Cyril and Malcolm (Le Marquand and Mendelsohn), who are experienced climbers looking for adventure, Monique Aubertine ([[Izabella Scorupco]]), who needs the money from the reward offered by Vaughn's company, and Kareem Nazir ([[Alexander Siddig]]), who is Ali's cousin and wants to help even if he knows that his cousin is already dead. Skip and Peter also visit Wick, who agrees to join in the rescue attempt but requests that Skip remain behind, as Wick says that he needs someone he can trust at base camp directing the mission.  The teams form, pairing experienced mountaineers with less experienced ones: Malcolm and Kareem, Cyril and Monique, and Wick and Peter. After an eventful helicopter drop-off, each team takes a different entry point up the mountain to increase chances of success. They each carry an old canister of nitroglycerine donated by the Pakistani Army to clear out the entrance to the crevasse.   Monique and Cyril encounter trouble when Cyril loses his balance and clings to the side of a cliff. After Monique secures her harness to him, the peak cracks, and Monique also falls over the edge. Their leaky nitro canisters explode beneath them while they hang from ropes. Cyril is able to climb back up, but an avalanche caused by the explosion throws him over the edge again, without a rope this time. Monique, who survives because she was still under the cliff's edge, pulls herself up despite several broken fingers, and radios base camp that Cyril has been killed.   Back at the military station, the nitroglycerine canisters are exposed to sunlight and explode. Base camp tells the teams to get their cases of nitroglycerin into the shade. Kareem and Malcolm do so, but, while resting after covering the cases, the leaked nitroglycerin is eventually exposed to sunlight and explodes, killing the two.  Meanwhile underground, McLaren is severely injured, with a broken leg and ribs, and he has lost his dexamethasone. Annie shares her dex with him, but Vaughn refuses it, stating that every climber should take care of his/her own supply or risk death. Annie risks her life to reach Ali's body and backpack, and manages to obtain additional dex for both McLaren and herself, but Vaughn tells her that McLaren is unlikely to survive, and therefore, they should keep all the dex for themselves.  The nitro explosions have shaken loose some ice, and Wick finally discovers his wife's body in a glacier. The empty dex box near his wife's suggests that Vaughn lied and stole her dex, thus ensuring his own survival while leaving her behind to die from pulmonary edema.   Monique joins up with Peter and Wick, and the three spend the night on the mountain. Peter is wary of Wick, fearing he might be more intent on taking revenge than in rescuing his sister.  Meanwhile in the crevasse, Annie falls asleep, and Vaughn kills McLaren with a dex syringe [[air embolus|full of air]] to save the remaining dex for himself. Annie suspects Vaughn but decides not to confront him and instead to save her strength, as she is already suffering from pulmonary edema.   Wick awakens to find that Peter and Monique have gone already towards their destination, leaving him behind as they no longer trust him. Peter signals Annie their position, and Annie and Vaughn manage to mark the crevasse entrance by launching a homemade flare and using McLaren's blood as paint. Peter and Monique use the nitroglycerin to blast a hole, enabling access to the survivors and are joined by Wick, who promises Peter that he will rescue Annie.   Wick descends into the cave and harnesses Annie, and although the weakened Vaughn thinks he is about to attack him, Wick attaches a harness to him as well. Wick and Peter attempt to pull Annie out of the crevasse, but an ice boulder falls, knocking Wick and Vaughn from the ledge in the crevice, and pulling Annie and Peter down.   Monique alone remains on the ledge holding the rope onto which the other four are hanging. To save Annie and Peter, and to fulfill his revenge on Vaughn, Wick pulls a knife from his pocket, says a Buddhist prayer, and cuts the rope holding himself and Vaughn dropping the two to their deaths.  Recovering at base camp, Annie reconciles with Peter, who finally pays his respects at a memorial for those killed on K2, including Kareem, his cousin Ali, Cyril,  Malcolm, Tom McLaren, Wick, and his wife.  
Versus (2000 film)
 Unknown to the world, there are 666 portals on Earth that connect this world to the [[Hell|other side]] which are concealed from human beings.<ref></ref> However, there are some who are aware of their existence and are willing to locate and open the gates of the portals to obtain the power of darkness for their own use. Somewhere in Japan, there exists the 444th portal known as ''The Forest of Resurrection''.  In 10th century Japan, a lone samurai fends off a horde of zombie-like samurai creatures. Though successfully vanquishing the zombies, the samurai is confronted by a mysterious priest and his league of warriors. In an attempt to take out the mysterious priest, the lone samurai charges full scale but is easily killed and defeated. However, before dying, the lone samurai spots an ally behind him, who arrives too late to save him.  In present-day Japan, two prisoners escape through a forest and meet up with a gang of [[Yakuza]]s. When Prisoner KSC2-303 ([[Tak Sakaguchi]]) sees a girl (Chieko Misaka) that the gang kidnapped, he immediately becomes suspicious of what they plan to do with her. After a heated argument, Prisoner KSC2-303 kills one of the Yakuza members who immediately comes back to life as a zombie. The zombies are killed and Prisoner KSC2-303 escapes back into the forest with The Girl. The Yakuza decide to disobey their orders to wait for their leader and pursue Prisoner KSC2-303 and The Girl.  Prisoner KSC2-303 and The Girl come across a man crucified upon a tree. Prisoner KSC2-303 steals the dead man's clothes and is confronted by one of the Yakuza. They engage in hand-to-hand combat while the other Yakuza begin facing problems of their own. The corpses of all the men they have killed and buried in the forest resurrect and attack them. Prisoner KSC2-303 and the other Yakuza abandon their fight to battle the zombies.  With the horde of zombies growing, the Yakuza call upon three assassins to aid them in their mission. The Yakuza leader, The Man ([[Hideo Sakaki]]), finally arrives and confronts them, angry that they lost Prisoner KSC2-303 and The Girl. The Yakuza and Assassins take the upper hand and kill him first. But The Man easily jumps back to his feet and turns the Assassins and Yakuza into his own minions. Two of the Assassins escape and find Prisoner KSC2-303. One is defeated by The Girl with a log, and the other is confronted by The Man and killed.  Prisoner KSC2-303 attempts to force The Girl to tell him what is going on, believing that she has been hiding secrets from him the whole time. Before explaining thoroughly, The Man finds Prisoner KSC2-303 and The Girl. The Man begins explaining to Prisoner KSC2-303 that they are reincarnations of past lives. The Man plans to use The Girl as a sacrifice to open the portal hidden in The Forest of Resurrection and obtain the power of darkness. Unable to accept his explanations, Prisoner KSC2-303 attempts to kill The Man but is killed himself instead.  The Girl manages to reach Prisoner KSC2-303's body and feeds him a part of her blood before being taken by The Man's minions. During his unconscious state, Prisoner KSC2-303 experiences a flashback of his past life in the 10th century; he is the ally that was too late to save the lone samurai in the opening scene of the movie. He and The Girl (who is revealed to be a princess) are confronted by the mysterious priest (who turns out to be The Man) and his gang. Outnumbered and facing long odds, Pre-Prisoner KSC2-303 reluctantly kills The Girl to stop The Man from obtaining the power of darkness. Enraged, The Man viciously kills Pre-Prisoner KSC2-303. Prisoner KSC2-303 is awakened in the present with the truth fully revealed to him.  The following morning, Prisoner KSC2-303 confronts The Man and his minions for a final showdown. Prisoner KSC2-303 takes on the minions first and wins, leaving only The Man left. Prisoner KSC2-303 decapitates The Man and rescues The Girl, and both make their escape from The Forest of Resurrection.  99 years later, Earth lies in ruin. The reincarnation of The Man travels through the remains of a city, and eventually confronts Prisoner KSC2-303 and the reincarnated versions of The Man's gang (who now work for KSC2-303). The Girl, held against her will, tells The Man that she should have been on his side 99 years earlier. With nothing left to destroy in this world, Prisoner KSC2-303 asks The Man to take him to the Other Side. The Man and Prisoner KSC2-303 charge at each other and engage in battle one more time.  
Vatel (film)
 The story takes place in 1671. In the context of the [[Franco-Dutch War]], a financially struggling [[Louis, Grand Condé]] is visited by King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] for three days of festivities at the [[Château de Chantilly]]. The Prince wants a commission as a general, and spares no expense in order to impress the king. In charge of organizing the event is [[François Vatel]], Master of Festivities and Pleasures in the prince's household. Vatel is a man of great honor and talent, but of low birth. As the great Condé is prepared to do anything in his quest for stature, the tasks assigned to Vatel are often menial and dishonourable. While Vatel tries to sustain dignity amidst the extravaganza he is meant to orchestrate, he finds himself in love with Anne de Montausier, the king's latest lover, who returns his affections. However, due to their incompatible social standing and the rigid hierarchy of the court, continuing the liaison is clearly impossible.  In the last day of the visit by the King Louis XIV, Vatel realizes that he is nothing more than a puppet in the hands of his superiors, bought and sold like a piece of property, after learning that the Prince of Condé has "lost" him in a card game with the King. Disheartened and refusing to leave his people (the servants of the Château) and go to work for the King, Vatel consequently commits suicide by throwing himself on his sword. Nevertheless, the word that goes to the King by his own court members is that Vatel killed himself because the roast was not sufficient to feed several unexpected guests, the clouds dulled the fireworks display and he lacked confidence that there would be enough fish for the morning meal. This explanation pleases the King very much. Anne de Montausier is grief-stricken upon hearing the news, but knows she must not speak of it. In doing so, she flees the court quietly and no one ever hears about her and Vatel again.

Varian's War
 While in Berlin during ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in 1938, journalist Varian Fry (William Hurt) witnessed the [[Nazism|Nazi]]'s brutal treatment of Jews. He was physically sick and felt helpless to help the victims that the brown-shirted thugs had clubbed to the ground. The experience left him with a resolve to do something to help the Jews.  Back in the United States, Fry begins to canvass his influential friends and acquaintances, only to find indifference and even, anti-semitism. Learning that the Nazis have targeted artists and [[intelligentsia]], he approaches the State Department with a plan and a few names including artist [[Marc Chagall]] (Joel Miller), scrawled on a list. When the State Department tries to block his plans to head back to Europe, Fry finds an ally in First lady Eleanor Roosevelt (Sheena Larkin) who intervenes on his behalf.  In 1940, heading for [[Marseille]] in Nazi-occupied [[Vichy France]], where he knows that Jewish artists have taken refuge, Fry arrives with money to bribe officials.

Word spreads quickly in Marseille that an American will help Jews to escape Vichy France. In setting up an office out of his hotel room, Fry encounters Miriam Davenport (Julia Ormond) who helps him screen the numerous refugees that begin lining up at his hotel.  Two other accomplices approach Fry, Albert Hirschman (Matt Craven), a Jewish con-man that he names "Beamish", and Bill Freier (Alan Arkin), a counterfeit expert.

Despite the difficulties of the job, clowning is Will's one escape from the realities of his miserable existence: Will genuinely likes kids, and takes great joy from making them happy on their birthdays.  Struggling to make ends meet, but not wanting to give up his dream job, Will comes up with the idea to be a "bachelor party clown." Will's idea is that men throwing [[bachelor party|bachelor parties]] can hire him as well as a [[stripper]]; Will enters the room prior to the "real" entertainment, wearing clown makeup and lingerie, tricking the bachelor into thinking that there was a mix-up and a [[gay]] clown stripper has been sent in lieu of a female one. Will invents the persona of Vulgar the Clown (after his friend Syd tells him that the entire idea is "vulgar") and solicits himself in the want-ads. Before long, he is hired to appear at a bachelor party being held at a nearby motel.   When Will arrives for the party &mdash; wearing stockings, garters, clown makeup, and a trench-coat &mdash; he is attacked and brutally beaten by a middle-aged man, Ed, and his sons Gino and Frankie. The three men then proceed to [[gang rape]] Will, taking turns videotaping the attack. The trio hold Will hostage in the motel room for an indeterminate amount of time, during which they subject him to a series of violent and humiliating [[sexual assault]]s. They also break a bottle over his head and drug him. A tearful Will goes home and spends the remainder of the night and part of the next morning crying while he washes himself clean in the bathtub.   Will spends a considerable amount of time after the attack in a crippling [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], which nearly costs him his home. Eventually, Will fulfills a promise to appear as a clown at one of his past clients' children's party. When he gets to the party, Will discovers a [[hostage crisis]] is occurring; the father of one of the children, in the middle of divorce proceedings, has kidnapped his own daughter and is threatening to kill her. In a near-suicidal reaction, Will sneaks past the police barricade, breaks into the house, and subdues the father. News reporters capture some of the event on film, and before long the story makes national headlines. Will becomes known as "the hero clown;" the attention and outpouring of support breaks him out of his depression, and he is eventually given his own syndicated children's television show.  The media coverage attracts the attention of Ed and his sons (who are still raping young men). They threaten Will with a copy of the tape of his being raped (edited to look like amateur porn) and begin to [[extortion|extort]] him. When Will tries to pay the men off, they attack him in a bathroom stall. Will finally strikes an agreement with the men wherein he will come to a motel room and "perform" for them, allowing himself to be taken advantage of again, and they will give him all of the copies of the tape; secretly, Will plans to ambush and murder them with the help of Syd.   When the time comes, the gun jams and Will finds himself unable to kill his tormentors. Just as Ed and his sons move in to rape and murder Will, Ed's son Frankie accidentally shoots himself in the face. Then, a shootout ensues with a vagrant lowlife at the hotel, who robs Syd and then plots to do the same to the others. Both the man and Ed's other son (Gino) shoot each other to death. Ed panics, and Will chases him through the motel parking lot to a nearby deserted playground. As Will approaches him with gun-in-hand, Ed has a massive [[heart attack]] and dies. Will takes off as he hears police sirens coming. His [[conscience]] clear, Will retrieves the tape and goes on to live happily ever after, hosting his television show.  ===Extended ending=== The director's cut [[DVD]] features an extended ending, wherein Will finds a note from Syd along with a clipped newspaper article on the Fanelli's death, Ed's heart failure from panic and overdose of [[crack cocaine]], as well as attributing Ed's sons' (as well as the vagrant lowlife's) deaths to a random incidence of criminal violence and natural circumstance. A stunned Will breathlessly determines that the men's deaths were all [[karma|karmic]] retribution.  ===Extended opening=== The director's cut [[DVD]] features an extended opening, with Will waking up in his bed late for his gig (it is circled and marked on the calendar). He screams at his malfunctioning alarm clock and quickly throws his clothes and make-up on--becoming "Flappy".

Two brothers, Angelo Argono ([[William DeMeo]]) and Paulie Argono (Conor Dubin) are leading a poor and boring life on the streets of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], along with their childhood friends Pete (Daniel Margotta) and Dominic "Dom" (John Palumbo). Brooklyn is owned by [[mob boss]] Santo Minieri ([[Joe Viterelli]]), an old but ruthless crime boss. The Argono brothers are working in a local [[restaurant]] belonging to Mr. Letto (Robert Constanzo) as [[waiter]]s. Although they can't stand their boss, they are forced to work there.  All changes when Angelo decides to quit his job. He, Paulie, Pete and Dom borrow cash from a [[loan shark]] called Hector and start a [[bookie]] business, although their Uncle Tommy (Raymond Serra) doesn't like the idea. The business goes well and more and more money goes into Angelo's crew's pockets from losing customers. Because of the success, they are able to sit in a luxury [[strip club]] (owned by Minieri) and drink expensive drinks.  Problems appear when Angelo fights Minieri's men and they are thrown out by Vinny and his guys. The crew then starts collecting more and more money, and hotheaded Angelo comes to the idea of [[racketeering]]. They setup a [[protection racket]] in a [[candy store]], but when they come to collect the cash, they are confronted by Vinny who takes them to his father's home. Santo tells Angelo to give him one good reason not to tell his [[bodyguard]] Eddie (John Hoyt) to take him out and beat him to death. Angelo explains that they're just trying to earn money and it would be good if they could work with Santo. Santo takes the offer.  After saving Vinny's life and doing some errands and jobs for Santo, Angelo is now right-hand-man of the crime boss. Vinny doesn't like this and prepares to kill Angelo's gang and his father to be the neighborhood boss. Santo soon has a [[heart attack]] and dies, and Vinny understands that it's now a perfect chance to kill the wannabes and become the crime boss. He ambushes Angelo, Pete and Dom (Paulie wasn't there, he was on a date) with his men and kills them in a [[drive-by shooting]].  When Paulie returns, he sees what happened and has a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] of his childhood, while crying. Suddenly he stops crying and goes to Vinny's house. There he finally kills Vinny and his two bodyguards, saying "And you're the fucking wannabes". The film then ends.  
The Way of the Gun
 Parker and Longbaugh are a pair of low-level petty criminals, living off the grid and funding their existence through unconventional and often illegal means. Wanting to move past petty crime, they vow to get the proverbial "big score." While at a sperm donation clinic, the pair overhear a telephone conversation detailing a $1,000,000 payment to a surrogate mother for bearing the child of money launderer Hale Chidduck. Parker and Longbaugh resolve to kidnap the surrogate, Robin, but their attempt escalates into a shootout with her bodyguards, Jeffers and Obecks. The kidnappers are able to elude the bodyguards, who are arrested.  Jeffers and Obecks are bailed out and returned to Chidduck by his right-hand man Joe Sarno. As Sarno begins coordinating Robin's rescue, Longbaugh contacts her gynecologist, Dr. Allen Painter, and orders him to a truck stop to examine Robin. After the examination, Painter returns to Chidduck, and it is revealed that the doctor is Chidduck's son. It is also revealed that Jeffers and Chidduck's wife are romantically involved.  Longbaugh calls from a motel south of the Mexican border and demands a $15 million ransom. Jeffers and Obecks, tempted by the money, begin forming a plan to save the child and keep the money. As Longbaugh hangs up the telephone outside the motel, he is approached by Sarno, who offers to pay $1 million if they surrender Robin and simply walk away. Longbaugh declines the offer and returns to his room, where Parker and Robin are playing cards. Sarno then returns to Chidduck's home to plan the next step.  Jeffers comes to realize that Robin is Sarno's daughter. Jeffers, Obecks, and Painter leave to meet with the kidnappers, while Sarno departs separately with the ransom. At the motel, Parker is having second thoughts. As he confers with Longbaugh outside the motel room, Robin takes the opportunity to seize a shotgun and barricade herself inside.  As sirens are heard in the distance, Parker and Longbaugh hastily escape, and Robin emerges just as Mexican police arrive, followed by Jeffers, Obecks, and Painter. As Painter and the bodyguards try to persuade Robin to leave with them, the officers pull their guns and order everybody onto the ground. Parker and Longbaugh open fire from a nearby hilltop, and the shootout leaves the two officers dead and Obecks wounded. Jeffers shoves Painter and Robin into his car and drives off.  Parker and Longbaugh torture Obecks to learn Robin's location, while Jeffers confines Robin in a room in a Mexican brothel. Jeffers forces Painter to perform a Caesarean section to retrieve the baby, despite Robin's confession that the child is hers and Painter's and is not Chidduck's. Meanwhile, the heavily armed Parker and Longbaugh infiltrate the brothel. The ensuing gunfight, which leaves Parker wounded, turns into another standoff, until Painter shoots Jeffers. Outside, Sarno arrives with a group of men and the ransom, which they stack in the courtyard. Parker wants to kidnap Robin and Painter again, but Longbaugh, guilt-ridden after seeing her condition, responds: "She's had enough". Despite realizing that the money is bait, Parker and Longbaugh charge headlong into an ambush.  All of Sarno's men are killed in the ensuing firefight. However, Sarno manages to shoot and cripple the already wounded Parker and Longbaugh, and then calls for an ambulance. Painter emerges with Robin and the baby. Lying in a pool of blood, Parker and Longbaugh call out to Sarno, informing him that the baby is in fact Robin and Painter's, and thus Sarno's grandson. Parker wonders aloud if this fact will influence Sarno to let them keep the child. Robin and the baby are then taken away in the ambulance with Painter, Sarno and the money, leaving Parker and Longbaugh to die. Days later, Chidduck's wife reveals that she is pregnant.

The film takes place over one lunch hour on day 28 of the month-long competition.  Things start to become complicated as the office prepares for the company founder's retirement party.  The film is a [[dark comedy]] and often uses [[surrealism]] to achieve its thematic goals.  The cast includes [[Fab Filippo]], [[Don McKellar]], Marya Delver and [[Michelle Beaudoin]].  The film's title is derived from a particular form of suicide where one smashes the (non-openable) window of one's high-rise office and then jumps through.

Werckmeister Harmonies
 It is set in an anonymous, desolate, isolated small town in Hungary during [[Hungarian People's Republic|Communist]] times.  The film starts with János Valuska conducting a poem and dance with drunken bar patrons. The dance is of the total eclipse of the sun, which disturbs, then silences the animals. It finishes with the grand return of the warm sunlight.  János' older friend György is a composer, and one of the [[intelligentsia]]. György observes the imperfection and compromise of the musical scale (as defined by Andreas Werckmeister a historical theorist). György proposes changes to the scale to make it more harmonious.  György's estranged wife tries to leverage her political and social status by giving György a list of names to recruit for the "clean up the town movement" (with the blessing of the police chief).  However, a stuffed smelly [[circus]] [[whale]] and its star performer, "The Prince", come to town in the silence and darkness of night. János philosophizes about God and the whale.  János goes to the [[post office]] to pick up newspapers for delivery. The workers are unsettled by the ominous signs of the circus' arrival and are disturbed by the cloud that settles over each town it visits.  György's struggling cobbler brother gets the list and passes it on to the agitated throbbing masses in the town square who are unhappy at public services failing. György's former wife sleeps with the drunk gun toting police chief.  The presence of the whale and the Prince stir up the masses. János overhears the circus master losing control of his faceless Prince, who is becoming drunk with his own voice of revolutionary dogma. The circus master disowns him. The Prince, now free, inflames the masses, and the people [[riot]]. The rioters are brutal. Their inhumanity almost seems normal and natural. When the rioters finally come to beat a helpless old naked patient, they see their impotent, sad and powerless selves.  After the riot, János comes across the diary of a rioter. It explains that the rioters did not know what they were angry with; so they were angry at everything. Then it recounts the mobs horrendous rape of two working class post office girls.  János comes across his killed cobbler neighbor who got naively involved in the riot. János is told, by this cobbler's wife, to leave town for his own safety.  He is intercepted by a [[helicopter]]. He finds himself committed to a mental institution with caged beds (a tool of the time for dealing with political dissidents). János appears drugged and broken.  György, his composer friend, is evicted from their society house but gets to live in a shed in the garden whilst György's former wife, with her new status as a collaborator, now occupies the big house with the police chief. The intelligentsia is displaced by political opportunism.  György tells a vacant János, in the ward, that if he is released from the [[mental institution]] they can live contentedly together in the shed with his piano. György also mentions that he has re-tuned the piano so that is now like any other, a personal capitulation apparently abandoning any present hopes of reform. János just stares.  It finishes with György looking directly into the eye of the whale, then, walking away and looking back at the now sad and disheveled whale, destroyed by the rioters the night before, its rotting carcass slowly enveloped by the fog which gets whiter and brighter. Warm bright sunlight returns.

Several days later, Mary returns home alive and well, saying that she was with her mother in [[Rhode Island]] after a fight with Warren.  Claire sees the image of a woman floating in the lake, and discovers a key inside a heater vent. In a broken picture frame, she finds a newspaper clipping of a missing woman named Madison Elizabeth Frank, who bears a striking resemblance to her, and whose initials match "MEF."

When Norman arrives home from work, Claire's personality has noticeably changed, and she aggressively seduces him.  However, she suddenly stops, as she remembered that one night she had found Norman and Madison together, a fact that actually later provoked Claire's car accident.

She finds that Norman has left the bathroom and discovers him seemingly unconscious downstairs. She flees in the couple's truck, which has their boat hitched to the back. As she is crossing the bridge over [[Lake Champlain]], Norman attacks Claire, who frantically dials 911 on her cell phone and causes the truck to careen down the embankment into the lake and dislodge towards Madison's car. Disturbed by the debris, Madison's corpse floats toward Norman and Claire. To avenge her own death, Madison grabs and drowns Norman, allowing Claire to swim to the surface. Later in the winter, Claire places a single red rose on Madison's grave.

Harold accompanies him to one and meets Susan ([[Annette Bening]]), a recovering alcoholic.  He must marry her before he can try to mate. After their wedding in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], Susan finds herself wildly satisfied by Harold, even though men from his planet have no genitals and he has been equipped for his Earth visit with a penis that makes a loud whirring sound whenever he gets an erection.  Harold and Susan have a difficult time conceiving a baby. Meanwhile, Roland Jones ([[John Goodman]]), an employee of the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] who learned of Harold's odd behavior on an airplane, has become obsessed with proving him to be an alien and being the first one to find him.  When the child is born, Harold, following orders, abandons his wife and returns to his planet, but his sadness over hurting Susan leaves him with guilt and second thoughts even though people from his world theoretically have no emotions, so against the wishes of Graydon, he returns the baby to Susan and tells her the truth.  Susan is angry, grateful, and completely disbelieving.  Harold offers to prove that he is in fact an alien and does so just as Roland arrives, viewing Harold's "act of proof" through the window.  Instead of forgiving him and welcoming him back into their relationship, Susan breaks down in tears, saying, "I thought I had things right but then I married an alien!"  Harold leaves.  Once outside, Harold sees Roland, who is delighted to know he was right all along about Harold being an alien. Roland implores Harold to come with him and admit this to his wife, who doesn't believe him about Harold. Harold charitably agrees, but before that can happen, Graydon shows up with a phaser. Holding Harold at gunpoint, he declares he's taking Harold back. Roland pulls his gun on the leader, who brags, "none of your primitive weapons can hurt me, and I can heal instantly from anything," and shoots him in the chest. Graydon falls dead into the fountain.  Susan comes outside and says she thinks they should try to patch things up after all. Roland happily walks off with Graydon's alien body. Susan and Harold retake their vows in the wedding she says she always wanted. On the drive home, he tells her that the citizens of his planet want him to take over as leader. They discuss it, but she doesn't want to move since all her friends are here, and she knows nothing about the school system there. Harold grudgingly agrees to make the very long commute.

When Andrew Came Home
 On the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]], Gail is forced by the courts to hand over her five-year-old son, Andrew, to his father Ted for the weekend. Ted arrives with his young girlfriend, Pattie, and seems jealous over the relationship Gail's boyfriend, Eddie, has with Andrew. Despite her [[maternal bond|maternal instinct]], Gail gives her son to her ex-husband, who promises to return him on time as he always does.  When Andrew is late returning, Gail tells police that her ex-husband kidnapped her child. The police fail to file a report. Meanwhile, Ted is driving a sleeping Andrew away from his mother's house. In the morning, they are stopped by the police for speeding right before they cross the state border. Since no report is filed, Ted and his girlfriend are not stopped from kidnapping Andrew.  Five years later Gail has married Eddie, and they have an infant son together named EJ. Gail has kept Andrew's room exactly the way he left it with a few presents for all the birthdays and Christmases he missed. One day while tending to the baby, she gets a call from Ted telling her to meet him at a [[Telephone booth|phone booth]] and to not call the cops. After being given the runaround by Ted, Gail yells at her ex-husband and asks him if Andrew is coming home. He tells her that Andrew will travel to the [[bus station]].  Despite losing all hope of finding her son and thinking that Ted lied to her, Gail still goes to the bus station. After a bus arrives and Andrew does not show, Gail is about to leave when another bus arrives and Andrew gets off. He is dirty and has no luggage. Gail runs to greet her son, but gets no response from him. She places her son in the back seat of her SUV and sits beside him, but Andrew prefers to sit on the floor curled up. Gail buckles Andrew in, and the three go home.  Gail and Eddie show Andrew his room. Andrew pushes the presents off the bed and begins to jump it. He makes grunting noises of delight, but still has not said a word. His grandmother walks to the room with EJ and Andrew grunts and holds out his arms, wanting to hold the baby. His grandmother places the baby on the bed and Andrew cuddles with his [[Sibling|half-brother]].  At dinner, Andrew starts to show more of the effects that his father had on him. While his mother is [[Grace (prayer)|saying grace]], Andrew starts eating the spaghetti with his hands. Gail brushes this off, saying that Andrew must be hungry. Later that night, Andrew is unresponsive when she sings their nightly song. He turns away from Gail when she tries to kiss him and screams when she turns out the lights. After Gail turns on a nightlight and leaves the room, Andrew goes into a [[fetal position]] and goes to the corner of his room.  Gail takes Andrew to both a doctor and a psychiatrist and they learn that Andrew has eyesight problems. The psychiatrist later tells Gail that Andrew cannot read or do math, but is very bright. They want to send Andrew to a [[special school|special residential school]] to help him catch up in his academics. Gail refuses to part with her son once again, so Andrew goes public school so he can socialize with the other children.  While at school, a bully named Carl Rudnick makes fun of Andrew because he only stands on the side during recess and does not talk to the other children. During a game of baseball, when another child hits the ball in Andrew's direction, he just stands there and lets the ball fall to the ground and roll away. This makes Carl furious and he yells at Andrew, who responds by urinating on Carl. The principal calls both Gail and Carl's mother. Mrs. Rudnick calls Andrew a freak and says that he should not be in public school, even yelling at Andrew after he apologizes. After Carl and his mother leave, Gail has a discussion with the principal. He wants to hold Andrew back, but she refuses and takes him out of the school.  Andrew also acts strangely at home. While driving one day, Andrew screams after seeing a car that resembles his father's car and still does not talk to his mother, not trusting her. On his tenth birthday, Andrew sticks his face into his [[birthday cake]] for no reason at all, and later he speaks for the first time, telling his mother that he doesn't know why he did it and that he thinks his mother is trying to trick him. One night before dinner, he's playing with a glass of milk and it accidentally falls off the table, almost injuring EJ on the floor. Andrew's behavior angers Eddie and he begins to fear for his own son. After Andrew accidentally sets the house on fire, Eddie takes the baby and they go to live with his mother for a few months.  Gail begins to teach Andrew at home. Slowly but surely, Andrew makes progress, and things seem to get better for the family, with Eddie and EJ even moving back into the house. However, a woman with [[Social Services]] tells Gail that this is not good enough and if Andrew isn't on [[grade level]] by the time the summer ends, then she will be forced to send him to the special school. In order to help Andrew, Gail takes him to her brother's farm so he can learn in a new atmosphere where he has no history.  Andrew shows how intelligent he is by being able to learn how to milk a cow and how to care for the animals very quickly, but is unable to subtract 2 from 7. Gail cries to her brother saying that she loves Andrew and thanks God every day for his safe return, but misses her old son, adding that if she had a choice to pick her son, it wouldn't have been Andrew.  Having overheard this conversation, Andrew runs out of the house. Gail runs after him and eventually finds him in the stables. She says she didn't mean what she said, but Andrew doesn't believe her. His father told him that she did not want him anymore and that she didn't love him. Gail explains that that isn't true, that she looked for him every day and missed him every minute during the five years he was gone. She told him she loves him and he will always be her son. After crying, Andrew falls asleep in the stables and Gail watches over her son.  He wakes up startled and in fear when Gail tries to place a blanket over him for warmth. She tells him he doesn't have to be afraid, and then Andrew finally opens up and tells his mother about his experiences with his father.  They never stayed long at any place and he was not allowed outside during the day. The last place they stayed the longest was a rundown trailer.  He was usually locked in a room all day by himself, watching TV. Both adults were abusive; Pattie would hit him, and Ted would lock him in a dark closet. At night, they put him outside, tied to a long leash, where he would sleep in the trees in the dark with the frightening sounds of the nocturnal animals surrounding him. Andrew was not allowed to go to school or socialize with other children his age, or anyone other than Ted and Pattie for that matter. He told his mother how he would think about her and home, but then get angry that she didn't love or want him. Then he explains that now he knows she did love him and want him. He then tells his mother that he is home, and the two cry in each other's arms and sing their bedtime song together.  In the end, it is revealed that Gail and Andrew returned home to Eddie and EJ to build a healthier life together and that Ted was tried for kidnapping and abusing Andrew, found guilty, and was imprisoned.

The Whole Nine Yards (film)
  Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky ([[Matthew Perry]]) is a Quebec dentist from Chicago, who happens to be genuinely likable to almost everyone who knows him. However, he is trapped in a miserable marriage to the daughter of his late business partner. His wife Sophie ([[Rosanna Arquette]]) and mother-in-law (Carmen Ferland) hate him, and his deceased father-in-law has saddled him with a lot of debt. He can't divorce his wife because her father embezzled from the dental practice, and he has nothing but debt if they separate. As the movie opens, Sophie tells Oz she needs $5000, but won't say what for.  At the office, Oz and his assistant, Jill ([[Amanda Peet]]) have lunch and she tells him that his wife isn't a good person. They joke about the fact that, due to his insurance, he's worth more dead than alive, and discuss having her taken out of the picture, and Jill playfully tells him to name a price. When Oz gets home, he meets his new neighbor, "Jimmy Jones." After recognizing a tattoo on Jimmy's forearm, realizes that he's Jimmy "the Tulip" Tudeski ([[Bruce Willis]]). Tudeski is an infamous contract killer from Chicago who was given a shorter sentence after ratting out Laszlo Gogolak and other members of the Gogolak gang.  Oz runs home in a panic and explains to Sophie that their new neighour is a hitman on whom there is a contract.  Sophie shows interest in the contract and in Jimmy.  Later, while Jimmy asks Oz to join him for a sudden trip to the city in order to get to know each other. Oz befriends Jimmy and reveals his marriage problem: his father-in-law got involved with an underage boy, whose family blackmailed him. Oz's father-in-law embezzled money to pay off his blackmailer and then committed suicide, saddling Oz with the debt. Jimmy sympathizes with Oz and the two become friends. However, when Oz returns home, Sophie tells him she has arranged for him to fly to Chicago, then collect a finder's fee by giving up Jimmy's whereabouts to Lazlo's son, Janni ([[Kevin Pollak]]). Oz argues against this, saying he quite likes Jimmy and that he has paid his debt to society.  Sophie says that if he does not do it, she will make his future life hell.  Upon arriving in Chicago, Oz has lunch with an old reporter friend and confesses that he has no intention of meeting with Janni or giving up Jimmy; unfortunately, when Oz returns to his hotel room, he is greeted by Franklin "Frankie Figs" Figueroa ([[Michael Clarke Duncan]]) who is one of Janni's enforcers. Frankie tells him they know he has come with information about Jimmy, though he will not confirm where the information came from; Oz denies any knowledge of Jimmy; Frankie roughs Oz up to get the truth out of him and then takes him to Janni.  At Janni's estate, Oz meets Cynthia ([[Natasha Henstridge]]), Jimmy's estranged wife. Janni instructs Frankie to accompany Oz back to Canada and keep an eye on Jimmy until Janni and his men arrive to take him out. Back at the hotel, Oz calls Jimmy in a panic, warning him to run, but Jimmy casually reassures him everything is okay, that he knows what Oz has done. The more he reassures Oz, the more scared Oz becomes.  He is then visited by Cynthia, who asks Oz if he really knows where to find Jimmy, explaining that Janni and Jimmy both want her (as well as each other) dead in order to collect on $10 million, which is being held in trust in their names (the "whole nine yards" of the title). Oz explains that he never wanted to do it, that his wife arranged things, and that he doesn't want anyone to die.  Oz and Cynthia share a bottle of scotch and end up sleeping together after he says she is the most beautiful thing he has ever seen and that his whole life has been leading to this moment. Afterwards, Oz vows to find a way to protect Cynthia from Jimmy.  Back in Canada, Frankie and a very nervous Oz enter another hotel room and see Jimmy waiting inside. It turns out that Frankie and Jimmy are old friends and, together, are planning to take out Janni and Cynthia. Jimmy explains he knew about the Chicago visit because Sophie wanted to hire him to kill Oz, an earlier hit having been called off for some unknown reason.  Jimmy and Frankie both praise Oz's sincerity and loyalty, even to a wife that hates him, and let him know about their plans to lure Janni to Montreal and kill him preemptively. Revealing that Sophie approached him to kill Oz, Jimmy offers to kill Sophie as a favor to Oz, which he refuses. Oz returns to work and tells Jill about the events in Chicago. Jill is extremely excited when she finds out that Jimmy 'the Tulip' is Oz's neighbor and makes Oz take her to meet him. Jill tells Jimmy that he's her hero and the reason she wants to be a contract killer. She also tells him that Sophie tried to use the $5000 to have Jill kill Oz, but Jill ended up liking Oz after getting to know him (like nearly everyone else does) and refused to follow through on the contract, cancelling it.   Jimmy enlists Jill's help, and as Jimmy and Jill discuss the upcoming ambush, Oz gets angry and says that he won't stand by and let them kill Cynthia. Oz goes back home and tries to call and warn Cynthia about Jimmy's plan, but she is already on the way with Janni. When Janni's gang arrive at Oz's house, Oz gets a chance to warn Cynthia, while she warns him that Janni will kill him after killing Jimmy. The two watch from Oz's garage as Janni's gang walks into the trap.  Down the street, Sophie and her new hired hitman (Harland Williams) are in his car. She is discussing the payment and promises that her mother will pay the remainder of his fee after the job is done. The hitter cuts their rendezvous short when he recognizes Janni Gogolak heading toward Jimmy's house. When Sophie tells him whose house it is, he realizes what's about to happen, pulls out a gun and exits the car, taking the car keys with him.  When Janni enters the house, he is distracted by a naked Jill, and she, Jimmy and Frankie are easily able to kill Janni and his men. Oz and Cynthia make a break for it. Sophie's hitter is in the yard when he hears Oz's car peel out behind him.  This draws Jimmy's attention to the window. He has Jill use nakedness to get the mystery hitter's attention and then Jimmy shoots him. Sophie sees this and runs, screaming, down the street. When they get the body inside, they realize he is an undercover [[Surete du Quebec|Sûreté du Québec]] detective constable.  As they begin to bag and dispose of the bodies, Oz calls. While they are on the phone, Jill reveals that Oz slept with Cynthia in Chicago — which she thinks is great — but it infuriates Jimmy, who feels that friends shouldn't sleep with each other's wives. Oz suggests a deal with them that will benefit everyone. Back at his office, he alters the cop's teeth to exactly match Jimmy's. They then put the cop's body and Janni's into Oz's car and set it on fire, rendering the bodies unidentifiable, except by dental records.  The next day, two investigators arrive at Oz's office, convinced that Janni and Jimmy are both dead. The investigators also find the undercover cop's car when they go to check out Jimmy's house. Inside the car is a tape recorder with Sophie and the undercover cop's conversation to kill Oz, the contents of which are more than enough to put Sophie and her mother in prison, even though Sophie claims that Jill is also a killer, but they do not believe her story. The police clear Oz of suspicion and he jokingly asks if they know any good divorce lawyers. The confirmation of the deaths of Jimmy and Janni allows Cynthia to collect the $10 million, using the required two death certificates.  As part of the deal, she agrees to transfer the money to Jimmy in exchange for her and Oz's lives.   Some time later, the key players meet up in the city. While Cynthia and Jill go to the bank to transfer the money, Oz heads to an art museum with Jimmy, where they will be around people and Oz thinks he'll be safe. Jimmy has other plans though and takes Oz (along with Frankie Figs) out on a private yacht. Back at the bank, Jill urges Cynthia to split the money with her and run, leaving Jimmy to kill Oz when he is double-crossed. Cynthia realises that she loves Oz and can't leave him to be killed by Jimmy. Jill tells Cynthia that it was a test, and that Jimmy wants her and Oz to have $1 million as a wedding gift, which can be collected only when they show a wedding certificate.  Cynthia wonders about the divorce, and Jill points out that Jimmy is officially dead.  The two women make the transfers.  On the boat, Jimmy gets the call that the money has been received. He pulls out a gun and points it at Oz. Frankie grins knowingly before Jimmy turns and shoots him instead; Jimmy explains that he had to kill Frankie or Frankie would kill Oz and then potentially come after Jimmy himself or send others after him in the belief that Jimmy had gone soft. Oz is floored, but happy to be alive. He tells Jimmy that the supposed softness may be because it's obvious Jimmy's in love with "her."  Jimmy feigns confusion, asking if Oz is referring to Cynthia. Oz looks at him silently.  In the next shot, Jill runs towards the dock and jumps into Jimmy's arms. Oz leaves to meet Cynthia. As soon as he sees her, he asks her to marry him. She looks disappointed and asks if Jimmy told him, but when Oz asks what she's talking about, she realizes he truly doesn't know about the million dollars and then happily agrees to marry him, and when he says he hopes she won't mind marrying a poor dentist, she replies she is sure they'll be okay. In the closing scene, Oz and Cynthia are on a hotel balcony overlooking Niagara falls, dancing to a bluesy version of Ira Gershwin's "[[They All Laughed (song)|They All Laughed]]" as the credits roll.

Once the elephant reaches them, she asks if Whispers trumpeted like that and he says yes and asks why she is all alone. The elephant then tells him that his trumpet is that of a "strong heart". Whispers recognizes it as something his mother used to tell him and it is finally revealed that the elephant herself is actually his mother, who has been searching for him for a long time and who managed to escape the hunters at the beginning.

Wild Flowers (2000 film)
 A Film Story playing from spring to winter and covering 80 years of human life. Seven dramatic human life stories that may play anywhere and in any century. They tell the everlasting story of passion, love desire, obsession and selfiness.  The whole story, the Ballads were written by Czech poet [[Karel Jaromír Erben]] a century ago and yet they are still here and alive. Therefore the authors of the movie decided to choose seven of the ballads and make them a film poetry of a very new style. It is a composition of photography, music and fascinating landscape and architecture.  The first ballad – '''Wild Flowers''' - is full of emotions and opens the whole world of different feelings and emotions of the human being as well as fairy tale creatures. It carries the name Bouquet and tells a story of little orphans crying for their mother . The mother hears their cries and prayers and comes back to them in the form of a little flower.   '''The Waterman''' is a fascinating slightly horror story about a waterman who falls in love with a country girl. Most of the scenes are shot really in the water and make this very authentic. It is again an eternal story about love, passion, different aspects of motherhood and discrimination.  '''The Noon-Day witch''' is tells of a desperate, tired mother and a greedy old noon witch. The mother is frustrated when her child is noisy and bothering her in every respect, therefore she calls the witch to give the boy a lesson - however she regrets her desperate deed immediately, its consequences are irretrievable.   '''The Wedding Dress''' is a romantic horror played between our world and the world of the dead.  '''The Daughter’s Curse''' is in fact an unfortunate misunderstanding between two different generations. It deals again of the often complicated mother-daughter relationship, especially when the daughter is handicapped and the mother wants “the best” for the poor child. In the end the daughter cannot cope with the freedom and curses her mother.   '''The Golden Spinning Wheel''' is a colourful story about the confusing similarity of faces when characters are totally different. It is a great opportunity for one actress who plays both the good and the wicked girl. However the bad ones get punished and the good ones are rewarded as in any good fairy tale. The photography uses the beautiful colours of the fall and the beauty of the landscape.  The last ballad '''The Christmas Day''' is closing the circle of a human life in the person of an old woman who accepts her death as a natural ending of her life. She feels in peace with God and her fellow people and knows that she didn’t live in vain.  The persons of individual stories keep meeting in between their ballads as on a merry-go round. It is a great poetry composed of pictures, music and words that accompanies us home and makes us ponder over the sense of life and death, love and hate, tolerance and discrimination, tenderness and wild passion for a long time.

Using his powers to detect the rising evil on the campus,  Spanner does some detective work and manages to discover that the Sinobia sisters have possessed the three actresses. As the sisters have no further use for the director, they sacrifice him to speed Abadon's arrival  One of the nuns of the school holds the literal key to hell, the stone key the possessed Maria was looking for. Spanner receives help from Sister Seraphina (Anita Page), but the witches kill Sister Seraphina to obtain the key. Due to the rising death toll, the campus is evacuated. Colleen is then possessed, giving the witches the additional body they need to open the hellish portal.

Abadon attempts to seduce Will to the dark side, but with the help of Garner and Lutz he is able to save the Earth and just barely prevent Satan's return. <ref>http://www.mandatory.com/fun/578379-the-series-project-witchcraft-part-4/2#dxPE2bdKlvV7Mc6m.99</ref>  
Wild About Harry (2000 film)
   
Woman on Top
 All her life, Isabella has suffered from [[motion sickness]]. Because of her illness she couldn't play much with other children. She stayed at home and learned how to cook, becoming a renowned chef as an adult. She fell in love with Toninho and they opened a restaurant together, with Isabella stuck in the kitchen and Toninho out front taking the credit.  The only way for Isabella to control her motion sickness is to control her motion. She must drive, take stairs instead of elevators, lead while dancing, and be on top during [[coitus]]. Feeling emasculated by this, Toninho has an [[affair]] with a neighbor. Isabella flees Brazil for San Francisco with her [[Afro-Brazilian]] [[transsexual]] friend, who spent her early years with her in the fishing community of Salvador. Despite old job offers from a number of restaurants, Isabella is unable to find a job until she takes over a cooking class at a local culinary school. Cliff, a neighbor and local television producer, smells her cooking, follows her to class and signs her to host a live cooking show, ''Passion Food''. She makes Monica her assistant on the show. Isabella performs a sacrifice to [[Yemanja]], a Brazilian sea goddess, to harden her heart and make her never love Toninho again.  Back in Brazil, Toninho's restaurant is floundering without Isabella. Toninho curses Yemanja, and the fishermen stop catching any fish. He figures out that Isabella has gone to Monica and follows her to San Francisco. He spots her on television and tracks her to the studio. With a group of local street musicians, Toninho sneaks into the studio and onto the set, serenading Isabella on the live broadcast. Cliff hires Toninho and the musicians for the show over Isabella's objections. Isabella pursues a relationship with Cliff but Toninho continues trying to win her back.  Network executives offer to syndicate Isabella's show nationally, but only after demanding a number of changes, including firing Monica. With the restaurant closed, Toninho apologizes to Yemanja, but tells her to "stay out of [his] business" with Isabella. He quits the show and makes another attempt to win back Isabella. Isabella goes after him but has to take an elevator, and her motion sickness slows her enough to allow Toninho to depart. Isabella also quits the show rather than accept the changes demanded by the network.  Isabella, with her love still gone but now wanting it returned, tries to cook another sacrifice to Yemanja but finds her cooking talent is gone. Undaunted, Monica substitutes some boxed [[macaroni and cheese]]. Isabella makes the second offering but nearly drowns. She has a vision of Yemanja, who rejects her new offering.  Isabella goes to collect her things from the television studio. Toninho, sent by Monica, shows up and suggests they cook something together. As they cook, the fish return to the village waters and Yemanja returns Isabella's original offering along with her love for Toninho.  The film closes with Toninho and Isabella operating a new restaurant as equal partners and with Cliff and Monica as a couple.

Wonder Boys (film)
 Professor Grady Tripp ([[Michael Douglas]]) is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pittsburgh university. He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell ([[Frances McDormand]]), whose husband, Walter ([[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]]), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].  Grady's students include James Leer ([[Tobey Maguire]]) and Hannah Green ([[Katie Holmes]]). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing [[fiction]] more than he first lets on.  During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of [[Marilyn Monroe]] memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually, he realizes that much of what James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, and is seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy.  Meanwhile, Grady's editor, Terry Crabtree ([[Robert Downey Jr.]]), has flown into town on the pretense of attending the university's annual WordFest, a literary event for aspiring authors. In reality, Terry is there to see if Grady has written anything worth publishing, as both men's careers depend on Grady's upcoming book. Terry arrives with a transvestite whom he met on the flight, called Antonia "Tony" Sloviak (Michael Cavadias). The pair apparently become intimate in a bedroom at the Gaskells' party, but, immediately afterwards, Terry meets James and becomes infatuated with him, and Tony is unceremoniously sent home. After a night on the town, Terry and James semi-consciously flirt throughout the night, which eventually leads up to the two spending an intimate night together in one of Grady's spare rooms.  Tired and confused, Grady phones Walter and reveals to him that he is in love with Sara. Meanwhile, Walter has also made the connection between the disappearance of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia and James. The following morning the [[Pittsburgh Bureau of Police|Pittsburgh Police]] arrive with Sara to escort James to the Chancellor's office to discuss the ramifications of his actions. The memorabilia is still in Grady's car, which has conspicuously gone missing. The car had been given to him by a friend as payment for a loan, and, over the weekend, Grady has come to suspect that the car was stolen. Over the course of his travel around town, a man claiming to be the car's real owner repeatedly accosted Grady. He eventually tracks the car down, but in a dispute over its ownership the majority of his manuscript blows out of the car and is lost. The car's owner gives him a ride to the university with his wife, Oola, in the passenger seat, with the stolen memorabilia.  Grady finally sees that making things right involves having to make difficult choices. Grady tells Oola the story behind the memorabilia and allows her to leave with it. Worried that Grady's choice comes at the expense of damaging James's future, Terry convinces Walter not to press charges by agreeing to publish his book, "a critical exploration of the union of [[Joe DiMaggio]] and Marilyn Monroe and its function in American [[Mythopoeia|mythopoetics]]", tentatively titled ''The Last American Marriage''.  The film ends with Grady recounting the eventual fate of the main characters – Hannah graduates and becomes a magazine editor; James was not expelled, but drops out and moves to New York to rework his novel for publication; and Terry Crabtree "goes right on being Crabtree." Grady finishes typing his new book (now using a computer rather than a typewriter), which is an account of the events of the film, then watches Sara and their child arriving home before turning back to the computer and clicking "Save."  
Witchouse 2: Blood Coven

During an experiment, the professor mingles her blood with DNA fragments from Lilith's remains leading to her possession. One by one, the students transform into members of the coven to wreak havoc on the town that betrayed and killed them over 300 years ago.  
Work in Progress (2000 film)
 A tall, thin inventor with a wisp of white smoke for hair (voiced by [[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]]) is in a large workshop with his dumpy, cigar smoking assistant (voiced by [[Tony Haygarth]]) working on designing and building a huge gorilla. The conversation between them explains to the user that the pair have created all of the animals on their world, but only with the help of a small girl; except for one, the chihuahuaraffe, a chihuahua body with a giraffe neck and head, which has severe stability issues resulting in it tripping over constantly.  They then 'fire up' the gorilla and bring it to life. The gorilla promptly sits up and smashes through a wooden platform causing the assistant to be flung across the workshop. The gorilla looks very rough with exposed metal and large sewing marks along its chest. It sits there and chews on some of the wood from the platform.  The short then cuts to the small girl working across a beach and through a forest towards the workshop. This scene demonstrates a number of CGI technologies, including: particle simulation (shown with clouds, water and sand) cloth simulation (with the girls clothing),  fur/hair simulation (with the girls hair and the fur on a chipmunk) and foliage simulation.  The scene cuts back to the inventor and his assistant who are observing the gorilla repeatedly bang its head against the floor, the small girl arrives behind them and walks up to a platform and onto the gorilla's shoulder next to its head. Against the protests of the inventor, who believes that the gorilla is finished and doesn't need improving, the girl taps the gorilla's head and causes the top of the head to pop up on a spring. The girl then makes a top hat appear from thin air and then pulls a white rabbit out of it. The girl blows on the rabbit causing it to dissolve into a stream of golden dust which flows into the hole in the gorilla's head, the top of the head promptly clamps back onto the rest of the head. The gorilla then starts to glow and whites out the screen. When focus is returned, the inventor, assistant and the girl are standing outside on a grass verge, the gorilla then falls onto this verge, however now is completely lifelike with clean movement and fur. The inventor, in an unimpressed voice, remarks "seem it all before" at which the gorilla now under a spotlight and wearing a tuxedo jacket begins to sing in an opera styling causing a deer to shed a tear from the beauty of its singing. After another round of ridicule from the inventor and assistant the gorilla pulls two cymbals from behind its chest and bangs them together like a [[Cymbal-banging monkey toy|cymbal monkey]] causing them to change their minds and congratulate themselves on how well it works, completely ignoring the girl. They then proceed to walk off together discussing their next animal design while the gorilla walks off with the girl.

X-Men (film)
  In [[Nazi-occupied Poland]], 12-year-old [[Magneto (comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]] is separated from his parents upon entering the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. While trying to reach them, he causes a set of metal gates to bend towards him as the result of his mutant ability to create [[magnetic fields]] and control metal manifesting, only to be knocked out by the [[SS-Totenkopfverbände|guards]]. In the not too distant future, [[U.S. Senator]] [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]] attempts to pass a "[[Registration acts (comics)|Mutant Registration Act]]" in [[United States Congress|Congress]], which would force mutants to publicly reveal their identities and abilities. Present are Lehnsherr, now going by the name "Magneto", and his [[telepathic]] colleague [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]]. Seeing Lehnsherr in attendance, Xavier becomes concerned with how he will respond to the Registration Act.  Meanwhile, in [[Meridian, Mississippi]], 17-year-old [[Rogue (comics)|Marie D'Ancanto]] accidentally puts her boyfriend into a [[coma]] upon kissing him as the result of her mutant ability to absorb the powers and life force of others. She runs away from home and adopts the name Rogue. In [[Alberta]], she meets Logan, also known as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], who possesses superhuman healing abilities and metal "claws" that protrude from between his knuckles. While on the road together, they are attacked by a minion of Magneto's, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], until two of Xavier's students [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] arrive and save them. Wolverine and Rogue are brought to [[X-Mansion|Xavier's mansion]] and school for mutants in [[Westchester County, New York]]. Xavier tells Logan that Magneto appears to have taken an interest in Wolverine and asks him to stay while Xavier's mutants, the X-Men, investigate the matter. Meanwhile, Rogue enrolls in the school.  Senator Kelly is abducted by two more of Magneto's minions, [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and is brought to their hideout on the uncharted island of [[Genosha]]. There, Magneto uses Kelly as a [[Human subject research|test subject]] for a machine powered by his magnetic abilities that generates a field of [[radiation]], inducing mutation in normal humans. Kelly later escapes by taking advantage of his newfound mutation. When Rogue uses her power on Wolverine after he accidentally stabs her in view of her classmates, she is convinced by Mystique, who disguises herself as Rogue's crush [[Iceman (comics)|Bobby Drake]], that Xavier is angry with her and she should leave the school. Xavier uses his mutant-locating machine [[Cerebro]] to find Rogue at a train station, and the X-Men go to retrieve her. Meanwhile, Mystique enters Cerebro and sabotages it.  Having left ahead of Storm and Cyclops, Wolverine finds Rogue on a train and convinces her to return to the school. Before they can leave, however, Magneto arrives and reveals that he is after Rogue rather than Wolverine. Although Xavier attempts to stop Magneto by mentally controlling Sabretooth, he is forced to release his hold on Sabretooth when Magneto threatens the police who have converged on the train station, allowing Magneto's Brotherhood to escape with Rogue. Kelly arrives at Xavier's school, and Xavier reads his mind to learn about Magneto's machine. Realizing the strain of powering it nearly killed Magneto, the group deduces he intends to transfer his powers to Rogue and use her to power it at the cost of her life. Kelly's body rejects his mutation, and his body dissolves into liquid. Xavier attempts to locate Rogue using Cerebro, but Mystique's sabotage incapacitates him, and he falls into a [[coma]]. Fellow [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]]/[[Telepathy|telepath]] [[Jean Grey]] fixes Cerebro and uses it, learning that Magneto plans to place his mutation-inducing machine on [[Liberty Island]] and use it to "mutate" the world leaders meeting at a summit on nearby [[Ellis Island]]. The X-Men scale the [[Statue of Liberty]], battling the Brotherhood while Magneto transfers his powers to Rogue and activates the mutating machine. As Wolverine confronts and distracts Magneto, Cyclops blasts him away, allowing Wolverine to destroy the machine. He transfers his powers to Rogue and his healing abilities rejuvenate her, while incapacitating himself.  Professor Xavier and Wolverine recover from their comas. The group also learn that Mystique escaped the island battle and is impersonating Senator Kelly. Xavier gives Wolverine a lead to his past at an abandoned military installation in Canada. Magneto is imprisoned in a complex constructed of plastic and is visited by Xavier, and Magneto warns him he intends to escape one day and continue the fight.  
The Yards
 Leo Handler ([[Mark Wahlberg]]) rides the subway to his mother's house in [[Queens, New York]], where she throws a surprise party in honor of his parole. His cousin Erica ([[Charlize Theron]]) is at the party with her boyfriend Willie Gutierrez ([[Joaquin Phoenix]]). Willie takes Leo aside and thanks him for serving time in prison, implying that Leo had taken a fall for their gang of friends.  Leo is eager to find a job to support his mother ([[Ellen Burstyn]]), who has a heart condition. Willie suggests working for Erica's stepfather Frank Olchin ([[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]]).   The next day, at the railway car repair company Frank owns, Leo is encouraged to enter a 2-year machinist program and Frank offers to help finance his studies. Needing to work right away, Leo asks about working with Willie for the company but Frank discourages that idea. Leo is advised by Willie not to worry about it, saying Frank tried to get him into a machinist program as well.  At [[Brooklyn Borough Hall]], Willie explains how corrupt the contract system is for repair work on the subway. After a hearing to award contracts, Willie is approached by Hector Gallardo ([[Robert Montano]]) about leaving Frank's firm for his. Willie brushes him off, taking Leo with him to [[Roosevelt Island]], where he bribes an official in charge of awarding contracts.   One night, Willie takes Leo to a rail yard, where he and a gang sabotage the work of Gallardo's firm in order to lower their quality rating and lessen their ability to get contracts. Leo is told to stand watch while the crew sabotages the train couplings. Willie heads into the yard master's office to pay him off with [[Knicks]] tickets, but is told to get his crew off the tracks, Gallardo having brought him $2,000 in cash. The yard master sounds the alarm, which draws a police officer. Terrified of returning to jail, Leo tries to run. When the cop begins to hit Leo with his night stick, Leo beats him into unconsciousness. As he runs off, he sees Willie kill the yard master.   With the cop in a coma at a hospital, the crew tells Leo that he must murder the officer to prevent him from identifying Leo when he wakes up. If the cop lives, Leo's the one who will be killed. Leo flees. When the cop awakes, he identifies Leo as his attacker, triggering a broad manhunt. The police assume Leo is also responsible for the yard master's murder. When they raid his mother's apartment, she has a heart attack, leaving her in an even weaker state.   Even though Willie has told him to lay low, Leo emerges from hiding to visit his sick mother. Erica is tending to her. She finds out Willie was with him at the yards and realizes it was Willie who actually killed the yard master. She breaks off their engagement.  Erica implores Frank to help, but instead Leo realizes that Frank is prepared to kill him. Out of options, Leo turns to Gallardo for protection. With Gallardo's lawyers at his side, Leo turns himself in at a public hearing into the rail yard incident and contract corruption. Realizing that the injured cop's testimony against Leo is in no one's interest, Frank and Gallardo negotiate a new split of the contracts with the Queens Borough President ([[Steve Lawrence]]) in a backroom deal.   Frank disowns Willie, who tries unsuccessfully to accept a deal offered to him earlier by Gallardo for protection, which Leo had already accepted. Willie goes to see Erica, trying to win her back. Frank has told him that Erica and Leo had been in love when they were younger, and once were caught having sex. Fearful of his temper and jealousy, Erica triggers the silent house alarm. Willie tries to embrace her, but as she pulls away, he accidentally throws Erica off the second floor landing, causing her to fall to her death. Outside the house, he surrenders to the police, who have responded to the alarm.  Police enter the hearing to inform Erica's mother Kitty ([[Faye Dunaway]]) and Frank of the incident at the house, and the discovery of Erica's body.  After Erica's funeral, Frank takes Leo aside to promise help in the future. Leo turns away in disgust and joins the grieving Kitty and the rest of the family in an embrace of support. Leo then leaves Queens on the elevated train.  (Note: A non-director's cut of the film ended with Leo testifying against Frank and his company, rejecting the deal. The version currently available on the Miramax DVD in the US is the director's cut.)

Yellow Asphalt
 ===Black spot=== A Bedouin boy is run over by an Israeli [[tank truck|tanker]] while crossing the highway with his donkey. The truck driver and his help decide to move the body to the side of the road, and flee. The truck's [[self ignition]] fails, and by the time they repair it, they are surrounded by Bedouins. The tense, almost wordless stand-off is broken when the truck help, under orders from the truck driver, removes an extra wheel from the truck and gives it to the Bedouins to pass judgment on.  ===Here is not there=== A council of village elders meet to discuss the marital problems of a Bedouin man and his German wife. The wife, who wants to leave with her two children back to [[Germany]], is instructed to go back to her tent and her family. She decides to escape in the middle of the night with her two children. She runs most of the night - carrying her younger child, and leading her older one - before falling asleep exhausted. She is discovered in the morning by her husband who pursues her with a [[4WD]] across the desert [[wadi]]s. She intercepts an Israeli truck, and is helped by the truck driver, but her husband realizes she is hiding in the truck when he overhears his children crying inside it. The wife takes flight with the children, but is ultimately pursued down by the husband and [[stoning|stoned]].  This entire episode turns out to be a cautionary daydream of the German wife in question, who ultimately decides to leave in the middle of the night with her two children anyway.  ===Red roofs=== A Palestinian housekeeper, wife of a Bedouin leader, is a concubine of an Israeli Jewish farmer with wife and children of his own. When news of her infidelity reaches her husband via Bedouin children who spotted her making love in the desert, he beats her up. The housekeeper decides to seek shelter at the farmer's place based on his assurances that he would look after her. However, the farmer decides to avoid trouble with the Bedouin tribe and asks his Bedouin farmyard help to kill the woman and dispose of the body and gun. The help is unable to kill her, and takes the housekeeper to an unspecified Israeli city - letting her go and telling her not to come back. She does come back, and is shot dead by the farmer. The help deposes of the body and gun inefficiently, leading to the discovery of both. A [[blood feud]] is thus inadvertently started between the family of the housekeeper and that of the farmyard help. The help ultimately undergoes the primeval "[[Bisha'a|fire test]]" to prove his innocence, but tells the Bedouin elders about the guilt of the Israeli farmer. The Bedouin help is [[takfir|excommunicated]] from his clan, but given a chance to redeem himself by killing the Israeli farmer. He fails to do so, and the Israeli farmer is shown being pursued by the brother of the housekeeper. The final scene shows the farmyard help, an outcast from his society, hitching a ride into the same Israeli city, with words he had used to chide the housekeeper about living in two disparate worlds playing in the background.
