3 Ninjas Kick Back
 Rocky, Colt and Tum-Tum are experiencing the pains of growing up prior to a trip to [[Japan]] planned with their grandfather Mori Shintaro, who hopes to take them to a martial arts tournament of which he was the victor 50 years ago. Only Tum-Tum seems interested in going, and even then, only out of interest in seeing [[Rikishi|sumo wrestler]]s due to how much food they get to eat. He tells the boys he hopes to return a [[dagger]] awarded to him at the tournament when he defeated a boy named Koga, so that it may be presented to the incumbent victor. In Japan, a man (later revealed to be Koga) breaks into a museum and steals a sword before escaping via [[hang glider]]. Meanwhile, back at Mori's house, a trio of burglars led by Koga's nephew Glam try to break into the house to steal the dagger. The boys manage to drive them off, counting it as an ordinary robbery attempt.  At a baseball game, Rocky seems too focused on a cute girl named Lisa D. Marino to pitch properly. Tum-Tum causes constant breaks due to getting snacks, and Colt's short temper causes a fight with the opposing team that grows so large that the [[umpire]] calls off the game until the next week, driving a nail into the boys' plans to travel. Grandpa leaves alone, but the boys' father Sam accidentally gives him Tum-Tum's suitcase by mistake. Once he arrives in Japan, Mori's taxi is [[Traffic collision|rear-ended]] by Glam and his friends who steal his bag. After hearing from Mori at the hospital, the boys discover their bags had been switched and have the dagger. They arrange a trip with Mori's credit card and meet him in Japan. He instructs the boys to give it to the master of the tournament. Glam and his friends record the conversation and deliver it to Koga, who punishes them for not retrieving the dagger. At the tournament, Colt takes the place of a fallen competitor but is promptly beaten by a girl named Miyo, wounding his pride. She helps them deliver the dagger to the Grand Master, and allows the boys to stay with her and her mother. She has a love of baseball but is not very good. The boys offer to train her in baseball if she teaches them some of her martial arts skill.  Koga attempts to trap the boys and retrieve the dagger himself by pretending to be the Grand Master, but the boys and Miyo catch onto his scheme. They face several adversaries before they are finally captured. Meanwhile, Mori is kidnapped from the hospital by Koga's assistant after fleeing Glam and the others. Koga forces Mori to tell him the location of the Cave of Gold; an [[urban legend]] which the sword and dagger are the keys to open. Fearing the safety for his grandchildren, Mori agrees to aid Koga. Soon after, the children come up with a plan and escape Koga's compound on hang gliders, arriving at the cave shortly after the adults. Inside, Koga and Mori realize the legend is true after they encounter walls and monuments of gold within.  While the two battle each other, the boys and Miyo drop in on them and Koga pulls a gun. Using Mori's lesson on focus, Colt throws a [[ball bearing]] into the muzzle of the gun, causing it to backfire and start a [[cave in]]. The group flees the cave, and Koga, now realizing the price of his greed, apologizes and leaves the group unharmed. Rocky realizes that they are a day ahead of America and that they can still make it home by the championship game.  At the game, the boys overcome their flaws. Down by two in the last inning, one of the opposing team antagonists gets a hit off Rocky's pitch which is almost a home run, until a recent roster add, revealed to be Miyo, catches the ball. In the bottom of the inning, Colt focuses and hits a home run, allowing all three boys to score and win the game. The bullies face them down after the game, and he picks Miyo to assault for ruining his home run. Despite Tum-Tum's warning that "she's just a girl", he screams as she readies to attack him and the screen goes dark as he is beaten up soundly.  
8 Seconds
 While growing up in [[Oklahoma]], young [[Lane Frost]] ([[Cameron Finley]]) learns the tricks of the [[bull riding]] trade at the hand of his father, Clyde ([[James Rebhorn]]), an accomplished rodeo bronco rider himself. As he enters his teenage and early adult years, Lane ([[Luke Perry]]) travels the western rodeo circuit with his best friends [[Tuff Hedeman]] ([[Stephen Baldwin]]) and [[Cody Lambert]] (Red Mitchell). He meets and falls in love with a young [[barrel racer]], Kellie Kyle, and they eventually marry in 1984.  As Lane's legend and fame increase, so does the amount of pressure he puts on himself, to be what everyone wants him to be, and he wants to show that he is as good as they say he is. His ascent to the world championship is marred by a cheating incident, questions about Kellie's devotion, and a near broken neck. The film also follows him through the true life series between himself and Red Rock, a bull that no cowboy had ever been able to stay on for 8 seconds. It cuts the series down to three rides. In 1989, he is the second-to-last rider at the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo. While riding on the bull known as "Takin' Care Of Business", he dismounts after his 8-second ride but the bull turns back and hits him in the side with his horn, breaking some ribs and severing a main artery. As a result of excessive internal bleeding, he dies on the arena floor before he can be transported to the hospital.  The final scene shows Hedeman later that same year at the [[National Finals Rodeo]] riding for the world championship. After the 8 second bell sounds, he continues to ride and stays on an additional 8 seconds as a tribute to his fallen best friend.

47 Ronin (1994 film)
 The story of the forty-seven [[rōnin]] has been depicted in many ways, with each version focusing the emphasis on different parts of the story—the rivalry of Lords Asano and Kira, Asano's assault on Kira, Asano's sentence of [[seppuku]] immediately afterward, and the revenge attack 21 months later against Kira by the forty-seven loyal retainers. Oishi Kuranosuke, Asano's [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] and the head of the 47 [[samurai]], is often the primary character, and his actions are often held up as the epitome of [[bushido]], the honor code of the samurai.  In this telling, the emphasis is on the preparation for and the attack on Kira's castle. The immediate reactions to Lord Asano's assault on Lord Kira are shown in flashback, and Lord Asano and the actual assault are barely shown at all.  Unlike other versions of the story, Oishi Kuranosuke does not pretend to descend into a life of debauchery, and Kira is shown as expecting the attack.

When Naren asks Raghuvir for Rajjo's hand in marriage, Raghuvir becomes livid. Naren declares that he is willing to sacrifice everything for Rajjo, and convinces Raghuvir of his love for her. Pathak relents and tells Naren to talk to his father. When Naren does so, Hari Singh is angry that his son has chosen Rajjo, the daughter of a revolutionary, but pretends that he will do anything for Naren's happiness.

Soon, police barge into Pathak's hideaway and try to kill him, only to find him waiting to light a bomb. He kills them all, dying with them. Rajjo, who was out at that time, realizes what has happened and runs away. She is taken into refuge by Shubhankar ([[Jackie Shroff]]), a compatriot of Pathak who has learned of his death. Under Shubhankar's tutelage, Rajjo follows her father's revolutionary path. Meanwhile, Naren is angry with his father for being used as a pawn in the ambush and killing of Pathak and driving Rajjo away. Promising to make up with Rajjo and help her cause, he pledges to become a protester or a revolutionary, opposing his own father.  Naren severs all ties with his father and stands up against British rule, in particular General Douglas, in front of the city. He is convicted and sentenced to hang for attempted murder. Moved by Naren's actions, Rajjo tells Shubhankar about him. Shubhankar saves Naren from being hanged and the two finish off Hari Singh and many of the British loyalists. They are helped by Major Bisht ([[Danny Dengzongpa]]), who has a change of heart after having tragically witnessed the killing of his daughter Chanda, a revolutionary, by the gunshots of British loyalists upon General Douglas' orders. With the loyalists dead, Shubhankar hangs General Douglas by the same noose that was intended for Naren. Shubhankar, Rajjo and Naren, together with Major Bisht and the citizens are shown at the end of the movie saluting the Indian flag, being hoisted by Shubhankar.

Ace Ventura: Pet Detective
 [[Ace Ventura]] is an eccentric, and very unorthodox, [[Miami]]-based [[private detective]] who specializes in retrieving tame or captive animals. However, he struggles to pay his rent, and is often mocked by the [[Miami Police Department]], led by Lieutenant Lois Einhorn, who finds Ventura insufferable. Two weeks before the [[Miami Dolphins]] are to play in the [[Super Bowl]], their [[Mascot#Sports mascots|mascot]], a [[bottlenose dolphin]] named Snowflake, is kidnapped. Melissa Robinson, the Dolphins’ chief publicist, hires Ventura to find Snowflake.  Searching Snowflake’s [[Fish tank|tank]] for clues, Ventura finds a rare triangular-cut, orange [[amber]] stone, which he recognizes as a part of a [[1984–85 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship: Miami Dolphins 45.2C Pittsburgh Steelers 28|1984 AFC Championship]] ring. Ace suspects a billionaire, Ronald Camp, may have stolen Snowflake. Ventura and Melissa sneak in to Camp’s party, Ventura mistakes a [[shark]] for Snowflake and is nearly eaten. Camp apologises, shaking Ventura’s hand, with his hand wearing a ring with an amber stone identical to the one Ventura found. Ruling out Camp, Ventura concludes that a member of the 1984 Miami Dolphins line-up may have kidnapped Snowflake, and will be able to identify the culprit by their rings. However, he discovers all of the team members’ rings are intact.  Roger Podacter, the team’s head of operations, mysteriously dies after falling from his apartment balcony. Einhorn declares it a [[suicide]], but Ventura proves it to have been murder. Ventura comes across an old photograph of the football team, discovering an unfamiliar player named Ray Finkle, who was only added in during midseason. Finkle missed the field goal kick at the end of [[Super Bowl XVII]], which cost the Dolphins the championship, ruining his career.  Visiting Finkle’s parents, Ventura learns that Finkle fully blames [[Dan Marino]] for the end of his career, and was subsequently committed to a mental hospital for homicidal tendencies. Marino is kidnapped himself shortly after. Ventura visits Einhorn, pitching his theory that Finkle kidnapped both Marino and Snowflake in an act of revenge, since the dolphin has been given Finkle's old team number and a goal trick to boot. He also theorises that Finkle murdered Podacter. Einhorn compliments Ventura and kisses him.  Ventura and Melissa go to the mental hospital, the former posing as a potential patient, where he uncovers a newspaper article in Finkle’s possessions about a missing [[hiker]] named Lois Einhorn. Ventura realises that Einhorn is in fact Finkle: Finkle used the fact that the actual Einhorn was missing and presumed dead (with no body found), and took on her identity, had surgery to [[sex reassignment surgery|change his gender]], and began a career with the Miami Police Department to eventually get revenge on Marino and the Dolphins. On [[Super Bowl Sunday]], Ventura follows Einhorn to an abandoned [[yacht]] storage facility where she has Marino and Snowflake held hostage. Einhorn calls the police, framing Ventura for the kidnappings. Melissa and Ventura’s friend, police officer Emilio, stage a hostage situation to get the police to listen to Ventura.  Ventura strips Einhorn of his clothes to expose his failure to completely change her sex, but fails until Marino points out a bulge in the back of his underwear, actually Finkle’s unchanged privates hidden out of view. This confirms that Finkle murdered Podacter after the latter had discovered Finkle’s secret. Einhorn is arrested by the police after attacking Ventura, and Finkle’s ring is identified to have a missing stone. Marino and Snowflake are welcomed back during half-time at the Super Bowl in a match between the Dolphins and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Ventura tries to retrieve a valuable [[albino]] [[pigeon]], but it is scared off by the Eagles’ mascot [[Swoop (Philadelphia Eagles)|Swoop]], causing Ventura to attack him in retaliation.

Continuing their journey, Adam is almost mutilated by a homophobic gang before he is saved by Bob and Bernadette. Adam is shaken and Bernadette comforts him, allowing them to reach an understanding. Likewise, the others come to terms with the secret of Tick's marriage and resolve their differences. Together, they fulfill a long-held dream of Adam's, which, in the original plan, is to climb [[Kings Canyon (Northern Territory)|King's Canyon]] in full drag regalia.  Upon arrival at the hotel, it is revealed that Tick and Marion also have an eight-year-old son, Benjamin, whom Tick has not seen for many years. Tick is nervous about exposing his son to his drag profession and anxious about revealing his homosexuality, though he is surprised to discover that Benjamin already knows and is fully supportive of his father's sexuality and career. By the time their contract at the resort is over, Tick and Adam head back to Sydney, taking Benjamin back with them, so that Tick can get to know his son. However, Bernadette decides to remain at the resort for a while with Bob, who has decided to work at the hotel after the two of them had become close.

Against the Wall (1994 film)
 The [[docudrama]] is a partially fictionalized account of the four-day [[Attica Prison riot]] in 1971 at the [[Attica Correctional Facility]], where prisoners took over much of state prison to protest [[inhumane]] conditions.<ref name="nyt-oconnor"/><ref name="nymag-Leonard"/><ref name="chtri-Randle"></ref><ref name="dn-Attica40"></ref> The movie is focused on [[rookie]] prison guard Michael Smith (Kyle Maclachlan) and inmate Jamaal X (Samuel L. Jackson) who develop a wary friendship with each other. It is largely told through Smith, who was shot four times, and based on Smith's testimony.<ref name="nyt-oconnor"/><ref name="vibe-Mukherjee"></ref>  Jamaal X is based on several inmates, including the inmate Smith credits with saving his life.<ref name="nyt-oconnor"/> [[Clarence Williams III]] plays the inmate Chaka, one of the more ruthless prisoners who does not participate in the riot for honorable reasons.<ref name="nyt-oconnor"/><ref name="chtri-Randle" />  The film opens with a montage of news footage from the late 1960s and early 1970s, including the [[assassination of Robert Kennedy]], students killed at the [[Kent State shootings]] and the [[Watts riots]]. The movie then shows the quiet streets of [[Attica, New York]] and a 22 year old Smith in a barber shop getting his long hair cut. Smith is an expectant father who decided to become a corrections officer because of the pay. After the hair cut, he goes to start his new job at the prison where black [[militant]] Jamaal X also arrives. The film shows the first day of the two men, cross-cutting between them. The terrible prison conditions are revealed. Prison guards treat the prisoners abusively, with violence and needless strip searches, and basic needs like functioning toilets are ignored. The spirit of the [[Vietnam war protests]] is influencing the prisoners to seek recognition of their human rights.  Smith begins hearing of complaints of degrading conditions from increasingly politicized prisoners, particularly Jamaal X, a Muslim leader prominent in the fight for prisoner rights.<ref name="nyt-oconnor"/><ref name="chtri-Randle"/> Smith is portrayed as the only guard who treats the inmates with respect and his occasional signs of sympathy for the prisoners make his co-workers suspicious of him. The seasoned prison guards, like [[Lieutenant]] Weisbad, do not allow challenges to their methods of complete, and often humiliating, control. Ultimately Smith's alliance with Jamaal saves his life.<ref name="chtri-Randle" />  Initially Smith allows himself to [[dehumanize]] the prisoners, cooperating with the inhumane treatment of the prisoners as he obeys the orders of his supervisors, even if it goes against his morals. His wife Sharon ([[Anne Heche]]) expresses disappointment and contempt when she tells him "You're changing!" However, Smith loses the willingness to follow orders during the uprising, after he is beaten by prisoners in the metal shop he supervises. Several prisoners led by the [[psychopath]] Chaka were able to overwhelm the guards and take them hostage when a gate malfunctions. Jamaal protects the guards from Chaka and the other [[sadistic personality disorder|sadists]], recognizing they will lose the ability to negotiate with government officials if the hostages are killed.  Smith refuses to humiliate himself in exchange for basic needs unlike the other captured officers. He tells his puzzled co-workers, "I wasn't a guard long enough to learn how to be a prisoner."<ref name="nyt-oconnor"/> Jamaal comes to respect Smith for his non-[[conformity]] and considers him to be a kindred spirit. Jamaal recruits Smith to speak to a news crew, to testify that the hostages have not been tortured or killed. As the news conference, Smith hints to Jamaal that he cares more about his own [[dignity]] than the approval of others, an attitude he did not show prior to the crisis. However, New York's governor ends negotiations on the fifth day of the uprising and orders a raid by law enforcement officials and soldiers. Inmates and their hostages are fired at indiscriminately as their vision is impaired by [[tear gas]]. Chaka and Lt. Weisbad are among those killed. Smith is shot several times in the stomach by a friend who is an Attica police constable. Jamaal is wounded by a stray bullet.   The statistics in film's [[epilogue]] convey its importance to the present.<ref name="chtri-Randle"/> The [[Incarceration in the United States|U.S. prison population]] had risen 300 percent since the uprising, surpassing [[South Africa]] as the biggest [[per capita]] in the world, and this was likely to worsen with the [[three strikes law]].<ref name="nyt-oconnor"/><ref name="chtri-Randle"/> Forty states were currently cited by the courts for [[overcrowding]] or other inhumane conditions.<ref name="chtri-Randle"/>  
Airheads
 Chazz, Rex and Pip are in a Los Angeles metal band called The Lone Rangers who are continuously turned down as they try to get their demo tape heard by producers. After scolding him for being lazy, Chazz's girlfriend Kayla kicks him out of her apartment. They decide to try to get the local rock station KPPX to play their reel-to-reel tape on the air and attempt to break-in through the back door. After several unsuccessful attempts, a station employee comes out to smoke and they keep the door from shutting behind her.  Once inside, laid back DJ Ian "The Shark" begins talking with them on the air. Station Manager Milo overhears them and intervenes but Ian continues broadcasting. After Milo insults Rex, by calling him "Hollywood Boulevard trash," he and Chazz pull out realistic-looking water pistols and demand airplay. After setting up an old [[reel-to-reel]] for the demo, the tape begins to play but is quickly destroyed when the player malfunctions. The guys try to run but Doug Beech, the station's accountant, had already called the police and they see the building is surrounded.  They negotiate with the police who are now tasked to find Kayla who has a cassette of the demo. Since the station never went off the air, news of the hostage crisis travels quickly and numerous hard rock/metal fans begin showing up outside the radio station interfering with police. A SWAT team has also arrived whose leader prefers using force over negotiation tactics. His team secretly passes a gun through a roof vent to Beech who has been hiding in the air ducts. During the crisis, it is revealed that Milo had secretly signed a deal to change KPPX's format to [[Adult Contemporary]], which includes having to fire Ian and most of the other employees. When this comes out, Ian and a few employees side with the band and turn against Milo.  The police find Kayla who arrives at the radio station to deliver the tape. However, the tape is damaged because she threw it out of the car earlier. Chazz and Kayla get into an argument that quickly escalates and results in the studio console being destroyed, dashing any hopes to play the tape on the air.  As some of the items the band demanded from police are brought into the station, the door shuts on Rex's plastic gun revealing it to be fake. Seeing this, some of the hostages run out; one telling the SWAT team the band's guns aren't real. As the team assembles to storm the station, Beech corners the band from a low hanging air vent. Ian, knowing he no longer will have a job at the station, knocks down Beech's gun. This causes the weapon to wildly fire several rounds and the police are forced to back off. Ian picks up the gun but gives it to a somewhat confused Chazz in a final act of anti-establishment rebellion.  Jimmie Wing, a self-serving record executive who had previously turned Chazz down, comes to the radio station and offers the band a contract. They reluctantly agree to the deal knowing they have no more options. Wing arranges an entire stage and sound system to be airlifted to the roof where the band will play their song for the now huge crowd outside. To the band's dismay, they find only the PA is real and everything else is just props. Refusing to [[lip sync]] as their tape is played, they instead destroy their instruments in protest to the delight of the crowd and [[stage dive]] into the hands of the cheering audience.  The Lone Rangers are next seen playing a gig inside the prison where they are incarcerated.  The concert is being shown live on [[MTV]]. Ian, now their manager, says on the phone the band will start touring in six months, or "three months if they behave themselves."  Their album ''LIVE IN PRISON'' goes [[Music recording sales certification#Certification thresholds|triple platinum]].

He chases her into a barn and attempts to rape her, but Shivani instead overpowers him and subsequently sets the barn on fire leaving Singh to die. She then searches for Vijay, where she comes to know that he has moved to Tikamgarh. She then goes to work at a hospital for the mentally ill and finds Vijay, who had become paralyzed in the car accident after running over Shivani's family. She volunteers to look after him and rehabilitate him. When cured, Vijay begs Shivani to say she loves him. She opens her arms to him. During their embrace, she stabs him and then starts attacking him for everything he did. She confesses that she made him better for one purpose: to kill him. She says it's a sin to kill a handicapped person, who cannot defend himself. Eventually, they both dangle from a cliff (with Vijay holding onto Shivanis foot). Vijay says that if he falls to his death he'll take Shivani with him. Deciding that it is more important for Vijay to die than for her to live, Shivani lets go of the ledge causing both of them to fall off the cliff to their deaths.  
Angels in the Outfield (1994 film)
 Young foster child Roger ([[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]) and his friend J.P. (Milton Davis, Jr.) love to sneak into baseball games of the hopelessly dreadful [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]].  Still in limited contact with his widower father, Roger asks when they will be a family again. His father replies sarcastically, "I'd say when the Angels win the pennant." Taking his father's words literally, Roger prays for God to help the Angels win. After he prays, a star, unseen by Roger, twinkles in the sky.  Then, in a game against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] which Roger and J.P. attend, he sees a group of [[angels]] led by Al ([[Christopher Lloyd]]) helping the team. Although Roger can see them quite clearly, everyone else can only explain the seemingly impossible acts as freak occurrences.  Roger's unique ability to see which players are receiving help from angels leads their skeptical manager, George Knox ([[Danny Glover]]) to keep him around as a [[good luck charm]] and consultant, including ending the use of profanity as a nod to the original film. Due to the much needed help, the Angels start to win games and make a surprising second-half surge to the top of their [[division (sport)|division]]. Meanwhile, Roger's father permanently gives up [[child custody|custody]] of his son, believing it's in Roger's best interest.  As Roger laments his loss, J.P. accidentally reveals to antagonistic sports broadcaster Ranch Wilder ([[Jay O. Sanders]]) that Roger has the ability to see angels, and that George has been winning through the advice Roger's given him. Hoping to destroy George due to a longtime rivalry between the two, Ranch informs the press of this and their owner Hank Murphy ([[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]]) threatens to relieve George of his management responsibilities. Roger comes clean to his caretaker Maggie Nelson ([[Brenda Fricker]]) about his special ability and at a press conference they and the entire team defend George in front of the press. Moved by their faith, Murphy allows George to remain as manager of the Angels.  During the championship game none of the angels show up to help the team. Later on, Al explains that championships must be played without help from the angels and that he was there just checking on pitcher Mel Clark ([[Tony Danza]]) who will be one of them soon as he has been a chain smoker. Mel starts struggling, and is getting tired after throwing 159 pitches. When George goes out to the mound, everyone thinks he's going in to take Mel out, but instead, George gives him some motivation, and with encouragement from Roger, the team, and finally, the entire stadium audience as well as owner Murphy and the broadcasters (with the exception of Ranch).  The Angels ultimately win the final game of the regular season without the help of the angels and clinch the division pennant over the rival [[Chicago White Sox]], thanks to Mel. Murphy fires Ranch due to his denigration of the team. The film ends with George adopting both Roger and J.P. as he wants to try be a father. J.P. sees Al at the window and says "I knew it could happen." Al circles around the house and says "We're always watching" and flying off into the stars, which re-enact a baseball game.  
Andre (film)
  In 1962 a seal drowns in a fishing net cast by financially struggling fisherman, Billy Baker ([[Keith Szarabajka]]) - much to his fury.  He and the other local fishermen discuss shooting the seals as a way to improve their flagging fishing season.  Toni Whitney ([[Tina Majorino]]), a seven-year-old girl, and her [[Rockport, Maine]] family subsequently adopt the seal's orphaned newborn pup (played by a [[sea lion]] named Tory), naming it Andre.  The vet doesn't hold out much hope, but Toni incites him to survive, with the promise that she will be his best friend forever, and that she will always take care of him.  After several failed attempts to get him to take a bottle - with both warm and cold milk - Toni's father, Harry ([[Keith Carradine]]), the harbor master, constructs an "artificial mother" for him out of wetsuit material, a bucket, and two feeding bottles, which he finally accepts, ensuring his survival.  As Andre grows up, Toni forms an inseparable bond with him, even taking him to school for show and tell, with the help of Harry and the permission of her teacher, the prim and prickly Mrs. McCann (Shirley Broderick).  He becomes attached to the Whitneys - especially to Toni - living in the harbor, learning tricks, and attracting a huge local following of fans.  The irony of his success as an entertainer further angers Billy, who becomes increasingly jealous of Andre's and the Whitneys' success and esteem within the village.  Relations between Harry and Billy deteriorate rapidly.  Meanwhile, Billy's son, Mark ([[Joshua Jackson]]), and Toni's sister, Paula (Aidan Pendleton), become romantically involved, increasing tension between Paula and Harry over Andre.  Mark and Billy have a strained relationship as it is.  Under pressure from his family and the locals, Harry reluctantly makes the decision to release Andre into the wild once he is weaned, but reconsiders and does not go through with it when he encounters the body of a seal covered in bullet holes at the place where he had planned to release him.  In his first winter, Andre escapes the confines of the barn, and the water home that Harry built for him there when the harbor froze over.  He cuts himself badly - leaving a trail of blood which the Whitneys discover upon realizing that he is missing - and remains gone for the winter.  However he returns in spring, physically weak but unchanged in character, and recovers quickly from his ordeal.  As Andre gets older he continues to be scapegoat for the local fishermen - and for Paula - as he takes up more and more of Harry's time and affections.  He misses her performance (which he told her he would not miss for the world) in the local Miss Liberty beauty pageant, because he has to protect Andre from a drunken Billy, who is trying to kill him with a pitchfork.  Harry's relations with his son, Steve ([[Shane Meier]]), fade into the background as he comes down harshly on him for minor transgressions, and fails to keep up with what is going on in his life.  When Paula and Mark are discovered smoking in the shed when Andre exits it in a fit of coughing, Harry permanently bans Mark's presence on the Whitneys' grounds, and his and Paula's relationship - in part a displacement of the tension between Harry and Billy.  Paula decides she is leaving home, raging that Harry doesn't care about her, and that she hates him - to the anger and deep concern of her mother, Thalice ([[Chelsea Field]]).  Mark tells her he knows a way to make Andre go away so that he'll never come back.  Harry's job also suffers.  He fails to call meetings, never checks moorings, and his relations with the fishermen become ever more strained.  He also attracts the ongoing attention of the federal government, who send their inspector, Jack Adams, to inform him that he is violating the law by keeping a wild animal in captivity, as a pet.  He insists that Andre is there by his own choice, but that it's too dangerous in the wild during winter.  Jack pays two visits to the Whitneys' home, increasingly emphatic that Harry faces court and even jail if he does not give Andre up.  However, Andre is teaching him about the intelligence and abilities of seals, and despite the risks, he is determined that nothing will put an end to this learning curve.  At one point Andre saves his life when he is underwater checking a mooring - which turns out to be entangled in an active explosive.  Eventually, Thalice manages to impress upon Harry the high cost of continuing his relations with Andre in the setup that they have, and he agrees to call Jack, so that he can relocate Andre to the aquarium in Boston, where he will be safe, cared for, and have plenty of people for company.  However, before he can tell Toni, the telephone rings, and she goes down to the harbor.  There she discovers that Paula and Mark have taken Andre, commandeered a boat, and are heading out to sea as dark clouds gather.  Steve is charged with keeping an eye on Toni while their parents investigate, but he is engrossed in a TV program, and does not notice her slip out and launch the dinghy onto an increasingly choppy sea.  In Mark and Paula's boat, he attempts to shoot Andre, reasoning that he is a problem for the fishermen, but she finally realizes that she does care about Andre and doesn't want him to be hurt or killed.  She tries to stop Mark from shooting, but the gun goes off.  Andre jumps overboard, but Paula, not seeing this, assumes his body has fallen in.  Very upset, and very angry at Mark, she demands to be taken home.  Harry and Thalice, having been informed by Toni that Paula and Mark had taken Andre, meet them on the shore, whereupon Steve, in a panic, arrives and tells Thalice that Toni has disappeared, as has the dinghy. She calls the coast guard, as the rain starts to fall, and visibility begins to deteriorate.  Out at sea, Toni is struggling to maintain control of the dinghy in the face of the storm and a strong outward tide-rush.  It's being tossed on huge waves, in opaque rain, and is heading towards some jagged rocks.  She loses both oars, and, panicking, begins to call for help.  Andre, who turns out to be unharmed, swims to her rescue, pulling her away from the rocks by the dinghy's mooring rope.  He then alerts Billy and Harry, in their boat, leading them to Toni's location.  Before she can be rescued, a large wave capsizes the dinghy.  Mark, who came with Billy and Harry, jumps overboard, swims out to her, and Billy throws them both a lifebelt, pulling them to safety.  Billy tells Mark that he is proud of him, while Harry comforts Toni in the back of the boat, and Andre swims away, exultant at her safety.  Once back on shore, Toni is distraught to find Jack levering a caged Andre onto a transport vehicle.  Harry explains to her that Andre is going to live in the aquarium in Boston, where he will be safe and cared for in ways they can't.  Annie Potts, an aquarium worker, tells Toni they will take good care of him, that they will love having him there, and that she will get to visit him whenever she wants.  She reluctantly accepts the notion, and tells Andre that she loves him and will visit him all the time.  As summer comes round, Billy and Mark's relationship improves. Harry repairs relations with his family, and having been offered a research job in marine mammal protection, steps down as harbor master, nominating Billy to take his place.  Toni comes to the realization that Andre would be happier in the wild, being a wild animal, and he is subsequently released.  The Whitneys do not expect to see him again - Toni wonders if he is making new friends with the wild seals, and Paula professes to miss him.  Multiple alleged sightings of Andre are reported, until a friend of the Whitneys spots him nearby, and informs them that he is on his way.  The entire town of Rockport flocks to the harbor to watch him returning home to his family.  The film ends with an adult Toni narrating that his life became legend after he made his first trip home - that he spent every winter at the aquarium, and every spring he was released to swim home to Rockport, where he spent his summers.  She narrates that by the time he was twenty-four years old he could hardly see, but still made his final trip home, and that in all her past and future, she'll never have a better friend than him.

Ashes of Time
  Sets in ancient China, [[Leslie Cheung]] plays a young [[Ouyang Feng]] (the main antagonist in the novel ''[[The Legend of the Condor Heroes]]'') and serves as a common link to the other young characters from the novel and serves as the narrator of the film.      ===Opening===  The story begins many years after the main events that take place later in the film, with [[Ouyang Feng]] – now known as the Western Venom due to his spitefulness and mercilessness, and hailing from the western province – effortlessly toying with and disposing of a group of henchmen in brutal fashion. He narrates that he is venomous because he is enraged with jealousy.   The story then backtracks many years to the times when Feng was younger and before he was known as the Western Venom, working as a broker for assassins in a seemingly remote and desert region. He narrates that he has a friend from the East who visits him every year around this time.  ===Act I – Huang Yaoshi (Eastern Heretic)===  [[Huang Yaoshi]] (Eastern Heretic) kills a band of bandits just to take one of their horses.  He arrives at Feng's and delivers to him a bottle of wine called "Forgotten Love" that he said was presented to him by a close friend.  Huang's friend claims the wine can make a person forget the past and start each day anew, free of past burdens; he proceeds to drink the wine while Feng declines.  That night, Huang begins to lose his memory, hurriedly leaves and chases after a shadowy woman who had awoken him in his sleep. The shadowy woman may be a fragment of his dream or imagination.  Huang arrives at a shallow river filled with trees on both sides.  A woman named Cherry Blossom is standing in the river and tending to her horse. Huang seemingly still retains memory of her, looks smugly at her while she steals glances at him.  Neither one speaks.  In the next scene, Huang is drinking with the Blind Swordsman.  Huang is losing his memory and asks the later how they got to know each other. The Blind Swordsman tells him they used to be best friends but Huang stole the former's wife. As he is leaving, the Blind Swordsman narrates that he would have killed Huang if not for the fact that he is losing his sight and cannot see at night.  Huang is drinking alone at an establishment when an argument is taking place between two patrons, one being Murong Yang. Yang tries to draw his sword when Huang interjects and urges him to calm down. Yang pretends to cool down but quickly unleashes his sword and inadvertently cuts Huang.  Huang retreats outside, leans on a wall, and sees that there is blood coming from his lower abdomen. Inside, Yang is laughing hysterically.  Feng narrates that when Huang is a young man, he is charming and rebellious.  He breaks women's hearts just as easily as they fall in love with him.  ===Act II – Murong Yang / Murong Yin (Dugu Qiubai)===  Despite being an elite swordsman himself, Murong Yang approaches Feng to hire an assassin to kill Huang. Yang claims that Huang breaks his sister's heart and deserves to die.  Later, Yang's sister, Murong Yin arrives at Feng's and attempts to call off her brother's order. She says that her brother is in love with her but she loves Huang, who tells her in return that she is the one he loves the most. Yang and Yin are the same person, a woman who sometimes dresses in man clothing.  In a flashback, one night after rounds of drinking, Huang tells Yang that if the latter has a sister he will marry her. Yang, already infatuated with Huang, tells him he will present his sister to him. Yin goes to the rendezvous, dressed as a woman, but Huang does not show up; it is implied that Huang disappeared after that night of drinking. The event sends Yin into a rage and she seeks to have Huang killed, although she goes back and forth on her decision. She subsequently leaves Feng, still with a broken heart.    Feng narrates that people who have been deeply hurt in love sometimes do very strange things to soothe their wounded hearts, and that no one has seen Yang or Yin since; but shortly after her disappearance, a strange and powerful swordsman named [[Dugu Qiubai]] (who likes to practice her sword play with her own reflection) appears on the stage. The film then shows Dugu Qiubai as Yang and Yin interchangeably.  ===Act III – Blind Swordsman===  The Blind Swordsman approaches Feng asking for a job to help pay for his journey back home to see the cherry blossom.  Feng offers him the job of protecting the villages from the band of bandits seeking revenge for the comrades that Huang killed earlier in the film.  The Girl with a Mule solicits Feng's help in hiring an assassin to exact revenge on a group of imperial guards who killed her younger brother for unknowingly offending one of the guards.  She is a poor peasant who can only offer an old mule and a basket of eggs as payment.  Feng coldly brushes her off saying no one will kill for such a petty sum but he implies she can offer her body as compensation, a suggestion that disgusts her.  Undeterred, she sits outside Feng's front yard hoping to solicit assassins who walk through the gate.  While observing her through his balcony, Feng laments that from this vantage point, she looks like his lost love,   Feng notes that The Blind Swordsman has a very orderly and rigid daily routine, but he knows that even though the later lights a candle at night, he cannot see in the dark.  During the course of fighting the bandits, the weather changes to heavy overcast, the Blind Swordsman is unable to see and is killed in battle.  ===Act IV – Hong Qigong (Northern Beggar)===  Feng comes across an exhausted and dirty young man ([[Hong Qigong]]) who runs out of food and money.  He offers him food, shelter, and a job to work as an assassin. Hong begrudgingly accepts.  Hong's first job is to kill the bandits, who are returning to cause havoc in the area after being impeded and suffering casualties in the battle with the Blind Swordsman.  Hong successfully disposes of the bandits and receives compensation from Feng.  Feng notes that Hong is a man with integrity and will not stay in this profession for long.  Hong's wife appears at Feng's looking for her husband.  Hong angrily ushers her away to return home; instead, his wife stands outside and waits for him. Hong tells Feng that he cannot takes his wife along while he is getting his hands dirty fighting and killing for a living, and notes that every wuxia master he encounters rides alone.  Feng replies that there are always exceptions and tells Hong he once had a woman waiting for him but she ended up marrying his brother in his absence.  Hong accepts the Girl with a Mule's egg and kills the imperial guards to exact revenge for her brother.  In the battle he suffers serious injuries, including losing a finger, and is nursed back to health by his wife.  While Hong is still in critical condition, the Girl with a Mule begs Feng to hire a doctor to tend to Hong.  Feng refuses, saying that a doctor cost money and suggests again that she sells her body to raise money.  A bed ridden Hong urges the Girl with a Mule not to do anything stupid, and says that she doesn't owe him anything since he has accepted her egg as compensation.   Feng berates a bed-ridden Hong and asks him if it is really worth it losing body parts for an egg.  Hong smiles at him and says he is using his wuxia for good instead of greed.  He shoots back that the cold and calculating Feng would never accept such a task and he feels alive for doing a good deed.  Feng leaves Hong's bedside speechless for he knows Hong is right.  After Hong returns to health, he and his wife embarks on their journey together and leaves Feng.  While watching them disappear over the horizon, Feng thinks of his own shattered love life and feels a great sense of jealousy.  Feng notes that Hong purposely heads north against the south-blowing wind.  The caption narrates that Hong later becomes the leader of the Beggars Sect and engages in a fierce battle with Feng.  ===Act V – Ouyang Feng (Western Venom)===  Feng pays a visit to the Blind Swordsman's hometown to see the cherry blossom and is surprised to learn that the place has no cherry blossom.  Cherry Blossom turns out to be the Blind Swordsman's wife, who breaks down crying after she learns from Feng that her husband has been killed in battle.  In a flashback, Feng tracks down his love the day before she is to be married to his brother and offers to take her away with him.  She steadfastly refuses, telling him that he is too late. Feng, not wanting to attend the marriage ceremony, leaves that night and never returns.  Feng receives a note from his family that his true love (now his sister-in-law) had died almost two years ago.  Feng infers that the "Forgotten Love" wine that Huang brings to him early in the film is a gift from her.  In a flashback, Huang and Feng's love are sitting and talking in her beach side hut.  Huang narrates that he is in love with her but she only loves Feng. She sends Huang to visit Feng every year to gather his news for her. Secretly, she hopes that Huang would tell Feng her whereabouts. After Huang tells her he will never tell Feng her location because he promised her not to, she breaks down sobbing.  She laments that she always thought she was the winner in love but she now realizes that she is the loser.  Huang narrates that he likes cherry blossom because he gets to see her every year during the season.  She dies of illness soon after their last meeting and on her death bed she gives Huang the "Forgotten Wine" to deliver to Feng.    In the present, Huang has lost a lot of his memory. One of the few things he remembers is that he likes cherry blossom and he proceeds to become a hermit, resides in an island fills with cherry blossom, and acquires the nickname Eastern Heretic.  Feng waits for Huang to visit even though he knows he will not come now that she has died.  After two days, Feng drinks the remaining bottle of the "Forgotten Love".  The wine does not make Feng forget his past but instead makes his memory for his love even stronger.  He narrates that the more a person wants to forget, the more he remembers; and that the wine is her way of making him always remember her.  Feng burns down his dwelling and returns to his hometown. The caption says he later becomes the leader of his clan and acquires the nickname: Western Venom.  ===Ending===  The film ends with brief appearances by the surviving main characters, and references scenes from the novel.  It implies that the henchmen killed by Feng in the beginning of the film belong to the Beggars Sect lead by Hong.  Hong sets a trap to corner Feng, but Feng is unfazed and smiles manically at Hong. Hong and Feng then engage in a battle.  The film then pans to an older Feng in grey beard and hair, fighting and disposing of his enemies.  
Asterix Conquers America
 Upon learning that his army has once again been defeated by the one remaining village in [[Gaul]] that has yet to be conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s, [[Recurring characters in Asterix#Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar]], angry at how embarrassing this makes him appear before Rome's senators, begins thinking up of a new plan to defeat them once and for all. Knowing that the village's strength lies in the magic potion it uses, brewed by [[Recurring characters in Asterix#Getafix|Druid Getafix]], Caesar assigns Lucullus, a loyal patrician, to the task of capturing Getafix and throwing him off the [[Flat earth|edge of the world]], in the hopes of weakening the village.  In Gaul, an accident during another fight over the state of [[Recurring characters in Asterix#Unhygienix|Unhygienix]]'s fish, leaves the village with barely enough magic potion to protect them. Realising he will need to brew more, Getafix sends Asterix and [[Obelix]] out to sea to catch fresh fish, a vital ingredient of the potion, while he and Dogmatix head out into the nearby forest to gather the necessary herbs for it. However, Lucullus takes advantage of the situation, capturing the pair and transporting them to a Roman galley bound for the "world's edge". When Asterix and Obelix spot the galley and the captured druid on it, they quickly go in pursuit, sinking a pirate ship in the process, before losing sight of the Romans when a violent storm blows them off course. However, their hope of rescuing Getafix are restored, when a dolphin appears to guide them back to the Romans, after reuniting them with Dogmatix shortly after he had been dropped overboard by Lucullus. As evening begins to approach, the galley arrives before the [[North America]]n coastline which the Romans mistakenly believe to be the world's edge. Discovering that the Gauls are back on their tail, Lucullus has Getafix launched quickly by catapult towards the coast, and is amused when Asterix and Obelix wreck their boat while making landfall. Returning to Rome with the good news, Caesar quickly begins moving men to Gaul to lay siege to the village, until its remaining magic potion runs out.  Unbeknown to Caesar and Lucullus, Asterix and Obelix find themselves venturing out into North America, whereupon they begin to explore the land for Getafix. However, night soon falls, and the pair decide to make camp until the morning, whereupon Obelix manages to capture some of the indigenous [[wild turkey|turkeys]] (which he refers to as a "gobble-gobble"). The next morning, while Obelix is out of the camp hunting for breakfast, Asterix is captured by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s and taken to their village, where he soon finds himself tied to a pole alongside Getafix and menaced by the Natives and their [[Medicine Man]]. Obelix, whose hunt saw him catching a Native American and mistakenly thinking he is a disguised Roman, quickly learns his friend is missing after finding his discarded helmet, and quickly begins searching for him with Dogmatix's help. During his search, Obelix manages to save Minihooha, the daughter of the Native American's chief, from a stampede of [[bison]], who bring him back to her village just in the nick of time to save his friends from harm. After impressing the chief with his strength by besting his champion, Asterix and Getafix are released and the group are welcomed into the village, much to the annoyance of the Medicine Man, who is further humiliated when Getafix proves to be a superior magician. That night, after a party, the medicine man pretends to offer peace, but instead gives all three hallucinogens in a [[Smoking pipe|pipe]], which knocks them all out.  In the morning, Asterix finds Obelix suffering from [[hallucination]]s after inhaling too much of the drug, along with discovering that Getafix was taken prisoner by the Medicine Man. In the Medicine Man's cave, Getafix refuses to hand over the recipe of the magic potion, before lying about the ingredients used in it. When the Medicine Man painfully discovers the deception, he quickly prepares to punish him, before releasing a [[grizzly bear]] against Asterix, after he had been guided to the cave by Dogmatix. Defeating the bear and its keeper, Asterix returns to the village, where Minihooha helps to cure Obelix of his condition with a huge meal. The natives soon give the group a [[canoe]] to return home, which Obelix paddles tirelessly across the ocean. Returning to Gaul, they quickly find their village devastated, and all but [[Recurring characters in Asterix#Cacofonix|Cacofonix]] gone, the village's bard left tied up. Learning from him that Caesar has captured the villagers and plans to take them back to Rome, Asterix and Obelix — disguised as legionaries — take gourds of fresh potion to their friends imprisoned at the nearby camp of Compendium. Thus empowered, the Gauls free themselves, and begin trashing the camp. While Caesar escapes disguised as a [[wine]] barrel and returns to Rome, Lucullus is consumed alive by Caesar's pet [[Panthera|panther]]. The Gauls, victorious, return to their village and soon listen to Obelix tell them of their adventures as they hold a feast to celebrate.  
Assault at West Point: The Court-Martial of Johnson Whittaker
 Johnson Whittaker, a black cadet at West Point, is attacked by three fellow students. The school administrators court-martial Whittaker in the mistaken belief that he staged his own attack, supposedly to avoid a philosophy exam.  The assault on him by fellow cadets quickly makes its way into the press and gained widespread attention. [[Richard Theodore Greener|Richard Greener]] is the Harvard alumnus [[lawyer]] who defends Whittaker at his trial and, since he is also black, has also personally experienced [[racism]]. Greener's partner, [[Daniel Henry Chamberlain|Daniel Chamberlain]], does not share his determination but rather has a different agenda - acquiring fame.  The trial begins and the two lawyers are at odds with one another. The prosecutor, Major [[Asa Bird Gardiner]], cross-examines Whittaker, who manages to evade his tactics. On the day the verdict is to be delivered, the judge whose vote they had hoped would be favorable does not show up in court. The other two judges find Whittaker guilty of assaulting himself so as not to participate in the exam.  The film closes in later years, with Whittaker being interviewed by a reporter. Whittaker tells him that he went on to become a school principal, while Greener is now retired. He also informs the reporter that Chamberlain later went on to defend [[lynching]]. "People will sometimes do anything to gather fame", states Whittaker, to which the reporter replies, "I wonder what hidden agenda he was carrying". The film ends with the reporter telephoning the newspaper and telling them to hold the first page; he has a great story.

While his uncle (Mohan Natarajan), Duraipandi's father, was a womaniser and was hated by the villagers, his uncle was jealous of Sandanapandian. One day, he behaved badly with school girls so Sandanapandian forced him to beg forgiveness to the girl at the village court. After this humiliation, Duraipandi's father committed suicide.

Bandit Queen
 The film opens in the summer of 1968 at a small village in Uttar Pradesh.<ref>Let us Know Something About It In Detail. The real life Phoolan Devi was born in 1963 and was married when she was about 11. See [[Phoolan Devi]] for more details</ref> Phoolan is married to a twenty-something fellow called Puttilal ([[Aditya Shrivastava]]). Though child marriages are customary during that time, Phoolan's mother Moola (Savitri Raekwar) objects to the timing of the match. Phoolan's aging father Devideen (Ram Charan Nirmalker) conforming to his culture, regrettably disagrees, and Phoolan is sent off with Puttilal.  Phoolan is exposed to some sexual and exploitative abuses, including the [[caste system]]. (Phoolan's family as well as Puttilal's family belong to the lower ranked [[Mallaah|Mallah]] sub caste; the higher ranked Thakur caste takes the lead in social and political situations.) Puttilal is physically and sexually abusive, and Phoolan eventually runs away and returns home. As Phoolan grows older, she faces incidents of (non-consensual) fondling and groping from the [[Rajput|Thakur]] men (whose parents make up the ''panchayat'' or village government). At the next town meeting, the ''panchayat'' wield their patriarchal authority to banish Phoolan from the village, since she will not consent to the sexual advances of the higher caste males, who treat her like sub-human chattel.  Accordingly, Phoolan lives with her cousin Kailash ([[Saurabh Shukla]]). En route to another village, she encounters a troop of [[Dacoity|''daku'']]s (bandits) of the Babu Gujjar gang, led by Vikram Mallah Mastana ([[Nirmal Pandey]]). Phoolan stays with Kailash for a while, but is eventually compelled to leave. Angry and hopeless, Phoolan goes to the local police to try to have her ban lifted, but she is beaten, molested, and arrested by the police, who rape her while in custody. The Thakurs put up bail and have her released. But, unknown to her, the bail is a bribe (paid, through the police, to Babu Gujjar's gang), and Babu Gujjar arrives to collect his prize.  In May 1979, Phoolan is abducted by Babu Gujjar ([[Anirudh Agarwal]]). Gujjar is a physically imposing man and a ruthless, predatory mercenary. Although Gujjar's lieutenant Vikram is sympathetic towards Phoolan, Gujjar indiscriminately brutalizes and humiliates her, until one day Vikram catches him raping her (yet again) and shoots him in the head. Vikram takes over the gang, and his empathy for Phoolan eventually grows into a mutually respectful mature adult relationship. Around this time, Phoolan revisits her former husband Puttilal, and with Vikram's help, abducts him and exacts her justice for his rape and abuse, beating him up. She shares her closure with Vikram.  All goes well until Thakur Shri Ram ([[Govind Namdeo]]) is released from prison. Thakur Shri Ram is the real gang leader (boss of the erstwhile Gujjar). Shri Ram returns to his gang and while Vikram receives him with respect, Shri Ram bristles at Vikram's egalitarian leadership style and covets Phoolan. In August 1980, Shri Ram arranges to have Vikram assassinated, and abducts Phoolan, bringing her to the village of Behmai. Phoolan is repeatedly raped and beaten by Shri Ram and by the rest of the gang members, as punishment for her "disrespect" for his previous advances, and for her audacity at being an equal. The stunning and disturbing final humiliation and punishment is that she is stripped, paraded around Behmai, beaten and sent to fetch water from the well (in full view of the village).  A severely traumatised Phoolan returns to her cousin Kailash. She recovers gradually, and seeks out Man Singh ([[Manoj Bajpai]]), an old friend of Vikram Mallah. Man Singh brings her to another large gang, led by Baba Mustakim ([[Rajesh Vivek]]). She relates her history to Baba and asks him for some men and weapons to form a gang. Baba Mustakim agrees, and Man Singh and Phoolan become the leaders for the new gang.  Phoolan leads her new gang with courage, generosity, humility and shrewdness. Her stockpile and her legend grows. She becomes known as Phoolan Devi, the bandit queen. In February 1981, Baba Mustakim informs her of a large wedding in Behmai, with Thakur Shri Ram in attendance. As Phoolan departs, Baba Mustakim warns her to remain low key. Phoolan attacks the wedding party and her gang exacts revenge from the entire Thakur clan of Behmai. They round up the men and beat them up. Many of the men are finally shot. This act of vengeance brings her to the attention of the national law enforcement authorities (in New Delhi). The top police officials now begin a massive manhunt for Phoolan, and Thakur Shri Ram relishes the opportunity to come to their aid.  The manhunt claims many lives in Phoolan's gang. They are ultimately forced to hide out in the rugged ravines of Chambal without any food or water. Phoolan evaluates her options and decides to surrender. Her terms are to have her remaining mates protected and provided for (the women and children in particular). The film ends with Phoolan's surrender in February 1983. The end credits indicate that all the charges against her were withdrawn (including the charges of murder at Behmai), and that she was released in 1994.  
Bad Girls (1994 film)
 Cody, Anita, Eileen and Lily work together in a brothel. When Anita is abused by a customer, Cody kills the man.  Narrowly escaping from a lynch mob, they are pursued by Pinkerton detectives hired by the widow of the man they'd shot. A man they meet on the road, McCoy, warns them of the pursuit.   They discuss riding to Oregon and starting a new life by taking up a claim to land inherited by Anita when her husband died of cholera. Cody offers to fund their new start from savings she has accumulated over the years. They go to the bank where Cody's savings are held. As she tries to close her account and make a withdrawal, the Pinkerton detectives catch up with her and try to arrest her. Leaving the bank manager's office, they find themselves in the middle of a bank robbery being staged by Kid Jarrett, a former lover of Cody. He helps her escape from arrest but takes her money and tells her to find him.  During the escape, Eileen is arrested. Cody decides to go after the money and Kid Jarrett, telling Anita and Lilly to wait in hiding. Anita and Lilly return to town to break Eileen out of jail.   Cody's meeting with Kid Jarrett and Frank Jarrett does not go well. Kid Jarrett has not forgiven her for running out on him. He flogs her. Later, she is found unconscious by McCoy, who brings her to a healer in town and puts the Pinkerton detectives off her trail.  McCoy, Cody and the other three women meet up on the ranch of a farmer who'd been guarding Eileen's cell (and whom they'd tricked into releasing her). Cody plans revenge on Kid Jarrett. They foil a train robbery and steal his loot, at the cost of Lilly being abducted. In turn, they abduct Frank Jarrett, Kid's father.  Regrouping again on the ranch, Anita leaves the others, frustrated with their revenge-motivated misadventures. She goes to a lawyer in town and finds out that the claim to land is only valid in the hands of her husband - as a woman, she cannot claim the land in Oregon.  Frank Jarrett antagonizes his captors until McCoy shoots him. Cody sends away McCoy. Meanwhile, Lilly is being raped by her captors. McCoy stages a one-man rescue attempt and is captured, but Lilly escapes.  Reunited, Cody, Anita and Eileen go to rescue Lilly and meet her on the road. When she tells them that McCoy has been captured, they continue towards Kid Jarrett's hide out, and offer to trade the stolen loot for McCoy, who has been flogged and tortured. Kid agrees, then shoots McCoy as soon as the loot is handed over. He gives Cody the money he stole from her (although in close up it clearly is mid-20th century currency).  While retreating, one of Lilly's would-be rapists taunts her, triggering a shootout that results in the deaths of Kid's entire gang.  After the shootout, Eileen marries the rancher, while Lilly, Cody and Anita head west to start a new life, mentioning the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] of 1896.  On the trail they overtake the Pinkerton detectives, who do not see them.

Baby's Day Out
 Bennington Austin "Bink" Cotwell IV has adoring parents Laraine ([[Lara Flynn Boyle]]) and Bennington ([[Matthew Glave]]), lives in a huge mansion in a suburb of [[Chicago]], and is just about to appear in the social pages of the newspaper. Three klutzy would-be kidnappers – Edgar "Eddie" Mauser ([[Joe Mantegna]]), Norbert "Norby" LeBlaw ([[Joe Pantoliano]]) and Victor "Veeko" Riley ([[Brian Haley]]) –, the main antagonists, disguise themselves as the photographers from the paper and kidnap him. After the kidnapping, they have difficulty controlling him. In the trial of trying to get him to fall asleep, Norby does so reading Bink's book named "Baby's Day Out", leaving him unattended. Norby later goes to sleep himself. Looking through it, he notices a bird on the page and then by the window. He follows it out and successfully gets away from his kidnappers, with Eddie falling off the building and into a garbage bin.  The FBI arrives at the mansion, headed by Dale Grissom ([[Fred Dalton Thompson]]), where they try to piece together clues along with Bink's parents and his loving nanny Gilbertine ([[Cynthia Nixon]]). Meanwhile, he, now outside on the ground and crawling about, finds another part of his book – the blue bus, which he then boards. The kidnappers realise he is missing and start chasing the bus in their van, but their efforts are in vain. Meanwhile, on the bus, Bink crawls into the bag of an [[obesity|obese]] lady, who gets off at her stop shortly afterwards. By the time the trio catches it, and realise Bink is not on board, they then realise that he crawled into the lady's bag and follow her. An altercation ensues after they insult her (when she insults them), and while they attempt their escape, Bink crawls up to a revolving door at the entrance to a department store and is forced inwards by its momentum.  Crawling through the Marshall Fields department store, Bink is stopped by a worker who works for Mother Goose Corner, a nearby day care center, who believes he is another baby who escaped from there. He later escapes there and the store and eventually crawls into traffic after a ride on a taxi cab. The kidnappers attempt to follow him but keep getting injured in the process as he makes his way to the city zoo. They are shocked to find him in the primate house with a [[gorilla]]. It shows a maternal side and does not injure him. The kidnappers try to retrieve him but it notices and hits Veeko's hand, throws Norby into the air using a mop as a catapult, and hurls Eddie against the bars of the cage opposite its own.  The kidnappers eventually corner and catch Bink in the zoo's park, but are confronted by two friendly police officers, who have noticed that their van's engine is still running. During the conversation, Eddie hides Bink under his coat in his lap, but he reaches Eddie's cigarette lighter, sets his crotch on fire, and sneaks off as soon as the officers are gone. Veeko extinguishes the fire by stomping repeatedly on Eddie's groin. They follow Bink to a construction yard, but are still unable to catch him, with Veeko getting thrown off the building (after falling onto one of the construction workers lift) and into the back of a garbage truck, Norby falling into a vat of wet cement, and Eddie getting stranded on a crane after being drenched in glue. The sun sets as Bink leaves the construction yard. The kidnappers manage to escape (offscreen), but decide to give up and go home.  Bink's parents are notified of various sightings of him in the city and Gilbertine deduces that he has been following his favorite book (or "Boo-Boo", as Bink calls it), and will most likely head for the Old Soldiers' Home next. Sure enough, they find him there, but on the way home, he begins to call out "Boo-Boo" toward the kidnappers' flat. The FBI move in and arrest the kidnappers, who return Bink's book.  Back home, Bink is put to bed by his parents. As they discuss having his picture taken by a normal photographer in the morning, he wakes up and gets ready to read another book, ''Baby's Trip to China''.

Before the Rain (1994 film)
 Set against the background of political turbulence in Macedonia<ref></ref> and contemporary London, three love stories intertwine to create a powerful portrait of modern Europe in Milcho Manchevski’s ''Before the Rain''.  When a mysterious incident in the fabled Macedonian mountains blows out of proportion, it threatens to start a civil war, and brings together a young monk who has taken a vow of silence, a London picture editor, and a disillusioned war photographer in this tragic tale of fated lovers. Told in three parts that connect in an illusionistic circular narrative, and linked by characters and events, Before The Rain explores the uncompromising nature of war as it ravages the lives of  the unsuspecting, and forces the innocent to take sides.  In the first episode, ''Words'', we meet Kiril, a young [[monk]] who has taken a [[vow of silence]], who stands up for Zamira, a young Albanian girl who is accused of [[murder]] and is on the run from a mob. For her sake, Kiril leaves the [[monastery]] and the two of them make their way through the Macedonian landscape, but their romance is heading towards a sudden and brutal end.  ''Faces'' is set in bustling and trendy [[London]]. Anne, a picture editor, is torn between the love of her husband Nick and the attraction she feels for Aleksandar, a disillusioned war photographer. She is pulled into a series of tragic events, culminating in tragic events in a chic restaurant.  The third and final story, ''Pictures'', brings the two previous stories together. It focuses on Aleksandar's return to Macedonia to settle. He learns that the war has divided his home village and that his Albanian neighbours are now seen as enemies. Hana, an Albanian woman he was, and apparently still is, in love with, asks him to take care of her daughter Zamira. While Aleksandar sets out to find the girl, a storm is building on the horizon, and the film returns us to its beginning.  ===Story notes=== Upon watching the film, the viewer sees that the sequence of sections could have been any of three (Words, Faces, Pictures; Faces, Pictures, Words; or Pictures, Words, Faces). An intended inconsistency becomes apparent. The end of ''Words'' shows Zamira gunned down and killed by her family when she tries to escape them. Still photos of the scene are shown in ''Faces''.  Suddenly the reappearance of Zamira's photo and Kiril's voice (in a telephone call) in ''Pictures,'' coupled with the ending, which returns to the beginning, could temporarily hoodwink the viewer that this is the first part of the film. But a close observation of the man lying dead near the beginning of ''Words'' shows he is Aleksandar Kirkov, while Zamira is hiding in Kirill's after having killed one of the Macedonians.<ref></ref> ''Faces,'' set in London, has a living Aleksandar Kirkov, whose close friend Anne is developing black-and-white pictures of a dead Zamira. The motto of the film is, "The Circle is not Round."  The message is written as graffiti on a wall shown in ''Pictures'' and is repeated in the other two parts by Father Marko The director suggests that in life, people and places may change, but overshadowing scenarios (such as conflicts) go backward and forward in a cycle.

Now Nirmala decides to take revenge on the owner of the factory, J.V., for having changed her life (she was working in his factory only as a worker, but was thrown out and circumstances forced her to become a prostitute.  She dresses up like Bulbul, a modern prostitute and decides to meet up with J.V. and she says would he like to be her client for a day. J.V. slaps her, saying he is a good human being and the habit she has is really bad and that she is characterless.  Jeevanlal though, does not know where his daughter is living and how she now looks, but comes across a child called Kiran on the road on a fine day. He asks Kiran why she is crying. Then Rajan Dada says he wants to sell that girl as she has been brought up by Chacha-Chachi in this area and its none of Jeevanlal's business. J.V. replies to him saying this girl reminds him of his own daughter Guddu and asks whether Kiran's mother's name is Nirmala. J.V. harbors doubt in his mind, but Rajan Dada and Chachi stop Kiran from disclosing her mother's name and J.V. asks Kulkarni to find the name of Kiran's parents. Later, he finds Bulbul again in the profession of prostitute and advises her saying that she should not be in this profession and that she is like a daughter to him. Then Bulbul says J.V. you are responsible me for being thrown out of your factory and making me a prostitute, otherwise I would have been a simple working-class woman.  Nirmala does not recognize her dad's face immediately, but soon her memory works and she realizes that J.V. is her own father from whom she got separated after that fateful night, but chooses to not let J.V. know the truth. Later Jeevanlal tries his best to solve all her problems including dealing with Rajan Dada, who is responsible for Nirmala's husband's early death and Kiran separating from her mother Nirmala.

Beverly Hills Cop III
  One night in Detroit, Axel Foley plans to arrest a gang of car thieves who run a local [[chop shop]]. Unbeknownst to his boss, Inspector G. Douglas Todd, Axel has canceled the [[SWAT]], intending to raid the shop using only his team. Meanwhile, a group of men arrive at the chop shop to pick up a [[cube van]] that the car thieves had hijacked. The leader of the group confirms that the vehicle still contains its cargo, which consists of crates labelled as property of the U.S. government, then has his men execute the car thieves.  As the murderers are about to leave, Axel, unaware of what has happened inside, proceeds with his plan to enter the shop and quickly finds his team outgunned. Todd, arriving moments later, is fatally shot by the group's leader. As the perpetrators escape in the cube van, an angry Axel gives chase in one of the partially disassembled cars from the shop, but is prevented from continuing the chase by [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] Agent Steve Fulbright. Fulbright informs Axel that the killer must remain on the loose because the federal government is pursuing a larger scheme in which he is involved.  After Todd's funeral, Axel learns that several clues left behind by the killers point to Wonder World, a theme park in [[Beverly Hills, California]] owned by "Uncle" Dave Thorton. Axel arrives in Beverly Hills and reunites with his friend Billy Rosewood, who has been promoted to "Deputy Director of Operations for Joint Systems Interdepartmental Operational Command" (DDO-JSIOC), and meets Jon Flint, Billy's new partner after John Taggart's retirement. Axel asks Flint to call his friend Ellis DeWald, the head of Wonder World's park security, to let him know that he's coming to the park for his investigation.  Axel meets and befriends Janice Perkins ([[Theresa Randle]]) whilst touring the park's behind-the-scenes facilities. Later, he is spotted by security, shot at and attacked hand-to-hand. Axel retreats to the surface where he cuts in line to enter the Spider [[Ferris wheel]] ride. The guards accidentally jam the ride, placing two little kids' lives in danger. Axel rescues them and is subsequently taken to park manager Orrin Sanderson. When DeWald is called in to contest the claim that Axel was attacked by the security men without prior challenge, Axel immediately recognizes DeWald as Todd's killer, but Rosewood and Flint refuse to believe that claim because DeWald is keeping an impeccable public reputation.  However, Axel is later visited by Uncle Dave and Janice, who inform him that the Wonder World park's designer and Dave's close friend, Roger Fry, has mysteriously disappeared while inspecting the grounds two weeks ago, leaving only a letter with a cryptic message. He tries to heckle DeWald into revealing his criminal involvements, despite continued admonishments by Agent Fulbright, but DeWald proves too smooth to be caught in a mistake. When Axel later digs deeper into a closed-off section of the park, he finds out that DeWald and Sanderson run a [[counterfeit]]ing ring that uses Wonder World as a front, and DeWald was at the chop shop in Detroit to get his hands on blank printing paper used for American currency. Axel later meets with Uncle Dave to ask him about further details to find a piece of viable evidence, and thereby discovers that Fry's warning letter is actually written on a sheet of the stolen mint paper. Before he can make use of that evidence, however, Uncle Dave is shot by DeWald, and Axel is framed for his shooting.  After getting away from DeWald and bringing Uncle Dave to the next hospital, Axel sets out to prove his innocence by storming the park, calling Rosewood and Flint to assist him. The resulting shootout kills DeWald's henchmen, and after a hand-to-hand fight Axel shoots and kills DeWald. Agent Fulbright appears to explain that Axel was right, but Axel realizes his actual involvement with the counterfeiter and shoots him during a brief struggle. Uncle Dave makes a full recovery, and he thanks Axel for his assistance by creating a new character for Wonder World in his honor, Axel Fox.

Bionic Ever After?
 [[Jaime Sommers (The Bionic Woman)|Jaime Sommers]] is counseling OSI agent Kimberly Harmon, who was severely traumatized on her last mission and begs Jaime for help getting out of the OSI. Jaime informs [[Oscar Goldman]] that Kimberly is unfit for an upcoming mission and needs time to heal. On the way to meet her [[fiancé]] [[Steve Austin (character)|Steve Austin]] at his boat, her [[bionic]] ear malfunctions, greatly amplifying the sounds around her and causing her to wince in pain. The two discuss the plans for their upcoming wedding. Later, while playing an bionically-intense [[racquetball]] game with Steve, Jaime's right hand appears to be giving her trouble, allowing Steve to win for the first time. The next evening, her hand pain begins to worsen and Steve takes notice. That night as Jaime lays immobile in bed, someone replaces one of the computer chips in her bionic right arm with a new one labelled "Phase 2".  At the U.S. Embassy in [[Nassau, Bahamas]], Oscar visits with U.S. Ambassador John MacNamara and his wife Carolyn, who are preparing to host a ball with guest of honor, tennis star Astaad Rashid. Oscar leaves with regrets, explaining that he is [[best man]] at Steve and Jaime's wedding and can't stay.  On the day of the ball, an armed team in a black van infiltrates the Embassy, taking the Ambassador, his wife, and their guests hostage. The group, led by Miles Kendrick, deploys a [[Scud]] missile with a nuclear core pointed at the heart of the city as insurance against a rescue attempt and demand that Rashid by handed over to them.  Back in Washington, Jaime explains to Oscar that her bionic systems seem to be breaking down and that she's worried about the impact it will have on Steve and their wedding. The discussion is put on hold as word of the embassy attack comes in. Later, while in a counseling session with Kimberly, Jaime collapses and is rushed to the hospital. Dr. Rudy Wells, the pioneering bionic surgeon, tells Steve that Jaime might have neurological damage and may never be bionic again. In the hospital, Jaime sends Steve away, and he is forced to cancel the wedding.  Not willing to sit idly as Jaime suffers and to repay a life-saving debt to John MacNamara, Steve asks Oscar for an assignment to resolve the embassy situation. Kimberly meets with Steve, telling him that Oscar assigned her as his partner on the mission. Inside the embassy, Kendrick's men are searching for Rashid, hidden somewhere within. Steve and Kimberly arrive in Nassau and begin making preparations for the rescue. After giving him a cup of drugged coffee, Kimberly cuts open Steve's bionic arm in the same way Jaime's was earlier.  Dr. Wells discovers that Jaime is suffering from a computer virus which has infiltrated her bionic systems. He resolves to shut down her power supply completely and replace the infected chips. Jaime wakes and Rudy tells her that he took the opportunity to make some "improvements". Rudy talks to Oscar, explaining that he had an associate in his bionics  research, Dr. Jason Haviland, with whom he had a falling out and who he suspects might have a motive and knowledge to sabotage Jaime. She and Oscar visit Connie Haviland, Jason's widow, who explains that leaving the OSI and bionics research took a toll, causing him to drink heavily until he died of [[cirrhosis]] four months earlier. They spot a picture of Kimberly in Connie's house, revealing that Kimberly Harmon is in fact Kimberly Haviland, Jason's daughter, and that she is familiar with her father's work. OSI finds [[shortwave radio]] equipment in her apartment, revealing that she has been in contact with Kendrick.  Steve makes his entry into the embassy by bionically jumping to the [[water tower]] which is coincidentally where Rashid has been hiding. Kendrick's men, hearing sound from the tower, capture Rashid instead of Steve. Steve's bionics begin to break down and he, too, is captured by Kendrick and thrown into the basement.  Jaime arrives in Nassau and confronts Kimberly before making her way into the embassy under cover of darkness aided by bionic night vision, one of the "improvements" of which Rudy spoke. She kicks down the basement door and rescues Steve and the other hostages. A radiation alert rings out across the city and Oscar sends a nuclear containment (NEC) team into the embassy. Kendrick's men change into matching NEC outfits to cover their escape by replacing the real NEC team. Kendrick's team loads into an NEC truck, driven by Kimberly, taking an unconscious Rashid with them. Steve and Jaime give chase, bionically running after the truck. Miles pulls out a remote detonator telling Kimberly that once they escape, he'll ensure no one will follow them. Jaime grabs a [[manhole cover]] and, using a new bionic targeting display, throws it at the truck, causing it to flip over. In a moment of regret, Kimberly whispers a warning to Jaime about the detonator. She tells Steve, who shoots the remote and ends the threat.  Some time later, the wedding of Jaime and Steve commences. Rudy gives away the bride to Steve, who eagerly skips straight to the "[[marriage vows|I do]]". The couple kiss, ignoring the rest of the formalities, and the annoyed minister pronounces them husband and wife.  
Blank Check (film)
 On a rainy night, convicted bank robber Carl Quigley (Miguel Ferrer) escapes from prison and heads to a warehouse to recover a hidden safe box containing $1,000,000, which he hid there sometime before his arrest.   The film then cuts to eleven year old Preston Waters (Brian Bonsall), whose father (James Rebhorn) works as an investor for a living and is very frugal with money — so much so that when Preston is given a blank check from his grandmother for his birthday, his dad fills it out for only $11.00. When invited to classmate Butch's birthday party at an amusement park, Preston doesn't want to go because Butch acts more like a bully than a friend (unbeknownst to Preston's parents) and that Preston can only afford the cheap kiddie rides as his father only gave him a paltry bit of cash.  Quigley visits bank president Edward Biderman (Michael Lerner) in his bank office to discuss his plan. As the stolen money was [[Marked bill|consecutive and traceable]], Biderman is to [[money laundering|exchange the marked bills for unmarked]]. Quigley explains that his assistant and right-hand man, Juice (Tone Loc) will be stopping by Biderman's office with a check to be cashed for $1,000,000 the next day at 1:00 P.M.   After the meeting, Quigley runs over Preston's bicycle in a [[Jaguar XJ]] while Preston was riding out of the bank's parking lot chasing after Butch who stole his birthday check. Pressed for time as he sees a police car patrolling the area, Quigley, posing as a realtor, gives Preston a signed blank check and tells him to give it to his dad so they can buy him a new bike. Instead, Preston fills out the check for $1,000,000 by printing it on his computer. He goes to the bank the next day and is directed to Biderman's office by a teller (as the teller thought Preston was joking and she could not cash a check that size herself). Mistaken that Juice has arrived, Biderman cashes his check with $1,000,000 from a safe behind a painting.  As Preston is leaving the bank, the real Juice enters Biderman's office with another check for $1,000,000. Realizing that Biderman mistook Preston for Juice, the trio begins a frantic search for Preston. Meanwhile, he embarks on an extreme shopping spree over the course of 6 days, buying a castle style house (by outbidding Quigley using the voice box on his computer over the phone) along with many other expensive items (limousine service, go kart track, water slide, etc.). He spends $999,667.83 of the original $1,000,000. Preston covers himself by saying he is making these purchases for a millionaire known as "Macintosh" (named after the brand of Preston's computer) who lives in the castle house. He also makes friends with his limo driver Henry. Preston also gets even with Butch and his brothers with his money.   The entire time, Preston was being investigated by FBI agent Shay Stanley (Karen Duffy) (working undercover as a teller at Biderman's bank and Preston's crush) for money laundering, as the bills he was using to make his purchases were Biderman's watermarked ones.   Preston throws an elaborate birthday party for himself under the guise of Macintosh. His father wants Preston to come home; however, he doesn't know that Macintosh is his son. He asks Macintosh to send his son home. However, he cannot pay for it, as everything depleted his account save for $332.17. He is then forced into a showdown with Quigley, Juice and Biderman. After the trio manage to capture him and demand to know what happened with the money, he admits Macintosh is a false name, to which Biderman suggests that Quigley can use Preston's purchases and the Macintosh name to give himself a new identity.  When the trio is confronted by the FBI at Preston's castle house, Quigley claims to be Macintosh. However, with the FBI knowing that Mr. Macintosh had been using the watermarked bills, they arrest Quigley, Juice and Biderman. Shay kisses Preston before parting ways and Preston and Henry say their farewells. After Preston gets home his family throws him a birthday party. His father apologizes for being so harsh with him when it came to money. Preston's family surprises him with a cake and ask him to make a wish. Preston thinks he already has everything he wished for, until he sees Shay's flyer at the bank and decides to make a wish about her.

It is an assault unlike anything in the history of man or beast – except for an old timer who recalls a similar, horrific outbreak that gripped the West Coast three decades ago in [[Bodega Bay, California]].  
Black Beauty (1994 film)
 Black Beauty (voiced by [[Alan Cumming]]; played by [[Docs Keepin Time]]) narrates his own story. He is born on a farm in the English countryside and remains by his mother's side until he is sent to Birtwick Park to serve Squire Gordon and his family.  Lady Gordon, the squire's ill wife, is pleased by the beautiful horse and gives him his trademark name, Black Beauty. Beauty is smitten with the squire's bitter chestnut mare, Ginger, who rebuffs his attempts to be friendly. However, Beauty also befriends Merrylegs, a perky grey pony who gives rides to the squire's young daughters, Jessica and Molly.  On a stormy night, Beauty is pulling a carriage holding the squire and his caretaker, John Manly ([[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]]), home from town, but sensing danger refuses to cross a partially flooded bridge. When John tries to pull him to move, Beauty steadfastly refuses. When the bridge finally gives way, crashing into the river, John slips and falls in, but manages to hang on to Beauty's bridle. Beauty and the squire save John, and they again head off back home.  Young Joe Green, who works in the stable, volunteers to look after Beauty that night. Joe's lack of knowledge about horses causes him to give Beauty ice cold water to drink and to neglect to dry him off or cover him with a rug for overnight, which causes Beauty to fall ill. The following few days John, Joe, and the squire treat and nurse Beauty, and he recovers.   Lady Gordon's illness gets worse, and she is taken to a doctor in a carriage pulled by Beauty and Ginger. When they stop at an inn for the night, the barn where the horses are being kept catches on fire due to a carelessly dropped pipe. Joe rescues the horses.   Lady Gordon's doctor orders her to leave England for a warmer place because her illness is so advanced. The squire and his family bid a sad goodbye to John, Joe, and the beloved horses. Merrylegs is given to the vicar who promises never to sell the pony.  Beauty and Ginger are taken to Earlshall Park, home of the Lord and Lady of Wexmire, and Joe bids a tearful goodbye to Beauty. Beauty and Ginger are paired up to pull Lady Wexmire's carriage, but she demands that the horses wear uncomfortable [[Overcheck|bearing reins]] to raise their heads high, which angers Ginger. When the next day Lady Wexmire orders the horse's heads be strapped up even further, Ginger breaks away from the carriage in a rage. Lady Wexmire never calls for Ginger to pull her carriages again.   Reuben Smith, the horses' new caretaker, rides to town with Beauty to take a carriage to be repainted. He becomes drunk at the local tavern. He nevertheless roughly rides Beauty home, who is losing one of his shoes. When the shoe finally falls off, Beauty stumbles and throws Reuben off the saddle, causing both rider and horse to suffer injuries. Both are found the next morning by Wexmire's men. Reuben is dismissed from his job, and Beauty is later sold by Lord Wexmire due to his disfigured knees.  Beauty is bought by a man who keeps horses for renting, but treats them terribly. He is eventually taken to a fair, where he briefly spots Joe, now a grown-up, but Joe doesn't notice him. Beauty's whinnies instead catch the attention of Jerry Barker, a  taxi carriage driver from [[London]], who's immediately taken by Beauty and buys him once successfully haggling the cost down to 17 [[guineas]].  Jerry introduces Beauty to his warm family - wife and two young children, who name him Black Jack. Though Beauty dislikes the harshness of London, he nevertheless likes his job as a taxi cab horse and Jerry's kind treatment of him. One day, Beauty spots and reunites with Ginger, now a cab horse, but has suffered from years of abuse by her owner. Beauty begs for her not to give up, but too soon she's led away by her owner on a fare. Some time later, Beauty spots her dead body on a wagon, her troubles finally over.  One snowy night, Jerry has a dreadful cough that worsens as he's kept waiting for hours outdoors in the freezing weather for his passengers to leave a party. His condition then worsens and a doctor advises him to quit his job and move to the countryside. Beauty is reluctantly sold to a grain dealer where he's forced to pull heavy loads of flour. For two years of pulling heavy carts, he collapses from utter exhaustion.  He is taken to a fair to be sold, but he is now so weak and in poor condition that no one wants to buy him. Then Farmer Thoroughgood and his grandson spot Beauty, and a young man sees him, too. Beauty realizes that the young man is Joe, and though he's hardly able to, he finds the strength and whinnies for his old friend and the two are finally reunited.  Beauty lives the remainder of his life at Thoroughgood's farm with Joe, who promises that he will never sell Beauty.  
Blackbirds at Bangpleng

The alien offspring have the power to kill by just staring and they have an insatiable appetite for raw meat.  
Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre
 The movie does not have a central storyline, though it follows individual members of a Chinese family during the [[Nanking Massacre]]. The movie begins after the Japanese have captured the city and begin a "cleanup" phase. Homes are broken into and burned, the residents killed and raped. Bowing to international pressure, the Japanese government has agreed to establish refugee [[Nanking Safety Zone|safety zones]], only to violate the agreement at their whim, knowing that there is no force that can really prevent them from doing so. As a result, they regularly enter the refugee camps, kidnapping women and executing Chinese policemen and suspected soldiers. Several foreign residents try to defend the refugees, and while they carry weight due to their political ties, they ultimately cannot stand against the armed troops. Some of the foreigners depicted in the film include the German businessman [[John Rabe]] and U.S. missionary [[Minnie Vautrin]].  A local man who speaks Japanese interprets the soldiers' orders to the Chinese civilians. In reality, the speeches are meant simply to lure the Chinese onto the streets, where they are shot and killed wholesale with machine guns. A handful of resistance remains, however, and one Chinese man feigns death, and then pulls a grenade from a passing soldier, blowing them both up. Having now been unofficially employed by the Japanese, the interpreter assists them in distributing propaganda and is accosted by his fellow Chinese as being a traitor and collaborator. He dismisses their indignation, taunting them with their own lack of will to fight the Japanese. He follows a high-ranking Japanese officer around the country. One day a couple of Japanese reporters show up to interview the officer and take pictures of him. They request to have the officer pose with his sword, ready to strike a Chinese man. Having no other Chinese around, they suggest he use the interpreter, who has little choice but to go along with it. Unsurprisingly, as the Japanese officer poses for the camera, he actually goes through and kills his lackey, to the horror of the cameramen.  Members of the family remain hiding in their house, believing the end of military engagement to signify safety. Soon, however, some Japanese troops break down the door. The eldest son, along with two small children, John and Jean, are told to flee the house. In the meantime, the parents and an elderly grandmother try to distract the guards. The kids run off and, over the course of the film, are made to survive on the streets. However, the small children become isolated when the elder son is rounded up with a group of other men. The elder son, having been given official papers by the Japanese, eventually returns home to find that the parents are dead, the mother's body having been stripped naked and apparently raped. Their grandmother, alive but also apparently having been raped, is obviously distraught, lying on the floor still half-naked. The troops, still inside the house, immediately accost the son and kill him. Later, the two small children also make their way back to the house, only to find their relatives dead and the grandmother about to burn the bodies inside the house, along with herself. At that moment, a patrol discovers the two kids standing in the doorway, and they immediately proceed to assault Jean, the little girl. Having no other recourse, the grandmother pushes John, the last of her family, out the door and locks it. While the soldiers are distracted in their attempt to rape the girl, the melancholy grandmother sets the house on fire, trapping everyone inside to a fiery death.  The Japanese troops surround a Buddhist temple. Inside, the pacifist monks are praying. The troops bring them out one at a time, killing them outside. The Japanese, claiming to be Buddhists also, presumably want to keep the temple itself clean. The bodies of the monks are stacked in a grisly pile, and each monk that is brought out is an unfortunate witness to the scene. Eventually, the troops work their way to the last man, the elder priest, who resigns himself to his fate with a look of disgust towards the Japanese. Another monk, who manages not to be killed so far, is standing in line for food, when a scuffle breaks out due to women who have disguised themselves as men, trying to avoid rape. The monk attempts to stop the violence, and becomes entangled in it when they strip him down and try to force him to have sex with one of the women. He refuses, and the troops slash him in the groin.  In the epilogue, it is stated that most of the Japanese officers depicted in the film were tried for war crimes and executed.

Blue Sky (film)
 In 1962, [[Major]] Hank Marshall ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]) and his wife, Carly ([[Jessica Lange]]), are having marital problems because of the pressures of his job and her [[mental illness]]. Hank is a [[nuclear engineering|nuclear engineer]] who favors underground [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear testing]], an initiative code-named "Blue Sky", as opposed to above-ground, open-air detonations. Carly is a free spirit who appears to be mentally unbalanced and who is slowly being suffocated by domestic torpor and encroaching age. Her behavior embarrasses him, especially given the restrictions that prevail within a military base. Their move from [[Hawaii]] to an isolated base in [[Alabama]] alarms their oldest daughter, Alex ([[Amy Locane]]), and sends Carly into a violent tantrum.  The following day, Hank has his first meeting with base commander [[Colonel]] Vince Johnson ([[Powers Boothe]]), who rebuffs his underground testing initiative despite strong scientific support. Meanwhile, Vince's wife Vera ([[Carrie Snodgress]]) welcomes Carly and invites her to a party organized by the base officers' wives. Carly gets drunk at the party and demonstrates exotic dancing skills. Vera begs her husband to do something about her, to which Vince agrees but says he'll have to get Hank out of the way first.  Alex starts dating Vince's son Glen ([[Chris O'Donnell]]) and on their first date finds what she takes to be a dud grenade. It explodes, alerting the whole base to their relationship and giving Vince more reason to get rid of Hank. Carly is invited by the other officers' wives to join them for a dance recital, and fills her time rehearsing for it. Hank is sent to the [[Nevada Test Site]] to supervise the first underground test under [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Robert Jennings ([[Michael McClendon (actor director)|Michael McClendon]]).  During the first test, Hank notices two [[cowboy]]s in the test area and attempts to have Robert abort the test, but Robert refuses, explicitly telling Hank that he is not concerned with the cowboys' health or their lives, and sends Hank back to Alabama. While Hank is away, Alex and Glen discover Vince sent Hank away just so he could have an [[affair]] with Carly.  Hank learns of the affair at the dance recital and reacts violently, after which he is given two options: have his wife and commanding officer [[court-martial]]ed with him, or spend time in a [[psychiatric hospital]] receiving therapy over how the news has affected him. In debating the decision it quickly comes to light that a court martial would require bringing the incident with the cowboys out in public. Hank is eventually committed to the hospital.  The hospital keeps him so heavily sedated he is unable to leave. Carly, suspecting there is a reason for this, digs through Hank's papers and finds the report about the two cowboys. She drives across the country with her daughters and finds the cowboys with visible [[radiation sickness]]. She begs them to bring their story to the press, but the cowboys refuse, so she steals one of their horses and rides into the test site, intent on repeating their experience to get the attention of the press. She is arrested, which gets the attention of the press, and Robert is forced to let her, and Hank, go.  She returns home to find Hank waiting for her, having quit that morning, and that Vince has been relieved of his duties. Hank tells her he found a new job in California, and the family happily moves.  
Blink (film)
  Emma Brody is a young musician who has been [[blindness|blind]] for 20 years. New surgery techniques restore her vision but initially cause "vision flashes" that leave her uncertain about what she sees. One night, she is awakened by a noise in the apartment above. Peeking out her door, she "sees" a figure descending the stairs. She contacts the police, worried that her neighbor has been murdered, but is unsure whether it was just her new vision deceiving her. The killer then begins to [[stalking|stalk]] Emma.  
Blankman
  Darryl Walker ([[Damon Wayans]]) is a clumsy [[nerdy]] repairman, who is a genius and [[Batman (TV series)|Batman]] fan. Darryl has a pure heart and an optimistic [[Pollyanna|Pollyannish]] personality. He is childishly naive to the realities of living in an inner city neighborhood. The area suffers from political corruption and the police are on strike. It takes the murder of his grandmother, an avid supporter of Alderman Marvin Harris' anti-corruption campaign for Mayor, by members of mobster Michael Minelli's gang, to awaken him to the realities of his city's urban decay.  He expresses his frustrations by intervening in a situation and boldly saving an elderly transit passenger from being [[mugged]], and by ranting about the general corruptible state that the city has become. Darryl was so pure and shielded from reality presumably because of his interest in inventing, that he does not even realize that there is a "[[crackhouse]] in front of [their] flat". He tries to storm into it unarmed and rebuke the gang members, oblivious to the hazardous stupidity of doing so.  Awakened to the city's issues, Darryl is inspired to become a vigilante super hero. He uses his technical expertise to create weapons and gadgets. One of his experiments accidentally allows him to create bulletproof clothing, which gives him some protection in his quest. His brother Kevin, a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] news cameraman, goes along with this fantasy, believing that it's Darryl's way to cope with the murder of his grandmother. Darryl demands an audience with the [[police commissioner]], but the police are not impressed with his actions, ridicule him, and arrest him for disturbing the peace. Darryl is released on orders to see a psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist calls Darryl normal, but a [[geek]], infuriating Kevin, who the psychiatrist then attempts to psychoanalyze. After Darryl is nearly killed trying to protect a citizen on the street, Kevin tries to get him to tone his activities down, advising him to start a neighborhood watch. After he delivers a woman's baby in an elevator, he is asked for his name. Darryl just stares, and Kevin replies, "He's gone blank, ma'am."  Both the lady and the reporters interpret this as a name: Blankman.  Over time he protects various other people in the community, building up a reputation and inspiring both the town and other [[real life superheroes]]. Kevin, hoping to win the affections of Kimberly Jonz, a reporter at his TV station, begs Darryl to allow her to interview him. He relents, on the condition that she wear a [[carnation]]. He brings her to his secret hideout, an abandoned subway station, and they talk about how he took up his duties to memorialize his grandmother and prevent crime. Impressed by his heroics and modesty, Kimberly immediately falls in love with Darryl and she kisses him causing him to have an [[erection]].  Mayor Harris, who refused Minelli's attempts at bribery, attempts to bring in outside money to pay the IOUs the city has been giving its workers. He also requests that Blankman be there to protect the people and receive a special award. As the money is released, Minelli's henchmen storm the bank and take the mayor hostage, threatening to detonate explosives. At the police chief's request and the crowd's chants, Blankman attempts to save the mayor but is unable to defuse all the bombs.  He reveals his identity to the mayor and tells him of his grandmother's support for the mayor. Mayor Harris wishes him well, warning him to run and says he will tell Mrs. Walker about Darryl. Blankman runs out screaming as the bank explodes, killing Harris. The crowd, seeing his failure, turn on him, chasing him down the street. Darryl then gives up his heroic works for a normal life, getting a job at a [[McDonald's]].  Wanting a great story Kevin's boss Larry Stone, a tabloid news junkie, manages to contact Minelli and trades knowledge of Blankman's love for Kimberly in exchange for an exclusive interview. In the midst of doing research on Minelli and Darryl's grandmother's death, Kimberly calls Kevin with the news. As Kevin answers, Minelli takes Kimberly hostage. Minelli issues a verbal threat to Kevin (thinking he is talking to Blankman), telling him he will kill Kimberly if Blankman does not show up.  Kevin rushes to Darryl's workplace with the news, but Darryl refuses to help wanting a normal life. Kevin finally convinces him with the news that Minelli had their grandmother killed and that he will wear the costume Darryl designed for him. The two rush to Darryl's underground lair where he again turns into Blankman. Kevin becomes his new sidekick but without a name. He just goes by "Other Guy". The two heroes then rush to the TV station.  After shooting the reporter interviewing him, Minelli becomes fed up. While threatening Stone, Blankman and Other Guy crash through the window and attempt a rescue. The two engage in a fight with Minelli's goons, losing. They are placed in a water tank and left to slowly drown. Stone and Kimberly are chained to desks and left to die as Minelli has hidden bombs in the building. At this point, Blankman calls in J-5, his robot assistant, to save them. J-5 drills a hole in the tank and the pair kick their way to freedom at the last minute.  The duo then search for the bombs, finding them in a women's bathroom. Activating J-5's "[[bomb disposal]] mode," Blankman stuffs the explosives inside and frees Kimberly. Stone is left behind, a joke Other Guy wants to play on his boss. Once outside, the explosives detonate, destroying J-5. Distraught, Blankman swears [[revenge]].  Tracking Minelli to his hideout in a factory, the two prepare for the final battle. Other Guy, however, is overconfident and is wounded because his costume is not [[bulletproof]] like Darryl's. Blankman then defeats Minelli's goons with his electric "newchucks" ([[nunchucks]]). Just when Minelli is about to kill Other Guy, Blankman activates his jet-powered [[roller blades]] and captures Minelli and delivers him to the police. Blankman is once again acknowledged as a hero (this time, along with Other Guy) by the people, receiving the Mayor Harris Award for outstanding community service at a ceremony in their honor. Other Guy receives a Blankman T-shirt (much to Kevin's disgust).  After the ceremony, Kevin introduces Kimberly to "Darryl." The two make light conversation until Kimberly pretends to see a purse snatcher, putting Darryl on alert. Kimberly then reveals she knows that they are Blankman and Other Guy, and she kisses Darryl to prove it.  Darryl falls to the ground after getting the same embarrassing reaction he had the first time while Kevin and Kimberly laugh at him. The film ends with a shot of a banner that reads "We Love You Blankman...and the Other Guy".  
Blue Chips
 Pete Bell, a [[college basketball]] coach for the Western University Dolphins in Los Angeles, is under a lot of pressure. His team isn't winning as often as it once did and his successful program needs to attract new star players and fast. But the brightest stars of the future—the so-called "blue-chip" prospects—are secretly being paid by other schools.  This practice is forbidden in the college game, but Pete is desperate after a losing season. A school booster, greedy "friend of the program" Happy, will stop at nothing to land these star high school players for Western's next season and gets the okay from the coach to do so. This includes giving a new car to the gigantic Neon Boudeaux, a house and job to the mother of Butch McRae and a tractor to the father of farmboy Ricky Roe, as well as a bag filled with cash.  With sportswriter Ed suspecting a scandal, Pete continues to be contaminated by selfish demands from the players and a dirty association with the booster. His estranged wife, a former guidance counselor, agrees to tutor Neon, who has below average grades, but she feels betrayed when Pete lies to her about the new athletes receiving illegal inducements to attend the school.  Pete comes to realize that one of his senior players, Tony, a personal favorite, had "[[point shaving|shaved points]]" in a game his freshman season, conspiring to beat a gambling point spread. Pete is disgusted at what he and his program have become.  Western University has a big nationally televised game coming up versus Indiana, the #1 team in the country, coached by [[Bob Knight]]. After winning the game, Pete cannot bear the guilt of having cheated. At a press conference, he confesses to the entire scandal and resigns as head coach. Leaving the press conference and the arena, Pete walks past a small playground with kids playing basketball—he approaches, then helps coaching them.  An epilogue later reveals that the university would be suspended from tournament play for three years. Pete did continue to coach, but at the high school level; Tony graduated and played pro ball in Europe; Ricky Roe got injured and returned home to run the family farm, and Neon and Butch dropped out of college, but both now play in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].  
Blown Away (1994 film)
 Irish convict Ryan Gaerity escapes from his cell in a castle prison in Northern Ireland, killing a guard and his cellmate in the process, after turning a toilet into a bomb.  In Boston, Lt. Jimmy Dove is a veteran member of the police force's [[bomb squad]], on the verge of retirement and helping to train newer recruits. Dove hides that he is really Liam McGivney, a former member of a Northern Ireland terrorist cell. He had been friends with Gaerity, but when Gaerity tried to set off a bomb that would have killed numerous civilians, he interceded, ending in the death of his girlfriend, who was also Gaerity's sister, and leading to Gaerity's imprisonment. Devastated, McGivney had moved to Boston and took on a new identity, hoping to find atonement in saving others by defusing bombs. Only Dove's uncle Max O'Bannon is aware of his past and expresses his desire for Dove to retire early, having clearly shown his atonement.  Gaerity makes his way to Boston, taking residence in an abandoned casino boat, and tracks down Dove. He takes a job as a janitor at the police station to learn more about Dove's present life and his co-workers. Gaerity sets up bombs specifically designed to kill the defusers, which kill three of Dove's team members. Dove receives a call from Gaerity and realizes that his wife Kate and stepdaughter are in danger. He explains his true past to them, and convinces them to go into hiding at a nearby beach house. A member of Dove's squad, rookie technician Anthony Franklin, who has linked Dove's former life to Gaerity, is safely rescued from another bomb planted by Gaerity with Dove's aid, and promises Dove any assistance he can offer.  Max decides to try to stop Gaerity himself, trying to get close to him at an Irish bar, but instead ends up captured by him, and latched into a makeshift bomb. Dove tracks down Max, and goes to retrieve his tools, but Max, realizing that Gaerity had created the bomb to kill both of them, intentionally triggers the bomb while Dove is away, sacrificing himself. In analyzing the bomb's debris, Dove finds a roulette ball that points to the abandoned ship, where he finds Gaerity. Gaerity reveals that he has set up another bomb in Kate's car and activates its arming mechanism before engaging with Dove in a large mêlée fight throughout the booby-trapped ship, which has been rigged to blow up in a few minutes. Dove gains the upper hand, and handcuffs himself to Gaerity, preventing him from leaving, preparing to die to keep his secret and prevent anymore deaths. Dove is saved by Franklin at the last second, who had followed Dove to the ship, and the two escape in time before the ship explodes, killing Gaerity in the process.  The two race back to the city, hoping to stop Kate before she starts the car. They arrive too late but are able to catch up to Kate, and Dove jumps into her car. He finds the complex bomb and manages to defuse it in time. As they recover, Franklin tells Dove he knows his past identity but will keep it a secret if he can take credit for taking down Gaerity; Dove agrees and gives Franklin his badge before leaving with Kate and his stepdaughter.

Blue Tiger (film)
 Gina is a sweet and dedicated mother to her little son. One day, while shopping with him for a Halloween mask, her son is accidentally shot through the chest by a Japanese gunman who is trying to kill an opposing gang of bus operators. Gina notices that the gunman has a picture of a blue tiger tattooed on his chest. She becomes obsessed with vengeance and has an identical red tiger etched into her skin. She then tracks down the killer and plots his death. This leads her into the world of the Japanese Mafia, where she uses her sexual allure and newfound knowledge of the Japanese language to search the tattooed men for the same blue tiger bearer that killed her son.  
Bonsoir (film)
 Having first lost his wife then his job as a tweed tailor, Alex Ponttin ([[Michel Serrault]] from ''[[Happiness is in the field]]'') has devised a novel way to keep himself in touch with society.  He admits himself into people’s homes, by pretending to be a relative or an official, and persuading his victims to give him a night’s free board: He finds at first a lunch at the horrible couple Dumont (Jean-Pierre Bisson and Maike Jansen), where a thief follows him for a robbery. Alex spent an evening in front of TV at Marie ([[Marie-Christine Barrault]] from ''[[Cousin, cousine]]''), mother of seven children. He runs from Marie to find an evening and a new bed at the home of charming but shy lesbian Caroline ([[Claude Jade]] from ''[[Bed and Board (1970 film)|Bed and Board]]'') and her funny lover Gloria ([[Corinne Le Poulain]] from ''The Provocation'').   To save her inheritance, Caroline - accused for her homosexuality by her horrible sister Catherine (Laurence Vincendon) - tells her aunt Amélie (Monique Darpy), that Gloria is her secretary and Alex her lover. So Alex has to present himself nude in Caroline's bed. He saves Carolines inheritance. Fortunately, the police officers ([[Jean-Claude Dreyfus]] from ''[[Delicatessen (film)|Delicatessen]]'') investigating the case are so terminally stupid that Alex has little chance of being arrested…  As in many of [[Jean-Pierre Mocky]]’s films, there is a strong anti-establishment, almost anarchist sub-text.  This is manifested in the way that the self-proclaimed moral figures (the police, the clergy, even the President of the Republic) are presented in this film, but also in the elevation of Alex Ponttin (Michel Serrault) to the status of a public hero at the end of the film.  Whilst society and state sink into a numbing inertia, bereft of integrity and humanity, it is left to the eccentrics, the outsiders like worried Caroline (Claude Jade), who is attacked by her sister and her aunt because the secret of her [[homosexuality]], to build a more cohesive society and a better world. Michel Serrault excels in this off-the-wall satirical comedy which makes a bizarre assessment of modern life.  He plays an impish vagrant who uses his new-found freedom to improve the lives of his fellow man, by briefly insinuating himself into their lives.  Bonsoir goes much further and suggests that whole of modern society, not only the police, is culpable of mediocrity and moral laxity.   It takes an outsider like Alex Ponttin, free from the bonds of modern living, to point the way to a better future.  
Bottle Rocket
 In Arizona, Dignan "rescues" his friend Anthony from a voluntary psychiatric unit, where he has been staying for self-described exhaustion. Dignan has an elaborate escape plan and has developed a 75-year plan that he shows to Anthony. The plan is to pull off several heists, and then meet up with a Mr. Henry, a landscaper and part-time criminal known to Dignan.  As a practice heist, the two friends break into Anthony's family's house, stealing specific items from a previously agreed upon list. Afterward, critiquing the heist, Dignan reveals that he took a pair of earrings not specified on the list. This upsets Anthony, as he had purchased the earrings for his mother as a gift and specifically left them off the list. Anthony visits his little sister at her school and asks her to return the earrings. Dignan recruits Bob Mapplethorpe as a [[Crime scene getaway|getaway driver]] because he is the only person they know with a car. The three of them buy a gun and return to Bob's house to plan their next heist, which will be at a local bookstore. The group bickers as Dignan struggles to describe his intricate plan.  The group steals a small sum of money from the bookstore and go "on the lam", stopping to stay at a motel. Anthony meets Inez, one of the motel maids, and the two spark a romance despite their language barrier (Inez speaks little English, and Anthony barely any Spanish). Bob learns that his marijuana crop back home has been discovered by police, and that his older brother has been arrested. Bob leaves in his car the following day to help his brother, without telling Dignan. Before leaving the motel themselves, Anthony gives Dignan an envelope to give to Inez. Dignan delivers the envelope to Inez while she is cleaning a room, not knowing the envelope has most of his and Anthony's money inside. Inez does not open the envelope and hugs Dignan to say goodbye. As Dignan is leaving, Inez asks an English-speaking male friend of hers to chase after Dignan and tell him she loves Anthony. When he delivers the message he says, "Tell Anthony I love him". Dignan fails to realize he is speaking for Inez and does not deliver the message.  Dignan discovers a dilapidated but functional [[Alfa Romeo Spider]], and Dignan and Anthony continue with the 75-year plan. The car breaks down eventually and Anthony reveals that the envelope Dignan gave to Inez contained the rest of their cash. The two get in a confrontation and go their separate ways. Narrating a letter to his sister, Anthony says he and Bob have settled into a routine back at home that is keeping him busy. Dignan, who has joined Mr. Henry's gang, tracks Anthony down and they reconcile. Dignan invites Anthony to a heist with Mr. Henry and Anthony accepts on the condition that Bob is allowed in too. The trio meet the eccentric Mr. Henry and plan to rob a safe at a cold storage facility. Mr. Henry becomes a role model for the trio, standing up to Bob's abusive brother and tutoring Dignan on success. He invites the trio to a party at his house, and visits the group at the Mapplethorpes' house, which he compliments. Anthony learns of Inez's love for him and contacts her via phone. Her English has improved and the two rekindle their relationship.  The group conducts their heist at the cold storage facility with Applejack and Kumar, accomplices from Mr. Henry's landscaping company. The plan quickly falls apart with Kumar unable to crack the safe, and Bob accidentally firing his gun, which in turn triggers a cardiac event in Applejack. As the police arrive, Dignan has locked himself out of the escape van and is arrested and brutalized by the police. During the heist, Mr. Henry loads furniture from Bob's house into a truck. Later, Anthony and Bob visit Dignan in prison and tell him how Mr. Henry robbed Bob's house. While Bob and Anthony are saying their goodbyes, Dignan begins rattling off an escape plan and tells his friends to get into position for a get-away. After a tense moment, the two realize Dignan is joking. Dignan says to Anthony, "Isn't it funny that you used to be in the [[Psychiatric hospital|nuthouse]] and now I'm in jail?" as he walks back into the prison.  
Body Snatchers (1993 film)
 Steve Malone, an agent from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], is sent to a military base in Alabama to test possible effects on the surrounding [[Ecosystem|ecological system]] caused by military actions. With him is his teenage daughter from his first marriage, Marti, his second wife Carol, and Marti's half brother Andy. On their way to the base, they stop at a gas station. In the restroom, Marti is threatened by an [[military police|MP]] member with a knife. When he notices her fear, he lets go of her, satisfied that she shows an emotional response. Before she leaves the room, he warns her, "they get you when you sleep".  Steve and his family move into their new home on the base, and Marti makes friends with the base commander's daughter Jenn. On his first day in [[day care]], Andy runs away because he is recognized as an outsider among the other somehow [[Conformity|conformist]] children. He is picked up and brought home by helicopter pilot Tim. Marti and Tim quickly feel attracted to each other. Meanwhile, while examining soil samples, Steve is approached by medical officer Major Collins, who asks him about [[Psychology|psychological]] effects, particularly narcophobia (the fear of sleep), and their possible relation to toxication of the environment. Steve believes that a [[Physiology|physiological]] reaction would be more likely.  In the evening, Marti and Jenn go to the bar attended by the station's military personnel, where they meet not only Tim but also the MP who threatened Marti at the gas station. He denies that they ever met before. That night, a group of soldiers can be seen picking giant [[Legume|pods]] from the river running by the base. When Andy wakes up and enters his mother's room, Carol's body crumbles to dust, while a naked soulless double emerges from the closet. Nobody believes Andy's story that his real mother is dead and the person pretending to be Carol is only an impostor.  The following night, Marti and her father are nearly "taken over" too by duplicates emerging from the giant pods. Carol attempts to convince Steve that the takeover is a good thing, claiming that it ends confusion and anger. She also claims that there's no place to go, as the invasion is not an isolated incident. Steve is almost shocked and saddened into compliance, but Marti and Andy drag him out the door. Carol emits a shrill and mechanical scream that alerts other "pod people" to the presence of a human being. Now the majority in numbers, they swarm over the base chasing the remaining humans.  After hiding Marti and Andy in a warehouse, Steve enters Major Collins' office. The hysterical Major tries to call for help, but the line is blocked. While swallowing sleep-prevention pills Collins announces that it is too late to run; all they can do is fight. Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of a group of pod people, led by base commander General Platt. While Steve hides, the pod people try to convince the Major that the individual is not important, and that only conformity can solve the world's problems. The Major shoots himself rather than live in such a world.  Steve returns to his children and tells them to follow him, claiming to have found a way out. They drive aimlessly through the military base, as loudspeakers shout out instructions for spreading the invasion by carrying out pods in trucks. Realizing that her father was replicated while he was away, Marti swerves the car to the side and tries to escape with her brother. Tim, who escaped his former comrades who tried to turn him into one of them, suddenly appears and Marti takes his gun and shoots the person pretending to be her father. The Steve duplicate shrinks into a mass of seething, bloody goo.   Tim manages to get hold of a helicopter [[gunship]], but Marti and Andy are taken away by the pod people. They sedate both of them and take them to the base [[Hospital|infirmary]] where the remaining human beings are being systematically duplicated by pods. Tim is able to rescue Marti, despite her pod duplicate trying to seduce him into compliance.  Marti and Tim leave the building, pretending to be pod people so they can get to Tim's helicopter to escape. However, they are spotted by Jenn, now a pod duplicate, who gets suspicious and tells Marti she saw Andy looking for her. When Marti reacts displaying emotion, Jenn responds by giving out a pod scream to alert the other pod people. Tim and Marti manage to get in the helicopter and are joined at the last minute by Andy who runs up to them. But right after taking off, Andy, who is in reality a pod duplicate, attacks both and tries to bring down the helicopter. After a short scuffle, Marti is forced to throw Pod-Andy out of the helicopter and he gaves out a pod scream while falling to his death.  The ending of the film is an ambiguous one. Tim destroys the trucks filled with pods with the helicopter's rockets, while Marti confesses her profound hatred in a [[voice-over]] narration, thereby hinting at a loss of [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] quality. While they land on another base, the words of Marti's stepmother earlier in the film can be heard, suggesting that the phenomenon may have already spread beyond the army base: "Where you gonna go, where you gonna run, where you gonna hide? Nowhere... 'cause there's no one like you left."  
Boulevard (1994 film)
 The film is about a woman named Jennefer (played by [[Kari Wuhrer]]) who runs from her abusive boyfriend, gives her baby up for adoption and takes the next bus out of town. She ends up on the streets during a grim and cold winter in [[Toronto]]. She's taken in by a prostitute named Ola (played by [[Rae Dawn Chong]]). Ola sees the local pimp Hassan ([[Lou Diamond Phillips]]) murder another prostitute, but refuses to testify against him, knowing that Hassan has associates that would kill her if she snitched.

Ola eventually makes her way back to Toronto, and Jennefer greets her with relief. Feeling bad for not having found a job to help repay Ola's kindness, Jennefer becomes a prostitute with Ola taking her under her wing to learn the ropes.

While this had been going on Ola, convinced that Hassan had taken Jennefer and was forcing her to work for him and harm her like the rest of his girls, takes her gun and goes over to Hassan's house and demands to know where Jennefer is. Hassan tells her he doesn't have her, and after a verbal altercation, Ola is beaten violently by Hassan and left to die on the riverbank. Jennefer returns to Ola's apartment looking for her after having killed her boyfriend, but Ola isn't there and nobody else seems to know where she is until one of Hassan's girls Sheila admits that she saw everything and that Ola is in the hospital near death. Jennefer rushes to Ola's side where she finds Ola seeming to be comatose. She vows revenge and takes her gun to confront Hassan for what he did to Ola. She shoots him several times and  stops short of killing him and leaves the scene. Hassan is then arrested shortly after by McClaren. Jennefer returns to Ola's bedside and tells her she got revenge and that Ola can't die because she loves her. Suddenly Ola opens her eyes to look at Jennefer, seeming to be awake and Jennefer is hopeful. But then her heart monitor signals that her heartbeat flatlined and she dies. The movie ends with Jennefer packing up some keepsakes of Ola and getting on a bus for some unknown destination.  
The Bodyguard from Beijing
 The film protagonizes Allan, a professional bodyguard based in Beijing whose tactical and martial skills and quick thinking are well shown as having protected several statesmen from assassination. He is hired by James, a wealthy Hong Kong businessman, to protect his beautiful girlfriend Michelle Leung, who is the only surviving witness to a murder, after all the others had been eliminated in various ways. Allan arrives at the girl's home in Hong Kong to meet with two somewhat incompetent plainclothes police officers - Fat Po and Ken - in charge of her safety. Soon after meeting Miss Leung, he proves the entire contingent of current bodyguards incapable in his fight with them during what he thought was an assassination attempt, and they are all fired. He also disarms both policemen.  The bodyguard inspects the entire home and vehicles for bugs, bombs and layout, and installs security cameras covering various areas, including Michelle's bedroom, which he can monitor through a personal device. She is unhappy about this and, after attempting unsuccessfully to order him out, manages to knock down the camera with a frying pan. He also gives her a panic button.  During a road trip, hitmen attempt to assassinate her but fail due to Allan's strategy of having a decoy VIP car driven by Fat Po and the girl riding with him in the trailing van.  Michelle tries getting away from her bodyguard by complaining to her boyfriend and by sneaking away during the night with the younger officer, Ken, in a car. Allan reassures James and nonchalantly makes himself visible in the car's headlights as the escapees start it; Michelle has a fit as she goes back into the house.  Michelle eventually goes to the shopping mall accompanied only by the two cops. The mall, however, is staked out by operatives. One is about to murder her by firing his suppressed weapon through a stall partition, but is shot first by Allan, who had followed them and was in the stall beyond hers. This initiates a gunfight through the mall; Allan takes out multiple hitmen while shielding the girl. Eventually he realizes all the hitmen have two pens in their front pocket as identification, and poses as one to take more out. During their escape Fat Po is wounded.  One of the assassins who posed as a police officer and killed by Allan during the shoot-out is the younger brother of Killer Wong, a former Chinese soldier who fought together with his brother. Wong swears vengeance on Allan.  In the meantime, Michelle shows her attraction, which understandably had been growing since the beginning, to Allan after using her transmitter to make him storm the bedroom and "protect" her. He leaves to continue his duties, leaving her panting behind the door.  Things come to a climax when the transmitter sounds again, this time in earnest. Wong and a group of assassins storm the penthouse and start a gunfight. Both policemen and Allan rush to protect her; Ken, the younger cop, was killed by Wong himself. Allan uses his firearm and martial skills and, after darkening the room, cunningly takes out all the assailants until only Wong is left. He and Wong have a long fight, complicated by leaking gas which threatens to black both out. Eventually Wong recovers a pistol and takes the girl hostage. James arrives unawares, and attempts to dissuade Wong from shooting by offering to pay Wong, but Wong refuses. When an opportunity arrises as the assassin backs away, Allan shields Michelle with his body and takes two shots but manages to pull out a bayonet, with which he had been previously wounded, from his chest and throw it towards Wong's neck, killing him.  Before the film ends, James drives Michelle to the border between Hong Kong and mainland China as she tries to see Allan a final time before he heads back to China but guards at the checkpoint deny them entry into the mainland. However, Allan leaves Michelle with the box that held the watch she had given to him as a present and he had tried to refuse. However, when she opens it, the box contains his own watch, while Fat Po receives Allan's payment money to fund his son's school tuition. Michelle cries out Allan's name just as his car drives away from the border back into the mainland.

He spends his spare time stalking his crush, a typical girl-next-door named Kimberly. A huge fan of [[horror film]]s and [[video game]]s, Michael's only friend is a similar-minded misfit named Kyle. Kyle tells Michael about a new, ultra-realistic game called Brainscan. Intrigued, Michael sends away for the first disc.   The game begins strangely, with a warning screen informing him that the experience has much in common with hypnotic suggestion. During his first experience with the game, Michael is encouraged to act as a psychopathic murderer by the game's host, an entity known as Trickster. In-game, Michael murders a stranger and takes his foot as a trophy. Later, he is horrified to discover that his victim in the game was a real person, and that the same murder also happened in the real world.  Kyle begs Michael to let him play the game, and Michael angrily rebuffs him. Later Michael is tormented by Trickster, who exits the game and plays a song by the musical group Primus in Michael's bedroom. Because he is a possible witness to the earlier murder, Trickster tells Michael he must kill Kyle, which he eventually does in-game.   Michael doesn't remember Kyle's murder and calls his house. The phone is answered by a policeman, Detective Hayden (Frank Langella). Michael becomes paranoid that he will be sent to jail. He is also continually annoyed by the presence of Trickster, who refuses to leave his home. Trickster ultimately instructs him to kill Kimberly.  At nightfall Michael sneaks into her room, but refuses to hurt her. Trickster reveals that he is actually the evil part of Michael. He possesses Michael, the struggle of which wakes Kimberly. Kimberly tells Michael that she loves him, which allows him to break free from his own inner darkness. At the last minute, the Trickster materializes and opens the bedroom door. Detective Hayden enters and shoots Michael dead.   Michael awakens in his room. He discovers that the whole experience was a fantasy. After a short tantrum, ranting at the game for his traumatic experiences, he excitedly realizes that Kyle is still alive and that nothing in the game happened in the real world. He goes over to Kimberly's and asks her out, which she replies with "maybe" before giving him a kiss.  The next day, Michael brings the Brainscan disc to school to show as part of a horror movie marathon. Unexpectedly, Trickster appears ''before'' the disc begins to play.

Brave (1994 film)
 The movie tells the story in pictures accompanied by the entire ''Brave'' record minus "Paper Lies" and the final song "Made Again". On the recording, it is left ambiguous as to whether the main character commits suicide in the end. In the film, she does. Thus, "Made Again", which concludes the story on the record as a happy ending of sorts, is not included.  On the back of the cover of the videocassette, the description reads as follows:  :''Brave.. The Movie is a fifty-minute concept film directed by cult movie director Richard Stanley. It is Stanley's stark vision of a young life in the 90's inspired by Marillion's album of the same name, which centres around a teenage girl who is found wandering in a state of amnesia on the [[Severn Bridge]], and her consequent search for her past. Although this story bears similarities to actual recorded incidents in the history of the Severn Bridge we wish to stress that this is a work of fiction.''  On the bottom of the cover, the final lines are:  ''"Watch it loud with the lights off."''  
The Browning Version (1994 film)
 Andrew Crocker-Harris ([[Albert Finney]]) is a veteran teacher of Greek and Latin at a British Public school. After nearly 20 years of service, he is being forced to retire on the pretext of his health, and perhaps may not even be given a pension. He is disliked or ignored by the other teachers and while his pupils fear his relentlessly strict discipline, they are bored by his dictatorial but dreary and un-inspiring teaching methods. His younger wife Laura ([[Greta Scacchi]]), whom he has sexually and emotionally neglected, is unfaithful, and now lives to wound him any way she can. She is having an affair with Frank ([[Matthew Modine]]), an eager, young American science teacher who is highly popular with his pupils, much more lenient with class-room rules yet is able connect with the students. In his final class, Andrew, while reading from a Greek play, finally shows some genuine passion about the subject, giving a glimpse at the teacher he could have been. Andrew's nervous new replacement Tom ([[Julian Sands]]) expresses his awe at the ironclad control that the former exerts over his classes, but Andrew advises his young colleague not to follow his example.  As his retirement at the end of the school term draws near, Andrew is approached by a quiet and sensitive pupil named Taplow who has detected the unhappiness and loneliness of his teacher and makes an attempt to reach out to him, saying that Andrew's Latin teachings have inspired him. Taplow gives Andrew a gift- a rare copy of an early edition of the 'Browning Version'- the 1877 translation by [[Robert Browning]] of [[Aeschylus]]’ ancient play [[Agamemnon (play)|''Agamemnon'']]. Touched by this gesture, Andrew's emotional guard begins to be let down for the first time. Increasingly aware of Andrew's isolation, Frank feels guilty about the affair with Laura and ends the relationship. Shortly before the end-of-term school assembly in which Andrew will make his farewell speech, Laura tells her husband that she wants their marriage to end and that she intends to leave him.  The school's senior staff want Andrew to make his speech first, to be followed by the farewell speech of a younger, more popular teacher who is leaving to pursue a career as a cricket player. But Andrew insists on going second, even though the headmaster angrily says that it will give the ceremony an 'anti-climax'. To the surprise of everyone, including Laura who has lingered to watch the event, Andrew's speech is highly emotional and revelatory, apologising for his failures both as a teacher and as a person. Moved by the speech, the pupils and staff give Andrew a huge applause.  Andrew, as a parting gesture of gratitude, tells Taplow that he has organised a place for him in Frank's science class which the pupil had been eager to join. Laura has a newfound sense of respect for her husband and the two part on good terms. As he watches Laura drive away, Andrew sadly but calmly faces the next phase of his life.

After graduation, he is invited by his father  to sail to [[Hawaii]] aboard the ''Queen Catherine''. After annoying the limo driver who is taking him to board the boat, he is forced to walk the rest of the way.  Nathaniel makes a wrong turn into a small fishing village where he meets the imbecilic cabin boy/first mate Kenny ([[Andy Richter]]). He thinks the ship, ''The Filthy Whore'', is a theme boat. It is not until the next morning that Captain Greybar (Ritch Brinkley) finds Nathaniel in his room and explains that the boat will not return to dry land for three months.  Nathaniel unsuccessfully tries to convince each fisherman to set sail to Hawaii, but convinces Kenny into doing so. However, the crew reaches ''Hell's Bucket,'' a [[Bermuda Triangle]]-like area where weird events occur. The ship is caught in a fierce storm and Kenny is knocked overboard and drowns. Without a cabin boy, Greybar forces Nathaniel to do the chores in return for taking him to Hawaii.   The fishermen decide to give Nathaniel another chore that involves dragging him on a floating raft for a week. Nathaniel has little to eat or drink, begins consuming salt water and suffers extreme sunburn after confusing cooking oil as lotion. He also realizes he might be going insane after sighting Kenny's ghost and seeing a floating cupcake that spits tobacco. After falling into the water he is saved by a "shark-man." After nine days,  Nathaniel is pulled back in and tells what happened. It is revealed by Skunk ([[Brian Doyle-Murray]]) and Big Teddy ([[Brion James]]) that the shark-man is known as Chocki ([[Russ Tamblyn]]), the offspring of a male viking and female shark, who can be trouble because he can like one person one way, but then hate them in the other.  Nathaniel spots a beautiful young woman named Trina ([[Melora Walters]]) swimming in the ocean. After she is pulled up in a net, Nathaniel becomes smitten with her. Not pleased with another passenger on board, the fishermen decide to strand Trina and Nathaniel on the island they're sailing toward.  Finally reaching the island, the crew searches for components to fix their boat. Nathaniel tries to get closer to Trina, who constantly rejects him. Greybar and Skunk suggest to Nathaniel that a woman named Calli ([[Ann Magnuson]]) can help build his confidence. After an encounter with blue-skinned, six-armed Calli that results in his first sexual experience, Nathaniel again meets Trina, who becomes attracted to him immediately. Calli's husband Mulligan ([[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]]), a giant, comes home to find a man's bag. Realizing what Calli has done, Mulligan decides to find her lover and kill him.  Nathaniel tries to save everyone by confessing to the giant he's the one who slept with Calli. Mulligan is about to kill Nathaniel with a giant nail clipper when Chocki saves him. Nathaniel then kills Mulligan by choking him with his own belt.  Finally reaching Hawaii, Nathaniel offers his newfound companions a job at the hotel where his father is the owner. They refuse because all they know how to do is fish and stink. They tell Nathaniel he's a ''fancy lad'' who should stay in Hawaii with his dad where he belongs. Nathaniel and the fishermen part ways, including Trina. His father, William Mayweather ([[Bob Elliott (comedian)|Bob Elliott]], Chris Elliott's real-life father), expresses disappointment of his son's actions. Not wanting to live the fancy-lad life, Nathaniel leaves to find Trina, and then both join the crew on ''The Filthy Whore''.

Cemetery Man
 Francesco Dellamorte ([[Rupert Everett]]) is the cemetery caretaker in the small Italian town of Buffalora. He lives in a ramshackle house on the premises, constantly surrounded by death, with only his [[Mental retardation|mentally handicapped]] assistant Gnaghi (François Hadji-Lazaro) for company. Young punks in town spread gossip that Dellamorte is [[Erectile dysfunction|impotent]]. His hobbies are reading outdated telephone directories, in which he crosses out the names of the deceased, and trying to assemble a puzzle shaped like a human skull. Gnaghi, whose interests include spaghetti and television, can speak only one word: "Gna."  The Latin inscription over the Buffalora Cemetery gate reads ''RESURRECTURIS'' ("For those who will rise again"), and indeed, Dellamorte has had his hands full of late. Some people rise from their graves on the seventh night following their death, reanimated and ready to assault the living. Dellamorte destroys these creatures, who he calls "Returners", before they overrun the town. Buffalora's mayor (Stefano Masciarelli) is so fixated on his campaigning that he seems unable even to hear Dellamorte's pleas for an investigation. In any event, being an outcast in the village and almost illiterate, Dellamorte doesn't want to lose the job. He opens up to his only friend, Franco, a municipal clerk, but doesn't file the paperwork necessary to get assistance: "It's easier just to shoot them."  At a funeral, Dellamorte falls hard and fast in love, with the unnamed young widow ([[Anna Falchi]]) of a rich, elderly man. The widow only begins to show an interest when Dellamorte tells her about the [[ossuary]], which she adores. While consummating their relationship by her husband's grave, the husband returns, attacks, and bites her. She seems to die from the bite, but the coroner claims it was a heart attack. Fearing the worst, Dellamorte stays near her corpse, and shoots her when she rises.  Gnaghi becomes infatuated with the mayor's capricious daughter, Valentina (Fabiana Formica). This would seem to end tragically when she is decapitated in a motorcycle accident. Instead, Gnaghi digs up her reanimated head, and an innocent romance begins. The young widow also rises again, causing Dellamorte to believe that she was [[Suspended animation|not really a zombie]] when he first shot her, in which case it was he who killed her. He plummets into a depression and is visited by the leering figure of [[Death (personification)|Death]], who tells him to "Stop killing the dead", asking him why he doesn't shoot the living instead.  Dellamorte encounters two more unnamed women, also played by Falchi. He goes to outrageous ends to be with the first of these, an assistant to the new mayor: when the object of his affection says she is terrified of sexual penetration, Dellamorte pretends that the rumour about his impotence is correct, and visits a doctor to have his penis removed. The doctor talks him out of it, giving him an injection for temporary impotence instead. Meanwhile, the woman has been raped by her employer, and then fallen in love with her rapist, discarding both her phobia and the cemetery man.  His grip on reality slipping, Dellamorte heads into town at night with his revolver, shooting the young men who have made fun of him for years due to his rumored impotence. He meets a third manifestation of the woman he loves, but upon finding out that she is a prostitute, he kills her and two other women by setting their house on fire with a room heater. His friend Franco [[Anton Alexander (actor)|(Anton Alexander]]) is accused of these murders after killing his wife and child, and attempts suicide the same night by drinking a bottle of iodine. Dellamorte goes to visit his friend in the hospital, to find out why Franco stole his murders. Sitting by the hospital bed, he casually murders a nun, a nurse, and a doctor. Franco doesn't even recognize him, so even these acts fail to change Dellamorte's situation. He screams out a confession, but is ignored.  Gnaghi and Dellamorte pack up the car, and head for the Buffalora city limits and the mountains beyond. Gnaghi's head is injured when Dellamorte slams on the brakes. They get out of the vehicle and walk to the edge of the road, where it drops into a chasm. Gnaghi begins to seize, and collapses to the ground. Dellamorte, realizing that the rest of the world doesn't exist and fearing that his assistant is dead or dying, loads a gun with two dum-dum bullets to finish them both off. Gnaghi wakes up and drops Dellamorte's gun off the cliff. He then asks to be taken home, speaking clearly. Dellamorte replies: "Gna."  
Camp Nowhere
 Morris "Mud" Himmel has a problem: his parents want to send him away to a [[summer]] [[Tech camp|computer camp]]. He hates going to [[summer camp]], and would do anything to get out of it. Talking to his friends, he realizes that they are all facing the same sentence of going to a boring summer camp. Together with them, he hatches a plan to create their own summer camp with no parents, no [[School counselor|counselor]]s, and no rules. Word gets out and other kids want to join the made up summer camp. Mud decides to [[blackmail]] former drama teacher Dennis Van Welker into helping; he had bought an [[AMC Gremlin]] and failed to make most of the payments and is being pursued by soon-to-retire collector T.R. Polk, and agrees to help them in return for $1,000 and after they threaten to turn him in if he doesn't help.  With Dennis' help, the kids trick all the parents into sending them to the camp, and then rent an old campground (that used to be a hippie [[commune]] back in the 1960s and 1970s.) with a cabin on a lake. Some parents believe it is a computer camp, while others believe it is a [[fat camp]], [[military camp]], or an acting camp. The kids use the money their parents had paid for camp to buy toys and food. After a little while, they get bored and wonder if they should just return home. Mud goes to Dennis for help, and with a [[bribe]], he soon finds ways to keep things interesting and help them continue to have fun.  Eventually, the parents want to come visit their kids, despite being told that there are no parents' days. Mud makes a plan to trick them and, along with his friends, they keep the camp concealed. In a matter of hours, they fix it up and set up different scenarios representing the different camps (fat camp, computer camp, military camp, etc.) Their plan works and the parents don't suspect a thing. T.R. Polk then meets a [[state trooper]] who was also seeking Dennis, and they find their way into the camp and catch him. The [[police]] are called and Mud finds Dennis running away from the [[authorities]]. Mud is confronted by the police and protects Dennis from them, but soon after Dennis turns himself in. Mud confesses and explains that the whole thing was his idea, and uses the rest of the money to settle Dennis' debt with T.R. Polk, who'll retire with a perfect record. The other kids in a show of solidarity also claim responsibility and therefore all the parents refuse to press charges. Dennis gets off the hook and the kids leave for home, having had the greatest summer of their lives.

  Two 12-year-old girls, Charlotte "Charlie" Palfy from [[Berlin]] and Louise Kröger from [[Hamburg]], meet on a train going to a language school in [[Scotland]]. They are shocked to see how much they look alike. They soon find out they are [[identical twins]]. Shortly after their birth, their parents split up, and each of them took one girl. Neither girl knew she had a twin sister, and they both believed their other parent was dead.  Though they look alike, they are very different in personality. Charlie, as the daughter of a music hall composer, is cool, self-confident, and somewhat impolite, dresses accordingly, and listens to [[Techno Music|techno music]]. Louise, who grew up with her mother, who works in advertising, wears conservative clothing and is rather shy and quiet.  The two girls concoct a plan to find out why they were separated by their parents. Charlie travels to their mother in Hamburg, pretending to be Louise, who in turn pretends to be Charlie and travels to their father in Berlin. Much chaos ensues as both girls try to settle into their new lives without anyone noticing the difference.

Chasers
  Eddie Devane ([[William McNamara]]) is a young sailor who has carried out a number of inventory-related scams along with his partner-in-crime Howard ([[Crispin Glover]]) and made a lot of money during his service. A day before his discharge, Eddie is assigned to escort a prisoner from the Marine base at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]] along with the authoritarian, no-nonsense [[Chief Petty Officer]] Rock Reilly ([[Tom Berenger]]). Eddie is of course not pleased with this development. When Howard sees a grumpy-looking Eddie being escorted from his superior's office by a couple of other seaman, he thinks Eddie has been found out and arrested for his scams. In order to destroy evidence, he goes to Eddie's desk and finds the money, the existence of which Eddie had concealed from him.  Eddie and Rock's personalities clash many times during the trip to Camp Lejeune. When they reach their destination, they discover that the prisoner they are transporting is a pretty young woman, Toni Johnson ([[Erika Eleniak]]). However, they soon discover that taking her back is no easy job when she attempts to escape disguised as a waitress at a diner but is caught. Later, she feigns the onset of her period and puts tampons inside the van's gas tank which leads to the van being stalled in the road. While walking, the trio come across an abandoned mine and accidentally fall down the shaft. They try to get out standing on each other's shoulders. Toni gets out first, ditches them and runs away but has a change of heart later and comes back for them.  They stay for the night in a motel while their van is being repaired. They converse and bond in a diner where it is revealed that Rock is divorced from his wife and estranged from his son, and Toni had first gone AWOL to visit her delinquent, drug-addicted brother in a hospital. When the authorities attempted to arrest her, she resisted and made more attempts to escape, leading to her current sentence. Her brother died while she was in prison. This makes them see her in a new light and understand the motivations behind her actions. Later in the night, Eddie finds out that Howard has taken all the money as well as the new car Eddie was planning to buy. He calls Howard, who says he was tired of being used, but says if Eddie answers a riddle he will turn around: "How do you talk to the fish?", which Eddie cannot answer. Unbeknownst to them, Toni listens to their conversation on another receiver, and realizes he embezzled $150,000 from the Navy. Distressed, he gets drunk. When he returns to the motel, Toni seduces him, and the two have sex.  Next morning, Eddie wakes up and sees Toni run away. She steals the car of the man who picked her up (director [[Dennis Hopper]] in a cameo). While giving her chase, Eddie and Rock's van accidentally climbs up an artificial volcano in an amusement park and falls down but they both escape unhurt. They catch up with Toni only to discover that her brother's funeral is soon and she is running away with the intention of being present there. Frustrated with the situation, Rock and Eddie have a fistfight. The three then go to a bar, where Toni apologizes to Eddie for fleeing that morning and mentions "Drop them a line", answering Howard's riddle, revealing she had accidentally listened in on the conversation; she then brokers a reconciliation between Eddie and Rock. They journey to their base and hand Toni over.  Eddie realizes that he is in love with Toni and wants to rescue her. Rock is of agreement. When Toni is being transported to the prison to begin her sentence, Eddie and Rock sabotage the van in the same way as she had sabotaged their van earlier. Eddie impersonates a tow truck driver and takes the van away, only for the drivers to realize too late Toni is inside.  In the epilogue set one year later, Eddie and Toni are living it up "somewhere south of the border," and Rock, now retired from the Navy, has begun a relationship with a waitress he met at the diner before.

China Moon
  The story opens with detectives Kyle Bodine and Lamar Dickey investigating a murder scene. Bodine tutors Dickey in the ways of homicide investigations, stressing that all murderers make stupid mistakes, which is how they get caught.  At a local bar, Bodine hits on Rachel Munro, who blows him off. Rachel is married to wealthy banker Rupert Munro. Back at home, she gets drunk as she looks at a private investigator's photos of Rupert making love to one of his employees, Adele. Rupert is intimidating and emotionally abusive towards Rachel, who decides to give in to Kyle's advances and start an affair with him.  At one point, the lovers row out on a lake at night. Kyle points out the large full moon and says that his grandmother called it a China Moon, because it looks like a giant china dish. His grandmother thought a China Moon made people do crazy things. Their affair quickly picks up steam, and Kyle urges Rachel to divorce Rupert.  Soon after, Kyle and Lamar are called to the Munro's on a domestic disturbance complaint. They find Rachel badly beaten. Kyle warns Rupert to leave her alone. Later that night, Rachel drives to Kyle's trailer and fantasizes about killing Rupert. She explains that she has bought a [[9mm]] gun. She says that she could take a trip to Miami, drive back one night and kill him. Then she could return to her trip unseen, using it as an alibi. Kyle tries to talk her down, but she flees in a panic.  Rachel arrives at a hotel in Miami, and the concierge hands her an envelope which contains the picture of a rental car and its keys. Later, she leaves the hotel at night, without noticing Adele sitting in the lobby. She gets in the rental car and drives back to her home. Meanwhile, Adele enters her hotel room.  Instead of driving home, Rachel drives to Kyle's trailer, and he agrees to drive her home to get her things. He waits in the car as she packs a suitcase. Kyle does not see Rupert returning home, and when Rupert encounters Rachel in the act of leaving him, he flies into a rage. She gets her 9mm gun and shoots him twice in self-defense. She stops Kyle from calling the police because she points out that she drove back from Miami without checking out of her hotel, just like her murder fantasy. She knows she would look guilty, and Kyle agrees to help her cover her tracks. Using his skills as a homicide detective, he helps her carefully clear the crime scene, even removing the bullets from the wall, spackling over the holes and painting them. They dump Rupert's body in the same lake where they first made love. Back at the house, Kyle turns on the humidifiers to erase any of his fingerprints.  Rachel returns to the hotel in Miami and has brunch by the pool the next morning. When she returns home, she sticks to Kyle's plan and calls Rupert's bank. Rupert's secretary informs Rachel that he has not been in to work, and Rachel reports him missing to the police. Kyle and Lamar are assigned to the case. During their interviews with Rachel, Lamar is highly skeptical of her story, pointing out all its inconsistencies. As they shoot the breeze at Rachel's house, Lamar casually hypothesizes that Rachel killed Rupert with the help of one of her many boyfriends. He tells Kyle that Rachel is well known for wrapping men around her finger, and that, with the millions she would inherit from Rupert, it was highly likely that she got one of her boyfriends to help her kill Rupert and dispose of his body. Lamar starts to unnerve Kyle, who begins to doubt Rachel is telling him the truth.  Lamar gets a tip about a car being out at the lake on the night of the murder. The police divers find Rupert's body. During the autopsy, the coroner extracts a bullet from Rupert's chest. Lamar takes the bullet and hands it to Kyle, saying that it looks like a [[.38 ACP|.38]]. The detectives confirm that it is a .38, which is the caliber of gun that Kyle carries. During his first date with Rachel, she had inquired about the caliber of his gun.  Back at the Munro house, Kyle discovers the photos of Rupert and Adele in Rachel's wardrobe. The crime scene technician discovers a bullet hole in the wall, and the extracted bullet is also a .38. Kyle is summoned to a meeting with his supervisor, who suspends him pending an investigation into his involvement with the case. He orders Kyle to surrender his pistol.  Later that day, Lamar arrives at Kyle's trailer and asks him to come in for some more questioning. The pistol he surrendered did not match the serial number on his service weapon. Sitting in the back seat of Lamar's car, Kyle fixates on a [[compass]] that sits on Lamar's dashboard. After a second, more forceful interrogation with his supervisor and Lamar, Kyle returns home and re-examines the pictures he discovered at Rachel's. He identifies Lamar's dashboard compass in the bottom of the frame of one of the pictures.  Adele meets with Lamar, and he pays her for her part in the scheme, after she shows him a ticket to prove that she is leaving town. He promises to pay her the rest of her share once he has received his cut. Kyle sneaks into Rachel's house and confronts her about the scheme. She confesses that Rupert was going to leave her with nothing, and that Lamar had concocted the scheme to make sure she inherited all of Rupert's fortune. She swears that, despite the fact that Lamar had designated Kyle as the fall guy, she had fallen in love with him.  Kyle orders her to set up a meeting with Lamar at the bar where they met. At the bar, Kyle confronts Lamar. He confirms that Lamar had switched out the 9mm bullet for a .38 during the coroner inquest. He asks Lamar where his service revolver is, and Lamar says it is in his car. Kyle forces Lamar out to his car at gunpoint to retrieve the .38. The bartender sees Kyle's gun at Lamar's back and calls the police. They arrive as Kyle is searching for his pistol underneath the driver's seat in Lamar's car. Lamar calls out to the police that Kyle has a gun, and they open fire, killing Kyle. A distraught Rachel runs over to Kyle as he lies dying. She picks up the .38 and kills Lamar.

Cinderella (1994 film)
 A wealthy and kind-hearted gentleman has all he could ever ask for: a loving wife and a most beautiful daughter who was kind and gentle. The three of them live happily in an opulent mansion on a hill overlooking the town. Life, however, is not always predictable and the man's wife died, leaving the man a widower and his daughter without a mother. A year later the man marries once again with a new woman, who brings along her two plain-looking, socially awkward daughters who, along with their mother, possess cruel and selfish hearts. They resent the man's girl for her beauty and her kind nature.  When the man leaves on a business trip, the woman and her two daughters turn on the poor girl, forcing her into a life of drudgery and hard work. They kick her out of her own room and make her sleep on a straw mat in the kitchen, force her into wearing rags and wait on them hand and foot. As she sleeps by the fireside, she is constantly covered in ashes from the hearth and the Stepmother and her two daughters nickname the girl, "Cinderella."  However, Cinderella realizes she has a [[Fairy Godmother]] living in the snowglobe in her kitchen. Life turns around for the girl the day a grand ball is announced in which the prince will choose his bride. The Stepmother and her two daughters are invited, and the Stepmother takes her two daughters into town to buy them new gowns. Cinderella wishes to go, but the Stepmother refuses and orders her to help her daughters prepare for the ball. Once the two Stepsisters are ready, Cinderella asks again to go to the ball, but the Stepmother refuses, unless Cinderella can sort a dish of lentils before they depart. With the help of her Fairy Godmother, she almost succeeds, but the Stepmother finds one lentil on the floor and refuses to allow Cinderella to go with them to the ball. After her Stepmother and her two Stepsisters abandon her, Cinderella is provided with a magnificent gown and a glittering coach and sets off for the ball, with a warning from the Fairy Godmother to leave before midnight or else the magic will cease and everything will return to normal. Cinderella attends the ball and wins the heart of the Prince, who up until then had refused to wed until he found a woman he truly loved. When midnight strikes, Cinderella flees through the palace gardens, leaving one glass slipper behind in the rush.

La Cité de la peur
 ===First day of the festival=== The film opens with the last minutes of ''Red is Dead''. In their bloody house, Sandy ([[Hélène de Fougerolles|de Fougerolles]]) and Ben (Farrugia) congratulate themselves on their defeat of Youri, the [[communist]] killer who murdered their entire family, and who is now lying on the floor, apparently dead.  Sandy goes to have a bath while Ben cleans the house in preparation for a dinner they have tonight. When Sandy comes out of the bathroom, she is attacked by a very alive Youri. Ben tries to protect her and accidentally kills her. He rushes out of the house and struggles to find the keys to open his [[Convertible|convertible car]]. When he finally succeeds, the killer is only a few feet away from him. Ben, however, remembers with horror that he has forgotten to turn the [[vacuum cleaner]] off, and runs back to the house, knocking Youri into a conveniently placed [[petroleum]] puddle with the car door. After turning the vacuum cleaner off, he runs back to the car, where a phone call warns him that Youri is standing behind him. Ben fights Youri with his car phone, and manages to send him back into the puddle before setting it on fire.  After Ben drives into the sunset, Youri triumphantly emerges from the puddle and the [[end credits]] roll.   In the theater, Odile Deray asks the viewers what they thought. Everybody leaves without a word, and she chases after a [[movie critic|critic]] and pleads with him to write a favorable article. He refuses on the grounds that the movie is "utter crap". We learn that Odile is the publicist for the movie, and that today is the first day of the [[Cannes film festival]]. Odile visits the projectionist ([[Tchéky Karyo|Karyo]]) and briefly talks with him while he argues on the phone with his wife. After Odile leaves, the projectionist is murdered by a hammer and sickle wielding killer.  ===Second day of the festival=== Odile is talking with the projectionist's widow ([[Valérie Lemercier|Lemercier]]). While the widow mourns her husband and reminisces their last argument, Odile realizes she can use the murder for publicity, and decides to bring the film's star to the festival, and to hire a bodyguard.   In a hotel room, a man watches the news on television. A deputy was murdered, and the main suspect is a politician called Jean-Paul Martoni. When the projectionist's murder is brought up, the man turns the TV off.   In [[Paris]], Serge Karamazov unsuccessfully tries to talk his boss's secretary into letting him sleep with her. She ignores him and tells him to go in to talk to his boss. While playing various sports, Karamazov's boss reminds him that his job description does not include having sex with his clients, and instructs him to go to [[Cannes]] to protect Simon Jérémi, ''Red is Dead'''s main star.  At the [[Nice]] airport, Karamazov meets Odile, and the two see Simon arrive, wielding a balloon and a nametag, and accompanied by a stewardess. Once in the car, Odile tells Simon of all the exciting things he is going to do in Cannes, prompting Simon to throw up. He explains that he throws up whenever he is really happy. While Karamazov and Simon get to the Martinez hotel and are taken to their room, a second projectionist ([[Daniel Gélin|Gélin]]) is murdered in the same fashion as the first one.  In the projection room, Odile discovers the body and calls the police. Commissaire Bialès soon arrives and is introduced by a short documentary movie about his life thus far. Simon and Karamazov arrive at the scene. Karamazov tells a police officer of his frustration at having to babysit Simon, and Simon, excited to see a [[Kinoton]] [[movie projector]], throws up. Bialès wonders about the meaning of the letters found carved on the wall after both murders, an O and a D, and concludes that they spell "[[Major scale|do]]", leading him to believe that the killer is a musician.   At the police headquarters, Odile is being interrogated in a scene parodying ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (instead of smoking, Odile is eating [[sauerkraut]]). As Commissaire Bialès tells Odile of his suspicion that she planned the murders as a [[publicity stunt]], another policeman comes in with a new piece of information: he found a piece of fabric on the scene of the crime.  Back in the unnamed man's hotel room, the man is once again watching the news, and as he passes in front of a mirror, his face is revealed.  ===Third day of the festival=== At the Martinez, Odile instructs Karamazov and Simon to hurry and get ready for the [[press conference]], which starts in an hour. Upon realizing that Simon doesn't have anything to wear, Odile and Karamazov take him shopping in an obvious ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' parody.   Later, at the press conference, Odile scolds two women who are loudly gossiping, and the projection starts.  Meanwhile, Karamazov is in the projection room to protect the projectionist ([[Jean-Pierre Bacri|Bacri]]) against the killer. Karamazov, however, has [[food poisoning]], and is passing foul gas, which prompts the projectionist to send him away to the bathroom. On his way, Karamazov meets an old flame, and they make awkward small talk. In the projection room, the projectionist is murdered.  Karamazov sees the killer run away, and chases after him. However, he is stopped by a group of [[mime artist|mime]]s protesting against [[sound film]]s, and the killer gets away.  ===Fourth day of the festival=== Odile is making preparations for the next projection, while Karamazov demonstrates his new hi-tech [[metal detector]] and Simon tries on outfits. Everybody gathers around the TV when a report about ''Red is Dead'' is shown on the news. It features an interview of Odile and Simon at a party held in the honour of the murdered projectionists, during which Simon, once again, throws up.   Later, at the Martinez, Odile meets Bialès for dinner. Odile talks about her life before ''Red is Dead'', and as [[sexual tension]] quickly builds up between the two, they leave for Bialès's apartment.  At a night club, Simon finds Karamazov completely drunk and ranting about his inability to seduce Odile.  Meanwhile, at Bialès's apartment, the two have just had sex, and Odile accidentally discovers the killer's costume in a wardrobe. Horrified, she rushes to the night club, where she finds Karamazov enthusiastically insulting her.   The next scene starts with a disclaimer stating that, because of budgetary limits, it will be entirely [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by the crew, including [[sound effect]]s. Amidst arguments and chit chat by the dubbers, the fourth projectionist ([[Eddy Mitchell|Mitchell]]) is killed, and the killer accidentally cuts his own finger. Another disclaimer then informs the viewer that the dubbed scene is over.  ===Fifth and last day of the festival=== At the hotel's restaurant, Odile is briefing Simon about his scheduled interviews. Karamazov arrives, and Odile tells him she has found the next projectionist, who will be joining them. They argue about Karamazov's behaviour in the night club, and Odile reveals that she thinks Bialès is the murderer. Karamazov muses about the letters left by the killer: they are now O, D, I and L. Karamazov wonders if it spells [[Le Lido|Lido]], and theorizes that the killer may be a [[cabaret]] dancer. He then proceeds to explain that the murderer is probably a [[serial killer]], and that he has designed a giant [[mousetrap]] to catch him.   His explanations are interrupted by the arrival of the new projectionist, the unnamed man who was seen watching the news all throughout the movie: it's Émile Gravier ([[Sam Karmann|Karmann]]), an old friend of Odile's. The camera dramatically zooms on Émile's finger, which is wrapped in a bandage.  Odile and Émile reminisce about their youth, the latter much more enthusiastically than the former.   Later, the awards ceremony is about to start, and Odile, Karamazov, Simon and Émile are in a [[Limousine]], getting ready to climb the famous stairs to the Palais des festivals. Odile offers Émile chewing gum, which prompts him to remember, in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], the way Odile always neglected him for her boyfriends, while he was secretly in love with her.  The four get out of the car and make their way up the stairs. Suddenly, Jean-Paul Martoni, who has been convicted of the deputy's murder, arrives and, threatening the crowd with a gun, runs into the building. Émile, under enormous stress, passes out.   Once inside, Odile panics about Émile's inconsciousness, which leaves her with no projectionist. Simon reveals that he can project ''Red is Dead'', having been trained as a projectionist, and adds "because, you see, I'm not really an actor!".  While Simon prepares to start projecting the movie, the crowd is getting impatient. Odile instructs Karamazov to distract them, and he and Bialès launch in an "improvised" musical number about the [[Carioca (dance)|Carioca]], which the public loves.  The movie starts playing, and they get off the stage. Bialès is reminded of Martoni's presence inside the building, and goes after him.   In the projection room, Simon is attacked by Émile, who reveals that he killed all the previous projectionists in an attempt to get Odile's attention. After Simon offers Émile some chewing gum, the two struggle and knock the projector around. In the theater, Odile is horrified to notice that the wrong reel has been launched, and instructs Karamazov to go check on Simon. Karamazov finds Émile and Simon in a struggle, and exclaims "Simon, so it was you all along! I knew it!", letting Émile escape. A frustrated Simon explains that Émile is the killer.

Clerks
 Dante Hicks, a 22-year-old [[retail clerk]] at the Quick Stop [[convenience store]] in [[Leonardo, New Jersey]], is called into work on his day off by his boss to cover a few hours for another employee who is sick. Arriving at the store, he finds that the locks to the security shutters are jammed closed with chewing gum, so he hangs a sheet over them with a message written in shoe polish: "I ASSURE YOU; WE'RE OPEN."  Dante's day is spent in the hell of serving a succession of customers while repeating the fact that he is "not even supposed to be here today". Stressed with the demands of his job, Dante passes time in wide-ranging conversations with his best friend, Randal Graves. Randal is an irresponsible slacker who works in the next-door video store, RST Video, although he spends most of the day at the Quick Stop, neglecting the video store's customers. They converse about many things to pass time, such as whether or not the contractors working on the second [[Death Star]] when it was destroyed at the end of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' were innocent victims. Other events of the day include the discovery that Dante's high school girlfriend, Caitlin Bree, with whom he has been having early morning phone conversations, is engaged to be married. Dante's current girlfriend, Veronica Loughran, also stops in to bring him homemade [[lasagna]]. The two talk about Dante's stuck-in-a-rut lifestyle with no motivation to change before having an argument about her past sexual partners.  Learning that he is stuck working the store all day, as his boss went to [[Vermont]], Dante convinces his friends to play [[hockey]] on the store roof, though the game is cut short; twelve minutes in, an enraged customer shoots their only ball off the roof and into a sewer. Reopening the store, Dante finds another of his ex-girlfriends has died and her [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] is today. Randal talks him into closing the store again and going to the wake. The visit is catastrophic, with Randal and Dante running out to escape in their car. What happened inside the funeral home is not shown, but a subsequent conversation between the two reveals that Randal accidentally knocked over the casket by leaning on it.  That night, Caitlin surprises Dante with a visit. After she assures Dante that the engagement announcement was premature and arranged by her mother, the two trade banter and Dante becomes torn between her and Veronica. He finally decides to take Caitlin on a date and goes home to change. He returns to discover that Caitlin had sex with a dead man in the unlit bathroom, having mistaken the man for Dante (the man had earlier entered the bathroom with a pornographic magazine and had suffered a fatal [[heart attack]] while [[Masturbation|masturbating]]). An ambulance takes a catatonic Caitlin away along with the man's body.  [[Jay and Silent Bob]], a pair of [[slackers]] who have spent all day loitering (and dealing [[marijuana]]) outside RST Video, enter the Quick Stop to shoplift. Dante turns down Jay's offer to party with them. Aware of Dante's problem, Silent Bob pauses before following Jay outside and offers the following wisdom: "You know, there's a million fine-looking women in the world, dude. But they don't all bring you lasagna at work. Most of 'em just cheat on you." Dante then realizes that he loves Veronica. When she returns to the Quick Stop, however, Randal complicates things by revealing that Dante asked Caitlin out. Veronica angrily breaks up with Dante, telling him that Randal informed her of the planned date with Caitlin.  When Randal enters the Quick Stop after closing RST, Dante attacks him and the two fight, making a mess of the store. Afterward, they lie on the floor exhausted. Dante claims that Randal does nothing for him but make his life miserable by getting him fined, offending his customers, and ruining his relationship. Randal loses his temper and verbally explodes, saying that Dante deserves the blame, as Dante, closed the store to play hockey, closed it again to go to the wake, and closed it yet again to try to hook up with his ex-girlfriend, cheating on his current one in the process. He then says that Dante came to work of his own free will and "overcompensates for having a monkey's job". He claims Dante thinks he is more advanced than the customers and storms off with "if we're so fucking advanced, what are we doing working here?" leaving Dante speechless on the floor.  They reconcile and Dante says he will try to talk to Veronica, visit Caitlin, and possibly get some direction in his life. The film ends with Randal walking out of the store, popping back in briefly to toss Dante's sign at him stating, "You're closed!"<ref>Kevin Smith. ''Clerks and Chasing Amy : Two Screenplays''.

The President tells James Cutter, his [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], that Colombian drug cartels represent a "[[clear and present danger]]" to the U.S., indirectly giving him unofficial permission to kill the men responsible for his friend's murder.

City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold
 A year after the events of the first film, Mitch Robbins ([[Billy Crystal]]) is a much happier and livelier man, having moved out of the city and become station manager at the radio station where he works, where he has employed his best friend, Phil Berquist ([[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]]). However, he is being plagued with nightmares about his deceased friend, Curly, and comes to believe that he may still be alive. On his 40th birthday, Mitch sees a man resembling Curly on the train, which does nothing to placate his worries, and later finds a treasure map belonging to Lincoln Washburn hidden in Curly's old hat, albeit with a missing corner. He and Phil investigate the contents of the map in the library and learn that Lincoln was Curly's father and a train robber in the Old West who in 1908 infamously stole and hid one million dollars in gold bullion in the deserts near [[Las Vegas]]. With an impending trip to Las Vegas for a convention, Mitch decides to venture out to find the gold (which would now be worth twenty million) along with Phil and his estranged older brother, Glen ([[Jon Lovitz]]).  Several mishaps ensue, such as Glen accidentally burning a hole in the map with a magnifying glass, Mitch almost falling off a cliff while retrieving it and Phil believing he was bitten by a rattlesnake while he actually sat on a cactus. They are ambushed by the two cowboys who they bought their supplies from, who demand the map, since Phil recklessly told them all about the gold. Just as they are poised to kill them, the man resembling Curly appears and fights them off. He introduces himself as Duke ([[Jack Palance]]), Curly's identical twin brother, and explains that long ago, their father had plans to find the gold with his sons once he was no longer being monitored, but he died before. On her death bed, their mother gave Curly the map, and he contacted Duke to find him so that they could find the gold together, but he died on the cattle drive the previous year. Duke learned from Cookie that Mitch had Curly's belongings, and so sought him out, though Mitch believed he was Curly. Though Duke is prepared to take the map and find the gold by himself, Mitch chastises him for his attitude, reasoning that Curly would not approve. Out of respect for Curly, Duke relents and allows the others to accompany him and share the gold.  A reckless act by Mitch causes a stampede in which the map and almost all their supplies are lost. Thanks to Glen's memory, they are able to press on and find the location of the cave where the gold is hidden. They eventually find it, but are confronted by two armed cowboys also seeking it. In the ensuing fight, Glen is shot, but Duke discovers the bullets to be blanks with red paint pellets. At that moment, Clay Stone ([[Noble Willingham]]), the organizer of the cattle drive, appears along with some of their old friends, such as Ira and Barry Shalowitz. Clay explains that the cowboys are his sons and he has been looking for Duke for some time. Having left the cattle business, he is now making a living taking men on a trip to find the gold, which is revealed to be lead bars painted gold. Though Mitch, Phil, and Glen feel lost, Duke remains convinced that the gold is out there somewhere, and stays behind as the others return to Las Vegas.  Mitch is visited by Duke in his hotel room, who reveals that the entire time, he knew where the gold truly was and intended to keep it all for himself, but couldn't bring himself to do so, having found his one thing to be honesty Through Mitch's skepticism, Duke reveals that he had the missing corner of the map, which points to where Lincoln reburied the gold in 1909, and presents a bar of it to Mitch as a gift. He tries to scratch the gold off with a knife, and screams in joy upon realizing that it is real after all.  
Clifford (film)
 At a [[Catholic school]] in 2050, a troublesome boy named Roger ([[Ben Savage]]) is running away after threatening to blow up the gym due to not being allowed to play on the basketball team – though he was accepted onto the team his parents have strictly forbidden contact sports. He's stopped by Father Clifford Daniels ([[Martin Short]]), an old priest, who tries to persuade him to change his ways by telling him a story of his own youth, stating that "when we get frustrated, it can cause a lot of damage".  In the [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], 10-year-old Clifford is a deceptive, sneaky, devious, obnoxious, evil, and unusual boy who never lets go of a toy [[dinosaur]] named Stephan. He talks to and blames Stephan for his own actions.  He loves dinosaurs and his dream is to visit Dinosaur World, a [[theme park]] in [[California]], but he's never considered, especially by his workaholic parents Julian ([[Richard Kind]]) and Theodora ([[Jennifer Savidge]]).  While flying with his parents to [[Honolulu]] on a business trip, Clifford purposely causes the pilot to make an emergency landing in [[Los Angeles]]. Because Clifford is banned from flight and so is his family, Julian scolds him as he can't attend the appointment but also can't abandon Clifford in the city without risking [[child abandonment]] charges. He phones his brother, Martin ([[Charles Grodin]]) — who resides in the city — to propose the idea of Clifford staying with him temporarily.  While Clifford sees this as his opportunity to finally visit Dinosaur World, Martin thinks that this is the perfect opportunity to prove to his fiancee, Sarah Davis ([[Mary Steenburgen]]), how well he interacts with children. However, he has not seen Clifford since his [[baptism]], and thus is completely unaware of Clifford's potential for hazardous antics.  Upon their reunion, Martin reveals to Clifford that he designed Larry the Scary Rex (a Dinosaur World attraction) and can get into the park free of charge, which strengthens Clifford's obsession to visit. Martin promises to take him there, but is ultimately forced to break it as his work demands him to redesign LA's public transit system - one of Martin's biggest dreams - in two days.  Clifford even attempts to sneak away by posing as someone else's son, in a dinosaur costume, but he's caught by Martin, and Martin is disappointed in Clifford. He [[Punishment|grounds]] Clifford with no trips to Dinosaur World and sends him up to his room to think about everything he has done.  Clifford becomes enraged at Martin's promise break (Even more when he discovers that while Martin won't take him to Dinosaur World, he ''can'' spare time for Sarah's parents' 35th wedding anniversary party), and thus starts working to sabotage Martin's life, jeopardizing his career and even his relationship with Sarah in the process. He compliments Martin's boss, Gerald Ellis ([[Dabney Coleman]]), on his [[toupee]], humiliates Martin at the party by putting [[Tabasco sauce]] in his [[Bloody Mary (cocktail)|Bloody Mary]] drink, ruining an unprepared toast that Martin is giving, and even switches his cocoa butter with lipstick, making a comedic scene.  Clifford finally gets Martin arrested in front of Sarah's family after calling in a fake bomb threat in city hall, made out of mixing audios of Martin's scolding of Clifford with his answering machine.  As he's released on bail, Martin scolds Clifford again, but tries reasoning with him, trying to share Martin's own experiences of being denied his own visit to an old theme park before it was ultimately demolished.  He tries getting Clifford to write a confession of the bomb incident, but Clifford seems to have run away to catch a train to San Francisco, where Sarah travels per Mr. Ellis' request (later revealed as an attempt by Ellis to try moving in on her).  Martin tries giving chase, but can't find him before the train starts running with him inside.  Smiling, Clifford returns to Martin's home, where he throws a juvenile party in exchange for his trip to Dinosaur World.  Martin gradually snaps out of his sanity, perceiving Clifford as a threat, and when he returns home, he traps Clifford (who tries making a scene by pretending he's tied up) by boarding doors and windows.  Clifford is released next morning by Sarah, who breaks up with Martin in disgust, taking Clifford with her.  As Martin arrives late to Ellis's presentation of Martin's transit system, the Los Angeles city model explodes, costing Martin his job - the last of Clifford's antics.  Having had enough, Martin decides it is his duty to humanity to kill Clifford. He kidnaps Clifford and finally takes him to Dinosaur World after closing hours and makes him ride Larry the Scary Rex.  After going through it once, Clifford seems to enjoy himself, so Martin increases the ride's speed repeatedly. When set to hyper speed, the ride malfunctions and Clifford's cart crashes, leaving him dangling above the jaws of the malfunctioning robotic dinosaur. He cries out for Martin to save him.  Martin hesitates — worried about the future of mankind if he saves Clifford and fact that Clifford has so completely ruined his life — but ultimately, he risks his own life and saves him instead. Clifford finally apologizes for his behavior, but Martin doesn't forgive him, telling Clifford he's not human, but a 'destructive thing people eventually get to hate'. Though it doesn't look like it, Clifford is heartbroken, and decides not to go home with Martin.  Back in the future, Father Clifford says that this experience made him turn his life around, telling Roger that "if you destroy everyone in the way of your dreams, you will end up alone, with no dreams at all." Eventually, Martin invited him to his and Sarah's wedding, finally forgiving him after Clifford sent over two hundred letters of apology.  Moved by the tale, Roger decides to not run away and instead write hundreds of letters, asking for forgiveness. Father Clifford then takes Stephan saying, "Mission accomplished, old friend."  
Clean Slate (1994 film)
 Maurice Pogue has [[retrograde amnesia]], a form of amnesia that prevents him from remembering anything that happened to him the day before. He realizes from a recording he made for himself the previous night (Sunday) – to keep himself in the know – that he's a private investigator in [[Los Angeles]], and acquired the condition after being injured during a case. Pogue tells himself not to reveal his condition to anyone, as he's the key witness in the case against the man responsible for his amnesia. Appearing on the recording is a strange woman, Sarah Novak, who informs him she has been living under the alias Beth Holly in San Francisco, and she has come to L.A. because she is being blackmailed. The police then come to Pogue's office, and take him to what turns out to be his birthday party. He tells his friend Dolby that he's seen Sarah, and learns from Dolby that Sarah is dead. While at the party, Pogue also meets Anthony Doover, his doctor – the only person who knows of Pogue's condition.  Two henchmen take him from the party to meet Philip Cornell, the man Pogue is to testify against. Cornell offers Pogue a large sum of money to deny witnessing Cornell's involvement in the crime. On re-examining his files at the office, Pogue learns that Sarah was once Cornell's lover, who decided to testify against Cornell lest he kill her because of her knowledge of his illegal activities. Sarah hired Pogue to protect her but was killed by a car bomb, the same bomb that caused his amnesia. That night, Pogue meets Sarah at a fashion show she's modeling in. She tells him the girl that was killed in the explosion was a [[Look-alike|double]], and that someone's threatening to tell Cornell ''she's'' still alive. Sarah also tells Pogue about a valuable coin Cornell stole from the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|L.A. County Museum]], which she in turn stole from him. Sarah tells Pogue that she gave him the coin the morning before the explosion; Pogue cannot remember. The only clue the two have about the coin's location is one word Pogue said when Sarah gave it to him: "Baby".  The next morning, Pogue has forgotten everything again. Cornell shows up to his office to get Pogue's sworn statement but Pogue, mistaking Cornell for his landlord, gives him a check for rent. Pogue tries throughout the day to figure out where the coin is but doesn't find any answers. Later on, he meets with Sarah; she stays at his place for the night and they make love. Pogue wakes up the following day remembering everything from the day before. Through learning his dog is Baby, he recalls that he hid the coin in its collar. He takes Sarah to a pay phone to call the people who are blackmailing her; Pogue notices that her handwriting is not the same as on the note the coin was wrapped in. Thus realizing she cannot really be Sarah Novak, he switches the coin without her knowledge. He then follows her and finds that Doover and she set up the scam to get the coin. When Doover says they'll have to start all over again after they failed to get the coin, the woman posing as Sarah refuses to go through with it again. That night, while sitting in Pogue's car outside his office, the woman reveals into one of Pogue's recorders that she's really Beth Holly, whom Doover had hired because of her resemblance to Novak. Cornell's men then kidnap Beth when they see her in the car.  On Thursday morning, Cornell, who has figured out that Pogue has the coin, abducts Pogue and takes him to his home, where he attempts to torture him to give up the coin. Pogue and Holly escape, and rush to Cornell's trial. During the trial, Pogue falls back in his chair and hits his head, then suddenly regains his memory. He tells Beth that he put the coin in a parking meter and she speeds off to get it. Pogue then gives his testimony against Cornell, which prompts Cornell to change his plea in the case. Pogue finds Beth back at his apartment and the story ends when the two kiss and go inside.  
Class of Nuke 'Em High 3: The Good, the Bad and the Subhumanoid
 Moments after the end of [[Class of Nuke 'Em High 2: Subhumanoid Meltdown|the second film]], the mutant squirrel Tromie is subdued and life in Tromaville returns to normal. Roger Smith, now mayor of Tromaville, is overjoyed at the birth of his twin sons, Dick and Adlai. Unfortunately for all concerned parties, Dick is kidnapped at the hospital and subsequently raised to be evil by the thugs who took him. Adlai, meanwhile, is raised by Roger to be kind and peaceful.   Flashing-forward several years into the future, when Dick and Adlai are adults, trouble comes in the form of the loathsome Dr. Slag, Ph.D., who uses Dick to frame Adlai for a crime he did not commit in the hopes of turning the denizens of Tromaville against him. If his wily plot works, Slag will turn the town into a toxic wasteland; with destruction looming, it is up to Adlai to save the day.  The plot is loosely based on [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]''. The only thing carried over is the storyline of the twins being separated and a later [[Identity crisis (psychology)|identity crisis]] following. Not much else remains the same.  
Clean, Shaven
 The film begins with abstract images and sounds in the director's interpretation of schizophrenia. Peter Winter has recently been released from a mental institution and upon his release, must try to experience and understand a world that is all but foreign to him.  Beginning the search for his daughter Nicole ([[Jennifer MacDonald (actress)|Jennifer MacDonald]]), Peter's car is hit by a soccer ball. A young girl looks from beyond his windshield at him, and he gets out of the car. No actual images of the girl are shown after Peter exits his car, but the screams of a young girl are heard as if Peter is beating her. He carries a large orange bag into his trunk, and the audience is meant to presume that Peter killed this little girl.  Winter returns home, where sounds invade his very being, and he is never completely at rest. He believes that there is a transmitter beneath the skin on his head and he proceeds to remove it. Peter is also disturbed by mirrors, and typically covers up any mirrors that he can access.  The car that Peter drives becomes encased in newspaper, and he isolates himself from the outside world. Peter comes back home to find his mother Mrs. Winter ([[Megan Owen]]) still very disturbed about Peter's schizophrenia. She still treats Peter as a child, and does not want him to find his daughter.  Peter, through his travels, becomes wrapped up in the investigation of the murder of another young girl. Jack McNally ([[Robert Albert]]), the detective on the case, is stymied because there is almost no evidence at the scene of the crime. Peter becomes a suspect in the case, but nothing found at the crime scene or in Peter's hotel room can link him to the murder.  That does not stop the detective from following Peter after he kidnaps his daughter from her adoptive mother. Just as Peter begins to reconcile himself with his daughter, McNally shows up, desperate to take Peter in as the murderer. Peter foolishly takes out a gun and aims it at the police officer to try to protect his daughter from McNally. McNally, believing that what he is seeing is the dead body of Peter's daughter, opens fire on Peter, killing him.  He finds the girl to be safe and fires Peter's gun in the air, so that he would not be charged for shooting a man unnecessarily. He then opens the orange bag and finds nothing but newspaper inside.

They quickly run afoul of "Reverend" Roy Foltrigg, a celebrated and vain US Attorney who is using the case as a springboard for his political ambitions. In the meantime, it is revealed that Sulari never authorized Muldano to kill the senator and wants Muldano to uncover how much the boys know. Muldano is also ordered to move the body, but currently he is unable to because it is buried in Clifford's boathouse, and police are still on the property investigating his suicide.  Foltrigg continues to use legal means to get Mark to reveal where the body is hidden, while Sulari orders Muldano to kill the children and Reggie. He also orders the body to be moved once the investigation at Clifford's home is concluded. Mark is threatened in a hospital elevator by a member of the Mafia, and is unable to talk to Foltrigg.  Mark and Reggie go to New Orleans to confirm that the body is on Clifford's property. Reggie intends to use this information to broker a deal with Foltrigg to get Ricky specialized medical care and place the family in the witness protection program. Reggie and Mark arrive at Clifford's house the same night as Muldano and his accomplices. They are digging up the body, but a melee follows when Mark and Reggie are discovered. Muldano and the others flee after Reggie trips the neighbors' alarm.  Foltrigg agrees to Reggie's demands in exchange for information about the body's location. Before the Sway family leaves to restart their lives under new identities, Mark and Reggie share a heartfelt goodbye. Although not explicitly stated, Sulari has had enough of Muldano and intends to have his nephew killed. With the body recovered, Foltrigg is a lock-in for the media headlines he craves, and mentions that he intends to run for governor.

Cobb (film)
 Sportswriter Al Stump is hired in 1960 as ghostwriter of an authorized autobiography of baseball player Tyrus Raymond "Ty" Cobb. Now 73 and in failing health, Cobb wants an official biography to "set the record straight" before he dies.  Stump arrives at Cobb's [[Lake Tahoe]] estate to write the official life story of the first baseball player inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]]. He finds a continually-drunken, misanthropic, bitter racist who abuses his biographer as well as everyone else he comes in contact with. Although Cobb's home is luxurious, it is without heat, power and running water due to long-running violent disputes between Cobb and utility companies. Cobb also rapidly runs through domestic workers, hiring and firing them in quick succession.  Although Cobb is seriously ill and prone to frequent physical breakdown, he retains considerable strength and also keeps several loaded firearms within easy reach at almost all times, making the outbreak of violent confrontation always an immediate possibility in his presence.  Cobb almost gets killed in an automobile accident off the Donner Pass, driving recklessly in a blizzard. Stump rescues him, but Cobb then seizes control of Stump's car until he gets into another accident. The car has to be towed to [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]].  Stump and Cobb go see a show at a Reno resort hotel featuring [[Keely Smith]] and [[Louis Prima]], whose act Cobb rudely interrupts. A cigarette girl, Ramona, becomes interested in Stump, but when Cobb barges into the hotel room, he's in a jealous rage. He takes Ramona to another room, where he physically abuses her.  Cobb and Stump travel together cross-country by automobile to the Baseball Hall of Fame's induction weekend in [[Cooperstown, New York]], where many star players from Cobb's era are in attendance, including [[Rogers Hornsby]] and [[Mickey Cochrane]]. Cobb is haunted by images from his violent past as he views film footage of his career.  From there, Cobb and Stump drive south to Cobb's native [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], where his estranged daughter continues to live. She refuses to see him. Stump, having spent months with Cobb witnessing his behavior and absorbing considerable abuse, is torn between creating the autobiography that Cobb hired him to write and writing his own book on Cobb's true self. Cobb begins to regard Stump as a friend of sorts; it is clear his conduct has driven away virtually all his legitimate friends and family.  Stump writes two books simultaneously: the one Cobb expects, and his own, sensational, merciless account which will reveal the real Cobb, warts and all. Stump plans to complete Cobb's version while the old man is still alive, guaranteeing his payment for the project, letting Cobb die happy, then issue the hard-hitting followup after Cobb is gone. After a long night of drinking when his own personal life begins to unravel, Stump passes out. Cobb discovers his notes for the no-punches-pulled version, bringing on an epic explosion.  Cobb begins to cough up blood and is taken to a hospital, where he wields a gun and treats doctors and nurses as harshly as he has everyone else. Stump gains a grudging respect for the player's legendary intensity and fearsome competitive fire, as well as an understanding that the murder of Cobb's father may have been partly responsible for his antagonistic personality. Stump is conflicted in his opinion of Cobb, and, in the end, completes the glowing autobiography Cobb hired him to write.

Sabrina helps her out not getting caught and thereby wins their trust. The next day, Ellie and Tina nominate her for sorority president, meaning she will be competing against Rita. When she finds out she can only become president if her grades for French are better, she seduces her teacher and later blackmails him.  Later that night, she blackmails Rita to give up her title as sorority president, threatening to reveal that her mother is in jail if she doesn't.

She next convinces Tina to tell everyone that Mort is the father of her baby, thereby possibly assuring her financial support. After the announcement, she is kicked out of campus, but, after a failed suicide attempt, keeps on blackmailing Mort. Vulnerable, she admits to him that she was pushed by Sabrina to do so. After she left, it turns out that he recorded the conversation. Later, Tina accepts a marriage proposal from Jimmy. Rita decides to rekindle with Mort after she hears the audio conversation.

The couple were to be married the following day on Halloween. As he leaves for the hospital with Shelly, Albrecht meets a young girl, Sarah ([[Rochelle Davis]]), who says that she is their friend, and that they take care of her.  One year later, Sarah visits the graves of Eric Draven and Shelly Webster. After she leaves, a crow lands on Eric's grave stone and taps it; later that night, Eric comes back to life and claws his way out of his grave. Meanwhile, a low-level street gang, headed by T-Bird ([[David Patrick Kelly]]), blow up a video arcade. Eric goes to his old apartment and finds it derelict. He has flashbacks of the murders, remembering that those responsible were T-Bird and his gang: Tin Tin, Funboy, and Skank. Eric soon discovers that any wounds he receives heal immediately. Painting his face to resemble a harlequin mask and guided by the crow, he sets out to avenge his and Shelly's murders by killing the perpetrators.  The crow helps Eric locate Tin Tin, who stabbed him the year before. Eric finds Tin Tin in an alley and the two begin to fight. Eric subdues Tin Tin with his own knife, and kills him by stabbing him in each vital organ, in alphabetical order, with his own knives and then takes his coat, leaving a crow symbol drawn in Tin Tin's blood. He then goes to the pawn shop where Tin Tin pawned Shelly's engagement ring. Eric forces the owner, Gideon, to return the ring. Eric then tosses rings telling Gideon each of them is a life - a life Gideon helped destroy. He lets Gideon live so that he can warn the others that "death is coming for them" before blowing up his shop. Eric then runs into Albrecht and obliquely explains who he is and why he is here before vanishing. Later, Funboy and Sarah's drug-addicted mother, Darla, are caught by Eric in the midst of their drug session. Before killing Funboy with a fatal overdose of morphine, Eric talks to Darla, expelling the drug from her arm and making her realize that Sarah needs her to be a good mother. Eric later visits Albrecht, at his house, and Albrecht tells him what he knows about Shelly's death and that he watched as she suffered for thirty hours before dying. Eric touches Albrecht and receives from him the pain felt by Shelly during those hours. As T-Bird and Skank stop at a convenience store to pick up some supplies, Eric arrives and kidnaps T-Bird in his own car. Skank follows the pair in a stolen car to the docks where Eric and T-Bird have arrived. Using duct tape, Eric ties T-Bird to the car and detonates a grenade inside before putting the car in drive, forcing T-Bird to drive it off the edge of the pier when the grenade explodes and sinks the exploding car into the harbor, killing T-Bird as Skank watches on from afar.  The next day, Sarah and her mother begin to repair their strained relationship. Sarah goes to Eric's apartment and talks to him. She tells him that she misses him and Shelly. Eric explains that, even though they cannot be friends anymore, he still cares about her. Skank frantically informs Top Dollar, a top-level criminal who controls all the street gangs in the city, about Eric. Top Dollar and his lover/half-sister Myca have become aware of Eric's actions through various reports from witnesses (including Gideon, whom Top Dollar killed afterward). Top Dollar holds a meeting with his associates on Devil's Night where they discuss new plans for their Devil's Night criminal activities. Eric interrupts the meeting looking for Skank. After Top Dollar refuses to give up Skank, a gunfight ensures between Eric and all of Top Dollar's associates and nearly all present are killed by Eric. Top Dollar, Myca, and Grange (Top Dollar's right-hand man) manage to escape during the gunfight, while Eric kills Skank by throwing him out a window before evading police capture. While Top Dollar reflects on Eric's prowess, Myca (who is a follower of mysticism) explains how Eric can be defeated - by killing his crow guide.  Eric, having finished his quest, returns to his grave, where he finds Sarah waiting. He says goodbye to her and gives her Shelly's engagement ring. She is then abducted by Grange, who takes her into the church where Top Dollar and Myca are waiting. Through the crow, Eric realizes what has happened and goes to rescue her. Grange shoots the crow as it flies into the church, making Eric lose his invincibility. Myca grabs the wounded crow, intending to take its mystical power. Albrecht arrives, intending to pay his respects to Eric, just after Eric is shot and wounded. Top Dollar grabs Sarah and climbs the bell tower as a fight ensues; Grange is shot and killed by Albrecht. When Albrecht is wounded, Eric climbs to the tower where he is confronted at gunpoint by Myca. Before Myca can shoot Eric, the crow escapes Myca's grip, pecking her eyes out and causing her to fall down the bell tower to her death. Eric climbs to the roof of the church, where he is confronted by Top Dollar, holding Sarah hostage. There, Top Dollar admits ultimate responsibility for what happened to Eric and Shelly (setting the actions of T-Bird, Tin Tin, Skank and Funboy in motion at the beginning). Top Dollar tosses Sarah to the side, and Eric and Top Dollar fight on the roof. In their fight, Eric is fatally stabbed in the back. Before Top Dollar can kill Eric, he admits ultimate responsibility for their deaths. Eric grabs Top Dollar's head and gives him the thirty hours of pain from Shelly he absorbed from Albrecht. The sensation sends Top Dollar falling from the roof of the church and being fatally impaled on the horns of a gargoyle. As Sarah and Albrecht go to the hospital, Eric is reunited with Shelly at their graves. Sarah ends the film with a narration: "If the people we love are stolen from us, the way to have them live on is to never stop loving them. Buildings burn, people die, but real love is forever."

 Former peewee [[ice hockey]] coach Gordon Bombay is a star in the minor leagues and is expected to make it to the [[National Hockey League]] soon. However, after a career-ending knee injury, he returns to [[Minneapolis]]. Bombay is then offered a chance to coach a team representing the United States in the Junior [[Goodwill Games]]. He manages to get many of the old Ducks back together, while the Hawks tried to enact revenge against them for the humiliating loss two years earlier. Their plans are foiled when Fulton prevents it and punishes them by tying the three up and leaving them in their underpants. Team USA consists of many of the old Ducks, in addition to five new players with special talents.  The lure of celebrity becomes a distraction to Bombay, who begins to neglect the team in exchange for a luxurious lifestyle. Fortunately, easy victories come over Trinidad and Tobago and Italy in the double-elimination tournament. During this time, Fulton Reed and Dean Portman gain recognition for their [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]] skills, becoming known as the "Bash Brothers". Backup goaltender Julie asks Bombay for a chance to play, but he tells her to wait, as current goalie Greg Goldberg is on a hot streak.  Reality sets in when the team suffers an embarrassing 12–1 defeat at the hands of Team Iceland, coached by ex-NHL player Wolf "The Dentist" Stansson, who is known for his tough reputation. Team USA plays badly, with Julie and Portman ejected from the game. Star center Adam Banks manages to score a goal but gets slashed in the wrist moments later. Frustrated, Bombay drives his players even harder, but they begin to suffer, completely exhausted. His practice sessions become brutal and long.  Realizing the children are too tired to complete their school work or even stay awake in class, the team's tutor, Michelle McKay, intervenes.  She cancels the practice and confronts Bombay.  Now better rested, the players come across a street hockey team who teaches them how to play like "the real Team USA".  However, Bombay continues to suffer until Jan, the brother of Bombay's mentor Hans, personally visits him, and reminds him of how he used to love the game. During a match against Team Germany, Bombay fails to arrive on time, forcing Charlie to tell the referee that Michelle is actually the team's assistant coach. The team is struggling, entering the third period tied, until Bombay shows up and apologizes for his behavior. Inspired by their coach's "return", the players come back to win the game with the "Flying V" move, and advance to the next round. The renewed Bombay finally realizes Adam's wrist injury, benching him despite his complaints. To fill the open roster spot, Charlie recruits local street hockey player, Russ Tyler, whose unique "knucklepuck" (which rotates end over end toward its target as opposed to spinning about its centerline) secures USA's victory over Russia (who defeated Iceland earlier in the tournament, putting USA and Iceland both one loss away from elimination), advancing USA to the championship game for a rematch against Iceland. Before the game, Adam's injury is healed and returns to Team USA's locker room, only to find they already have a full roster. Charlie gives up his spot on the roster so Adam can play, cementing his position as the true team captain.  At first, Iceland appears to be out to dominate Team USA again, but they manage to score one goal. Unfortunately, the Ducks take penalties: Ken picks a fight with an Iceland player after scoring the team's first goal, the Bash Brothers celebrate this by fighting with the entire Iceland bench and Dwayne lassos an opposing player, about to check Connie. Bombay is annoyed because "this isn't a hockey game, it's a circus."  After a motivational locker room speech from Bombay and new Duck jerseys from Jan, the team emerges rejuvenated. The Ducks manage to tie the game with a score from Connie, Banks, Luis, and finally when Russ outsmarts Team Iceland by disguising himself as Goldberg, so as to prevent himself from being covered and pulling off a successful "knucklepuck". The game is forced to go to a five-shot [[Overtime (ice hockey)|shootout]]. With a 4–3 score in favor of the Ducks, Gunnar Stahl (the tournament's leading scorer) is Team Iceland's final shooter. Bombay knows Gunnar favors shooting the glove side after a triple [[deke (ice hockey)|deke]], and replaces Goldberg with Julie, who has a faster glove. Gunnar advances on Julie and fires a hard [[slapshot]]. Although Julie falls to the ice, she slowly turns to look at her glove while the entire stadium waits in breathless anticipation. She then opens her glove and drops the puck, signifying the game-winning save. With this, the Ducks triumph over Iceland to win the tournament. Despite Wolf's disappointment, he congratulates Bombay and Gunnar, being the gentleman he is congratulates Charlie stating "Good work, Captain Duck".  The film concludes with the team returning to [[Minnesota]] on a plane and sitting around a campfire singing [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[We Are the Champions]]" as the credits roll.  
Cyborg Cop II
 Crime boss Jesse Starkraven leads his gang in an attack on a drug den not cooperating with Starkraven's demands; the assault quickly turns into a hostage situation when police arrive. Renegade DEA agent Jack Ryan arrives and attempts to negotiate with Starkraven, however this fails when Starkraven recognizes Ryan as the officer who killed his brother Harlan during a crime some time prior. Starkraven kills several hostages including Ryan's partner before he is finally captured. Subsequently, Starkraven is convinced of killing a cop and sentenced to death.  While awaiting his sentence on death row, Starkraven is kidnapped by government agents under the guise of a prison transfer. He is taken into the custody of the "Anti-Terrorism Group" and converted into a [[cyborg]] alongside several other test subjects. Now dubbed "Spartacus" by the scientists, he is meant to lead the army of cyborg soldiers. Meanwhile, Ryan learns of Starkraven's apparent escape and begins conducting an investigation to find him against the orders of his boss, Captain Salerno. He collaborates with former sheriff Sam Pickens, who is still well respected in the community even after being removed from office for looking too far into the ATG's activity.  During a party to celebrate the success of the project, head scientist Dr. Owns takes a woman into the room where Spartacus and the other cyborgs are awaiting activation. While they have a romantic encounter, Spartacus suddenly awakens and attacks them, killing the woman while taking Owns hostage. Spartacus seizes and destroys all but one control bracelet, which he keeps for himself to give himself control over the other cyborgs. He has the other cyborgs kill everyone at the party by burning down the building before leaving in a truck with Owns held hostage for a second facility, where more cyborgs are being created.  ATG project leader Liz McDowell arrives the next day to review the incident and attempts to track down Spartacus quietly. However, Ryan's investigation brings him to her attention. She sends agents to follow him, but he swiftly dispatches them. Later, he breaks into an ATG office to gather information. He is detected by dogs and confronted by security guards, but escapes after discovering proof that Starkraven was taken by the ATG for conversion into a cyborg. Meanwhile, Spartacus and some of the other cyborgs travel to a gas station to steal fuel for their recharging generators. Ryan arrives and saves a woman and young boy from them, but is defeated by Spartacus and nearly killed, but he survives when authorities arrive and critically damage Spartacus, forcing the cyborgs to retreat. Ryan is arrested and brought before McDowell, who warns him not to interfere with the ATG. He subsequently escapes from her men and travels to Pickens' home in order to prepare for an assault on Spartacus's headquarters.  Spartacus announces his intention to conquer cities and convert all humans into cyborgs, establishing an empire with himself as the leader, and dispatches two cyborgs to kill Ryan. Ryan manages to defeat and destroy them, but not before they kill Pickens. McDowell arrives and is convinced by Ryan to team up with him, providing the weaponry necessary to destroy Spartacus. The two arm themselves and travel to the facility where the cyborgs are hiding, destroying a number of them on their way to the lab. Once they get there, Spartacus appears on a video screen and reveals that he has taken Ryan's son hostage. The cyborgs bring Ryan and McDowell before Spartacus, who tells them he will turn Ryan's son into a cyborg before converting them as well. Ryan overpowers the cyborgs, frees his son and fights Spartacus, managing to steal the control bracelet and deactivate the other cyborgs. Spartacus is dropped into electric cables by a magnet, and is killed when Ryan pours liquid onto him, electrocuting him. Ryan, his son and McDowell flee the facility before bombs they set earlier detonate, destroying it.  
CyberTracker (film)
 In the future, Eric Anthony Phillips is the head of the Secret Service detachment assigned to protect Senator Robert "Bob" Dilly ([[John Aprea]]). Sen. Dilly is a champion of the recently implemented Computerized Judicial System (Computerized Justice for short), a product of Cybercore Industry, that uses data as evidence to determine the guilt of accused criminals, then carries out the sentence using cyborg executioners called "Trackers" (Maniaci).  However, the more Phillips learns about Dilly and the Cybercore's ruthless plans, the more uncomfortable he becomes and he refuses to go along with the murder of a corporate spy. This leads Dilly and Cybercore to frame Phillips with the murder as they activate a Tracker to execute him. Phillips defeats the Tracker but is taken by a group of underground rebels called the Union for Human Rights (UHR). The group is secretly led by popular news journalist Connie Griffith (Foster).  While being tracked by another Tracker and Dilly's head bodyguard (Norton), Phillips and Connie are able to break into Cybercore and steal secret files revealing that Sen. Dilly is in fact a cyborg. Phillips defeats the bodyguard and yet a third Tracker and then infiltrates a press conference to shoot Dilly, publicly revealing his mechanical nature. This, along with everything else UHR has discovered, causes the Computerized Judicial System to be shut down and Cybercore to collapse.  ===Cast===  * [[Don Wilson (kickboxer)|Don 'The Dragon' Wilson]] as Eric * [[Richard Norton (actor)|Richard Norton]] as Ross * [[Stacie Foster]] as Connie * [[Joseph Ruskin]] as Rounds * [[John Aprea]] as Senator Dilly * [[Abby Dalton]] as Chief Olson * [[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]] as Jared * David Barnathan as Marcus * Edward Blanchard as Gil * Lisa Larosa as Ally * Christina Zilber as Kate (credited as Christina Naify) * Duchess Dale as Becca * G.

Dark Waters (1994 film)
 The [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] involves a young [[England|English]] woman named Elizabeth, who, after the death of her father, travels to a [[convent]] on a remote [[island]] where her mother died after giving birth to her. The convent is populated only by [[nun]]s, who practise strange [[ritual]]s in the [[catacombs]] under the building and who seem to hold something at bay down there.  A priest is shown in a church studying a strange ancient book. Outside there a violent storm is raging. The church begins to collapse and the priest is impaled by the spike on top of a fallen crucifix. Later a nun is shown bearing a strange pagan amulet to the edge of the sea. As she stands on the cliff she is approached from behind by someone or something that frightens her so much that she falls to her death. The amulet she was carrying is smashed on the rocks but it's pieces are shown being recovered by someone who is not identified.  20 years later a young heiress from London, Elizabeth, is traveling to a remote convent to visit her friend. She is shown on a rustic country bus that is full of strange characters.  Meanwhile, a young girl in a novice nun's cassock is shown entering an underground catacomb through a crack in a wall. She watches a sinister ritual where nun's beat themselves with whips and lay face down on the ground in some sort of pattern. The girl is then attacked from behind by someone with a knife. While the ritual continues below the girl is repeatedly stabbed. Her blood flows into a stream which pours out over a large crucifix.  Elizabeth arrives at her destination during a heavy rainstorm (which continues through much of the movie) and has to deal with various creepy or insane locals before she finds someone willing to take her on a boat to the island where the convent is located. Elizabeth is greeted by the nuns and taken to the ancient Mother Superior who is blind and communicates through an assistant. She tells the Mother Superior that she is there to see why her father donated money to the convent and if she is willing to continue the charity.  She is provided with a room but all her possessions are confiscated until she decides to leave. Shortly after she is befriended by a seemingly innocent novice, Sarah, who is appointed to act as her guide during her stay. Sarah tells her that the friend she came to visit has left the convent and returned to London. Elizabeth reveals to Sarah that she was actually born on the island and lived there until she was seven.  Elizabeth and Sarah visit the decaying library of the convent. There they discover an ancient book with sinister images of a demonic creature. They also find a strange painting that features a pair of young girls and a pagan amulet. While Sarah is out of the room looking for more light Elizabeth is attacked by one of the nuns. Elizabeth narrowly escapes when the nun accidentally falls to her death out of an open window.  Elizabeth then discovers an entrance into a labyrinth of catacombs beneath the convent. There she spies on a strange procession of nuns carrying burning crosses and a bloody corpse wrapped in a sheet. While following this procession Elizabeth gets lost and wanders into a pit-like room where a blind painter has covered the walls and canvases with enigmatic images. She recognizes one of the faces on the wall as that of her missing friend and realizes that the body the nuns were carrying might well have been hers.  The next day she sees a boat leaving the island despite Sarah having told her that there would be way to reach the mainland for several days.  Elizabeth begins to suspect that Sarah might not be as friendly as she appears. She also starts having strange dreams/visions. One involves seeing a crucified nun accompanied by two small girls. Later, she finds the beach covered by thousands of dead fish... she begins eating one before coming to her senses and vomiting. While wandering on the beach one of the villagers shows Elizabeth some photos of her childhood on the island which include another little girl and what seems to be Elizabeth's mother, who had supposedly died in childbirth. Elizabeth goes to her childhood home and questions the old woman who cared for her as a child. Their meeting is interrupted by the nuns when they set fire to the house. Elizabeth escapes but the old woman is hideously burned. Meanwhile Sarah is shown uncovering a piece of the shattered pagan amulet shown in the painting. A nun comes up to stab her but is later shown cut to ribbons and nailed to a chair. The blind painter gives a painting of Elizabeth to the Mother Superior. The old blind woman begins to smudge off the wet paint and reveals a demonic face underneath.  Elizabeth makes her way back to the convent. There are dead and dying nuns everywhere. She is attacked by a nun wielding a huge knife but she manages to kill her by bashing her head on the stone floor. Elizabeth descends into the catacombs where she finds more dead nuns. The blind painter is shown using the Mother Superior's blood to paint more strange images on the wall. Elizabeth is then approached by Sarah, who removes the top of her cassock to reveal that much of her body is not human at all. She is not entirely human.  It is revealed that Sarah is Elizabeth's sister but that she more closely resembles their mother. Their mother is actually the demon depicted in the book and on the pagan amulet. The nuns were trying to prevent Elizabeth from realizing her heritage and attempting to free her demon-mother from the walled up crypt she is trapped in. The two women had previously tried to free their demon-mother when they were children but Elizabeth had gotten scared and ran away. She and her father fled the island but it is presumed Sarah has been there ever since, waiting for her to return and complete the ceremony.  Now the grown-up Sarah and Elizabeth begin the ritual again. The pieces of the shattered amulet are placed on the ground by a captured nun. Elizabeth eviscerates the nun and the falling blood causes the broken amulet to become whole again. The women raise the blood-soaked amulet and their demon-mother begins to break free of her prison.  Just like before Elizabeth becomes terrified and throws the amulet... shattering it into pieces again. Sarah goes to the demon-mother while Elizabeth runs away.  At the end of the movie Elizabeth is shown on the beach of the island. She is now in a nun's habit and putting on a necklace made of the center fragment of the shattered amulet. Her white eyes now look like those of the blind Mother Superior's.

Death Machine
 In the near future of 2003, the controversial megacorporation '''Chaank Armament''' is the world's leading manufacturer of cutting-edge weapons and military hardware. A [[Cybernetics|cybernetically]]-enhanced [[supersoldier]], codenamed "Hard Man", malfunctions and massacres the patrons of a roadside diner before being deactivated by security operatives led by John Carpenter. Soon, public outcry ensues following the incident. The majority of complaints are directed towards the company's new chief executive Hayden Cale.  Chairman of the Board Scott Ridley, fearful of the potential termination of Chaank's contracts due to the bad publicity, tries to cover up the incident and numerous issues with ''Project: Hard Man'' itself. Cale demands immediate and full public disclosure, having purposely leaked a number of top-secret documents to the press in defiance of Ridley's attempts to suppress knowledge about his shadier activities. She also demands for Jack Dante, a deranged weapon designer and lead developer of ''Project: Hard Man'', to be fired. Despite Carpenter's acknowledgement of the project's numerous fatal flaws, the board simply ignores Cale's requests, no one seeming to care about her interests except for Dante himself. Cale is warned by a junior executive about Dante's unstable behavior and the fate of Nicholson, her late predecessor. Cale goes to confront him, demanding to know about Dante's secret project in Vault 10, for which he never submits progress reports on. Far from cooperative,  he instead threatens Cale. Dante blackmails her with detailed knowledge of Cale's living situation, place of residence, and personal information. Cale asks Ridley for help, but he refuses while telling her that Nicholson took a similar interest in Dante's work. However, he was killed in a mysterious accident believed to have been an animal mauling. During their confrontation, Cale manages to lift Ridley's access card so she can investigate on her own. Dante learns that Cale has the card and confronts Ridley, subsequently killing him with a mysterious weapon.  Meanwhile, a trio of [[eco-warrior]]s (Raimi, Weyland, and Yutani) infiltrate the Chaank headquarters in order to destroy its digitally-stored assets and send the company into bankruptcy. Carpenter calls Cale after finding Ridley's mutilated corpse which had an implanted life-sign transmitter. She investigates Ridley's death and discovers that whatever killed him came from Vault 10. Taking matters into her own hands, she terminates Dante's employment and seals the vault. Dante is about to shoot her when the eco-warriors show up and take everyone hostage. They demand access to the building's secure area in order to destroy the company's digital bonds, but Cale refuses to cooperate. Raimi goes to their alternate plan to cut through the bulkhead leading to the containment area. Dante, sensing his chance, "helps" them by suggesting they cut through one of the vaults surrounding the containment instead, suggesting they start at Vault 10.  Once the vault is open, Dante jumps in and activates his invention called the Frontline Morale Destroyer (aka "Warbeast"), a monster-shaped robot that targets and hunts people by their fear. The Warbeast kills Weyland and Raimi flees back to Yutani and the subdued Cale and Carpenter. Dante broadcasts his demands over the monitor system, demanding his employment be reinstated and Cale to "interface with him on a regular basis".  Raimi and Yutani cancel the operation and attempt to get out of the building, along with Carpenter and Cale. Carpenter is killed by the Warbeast inside of a lift. Later on, Raimi, Yutani, and Cale manage to reach the top floor of the building, which holds classified items, whose existence even Cale is unaware of. Among the classified items are components of ''Project: Hard Man'', including advanced weaponry and armour, and Cale pieces together that ''Project: Hard Man'' uses injured, missing in action army men, to make the cybernetically-enhanced supersoldiers. Left with no other options, they suit Raimi up in the equipment and download the Hard Man data into his brain to allow them to fight the Warbeast and make their escape via an outdoor service elevator, but Yutani is killed by the Warbeast after hitting his head and falling in front of it. Once they make it down to the surface, Cale removes the Hard Man data from Raimi, before they have an encounter with a police officer who is quickly killed by the Warbeast as it leaped from the rooftop, and chases them back into the building. They use explosives to partially incapacitate the Warbeast, but Raimi is knocked unconscious. The machine takes Cale back to Dante in Vault 10. During their conversation, Cale districts Dante so that Raimi, who at that point had regained consciousness and made it to where they are, can subdue him. The two escape, and Cale seals Vault 10, trapping Dante in the vault with his Warbeast and an explosive, that she then detonates.  
Death and the Maiden (film)
 Paulina Escobar (Weaver) is a housewife married to a prominent lawyer in an unnamed [[South America]]n country. One day a storm forces her husband Gerardo (Wilson) to ride home with a charming stranger. She is convinced that the stranger, Dr. Miranda (Kingsley), was part of the old regime and that he [[torture]]d and [[rape]]d her for weeks while she was blindfolded. Paulina takes him captive to determine the truth. Despite attempts by both her husband and Miranda to convince her that he is innocent, Paulina is certain that he is the one, and forces her husband to be Miranda's "attorney" in the "trial" she arranges for him.  Miranda conspires with Gerardo to agree to a false confession (as Paulina states that this is all that she wants in exchange for his life), so they write one up and present it to Paulina. Enraged, Paulina deems Miranda as being unrepentant, and threatens to kill him. As Gerardo tries to stop her, Miranda succeeds in getting Paulina's gun, and threatens to kill her if he is not freed. As he advances toward the door, Paulina hits him and after a struggle gets back in control. In a last-ditch effort to save his life, Miranda implores Gerardo to call the Spanish medical school where he claims to have been at the time of Paulina's rape, as she leads him blindfolded out the door to the edge of the cliff. Gerardo contacts the school, where Miranda's colleague seems to confirm the story. He races to inform Paulina, at last convinced that Miranda is innocent. Paulina refuses to believe it, however, saying that the doctors at that time created alibis in order to conceal their identities. Accepting defeat, Miranda finally tells them that he really was the doctor, that he enjoyed brutalizing Paulina, and that he was sorry that the old regime fell.  Enraged, Gerardo attempts to throw Miranda from the cliff, only to realize he cannot bring himself to take a life. Paulina apparently accepts the confession, and they both leave Miranda on the cliff as he stares down at the water. The camera simulates someone falling off the cliff as seen from his own point of view. In the final scene, Paulina and Gerardo are at the same concert where the film began with Miranda also present, looking down with his wife and sons. Paulina and Miranda cast uncomfortable glances at each other, and look away. Miranda glances down at the couple again as the camera shows Gerardo glancing up towards the balcony at the now off-screen Miranda.

Deadful Melody
 Xuemei recalls the death of her entire family as she gently plays the magical lyre. The time of her peaceful upbringing was interrupted by her father's old classmate who, on the verge of death, begs him to take the magical lyre and to flee. However, when he was forced to fight the oncoming raid of the 6 well-known master martial artists, his family was scattered and decimated except for Xuemei, who escaped with the lyre by surviving a waterfall. Currently in the present, Lun Lin, heir to the Tianhu Escort Agency, is being promoted so his father, Teng Lin, could retire. To prove that his escort agency is the best, Lun Lin foolishly takes on the mission of delivering the infamous magical lyre to Hou Xeng (one of the pursuing master martial artists) when everyone else avoided the mission for fear of their lives. Lun Lin's master arrives (late as usual) and warns him about the magical lyre and the deaths it racks up due to the people chasing it.  When some of the master martial artists heard of the sudden reappearance of the magical lyre, a private meeting was held between Ghost and Fire (later the Hard-Hearted Witch) yet no ideas or attempts were made to retrieve the lyre, as they desperately trying to get in contact with Tong Fong Pak (who is uninterested in their meetings). Lun Lin and his father stops at a rest stop but were ambushed by Hou Xeng's son, who is later murdered by Xuemei dressed as a man to make her own identity unknown. The Hard-Hearted Witch also successfully ambushes Lun Lin and Teng Lin only to be stopped by Xuemei. Lun Lin continues to a rest inn where Fire's disciple, Tan Yuehua, was dressed as a male innkeeper to slyly rob the lyre behind Lun Lin's back but ended up saving him from a swarm of robbers. When Lun Lin catches her stealing the lyre, he ties her up and left her where the sons of Ghost intended to sexually assault her. With the help of Xuemei again, the two were able to escape. Xuemei suspects that Lun Lin is her brother whom she was separated from during the chaos of her family's massacre and attempts to check his body while he was resting; Yueha stops her from going any further.  Yueha, thankful for Lun Lin's kindness in saving her, decided not to take the lyre and instead, lets Lun Lin deliver it to Hou Xeng. Unfortunately, when the lyre was delivered, only the corpse of Hou Xeng's son was left in the lyre's container. As Fire and Yuehua make their way to Mo Yee Mountain to meet with the rest of the masters, Lun Lin stops them and blames Yuehua for taking the lyre and leaving the corpse. He was left tied up (similar to what he did to Yuehua) on a tree by Fire. As the masters meet, Teng Lun gets the apparent blame for the death of both Hou Xeng's and his son's death and was attacked by one of the masters. Xuemei reveals herself to the masters as she goes on a destruction to kill them with the magical lyre. Teng Lun, recognizing Xuemei, asked her about her brother, confirming her previous suspicions; however, when Lun Lin reaches him, Teng Lin's sentence was cut short upon his death, making it seemed as if Xuemei was his killer. She flees the scene.  Ghost, Fire, and the Hard-Hearted Witch regroups and tells Tong Fong Pak to reunite with them, believing that their reunion will prevent Xuemei from attacking them. Tong Fong Pak instead proposes that he will reunite with the masters and be directly under Fire's command only if marriage with Yuehua is a guarantee. When Yuehua hears this news and with little success in begging Fire to back out of the marriage arrangement, she runs away. Lun Lin buries his father and is a drunken mess. He is visited by Xuemei, who tells him of his original family but is unsuccessful. After she left, his master arrives to tell him about his (late) arrival around the time of his family's massacre, in which he discovered Lun Lin and deemed him as the only survivor of his family. Their reunion is cut short as they catch Ghost in his unsuccessful attempt to ambush Xuemei and take the lyre. As Ghost escapes, Lun Lin tries to convince Xuemei not to take any vengeance but Xuemei will not give up.  Not being able to convince his sister, Lun Lin decides to avenge his parents as well and proceeds to fight with Tong Fong Pak first. Xuemei joins Lun Lin and takes control of the battle, managing to decapitate Tong Fong Pak and leaves with it. She delivers the head into the hands of Fire, Hard-Hearted Witch, and Ghost and then proceeds to kill murder the army within the fort along with Ghost. Fire and the Witch counterattacks by pushing a drum towards her, in which Xuemei was injured in her own attack after firing at the drum. Lun Lin was able to repel Fire and Witch's attack against Xuemei, but he suffers injury from using the lyre improperly. At the last minute before Witch and Fire could snatch the lyre, Xuemei injures them with the lyre. The Witch left in bitterness for the failures but explodes before she could fully escape and Fire's life was spared from Yuehua's begging.  Xuemei returned to the waterfall where she fell, playing the lyre while Lun Lin returned presumably to the Tianhu Escort Agency.

Disclosure (film)
 Bob Garvin, a technology company founder, plans to retire when his company merges with a larger company. Production line manager Tom Sanders expects to be promoted to run the CD-ROM division. Instead, Meredith Johnson, a former girlfriend, is promoted to the post.  Meredith calls Tom into her office to discuss some operations, and forces herself onto him. He initially reciprocates, but then rebuffs her. Meredith screams a threat to make him pay for spurning her.  The next day, Tom discovers that Meredith has filed a sexual harassment complaint against him with legal counsel Philip Blackburn. To save the merger from a scandal, DigiCom officials demand that Tom accept reassignment to another location. If Tom does this, he will lose his stock options in the new company. Furthermore, the reassignment will ruin his career and leave him jobless as the other location is scheduled for sale after the merger.  Tom receives an e-mail from someone identified only as "A Friend." It directs him to Seattle attorney Catherine Alvarez, who specializes in sexual harassment cases. Tom decides to sue DigiCom, alleging that Meredith is the one who harassed him. The initial mediation goes badly for Tom as Meredith blames him.  Garvin proposes that if Tom drops the matter, he will not have to transfer. This causes Tom to suspect that Meredith's accusations have a vulnerability. Tom remembers misdialing a number on his cell phone at the time of his meeting and Meredith throwing his phone (but not hanging up), thus inadvertently creating a recording on a colleague's voicemail of the entire encounter. Tom plays the recording at the next meeting and discredits Meredith. DigiCom agrees to a settlement calling for Meredith to be quietly eased out after the merger closes.  As Tom is celebrating his apparent victory, he receives another e-mail from "A Friend" warning that all is not what it seems. Tom overhears Meredith talking to Blackburn that even if they slipped him through the harassment accusation, they'll make him look incompetent at next morning's merger conference. If the problems with the CD-ROMs are shown as coming from the production line, which is under Tom's responsibility, he can be fired for cause.  Tom attempts to look for clues in the company database regarding the talk he overheard. But his access privileges have been revoked. He remembers that the merging company's executives have a DigiCom [[virtual reality]] demonstration machine in a hotel room with access to company databases. He breaks in to use it, but as he gets into DigiCom's files, he sees Meredith is already deleting them. Unexpectedly, Tom receives a call from a Malaysian colleague who can fax copies of incriminating memos and he gets them. They show that Meredith was conspiring with the head of operations in Malaysia, to change the plant and product specifications Tom has implemented for sabotaging Tom's career.  When Tom makes his presentation at the conference and Meredith brings up the production problems, he shows the memos and a video exposing her direct involvement in causing defects with the hardware. Meredith says that Tom is mounting a last-ditch effort to take revenge on her. However, later Meredith discloses to Tom that she is a [[professional victim|victim]] of Garvin and Blackburn's [[office politics]].  Garvin fires incompetent Meredith and declares Stephanie Kaplan as the new vice president. Despite wishing for the position himself, Tom is pleased that his colleague has been promoted. Tom knows through Stephanie's son, Spencer, that they sent the mails as "A Friend" or Arthur Friend from a professor's account to support him through the ordeal. Satisfied, Tom returns to his old technical position.

He obtains one half and orders his henchmen to find the other for him.  Teenage brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee, and their guardian/adoptive mother Satori head home after citywide curfew from a martial arts tournament. On their way, they are accosted by gang members, who rule the streets after dark due to an uneasy pact made with the police department to keep them from running amok during the day. They escape with help from the Power Corps, a group of vigilantes headed by their friend Marian, daughter of the police chief. Unfortunately, Abobo, a gang leader, discovers Satori holds the second medallion half and reports this to Shuko. For his failure in securing it, he is mutated into a hulking giant.  At their abandoned theater home, Satori explains to a skeptical Billy and Jimmy about the Double Dragon and how their piece must be protected, and she places it in the care of Billy. Shuko, with his henchmen in tow, pays the Lees a visit, intent on taking the other half. He reveals the ability of his medallion, the power of the soul, which gives the user the power of possession and a shadow form, by temporarily possessing Satori. Billy and Jimmy successfully incapacitate Abobo, but Shuko has the place doused in gasoline and lit on fire. Satori sacrifices herself so the brothers can escape with the Dragon.  Unable to find the brothers on his own, Shuko unites and takes over the gangs by displaying his power and sends them after the Lees.

Marian agrees to help them, using this as an opportunity to get rid of the gangs once and for all, and the three of them decide to go to Shuko’s office building to steal his medallion. They ultimately fail and are forced to flee, but Jimmy is captured in the process.  Billy and Marian return to the Power Corps base, and lament about how none of them have been able to figure out how to use their Dragon piece. Marian points out a discovery they made that the wearer of the medallion is immune to the powers of its counterpart, meaning Shuko is not able to possess him as long as he has it. Suddenly, the gangs attack the hideout. In the mélêe, Jimmy reappears. Billy is elated; however, Jimmy is merely being controlled by Shuko as he tries to pummel his brother into submission. Billy then accidentally activates his medallion’s ability, which is the power of the body and effectively makes him invulnerable to harm. Knowing this, Shuko threatens to kill Jimmy instead. This doesn’t succeed either, so he releases Jimmy to distract Billy long enough to get the medallion.  Shuko unites the halves and turns into a pair of shadow warriors with katanas that disintegrate anything they slice through. The Lee brothers fight, but cannot beat him. Abobo, who had previously been taken prisoner and since reformed, reveals to Marian that Shuko’s weakness is light. Marian reactivates the hideout’s generator, and the shadow warriors are rendered powerless. Billy and Jimmy attack, forcefully recombining the shadows into Shuko, and acquire the Double Dragon halves. They combine the two pieces, granting them matching uniforms and the medallion powers, and they briefly see a vision of Satori’s spirit as she gives them encouraging words. The brothers pummel Shuko, and Jimmy possesses him to make him do embarrassing things. During this time, Marian’s father arrives to bring Shuko to justice and to take care of the gangs once and for all. Jimmy has Shuko write a check to the police department for $129 million before encouraging the police chief to arrest him.  Shuko is sent to jail, the police department has renewed strength to fight the gangs instead of compromising with them, and Billy and Jimmy can now keep both halves of the medallion safe.

Drop Zone (film)
 Aboard a commercial airliner, U.S. Marshals Terry ([[Malcolm-Jamal Warner]]) and Pete Nessip ([[Wesley Snipes]]), are escorting computer expert Earl Leedy ([[Michael Jeter]]) to a high security prison. When an apparent terrorist hijack attempt blows a hole in the ([[Boeing 747]]) airliner, Terry is sucked out to his death, and the terrorists parachute out of the same hole, taking Leedy with them.  Ex-DEA agent and renegade skydiver Ty Moncrief ([[Gary Busey]]) is the mastermind behind the attack, which culminated in the first ever parachute jump from a commercial jet at 30,000 feet. Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer in Washington DC so Ty can auction off the names of undercover agents to drug cartels worldwide. Ty has scheduled this to be accomplished during an Independence Day parachute exhibition and fireworks display, which is the one day every year when security is loosened around the airspace above Washington DC.  Pete believes that the assault may have been an elaborate prison break meant to free Leedy. However, the FBI declares that sneaking a parachute through airport security is impossible, and that parachuting at the jet's altitude and speed is not survivable. A devastated Pete is blamed for overreacting to the incident, and forced to turn in his badge.  Undeterred, Pete consults a U.S. Navy [[High-altitude military parachuting]] instructor who confirms that he and his team have parachuted from that height and speed, but also states that the high-density metal rings in the parachutes would not pass airport metal detectors and that the operation required either rare skills or suicidal recklessness. The instructor believes the world class skydiver Dominic Jagger ([[Luca Bercovici]]) could perform the jump, but does not know his current whereabouts. Pete is instead referred to Jagger's reckless ex-wife, ex-con Jessie Crossman ([[Yancy Butler]]) - who is unaware that Jagger is part of Ty's crew. Jessie agrees to train Pete how to skydive, if he will sponsor her team for the parachute exhibition. Soon after, Jagger is found dead, tangled in some high voltage power lines. Jesse breaks into the police impound to examine Jagger's parachute, declares that his death was a murder engineered by Ty, and swears revenge. Pete inquires as to the parachute's lack of metal, which Jesse explains is a custom "smuggler's rig" made with high density fabrics to deter radar.  When Pete discovers Ty's plan to hack into the DEA mainframe, the rest of the parachuting team agrees to help Pete with the situation. Jessie's parachuting friend Selkirk ([[Corin Nemec]]) is severely injured after using a faulty parachute that Ty had intended for Jessie to use. On the night of the Independence Day exhibition, Jessie sneaks into Ty's parachuting aircraft, holding them at gunpoint in order to determine an explanation for Jagger's death. But Ty's men kick her outside and then parachute out. Jessie, managing to grab hold of the aircraft door bar, lets go on a free fall just as Pete and the parachuting team arrive and rescue her, floating down safety to the roof of the DEA mainframe office building where Ty has already arrived.  Pete tries to find access to the DEA mainframe control room, eliminating Ty's men one by one, with the help of the parachuting team. He breaks in and holds Leedy (who has already started downloading the identities) as hostage. Ty, having kidnapped Jessie, appears and threatens to kill her unless Pete releases Leedy. A fight breaks out between Pete and Ty that results with both of them go falling out the building window. Luckily, Pete opens his emergency parachute as Ty tumbles to his death. Pete lands safely on the ground and is escorted away by paramedics, but spots Leedy wearing a DEA jacket leaving the scene. One of the team members, Swoop ([[Kyle Secor]]), leaps from the building, parachuting down onto Leedy and stopping him in his tracks. Pete tells Jessie jokingly that he would try skydiving again in forty or fifty years.  
Double Happiness (film)
 Jade Li ([[Sandra Oh]]) is a feisty, 22-year-old Chinese-Canadian aspiring actress who lives at home with her traditional Chinese family: her strict father (Stephen Chang), her dutiful mother (Alannah Ong), and her sweet younger sister, Pearl (Frances You). Their older brother, Winston, has been disowned—a fate Jade is not eager to share, both for her own sake and to spare her family pain.  Her family tries to put on the perfect public persona at all costs so as to maintain their dignity as well as uphold their traditional Chinese values. One primary part of this persona is prosperity. Jade's father hopes that true financial prosperity will become reality through penny stocks. Jade, meanwhile, tries to achieve that happy medium between giving in to her parents' wishes and fulfilling her own needs and desires - double happiness. Therefore, although she manages to land a few bit parts on camera, Jade spends most of her time working in the shop owned by a family friend, performing the duties of a respectful daughter and suffering through arranged dates with prosperous young Chinese men. An adept cultural chameleon, though, she also leads a double life, hanging out with best friend Lisa (Claudette Carracedo).  When her father's childhood friend arrives for a visit, Jade must juggle her competing identities even more carefully than usual, lest her choice of professions—and boyfriends—shame her father. Because of its instability, Jade's parents don't understand or widely publicize Jade's aspirations to be an actress. Their main want for Jade is to date and marry a nice Chinese boy, a goal for which Jade's extended family also strives as they are always trying to introduce her to Chinese boys. Initially, they believe that ''the'' boy is Andrew, with who Jade even agrees to go out. But Jade, beyond wanting to be an actress, wishes her family had more western sensibilities. She is attracted to a slightly awkward but persistent Caucasian English graduate student named Mark. Jade has to figure out how to both please her family, who would not approve of her dating a Caucasian, and be true to herself. Her older brother is already out of the picture for that very reason. Naturally, something must give sooner or later, and the facade of the perfect Chinese daughter soon begins to crumble.

Honest, experienced and diligent cops Abhay Singh ([[Om Puri]]) and Abbas Lodhi ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]) are part of the anti-terrorism task force set up by the government to eliminate the menace.  Abbas Lodhi comes up with the idea of "Operation Dhanush", which involves sending two undercover cops,  Anand ([[Manoj Bajpai]]) and Shiv ([[Milind Gunaji]]) among the terrorist group, so that they shall be part of them and learn all about them, and can call him through radio and transmit all the information under the code name Dhanush. Only Abbas and Abhay know about this operation.  Anand, one of the undercover cops, is exposed by the terrorists a few years later. However, he dies by consuming  [[cyanide]] before they can get any information from him. Now Shiv is left alone in the gang. He soon wins the trust and respect of everyone in the gang, including the mastermind Commander Bhadra ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]) himself.  Bhadra is captured and tortured by the police. But try as they may, he does not reveal anything to Abbas or Abhay. When Bhadra is in jail, the gang appoints one of their sharpshooters to kill a minister as he is approaching the city in his car, which he does successfully. This man is apprehended and interrogated by Abhay. He agrees to help the police for the safety of his family, but soon is poisoned in jail itself by a corrupt cop, Inspector Tiwari  ([[Shrivallabh Vyas]]).  Soon one of Abhay and Lodhi's trusted and highly respected officers, and good friends, IGP Pathak ([[Amrish Puri]]), commits suicide when the CBI come to arrest him on charges of being linked with the terrorists. This comes as a rude shock for Abhay and Lodhi. They now realize that there are people all over who seem to be linked with the terrorists. Now Bhadra offers Abhay the chance to join with and help the terrorists, or else his family will be in danger. Abhay does not oblige. The terrorists shoot the family dog, killing it, shoot at Abhay's son's leg and injure him, and send messages directly and indirectly to threaten him.  Abhay finally agrees. Bhadra asks for Abhay to sham a fake kidnap drama and allow him to escape, which he unwillingly does. Lodhi is shocked at Bhadra's escape, but he does not understand why Abhay is acting strangely.  Now outside, Bhadra soon send two people, Surinder ([[Annu Kapoor]]) and Mala to stay in Abhay's house, and asks the latter to accommodate them. The two of them keep Bhadra informed about everything, and threaten to kill Abhay's wife and child if he were to try anything funny at any time. Only Abhay knows about their true identity.  Soon Bhadra meets Abhay, and under threat of his wife and child being killed by Bhadra's signaling to the couple at their house, Abhay reveals that it was Lodhi who had arranged for two undercover cops to be sent to the gang, and only he knows 'who' Dhanush really is. Abhay also comes to know that Inspector Tiwari, who was supporting Bhadra, has been eliminated.  The gang attacks Lodhi. He almost starts to finish them off, when he sees that one of the people sent to capture him is Shiv, so he goes along with them. Lodhi is beaten, but he does not reveal who the [[inside man]] is. Soon he is killed accidentally by Bhadra's [[pistol]]. The shock of all that is happening is too much for Abhay to bear. He tells everything to Sumitra ([[Mita Vashisht]]), who tells Abhay that as a Police officer, he had taken an oath to protect the nation, and he must go by that. She also says that she will take care of everyone and everything if he were not there.  Consoled, Abhay is then called for a late night meeting by Bhadra again. When he leaves for Lodhi's house first, Surinder tries to attack and rape a girl being taken care of by Abhay and his wife. At this point, Mala orders Surinder at gunpoint to leave the girl, but Surinder shoots Mala. Sumitra sees all this, and in order to save him, seduces Surinder. Once in the bedroom, she pushes Surinder off, and kills him with her own gun.  Abhay Singh is informed and he returns home, and consoles his family and bids them goodbye. He goes to meet Bhadra, where he attacks the criminal and is overpowered and bound to a chair. With only Shiv in the room, Commander Bhadra asks Abhay about the inside man, and suddenly points the pistol at Shiv. Abhay jumps off, attacks Bhadra, breaks free and stabs him in the neck with the broken wood of the chair. On hearing the commotion, as the entire gang comes from outside to break into the room, Abhay tells Shiv to shoot him, because then it will appear as though Abhay was killed when he attacked Bhadra, and Shiv being highly trusted, would become the new gang leader. A reluctant Shiv does so, just as the gang breaks in. Shiv declares himself to be the terrorist gang leader, and the others accept his leadership. Abhay Singh passes away in peace.

Ed Wood (film)
 In 1952, [[Ed Wood]] is struggling to join the [[film industry]]. Upon hearing of an announcement in [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'' magazine]] that producer [[George Weiss (producer)|George Weiss]] is trying to purchase [[Christine Jorgensen]]'s [[Film rights#Life rights|life story]], Wood wants to meet Weiss. Weiss explains that ''Variety''s announcement was a [[news leak]], and it is impossible to purchase Jorgensen's rights. The producer decides to fictionalize the film, titled ''I Changed My Sex!''. Wood tries to convince Weiss that he is perfect to direct the film, owing to the fact that he himself is a closeted [[transvestite]] and knows what it's like to live with a secret and worry what people might think, but is unsuccessful since Weiss wants a director with experience. Wood meets his longtime idol [[Bela Lugosi]] and the two become friends. Wood persuades Weiss to let him direct the film by convincing him that having a star in the film would sell tickets, and they could sign Lugosi for a low price.  Wood and Weiss argue over the film's title and subject matter: Weiss has the poster printed, which Wood changes to ''[[Glen or Glenda]]'' and writes the film about a transvestite rather than a [[sex change]]. Weiss allows Wood to shoot whatever he wants as long as the film meets the required length. Wood takes to film production with an unusual approach; shooting only one take per scene, giving actors very little direction and using stock footage to fill in gaps. The movie is released to critical and commercial failure. Because of this, Wood is unsuccessful in getting a job at Weiss' Screen Classics or making a partnership with [[Warner Bros.]] executive Feldman, but his girlfriend, [[Dolores Fuller]], tells him that he should try [[Independent film|financing his next film independently]]. Wood is unsuccessful in finding money for ''Bride of the Atom'', but is introduced to the psychic [[The Amazing Criswell]] who gives him advice on how to sell himself better.  Wood meets [[Loretta King Hadler|Loretta King]], whom he thinks has enough money to fund ''Bride of the Atom'' and ends up casting her as the lead instead of Fuller as planned. Filming begins, but is halted when it is revealed that King is actually poor, and Wood has no money to continue production. Wood convinces [[meat packing industry]] tycoon Don McCoy to take over funding the film, who agrees as long as the film stars his son Tony as the [[leading man]] and the film ends with an explosion. The filming finishes with the title being changed to ''[[Bride of the Monster]]'', but Fuller breaks up with Wood after the [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrap party]] because of his circle of friends, his work, and transvestism. Lugosi attempts to conduct a double suicide with Ed after the government cuts off his [[unemployment]], but is talked out of it. Lugosi checks himself into [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]], and Wood meets Kathy O'Hara, who is visiting her father there. He takes her on a date and reveals to her his transvestism, which she accepts.  Wood shoots a film with Lugosi outside his home. When Wood and company attend the premiere for ''Bride of the Monster'', an angry mob chases them out of the theater. Lugosi passes away, leaving Wood without a star. Wood convinces his landlord, a church leader named Reynolds, that funding Wood's script for ''Grave Robbers from Outer Space'' would result in a [[box office]] success, and generate enough money for Reynolds' dream project. Dr. [[Tom Mason]], O'Hara's [[chiropractic|chiropractor]], is chosen to be Lugosi's [[stand-in]] for resembling Lugosi. Wood and the Baptists have conflicts over the title and content of the script which they want to have changed to ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]],'' along with Ed's [[B movie]] directing style, his casting decisions and his transvestism. Wood leaves the set to go to the nearest [[bar (establishment)|bar]], where he encounters his idol, [[Orson Welles]]. Filming for ''Plan 9'' finishes with Ed taking action against his producers. After attending the premiere of ''Plan 9'', Wood and O'Hara go to [[Las Vegas]] to get married.  
Dumb and Dumber
 Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne, two kindly but dimwitted men, are best friends and roommates living in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. Lloyd, a chip-toothed limousine driver, [[Love at first sight|immediately falls in love]] when he meets Mary Swanson, a woman he is driving to the airport. She leaves a briefcase in the terminal; Lloyd, unaware that it contains ransom money for her kidnapped husband, Bobby, and that she was supposed to leave it there for the kidnappers to pick up, retrieves it and tries to return it to her before the kidnappers can get it. Her [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]]-bound plane has already departed, leading to Lloyd running through and falling out of the [[jetway]].  Fired from his job, Lloyd returns to his apartment and learns that Harry has also been fired from his dog-grooming job after delivering dogs late to a show and accidentally getting them dirty. Bobby's kidnappers, Joe "Mental" Mentalino and J. P. Shay, follow Lloyd home from the airport in pursuit of the briefcase. Mistaking the crooks for debt collectors, the duo flee the apartment and return later to find that Mental has decapitated Harry's [[parakeet]]. Lloyd suggests they head to Aspen to find Mary and return the briefcase, hoping she can "plug them into the social pipeline." At first, Harry opposes the idea, but he eventually agrees and the duo leaves the next day.   Mental and Shay catch up to the duo at a motel that night. Posing as a hitchhiker, Mental is picked up by Harry and Lloyd while Shay secretly follows them. During a lunch stop, the duo prank Mental with chili peppers in his burger, not knowing of his [[ulcer]]. When Mental reacts adversely, they accidentally kill him with rat poison pills (which he planned to use on them) after mistaking it for his medication. Nearing Colorado, Lloyd takes a wrong turn and ends up driving all night through [[Nebraska]], while the police waiting on the road to Colorado expect them to show up after finding out about Mental's death. Upon waking up and realizing Lloyd's mishap, Harry gives up on the journey and decides to walk home, but Lloyd later persuades him to continue after trading the van for a [[minibike]].  The two arrive in Aspen, but are unable to locate Mary. After a short scuffle over some gloves that night, the briefcase breaks open and they discover the money; they spend it for a hotel suite, clothes and a [[Lamborghini Diablo]]. They learn that Mary and her family are hosting a gala and prepare to attend. At the gala, Harry, attempting to lure Mary over to Lloyd, reluctantly agrees to go skiing with her the next day and lies to Lloyd that he got him a date. The next day, Lloyd finds out Harry lied to him after waiting all day for Mary at the hotel bar.  In retaliation, Lloyd pranks Harry by serving him a coffee laced with [[laxative]], causing Harry to spontaneously defecate in a broken toilet at Mary's house. Lloyd arrives at Mary's house and informs her that he has her briefcase. He takes her to the hotel, shows her the briefcase, and confesses his love after some initial struggle; she rejects him, as she is already married. Nicholas Andre, an old friend of the Swansons and the mastermind behind Bobby's kidnapping, arrives with Shay and, upon learning that Lloyd and Harry had spent all of the ransom money and replaced it with [[IOU]]s, takes Lloyd and Mary hostage, as well as Harry when he returns. An argument leads Nicholas to shoot Harry. Before Nicholas can kill them, an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] team led by Beth Jordan (whom Harry met earlier at a gas station) raids the suite and arrests him and Shay. Harry is revealed to be alive thanks to a bulletproof vest that was strapped on him earlier. Mary and Bobby are reunited. Lloyd, jealous that he can never be with Mary because she is married, fantasizes about shooting Bobby dead.   The next day, Harry and Lloyd begin walking home. All of the items they bought were confiscated and their minibike has broken down. The two unknowingly decline the chance to be oil boys for a group of bikini girls, after which Harry tells Lloyd that they will get their "break" one day. Harry and Lloyd then play a friendly game of [[Tag (game)|tag]] as they walk back home.  
Eat Drink Man Woman

Each Sunday Mr. Chu makes a glorious banquet for his daughters, but the dinner table is also the family forum, or perhaps “torture chamber,” to which each daughter brings “announcements” as they negotiate the transition from traditional “father knows best” style to a new tradition which encompasses old values in new forms.  As the film progresses, each daughter encounters new men. When these new relationships blossom, their roles are broken and the living situation within the family changes. The father eventually brings the greatest surprise, marrying Liang Jin-Rong.  
Drunken Master II
 The story begins in early 20th century China at a crowded train station, with Wong Fei-hung ([[Jackie Chan]]), his father, Dr. Wong Kei-ying ([[Ti Lung]]), and the family servant, Tso (Ram Cheung), waiting in line. Fei-hung is angry about having to pay a [[Duty (economics)|duty]] on the [[ginseng]] that Kei-ying is bringing back for a client. Disobeying his father, Fei-hung hides the ginseng in the suitcase of an employee of the British [[Consul (representative)|consul]] to avoid the tax (as Consul workers are exempt from duties).  When the train makes a stop, Fei-hung and Tso create a diversion to sneak into the first class section (filled with members of the British Consulate and the British Ambassador) to retrieve the ginseng. When Fei-hung gets to the first class luggage car, he spots a [[Manchuria]]n officer ([[Lau Kar-leung]]) stealing an unknown item that is in a similar package as the ginseng. Fei-hung tries to speak with him but the officer hits him. However, Fei-hung retrieves the ginseng, and pursues the officer in revenge for hitting him. A long fight between them ensues under the train, during which the officer calls him a "henchman". Puzzled, Fei-hung angrily tells the officer that he is not a henchman and challenges him to a hand-to-hand kung fu fight. Fei-hung uses his [[Zui Quan]] (Drunken Boxing) style of martial arts on him, but it proves ineffective. After the fight, the officer tells Fei-hung that his drunken boxing is slow and powerless. When Fei-hung returns to the train, the Manchurian officer opens the box he stole, only to realize that he accidentally stole the Wongs' ginseng.  Meanwhile, on the train, guards of the British Consulate search for the stolen box and they ask the Wongs to show them their items. Fei-hung discovers that what he thought was his father's ginseng was actually a valuable Chinese antique. But before the officers discover it, a sympathetic son of a Northeast Chinese general ([[Andy Lau]]) uses his influence to intervene (in both English dubbed versions, the man is actually a [[counterintelligence]] officer). Later, its revealed that the British ambassador (Louis Roth) is corrupt and involved in an operation to smuggle and sell ancient Chinese artifacts. However, buyers won't purchase the collection without the missing Emperor's [[Jade Seal]] (the artifact now in Fei-hung's possession). Then he sends his henchman, John ([[Ken Lo]]) and Henry ([[Ho-Sung Pak]]), to make the workers at a local steel factory work overtime without pay. When the workers refuse, Henry physically overpowers the workers and forces them to submit to the overtime working orders.  When the Wongs return home from their train ride, trouble brews for Fei-hung when his father's client, Mr. Chan, comes to retrieve the ginseng root. Fei-hung takes the root of his father's prized ancient [[bonsai]] tree, discreetly gives it to Mr. Chan and tells him that it is the ginseng. Knowing that the bonsai tree root could be deadly for Mr. Chan if he decides to brew it, Fei-hung's step-mom, Ling ([[Anita Mui]]) decides to temporarily loan her necklace to one of her friends in exchange for some money to buy ginseng. This leads some of Master Wong's friends to believe that the Wongs are having financial troubles, and they offer him a collection, which a confused Master Wong declines. Meanwhile, Fei-hung and Ling do not realize that Henry and his men are following them, having (correctly) suspected Fei-hung of stealing the jade seal. Assuming that the bag Ling and Fei-hung are carrying is the stolen artifact (although it's actually Ling's necklace), they attempt to steal the bag, which starts a fight between Fei-hung vs. Henry and his men. During the fight, Ling encourages Fei-hung to use drunken boxing against them to impress the crowd and gain publicity for the Wongs' school, Po Chi Lam. She and her friends take a bunch of alcohol from a country club and give it to Fei-hung, which allows him to do drunken boxing properly, and then he impressively defeats Henry and his henchmen in front of the crowd. However, Master Wong Kei-ying arrives as the fight ends, and Fei-hung's drunken behavior embarrasses the family. He takes his son and wife home and lectures them, saying they are destroying his reputation by fighting and drinking in public, and for making others believe that they are broke. He beats Fei-hung for fighting and using drunken boxing (which Master Wong forbids). To make matters worse, Mr. Chan's wife comes by to tell Kei-ying that her husband is very sick from the bonsai tree root (which is poisonous if consumed). An infuriated Master Wong beats Fei-hung even more and disowns him, kicking him out of the house.  Fei-hung goes to a restaurant and drinks heavily in sorrow. John arrives with a beaten Henry and the rest of the henchman from earlier to confront him. Fei-hung is now clearly too drunk to fight, and John beats him. Fishmonger Tsang ([[Felix Wong]]), a fellow [[Choy Li Fut]] instructor and friend of Fei-hung, arrives and tries to intervene, but is unable to when a vat of hot liquid he was carrying spills on him. The next morning, Fei-hung and Tsang are found knocked out beaten, with Fei-hung stripped with a banner hanging from him that says "King of Drunken Boxing." Master Wong brings Fei-hung back into the home, and explains that the reason why he forbids drunken boxing is because it is difficult for drunken boxers to find the right balance of alcohol consumption. The following night, the Manchurian officer from the train arrives at the Wong's residence to speak to Fei-hung. Master Wong recognizes him as Master Fu Wen-chi, the "last decorated [[Manchu]] officer." The next day at a restaurant, Master Fu explains to Fei-hung that the artifact that ended up in Fei-hung's possession (and what Master Fu meant to steal from the train) was the Emperor's Jade seal. He tells him about the theft of precious ancient Chinese artifacts by foreigners and asks him for help in stopping it, which Fei-Hung agrees to do. Moments later, an enormous gang of axe-wielding thugs (known as the Axe Gang), apparently paid for by the British Consulate, try to kill them. After a long fight, Fei-hung and Master Fu make an escape, and Fishmonger Tsang, Fun, and Tsang's student, Marlon (Lau Ka-yung) join the fight, as they recognize Master Fu. But a British consulate guard fatally shoots Master Fu when he runs down an alley, and they take back the Jade seal. Fu Wen-chi pleads with them to get it back before dying.  The following night, both Tsang and Fei-hung break into the consulate disguised as consulate guards to retrieve the Jade seal, but are both eventually caught. They are jailed, beaten, and held for ransom by the British Ambassador, who demands that Wong Kei-ying sells the land where Po Chi Lam and Fishmonger Tsang's schools are. Master Wong reluctantly agrees to do so and the Consulate releases Fei-hung and Tsang. Then, the ambassador orders the steel mill to be closed down and for all of the steel shipments to be sent to Hong Kong. Angry, steelworkers Fo-sang ([[Chin Kar-lok]]) and a man named Uncle Hing (Hon Yee-sang) break into the steel mill later that night to find out what the British are up to, and they discover the steel shipment boxes are filled with ancient Chinese artifacts. However, they are caught and they fight the consulate's henchman. Fo-sang escapes and informs Fei-hung and Ling about what is happening.  Later, Fei-hung, Tsang, Fun, and Marlon arrive at the factory where the workers are staging a protest that becomes violent against the Consulate's abuses. Once inside the factory, Fei-hung takes on all of the henchmen until only Henry and John are left. Fei-hung easily fights off Henry but John proves to be a tough opponent due to his fast and unpredictable kicks. When John and Henry gain the upper hand and are about to finish him off, Fei-hung uses the industrial alcohol in the steel mill to light Henry on fire, and then drinks it. Disposing of Henry, Fei-hung defeats John in a wild fight scene with his drunken boxing.  Later, the Wongs are rewarded by a Chinese general for their help in stopping the British Consulate's crimes, which includes a sum of money and the return of Tsang's and Wong's schools.

Although the first depicted beating lasts less than 3 minutes of screen time, the actual beating it was based on allegedly lasted a gruelling 7 hours.  Initially Dale submits to the psychological and physical traumas of his situation. By day they attempt to break his spirit and sanity by forcing him to smash blue-stone with a pick, invoking images of Australia's convict heritage, while another inmate is compelled to perform more demeaning behaviour such as licking [[faeces]] off toilet doors. Gradually Dale becomes indifferent to the bashings and horrors of prison life and develops an alternative, subversive way to exist and express his rage.  At one point Dale is depicted pacing his cell naked and mumbling incoherently. It seems as if the ego shattering experience has forced him to the verge of insanity. It's not until he claims : "I've resigned from this life" and urges the other inmates to do so as well, that we see method in his madness. By refusing to play the dehumanising prison game anymore the guards have lost their threat of psychological and physical suppression over him and he in turn has reaffirmed the power of the simple utterance of which he can never be deprived. Although contact between the inmates is strictly forbidden at night they manage to shout and finally communicate through the prison walls. "Unity in adversity!", Dale shouts beginning a chant which reverberates throughout the cells. Meanwhile, Berriman, realising the threat of pure violence or psychological abuse is no longer effective starts to panic.

Her efforts to earn enough money damages her health and her relationship with her family.  The film demonstrates new trends and changes the Chinese society during the reform era and the different attitudes between those who joined the capitalist race and those who remained behind. Ermo becomes a wise merchant (even if she only sells dry noodles) and a consumer full of aspirations, while her elder husband still drinks his Chinese medicine and sees himself as the former head of village, a role which was meaningful during the Mao era. While Ermo is becoming more and more attracted to Xiazi, her business-oriented neighbor, and the lifestyle he represents, her husband remains impotent, both physically and metaphorically. As the film progresses it is evident that the competent capitalist-minded characters also do not find satisfaction, though it is also clear that those who don't join the race are completely irrelevant in the modern society.

Ernest Goes to School
 Ernest ([[Jim Varney]]) works as a janitor at Chickasaw Falls High School, which is facing closure due to the school board's decision to merge other schools in the area. There is also a new rule: All employees are required to have a high school diploma, which Ernest lacks due to an incomplete high school transcript.  Ernest has two choices as a result: Resign or go through the twelfth grade. Ernest reluctantly decides to redo school and enters the student body, attending regular classes and performing usual student activities, but all not with a little catastrophe or predicament or distraction.  Soon the principal tells him he's failing and that he may as well forget about the experiment. As Ernest is off sulking about it, two science teachers show up in his locker to reveal their biggest experiment to him - a potential brain accelerator. They make Ernest their "Human Guinea Pig" and see what happens.  The experiment is successful and Ernest becomes significantly smart. He is extremely proficient at virtually everything from mathematics to drama to music. The only downside is that his personality turns snobbish and superior, alienating him from his friends. He impresses his teachers and it seems he is well on the way to graduating with top marks.  While Ernest is doing well, Ms. Flugal, who is Ernest's love interest in the film, makes him band conductor and puts him in charge of directing the marching band in preparation for the halftime show during the football game. Ernest diligently does so and instructs the whole band to watch him if anything wrong happens. This rule is very instrumental in the ending result.  Eventually, two bullies find out about Ernest's secret by watching him descend into his locker to recharge his intelligence. They in turn destroy the accelerator right before the night of the football game. The whole procession is ultimately ruined when Ernest realizes he can't recharge and has to direct the band with his usual mind and intelligence. He spends the whole disastrous affair with his head inserted in a tuba which resulted after he descended toward the band from the podium in his clumsiness. He in turn disappoints the band, the audience who had to run from the resulting fire, the principal, and most of all, Ms. Flugal.  Depressed, with the knowledge that he can't recharge his head any more, Ernest starts packing his things until he finds three of his friends mocking him. They force Ernest haplessly through days of study for the final exam, but Ernest proves hopeless, though his friends continue to help him. On the day of the big exam, Ernest is about to go in, but before he does, the scientists return and tell him excitedly that the brain accelerator has been repaired. Feeling for his friends who labored with him all that time, he declines to use the machine and takes the exam on his own.   During the final part of the movie, the football game finals take place. During the game, the board inspector, who personally wants the merger to happen, bribes the football coach into purposely losing the game against the rival team. As a school board member is in the audience, the forthcoming loss will likely convince the board the merger must happen. The coach accepts, resulting in the football team losing every play. Meanwhile, Ernest is still in charge in the marching band. Using his own ideas, he comes up with small routines during the halftime show. On the other hand, other members of the band are informed of the fix on the game and sneak off. With the help of the two science teachers, they infiltrate the locker room with sleeping gas, effectively replacing the football team to win the game themselves. During the game between the rival team and the replacements, the two scientists reveal to Ernest their new brain accelerator. He immediately charges up and becomes the coach for the team. With his new intelligent strategies, the tide turns and they start winning.  However, in the last play of the game, Ernest forgets to recharge and loses his intelligence while in play. He ends up rolling down field on a drum after the ball that was thrown and flies into the end zone, catching it. The team wins just as the football players arrive from the locker room in bewilderment and the board trustee is informed of the inspector's actions and intentions and the coach's involvement.  In the end, the school stays open (they won the football game) and both the coach and the inspector get fired. It is also revealed Ernest passed the final exam, so he earns his high school diploma and is permitted to keep his job.

The Jeweler would then give the real diamond to the blind artist [[Alicia Masters]] ([[Kat Green]]), who was also kidnapped by homeless henchmen working for the Jeweler. The Jeweler wants Alicia to be his bride, with the diamond as his wedding present to her. However, Doom and his henchmen locate the Jeweler's lair. Doom's henchmen first try to make a deal with him, to no avail. Doom, displeased, seizes the diamond and threatens to kill Alicia, whereupon Ben enters the room, only to revert to human form. Pursued by Doom, Ben runs out onto the city streets, frustrated at his helplessness. He somehow reverts to the Thing.  A gunfight ensues between Doom and the Jeweler's men. Doom takes the diamond to power a laser cannon that will destroy [[New York City]]. Ben returns to his friends; by now, Reed has learned that Doom is actually Victor. Realizing they are the only ones who can stop Doom, they don costumes and travel to Doom's castle. There, the Fantastic Four battle a series of Doom's military. Reed has a final battle with Doom, which ends with Doom supposedly committing suicide, though after falling into the fog, his glove, still on the balcony, starts to move. Johnny becomes the Human Torch to stand between the laser cannon's shot and the city, pushing the beam into outer space. Ben frees Alicia and finally introduces himself to her. She feels the rocky surface of his face but is not fazed by his altered appearance. Thereafter, the Four dedicate themselves to fighting evil, and Reed and Sue marry.

Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture
   While exploring a cavern in [[Egypt]], [[List of Fatal Fury characters#Cheng Sinzan|Cheng Sinzan]] discovers a leg armor plate said to be one of six pieces of the Armor of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. Cheng is defeated by Laocorn Gaudeamus and his three henchmen before Laocorn attaches the part to his body and destroys the cavern. In Japan, [[Joe Higashi]] makes his triumphant return into the ring by defeating Thai champion [[List of Fatal Fury characters#Hwa Jai|Hwa Jai]] after the events of ''[[Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle]]''. Joe reunites with [[Terry Bogard|Terry]] and [[Andy Bogard]], as well as [[Mai Shiranui]]. While being chased by a masked assailant, Sulia Gaudeamus - Laocorn's sister - befriends Terry. After [[List of Fatal Fury characters#Raiden|Big Bear]] is knocked unconscious by the assailant, [[Kim Kaphwan]] defeats him, exposing the assailant as Cheng. Sulia reveals that she has searched for Terry since his battle with Krauser. Sulia, Terry, Andy, Mai and Joe travel to [[Rhodes]], where Sulia reveals that she is a descendent of Gaudeamus, a powerful warrior whose armor drew fear among [[Alexander the Great]]. One night, Alexander killed Gaudeamus, but the armor gained life after his death, and reincarnated himself as Mars before destroying a city; it was eventually defeated by four warriors. To prevent Mars from destroying cities again, the armor was broken up and hidden in different places around the world. On the island, the five discover a series of cave paintings that indicate that martial arts moves such as [[List of Fatal Fury characters#Tung Fu Rue|Tung Fu Rue]]'s Hurricane Punch and Krauser's Blitz Ball were influenced by Gaudeamus. Sulia reveals that she possesses healing powers due to her heritage and shares a mental bond with Laocorn. After Sulia discovers the locations of two of the three remaining armor pieces, the group divides into two subgroups in an attempt to find them.  While searching for the breast plate in [[Turkey]], Terry, Joe and Sulia discover an ancient chamber, which was unearthed in the police station's destruction. The three discover that the breast plate is in Stroheim Castle, Krauser's former home. Joe is sent to [[Baghdad]] to rendezvous with Andy and Mai. Having realized that the breast plate is in Stroheim Castle in [[Germany]], Terry and Sulia travel to the castle, but are confronted by Laocorn's henchman Jamin. Terry is severely injured after using the Power Geyser attack to escape. At the castle, Panni, Laocorn's henchwoman, defeats Krauser's former henchman [[List of Fatal Fury characters#Laurence Blood|Laurence Blood]] and acquires the breast plate from the castle. In [[Iraq]], Andy and Mai find out that the site of the leg armor was raided when the [[Mongolia]]ns [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|sacked Baghdad]] and brought their loot back to [[China]]. They figure that Tung Fu Rue knew the location of the armor piece before he died, and their next lead would be Tung's old friend [[List of Fatal Fury characters#Jubei Yamada|Jubei Yamada]].  Sulia heals Terry using part of her life force. Terry, hears from Sulia that her and Laocorn's father was leading an expedition to find the Armor of Mars after discovering the first piece - the right gauntlet. Then one day, a business partner killed the twins' father. After Laocorn was shot by the murderer, he used the armor to kill the murderer. Since then, Laocorn developed an insatiable desire to complete the armor. Hearing the story, Terry vows to fight to protect Sulia from any pain or suffering. In Japan, Andy and Mai go to [[List of Fatal Fury characters#Duck King|Duck King]]'s nightclub, where they have arranged to meet with Jubei. As Jubei gives Andy the location of the leg armor, Andy confronts [[Geese Howard]]'s staff-wielding henchman [[Billy Kane]], but is interrupted by the appearance of Laocorn's third henchman, Hauer. After unsuccessfully trying to seduce and bring Mai to his side, Hauer destroys the nightclub. The next day, Billy reports the confrontation to Geese. Geese, however, dismisses it as trivial information. In China, Andy retrieves the leg armor when he and Mai are attacked by Hauer, who defeats them and steals the armor piece. The five regroup in Rhodes, where Sulia tells them that Laocorn has not found the crown - the sixth armor piece. They discover a secret chamber behind the cave paintings and use Sulia's pendant to reveal the [[Dead Sea]] in [[Israel]] as the location of the final piece.  In [[Jerusalem]], while Andy is away practicing his techniques, Terry and Joe are knocked unconscious while Mai and Sulia are cornered by Laocorn and his henchmen. Sulia agrees to go with her twin brother if he promises not to harm her friends. Laocorn, Sulia and Jamin flee, but Hauer and Panni are easily defeated by Andy and Mai. The heroes head for the Dead Sea, where Laocorn raises an ancient temple. While Andy, Joe and Mai confront an army of Laocorn's masked thugs at the temple, Terry runs toward the entrance and defeats Jamin with his Burning Knuckle technique. He explains that he sees the bond between Terry and Sulia, and that Terry is the only one who can save her and Laocorn.  Laocorn finds the armor's crown, mounted on a statue of Mars. Over Sulia and Terry's objections, Laocorn crowns himself - causing the armor to encase him in [[vermeil]] and augment all of his powers and abilities. Andy, Joe and Mai join in the fight, but are overpowered by Laocorn's newly acquired powers. Then, just when Laocorn is about to finish off the heroes, Sulia stabs her own arm to injure Laocorn. As his abilities have become more powerful, so has his mental bond with his sister. Sulia stabs herself in the heart, causing more pain to Laocorn. Before succumbing to her wounds, Sulia tells Terry to strike Laocorn's breast plate. Terry uses his Burning Knuckle technique to defeat Laocorn and reduce his armor to four coins. The coins assimilate into the statue of Mars, bringing it to life. Realizing that the armor was using him to bring Mars back to life, Laocorn sacrifices himself to save Mai. Terry absorbs the last of Sulia's lifeforce, combining it with his skills to attack Mars head-on. Terry uses the Buster Wolf technique to defeat Mars and he, Mai, Andy and Joe escape the temple. The film ends with Terry throwing his hat in silence.  
Farinelli (film)
  The prologue begins with Carlo Broschi, the famous castrato Farinelli, reminiscing about his childhood as a singer in the church choir. A newly castrated boy runs in and warns Carlo to stop singing, warning that his voice will result in death, before killing himself. Carlo is traumatized and confused by this that he is then unwilling to sing a composition made by his brother Riccardo when told to by his voice teacher, Nicola Porpora later during his voice lessons. He cries and runs off asking why the castrato had to die. Carlo's father comforts him, and makes him promise that he will never refuse his voice to his brother ever again.  The film opens in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], at the palace of [[Philip V of Spain|King Philip V]]. Riccardo Broschi (Enrico Lo Verso) demands to see his younger brother, the Italian castrato Carlo Broschi (Stefano Dionisi), better known by his nickname, Farinelli. Carlo doesn't acknowledge him.  The rest of the film is told in flashback. Eighteen years earlier, Carlo and Riccardo watched as an itinerant trumpet player humiliated a young [[castrato]]. Angered, Carlo humiliates the trumpeter in turn. The crowd gives Carlo the nickname "Farinelli". In the crowd there is a pretty lady that Riccardo approaches in order to seduce her, using his brother as "bait". In a nearby tent, Carlo begins to make love to the woman and then Riccardo steps in to complete the act. Meanwhile, [[George Frideric Händel]] ([[Jeroen Krabbé]]) has heard Farinelli sing from his carriage. He asks Carlo to come to [[England]] and perform, but Riccardo demands to be included. Handel sneers at Riccardo as a hack, and humiliates Carlo as a freak, leaving Carlo despondent and Riccardo angry.  Several years pass, and Carlo is now famous. He even impresses the Comtesse Mauer (Marianne Basler), a beautiful and rich young woman more interested in books than opera. The brothers maintain their sexual accommodation: Carlo seduces the comtesse´s maid, whereas Riccardo consummates the [[sex act]], but refuses to engage in a sexual relationship or to sing for the comtesse. Carlo receives a letter from Handel, who says he intends to hear Carlo sing in [[Dresden]]. Before arriving, Carlo suddenly falls ill with a fever. While he is ill, Riccardo tells him the story Carlo has always believed about how he became a castrato—that he had been injured in a fall from a horse, making the castration surgery necessary to save his life. In Dresden, Handel meets with Carlo just before the curtain rises, and tells him the King of England wants him to sing. Unnerved by Handel's offer, Carlo faints on stage. A self-satisfied Handel leaves, leaving Carlo waiting for him in vain.  Carlo is soon thereafter contacted by the young Alexandra Harris (Elsa Zylberstein), and asked to come to [[London]]. Handel's [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] opera house is bankrupting the nearby Nobles Theatre, which is run by Carlo's old vocal teacher, Nicola Porpora (Omero Antonutti). Carlo and Riccardo journey to London. Carlo meets Margareth Hunter (Caroline Cellier), and Benedict (Renaud du Peloux de Saint Romain), Margareth's crippled son. Carlo begins to take an interest on Margareth, and dotes on Benedict. However, when Carlo proposed to Margareth, she refuses, out of respect for her late husband. Carlo begins to feel empty and realizes that Riccardo's compositions are full of ornaments and lacking true artistry, he begins to covet Handel's operas and tries to impress him, but Alexandra, who is in love with Carlo, steals some of Handel's music for Carlo to perform. Riccardo's music is vastly inferior to Handel's, and the relationship between the two brothers deteriorates. Searching his house for his stolen music, Handel hears Riccardo composing. He confronts Riccardo, insinuating that the composer would be better off without Farinelli. Beguiled by Handel, Riccardo reveals (in a flashback-within-a-flashback) that Carlo was a superb singer as a child, and when their father died, Carlo was seriously ill, the fear of losing that voice prompted him to drug Carlo, tell him a story of how he fell off a horse and castrated him illegally, and to soothe him for his loss, Riccardo would compose the greatest opera for Carlo to sing: "Orpheus".  That evening, Handel meets with Farinelli backstage. He tells Farinelli the secret of his castration and allowing him to sing his stolen music. Heartbroken by this revelation, Carlo sings Handel's music (the aria ''[[Lascia ch'io pianga]]'' <ref>Haynes, Bruce, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MCJArhvspfEC&pg=PA25&dq=farinelli+lascia+ch%27io+pianga ''The End of Early Music''], Oxford University Press US, 2007, p. 25. </ref>) so beautifully that Handel faints.  The flashback ends. The audience learns that Carlo fled from Riccardo with Alexandra to the court of Spain, and has not sung in public since his triumph at the Nobles Theater three years earlier. Carlo has never forgiven Riccardo for [[castrating]] him, but Alexandra, who understand the bond between the brothers, tries to reconcile them, she steals "Orpheus", the opera that Riccardo promised Carlo to create. Carlo recognizes that the opera is the best masterpiece ever written by Riccardo, something he longed for, however he hasn't forgiven him. Carlo sings for King Philip during a [[solar eclipse]]. Overwhelmed by the pain of his guilt and the broken relationship with his brother, Riccardo slashes his wrist in a [[suicide attempt]] as he listens to Carlo sing during the solar eclipse. After falling unconscious from [[blood loss]], he is brought to the house Carlo and Alexandra share, where he recovers. Carlo, realizing that there is no greater atonement for his brother's actions, forgives Riccardo for [[castrating]] him. Together, the brothers [[Sexual intercourse|make love]] to Alexandra.  Some months pass. Alexandra is now [[pregnant]] with Riccardo's child, whom Carlo and Alexandra treat as their own. The film ends as Riccardo leaves Madrid to seek his fortune as a composer, taking comfort in the fact that in leaving Carlo with a child to father, he has given his brother back his "share of humanity."  
Family Album (miniseries)
 Starting in 1951, Faye Price is a famous Hollywood actress who, while entertaining the troops during the [[Korean War]], falls in love with Ward Thayer, a rich heir. Seven years later, they are married, with four children. Ward loses his job and considers [[suicide]], but Faye offers to start acting again. Originally, this upsets Ward, because he was not fond of moving to [[Fairfax, California]]. On the set of her new movie, the director and producer fight each other and the director eventually leaves the set. Faye offers to direct the scene herself. At first, nobody thinks she will be able to, but she turns out to direct the scene with a lot of success. She is soon offered directing jobs at television series, including ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater|Zane Grey Theater]]''. Meanwhile, her home life is less fortunate. Ward has been depressed since going bankrupt and he has started an affair. When Faye finds out, she immediately kicks him out of the house. However, she soon agrees to give him another chance and they decide to work together on films as director and producer.

Ward, however, is outraged and cuts him out of his life, with forbidding his other children to ever contact him again. Anne is furious and decides to [[Runaway youth|run away]]. Faye is devastated, but can't afford to quit her job and look for her. Soon, Greg announces he will serve for the army in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. The entire family comes together to say goodbye, but Ward refuses to speak to Lionel. Later, Faye receives a phone call from the police, informing her that Anne has been arrested for drug possession.

Anne feels guilty for not having apologized, but Ward assures her that Faye knew how much she loved her.  
Fear of a Black Hat
 The film is a comedic [[mockumentary]] depicting the perspective of a filmmaker as she trails a hardcore [[gangsta rap]] group called N.W.H. ("Niggaz With Hats"), a play on the name of the popular group [[N.W.A]] In many ways, ''Fear of a Black Hat'' is similar to the [[satire|satirical]] film about early 1980s [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] ''[[This is Spinal Tap]]''.  The members of N.W.H. are: *Ice Cold (Cundieff), the main rapper and the intelligent and vulgar backbone of the group.  *Tasty Taste ([[Larry B. Scott]]), the ultra-violent secondary rapper who always seems to be armed with a variety of dangerous assault weaponry.  (His name is spelled "Tasty-Taste" in the credits but not in other parts of the movie.) *Tone Def ([[Mark Christopher Lawrence]]), the [[esotericism|esoteric]] [[Disc jockey#Hip Hop disc jockeys|D.J.]], who is talented enough to scratch with his butt and his penis (the latter is not shown directly, but strongly and humorously implied).  (His name is spelled "Tone-Def" in the credits but not in other parts of the movie.)  The film is told from the point of view of Nina Blackburn ([[Kasi Lemmons]]), a [[sociologist]] who analyzes hip hop as a form of [[communication]] for her degree. She chooses N.W.H. as the subject of her [[thesis]] and follows them around for a year. She familiarizes herself with the band members, their beliefs, and their often strange behavior.  The members wear outrageous headwear during their performances. This is explained as an act of rebellion, remembering their [[slavery|slave]] ancestors, who had to work bare-headed in the sun. According to N.W.H., hats are a symbol for resistance and revolution since their hatless ancestors were too tired from working all day in the sun to revolt. This is a typical example of the bizarre logic the group uses to explain the deeper meanings behind their otherwise crude and base music and images.  A steady source of comedy is N.W.H.'s use of over-the-top graphic language (e.g. sex, violence and rantings against the police), which detractors see as a cheap means to sell records, but in their eyes is essential to convey a "socially relevant message". They offer jaw-dropping explanations why songs such as "Booty Juice" and "Come and Pet the P.U.S.S.Y." are in fact deep and socially significant, and that detractors obviously do not truly understand the "real meaning". Throughout the movie, it is difficult to tell if the members of N.W.H. truly believe what they are saying, or are just portraying an image.  A lot of time also goes into describing N.W.H.'s feud with another rap group, the Jam Boys. The groups constantly insult and discredit each other, even sometimes resulting in brandishing weapons. At one point, N.W.H. brings to light evidence that the Jam Boys' lead rapper attended a prep school, directly threatening his [[credibility|street credibility]].  A [[macabre]] running gag—inspired by ''This is Spinal Tap''—involves their white managers dying under mysterious circumstances (the group originally insist that they "wasn't in town when the shit happened"). They explain to Nina that their first few managers were black—in fact, were their relatives—and that they decided switching to white managers would be better for their families and the black community.  N.W.H.'s internal matters turn sour when Ice Cold cuts down his involvement because he wants to participate in a film, and Cheryl C. ([[Rose Jackson (actress)|Rose Jackson]]), a [[groupie]], hooks up with Tasty-Taste. Although she is clearly more interested in his money than in him, Tasty lets her take over his life. When Tasty finds Cheryl and Ice Cold in bed, N.W.H. is no more.  The group breaks up and each member launches a solo career. Ice dedicates himself to [[house music]]; Tasty brings out a [[wikt:diss song|diss track]] in which he curses Ice; and Tone Def becomes a [[hippie]] (with obvious references to "flower rappers," such as [[P.M. Dawn]]). None sees much success until they ultimately reunite for a triumphant comeback in which their differences have been set aside, at least for the time being.  
Faust (1994 film)
 The story begins on the streets of [[Prague]] on a grey morning busy with commuters. A colourless figure, played by [[Petr Čepek]], emerges from a metro station. On his way home, the man encounters two men handing out flyers. It is a map of the city with a location marked. He shrugs and discards it, returning to his lodging. As he opens the door, a black [[cockerel]] runs out. The man sits down to eat, cutting himself a slice of bread. He discovers an egg concealed inside the loaf. He cracks it open but it is empty. Suddenly the lights go out and the wind rises. Objects are thrown about the room. The commotion ceases; the man goes to the window and looks down to where the two men from earlier are staring up at him. One of them holds the cockerel. The man closes the blind and returns to the table, where he finds the map and, using his own map of the city, traces out the location marked.  The next day, he goes to the spot indicated and enters a dilapidated building just as a man rushes from it in fear. He continues into the interior and descends to a dressing room, where he finds a charred script, a robe embroidered with [[Seal (emblem)|sigils]], greasepaint, a wig with a beard and a cap. Sitting down he addresses himself as [[Faust]] and speaks to himself (the first words spoken in the film) Faust's opening declaration of intent to follow black magic.  As the opening curtain is signalled, 'Faust' finds himself on a stage, a performance about to begin. Ripping off his costume, he breaks through the stage backdrop into a vault where an alchemist's laboratory is revealed; with the aid of a book of spells, he brings to life a clay child which grows horrifyingly into his own image before he smashes it. Warned by a marionette angel not to experiment further but encouraged by a demon to do as he pleases, he is sent by a wooden messenger to a café meeting with the two street-map men, identified as 'Cornelius' and 'Valdes', who give him a briefcase of magical devices. Returning to the vault, he uses these to summon Mephisto, offering Lucifer his soul in return for 24 years of self-indulgence.  At another café, 'Faust' is entertained by Cornelius and Valdes, who provide a fountain of wine from a table-top. He watches as a tramp, carrying a severed human leg, is pestered by a large black dog until he throws the limb into the river. 'Faust' finds a key in his food, uses it on a shop-front shutter, and is dragged back on stage by waiting stagehands. He mimes a scene from Gounod's opera, in which Mephisto returns and the pact with Lucifer is signed in blood. After the interval, 'Faust' visits Portugal to demonstrate his supernatural powers to the King: when a requested restaging of the David and Goliath contest is poorly received, he drowns the entire Portuguese court.  'Faust' is distracted from repentance by Helen of Troy, whom he seduces before realising she is a wooden demon in disguise. Lucifer arrives earlier than expected to claim his soul, and 'Faust' rushes in panic from the theatre, meeting a newcomer in at the doorway as he bursts into the street. He is felled by a red car, and Cornelius and Valdes watch in amusement as a tramp carries away a severed leg from the scene of the accident. A policeman checks the car, but it is without a driver.

Felidae (film)
 Francis, an intelligent and cynical cat, is moved to a gloomy, dilapidated house with his owner Gustav Löbel, an archaeologist and short-story writer/erotic novelist. During Francis' exploratory tour of the house, he smells a chemical odor emanating from the topmost floor. When Francis walks to the back yard, he discovers a cat's corpse. At the crime scene, he meets and befriends Bluebeard, a half-blinded [[Manx cat|Manx]]. Bluebeard tells Francis that this has been the fourth death in the past month. While trying to take a nap in a new home, Francis suffers a nightmare in which a demented figure wearing a laboratory coat puts him in a chained collar.  Soon, Francis discovers another body and the fact that his house's top floor is the meeting site of a sect of cats led by Joker; the members of the sect worship an entity named Claudandus and perform ritualistic suicide by throwing themselves in an [[electric current]]. When Francis' cover is blown after he saw Bluebeard inside the meeting site, he is chased through the city's rooftops. He escapes through a skylight and meets a [[visual impairment|blind]] cat named Felicity, who supplies Francis with information on the Claudandus sect. She reveals that Claudandus was a cat who lived in their area years ago, and was tortured relentlessly by humans. He is hailed as a savior among the local cats, who to this day pray for him. Felicity also reveals herself to be aware of the murders that have occurred. While she never actually witnessed them, she listened to the sounds that were made during the events. She doesn't believe them to be deliberate murders, but believes them to be results of sexual intercourse among cats that have gone too far. Felicity states that so far, the death cries have only come from male cats, and could tell that they were sexually excited shortly before their deaths. She also heard conversations between the then-alive victims and a person they know. She couldn't make out what they were saying, but did sense the urgency in this person's voice, as well as persuasive conviction. She believes that he was trying to tell them something of great importance. The next day, Bluebeard takes Francis to Pascal, an elderly and tech-savvy cat who has taken to meticulously maintaining a list of feline deaths in the area, through which Francis learns that Felicity is the latest victim. As he races back to her to save her, and possibly catch the killer, he comes across her body, her head laying nearby. That night, Francis is haunted by a nightmare in which [[Gregor Mendel]] leaves him with [[riddle]]s.  During a rodent hunt, Francis discovers a video recording that documents the top floor's previous use as an experimental laboratory that was devoted to the research and development of a tissue adhesive that would close wounds in an instant. The test subjects largely consisted of stray cats. However, the serums usually failed, causing the animals to suffer painful deaths. The one cat who survived the experiments was christened by the lab's technicians as "Claudandus", Latin for "He who should or must be sealed". However, Claudandus eventually murdered the project's lead technician, leading to the escape of the other strays and the closure of the lab. Claudandus subsequently became a martyr figure. The murders seem to point to another cat named Kong. However, while escaping Kong and his goons, Francis comes across a murdered female cat named Solitaire, who was pregnant at the time- her unborn kittens spilling out of her opened stomach. Kong reveals she was his mate and is heartbroken over her and his unborn kittens' deaths, leaving the trail cold.  Francis has another dream, though this time, it is not a nightmare. He dreams of meeting a brightly colored cat, who introduces himself as "Felidae". This cat persuades him to join him on a long, wonderful journey. Francis soon wakes up, and immediately hears the calls of a female cat in heat. Upon finding the source of the calls, he discovers her to be a cat whose breed that he doesn't recognize. Upon asking her about her breed, she only gives a cryptic answer, saying that it is "old and new". He then tries asking for her name, but the amorous female cat claims it doesn't matter, and instead insists that they copulate, which he complies without question. Later, Bluebeard finds Francis resting in the bathroom, having been drained from his time with his amorous new acquaintance (which apparently lasted most of the day). When Francis informs Bluebeard about the she-cat he met, and how she looked different from them, Bluebeard reveals to be aware of her breed, and states that they are in many ways different from them. Not only have they been recently been taken in by humans as household pets (to which Bluebeard claims to be a death wish), but for some reason, they lack the same healthy trend to domestication found in most cats. This makes them more feral and more solitary, to which Bluebeard considers makes them "dangerous".   Francis gradually traces the neighborhood cats who descended from the strays involved in the experiments and is confronted by Pascal, who reveals himself as Claudandus. In his pursuits, he saw an opportunity to create a breed of cat that would correspond to the primal ancestor of all domestic cats and be capable of wiping out humanity. The murdered cats, now including Joker, were deemed unworthy of breeding with the pure females that Claudandus had engineered. An additional obstacle in Claudandus' plot is the fact that he is terminally ill with [[stomach cancer]].

Despite his mother-in-law [[Pearl Slaghoople]]'s objections, Fred's wife [[Wilma Flintstone|Wilma]] remains supportive of his decision.  Cliff holds an aptitude test, where the worker with the highest mark will become the new vice president of the company. Barney gets the highest score but he switches his paper with Fred, who he knows will fail. Fred receives the promotion, but his first order is to dismiss Barney, since Barney now effectively has the lowest score. Fred doesn't want to fire him, but Vandercave tells Fred if he doesn't fire him, he will fire Barney for him and Fred will be fired too. Fred reluctantly accepts, but does his best to help Barney support his family, even inviting the Rubbles to live with them so that they can rent out their home. However, Fred's job and newfound wealth put a strain on his relationships with Wilma and the Rubbles. Cliff eventually tricks Fred into dismissing the workers, over the objections of his office Dictabird. Later, Barney confronts Fred after seeing worker riots on the news revealing that he switched tests with Fred and the Rubbles move out, despite having nowhere to live. Wilma and Pebbles also move out to her mother's house, leaving Fred behind.  Fred goes to the quarry and realizes his mistake and Cliff's plan, but also finds out that Cliff has manipulated events to make it look as if Fred stole the money, and has reported it to the police. A manhunt for Fred ensues by the police and the workers. Wilma and Betty see this on the news, and break into Slate and Co. to get the Dictabird, the only witness who can clear Fred's name, unaware that Cliff saw them from his office window. As Fred attempts to enter a cave where the workers are seeking refuge, they see through his disguise and attempt to hang him. Barney is almost hanged as well after he admits his part. Fred and Barney reconcile, but before they can be hanged, Wilma and Betty arrive with the Dictabird, who tells them the true story.

Fred and Barney confront Cliff at the quarry, where Cliff has tied Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm to a huge machine. Though they hand him the Dictabird, Cliff activates the machine to stall them. Barney rescues the children while Fred destroys the machine. The Dictabird escapes from Cliff and lures him back to the quarry, where Miss Stone knocks him out, having had a change of heart after learning that Cliff was planning to betray her. The police, Wilma, Betty, and Mr. Slate arrive and Cliff attempts to flee, but he is petrified by a substance falling from the machine.  With the Dictabird's help, all charges against Fred are dropped, while Miss Stone is arrested as Cliff's accomplice, though Fred is confident she will be granted leniency for helping them stop Cliff. Impressed with the substance that Fred inadvertently created by destroying the machine, Mr. Slate dubs the substance "[[concrete]]" in honor of his daughter Concretia and makes plans to produce it with Fred as the president of its division, thus ending the Stone Age. Having realized the negatives of his wealth and status as the new CEO, Fred declines and asks that the workers be rehired and given the job benefits he initially set out to achieve, which is granted. As the Flintstones and Rubbles have finally made amends, Fred and Barney get into a humorous quarrel when Fred once again asks Barney for a small amount of money for breakfast.  
Fist of Legend
 [[Chen Zhen (character)|Chen Zhen]] ([[Jet Li]]) attends class in [[Kyoto University]] when some Japanese students from the Black Dragon Clan burst in and attempt to force him out because he is [[Chinese people|Chinese]]. Mitsuko Yamada ([[Shinobu Nakayama]]), one of Chen Zhen's female classmates who is in a romantic relationship with him, along with Chen's professor and classmates, defend his presence. The thugs turn violent but Chen easily defeats them using a variety of controlled [[Chin Na]] techniques. The Japanese thugs' [[sensei]], Funakochi Fumio ([[Yasuaki Kurata]]), who is also Mitsuko's uncle, arrives to take control of the situation and apologizes for his students' behavior. Fumio is impressed by Chen's skill and converses with him, and Chen learns that his [[sifu|master]] [[Huo Yuanjia]] has died after losing in a match against a Japanese Fighter. Chen is distraught after hearing the bad news and he leaves [[Kyoto]] for [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]] immediately.  Chen returns to [[Chin Woo Athletic Association|Jingwu School]] and learns that — his master's son Huo Ting'en ([[Chin Siu-ho]]) — has become the new master of the Jingwu. The next day, Chen goes to the Japanese [[dojo]] to challenge Ryoichi Akutagawa (Jackson Liu), the Japanese fighter who allegedly defeated Huo Yuanjia. Akutagawa honorably accepts Chen's challenge. Chen defeats Akutagawa easily and concludes that Akutagawa is not capable of defeating his master, after which he suspects [[crime|foul play]] in Huo Yuanjia's death. Chen has Huo's corpse exhumed for an autopsy against the wishes of Huo Ting'en and Jingwu's members. It is revealed that Huo Yuanjia was poisoned and weakened before his match against Akutagawa. Over the next few days, word of Chen's victory against Akutagawa spreads and Chen becomes a local celebrity in Shanghai. Jingwu's students begin to look up to Chen as their new instructor, which incurs the jealousy of Huo Ting'en. Huo remains silent and seeks comfort in a [[brothel]], where he becomes romantically involved with a prostitute Rose ([[Ada Choi]]).  Meanwhile, Akutagawa confronts General Gō Fujita ([[Billy Chow]]) of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] that his match result with Huo Yuanjia was pre-meditated by Fujita, which he considers dishonorable. After a heated argument, Fujita kills Akutagawa by breaking his back brutally in front of the Japanese ambassador (Toshimichi Takahashi), but places the blame for this on Chen Zhen. Enraged by their master's death, Akutagawa's students attack the Jingwu School, culminating in a fight that is eventually stopped by the local police. Chen is arrested and placed on trial for allegedly murdering Akutagawa. Several "witnesses" provide false and conflicting accounts of the murder, but the court refuses to accept testimony from any Chinese defense witnesses on the grounds of "bias" towards Chen. Mitsuko testifies that Chen is innocent because he spent the night with her, and the court accepts her false testimony because she is a Japanese. Chen is exonerated, but his apparent relationship with Mitsuko ruins his reputation, as the Chinese view it as an act of treachery against the Chinese empire. Huo Ting'en and the senior Jingwu members demand that Chen either leave Mitsuko or leave the school, and Huo uses the opportunity to settle his personal vendetta against Chen by challenging him to a fight. Chen defeats Huo eventually with much reluctance but chooses to leave with Mitsuko. Huo Ting'en is humiliated by his defeat and gives up his position as headmaster of Jingwu before leaving to join his lover. Jingwu's members eventually discover Huo's relationship with her and reprimand him. Huo learns his lesson and returns to Jingwu.  Chen and Mitsuko faces hostility from the locals and are forced to lay in an abandoned hut near Huo Yuanjia's grave. At the same time, Fumio arrives from Japan as requested by Fujita, to eliminate Chen. Fumio engages Chen in a [[blindfold]]ed fight, which ends in a draw, acknowledging that if Chen can learn to adapt to his opponent, he will be unbeatable. Fumio leaves after warning Chen about General Fujita's ill intentions and brutal methods. Days later, Huo Ting'en visits Chen and apologizes for his earlier behavior, saying that Jingwu School accepts Chen and Mitsuko's relationship now. Huo teaches Chen the [[Mizongyi|Mizong Fist]] that night while Mitsuko leaves secretly, leaving behind a message for Chen that she will wait for him in Japan.  The next day, Chen and Huo Ting'en confront Fujita at his dojo, where Fujita exposes a traitor from Jingwu, who played a role in Huo Yuanjia's death, and shoots him in order to atone for planning Huo's death. Huo Ting'en then fights Fujita, who appears to be incredibly strong and resilient, and Huo suffers grave injuries. Chen engages Fujita himself in a long and exhausting fight, and eventually defeats him. Just as Chen and Huo are about to leave, the enraged Fujita comes after them with a [[katana]], and Chen is forced to kill Fujita.  Armed Japanese soldiers then surround them and prepare to open fire. The Japanese ambassador (who is a [[pacifist]] against [[Japanese militarism]]) arrives and orders his soldiers to stand down. He agrees with Chen's actions as he has been aware that Fujita is a madman, but also warns them that the Japanese government will use Fujita's death as an excuse to start a war with China, unless the Chinese can account for Fujita's death by executing the murderer. Chen expresses his willingness to accept the blame for Fujita's death in order to prevent war, earning the ambassador's further admiration.  Instead of ordering Chen's death, the ambassador stages a fake execution and substitutes the dead Jingwu's traitor's body for Chen's, while Chen leaves Shanghai secretly to join Mitsuko in Japan once more.

At the reception, Charles finds himself seated with several ex-girlfriends who relate embarrassing stories about his inability to be discreet and afterwards bumps into Henrietta, known among Charles' friends as "Duckface", with whom he had a particularly difficult relationship.

Fresh tries to convince Chuckie to take Roscoe out of the fight, but nevertheless, their dog wins. Chuckie wants to enter him into another fight but Fresh stops him, agreeing to get him a job with Esteban. They go to Esteban's apartment where they accidentally walk in on Esteban and Nichole finishing having sex. Esteban tells them to wait in another room, where Chuckie asks for a job. Esteban dismisses Chuckie after Chuckie boasts of "busting those dope moves" and tells Fresh that he plans to groom Fresh to his protege and wants Fresh to stop selling for other dealers.  Meanwhile, Corky has the police's attention since Jake's shooting attracted attention. Fresh takes his own savings to a cocaine source, Hector, under the pretense of being the runner for Corky. Hector refuses to hand over the drugs to Fresh, fearing that the police will come after him. Fresh threatens him and offers him a big sum of cash, which we understand to be the entirety of Fresh's personal savings. Hector takes the cash and tells Fresh where to pick up the drugs. Fresh says that the police have wire-tapped Corky's phone numbers and tells Hector not to call Corky.  At school, Chuckie can't resist bragging about his supposed new job for Esteban. After school, he and Fresh buy science textbooks to hide the drugs. Fresh and Chuckie begin to get into a verbal altercation throughout the trip when Chuckie almost gets arrested on the train for talking back to an officer, which Fresh had to intervene and deescalate the situation. As Fresh is bickering with Chuckie, they go to an abandoned house where Fresh hides their stash in the floorboards while Chuckie keeps lookout. When leaving the building, three men step out from behind the corner, approaching them and armed. Fresh begins to run but goes back to Chuckie, who has now drawn his gun at the assailants. Chuckie tries to shoot at the men and run, but trips. The gun falls under a car and Chuckie tries to grab it but an assailant shoots the tire and it flattens under Chuckie's hand, crushing it. Fresh runs back over to help him, but Chuckie is stuck. Another assailant fires a shot at the car, prompting Fresh to run away and abandon Chuckie. The assailants walk over to Chuckie and kill him. Fresh is questioned by the police at the police station, realizing that Fresh has been at the scene of now two deaths. However, since they have no evidence to detain him, they let him go.  Back at home, Fresh's aunt remonstrates sadly with him for getting involved in gunfire and tells him that she cannot risk the lives of her eleven other children for him. She informs him that he will be sent to a group home for a month. At school, Fresh's friends blame him for Chuckie's death and truly alone, Fresh shoots Chuckie's dog, Roscoe. When Fresh goes outside, Jake forces him in the car with the three assailants (revealing that Jake was behind the ambush on Fresh and Chuckie). They bring Fresh to a room where Corky is waiting.  Corky is upset that Chuckie's bragging about moving base for Esteban (the same drugs that Corky is selling) got back to him and that Esteban is encroaching on his product. The drugs that Jake and the assailants took off of Chuckie reveal that both Fresh and Chuckie were carrying crack cocaine. Corky grabs big chain links and threatens to beat Fresh to death to send a message to rival dealers. However, Fresh lies to the other henchmen that Fresh was being forced to sell for Jake. An astonished Jake pulls out his guns and walks over to shoot Fresh, but Corky's henchmen turn on Jake and Jake's friend Red. Both Jake and Red try to convince everyone that Fresh is lying. However, Fresh insists that Jake and Red were planning to oust Corky and he was only saying that he was selling for Esteban as protection. Fresh tells them to call Hector, who will reveal the truth. Corky calls Hector, where Hector confirms that he met with Fresh. The conversation is short, with Hector expressing concern over Corky' phone being wire-tapped, as Hector was told was the case, by Fresh. Corky then whips Red and Jake to death. Corky turns to Fresh and asks who else is involved. Fresh names James.  Fresh then goes to Esteban's warehouse and tells him that Corky's crew had jumped him and says that Corky is planning to sell heroin as well. He tells Esteban that Corky's distributor is James and the two are planning to meet that night. He also adds that Nichole is seeing James secretly because James is plotting with Corky to take Esteban out. Corky and his men arrive at James' place and storm in while Esteban, Fresh, and two other men wait in Esteban's car, watching them. Esteban signals his henchmen to follow him and tells Fresh and Herbie to stay put.  Inside, Esteban's crew kills James, Corky, and Corky's men. Afterwards, they drive to Esteban's place and Esteban sees Nichole is there. He tells his henchmen to take Fresh home but Fresh makes them stop the car, claiming that he will spend the night at a friend's house. He runs into a convenience store and makes a phone call on a pay phone.  He then shows up at Esteban's apartment, claiming that he couldn't go home. Esteban lets him stay because he wants to confront Fresh for telling Nichole that he found her father in Staten Island and for urging her to leave for a rehabilitation center. Angry, Esteban demands to know what else Fresh is hiding from him. The three argue and Esteban tries to force Nichole to stay with him.  The police arrive and as Esteban goes to answer the door, Fresh hides something under the bed. The police officer turns out to be Sgt. Perez, who reveals that he is responding to a call about a domestic dispute. Esteban denies any argument and suggests they have the wrong apartment. Fresh comes forward and tells Perez that his sister is scared to speak up and how Esteban is a drug dealer who killed James and is now threatening his sister. Esteban swears that he is clean but Fresh tells Sgt. Perez to check under the bed. The policeman looks under the bed and find Esteban's gun (which he removed from the car after the shooting earlier) and the drugs Fresh planted. The police take Esteban away and Sgt. Perez promises to [[witness protection|protect]] Fresh and his sister from any retaliation. Fresh expresses that he no longer wants to live in any "projects". The movie ends with Fresh playing chess with his father, where he cries.  
French Silk (film)
 The film opens with a report announcing the murder in New Orleans of Reverend Jackson Bird, a controversial evangelist preacher who used his powerful position on television to spread the word of God. Detective Cassidy (Horsley) is assigned to the case, and is led to his prime suspect: Claire Laurent (Lucci), the owner of a lingerie company called ''French Silk''. Claire would have a strong motive for killing Reverend Bird, considering that he wanted to close down her company for thinking it was too obscene. Even though Claire denies ever having met the man, the media think of her as the murderer, leading to much negative publicity. Cassidy, who is known for being tough, falls for Claire after the first meeting. Following the announce of his death, Claire's model friend Martine (Belafonte) immediately flies over from New York to support her. Claire is unaware that Martine had multiple reasons for coming over to New Orleans, including to resume an affair with married Congressman Alister Petrie (Metzler).  Quickly, Cassidy finds out that Claire has made several lies to him about her background and about never having met Jackson, as well as finding information on the reverend in her dumpster. Worried, Claire calls her friend Andre (Warfield), who assures her that he has not told anything to the police. She continues to be battered by Cassidy on her background, and admits that she was born out of wedlock when her mother was only 16 years old. Cassidy then displays the audio tape of her phone call with Andre, but Claire connects the phone call yet again with her mother. She insists that she was taking a walk in the city around the time that Jackson was murdered, and reenacts the walk with Cassidy to prove it. Around this time, Cassidy proclaims his attraction towards her, and explains that he has made a serious mistake in his career past before, and cannot afford to be wrong again. They kiss afterwards.  Despite collecting more evidence on the murder proving Claire's guilt, by searching the French Silk's office, Cassidy falls more for her charm. When she notices that he is coming closer to arresting her, she attempts to send him away, though he persists to stay, leading for them to become intimate. As they are about to have sex, Claire grows convinced that he is only seducing her to lure her into a confession, and sends him away. Meanwhile, Martine tries to pressure Alister in leaving his wife for her, and when he announces that he wants to wait until after the election – which is in three months – she becomes enraged, and threatens to ruin his career. The next day, while Martine admits her affair with Alister to Claire, Cassidy is nearly fired by Chief Crowder (Ermey) for his assumption that he has been withholding information to the police due to his personal involvement with the suspect.   The same night, Martine, after also finding out that her career as a model is over, rushes to Alister's place with intentions of shooting him. When his teenage daughter Amy (Teague) opens the door, Martine becomes devastated and instead kills herself. Afterwards, it is revealed that the gun that she used to kill herself was the same that killed Jackson. Alister, however, tries to prove Martine's innocence by claiming that Martine was with him when Jackson was killed. He insists that, while it was in fact Martine's gun, it was taken on the night of Jackson's murder by someone who had direct access to her belongings. Cassidy rushes to the Laurent residence to confront Claire and her mother (Marshall) with the new proceedings, causing Claire to give an immediate confession of the murder. While Cassidy reluctantly takes her in, she is almost shot by a follower of Jackson, but Cassidy saves her life. Due to a riot, Cassidy has to change roads, and they stop at a family house of Claire. There, she admits that Jackson was not as holy as everyone thinks he was, and impregnated her mother when she was just a young convent girl. After explaining her motive, Claire kisses Cassidy, and they spend the night together intimately.   The next morning, as Claire is taken to jail, Andre comes forward to reveal that Claire is covering for her mother, whom she thinks killed Jackson. Claire eventually admits that she was trying to protect her mother, but it is revealed through Andre that Jackson has been blackmailing Alister for his several affairs. Claire mistakenly thought that her mother killed Jackson, and Alister was actually responsible for the murder, because he was fed up with being blackmailed. While Alister is arrested for murder, Claire is cleared from all charges and resumes her passionate relationship with Cassidy.

The job is successful, but it turns out the [[drug lord]] wanted his nephew free to kill him.  Rudy is waiting with a getaway plane, but he sees police cars and leaves Doc behind. After a year in a Mexican jail, Doc sends Carol to [[mob boss]] Jack Benyon, who is looking to put together a select team of experts to rob a [[Greyhound racing|dog track]] in [[Arizona]]. Benyon agrees to get Doc released from prison, in exchange for sexual favors from Carol first.  Doc gets out and meets the men Benyon has hired. One is Rudy, along with Hansen, who seems inexperienced. Rudy extends a hand and says "No hard feelings" but is punched by Doc and warned not to double-cross him again.  At the track, while Doc is breaking into the vault, a guard pulls a gun and is shot by Hansen in a panic. The thieves escape by creating a diversion with a bomb under a gas truck and leave with the cash. The plan was for Doc and Carol to meet Rudy and Hansen later to split the money.

God of Gamblers Returns
  Five years have passed since the events of the first [[God of Gamblers]] film.  Ko Chun ([[Chow Yun-fat]]) is now living a peaceful retirement on his French estate with his pregnant wife Wan Yau ([[Sharla Cheung]]), while his disciples Knife and Sing (from the [[All For The Winner]] series) have become world-renowned in their own right. Chun declines repeated challenges from other top-ranked gamblers, having given up gambling in favor of the quiet life.  Chun's friend and former bodyguard, Dragon ([[Charles Heung]]), the "God Of Guns", comes to pay him a visit.   While the two are away from the house for a friendly shooting competition, Chau Siu-Chee ([[Wu Hsing-kuo]]), a Taiwanese gambler and the world's number one contender to Ko Chun's title, arrives and murders his wife and unborn son in order to goad Chun into a gambling match.  After a shootout with Chau Siu-Chee's henchmen, Ko Chun arrives to discover his wife dying.  With her last breath, she asks Chun to promise that he will not gamble or admit his real identity for one year, in the hopes that he will not lose his life in an impulsive act of revenge.  Chun agrees as she dies in his arms.  Nevertheless, he proclaims that he will avenge her after his promise is fulfilled.  Chun travels the world for eleven months anonymously.  In the twelfth month, he arrives in mainland [[China]] and gets into a series of comic misadventures with a small-time hustler named Little Trumpet ([[Tony Leung Ka-fai]]), a police captain ([[Elvis Tsui]]), and Hoi Tong, a crime boss's daughter ([[Chingmy Yau]]).  Hoi Tong also has a score to settle with Chau Siu-Chee after he sent assassins to murder her father.  Chun also becomes close with Little Trumpet's sister Yiu Yiu ([[Jacklyn Wu]]), who idolizes the God of Gamblers (but is unaware of Chun's true identity).   With three days before his promise ends, Ko Chun and his group arrive in [[Taiwan]] to confront Chau Siu-Chee.  Still bound to his word to keep his identity secret, Chun proclaims that he is Little Knife, the disciple of the God of Gamblers, and that his master will arrive in three days for a match with Chau to determine the true champion.  The group retires to Hoi Tong's family compound to plan for the upcoming match.  Later, Chau Siu-Chee meets with Cheung Po-Sing, reputed to be the only person to have ever beaten Ko Chun in a poker match (by physically changing Chun's [[hole card]] using [[supernatural]] powers).  Chau is initially skeptical but after a demonstration of Cheung's powers Chau is convinced and enlists his help.  Chan Kam-Sing, Ko Chun's opponent from the first film, arrives at Hoi Tong's home to warn Chun that Chau Siu-Chee is [[insane]], so obsessed with gambling that he made Chan bet his hands in a match and subsequently had them amputated when he lost.  Chau Siu-Chee's men then storm the compound to kill Ko Chun and the group, but Dragon arrives to save them.  In the ensuing firefight, Chan and Yiu Yiu are killed, with Chun promising to avenge them.  With his promise fulfilled, Ko Chun, Dragon, and the rest of the group head to Chau Siu-Chee's casino for the final showdown.  As the [[five card stud]] game proceeds, Ko Chun gains an early advantage, but ends up losing several rounds due to Cheung Po-Sing's interference.  In desperation, he puts up his entire wealth and holdings and his [[eyes]] for one final deciding round.   Chau agrees to match the bet and shows his [[straight flush]], gloating that he has Ko Chun beaten, but Chun reveals his hand - a higher-ranked straight flush, indicating that he has won the game.  Chun reveals that "[[Zhang Baosheng|Cheung Po-Sing]]" is a [[magician (fantasy)|magician]] and a good friend of his, that all the instances of card changing were simply [[sleight of hand]] tricks, and that the rumors that Cheung had beaten the God of Gamblers were started by none other than Ko Chun himself, a year ago.  Ko Chun then demands that Chau make payment in full, including his eyes. Enraged, Chau removes a concealed pistol and attempts to kill Ko Chun, but is in turn killed by Chun, finally avenging his wife, Yiu Yiu, and all the other people Chau had hurt.  As the crowd cheers and applauds, Ko Chun and Dragon prepare to depart.  Ko Chun notices Dragon is crying and remarks that he didn't think Dragon was capable of shedding tears.  Dragon quips, "I was really afraid that you were going to lose all of my money."  Ko Chun waves to the crowd one last time as the film ends.  
The Glass Shield
 John "J. J." Johnson is a rookie deputy sheriff in the [[Los Angeles Sheriff's Department]].  Because of his inexperience and race, he  experiences tension with his white colleagues as their first black deputy.  Although he initially clashes with Deputy Deborah Fields, the department's first female deputy, they strike up a friendship.  While on patrol, Johnson backs up Deputy Bono when he stops a black man, Teddy Woods, at a gas station.  When Bono runs Woods' drivers license, he finds a warrant for his arrest.  Woods reveals he has a stolen pistol in his car, and the police officers arrest him.  Deputy Fields is the second deputy to the scene of a murder, but Detectives Baker and Hall dismiss her observations.  Mr. Greenspan says a black man murdered his wife in a botched robbery, and the detectives pressure Woods to confess after they trace his stolen pistol to the murder.  Woods defiantly proclaims his innocence, frustrating his lawyer, James Locket, who advises him to show less attitude in court.  At the same time, community activist Reverend Banks raises awareness of the death of a black prisoner whom he believes to have been murdered by the police while in custody.  Johnson dismisses the concerns of his family and girlfriend, saying there is no evidence of this.  While coaching Bono on what to say at the trial, Johnson's commander, Clarence Massey, learns that Bono stopped Woods because of his race.  Frustrated, Massey instructs him to come up with a better excuse.  Bono suggests a traffic violation and later requests that Johnson back him up.  Johnson agrees, and Massey praises him for his loyalty and dependability while chastising Fields for her refusal to fit in better.  At the trial, Locket points out holes in the police testimony, making Johnson wonder if he made the right decision.  Fields joins Johnson in investigating what really happened.  With help from a whistleblower, they discover numerous cover-ups that involve Baker, Hall, and Massey.  As the trial progresses and Greenspan's testimony proves problematic, Massey has Baker murder Greenspan to prevent him from becoming a liability.  Hall, sick from cancer, dies at the station.  Tensions rise as Johnson and Fields continue pursuing their own investigation, and they become further paranoid when Johnson insists they were intentionally given faulty intelligence during a drug raid.  After Fields is hospitalized following an assault, Johnson and Baker come to blows.  Massey breaks them up and temporarily places Johnson in a jail cell.  When released, he delivers incriminating evidence to Locket that implicates Baker in various crimes, including the murder of the black prisoner and framing Woods.  The jury can not reach a verdict.  Facing a widespread investigation of police corruption that goes to the city council and mayor's office, the district attorney offers to drop the charges against Woods.  Locket, with the reluctant backing of a city councilman, instead pushes for a new trial, which the judge accepts.  Bono turns state's evidence and testifies against Johnson, admitting that the two committed perjury.  Caught up in the probe, Johnson pleads guilty and receives a suspended sentence.  After the sheriff's department is disbanded, Massey retires, Baker is sentenced to four years and is in an honor prison while appealing. The unit is disbanded and the other officers including Bono are reassigned.

Meanwhile, members of the United Nations Godzilla Countermeasures Center arrive at Birth Island in order to plant a mind control device on Godzilla. The Cosmos, Mothra's twin priestesses, appear to psychic [[Miki Saegusa]] and warn her of SpaceGodzilla's arrival. M.O.G.U.E.R.A. (Mobile Operations G-Force Universal Expert Robot: Aero-type), a [[mecha]] built by the [[JSDF]] to replace [[Mechagodzilla]], is sent in to intercept SpaceGodzilla, but suffers damage in the process.  SpaceGodzilla lands on Birth Island and attacks Godzilla's offspring, [[Godzilla Junior|Little Godzilla]]. Godzilla intervenes but finds itself overwhelmed by SpaceGodzilla, and is powerless to stop its clone from trapping Little Godzilla in a crystal prison. SpaceGodzilla leaves for Japan with Godzilla in pursuit.  Shortly thereafter, the [[Yakuza]] abduct Miki and bring her back to their base in [[Fukuoka]] in an attempt to use her psychic abilities to gain control over Godzilla. Miki is saved by a rescue team before SpaceGodzilla arrives. SpaceGodzilla lands in central Fukuoka and forms a massive fortress of celestial crystals. M.O.G.U.E.R.A. arrives to once again fight SpaceGodzilla, but is still no match for it. Godzilla arrives in [[Kagoshima Bay]] and fights SpaceGodzilla, but SpaceGodzilla easily gains the upper hand.  The JSDF discovers that SpaceGodzilla is using [[Fukuoka Tower]] as a power converter, using it to transform the Earth's core into an energy that SpaceGodzilla can absorb, slowly killing the planet. While Godzilla wrestles with SpaceGodzilla, M.O.G.E.R.A. splits into two different mechas: the Star Falcon, a flying battleship, and the Land M.O.G.U.E.R.A., a tank with a large drill in front of it. The mechas damage the crystal fortress while Godzilla pushes over Fukuoka Tower, cutting off SpaceGodzilla's energy supply.

Greedy (film)
 Carl, Ed, Frank, Glen, and Patti McTeague are the greedy relatives of wealthy, wheelchair-bound scrap-metal tycoon Uncle Joe McTeague. They continually suck up to him and try to outdo each other in order to inherit his millions when he passes away. With their attempts constantly failing and irritable Uncle Joe showing a decided interest in his new sexy "nurse" Molly, Frank decides to hire a private detective named Laura to bring in his brother Daniel (who turned his back on the family years ago because of their selfishness) believing if they can make up, Uncle Joe will thaw towards them.  Instead of finding Daniel, Laura finds his son Danny of whom Uncle Joe had always been especially fond. A professional bowler, Danny left the family with his father, but he accepts the cousins' invitation to return — after rolling a gutter ball in a big tournament and finding out that he has a pre-arthritic condition developing in his wrist.  Danny's television sports producer girlfriend Robin encourages him to ask Uncle Joe for a loan to invest in a bowling alley. A typically rude and crude Joe says he will lend the money only if Danny sides with him against his own father. Danny is offended and leaves with his girlfriend, much to the annoyance of the other relatives. They confront Molly later on and she realizes just how conniving and desperate they are for Uncle Joe's money.  Uncle Joe asks Danny to visit him at his scrapyard, to apologize for trying to bribe him, but the old man calls a number to place a shipping order to a company he finds out has been closed for 25 years. Realizing that his relatives could declare him incompetent and throw him in a retirement home, he tells Danny that he plans to hand his fortune over to Molly. Danny realizes how much he'd like to inherit his fortune and tells him not to rush into anything.  Danny moves in with Uncle Joe and starts competing for his money, even so far as to sing a [[Jimmy Durante]] song that Joe loved him to perform as a little kid. But Molly has other ideas and decides to use her "assets" to outdo Danny and have sex with the elderly gentleman, if only to keep the relatives from getting his money. But after her successful attempt to get Joe in the bedroom, they are interrupted by Danny's father Daniel and he and Danny engage in an heated argument, in which Danny chooses Uncle Joe over him. Molly feels disgusted with herself for almost having sex with Joe and tells Danny she has to leave, but not before Danny promises to look after Joe. However, Danny tells Robin that he'd actually hired an actor to play his "so-called" father, to win favor with his Uncle, and she feels he's become too greedy and leaves him.  At Joe's attorney's office, Danny is ready to inherit Joe's fortune when his relatives arrive with his real father. Danny admits that he's become as bad as the rest of the family. But it soon becomes apparent that Uncle Joe is not only bankrupt, he is in debt. After a big scene that involves Frank fighting Danny, the relatives leave and Joe tells Danny that he was simply "playing them" to find out who actually loved him. Danny tells him "nobody loves you," and leaves to make up with Robin. When Danny asks Douglas where Uncle Joe is, Douglas says that he doesn't know.  With ill health, no money and no place to go, Danny and Robin decide to let Joe stay with them in their apartment. But Joe gives them another surprise, and reveals that he still has a fortune as he has them look outside to see Molly and Douglas. He offers the two of them to stay with him, saying "Whatever I own, you own". Danny accepts but on the condition that all of the lies and the games stop. Uncle Joe calmly gets up out of his wheelchair and exits their apartment whilst Danny and Robin watch.

Gopi Kishan
  Kishan, is a hardened criminal who returns home after completing 14 years imprisonment for murder. Kishan had killed a man in his childhood, when the latter tried to molest his mother. Kishan thinks his father is dead, but he soon learns that his mother has kept the truth under wraps. He learns that his father Suraj Malhotra was a jeweller who killed his partner and ran away with some precious jewels. She tells Kishan that she never saw Suraj after that, and now he is a dreaded gangster in the underworld.  Kishan decides to avenge his father for all his wrongdoings. He singles out Sawant, a powerful man of Suraj and decides to strike on him. Meanwhile, Gopi, a doppelgänger of Kishan, works as a constable in the police force. Gopi has a doting mother, a wife and a kid, but isn't taken seriously as he lacks the guts to become anything worthwhile. Kishan spots Gopi and decides to use him for his purposes. Kishan starts bumping off the goons, while Gopi starts getting the credit.  Soon, Gopi's fortune changes, while Kishan succeeds in furthering his motives. Sadly, Seema, the Commissioner's daughter, falls in love with Gopi, unaware of his marital status. One day, Kishan manages to sneak into Malhotra's lair. He holds Malhotra at gunpoint and shows him the photo of his mother. He learns that Sawant is the kingpin and Suraj the pawn, rather than other way around. Suraj tells Kishan that Sawant's men killed Suraj's partner for the jewels. Suraj somehow scooted off with the money and hid it in the basement of a construction site.  Sawant caught Suraj and told him that the latter has been convicted for the former's crimes. Sawant also tells him that his wife has committed suicide and his son would be killed too, if Suraj does not tell the location of the jewels. Suraj does not tell the location, but to save the infant from death, takes the blame on himself. Upon this, Kishan reveals his true identity. Both realize that Sawant passed some other child as Suraj's child. Kishan learns that the place the money was hidden is the police headquarters.  Kishan decides to retrieve the loot, but both Gopi and Seema realize the truth. Now, Gopi starts hunting for Kishan. Meanwhile, Kishan has infuriated Sawant too by killing some of his goons.

But Gopi is in for a surprise when Kishan's mother and Gopi's mother turn out to be acquaintances.  Gopi's mother reveals that when Kishan's mother was in labour, she delivered twins. Gopi's mother was actually childless, so she took one of the kids. Gopi is in a quandary as he cannot arrest his newfound brother, but decides that he has to do this, one way or other. Meanwhile, Kishan has revealed the truth to Seema, who agrees to help him in retrieving the score. Sawant succeeds in nabbing Kishan. Unable to see his son tortured, Suraj spills the beans.  Now, Gopi enters the den and pretends to be Kishan, claiming that Sawant has actually kidnapped the gullible Gopi. One by one, all the villains are unmasked. Suraj is delighted to meet his wife, while both Gopi and Kishan start bringing Sawant's empire to dust. After killing Sawant's son, which provides poetic justice in this case, all the goons are rounded off. Suraj is finally united with his extended family in the end.  
Govinda Govinda
 Somewhere in time between [[Treta Yuga]] and [[Kali Yuga]], sage [[Bhrigu]] ([[Gummadi Venkateswara Rao|Gummadi]]) after performing Lok Kalyana Yaga visits [[Vaikuntha]], and [[Lord Vishnu]] ([[Arun Govil]]) was reposing on [[Adisesha]] with Sri [[Mahalakshmi]] in service at his feet. Finding that Lord Vishnu did not notice him, the sage was infuriated and kicked the Lord on His chest, the place where [[Mahalakshmi]] ([[Yamuna (actress)|Yamuna]]) resides. Vishnu, in an attempt to pacify the sage, got hold of the legs of the sage and started to press them gently in a way that was comforting to the sage. During this act, he squeezed the extra eye that was present in the sole of Bhrigu's foot. The extra eye is believed to represent the sage's egotism. The sage then realized his grave mistake and apologized to Vishnu. Thereupon, the sage concluded that Lord Vishnu was supreme of the [[Trimurti]] and told the rishis the same. Sri [[Mahalakshmi]] was angered by the action of Her Lord in apologizing to Bhrigu who committed an offense. Out of anger and anguish, She left [[Vaikuntha]]. After the departure of [[Mahalakshmi]], a forlorn Lord Vishnu left [[Vaikunta]], came down to Earth, and took abode in an ant-hill under a tamarind tree, beside a Pushkarini on the [[Venkata (hill)|Venkata hill]], meditating for the return of Lakshmi, without food or sleep. Disturbed with this phenomenon, [[angels]], and [[Devata|Devta]]s, appeal to Lord Vishnu to bring back goddess Lakshmi to help sustain the Universe, hence In [[Kali Yuga]], Lord Vishnu takes the form of [[Venkateswara]] and incarnates on the Earth.  In present-day [[Bangkok]], a [[Tantra|Tantric]] Stavroj (Dhir) believes that by donating a virgin woman's head to Lord [[Venkateswara]]'s crown, he aims to attain supernatural powers through [[Telekinesis]], which would bring down the universe to his feet. The Tantric [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] plans for execution of the theft of the Deity's Crown at the [[Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala]], India for one million dollars in association with [[Bombay]]'s notorious underworld mafia don Paresh, ([[Paresh Rawal]]), an experienced burglar known for [[grave robbery]], and smuggling rare metals on the [[black market]].

In India, on her vacation to [[Tirumala]], she gets in touch with a [[Taxi]] driver ([[Akkineni Nagarjuna]]), and establishes a relationship with him. How the couple gets entangled in the underworld criminal nexus, while rescuing the robbery, forms the crux of the plot.  
Guarding Tess
 Doug Chesnic is a Secret Service agent who takes great pride in his job, performing his duties with the utmost professionalism. His assignment for the last three years has been a severe test of his patience. Doug is in charge of a team stationed in [[Ohio]] to protect Tess Carlisle, the widow of a former U.S. President.  Tess is well known for her diplomatic and philanthropic work, but seems to regard Doug less as a security officer and more as a domestic servant—not unlike her chauffeur, Earl, or her nurse, Frederick.  Doug regards it as beneath his professional dignity to perform little chores around the house or bring Tess her breakfast in bed. Tess orders him to do so, even to fetch her ball during a round of golf. Any time Doug defies her, Tess contacts a close friend - the current President of the United States – to express her displeasure. The annoyed President then phones Doug.  Doug's three-year hitch with Tess comes to an end, so he is eager to be given a more exciting and challenging assignment. But Tess has decided that she  wants him to stay, and, as usual, she gets her way.  Their bickering continues, even in the car. Alone there with Earl for a minute, Tess orders him to drive off, stranding her bodyguards. A humiliated Doug must phone the local sheriff—not for the first time—to be on the lookout for her. He fires Earl when they return, but Tess manages to countermand that decision as well.  After she returns from a hospital checkup, Tess watches old television footage of her husband's funeral, concentrating on a momentary glimpse of Doug among the mourners, overcome with grief. It is an indication that perhaps she keeps Doug around because she values his loyalty to her husband and his company. She makes an effort to get on his good side, sharing a drink and a late-night conversation. Morale for the agents improved when Tess tells them that the President would be visiting her late husband's presidential library, but his subsequent cancellation lowered her spirits.  Doug finally does get the professional excitement he craved, but in a way he could not foresee. Tess is kidnapped. While the FBI takes charge of the investigation, Doug and his security detail are not only anxious and guilt-ridden, but are informed that Mrs. Carlisle's recent dizzy spells are actually being caused by an inoperable brain tumor.  As the investigation begins without him, Doug finds evidence of Earl being involved. In Earl's hospital room, where the chauffeur was taken after claiming to be rendered unconscious by the abductors, Doug threatens to shoot off Earl's toes, one by one, until he confesses to an FBI agent where Mrs. Carlisle is being held. Doug goes so far as to shoot one toe.<ref>[http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/g/guarding-tess-script-transcript-cage.html Guarding Tess Script] Scriporama</ref> Earl admits that Mrs. Carlisle is being held captive by Earl's sister and her husband.  The FBI and Secret Service raid the kidnappers' home and arrest them. When they find Mrs. Carlisle buried, but alive, beneath the floor of the farmhouse, Doug and his agents volunteer to do the digging. Tess then insists that her Secret Service detail accompany her to the hospital, forcing several high-ranking law enforcement officials to leave the rescue helicopter.  Upon being released from the hospital, Tess refuses to obey the hospital rule that patients must be discharged in a wheelchair. Doug tells her, using her first name for the first time, "Tess, get in the god damn chair." After a brief pause, Tess complies, pats Doug's hand and says, "Very good, Douglas."  
H.P. Lovecraft's: Necronomicon
  The film is broken into four separate features: "The Library", "The Drowned", "The Cold" and "Whispers". "The Library" segment is the wrap-around story, which begins and ends the movie.  ===The Library=== In the wrap-around story of the film, [[H. P. Lovecraft]] ([[Jeffrey Combs]]) learns of a monastery where a copy of the [[Necronomicon]] is held. Having been a regular there for his research, he sets up an appointment, his cab driver told to wait outside. Taking insult when the head monk calls his work "fiction", Lovecraft insists that all his writings are true. Requesting to read the ''Alchemical Encyclopedia Vol. III'', Lovecraft steals a key from another monk and flees to the cellar where the Necronomicon is being held. Unknown to him, a monk has seen him. Unlocking the vault where the book is held, the door closes behind Lovecraft unexpectedly, making him drop the key down a grating and into the water below.  As that happens, one of the seals is opened.  Lovecraft sits to read and record what he is reading. It's not specified if he sees visions of the future through the book, or if the book contains future accounts. It's likely the stories will come to pass, and for the Necronomicon have ''already'' passed, alluding to the Necronomicon's timelessness, as all the stories take place well beyond the 1920s.  ===The Drowned=== Edward De LaPoer, a member of the De La Poer family, is tracked down in Sweden after inheriting an old, abandoned family hotel. Left a sealed envelope from Jethro De La Poer, he learns of his uncle's tragic death. Upon a boat trip return to New England, a crash on the shore killed Jethro's wife and son. Distraught, Jethro picked up a copy of the Holy Bible in front of several funeral mourners, tossed it into the fireplace and announced that any god who would take from him is not welcome in his home.  That night, an odd fishman arrives and tells him he is "not alone", then leaves behind an English translation of the Necronomicon. Using the book, Jethro brings his family back to life. However, they are revived as unholy monsters with green glowing eyes and tentacles in their mouths. Feeling guilty, he chooses to commit suicide by casting himself off an upper floor balcony.  Edward, distraught over a car accident years before which killed his wife, Clara, finds the Necronomicon and performs the ritual to revive her. That night, Clara arrives and asks to be invited in. Edward apologizes for the accident. Tentacles extrude from Clara's regurgitates mouth, and in a panic, Edward pushes her away. Clara angrily attacks, but Edward, with a sword taken from a nearby wall, cuts her. She turns into a tentacle leading underneath the floor. Drawn underground from the injury, the creature below destroys the main floor and rises, a gigantic monster with tentacles, one eye and a large mouth. Edward cuts a rope holding the chandelier, jumps to it and climbs to the ceiling. "Clara" again tries to restrain him, but Edward destroys a stained glass window, the sunlight driving her away.  Edward pushes the chandelier rope free from the pulley, the pointed bottom piercing the monster in the eye, presumably killing it. Now on the roof, Edward has avoided the same fate that Jethro had years before, and decides to live.  ===The Cold=== Reporter Dale Porkel is suspicious of a string of strange murders in Boston over the past several decades. Confronting a woman at a local apartment building, he is invited in only to find the entire place is very cold. The woman he has confronted claims to suffer a rare skin condition which has left her sensitive to heat and light. Demanding the truth or his story runs as-is, Dale is told the story of Emily Osterman's arrival to Boston twenty years before.  Emily had supposedly taken residence in the apartment building, and told by Lena, the owner, not to disturb the other tenant, Dr. Richard Madden, a scientist. Her first night, she is attacked by her sexually abusive stepfather, Sam, who has tracked her down. Running away, the two struggle on the steps leading to the next apartment. Dr. Madden opens his door, grabs Sam's arm and stabs his hand with a scalpel. The fall down from the stairs kills him. Emily is bandaged up and given medication. That night, Emily is roused by drilling noises and blood dripping from her ceiling. Heading upstairs, she finds Dr. Madden and Lena mutilating Sam. She passes out, to awaken later in her bed with a clean ceiling. Dr. Madden assures her she was having a nightmare.  The next day while job hunting, Emily sees two cops with a flyer asking for information about the murder of Sam. She confronts Dr. Madden, and he comes clean: Though Sam was already dead from the fall, Dr. Madden claims he would have killed Sam regardless for what he had done to Emily. Dr. Madden reveals his copy of the Necronomicon and how he learned of its information on sustaining life. In the greenhouse, Dr. Madden proves this by injecting a wilted rose with a compound to revive it, claiming that as long as it is kept out of the sun, it will never die. The two have sex, with a distraught Lena spying on them.  That night, Lena threatens to kill Emily if Emily will not kill her, as Lena is in love with Dr. Madden, a feeling that has never been returned. Emily flees, only to return months later. Upon arrival, Emily finds her boss from the diner in Dr. Madden's apartment, struggling to avoid death. Lena stabs the man in the back, killing him. Lena insists on killing Emily, but Dr. Madden will not allow it, the struggle destroying lab equipment in the process. The resulting fire injures Dr. Madden severely, and without his fresh injection of pure spinal fluid, feels no pain as his body disintegrates before he dies. Lena shoots Emily with a shotgun in revenge. Emily announces her pregnancy, and Lena, feeling a loyalty to Dr. Madden, saves her.  Dale suspects the woman he's talking to is not Emily's daughter, but Emily herself, having contracted a disease from Dr. Madden during intercourse. Emily reveals he is right, and that she is still pregnant, hoping one day that her baby may be born. She also reveals that she has continued murdering for spinal fluid, and chooses to keep a supply stockpiled. Dale realizes his coffee has been drugged as an aged Lena approaches him, brandishing a syringe.  ===Whispers=== During a pursuit of a suspect known as "the Butcher", two police officers, Paul and Sarah of the Philadelphia Police Department, are arguing over their failed relationship and the coming baby. The argument leads to a crash, flipping the cruiser upside down. Paul, having unbuckled his seat belt in the argument, is knocked out and dragged off by an unseen person. Sarah unbuckles herself, breaks the window and exits the vehicle. Unable to call for backup, she follows a blood trail alone.  Inside the old warehouse, Sarah follows as Paul is taken down a service elevator. Sarah trips on a rope and falls through to the floor, saved from impact by the rope around her ankle. The rope breaks a second after. As she gets up, she finds a man in glasses, Harold Benedict. Insisting he is merely the landlord of the warehouse and the Butcher is a tenant, he offers to lead her to him. Downstairs, the two are shot at by Mrs. Benedict, a blind old woman. Sarah, sick of getting a run-around, takes the shotgun and orders the two to lead her to the Butcher. Mrs. Benedict indulges in gossip first, insisting she's not really Benedict's wife. She also claims the Butcher is an alien. While searching for the Butcher, Sarah makes her way to an underground cavern filled with bat-like creatures and other monstrosities, but the Benedicts pull the ladder from the hole, leaving Sarah trapped. As Sarah ventures through the cavern, she starts to become scared, even promising to keep her unborn child. She later sees Paul, but he has already been eaten by the bat-like creatures that inhabit the cavern. His brains are needed by the bats to reproduce. The bats then begin to corner her. She later wakes up on a table where Mr. and Mrs. Benedict are seemingly trying to feed Sarah to the alien bats.  Sarah suddenly wakes up in a hospital. Her mother and a doctor (who resemble the Benedicts) rush into her room. Sarah was forced to have an abortion as a result of the car accident earlier, but her mother insists that she will be forgiven if she forgives herself. Sarah wants to see Paul, but Paul is brain dead and turns out to be in the very same state that he was found back in the caverns. Sarah screams in terror in spite of her mother's pleas to not scare the baby. Sarah does not understand what her mother is talking about, as she thought the baby had to be aborted. Her mother opens her blouse and reveals that the baby is inside the womb of the alien-bat creatures. Sarah is even more scared especially after removing her bed sheets and finding out she has lost half of one of her arms. Suddenly, the hospital setting changes back into the cavern. Sarah is still on the table, about to become a meal for the alien bats. Harold wants to leave but Sarah still has the keys.  ===The Library=== With the conclusion of the third tale, Lovecraft is confronted by the head monk, who assures him that all will be fine if he opens the door. Lovecraft admits he dropped the key. Furious, the monk warns Lovecraft to replace the book, but the author is attacked by a monster in the water beneath him, and the last of the seals opens up. The head monk reveals himself to not be human at all, as he begins stretching his body through the bars to enter the room, and Lovecraft uses a sword in his cane to defeat the monster in the water.   Gathering his things and grabbing the book, Lovecraft begins to depart, being caught by one of the monks who warns him of the foolishness of his actions, telling him he will pay for his misdeeds. Lovecraft then escapes to the taxi and orders it to leave, and it leaves unpursued.

 Caesar is having a hard time dividing his time between his band and his rich girlfriend, Buffer, whose father hates him. Buffer's father calls Caesar in to make a bet: If Caesar makes $100,000 within six months, he can have Buffer; if he does not, he is banished from her life.  
Gunmen (1994 film)
 Wheelchair-bound drug baron Peter Loomis ([[Patrick Stewart]]) has his $400 million drug fortune stolen in South America by his errand boy Carlos, who stashed the fortune on an undisclosed boat in an undisclosed harbor. Loomis sends ruthless killer Armor O'Malley ([[Denis Leary]]) to find the boat and recover the money—he and sidekick Marie ([[Brenda Bakke]]) kill Carlos before they can get the name and location of the boat, but they learn that Carlos's brother Dani ([[Christopher Lambert]]) knows where it is, and set out to find him.  Dani is sprung from a South American prison by Cole Parker ([[Mario Van Peebles]]), a bounty hunter working for the DEA who is bent on taking down Loomis—Cole knows the name of the boat, Dani knows the location, and both men want the money for their own reasons. Complicating matters is a mole in the DEA who feeds intel to O'Malley about the heroes' movements. Alone and outnumbered, Cole and Dani are forced into a reluctant alliance as they quest for the 400 million dollar boat, with O'Malley and his men chasing them every step of the way.  Loomis quickly realizes that O'Malley wants the fortune for himself and tries to have him and his men assassinated, but the attempt fails. O'Malley returns to Loomis's estate and makes it clear that he now wears the pants in their relationship: without the $400 million, Loomis can't pay his soldiers, and O'Malley will get his hands on the money before the stay-at-home cripple does. Loomis is killed and O'Malley renews the chase with a small army at his disposal.  After numerous betrayals on both sides of the conflict, the chase ends at a Puerto Vallarta harbor, and a yacht called the "Matador" according to Cole. Dani and Cole shoot it out with O'Malley's soldiers and leave the boat a flaming wreck (and Dani beside himself at the loss of the money). But Cole reveals he lied about the boat name to mislead and eliminate O'Malley: the fortune was actually stashed on a rickety old fishing boat called the "Gunmen." The heroes agree to split the money and sail into the sunset.  
Guyver: Dark Hero
 One year after bonding with the Guyver unit and destroying the Cronos Corporation, the company responsible for the Guyver and the creatures called the Zoanoids, in Los Angeles, Sean Barker has been using his powers to fight crime. Unfortunately, the Guyver unit’s desire to kill has left Sean emotionally exhausted. Learning of cave drawings discovered in the mountains of Utah that resemble the images he has been seeing in his dreams, Sean makes his way to the archeological dig taking place there. Along the way, Sean encounters Cori Edwards, daughter of Marcus Edwards, the lead archeologist at the archaeological site.   Arriving at the archeological site, Sean discovers a skull resembling Lisker, a Zoanoid that he fought a year ago. Later that night, Sean battles another Zoanoid, called Volker, which has been terrorizing the mountains of Utah. Their battle is cut short by the arrival of Cori and her team which lets Volker escape. Sean is questioned by a suspicious Commander Atkins, revealing that the Guyver only destroyed the Los Angeles branch of the Cronos Corporation and that another branch of Cronos is behind the Zoanoid attacks in the mountains of Utah.  The very next day, the team of archaeologists unearths an extraterrestrial ship. After several unsuccessful attempts to breach it, the ship mysteriously opens up a hatch for the archaeologists to enter.  Inside, Sean communicates with the ship and demands that it removes the Guyver unit from within him. Meanwhile, Cori discovers another Guyver unit that has been damaged, but Arlen Crane confiscates it from her. Attempting to confront Crane, Cori instead learns that Arlen Crane actually works for the Cronos Corporation and plans to terminate all non-Cronos personnel at the site. Cori is captured by Volker eavesdropping and is escorted in a jeep. The jeep is attacked by Marcus, revealed to be a Zoanoid, who battles both Monk and Volker Zoanoids but is eventually overwhelmed. At the camp, Crane reveals himself to be a Zoanoid to Sean who rejects his offer of an alliance to activate the ship and turn himself and the Zoanoids back to normal. Crane has his chief of security, Brandi, sedate and bind Sean. Atkins frees Sean who rushes to save Cori as the Guyver. After killing both Monk and Volker Zoanoids, the Guyver spares Marcus and reveals his identity to Cori.  At the camp, Atkins and his commandos prevent Crane from executing the archaeological team and safely evacuate them. However, Atkins is captured and his commandos brutally murdered when one of the Zoanoids manages to escape.   Sean reveals to Cori that he plans to destroy the ship. Whilst Sean communicates with the ship, seeing images of prehistoric times with the creation of Zoanoids and the Guyver units, Cori plants dynamites in the dig site but is captured by Crane and his Zoanoids. With Cori as a hostage, Crane demands Sean to deactivate the Guyver unit and surrender. Marcus intervenes and a battle ensues: Marcus battles Crane but is killed in the process, Atkins manage to kill Brandi, a Zoanoid as well, after electrocuting her and finally shooting her dead. Sean kills the Corben and Stenzoanoids Zoanoids before confronting Crane. Crane reveals that he merged with the second Guyver unit and transforms into a Guyver Zoanoid. Faster and stronger, Crane overwhelms Sean, stabbing him in the chest but Cori shoots Crane’s Control Metal. Sean removes the damaged Control Metal which causes the Guyver suit to begin consuming Crane. Sean uses his Mega Smasher to put Crane out of his misery.   Following the events, Sean reveals to Cori that the Guyvers were a failed experiment: in prehistoric times, aliens had attempted to turn primitive humans into Guyvers to fight their wars, but the humans rebelled, forcing the aliens to leave earth. Using his Control Metal, Sean instructs the ship to return to its home planet. With the battle won, Atkins attempts to recruit Sean to aid the government in fighting an underground war against the Cronos Corporation, but Sean drives off with Cori instead.

Heavenly Creatures
 In 1952 Christchurch, New Zealand, a 14-year-old girl from a working-class family, Pauline Parker (Lynskey), befriends the more affluent English 13-year-old Juliet Hulme (Winslet) when Juliet transfers to Pauline's school. They bond over a shared history of severe childhood disease and isolating hospitalizations, and over time develop an intense friendship. Pauline admires Juliet's outspoken arrogance and beauty. Together they paint, write stories, make Plasticine figurines, and eventually create a fantasy kingdom called Borovnia. It is the setting of the adventure novels they write together, which they hope to have published and eventually made into films in [[Hollywood]]. Over time it begins to be as real to them as the real world. Pauline's relationship with her mother Honora becomes increasingly hostile and the two fight constantly. This angry atmosphere is in contrast to the peaceful intellectual life Juliet shares with her family. Pauline spends most of her time at the Hulmes', where she feels accepted. Juliet introduces Pauline to the idea of "the Fourth World", a Heaven without Christians where music and art are celebrated. Juliet believes she will go there when she dies. Certain actors and musicians are "saints" in this afterlife.  During a day trip to Port Levy, Juliet's parents announce that they are going away and plan to leave Juliet behind. Her fear of being left alone makes her hysterical, culminating in her first direct experience of the Fourth World, perceiving it as a land where all is beautiful and she is safe. She asks Pauline to come with her, and the world that Juliet sees becomes visible to Pauline, too. This is presented as a shared spiritual vision, a confirmation of their "Fourth World" belief, that influences the girls' predominant reality and affects their perception of events in the everyday world.  Juliet is diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and is sent to a clinic. Again her parents leave the country, leaving her alone and desperately missing Pauline. Pauline is desolate without her, and the two begin an intense correspondence, writing not only as themselves, but in the roles of the royal couple of Borovnia. During this time Pauline begins a sexual relationship with a lodger, which makes Juliet jealous. For both of them, their fantasy life becomes a useful escape when under stress in the real world, and the two engage in increasingly violent, even murderous, fantasies about people who oppress them. After four months, Juliet is released from the clinic and their relationship intensifies. Juliet's father blames the intensity of the relationship on Pauline and speaks to her parents, who take her to a doctor. The doctor suspects that Pauline is [[homosexual]], and considers this a cause of her increasing anger at her mother as well as her dramatic weight loss.  Juliet catches her mother having an affair with one of her psychiatric clients and threatens to tell her father, but her mother tells her he knows. Shortly afterward, the two announce their intention to divorce, upsetting Juliet. Soon it is decided that the family will leave Christchurch, with Juliet to be left with a relative in South Africa. She becomes increasingly hysterical at the thought of leaving Pauline, and the two girls plan to run away together. When that plan becomes impossible, the two begin to talk about murdering Pauline's mother as they see her as the primary obstacle to their being together.

Another Immortal, Kane, is also interested in mastering the power of Illusion and is making his way across Asia, with two henchmen in tow (Khabul Khan and Senghi Khan). They burn a village, massacre its population and eventually reach the cave. Kane defeats and decapitates Nakano, despite Connor's attempts to save him. The energies released during the [[Quickening (Highlander)|Quickening]] cause the cave to collapse. The Highlander manages to escape, but Kane and his men are trapped. Their situation prevents them from participating in "The Gathering" of 1985.  In 1788–89 in France, Connor makes the acquaintance of Sarah Barrington, an Englishwoman visiting relatives. The two become lovers, but when the [[French Revolution]] begins, MacLeod becomes involved. He is captured and sentenced to death for treason against King Louis XVI of France. He is saved by his Immortal friend Pierre Bouchet, who tells him he is tired of his immortal life, and dupes the guards into executing him in MacLeod's place.

Brenda Wyatt, the woman he married after the Gathering, was killed in a car accident in 1987. Although Connor survived the accident, he still believes that "The Game" is over. In [[Japan]], two [[archeology|archaeologists]] have excavated a cave to discover whether the legend of the sorcerer Nakano is true. One of the archaeologists, Dr. Alexandra Johnson, whose interests will lead her to Connor MacLeod, resembles Sarah Barrington.  The excavations free Kane, who sets out in pursuit of Connor, sending Khabul ahead and beheading Senghi to gain his power.

When he arrives, he is found by Khabul: the two fight, and Connor wins. When Khabul's decapitated body is found, Lt. John Stenn goes on the trail of the main suspect of the 1985 "headhunter" case, Russell Nash – Nash was the alias used by MacLeod during the time of the Gathering. As Alex investigates a piece of cloth found on the site, she discovers that it is a shred of a kilt, with a design that designates a branch of the MacLeod family. This leads her to Nash Antiques, where Connor has returned in preparation for the battle against Kane. The Highlander is confronted at a former Buddhist shrine by Kane, who challenges him. Fighting on the holy ground is a violation of the Immortal Golden Rule; the battle ends when the blade of MacLeod's katana is shattered. Kane flees, and Connor decides to return to the [[Scottish Highlands]] to build another sword though his initial attempts are unsuccessful.  Alex tracks him down to give him a bar of finely refined steel that she found in Nakano's cave with which he forges into a new sword, and the two become lovers. MacLeod learns from Jack Donovan that his son John is on a plane for New York. Kane abducts John, and holds him hostage to lure MacLeod. MacLeod meets Kane in an old church mission in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], and follows him into an abandoned power plant for their final battle.

Afterwards, Sidney J. Mussburger, a ruthless member of the board of directors, learns Hudsucker's stock shares will be soon sold to the public; he mounts a scheme to buy the controlling interest in the company by temporarily depressing the stock price by hiring an incompetent president to replace Hudsucker.  In the mailroom, Norville is assigned to deliver a "Blue Letter" to Mussburger; the letter is a top-secret communication from Hudsucker, sent shortly before his death. However, Norville takes the opportunity to pitch an invention he's been working on which turns out to be a simple drawing of a circle and his cryptic explanation, "you know, for kids." Believing Norville to be an idiot, Mussburger selects him as a proxy for Hudsucker. Across town, Amy Archer, a brassy [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning reporter for the ''Manhattan Argus'', is assigned to write a story about Norville and find out what kind of man he really is. She gets a job at Hudsucker Industries as his personal secretary, pretending to be yet another desperate graduate from Muncie. One night, Amy searches the building to find clues and meets Moses, a man who operates the tower's giant clock and knows "just about anything if it concerns Hudsucker". He tells her Mussburger's plot, and she takes the story back to her Chief, but he does not believe a word of it.  The other executives decide to produce Norville's invention in hopes that it will flop and depress the company's stock. The invention turns out to be the [[hula hoop]], which initially fails but then turns into an enormous success. Norville allows success to go to his head and becomes yet another uncaring tycoon. Amy, who had fallen for his naive charm, is infuriated over Norville's new attitude and leaves him. Buzz, the eager elevator operator, pitches a new invention: the flexi-straw. Norville dismisses it and fires Buzz. Meanwhile, Aloysius, a Hudsucker janitor, discovers Amy's true identity and informs Mussburger. Mussburger reveals Amy's secret identity to Norville and tells him he will be dismissed as president after the new year. Mussburger also convinces the board that Norville is insane and must be sent to the local psychiatric hospital.  On [[New Year's Eve]], Amy finds Norville drunk at a beatnik bar. She apologizes, but he storms out and is chased by an angry mob led by Buzz, whom Mussburger had convinced that Norville had stolen the hula hoop idea after giving him his elevator job back. Norville escapes to the top floor of the Hudsucker skyscraper and changes back into his mailroom uniform. He climbs out on the ledge, where Aloysius locks him out and watches as he slips and falls off the building at the stroke of midnight. All of a sudden, Moses stops the clock and time freezes. Waring Hudsucker appears to Norville as an angel and tells him the Blue Letter that was supposed to be delivered to Mussburger contains a legal document indicating that Hudsucker's shares would go to his immediate successor, who is now Norville. Moses fights and defeats Aloysius inside the tower, allowing Norville to fall safely to the ground. Norville and Amy reconcile. As 1959 progresses, it is Mussburger who is sent to the asylum while Norville develops a new invention "for kids," an enigmatic circle on a folded sheet of paper that will ultimately turn out to be a [[frisbee]].  
House Party 3
 Christopher, a.k.a. Kid is marrying his girlfriend Veda, while his best friend Peter, a.k.a. Play is dipping his fingers into the music business and attempting to manage a roughneck female [[Rap music|rap]] act called Sex as a Weapon. Play books the ladies for a concert with heavy-hitting promoter Showboat, but when they decide to fire Play and hire a new manager, he has to figure out how to deliver them to the show or face the wrath of Showboat's female security force.  Things eventually begin to spiral out of control for the two, as Play is also planning the bachelor party while trying to keep Kid's three younger cousins from [[Detroit]] in line, and Kid's ex-girlfriend Sydney has come back to town, which is news that doesn't please Veda at all. To complicate matters more Kid's cousins hijack his bachelor party in retaliation for not letting them perform at it (moving it from the rented hotel ballroom to their Aunt Lucy's house) The party at the ballroom is a bust as Play's cousin Stinky invites very obese women to the party (he's attracted to heavyset women). Meanwhile, Showboat has been out looking for Kid & Play for his money but gets sidetracked briefly by Kid's mischievous cousins. Embarrassed by the poor turnout at his party Kid bails into the corridor and runs into Sydney (who is there for her grandparents' anniversary party). Sydney congratulates Kid and tells him that Veda is good for him. As they hug and part ways Veda comes out of the elevator and sees them hugging. She immediately jumps to the conclusion that Kid slept with her but her friend Janelle (who had been dogging Kid and the pending marriage throughout the film) comes to his defense and tell Veda she is wrong to assume Kid cheated. At the same time Play (who also disagreed with Kid getting married) tells Kid he is wrong for wanting to break off the marriage since he's convinced Veda doesn't trust him.  After Kid and Veda make up they head back to his Aunt Lucy's house to find an out of control party in progress (unbeknownst to Aunt Lucy who was up in her room). Just as Kid starts to curse his cousins out Play stops him and convinces him to celebrate his bachelor party here. At that moment Showboat arrives with his female hitmen and are about to attack Kid & Play when he hears Kid's cousins performing at the party, Play picks up on that and immediately informs Showboat that they were a new act he and Kid were working on. Convinced that they came through, Showboat pays what he owed them just as Sex as a Weapon arrives. They tell Play that they didn't like what was done to the three blind rappers earlier in the film (they were stiffed on the pay for a show) so they opted to come back to Kid & Play giving Showboat two new acts instead of just one. Showboat again pays up, and this time the cash was taken by Aunt Lucy who informed all that the money was just enough to clean her house.  The movie ends on Kid and Veda's marriage and Kid's Uncle Vester finding a woman of his own.

I.Q. (film)
 Is everything random "or is there a Grand Design?" muses Albert Einstein at the opening of the film.  And we are left with the ultimate conclusion that where true love is concerned at least, the answer is a resounding "Yes" to a Grand Design.  An easy-going garage mechanic, Ed Walters ([[Tim Robbins]]), meets Catherine Boyd ([[Meg Ryan]]), a successful [[Princeton University]] [[mathematics]] doctoral candidate, as she comes into the garage, accompanied by her resistant and critical [[English people|English]] fiancé, acerbic experimental [[psychology]] [[professor]] James Moreland ([[Stephen Fry]]). There is an immediate "electric" connection which Ed recognizes, but she is not yet aware.  Ed sees his future, briefly, and Catherine is a major part of it; they are married, and have children together.  "How long will all of this take?" asks Catherine, referring to the car repair, and Ed, thinking about their future life together, replies, "That's up to you".  His life purpose has suddenly been decided by a force of nature greater than himself.  Finding a watch she left at the garage, Ed travels to her address and finds himself face to face with [[Albert Einstein]] ([[Walter Matthau]]), who is Catherine's uncle.<ref name="Ny times IQ movie"></ref>  Albert—portrayed as a fun-loving genius—and his mischievous friends, fellow scientists Nathan Liebknecht ([[Joseph Maher]]), [[Kurt Gödel]] ([[Lou Jacobi]]), and [[Boris Podolsky]] ([[Gene Saks]]), quickly accept Ed as a friend and see Ed as someone who would be better suited for Catherine. The four of them bring their communal vehicle to Ed's garage to have it modified as a convertible, and chat with Ed about how to attract Catherine's interest. An amused suggestion by Ed to "borrow their brains" inspires them to try to help Ed look and sound like a scientist (i.e., a "[[child prodigy|wunderkind]]" in [[physics]]) temporarily, in order to garner Catherine's attention for Ed, while at the same time trying to convince Catherine that life is not all about the mind, but is also about the heart.  James's heart is virtually non-existent (as seen in his casual cruelty in his treatment of test subjects and limited awareness of humanity), while Ed's heart is adventurous and virtually limitless.  Einstein sees bringing Ed and Catherine together as his most enduring legacy to his niece, because she was of the mistaken opinion that her only contribution to the world was to be through her children, and that she therefore must marry a total intellectual because then she will produce genius children, like himself. Einstein realizes that Ed loves Catherine for herself, and will help her blossom into her full potential as a person full of life and spirit; a fellow world traveler with mutual interests as varied as the Boyd's Comet and the Seven Sacred Pools on Maui, which James belittled.  Catherine eventually sees through the "intellectual Ed" ruse Einstein and his cohorts had temporarily created in order to get her to give Ed some attention, but falls for Ed anyway, just as Einstein had hoped. A smiling Albert Einstein uses a small telescope to spy happily on the two young moonstruck lovers as they take delight in the return of Boyd's Comet and in each other's company. The film ends with both Catherine and Albert saying "Wahoo!", just as Einstein had earlier in the film while riding on Ed's motorcycle.

Muriel gets fed up with his constant donations and overall simplicity and throws him out of their apartment, asking for a divorce. That same evening, Yvonne leaves her apartment after Eddie shows up and threatens to stay until he gets $50,000 from her. Quite innocently, she and Charlie run into each other at the [[Plaza Hotel]] and, unintentionally, end up spending the night together.  During divorce proceedings between Muriel and Charlie, she demands all the money that he won for herself. He doesn't mind giving his share of it but she also wants the amount he gave Yvonne, and his steadfast unwillingness to do so causes her to take the case to court. Muriel lies in court about the numbers Charlie played to win the ticket, but doesn’t get caught. The jury (believing her narrative) decides in her favor. Yvonne, feeling guilty at costing him all his money, runs out in tears and tries to keep away from him. But he, by now hopelessly in love with her, finds her at the diner and tells her that the money means nothing to him, and they declare their love for each other. While ruminating about their future at the diner and considering a possible move to [[Buffalo (city)|Buffalo]], they graciously provide a hungry and poor customer with some soup, which he eats at the special table. He is none other than disguised reporter Angel Dupree, who takes photos of them and in the next day's newspapers publicly eulogises their willingness to feed a hungry and poor man even in their darkest hour. Just as they are moving out of town, the citizens of [[New York City]], touched by their generosity, send them thousands of letters with tips totaling over $600,000 ($ today), enough to help pay their debts.  After Muriel gets remarried to her new husband, Jack Gross, he flees the country with all the money from their checking account, revealing himself to be a con man. She then has no option but to move in with her mother in the [[Bronx]] and go back to her old manicure job. Eddie, now divorced from Yvonne, can only get a job as a taxi driver. Charlie happily returns to the NYC police force and Yvonne reclaims the diner. At the film's end, they get married and begin their honeymoon by taking off from [[Central Park]] in a hot air balloon that bears the ''[[New York Post]]'' headline "Cop Weds Waitress", just before the closing credits roll.  
Interview with the Vampire (film)
 In modern-day [[San Francisco]], reporter [[Daniel Molloy]] interviews [[Louis de Pointe du Lac]], who claims to be a [[vampire]]. Louis describes his human life as a wealthy [[plantation]] owner in 1791 [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]]. Despondent following the death of his wife and infant child, one night he is attacked by the vampire [[Lestat de Lioncourt]] while drunkenly wandering the waterfront of [[New Orleans]]. Lestat senses Louis' dissatisfaction with life and offers to turn him into a vampire, which Louis accepts. However, he quickly comes to regret it. While Lestat revels in the hunt and killing of humans, Louis resists killing them, drinking animal blood to sustain himself. He is disgusted by Lestat's pleasure in killing and comes to suffer tremendously as a vampire.  Wandering the streets of New Orleans, amid an outbreak of [[Plague (disease)|plague]], Louis can resist his hunger no more and feeds on a little girl whose mother has died in the plague. To entice Louis to stay with him, Lestat turns the dying girl, [[Claudia (The Vampire Chronicles)|Claudia]], into a vampire. Together they raise her as a daughter—Louis has a pure love for Claudia, while Lestat treats her more as a student, training her to become a merciless killer.  As thirty years pass, Claudia matures psychologically but still remains a little girl in appearance, and she's treated as such by Lestat. When she finally realizes that she will never grow old, she is furious with Lestat and tells Louis that they should leave him. She tricks Lestat into drinking the "dead blood" of twin boys that she killed by overdosing them with [[laudanum]] and she slits his throat. With Louis's help, she dumps Lestat's body in a swamp and the two plan a voyage to Europe. However, Lestat returns on the night of their departure, having drunk the blood of swamp creatures to survive. Lestat attacks them, but Louis sets him on fire and, in the ensuing blaze, they are able to escape to their ship and depart.  After traveling around Europe and the Mediterranean (but finding no other vampires), Louis and Claudia settle harmoniously in [[Paris]]. Louis encounters vampires [[Santiago (The Vampire Chronicles)|Santiago]] and [[Armand (The Vampire Chronicles)|Armand]] by chance. Armand invites Louis and Claudia to his [[coven]], the ''[[Théâtre des Vampires]]'', where the vampires stage theatrical horror shows for humans. On their way out of the theater, Santiago reads Louis' mind and suspects that Louis and Claudia murdered Lestat. Armand warns Louis to send Claudia away for her own safety, and Louis is intrigued to stay with Armand and learn more about the meaning of being a vampire. Claudia demands that Louis turn a human woman, Madeleine, to be her new protector and companion, and he reluctantly complies. The Parisian vampires abduct all three and punish them for Lestat's murder: imprisoning Louis in a metal coffin, and trapping Claudia and Madeleine in a room where sunlight burns them to ash. Armand does nothing to prevent this, but the next day he frees Louis. Seeking revenge, Louis returns to the Theater at dawn and sets it on fire, killing all the vampires including Santiago. Armand arrives in time to help Louis escape the sunrise and once again offers him a place by his side. Louis, however, refuses Armand and leaves for good.  As decades pass, Louis explores the world dejectedly alone and eventually returns to New Orleans. One night he comes across Lestat, living as a recluse in an abandoned mansion. Lestat asks Louis to rejoin him, but Louis rejects him and leaves. Louis concludes the interview, prompting Molloy to offer to be his new vampire companion. Louis is outraged that Molloy hasn't understood the tale of suffering he has related and scares him into abandoning his idea. After Louis vanishes, Molloy runs to his car and takes off. On the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] Lestat appears and attacks him, taking control of the car. Revived by Molloy's blood, Lestat offers him the choice that he "never had"—whether or not to become a vampire.

The Jungle Book (1994 film)
 In 1886, during the [[British Raj]] in [[India]], Mowgli (Sean Naegeli) is the 5-year-old son of the widowed Nathoo, whose wife [[Maternal death|died in childbirth]]. Nathoo works as a tour guide. On one of his tours, he is leading Colonel Geoffrey Brydon ([[Sam Neill]]) and his men as well as Brydon's 5-year-old daughter Katherine ([[Joanna Wolff]]). Unfortunately, fellow tour guide Buldeo and a few soldiers kill several animals for sport. This enrages [[Shere Khan]], A Tiger who serves as the Jungle's keeper and begins to pursue the tour group. That night Mowgli tells his father of a dream where he faced Shere Khan and showed no fear, becoming a Tiger himself. Shere Khan attacks the encampment. He succeeds in killing the two soldiers, but when he tries to kill Buldeo, Nathoo defends Buldeo, who ungratefully leaves him to be mauled to death by the Tiger. In the confusion, Mowgli is lost in the jungle with his pet wolf cub, [[Grey Brother]]. Brydon and his men believe Mowgli has been killed too. Mowgli is taken by [[Bagheera]], a gentle black panther, to the wolf pack. Mowgli also befriends a bear cub named [[Baloo]].  Twenty years later, Mowgli, now a young man, discovers Monkey City, a legendary ancient city filled with treasure belonging to [[King Louie]] the [[Orangutan]], who has his treasure guarded by [[Kaa]] the python. Forced to fight for his life, Mowgli succeeds in wounding the snake with a golden dagger that he retrieves from the treasure horde. Winning King Louie's respect, Mowgli keeps the dagger as a trophy.  Elsewhere, Katherine and her father are still stationed in India. She and Mowgli meet again, but neither recognize the other. Katherine is also in a relationship with one of Brydon's soldiers, Captain William Boone. Mowgli enters the village in search of Katherine. Boone and his men manage to capture him and find the golden dagger from Monkey City in his possession. Katherine discovers an old bracelet of her mother's, one she gave to Mowgli when they were children, and instantly realizes who Mowgli is. She and Dr. Julius Plumford (a good friend of Brydon's) decide that they must re-introduce Mowgli to civilization. In doing so, Mowgli and Katherine fall in love, much to Boone's displeasure. Eventually, Boone convinces Mowgli to tell him of Monkey City and the treasure hoard that it holds, but refrains from revealing its location to him upon realizing his lack of respect for the jungle. Boone later proposes to Katherine, and she accepts. Around this time, after Boone and his men publicly humiliate him, Mowgli returns to the jungle as he does not feel at home in the village. After Boone's cruel treatment of Mowgli, Katherine realizes she cannot marry Boone, so she decides to go back to England to get away from him.  Meanwhile, Boone and his associates Lieutenant Wilkins and Sergeant Harley team up with Buldeo. The men recruit a jungle guide, Tabaqui, and gather some bandits to capture Mowgli in order to find out where the treasure is. Wilkins and Boone shoot Baloo when he comes to Mowgli's defense, much to Mowgli's distress. Buldeo and the bandits then ambush Katherine and her father (who is shot and wounded in the process). Even though Mowgli, along with Bagheera, Grey Brother, and the rest of the wolves, attack and kill most of the bandits, Buldeo manages to capture Katherine and her father and hands them over to Boone and his men, who plan to use them as blackmail: If Mowgli leads them to the treasure, Katherine and her father shall live. That night, the group learn Shere Khan is hunting them, enraged at Baloo being shot. Because of this Mowgli decides to escape.  The next morning, Harley catches Mowgli escaping with the aid of Bagheera and gives chase, only to fall into [[quicksand]] and drown, despite Wilkins' attempts to save him. Mowgli then has an elephant take the injured Brydon back to the village, after promising him to rescue Katherine. As the day progresses, Mowgli kills Tabaqui in self-defense when the latter attacks and tries to murder him. As the group reaches the outside of Monkey City, Wilkins becomes separated from the group and walks right into Shere Khan, where, after a brief chase, the Tiger mauls him to death. Eventually, the remaining group enters Monkey City, where Buldeo inadvertently entombs himself in a trap while trying to shoot Mowgli. Only Mowgli, Katherine, and Boone reach the treasure room, where Mowgli and Boone engage in a fierce fight until Mowgli injures the soldier with another dagger. Mowgli then escapes with Katherine, while Boone begins greedily pocketing treasure, only for Kaa to attack and kill him.  As they escape from Monkey City, Mowgli and Katherine are confronted by Shere Khan. However, Mowgli shows no fear and stands up by roaring back at the Tiger who roars at Mowgli to make him run away. Shere Khan, impressed by Mowgli's bravery, acknowledges him as a creature of the jungle and allows Mowgli and Katherine to leave peacefully. Mowgli and Katherine meet both the Colonel and Baloo, both of whom have recovered from their injuries under Plumford's care. Mowgli becomes the new lord of the jungle after fulfilling his childhood dream of facing Shere Khan with no fear and he begins a relationship with Katherine.

As punishment, Joshua is [[flagellation|flogged]] by the rest of his gang. Joshua returns home. Jason realizes how badly he's been beaten, so he confronts the leader of the gang, Alonzo ([[Treach]]), who is Lyric's brother. As a result of this, the two have a vicious fight in a public restroom.  Jason then meets Lyric at the bayou and tells her that he can't leave with her. His nightmares occur because Jason took a gun from Joshua and accidentally shot Mad Dog in the chest, which is why he feels obligated to his family.  Things get worse when Joshua hears his mother tell Jason to leave town with Lyric because he doesn't owe her or Joshua anything. Joshua believes that Jason is leaving not only because of Lyric, but because Alonzo may take revenge. Joshua plans to kill them all in order to keep his brother from leaving.  Jason hears about Joshua's plan and heads to Alonzo/Lyric's house, but he's too late. He sees what has happened and rushes upstairs looking for Lyric. He finds that Joshua has a gun pointed at her neck. He draws a gun as well and is able to convince Joshua not to kill her. However Joshua's arm moves, causing him to accidentally pull the trigger and shoots Lyric. Jason carries her out of the home to a growing crowd outside the house.  Lyric is injured, but still alive. Joshua is fed up with his life and decides to end it all by [[suicide|killing himself]] (off screen), in earshot of everyone outside.

Junior (1994 film)
  Austrian Research geneticist Dr. Alex Hesse ([[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]) and his [[obstetrician|OB]]/[[gynecologist|GYN]] colleague Dr. Larry Arbogast ([[Danny DeVito]]) have invented a [[fertility drug]], "Expectane", that is supposed to reduce the chances of a woman's body rejecting an [[embryo]] and thus prevent a [[miscarriage]]. Unfortunately, they are not allowed to test it on women since the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] has not yet approved the drug; so Hesse and Arbogast cannot move forward in their research. The head of the review board, Noah Banes ([[Frank Langella]]), informs Arbogast that while the FDA has denied their team the right of human experimentation, the team has managed to receive a donation from fellow geneticist Dr. Diana Reddin ([[Emma Thompson]]) from the [[ovum]] cryogenics department.   A disappointed Hesse is ready to leave and start over in Europe, but Arbogast convinces him that in spite of the FDA's decision, they can still perform the "Expectane" experiment, because he has talked with a Canadian firm called the Lyndon Pharmaceutical, who is willing to give the two additional funding for their work provided that they find a volunteer for the experiment. When Hesse questions the chances of a woman taking an unapproved drug during pregnancy, Arbogast reveals that there is no need to identify the gender of the experiment and convinces Hesse to impregnate himself, using an ovum codenamed "Junior".  That night, Hesse has a nightmare in which his potential offspring has [[Terminator (character)|his own face]] pasted onto it. As the weeks go by, he complains to Arbogast that his nipples are hurting him, and then later, the normally aloof Hesse inexplicably lightens up and chats incessantly about walks, massages, and naps. At one point, Reddin tells Hesse that being a woman is not as great as it sounds, citing the [[menstrual cycle]]s which do not stop until [[menopause]]. Meanwhile, Arbogast's pregnant ex-wife, Angela ([[Pamela Reed]]), wants Arbogast to be the doctor delivering her baby, as the man she is seeing is currently hanging out with the band [[Aerosmith]]. Hesse begins to wonder what it would be like to be a father and watches some television commercials to have himself a good sobbing. He later begins overreacting, with Angela noting his practice of "mixing cuisines". When it comes time for Hesse to stop taking the drug and release the experiment's full results to the Lyndon Pharmaceutical, Hesse chooses not to stop taking the drug and decides to carry his offspring to term. Arbogast is annoyed that Hesse is choosing to have his offspring, but soon deals with it and attempts to keep it hidden from others. Hesse goes through his pregnancy term while he develops a relationship with Reddin, as well as revealing his pregnancy to Angela.  It is revealed that the "Junior" ovum is actually from Reddin's own body, making her the mother of Hesse's child, a fact which leaves Reddin angry and stunned at Hesse. Banes soon learns about the situation, and wants to take credit for the experiment despite having no role in it. Arbogast disguises Hesse as a woman and hides him in a retreat for expecting mothers outside the city, passing off his masculine appearance as past anabolic steroid use. Eventually, Hesse receives a visit from Reddin, who tells him it doesn't matter who's the pregnant one, because on the whole, Hesse is the father, and Reddin is the mother. Meanwhile, Arbogast reveals the experiment and its data to the Lyndon Pharmaceutical, who agree to become partners with Hesse and Arbogast and give the experiment potential for other future uses.  Later, Hesse starts going into labor, experiencing abdominal pain due to the damage that the baby is doing to his abdomen. While shut away in his resort room, Hesse calls both Arbogast and Reddin. As Reddin rushes to the resort from the laboratory, Arbogast calls a fellow doctor and tells him to evacuate the hospital and prep it for an emergency c-section for Hesse, but a hospital staffer overhears the doctor's conversation and alerts Banes about it. Banes calls the media to the hospital, to take credit and become famous, but Arbogast's fellow doctor alerts him about the media and Arbogast makes a detour to get a decoy for Hesse so he can have a private c-section. When Arbogast's car arrives at the hospital, he disappoints the media when he brings out his own pregnant ex-wife. Banes, who had summoned the university dean and the press to witness the world's first pregnant man, is discredited and fired.   Meanwhile, Reddin and Hesse have snuck to the back of the hospital and use the fire escape to get in. While acting as Hesse's decoy double, at the hospital, Angela goes into labor. Hesse has an emergency [[caesarean section]], where he is given an [[epidural]] even though he's at high risk, as is the baby. Reddin, not being able to help Hesse through this time, is sent by Arbogast to keep Angela company. Reddin walks into the waiting room to find Angela in labor and ends up being her labor coach, since there's no hospital staff available. Hesse feels emotionally scared and horrible, as Arbogast and the other surgeon cut through the last few layers of tissue to get to the baby; Hesse eventually gives birth to a healthy baby girl. Arbogast announces the arrival to Reddin, who is on hands and knees helping Angela cope with contractions. Reddin hands Angela over to Arbogast and rushes off to see Hesse as Arbogast has Angela prepped for childbirth. Reddin visits Hesse in the Post-op, getting her first glance at her baby, and together, they decide to name the baby girl Junior.

Karuththamma
 Mokkatha (Vani), a wife of Mokkaiyan ([[Periyar Dasan]]), a farmer in Pottalpetti village, is in labour. They already have two daughters and are keen to have a son; two daughters born earlier were killed soon after birth by feeding them with poisonous cactus extract. Unable to pay hefty dowries for their daughters marriage, the villagers consider female infanticide to be acceptable. A new school teacher ([[R. Sundarrajan (director)|R. Sundarrajan]]) feels sad on learning about this heinous practice. When Mokkatha delivers a girl again, Mokkaiyan orders the village midwife ([[S. N. Lakshmi]]) to kill the baby. The midwife sadly tries to feed the cactus extract to the baby at a secluded place. The school teacher notices, meets her and requests to handover the infant so that he can bring up her. She hands over and he moves away from the village with the child.  As years roll by, Stephen ([[Raja (Tamil actor)|Raja]]), a veterinary doctor, comes to the village. Mokkaiyan's first daughter Ponnatha ([[Saranya Ponvannan]]) is married to Thavasi ([[Ponvannan]]). The second daughter Karuthamma ([[Rajashree (actress)|Rajashree]]) takes care of the family. After getting into some tiff with Stephen, Karuthamma falls in love with him.  Ponnatha has two daughters, and is pregnant for the third time. Unfortunately, when a girl is born again, Kaliamma ([[Vadivukkarasi]]), her mother-in-law and Mokkaiyan's sister, orders to kill it. To save her child, Ponnatha escapes with her baby and is chased by Thavasi, who beats her to death; the child also dies. He and Kaliamma enact a drama that Ponnatha committed suicide as her third child also a girl.  Karuthamma, devastated with the death of her sister, does not believe this story. Ponnatha had earlier expressed her fear to her that if she delivered a girl again, Kaliamma would kill her. When Karuthamma is giving a ceremonial bath to Ponnatha's baby, she notices bloodstains on her abdomen. Concluding that she was murdered, Karuthamma stops the funeral and rushes to complain to the police. The village chairman Chellamuthu (Kamalasekhar), who is close to Thavasi, asks the police not to intervene, hence the police do not. Karuthamma refuses to leave the station. Stephen, who is passing by, threatens action against the police if they do not act on her complaint, as he is also a government employee. Left with no option, the police take Ponnatha's body away and arrest Thavasi and Kaliamma.  Dr. Rosy ([[Maheswari]]), a teacher's daughter, comes to meet her close relative Stephen. Her presence and closeness with Stephen is misunderstood by Karuthamma. Rosy loves Stephen, but he only likes her. Kaliamma's husband ([[Janagaraj]]) celebrates her arrest by drinking with Mokkaiyan, who is not used to liquor. Mokkaiyan suffers a paralytic attack and loses control of his limbs. Rosy attends to him and in the process gets attached to Mokkaiyan and Karuthamma.  A few weeks later, when Thavasi and Kaliamma get bail, they come to attack Karuthamma, but Stephen saves her. Chellamuthu manipulates the villagers to accept Thavasi's proposal that Karuthamma must marry Thavasi to take care of Ponnatha's two young daughters (by which the police case will also be closed). Chellamuthu, who has lent money to Mokkaiyan, threatens and seeks immediate repayment if he does not accept this proposal.  Thavasi's father realises that his son is using the young children as bait and takes away the children with him one night. However, he is caught by Thavasi, who, motivated by Chellamuthu, burns his father to death. Thavasi takes the children away and forces Karuthamma to come with him to their village to marry him. Shocked with all this, Mokkaiyan consumes poison and is on his deathbed.  When Rosy expresses her love to Stephen, he gets surprised and states that he loves Karuthamma. Rosy is shocked as she was keen to marry him and decides to move away from the village. When the villagers asks her to treat Mokkaiyan who is fighting for his life, she does not as she is keen to leave. When her father, the teacher arrives, the village midwife realises that he is the same person who took Mokkiayan's third daughter. The midwife reveals to Rosy that Mokkaiyan is her real father; the school teacher also confirms it. Rosy treats Mokkaiyan, who now realises his mistake of killing female infants without realizing their worth.  Karuthamma, on the eve of her wedding, demands to see the children take away earlier by Thavasi's father. However, Thavasi is unable to show his children (as they were taken by Chellamuthu to use them as bait to force himself on Karuthamma). That night Chellamuthu makes Thavasi drunk and asks him to spare Karuthamma for that night. Thavasi agrees in a drunken state, which is overheard by Karuthamma, who also comes to know that Thavasi had killed his own father. When Chellamuthu goes to meet Karuthamma, she is well prepared to meet him. She murders Chellamuthu and then Thavasi. After saving Ponnatha's children, who were locked inside a box, she returns to her village. Realising that Rosy is her own sister, Karuthamma asks her to look after the children and their father and leaves with the police. Stephen is sad but decides to wait for her.

The Kingdom (miniseries)
   Each episode of ''Riget'' and ''Riget II'' begins with the same prologue, detailing how the hospital, [[Rigshospitalet]] in [[Copenhagen]], was built on the site of the "bleaching ponds", which recur in the name of the street of the hospital's official address, Blegdamsvej, although the exact significance of the reference is never explicitly discussed in the series.  The show begins with the admission of a [[spiritualist]] [[patient]], Sigrid Drusse, who hears the sound of a girl crying in the [[elevator]] shaft. Upon investigation, Drusse discovers that the girl had died decades earlier, having been killed by her father to hide her illegitimacy. In order to put the spirit to rest, Drusse searches for the girl's body and ultimately finds it preserved in a specimen jar in the office of the hospital's professor of pathology, Professor Bondo ([[Baard Owe]]).  Meanwhile, [[neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] Stig Helmer, a recent appointee from [[Sweden]] to the neurosurgery department, tries to cover up his responsibility for a botched operation which left a young girl in a [[persistent vegetative state]].  [[Pathology|Pathologist]] Dr. Bondo attempts to convince the family of a man dying from [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] to donate his liver to the hospital for Bondo's research. (In fact, Bondo wants it as a trophy, as it is the second largest hepatosarcoma ever recorded.)  When his request is denied, Bondo has the cancerous liver [[Organ transplant|transplant]]ed into his own body (as the patient signed an [[organ donation|organ donor]] form), so that the cancer will become his personal property and can be kept within the hospital.

In every episode, two dishwashers (each with [[Down syndrome]]) in the cellar discuss the strange happenings at Riget, and Stig Helmer screams his famous catchphrase: ''Danskjävlar'' (subtitled as "Danish scum", but "Danish bastards" or even "Danish assholes" might be nearer in meaning).  
Killing Zoe
 Professional [[Safe-cracking|safe-cracker]] Zed comes to [[Paris]] to help a childhood friend, Eric, with a bank heist. In the cab on the way to his hotel room, the cabbie obtains a prostitute for him. He arrives at his hotel room and is soon greeted by the prostitute, Zoe, who also confides that she is studying art, and has a "very boring" day job. After having sex, they talk with each other amiably, then fall asleep. Their reverie is soon interrupted when Eric barges in and brusquely sends Zoe out of the room, so the two men can get on with their business.  Eric takes Zed back to his residence where Zed meets Eric's friends. Eric explains his plans: the following day is [[Bastille Day]] and virtually everything is closed except for the bank they plan to rob, which is a holding bank and is open on holidays. Zed forgoes his rest time to spend the night partying with Eric and his friends among some of the less reputable people of Paris in a cavernous jazz club, which Eric refers to as 'the Real Paris'. During the binging, Eric confides to Zed that he has [[AIDS]], which he contracted through IV drug use.  The next day, Zed is awakened by Eric as they prepare to enter the bank. The team dons carnival masks to hide their faces before bursting into the bank. They quickly kill those who do not cooperate as they escort Zed (who has not witnessed the killings) to the safe so he can get to work. Their plans soon start to disintegrate as the police show up and they're faced with the possibility of going to jail for life or having to shoot their way out. Eric throws an explosive into a vault and enters it (mortally wounding a guard in the process - Zed himself shoots the guard as an act of mercy), finding a large supply of gold bars — but the thieves can't leave the bank alive with their fortune. Tensions become even higher when Zed recognizes Zoe (who coincidentally works at the bank) and attempts to protect her, to the fury of Eric, who viciously slashes Zed's cheek with a knife.   A vicious gunfight between the police, Eric, and the rest of the gang begins—with Zed caught 'innocently' in the middle. Eric's men are killed by the police as they rush the bank, and Zed and Eric begin to fight each other. The police shoot Eric to death. He falls on Zed, splattering great amounts of blood on him in the process (possibly exposing Zed to his HIV-infected blood). Injured, Zed is led away quickly by Zoe, who covers for him, stating he is a bank customer. They drive away in her car, where Zoe promises Zed that when he gets well she'll show him the 'real' Paris.   While some have speculated the title of the film derives from the assumption that Zed contracted HIV from Eric during the bank shooting and will pass it on to Zoe, Roger Avary has stated, "Zoe means 'life' in Greek, so the title of the movie can be interpreted as 'Killing Life.'

Kickboxer 4
 The film opens with a recap of earlier events in the series as David Sloane writes a letter to his wife, Vicky. After being framed for murder by Tong Po, Sloane has spent the last two years in prison, while his wife has become the sexual captive of his old nemesis, who has since become one of the most powerful drug lords in [[Mexico]].   After receiving explicit photos from Po of his kidnapped wife, Sloane takes his frustrations out on a fellow prisoner before meeting with a [[DEA]] official, Casey Ford ([[Nicholas Guest]]), who briefs Sloane about their situation. He reveals that the agency has been unable to apprehend Po by their own means and that Po intends to host a martial arts tournament at his private compound, with the winner earning a match against Po and a $1,000,000 cash prize. Knowing the history between them, Casey offers to release Sloane if he will enter the tournament and eliminate Po himself. Sloane eagerly accepts, using the alias "Jack Jones" to conceal his identity. His first stop is a street fight, where he easily dispatches two street fighters earning him a necessary invitation from a man named Brubaker, who scouts fighters and invites them to Po's tournament.   On his way to the border, Sloane enters a roadside bar and stumbles upon a group of thugs harassing a young woman named Megan Laurence. Sloane defeats them with ease and saves the woman, who is ungrateful for his help and reveals that she is entering the tournament as well. Sloane arrives at the compound and is greeted by Darcy Cove, one of Po's many female sex slaves, who tells him that he must compete in the qualifying matches. Sloane witnesses Thomas, a brutal fighter, take out another young fighter. Then, Sloane is chosen to face Laurence. Reluctant to harm the young woman despite her taunting, Sloane peacefully subdues her. He also meets up with an old acquaintance named Lando Smith, a talented fighter who turns out to be his backup on the mission.   At the party of the tournament's seventh anniversary, Bill, Po's right hand man, introduces Tong Po to the crowd. Sloane leaves the party soon after to search for his wife, but finds the entire compound to be heavily guarded. Meanwhile, Po offers Laurence a second opportunity to compete, but places a bounty on her head inciting all the other fighters to attack her at once. Laurence holds her own until Po attacks her, prompting Lando to intervene. After a brief standoff with Po, Lando escorts Laurence back to her room.  That night, Sloane searches the compound and manages to locate his wife, but is unable to free her before the alarm sounds. On Po's orders, the guards try to apprehend him, but they fail and Sloane escapes. The next morning, Sloane befriends Laurence and offers his help for the upcoming tournament.   The tournament begins with several matches taking place. Sloane witnesses Thomas incapacitate a female judoka fighter (Dana Dru Evenson), while Lando and Laurence both win their respective matches. When Sloane (as "Jack Jones") is called up to fight, Lando approaches Darcy to divert Po's attention away from him. Sloane wins his fight quickly and escapes Po's notice.   In an effort to gain more intelligence about Sloane's wife, Lando enters a romance with Darcy and presses her for information while offering to help her escape from Po. Darcy provides him with the necessary intel which he passes on to Sloane before being caught by Bill and his guards. Po tortures Lando to learn why he has come to the tournament, but unable to get a satisfactory answer, he brings forth Darcy and tortures her in front of Lando forcing him to admit that he is a DEA agent. Lando pleads for Darcy's life, but Po tortures her to death.   Meanwhile, Sloane seeks to free his wife, but is unable to find her since Po had her moved from her original cell as a result of his previous intrusion. Sloane is then captured by Po, who is surprised to see his old rival. On the final day of the tournament, Po declares that all fights will be to the death and dismisses several fighters who are unwilling to risk their lives, but shoots them all dead as they depart. The tournament proceeds with even more fighters killed at the hands of their opponents, until both Lando and Sloane are dragged into the arena.   Po announces that the tournament is a memorial to his late wife, Sian, who was killed five years prior when the DEA invaded his home. He blames Sloane for her death and offers a $500,000 bonus to whoever is able to defeat Sloane. Thomas accepts the challenge, but Sloane is able to defeat him. Po calls for more challengers, and the other two remaining fighters step forward. One after the other, Sloane proves to be more than a match for them. In frustration, Po orders Laurence to fight him, but she refuses, calling him a coward. Po threatens to kill them all if she does not fight, but Laurence asserts her belief that there was never any prize money and that Po intends to kill them all regardless, her words prompting the other fighters to rally against him. As one, the men rise up to fight for their lives against Po's armed guards.   The fighters seem to have a strong advantage, until Po himself enters the fray and begins to subdue them. Though he fights bravely, Lando is easily bested by the [[Muay Thai]] master. In the end, only Sloane and Po are left standing. After a brutal confrontation, Sloane conquers his rival once again, but Bill takes Vicky at gunpoint giving Po the opportunity to escape. Sloane dispatches Bill with a well-aimed knife throw before he and Vicky exit the compound along with Lando and Laurence.

Lamerica
 The film Lamerica is a story of two men caught up in the startup of a scam shoe company. The main characters [[Enrico Lo Verso|Gino]] and [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0224076/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm Spiro] (later discovered to be Michele), go on an adventure of misfortune. Gino is a young man originally from Sicily who is involved in a company that is trying to “give every Albanian good shoes,” but it truly is a scam.  Mr. [[Michele Placido|Fiore]] (Gino’s boss) and Gino were unsatisfied with the officials that were originally set up to run the company. With the help of an Albanian middleman, they decided to find their own candidate who would be a “man of straw”, meaning he would do what they say.  Spiro, or Michele, was the old man that the company hired to be their Albanian figurehead “chairman” of the company. We later learn that Spiro was a Sicilian named Michele and the problems ensued.  This film compares and contrasts the old Italian man and the young Italian man and their seemingly varying identities as two men. The major contrast between the two is not the country in which they are from, but the time period in which they lived. Spiro is from the “old” Italy, where fascism and a hard life was all he knew, and Gino is from the “new” boom years where the emphasis is on money and materialistic items. This difference is substantially indicated throughout the film. This adventure unravels Spiro's tragic personal history and allows Gino to become intimately acquainted with the full extent of Albanian poverty. This Albanian poverty is a mirror of how Italy used to be during Spiro's time. Gino's car tires are stolen, while the fancy shoes he gave Spiro are also stolen by children. Gino and Spiro follow a group of Albanians who are headed for [[Italy]] in search for a better life, first by truck and later by ship. The Albanian exodus parallels that of Italians for the [[United States]], which is where Spiro believes that they are heading.  
The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure
 Shortly after the events of [[The Land Before Time|the first film]], [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Littlefoot|Littlefoot]] and his four friends are living happily in their new home in the Great Valley, under their families' watchful eyes. One day, the gang attempts to get to the sheltering grass to play, but land in the [[tar pit|sinking sand]] surrounding it. The adults rescue them and subsequently chastise them for crossing the sinking sand. During the next night, the children have a secret meeting and decide that they need to prove they are mature by running away for a while into the Mysterious Beyond, a location just outside the Valley. Before they leave, they notice two egg stealers ([[Struthiomimus]]) named Ozzy and Strut, who have recently moved to the Valley, stealing an egg from the nest of Ducky's mother. The children chase the egg stealers into the Mysterious Beyond. During an ensuing landslide that leaves an opening in the Great Wall surrounding the Valley, the five are sent into the Mysterious Beyond, while the egg rolls safely back to the nest. In the Mysterious Beyond, the five discover another, larger egg and mistake it for the original.  The gang transports the egg into the Valley, and despite finding the original egg back in Ducky's nest, they decide to hatch it. The egg eventually hatches, revealing a baby [[Tyrannosaurus|Sharptooth]]. Littlefoot's friends flee, while he quickly realizes that the baby Sharptooth is not yet dangerous. Littlefoot tries to raise the hatchling on leaves; although this fails, the hatchling, whom Littlefoot names "Chomper," becomes content with a diet of insects. Littlefoot then hears his friends calling for help, as Ozzy and Strut are attacking them out of revenge for foiling their meal plans during the previous night. Chomper's shadow frightens Ozzy and Strut away, as they mistake him for an adult Sharptooth. The rest of the gang meets Chomper and they accept him as part of the group until he bites Cera by instinct. Chomper is told that this is considered bad behavior in the Great Valley, and he runs off as a result. The others follow him to a [[volcano]], where Ozzy and Strut attack the children again.  Chomper once more comes to the rescue, biting Strut's tail. The volcano then erupts, [[lava]] slowly oozing in the children's path. Littlefoot pushes a tree over a canyon to make a bridge for him and the others to escape the lava. Ozzy falls into the canyon while attempting to cross, and Strut jumps in after him. Once across, the young group encounters two adult Sharpteeth, who have managed to enter the Valley through the opening in the Great Wall, on the other side. They escape the Sharpteeth initially, but encounter them several more times. Eventually, the whole Great Valley population drives the Sharpteeth off, and the children make it back to their families, but Chomper feels left out and runs away again. The adults inquire as to how the Sharpteeth entered the Valley, prompting the children to explain their adventure the night before and the landslide that resulted. Realizing the landslide created an opening used by the Sharpteeth to gain access to the Valley, the adults set off to put together a plan to close the entrance for good, telling the children to stay behind.  Littlefoot runs to the forest to find Chomper. After finding him, they are chased and cornered by the two Sharpteeth again. Chomper roars at them, and they recognize him as their son and leave with him. Littlefoot is then kidnapped by Ozzy and Strut, who survived the fall into the canyon and now plan to kill Littlefoot by throwing him off the Great Wall, a plan hatched by Strut, much to Ozzy's surprise.  Later, Chomper hears Littlefoot screaming as Ozzy and Strut attempt to carry out their murderous plan. Chomper leads his parents to Littlefoot's location and tries to intervene, but is unsuccessful. Strut grabs Chomper by the throat, and he and Ozzy are poised to kill him, as well. However, Chomper's parents rescue Chomper, and unknowingly do the same for Littlefoot. The Sharpteeth chase Ozzy and Strut into the Mysterious Beyond. After they say their final goodbyes, Chomper follows his parents while Littlefoot returns to the Valley, later assisting the adults in sealing up the entrance between the Valley and the Mysterious Beyond.  Afterwards, Littlefoot tells his grandparents that being young is not so bad after all, but decides he still looks forward to growing up. An [[epilogue]] appears at the end credits in which Cera, Spike, Ducky, and Petrie’s siblings hatched while they sing a reprise of the opening song, “Peaceful Valley”. The film ends with the gang and their siblings running into the camera.

Legends of the Fall
 Sick of betrayals the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] perpetrated on the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s, Colonel William Ludlow leaves the [[United States Army|Army]] and moves to a remote part of [[Montana]]. Along with One Stab, a [[Cree]] friend, he builds a ranch and raises his family. Accompanying them are hired hand and former outlaw Decker, Decker's Cree wife Pet, and daughter Isabel Two. William has three sons: Alfred, the eldest, is responsible and cautious; Tristan, the Colonel's favorite son, is wild and well-versed in American Indian traditions; Samuel, the youngest, is educated but naive and constantly watched over by his brothers.  William's wife Isabel does not adapt to the harsh Montana winters and moves to the East Coast; Tristan vows never to speak of her again. At age 12, Tristan touches a sleeping [[grizzly bear]]. The bear awakens and injures him, but he stabs at the bear's paw and cuts off a claw.  Years later, Samuel returns from [[Harvard University]] with his [[Engagement|fiancée]], Susannah. Susannah talks with Isabel Two and learns of her fondness for Tristan. Susannah finds Tristan captivating but loves Samuel. Before they can marry, Samuel announces his intention to join the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] and aid [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in the fight against [[German Empire|Germany]]. Much to their father's displeasure, Alfred also joins. Although Tristan does not want to join, he does so to protect his brothers.  During [[World War I]], the brothers find themselves in the [[10th Battalion (Canadians), CEF|10th Battalion, CEF]]. Alfred, commissioned as an officer, leads a charge into [[no man's land]]. The attack results in heavy casualties and Alfred is wounded. While visiting Alfred in the field hospital, Tristan learns that Samuel has volunteered for a dangerous reconnaissance mission. He rushes off to protect his brother but arrives too late. A devastated Tristan holds Samuel until he dies, then cuts out his brother's heart and sends it home to be buried at the ranch. Tristan single-handedly raids the German lines. He returns to camp with the scalps of German soldiers hanging around his neck, horrifying his fellow soldiers. He is discharged but does not go home. Alfred returns to Montana and proposes to Susannah, but she declines.  Tristan returns home, where Susannah finds him weeping over Samuel's grave. She comforts him, and they become lovers. A jealous Alfred confronts Tristan and leaves to make his name in [[Helena, Montana|Helena]]. Tristan is plagued with guilt over Samuel's death and feels responsible for driving Alfred away; he leaves Montana for several years. Susannah waits for him, only to receive a letter telling her to marry someone else. Alfred comforts Susannah. William finds them together, which leads to a falling out between him and Alfred. William later suffers a [[stroke]]. He does not speak for years and the ranch deteriorates. Susannah marries Alfred, now a congressman. Alfred's business and politics cause him to get involved with the O'Banion brothers, bootleggers and gangsters.  Tristan returns during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], bringing life back to the ranch and his father. He falls in love with Isabel Two and they marry. They have two children, the elder being a boy named Samuel. Tristan becomes involved in small-scale [[rum-running]], finding himself at odds with the O'Banion brothers. Isabel is accidentally killed by a police officer working for the O'Banions. In a fit of grief, Tristan beats the officer nearly to death and is jailed. Susannah visits Tristan, still having feelings for him, but he refuses her advances. After his release, Tristan and Decker kill those responsible for Isabel's death, including one of the O'Banion brothers.  Realizing she cannot live without Tristan, Susannah commits suicide. The remaining O'Banion brother, along with the corrupt sheriff and another police officer, comes after Tristan for revenge. At the ranch, William and Alfred kill the attackers. Alfred reconciles with his father and brother. The family realizes that Tristan is likely to be blamed for the deaths, which prompts Tristan to ask Alfred to take care of his children. One Stab's narration explains that later during the night they bury the bodies and dump the car in the Missouri River. He reflects that rather than dying young as One Stab had expected, Tristan lived to watch his children and grandchildren grow. One Stab observes that it was the people Tristan loved and wanted to protect most that died young.  The last scene takes place in 1963. Tristan, now an old man living in the North Country, investigates an animal carcass and is confronted by a grizzly bear. He draws his knife and fights it.

The transaction becomes tense when the buyers pull a gun, but to Clay's surprise, they eventually pay him $700,000. Clay is left shaken, and on his return home he slaps Bridget, after she insults him. She then steals the cash from him, and flees their apartment while he is in the shower.  On her way to [[Chicago]] she stops in Beston, a small town near [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. There she meets Mike Swale, a local man back from a whirlwind marriage in Buffalo, that he refuses to talk about. He tries to pick Bridget up, and she proceeds to use him for mere sexual gratification during her stay in town. Adept at word games and [[mirror writing]], and with an imminent return to her hometown in mind, Bridget changes her name to Wendy Kroy, and gets a job at the insurance company, where coincidentally, Mike works. Their relationship is strained by her manipulative behavior and the fact he is falling for her.   When Mike tells her how to find out if a man is cheating on his wife by reading his [[credit report]]s, Bridget invents a plan based on selling murders to cheated wives. She suggests they start with Lance Collier, a cheating, wife-beating husband residing in [[Florida]]. This proves to be the last straw for Mike, and he leaves her alone in his place after an argument. Elsewhere, Clay's thumb is broken by the loan shark for not repaying his loan. Fearing for his health and in dire financial straits, he hires a [[private detective]], Harlan, to retrieve the money from his wife.   Harlan traces her phone area code, travels to Beston, and accosts Bridget at gunpoint, right after her argument with Mike. Bridget manages to murder Harlan, on the drive back to her place, and tricks the police into closing the case without further investigation by using local [[racial prejudice]] to her advantage. Bridget then resumes her manipulation of Mike and pretends to travel to Florida to kill Lance Collier. Bridget instead goes to Buffalo to meet Mike's ex-wife, Trish. Bridget shows Mike the money she stole from Clay, to convince him she has taken a cut from the life insurance payout from the new widow, as payment for the supposed killing.   Bridget tells him she has done it so they can live together, then tries to persuade him that he must also commit a similar murder so they will be even, and to prove that he loves her. She tries to talk Mike into killing a [[tax lawyer]] in [[New York City]], who is cheating old ladies out of their homes. At first he rejects the idea, but later agrees after receiving a letter from his ex saying she is moving to Beston. The letter was forged by Bridget to change his mind.  Mike goes to New York and breaks into the apartment of the attorney, who turns out to be Clay. After Clay is tied up by Mike, he manages to work out what is happening when Mike mentions Bridget's alias, and convinces him of the truth by showing him a photo of himself and Bridget together. They then hatch a plot to double-cross her, but she turns the tables by killing Clay herself. She tells a stunned Mike to [[rape]] her. When he refuses, she tells him she knows the truth about Trish, who is [[transgender]].   This causes Mike to have rough sex with her while acting out a [[rape fantasy]]. Unbeknownst to Mike, Bridget has dialed [[9-1-1]] and she coaxes him into confessing to Clay's murder as part of the role play. Mike is arrested for rape and murder, while she escapes with the cash, and calmly destroys the only evidence that could have been used in Mike's defense.

 Picking up where ''[[Leningrad Cowboys Go America]]'' left off, the band has settled in [[Mexico]] after charting a top ten hit there. However, many band members become alcoholics spending most of their day drinking [[tequila]]. Before long, more than half of the band members have died from excessive drinking. The surviving members have, in the mean time, become naturalized Mexicans, complete with mustaches, Mexican wardrobe but with their pompadours still intact.  Down on their luck and out of practice, the band and their road manager Igor (Kari Vaananen) receive an anonymous telegram, requesting their presence for a gig at the Surf Hotel at [[Coney Island]]. So they sneak past the Mexican–American border and make their way to [[New York City]]. When they arrive, they find out that the sender of the telegram was their ex-manager Vladimir ([[Matti Pellonpää]]) who, after going through an experience of being [[Born again (Christianity)|born again]], now calls himself Moses. Moses gathers the group at his room, and plans a return trip to ''the Promised Land'' ([[Siberia]]), for purposes that are explained later. After they leave for Europe, Moses takes the Statue of Liberty's nose as a souvenir.  While the others head to Europe by boat, Moses stows away on the wing of a plane. Inside, Johnson, a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent ([[André Wilms]]), learns of the missing nose through an article in the [[New York Tribune]].

Their first stop is [[Brest, France|Brest]], where Moses goes to secure gigs for the band for money. Eventually, Johnson catches up with them at a hotel in [[Amiens]] and, posing as a record producer (under the name Raymond Lazar), provides them with money to play for a wedding at the hotel. Johnson goes to the bus to find the nose there, but is knocked unconscious by Igor. The next day, they learn of his real identity from the CIA logo on his cigarette holder, and take him for the rest of the trip.  * In [[Frankfurt]], Moses is recognized by a gas station attendant, and phones the police. Igor is able to get some street toughs to bust them out, and they play a show before they set off again. * In [[Leipzig]], Moses and a fellow band member exchange phrases from the Bible and Communist Manifesto respectively. Later, they both tell the others of the birth of a sacred calf in their homeland, the reason for their journey home. * In the [[Czech Republic]], the band wash their clothes in the spring water. Johnson goes through the same experience as Vladimir/Moses, and renames himself Elijah. While in the area, the band plays for a local family. Later, Elijah is asked by Moses to sing the next song. * In [[Poland]], one band member gets sick, so after playing for money, they leave him by a hospital doorstep. Elijah attempts to bribe the sick member into bringing the nose back to America, but is turned down.  Before they cross the border to [[Russia]], Moses states that, according to The Holy Bible, he never sees the promised land. As Vladimir once again, he turns in empty bottles to the customs office as a distraction while the others sneak the bus across the border. Everyone is happy to see their return and have a party that evening. The film ends with Elijah being left alone with the nose.  
The Last Good Time
 The film opens showing a small New York City apartment building at night, where a young couple on the top floor are seen arguing. Charlotte (d'Abo) throws a bag out of her window, with some contents landing on the window sill of downstairs neighbor Joseph (Mueller-Stahl). Joseph takes some of the items, which includes a [[Locker (cabinet)|locker]] key, and by the next day, Charlotte and her boyfriend Eddie ([[Adrian Pasdar]]) have apparently vacated the premises.  Focus is then shifted towards Joseph, a widowed German/Jewish violinist who lives a simple yet structured everyday routine that includes writing in a journal about what he will wear, visiting Howard (Stander), an old friend at a [[nursing home]] who is in the final stages of [[Alzheimer's disease]], trying to make arrangements on a tax debt, buying food at a discount [[grocery store]], and then returning home to read books and play his violin.  Charlotte returns to the apartment the following evening to recover missing contents from her bag, but notices her boyfriend's car pull up while doing so and quickly rushes into the building. She asks Joseph for a towel to dry off after the heavy rain, but subsequently collapses on his apartment floor. He gives her a blanket and pillow and lets her sleep there.  After some hesitation, Joseph lets Charlotte stay in his apartment indefinitely. Despite the age difference, the two slowly form a platonic bond; Joseph discusses his past violin career and interest in philosophers; Charlotte reveals that her now former boyfriend Eddie was involved in [[organized crime]] and that the relationship was purely for financial reasons. Charlotte is additionally impressed that Joseph – despite his age – could remember the words of philosophers, whereas her former boyfriend – a one-time musician – could barely remember "words to his own songs."  While the two opposites slowly forge a more intimate relationship, matters begin to change dramatically for Joseph – due to tax collectors, he is forced to withdraw his life savings of $6000 from his bank account; his old friend Howard dies, and upon returning home with Charlotte from a bar one night, he finds his apartment ransacked, his violin smashed and his entire life savings stolen. Frank ([[Kevin Corrigan]]), Eddie's fellow [[gangster]], had been following Charlotte around and traced her to Joseph's apartment. Joseph then gives Charlotte the missing locker key, the item Eddie and Frank were looking for. Charlotte angrily asks Joseph why he had this all along but never gave it to her, and Joseph explains because he didn't want her to leave.  Joseph, back to being the lonely man he was before, slowly reconciles with his elderly neighbor Ida (Stapleton), who he introduced to Charlotte and Howard, but had also been unfriendly towards for being too inquisitive about his life.  Charlotte returns a few days later informing Joseph she sold the locker key to one of Eddie's criminal associates for $7000. She gives Joseph $6000 of that money – the sum Joseph lost – and keeps the remaining $1000 for herself to start her life over, claiming she knows a friend in the city who owes her a favor. The two kiss and say goodbye.  The same morning, Joseph knocks on Ida's door and asks if she would like to accompany him on a NYC ferry the next day. Ida is interested, and Joseph agrees to pick her up the next morning.  
Léon: The Professional
 Léon Montana ([[Jean Reno]]) is an Italian [[hitman]] (or "cleaner", as he refers to himself) living a solitary life in New York City's [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]]. His work comes from a [[mafia|mafioso]] named Tony ([[Danny Aiello]]). Léon spends his idle time engaging in [[calisthenics]], nurturing a houseplant, and watching old films.  One day, Léon meets Mathilda Lando ([[Natalie Portman]]), a lonely 12-year-old girl. Mathilda lives with her dysfunctional family in an apartment down the hall, and has stopped attending class at her school for troubled girls. Mathilda's abusive father ([[Michael Badalucco]]) attracts the ire of corrupt [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents, who have been paying him to stash [[cocaine]] in his apartment. After they discover he has been [[Cutting agent|cutting]] the cocaine to keep for himself, DEA&nbsp;agents storm the building, led by sharply dressed drug addict Norman Stansfield ([[Gary Oldman]]). During the raid, Stansfield quickly becomes unhinged and murders Mathilda's entire family while she is out shopping for groceries. When Mathilda returns, she realizes what has happened just in time to continue down the hall to Léon's apartment, who hesitantly gives her shelter.  Mathilda quickly discovers that Léon is a hitman. She begs him to take care of her and to teach her his skills, as she wants to avenge the murder of her four-year-old brother. At first, Léon is unsettled by her presence, and considers murdering her, but he eventually trains Mathilda and shows her how to use various weapons. In exchange, she runs his errands, cleans his apartment, and teaches him how to read. In time, the pair forms a close bond. Mathilda often tells Léon she is in love with him, but he refuses to reciprocate.   When Léon heads out for an apparent assignment, Mathilda fills a bag with guns from Léon's collection and sets out to kill Stansfield. She bluffs her way into the DEA office by posing as a delivery girl, only to be ambushed by Stansfield in a bathroom; one of his men arrives and announces that Léon had just killed one of the corrupt DEA agents in Chinatown that morning. Léon, after discovering her plan in a note left for him, rescues Mathilda, shooting two more of Stansfield's men in the process. An enraged Stansfield confronts Tony, who is violently interrogated for Léon's whereabouts.  As Mathilda and Léon recover from the ordeal, Mathilda attempts to seduce Léon. Léon refuses, instead opening up about how he became a cleaner; when Léon was young in Italy, he was in love with a girl from a wealthy family. The two made plans to elope, but when the girl's father discovered their relationship, he killed her out of anger and escaped justice. Léon killed the man out of revenge and fled to New York, where he met Tony and trained to become a cleaner.  Later, while Mathilda returns home from grocery shopping, a [[New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit|NYPD ESU]] team sent by Stansfield captures her and attempts to infiltrate Léon's apartment. Léon ambushes the ESU team and rescues Mathilda. Léon creates a quick escape for Mathilda by smashing a hole in an air shaft; he then reassures her, and tells her that he loves her, moments before the police blow up the apartment. In the chaos that follows, Léon sneaks out of the building disguised as a wounded ESU officer; he goes unnoticed save for Stansfield, who follows him and shoots him in the back. As he is dying, Léon places an object in Stansfield's hands that he says is "from Mathilda" before succumbing to his wounds; Stansfield discovers that it is a grenade pin. He then opens Léon's vest to find a cluster of active grenades which detonate, killing Stansfield.  Mathilda goes to Tony, as Léon had told her to do in the event of his death. Tony tells Mathilda he had been instructed by Léon to give his money to her if anything happened to him; he offers to hold it and provide the money on an allowance basis. Mathilda returns to school and meets the headmistress, who readmits her after Mathilda reveals what had happened to her. She then walks onto a field near the school to plant Léon's houseplant, as she had told Léon that he should "give it roots".  
Leprechaun 2
 On March 17, 994, a man, William O'Day, is seen trying to run from something. Suddenly, he begins to strangle and drop to the floor. The Leprechaun appears and warns him that if he tries to escape, he will kill him. William attempted to steal the Leprechaun's pot of gold and the Leprechaun locks a collar around William's neck. He announced that today, St. Patrick's Day, is his 1000th birthday. As a result, he can choose any woman to be his bride, provided the woman sneezes thrice whilst no one says "God bless you". He promises once his bride is married to him, he will grant William his freedom. He picks a young, beautiful girl who happens to be William's daughter. The Leprechaun uses his magic to cause her to sneeze three times; however, William intervenes with "God bless you, my child", therefore denying the Leprechaun his bride. William then tries futilely to run, but the Leprechaun uses his magic on the collar to lift William up and break his neck, but not before telling William that he will marry his descendant in a thousand years time on St Patrick's Day. He then kills William, whose corpse is then discovered by his daughter, who screams.  In present day Los Angeles, the Leprechaun has found a petulant sixteen-year-old girl named Bridget Callum, who is a descendant of the O'Day bloodline. She is fighting with her boyfriend, Cody Ingalls, because Cody, whose legal guardian is his uncle Morty, frequently has to break their dates in order to support Morty, who is an alcoholic scam artist.  Cody has to finish his tour so Bridget ditches him at the Go-Kart place to hang out with Ian, who abuses his privileges as manager to have someone cover for him while he goes with Bridget, the complete opposite of what happened with Cody. She flirts back with Ian and when Cody tries to apologize Bridget shuts him down and implies there won't be a next time. The Leprechaun steals some whiskey and a gold tooth from a homeless man and a gold ring off the finger of Tim Streer, a talent agent, who believes that the little man is some kind of performer. Cody's so upset about possibly losing Bridget to Ian that he tries to rush through the tour and gets pulled over by the cops and taken to jail. Morty comes to take him home and the homeless man gets dragged in at the same time, ranting about a Leprechaun that stole his tooth. Morty tries to convince Cody to forget her, but Cody leaves to go after her.  After a great date at the Go-Kart place, Ian drops Bridget off at home and tries to convince her to invite him inside, but Bridget shuts him down. Ian shows his true colors and tries to use all the good things he did for her like taking the night off and buying her food as a way of saying she owed him, and asks for just a couple of minutes inside of her house but Bridget says no. She tries to walk away but he grabs her arm and calls her a tease. Bridget punches him in the stomach and Ian gets ready to leave.  Suddenly the garage door opens and Bridget walks forward saying she's sorry and doesn't know what she was thinking. Ian asks her what she's thinking now and Bridget says she wants to make it up to him, while unbuttoning her blouse. Ian hears a laugh, also is creeped out by the garage and suggests they go inside but Bridget says she may change her mind again, seductively luring him in further, he bends down to hold her sides as she makes eye contact and she takes off her shirt and bra. The Leprechauns whispers to while the vision in front of him appears to be a true, a leprechaun's magic fools humans like him. It's revealed to be an overturned lawnmower with the blades exposed and starting up, Bridget asks Ian to kiss her and he pulls it forward while the camera pans to the wall as the blades make contact with his face, blood splattering everywhere.  Shortly afterwards, Cody knocks on the door and apologizes, Bridget thinks it's Ian and tells him to leave, threatening to call the cops. She opens the door and it's Cody offering flowers, which causes Bridget to sneeze all over his shirt. The third time she sneezes, Cody begins to say "God bless you," but is unable to complete the blessing when the Leprechaun attempts to strangle him with a telephone cord. After a struggle, the Leprechaun grabs Bridget and disappears, losing one of his gold coins, which Cody soon finds.  The Leprechaun takes Bridget to his lair and invites her to be intimate with him, but she resists. She then tries to run away, but he reappears at her side, and then uses his magic on a blanket, which he uses to tie her down with. He then tells Bridget he intends to modify her body in order to force her into bear his children (by either raping her or from willing sexual intercourse if Bridget will ever consent to it). When Bridget asks him why, he simply tells her not to worry because she will get used to the pain (implying that he plans to force her to bear him a significant amount of offspring). He then tries to seduce her with his gold, but notices one of his gold coin is missing, and sets out to find it. Bridget then begs the Leprechaun to untie her, by telling him she wants to look pretty for wedding night and for him because he's her husband now and she wants to please him. He then summons a red wedding dress and instructs her to wear it by the time he returns. He then calls Bridget's bluff by telling her to kiss him, which she refuses; he "kisses" her anyway by licking her cheek. Before leaving, the Leprechaun tells Bridget he knows full well she will try to escape, but it is hopeless.  While the Leprechaun is gone, Bridget tries to find a way out of the Leprechaun's lair, only to discover that the lair is enchanted and is akin to a maze without an exit unless the Leprechaun wills it to be so. At first, the Leprechaun's lair takes on the illusion of her house. Once she passes through a door, it once again appears like the Leprechaun's home and she realizes he was toying with her. Initially infuriated, Bridget takes deep breaths to calm herself. She then gathers rocks which she carries using the blanket she was wrapped in as a basket to mark the locations she has been in; however, the rocks disappear the instant they are dropped on the ground. She then drops the blanket and rocks in anger and walks around; she finds a box containing an awl, which she plans to save for later so she can use it as a weapon to kill the Leprechaun with.  The police soon arrive at Bridget's house. They discover that Bridget is missing, Ian badly injured, and find a note from Cody at the scene, leading them to get an arrest warrant out for him. Cody returns to Morty's house and tells him what happened; although Morty is initially convinced that Cody is crazy, he sees Cody was right when the Leprechaun breaks into the house and they barely escape.  Morty and Cody then go to a bar, which is filled with little people dressed as leprechauns, celebrating St. Patrick's Day. While there, Cody is given a piece of chocolate in a gold wrapper by one of the bar's patrons (Tony Cox). The Leprechaun appears, and Morty challenges him to a drinking contest in honor of his wedding; while the Leprechaun downs whiskey, Morty is actually drinking soda and water. The Leprechaun eventually becomes extremely drunk to the point he can barely speak properly or use his magic. He distracts Morty and Cody by turning on a jukebox with his powers, which in turn leads him to bash Morty in the head with a bottle in order to get away.  He goes to a coffee shop, where he sobers up, and takes the time to murder a waiter (Michael McDonald) who was making jokes about his size and speech; upon being asked for payment for the coffee, the Leprechaun (thinking the waiter wants to take his gold) kills him. Meanwhile, Cody and Morty break into the go-kart racetrack that Ian worked at (since the office contains a huge safe on wheels made of wrought iron, which is the only thing that can harm the Leprechaun). Cody traps the Leprechaun inside, but Morty takes advantage of the opportunity to claim three wishes and locks Cody in a store room. His first is for the Leprechaun's pot of gold, which causes the creature to appear in Morty's stomach, grotesquely stretching it. Morty wishes for the Leprechaun out of the safe so that he can help him, and, for his third wish, asks for the pot of gold out of him. The Leprechaun cuts Morty's stomach open and pulls out the pot, killing Morty. Morty begs for help as he dies, but the Leprechaun laughingly says "love to, friend, but you're all out of wishes."  Just then, as Cody breaks out of the store room, a security guard (who has responded to a silent alarm that Morty tripped) enters. The Leprechaun disappears, setting Cody up to take the fall for the brutal murder. Before he can arrest Cody, however, the officer is lured onto the track by the Leprechaun's impersonation of Bridget, and gets killed by being run over twice by the little green man in his own custom go-kart. He attempts to kill Cody for his gold coin, but Cody realizes that as long as he holds it, the Leprechaun cannot harm him, leading him to run to the Leprechaun's lair to attempt rescuing Bridget.  The Leprechaun returns home, anticipating Cody's arrival, where Bridget is waiting for him in the dress he ordered her to wear with her hair done and is wearing heels. Bridget pretends to have given into her fate as the Leprechaun's bride and tries to seduce him to lower his guard before attempting to stab his head with the awl; however, the attempt fails because the awl could not penetrate the Leprechaun's skin as it wasn’t made of wrought iron and broke as a result. The Leprechaun, enraged, tells Bridget it was his favorite awl and that his father gave it to him. He is about to punish Bridget, who begs him not to, but stops when he hears Cody's car arriving. To prevent her from going anywhere, the Leprechaun bound her collar (and her) to a tree.  Before he can find Bridget, however, Cody is attacked by the skeleton of William O'Day carrying out the Leprechaun's bidding. When he manages to fell the skeleton, he is encased in a tangle of tree roots. When the tree roots turn out to be an illusion, he finally stumbles upon Bridget in the Leprechaun's room. While the Leprechaun was dealing with Cody, Bridget used the awl to try to break off her collar.  Suddenly, the Leprechaun corners Cody, demanding that he return his coin. Bridget has been picking at her collar with the awl. She finally manages to break off the collar, throws it at the Leprechaun's head and runs, followed by Cody. The Leprechaun dusts off his hat and pursues them both ("A game of hide-and-seek! How lovely!").  Wherever Cody and Bridget run, they end up back in the same place; in their mad dash to find an exit, Bridget and Cody get separated. When they meet up again, Bridget convinces Cody to leave the coin behind on the supposition that the Leprechaun will stop chasing them if they give him what he wants. When Cody is reluctant to part with the coin (the only thing that is keeping the Leprechaun from harming them), Bridget takes the opportunity to turn on the charm and kisses him, so Cody hands her the coin. Bridget backs away and starts to laugh saying "You lose!" in the Leprechaun's voice. The Leprechaun makes the real Bridget appear; when she tells the Leprechaun not to hurt Cody and that she'll go with the Leprechaun, the Leprechaun agrees, and knocks Cody across the room; he then takes Bridget's hand, intending to lead her to their wedding bed (and be intimate with her).  Suddenly, Cody jumps up and shoves an iron crowbar through the Leprechaun's chest. As the Leprechaun begins to sizzle, Cody points out that the gold coin he gave him was actually the gold-covered milk chocolate that the St. Paddy's Day reveler had given him earlier. As the Leprechaun dies, his magic over the lair dies as well, and the exit is revealed to Cody and Bridget.  Together, Cody and Bridget run out of the lair, and the Leprechaun explodes behind them. In the final scene, Bridget asks Cody how he knew that it wasn't really her kissing him, and Cody informs her that her kisses are different. She then asks him whether he's going to keep the coin. "It's not worth it," Cody replies before tossing it to the ground. They kiss, and the film ends.

Mufasa shows young Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the "circle of life" which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother, [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]], covets the throne and plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba so he may become king. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala—to whom Simba is betrothed—into exploring a forbidden [[elephants' graveyard]], where they are attacked by three [[spotted hyena]]s who are in league with Scar. Mufasa is alerted to the danger by his [[majordomo]], the [[hornbill]] Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though angry with Simba, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba.  Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of [[wildebeest]] into a stampede that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing the king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge. Scar refuses to help Mufasa, instead sending him falling to his death. He then convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simba's own fault and advises him to flee the kingdom. He orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing his three hyena minions and the rest of their large pack to live in the Pride Lands.  Simba collapses in a desert and is rescued by [[Timon and Pumbaa]], a [[meerkat]] and [[common warthog|warthog]] who are fellow outcasts.

Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scar's reign. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return home.  Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar. Scar taunts him over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to Simba that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock.

Little Women (1994 film)
 The film focuses on the March sisters: beautiful Meg, [[Wiktionary:tempestuous|tempestuous]] Jo, tender Beth, and romantic Amy, who are growing up in [[Concord, Massachusetts]] during and after the [[American Civil War]]. With their father away fighting in the war, the girls struggle with major and minor problems under the guidance of their strong-willed mother, affectionately called Marmee. As a means of escaping some of their problems, the sisters revel in performing in romantic [[play (theatre)|plays]] written by Jo in their attic theater.  Living next door to the family is wealthy Mr. Laurence, whose grandson Theodore, nicknamed "Laurie", moves in with him and becomes a close friend of the March family, particularly Jo. Mr. Laurence becomes a mentor for Beth, whose exquisite piano-playing reminds him of his deceased young daughter, and Meg falls in love with Laurie's [[tutor]] John Brooke.  Mr. March is wounded in the war and Marmee is called away to nurse him. While Marmee is away, Beth contracts [[scarlet fever]] from a neighbor's infant. Awaiting Marmee's return, Meg and Jo send Amy away to live in safety with their Aunt March. Prior to Beth's illness, Jo had been Aunt March's companion for several years, and while she was unhappy with her position she tolerated it in the hope her aunt one day would take her to [[Europe]]. When Beth's condition worsens, Marmee is summoned home and nurses her to recovery just in time for Christmas. Mr. Laurence gives his daughter's piano to Beth, Meg accepts John Brooke's proposal and Mr. March surprises his family by returning home from the war.  Four years pass; Meg (now twenty) and John marry, and Beth's health is deteriorating steadily. Laurie graduates from college, proposes to Jo (now nineteen) and asks her to go to [[London]] with him, but realizing she thinks of him more as an older brother than a lover, she refuses his offer. Jo later deals with the added disappointment that Aunt March has decided to take Amy, who is now seventeen, with her to Europe instead of her. Crushed, Jo departs for [[New York City]] to pursue her dream of writing and experiencing life. There she meets Friedrich Bhaer, a [[Germany|German]] [[professor]] who challenges and stimulates her intellectually, introduces her to [[opera]] and [[philosophy]], and encourages her to write better stories than the lurid [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[melodrama]]s she has penned so far.  In Europe, Amy is reunited with Laurie. She is disappointed to find he has become dissolute and irresponsible and scolds him for pursuing her merely to become part of the March family. In return, he bitterly rebukes her for courting one of his wealthy college friends in order to marry into money. He leaves Amy a letter asking her to wait for him while he works in London for his grandfather and makes himself worthy of her.  Jo is summoned home to see eighteen year old Beth, who finally dies of the lingering effects of [[scarlet fever]] (presumably [[rheumatic heart disease]]) that have plagued her for the past four years. A saddened Jo retreats to the comfort of the attic and begins to write her [[narrative|life story]]. Upon its completion, she sends it to Professor Bhaer. Meanwhile, Meg gives birth to [[Fraternal Twins|fraternal twins]] Demi and Daisy.  A letter from Amy informs the family that Aunt March is too ill to travel, so Amy must remain in Europe with her. In London, Laurie receives a letter from Jo in which she informs him of Beth's death and mentions Amy is in [[Vevey]], unable to come home. Laurie immediately travels to be at Amy's side. They finally return to the March home as husband and wife, much to Jo's surprise and eventual delight.  Aunt March dies and she leaves Jo her house, which she decides to convert into a school. Professor Bhaer arrives with the printed galley proofs of her [[manuscript]], but when he mistakenly believes Jo has married Laurie he departs to catch a train to the West, where he is to become a teacher. Jo runs after him and explains the misunderstanding. When she begs him not to leave, he proposes marriage and she happily accepts.  
The Little Rascals (film)
 Spanky McFarland ([[Travis Tedford]]) is the president of the "He-Man Woman Haters Club" with many school-aged boys from around the neighborhood as members. Alfalfa Switzer ([[Bug Hall]]), Spanky's best friend, has been chosen to be the driver for the club's prize-winning go-kart, "The Blur", in the upcoming [[Soap Box Derby]] go-kart race. Unfortunately, Alfalfa is nowhere to be found.  The boys go to find Alfalfa and they discover him in the company of his sweetheart Darla ([[Brittany Ashton Holmes]]), with whom he is forbidden to be in love because she is a girl and that is against club rules. Alfalfa invites Darla on a picnic, and to prove his devotion to her, he agrees to have the picnic inside the Clubhouse. Unbeknownst to Alfalfa, his fellow club members find out about his plans.  At the picnic, Alfalfa and Darla think they are alone, but the other club members secretly pull several silly pranks to sabotage their romantic date (whoopee cushion, cat litter in sandwiches, etc.). When they finally reveal themselves and demand to come inside the clubhouse, Alfalfa frantically tries to convince Darla to hide in the closet, which causes her to mistakenly believe that Alfalfa feels ashamed of her. In the frenzy, a candle flame gets out of control, ultimately causing the clubhouse to burn down.  Darla breaks up with Alfalfa and turns her attentions toward Waldo ([[Blake McIver Ewing]]), the new kid in town whose father ([[Donald Trump]]) is an oil tycoon. Because Alfalfa burned down the clubhouse and also fraternized with a girl, one of the members, Stymie (Kevin Jamal Woods), assigns him to guard the go-kart until the day of the race.  Alfalfa makes several attempts to woo back Darla, including sending her a fake love note. When that attempt fails, Spanky goes with him to formally break things off with Darla. They are initially turned from the door of her ballet school, but Spanky insists that they will wait for Darla to come out; Spanky gives Alfalfa a frog to play with while they wait. They are soon spotted by the neighborhood bullies Butch (Sam Saletta) and Woim (Blake Jeremy Collins), who chase them inside the building. To get away, the boys duck into a costume room and disguise themselves in ballet drag. They manage to evade the bullies, but when they attempt to enter another room to get out of their disguises, they are surprised to find the room filled with girls, including Darla, dressed in ballet outfits. The boys nervously pretend to be in the ballet recital that is about to take place, but Alfalfa almost gives them away when the frog he is still holding croaks. Just as they are about to back out of the room, the ballet mistress ([[Lea Thompson]]) enters and ushers them all on stage.  Spanky and Alfalfa awkwardly try to dance along but Alfalfa immediately begins squirming in discomfort, for the frog was in his tights. The recital quickly falls into chaos, and Alfalfa and Spanky run off of the stage and dispose of the frog.  The ballet mistress, furious that they ruined her recital, confronts them and throws them out immediately, Alfalfa in his underwear and Spanky still in drag. Butch and Woim are waiting for them outside the door, so Spanky distracts them while Alfalfa sneaks out. When Spanky loses his wig, the bullies give chase. Spanky manages to lose them, but they bump into Alfalfa, who is trying to run home in his underwear. They chase him into a mansion but are turned away by the butler. Alfalfa gets through and escapes out the back door, but is chased by a [[Doberman]] and he leaps into a pool and swims to the other side, but just as he climbs out of the pool, he his underwear slips right off, now floating on the surface of the pool. As Alfalfa retrieves his underwear, he discovers Darla and Waldo in a hot tub, laughing at him, to his embarrassment. The doberman then chases Alfalfa off the property.  At the carnival talent show the day before the race, Alfalfa once again tries to win Darla back, this time through song, being that Darla mentioned after she dumped him that the only thing she ever really missed about him was his voice. Waldo and Darla also entered the show in a duet. Alfalfa then requests the chance to perform for her and win her back. However, Waldo sabotages his attempts to serenade her by putting soap in his drinking water, causing him to burp out bubbles all throughout his song.  The boys try to fund-raise $450, the cost of the lumber needed to rebuild their clubhouse. The youngest club members, Buckwheat ([[Ross Bagley|Ross Elliot Bagley]]) and Porky (Zachary Mabry), have unwittingly come up with $500, not realizing that their method for earning the money was not exactly honest. Their school teacher, Miss Crabtree ([[Daryl Hannah]]), finds out about the scheme and confronts them, but Spanky convinces her to donate the money to be given as first prize in the go-kart derby.  As a result of Alfalfa's carelessness, "The Blur" is eventually stolen by Butch and Woim, so that now, in addition to having to rebuild the clubhouse, the boys need a new go-kart. They band together to build "Blur 2: The Sequel," and prior to race day, Spanky and Alfalfa (who previously had a falling out when the latter discovers the gang's "prank list") reconcile their friendship and decide to ride in the two-seat go-kart together. They hope to win the prize money and the trophy, which is to be presented to the winners by A.J. Ferguson.  Butch and Woim make several sneaky attempts to stop Alfalfa and Spanky from winning the race. Waldo and Darla are also  in the go-kart race, but they're eventually annoyed with each other, and Waldo seemingly kicks Darla out from his car midway through the race. In a wild dash to the finish, and despite the many scrapes and crashes throughout the race, "The Blur 2" crosses the finish line ahead of the pack in a photo-finish between "The Blur" and "The Blur 2" literally by a hair, due to Alfalfa's pointy hairstyle. After the race, Butch and Woim are angry towards Alfalfa because he won the trophy and the prize money. They attempt to beat him up, but Alfalfa finally stands up for himself and punches Butch in the face, knocking him into a pool of pig slop. Woim then gets scared and jumps into the slop willingly.  Along with first prize, Alfalfa also wins back Darla, after it is revealed that it had been Darla who had kicked Waldo out of their car and finished the race alone because she found out that Waldo was responsible for the bubbles at the talent show. Spanky, meanwhile, is shocked at the trophy presentation when he finally meets his favorite driver, A.J. Ferguson, who turns out to be female ([[Reba McEntire]]). Spanky confesses to Darla that he and the boys pulled the pranks on her at their picnic lunch, not Alfalfa. After the club house is rebuilt, the boys collectively have a change of heart towards membership and they decide to welcome Darla as well as other girls into the club, adding a "Women Welcome" sign onto the front door.  
Little Buddha
 Tibetan Buddhist monks from a monastery in [[Bhutan]], led by [[Lama]] Norbu, are searching for a child who is the [[tulku|rebirth]] of a great Buddhist teacher, Lama [[Dorje]]. Lama Norbu and his fellow monks believe they have found a candidate for the child in whom Lama Dorje is [[rebirth (Buddhism)|reborn]]: an American boy named Jesse Konrad, the young son of an architect and a teacher who live in [[Seattle]]. The monks come to Seattle in order to meet the boy.  Jesse is fascinated with the monks and their way of life, but his parents, Dean and Lisa, are wary, and that wariness turns into near-hostility when Norbu announces that he wants to take Jesse back with him to [[Bhutan]] to be tested. Dean changes his mind however, when one of his close friends and colleagues commits suicide because he went broke. Dean then decides to travel to [[Bhutan]] with Jesse. In [[Nepal]], two children who are also candidates for the rebirth are encountered, Raju and Gita.  Gradually, over the course of the movie, first Jesse's mother and then [[Lama]] Norbu tell the life story of Prince Siddhartha, reading from a book that Lama Norbu has given to Jesse.  In ancient Nepal, a prince called [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]] turns his back on his comfortable and protected life, and sets out on a journey to solve the problem of universal suffering. As he progresses, he learns profound truths about the nature of life, [[consciousness]], and [[reality]]. Ultimately, he battles [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] (a [[demon]] representing the ego), who repeatedly tries to divert and destroy Siddhartha. Through the final complete realization of the illusory nature of his own ego, Siddhartha attains [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and becomes the [[Buddha]].  In the final scenes of the movie, it is found that all three children are rebirths of Lama Dorje, separate manifestations of his body (Raju), speech (Gita), and mind (Jesse). A ceremony is held and Jesse's father also learns some of the essential truths of [[Buddhism]]. His work finished, Lama Norbu enters a deep state of [[meditation]] and dies. As the funeral ceremony begins, Lama Norbu speaks to the children, seemingly from a higher plane, telling them to have compassion; and just before the credits roll the children are seen distributing his ashes.  At the very end of the film credits, the [[sand mandala]] that was seen being constructed during the movie is destroyed, "with one swift stroke."  
Little Giants
  Danny O'Shea ([[Rick Moranis]]) has always lived in the shadow of his older brother, Kevin ([[Ed O'Neill]]), a [[Heisman Trophy]] winner and a local football hero. They live in their hometown of [[Urbana, Ohio]]. Kevin coaches the local "Pee-Wee Cowboys" football team.  Despite being the best player, Danny's tomboy daughter, Becky ([[Shawna Waldron]]), nicknamed Icebox, is cut during try outs because she is a girl. Also cut are her less-talented friends, Rashid Hanon (who can't catch anything), Tad Simpson (who can't run), and Rudy Zolteck (who's overweight and quite [[flatulence|flatulent]]). After being ridiculed by the other players who made the team, she convinces her dad to coach a new pee-wee team of their own.  At first, Danny is reluctant to do so, but later accepts in an attempt to show Urbania that Kevin is not invincible, and that there is another O'Shea in town capable of winning. Kevin mockingly reminds him of the "one town, one team" rule and with the help of the locals, they decide to have a playoff game to determine the lone team that will represent Urbania. Among Becky, Hanon, Tad, Rudy, and Nubie (an intelligent boy who becomes assistant coach), Danny also gathers other children that have never been given a chance and dubs the team the "Little Giants." One such player is Junior Floyd ([[Devon Sawa]]), a strong-armed quarterback who turns out to be the son of Danny's childhood crush, Patty Floyd ([[Susanna Thompson]]). Becky slowly develops a crush on him and struggles with her newfound feelings as a girl.  Two old-timers, Orville ([[Harry Fleer]]) and Wilbur ([[Dabbs Greer]]), encourage the rivalry between Danny and Kevin by reporting to them that a new star player, Spike Hammersmith (Sam Horrigan), has just moved to Urbania. Danny succeeds at recruiting him by tricking his overzealous father, Mike ([[Brian Haley]]), that he is the famous "Coach O'Shea", but this is a problem as Spike proves to be rude, arrogant, and refuses to play on a team with a girl. The deception is later discovered and he switches over to Kevin's more well-structured team. Kevin also encourages his daughter, Debbie ([[Courtney Peldon]]), to be a cheerleader and later convinces Becky that a quarterback will want to date a cheerleader, not a teammate. Believing it is her best chance to win over Junior, she decides to quit the team and pursue cheerleading.  Just as Danny's team start to lose hope, a bus arrives carrying NFL stars [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]], [[Emmitt Smith]], [[Bruce Smith (defensive end)|Bruce Smith]], [[Tim Brown (American football)|Tim Brown]], and [[Steve Emtman]]. They teach and inspire the young players into believing they can win.  On the day of the game, Kevin chastises Danny into making an impulsive bet. If Danny wins, he gets Kevin's Chevrolet dealership; if Kevin wins, he gets Danny's gas station. Facing a 21-point halftime deficit, the Giants are lifted when Danny asks them to individually recall a time when they had a proud accomplishment and reassures them that all it takes is "one time" to beat the Cowboys. With this, they begin to make a big comeback with a series of outstanding and unexpected plays. Realizing that Junior is the main threat to them, Spike, under orders from Mike, injures him by spearing him with his helmet after the whistle, which even Kevin considers disgraceful, unsportsmanlike conduct. Witnessing from the sidelines, an enraged Becky drops her pompoms and suits up for the game. She immediately makes an impact when she forces a fumble after a jarring hit on Spike. Other Giants make touchdowns in tandem with overcoming personal problems, such as Hanon's fear of dropping passes and making a reception, or another one running towards the goal line when his little-seen dad has come to watch him play. In the game's closing seconds with the score tied at 21 all, the Giants make a goal line stand and stop Spike. With time remaining for one final play, their offense steps back onto the field and uses a trick play Nubie calls "[[Fumblerooski|The Annexation of Puerto Rico]]," inspired by one of Madden's plays at [[Super Bowl XI]]. Kevin shouts out its actual name as it occurs, shouting "Fumblerooski, Fumblerooski!" The play includes three different ball carriers, utilizing the [[hook and lateral]] from Zolteck, to Junior, and finally to Berman, who scores the Giants' 99 yard game-winning touchdown.  Afterwards, Danny says that rather than having the Giants solely represent Urbania, they should merge with the Cowboys, and both he and Kevin can coach the team. Danny and Patty rekindle their childhood romance. He also decides not to hold Kevin to the prior bet, on the condition that the town water tower be changed from "Home of Kevin O'Shea" to "Home of The O'Shea Brothers," reflecting a much earlier promise that Kevin made to Danny from their childhood.  
Little Big League
 Billy Heywood, the 12-year-old son of widowed Jenny, is a [[Little League Baseball]] player. Billy's paternal grandfather is Thomas Heywood, owner of the [[Minnesota Twins]].  The Twins are a last-place team, but Billy and his grandfather love each other, the Twins, and the game of baseball. When Thomas dies, his will reveals that he has given the team to Billy. Thomas specifies that, if Billy is still a minor at the time of his death, his aides are to help him until Billy is old enough to run the team by himself.  Billy quickly runs afoul of the team's manager, George O'Farrell. Billy believes O'Farrell is too hard on the players, while O'Farrell despises the idea of working for a kid. After O'Farrell insults Billy and tells him to butt out of the team's business, Billy fires him.  With no potential new managers willing to work for a kid, and with his grade-school summer break starting in two days, the baseball-savvy Billy decides to name himself the new manager. He reaches out to the [[Commissioner of Baseball]], who approves after consulting with Jenny.  The players are very skeptical, but Billy promises that if he does not improve the team's position in the standings within a few weeks, he will resign. The team quickly moves up to division race contention. Unfortunately, not all is going smoothly for Billy, as his friend and star [[first baseman]] Lou Collins takes a romantic interest in Jenny.  Billy picks up bad habits on the road, and is even ejected from a game and given a one-game "suspension" by his mother for throwing a temper tantrum and swearing at an [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] because of a call he didn't like. He also must release his personal favorite Twins player, Jerry Johnson, who is clearly in the twilight of his career. He ends up making Jerry feel even worse when Billy immaturely tries to illustrate his own distress by pointing out he owns Jerry's [[baseball card]] and wouldn't give it up for a [[Wade Boggs]] and a [[Sammy Sosa]].  The pressures of managing the team wear Billy down and consume his free time. Billy's friends do not like how his managerial responsibilities are keeping him away from being with them. Even when he's physically present (as opposed to on the road with the team), he is typically distracted by team business.  After Jenny spends her birthday with Lou rather than Billy, Billy uses Lou's minor batting-[[Slump (baseball)|slump]] as an excuse to bench him, sending the Twins into a losing skid. Billy later tells his mom that he's tired of being a "grown-up" and decides to quit as manager after the end of the season, even reinstating Lou to starter on first base.  With four games left in the season, the Twins trail the [[Seattle Mariners]] by four games in the [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] race. The Twins win their last four while the Mariners lose four straight, forcing a [[One-game playoff#Major League Baseball|one-game playoff]] at the Twins' [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] to determine who advances to the [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]].  The two teams trade three-run home runs during the course of the game, and [[extra innings]] are required. The Mariners eventually take the lead. Down to their final out, and Lou about to go up to bat, he tells Billy that he has asked Jenny to marry him, and that her reply was "Ask Billy". With a runner on base, Billy says if Lou hits the game-winning homer he will give his blessing, but quickly relents and gives Lou his consent whether or not he hits a homer. Facing [[Randy Johnson]], Lou hits a long fly ball to center field, but [[Ken Griffey Jr.]] makes a leaping catch at the wall to rob Lou of a homer and end the game.  With their season over, Billy tells the players he is officially stepping down as manager, with pitching coach Mac MacNally taking his place, as well as bringing back Jerry Johnson to be the third base coach and new hitting instructor. The players object to losing Billy, but he reminds the team that he will still be present as the owner, and says that he might come back as manager if junior high doesn't work out. When being informed that none of the fans have left, Billy, along with the rest of the team, returns to the field to receive a standing ovation.  
Lisbon Story (1994 film)
 ''Lisbon Story'' is partially a sequel to Wenders' 1982 film, ''[[The State of Things (film)|The State of Things]]''. The fictitious movie director in the previous film, Friedrich Munro, reappears, again played by [[Patrick Bauchau]]. In ''Lisbon Story'' Friedrich has moved to [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] (the country where ''The State of Things'' was set). The principal character, [[Philip Winter]] ([[Rüdiger Vogler]]), a sound engineer, receives a postcard invitation from Friedrich to come to Lisbon to record sounds of the capital city for his forthcoming film. On arriving, the director is nowhere to be found, though he leaves cryptic messages. This sets in motion a mysterious quest.   The sound engineer doesn't meet up with the director until the end of the movie, when it materialises that, disturbed by the commercialization of images, he had set out to capture what he terms the "unseen image" of the city, one devoid of the subjective view, while also pretending that the whole history of cinema had never happened. A semi-non-fictional aspect of the plot is the appearance of the internationally famous [[Portugal|Portuguese]] folk music group [[Madredeus]] and [[Manoel de Oliveira]], who at that time was the oldest living active film director in the world.  
A Low Down Dirty Shame
 Former LAPD detective Andre Shame is a private investigator who owns A Low Down Dirty Shame Investigations. He runs it with Peaches, whom he arrested six years before and has romantic feelings for him. Despite the high-risk jobs, Shame is unable to keep the firm afloat, and may be forced to close.  Five years earlier, Shame and a team of detectives went into Mexico to apprehend drug lord Ernesto Mendoza. Though Shame seemingly shot and killed Mendoza in a shoot-out, the other detectives were killed, with Shame and Sonny Rothmiller being the only survivors. This caused Shame to leave the force in disgrace.  In the present day, Rothmiller, who is now working for the DEA, tells him that Mendoza is still alive. He hires Shame to find the only witness who would testify against him...his ex-girlfriend Angela, who was caught in the middle of a love triangle with the two men. Angela escaped from the Witness Protection Program in New York and is in LA. Shame is hesitant at first, but seeing this as a chance to arrest the man who took everything from him, decides to take the case.  Shame gets information on one of Mendoza's lieutenants, Luis, Shame's former childhood acquaintance, then goes to a restaurant and has Luis warn Mendoza that Shame is coming for him.  Upon arriving home, Shame is attacked by Mendoza's henchmen and warned by a very much alive Mendoza to back away.  With the help of Peaches and her roommate Wayman, Shame tracks Angela to a posh hotel, and calls Sonny. Shame explains that he originally went to Mexico for her. She tells  Shame that she was going to testify against Mendoza, but Mendoza found her location, forcing her to flee. Shame discovers that Rothmiller is working for Mendoza, and the two barely escape Mendoza's thugs. Shame drops Angela at Peaches.  Shame cleans himself up, then abducts Luis and takes him to an abandoned building. When Luis refuses to give Shame Mendoza's whereabouts, Shame has him stumble into a meeting of white supremacists. With the supremacists chasing him, he gives Shame his boss's location in exchange for a ride. But Shame leaves him at their mercy.  At the club, Shame and Mendoza exchange words, then get into a Mexican standoff with Mendoza using his date as a hostage. When Wayman attempts to get Shame's attention, Mendoza uses the distraction to escape. Shame goes to Peaches to find Angela gone (she and Peaches had gotten into an argument earlier), and Capt. Nunez waiting for him. He has Nunez place Peaches in protective custody, and heads off to find Angela.  Shame meets Angela at a storage locker and discovers the real reason Mendoza wants her dead:  she stole $20 million of his money. At a motel, Shame receives a call from Mendoza informing him he has Peaches; and will exchange her for Angela and his money. The two agree to meet at a Mendoza owned-shopping mall. Angela tries to convince Shame to leave with her, but he is in love with Peaches, refuses and heads to the mall.  Before the exchange, Sonny admits he killed the other detectives because they wouldn't take Mendoza's bribe without Shame. He left Shame alive to take the blame. Peaches and Angela are placed on the escalator, and Mendoza discovers that Angela is a mannequin. With a gun hidden on the escalator Peaches begins shooting. Shame kills the mercenaries hired by Sonny, Luis is attacked by the dogs that were supposed trying to kill Shame, and Sonny is killed by Angela.  Mendoza captures Peaches, only to be confronted by Shame. After winning a fistfight, Shame arrests Mendoza, who is then killed by Angela. She attempts to kill Shame, but Peaches beats her in a fistfight.  Nunez threatens to arrest Shame, but Shame reminds Nunez that he helped take down a drug lord, find a federal witness and recover $15 million in stolen drug money. Shame keeps $5 million for expenses, with Peaches getting perks of a romantic relationship with Shame.

Love Burns
      
Love Affair (1994 film)
 Ex-football star Mike Gambril and singer Terry McKay, each of whom is engaged to marry someone else, meet on a flight to [[Sydney]]. The plane makes an emergency landing and passengers must wait until a piece of equipment is delivered.  Mike and Terry visit his elderly aunt Ginny on the isle of [[Moorea]]. They see each other with new eyes and fall in love. When they reach [[New York City]], they agree to reunite at the top of the [[Empire State Building]] in three months' time. Terry breaks up with her fiancé Ken Allen, as does Mike with his, Lynn Weaver.  Terry finds work as a singer, mostly in advertisements. Mike quits his job as a Los Angeles television sports announcer. He finds work as a coach at a small school and also returns to his true vocation as a painter. One of his pieces is of Terry in prayer from their idyllic day on the island.  Come their rendezvous, Terry, in her haste, is struck down by a car while crossing a street. Gravely injured, she is rushed to the hospital. Mike, waiting for her at the observation deck at the top of the building, is unaware of the accident. After many hours, he finally concedes at midnight that she has rejected him.  Now unable to walk, Terry refuses to contact Mike, wanting to conceal her disability. Instead, she finds a job as a music teacher. Six months after the accident, she sees Mike with his former fiancée at a holiday concert featuring [[Ray Charles]], which Terry is attending with her former boyfriend. Mike does not notice her condition because she is seated. Each can only manage a hello.  Christmas Eve arrives and Mike makes a surprise visit, claiming to have come across her address while looking up another name in a telephone directory. Although he steers the conversation to make her explain her actions, Terry merely dodges the subject, never leaving the couch on which she sits.  About to leave her life for good, Mike mentions the painting that he had done of her, which that very afternoon had been given away to a woman who admired it. He is about to point out that the woman was in a wheelchair when he suddenly pauses. Mike walks into Terry's bedroom and sees his painting hanging on the wall. He now knows why she did not keep their appointment. They embrace.  
Love on Delivery
 Ang Ho-Kam ([[Stephen Chow]]), a weak, disadvantaged but kind lunch delivery boy, happens to fall in love with Lily ([[Christy Chung]]), the girl of his dreams from a local sports center. However, his dream is crushed after a disastrous date with her, when the bully ''Judo'' master Black Bear, who also admires Lily, intervenes. That night, in a brutally straightforward fashion, Lily tells Ang that she dislikes weak and pathetic men.  After being further humiliated at the sports center by Black Bear, Ang seeks shelter at a convenience shop owned by Tat ([[Ng Man Tat]]), an eccentric handicap. Tat promises to teach Ang [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] to cure him of his weakness and cowardice, in exchange for money.  However, Tat, a self-professed ''[[Sanshou]]'' master, is merely a swindler taking advantage of Ang's gullibility, and teaches Ang useless, fantasy kung fu techniques.  But to Tat's surprise and annoyance, Ang is intent on being a full-time student. When Ang loses his job and runs out of money, he tells Tat he will follow him for life. Tat attempts to rid of him by persuading him to use a false technique called "The Invincible Wind and Fire Spin," a move that will almost certainly kill or at least seriously injure anyone – which involves holding onto the enemy and rolling down a huge flight of stairs, using the enemy to soften all the blows of the stairs. Ang is considering implementing the move, but decides against it. However, he becomes reassured of this so-called technique when he witnesses Tat himself falling down the stairs and surviving it, though that was an accident. Emboldened, Ang thanks Tat and leaves.  Determined to change Lily's views about him, Ang comes to Lily's rescue when Black Bear tries to force her to be his girl after Lily rejected him at the parking lot, wearing a [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] mask [[a'la]] superhero. After a scuffle, Ang manages to defeat Black Bear by using the "Spin." The next day, Ang tries to tell Lily that it was he who saved her, but before he can do it, Lily introduces her ex-schoolmate Master Lau, a [[karate]] champion from Japan who looks down on the weak.  To win Lily's heart, Lau lies to her that he is the "Garfield warrior" who saved her.  Infuriated for being called a garbage by Lau, Ang plans on challenging Lau to a combat match to prove his mettle. Upon seeing Tat at the garbage dump, he drags him along as punishment for lying to him and cheating him off his money.  However, upon arriving at the fitness center with a letter of challenge, Ang and Tat unexpectedly sees Lau in an office with five other people: a ''[[Taekwondo]]'' master, a [[boxing|boxer]], a ''[[Kenjutsu]]'' practitioner, Black Bear, and the Principal managing the fitness center. Since Lau is now in charge of the center, he wants karate, in his opinion the supreme martial art, to be the center's sole fighting discipline. Enraged, the four other elite [[martial arts|martial artists]] attack him, but Lau defeats them with ease.  Frightened, Ang is about to retract the challenge, but Lau manages to get the letter and reads it. Amused, he accepts, but the Principal insists on rescinding it. Nevertheless, Lau reveals a startling revelation: Tat is in fact a world-renowned martial arts champion and has defeated many in tournaments. However, Lau's [[sensei|master]] broke his leg in a match in Japan.  Tat has been living in obscurity ever since. To redeem himself, Tat promises to prepare Ang for the match against Lau, but only after receiving one month's training.  Lau also personally seeks to kill Ang. In a side bet made by Tat, if Ang can survive all three rounds, ''Sanshou'' will regain its public image at the center. An agreement is made.  The upcoming match receives much publicity and reporters follow Ang and Tat, wanting to see how a delivery boy can be transformed to a rival martial artist.  But, to everyone's amusement and puzzlement, Ang and Tat are only seen partying and eating. When asked, Tat replies that this is their training, unnerving some, even Lau.  A month passes, and the match arrives. Lily rushes to the stadium to cancel it, worrying for Ang's life. However, she and her friends are stranded in a malfunctioning elevator. At the boxing ring, Ang is voted the odds-on favourite to win by the judges because of his lack of fear, which ironically increases Lau's own trepidation. As the match commences with round one, Lau rushes in to attack, but stops abruptly when Ang simply turns around and keeps still. This is in fact Tat's strategy: to confuse Lau.  In the second round, Tat instructs Ang to wear down Lau with submissions and sucker punches; all the while, Tat deliberately distracts Lau by juggling things in the air. A commercial break ends round two.  Frustrated, Lau tries to end the match once and for all.  But Ang surprisingly grapples and locks him throughout the whole third round. In a flashback, Tat tells Ang that to prevent himself from losing the bet and his life, he must execute the "Golden Snake Restraint" defensive technique, hence the grapples and locks, which will prevent Lau from knocking him down. Visibly irate, Lau unsuccessfully tries to throw Ang off. Finally, round three ends, and Lau is announced the winner, though Ang wins the bet since he survives the match. Incensed, Lau starts ravaging the place, beating up even the referee and judges. To stop Lau, Ang decides to use the "Invincible Wind and Fire Spin" on him, using an immense [[lottery]] wheel as help.  The two spin wildly inside the wheel, and it explodes. Out of the rubble emerges Ang, exhausted but victorious, and Lau collapses in defeat. Lily, realising Ang is the "Garfield warrior," rushes over to kiss him, and Tat reintroduces ''Sanshou'' to the public.  
Madagascar (1994 film)
  ''Madagascar'' was originally conceived as the first part of a trilogy to be entitled 'Pronóstico del tiempo' ("Weather Prediction"). The production and post-production of director Fernando Pérez’s third fiction film was completed in September 1993 to await the preparation of the work’s other two parts: 'Melodrama' ("Melodrama," dir. [[Rolando Díaz]]) and 'Quiéreme y verás' ("Love me and you’ll see," dir. [[Daniel Díaz Torres]]). The three directors had worked together to develop their ideas for the creation of the project, but in the end, according to Pérez, the films wound up lacking the necessary continuity necessary to bind them together. Partly as a result of such concerns over their contents, and partly in response to the delays produced by an ongoing shortage of production funds for Díaz's and Díaz Torres' works, each wound up being released independently. During December 1994, over one year after the completion of its post-production, Madagascar first appeared in Cuba’s theatres as part of the annual [[New Latin American Film Festival]] held in [[Havana]].  ''Madagascar'' was inspired by the 1984 Mirta Yáñez short story "Beatles contra Duran Duran" ("Beatles Against Duran Duran"). The story chronicles the relationship between the narrator, who is a single mother and pragmatic middle-aged professor of physics, and her moody adolescent daughter. The plot of the film draws loosely from the original text, which Pérez appears to have used as a point of departure and a rough character sketch as he worked closely with cinematographer Raúl Pérez Ureta and screenwriter Manuel Antonio Rodríguez during the developmental stages of the project. Laura (played by Zaida Castellanos) and Laurita (played by Laura de la Uz) are the central characters of the film and bear an obvious resemblance to the unnamed narrator of the short story and her daughter, Pilar. However, the film’s mode of expression as well as its plot both diverge greatly from that of the story.  The main characters' opposing personalities form the focal points of the film’s narrative, which becomes a sort of psychological travelogue. During the opening sequence, we learn that Laura’s life has entered into a mysterious psychological crisis, exacerbated by her daughter’s extreme behavior. In an opening monologue, she tells us that she has lost the ability to dream anything different from what she experiences in her daily life. This monologue, and ostensibly the rest of Laura’s ongoing voice-over narration, occurs in the context of a consultation with an unseen doctor. From then on, the plot focuses around Laura’s internal conflicts and her relationship with her daughter. In an early scene, Laurita informs her mother that she has grown tired of school and will be taking a break from her studies in order to travel to Madagascar. In response, Laura becomes furious and criticizes Laurita for indulging in such frivolous fantasies. Increasingly disaffected, Laurita proceeds to undergo a series of personality transformations. This disturbs Laura, who is frustrated with the stagnant conditions of her own life, but cannot make such sudden changes.  Laura and Laurita live together with Laura’s elderly mother (Elena Bolaños), and are accompanied by a reticent young painter known only as Molina (Jorge Molina) who appears to have befriended Laurita. Throughout the film, the family moves often, changing homes four times. The film has the episodic quality of a road movie as much of the exposition thus takes place in the midst of the family’s relocations. The climax occurs when, following a particularly difficult argument with her mother, Laurita decides to run away from home. She returns after a few days, but the experience has altered both her and her mother. In the final scene, the two have practically traded personalities, and it is Laura who tells her daughter, "nos vamos de viaje para Madagascar" ("we’re going to travel to [[Madagascar]]").  The creators of the film bore the circumstances of its production admirably well. Prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, ICAIC had imported all of its film and development chemicals from the USSR and its economic allies. The lack of chemicals on the island after 1991 forced ''Madagascar''’s production unit to mail all of their negatives to a lab in Venezuela, making "dailies," or the practice of reviewing each day’s shooting and then re-filming whatever did not turn out as planned, impossible. Despite being forced to "shoot blind," as it were, Pérez maintains that he and his crew did not lack any truly fundamental supplies (besides gasoline, which was in scarce supply throughout the island by mid-1993). Nevertheless, the director did believe at the time that it would be his last film and such conditions may have played a significant role in the development of the film’s style and plot.  To date, ''Madagascar'' and the other pieces intended to make up "Pronóstico del tiempo" remain some of the last films to receive all of their production funds exclusively from el Instituto Cubano de Arte e Industria Cinematográficos ([[ICAIC]], the "Cuban Institute for the Film Art and Industry"). During the early 1990s, the Cuban economy had fallen on hard times and ICAIC’s budget suffered accordingly. By 1995, the small, semi-autonomous, national industry that had been producing independent works since 1959 had to restructure itself to meet the demands of the international market.

Lucky Break (1994 film)
   
The Madness of King George
 The film depicts the ordeal of King George III whose bout of madness in 1788 touched off the [[Regency Crisis of 1788]], triggering a power struggle between factions of [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] under the conservative [[William Pitt the Younger]] and the reform-minded [[Charles James Fox]].  At first, the King's habits appear mildly eccentric, and are purposely ignored for reasons of state.  The King is seen as being highly concerned with the wellbeing and productivity of England, and continually exhibits an encyclopedic knowledge of the families of even the most obscure royal appointments.  In fact, the King is growing more unsettled, largely over the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|loss of America]]. [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George]], his oldest son, aggravates the situation, knowing that he would be named regent in the event the King was found incapacitated.  George chafes under his father's repeated criticism, but also hopes for regency to allow him greater freedom to marry his Catholic mistress.  George also knows that he has the moral support of Charles Fox, who is eager to put across an agenda unlikely to pass under the current administration, including abolition of the slave trade and friendlier relations with America.  Knowing that the King’s behavior is exacerbated in public, the Prince arranges for a concert playing the music of [[Handel]].  The King reacts as expected, interrupting the musicians, acting inappropriately towards Lady Pembroke, attendant to the Queen, and finally assaulting his son.  The King's madness is treated using the relatively primitive medical practices of the time, which include blistering and purges, led on particularly by the Prince of Wales' personal physician, Dr. Warren. Eventually, Lady Pembroke recommends Dr Willis, an ex-minister who attempts to cure the insane through new procedures, and who begins his restoration of the King's mental state by enforcing a strict regime of strapping the King into a waistcoat and restraining him whenever he shows signs of his insanity or otherwise resists recovery.  Meanwhile, the opposition led by Charles James Fox, confronts Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger's increasingly unpopular government with a bill that would give the Prince powers of regency. Meanwhile, Baron Thurlow, the Lord Chancellor, discovers that the Prince was secretly and illegally married to his Catholic mistress. Thurlow pays the minister to keep his mouth shut, and himself tears out a record of the marriage from church rolls.  The King soon shows signs of recovery, becoming less eccentric and arrives in Parliament in time to thwart passage of the Regency bill. Restored, the King asserts control over his family, forcing the Prince to “put away” his mistress.  With the crisis averted, those who had been closest to the king are summarily dismissed from service, including Dr Willis.  During conversations with Pitt, the King appears more at ease and in control of himself.  He is less antagonized by America, but also shows signs that his insanity remains.

Major League II
 In the previous season, the [[Cleveland Indians]] won the division title by beating the [[New York Yankees]] in a one-game playoff, but were defeated in the [[American League Championship Series|ALCS]] by the [[Chicago White Sox]].  The success of last season has changed the attitudes of the Indians. Pitching sensation Rick "Wild Thing" Vaughn has become a media sensation and as such is now more concerned about his public image than his pitching, causing him to lose the edge on his fastball. Instead, he begins to rely on highly ineffective breaking balls, to which he gives nicknames such as "Eliminator" and "Humiliator." Home run hitter Pedro Cerrano becomes a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and adopts a more placid, carefree style as opposed to the angry and aggressive player he was before. Center fielder Willie Mays Hayes is still as fast as ever but like Vaughn is more concerned with his self image, as he comes into camp wearing flashy jewelry and showing off his newly found batting power (which is not much). Hayes also appeared in an action film that was a flop and resulted in him spraining his knee. Aging catcher and team leader Jake Taylor has also returned, but once again is dealing with injuries to his knees.  The team also has a major change at the very top. Rachel Phelps, the owner whose attempts to sabotage the team so she could move it to Miami were foiled, has sold the team to Roger Dorn, who has retired from his playing position to take the job. One of his first acts as owner is to sign [[Oakland Athletics]] all-star catcher Jack Parkman, which forces Jake to compete for his old position. Parkman is an arrogant player who does not respect the team. To further complicate things, minor-league catcher Rube Baker has also been invited to camp despite his inability to throw the ball back to the pitcher with any consistency.  As the team breaks camp, Taylor confronts manager Lou Brown as to his status. While he made the team, the other two catchers did as well and since Parkman won the competition to start, it does not make sense for both Taylor and Baker to be on the active roster. Lou tells him that he is keeping him on as a coach and not as a player, which upsets Jake but he gets over his anger and decides to take the position.  Once again, the Indians start slow. Cerrano's religious conversion causes him to struggle, as even the slightest mishap causes him to lose focus. Hayes, with his new prima donna attitude, refuses to play even with the slightest injury. Vaughn's control issues return and once again he gives up far too many runs. Furthering the issue is the incompetence of the owner, as Dorn is in over his head and has to resort to various methods to raise cash such as selling advertising space on the outfield walls.  Perhaps the biggest problem of all is the team's new star. Parkman quickly becomes a divisive figure in the clubhouse as his ego is out of control. Parkman is also unafraid to let his frustrations out in public and eventually, Lou reaches the end of his tolerance regarding Parkman and decides to suspend him after Parkman criticizes the team in the local papers. Parkman then informs Lou that the suspension is moot as he has been traded to the White Sox. Lou confronts Dorn for not consulting him about the trade. Dorn explains that he could no longer afford to pay Parkman's salary and had no choice but to trade him. In return, Japanese import Hiroshi "Kamikaze" Tanaka, a gifted left fielder with a penchant for crashing into the fence, is sent to the Indians.  Finally out of options, Dorn sells the Indians back to Rachel Phelps. Rachel keeps Dorn on as the Indians general manager and his first order of business is to re-activate himself as a player. Phelps bought the team back as revenge for ruining her plan to move the team to Miami. With the Indians now in last place, she has another chance to do so. Lou suffers a heart attack in the clubhouse due to his frustration over the team's performance and Jake is given the reins of the team.  Things come to a head during a doubleheader against the [[Boston Red Sox]]. When Rube is hit by a pitch in his ankle, Hayes is called upon to run for him but refuses to do it, which angers Jake. Vaughn quarrels with Hayes and the two begin fighting, which leads to the entire team fighting each other and getting ejected. After the game, Tanaka criticizes Cerrano for not having any "marbles" due to his struggles and Hayes makes a wisecrack at Baker about his injury, leading Rube to chastise Hayes and the rest of the team for their lack of passion and demand that he be inserted into the lineup for the second game of the doubleheader. Inspired by the speech, Hayes volunteers to run for the injured Baker in the bottom of the ninth inning of the second game and promptly steals second, third and home to tie the score. Cerrano, also inspired, demands that Jake insert him into the game to pinch hit and he responds by hitting the game-winning home run.  The win sparks a hot streak that the Indians ride all the way to a second straight division title, clinched by beating the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] on the last day of the season. Despite the team's hot streak, Vaughn continues to slump as his ineffective breaking pitches have caused him to lose confidence in his best pitch, his fastball. To make matters worse, he refuses to finish games he starts and has allowed the fans to get into his head.  In the ALCS, the Indians square off in a rematch with the White Sox and win the first three games of the series. This inspires Rachel to give the team a phony pep talk before Game 4, which is purposely designed to get in the heads of the players and distract them. It works, as a still struggling Vaughn gives up a game-winning home run to Parkman in the bottom of the ninth. The White Sox then defeat the Indians in the next two games, forcing a seventh game in Cleveland.  The night before the game, Jake goes to visit Vaughn at his home and tells him that he might be called on to pitch in relief in Game 7. Vaughn nonchalantly tells Taylor he will be ready, which infuriates Jake to the point where he lashes out at Vaughn. He calls Vaughn out for having lost his edge and strongly advises him to find it again before the upcoming game.  The White Sox jump out to an early 2–1 lead in Game 7 after Parkman bowls over Rube on a play at the plate, taunting him as he struggles to get up. With the Indians down by one, Hayes reaches base on a walk and taunts Parkman by saying he is going to score on the play without sliding. Rube then lines a drive to the left field corner and Hayes rounds the bases and heads for home. The ball gets to Parkman first, but Hayes, making good on his promise not to slide, hurdles over Parkman and lands on home plate. Parkman responds, however, by hitting a three-run home run in the seventh inning and the White Sox take a 5–3 lead into the bottom of the eighth.  Although the Indians get a runner on, two quick outs are recorded and Jake is forced to make a strategic move. To this point, despite multiple requests, he has not used Dorn in a game since he came back. Jake finally decides to use him to "take one for the team" and sends him up to pinch hit. Dorn takes the first pitch off his lower back and is pulled for a pinch runner.  Cerrano steps in, having apparently reverted to his more placid self. He greets Parkman, who reminds him that his team is still losing the game. After taking two pitches, Cerrano's teammates begin shaking little bags of marbles at him. With this, the Cuban slugger is able to find his focus and send the next pitch over the fence to give the Indians a 6–5 lead.  However, the go-ahead runs reach base with two outs in the top of the ninth. Jake calls on Vaughn to get the final out and to everyone's amazement, Vaughn has taken Jake's message to heart and rediscovered his edge. To further this, he tells Jake that he intends to walk the current batter and pitch to Parkman instead, who is on deck. Knowing that an intentional walk will load the bases, Jake initially balks but takes confidence in Vaughn and allows him to face Parkman.  Vaughn throws a fastball that Parkman swings through for strike one, then follows with another fastball that Parkman fouls straight back. With two strikes on him, an impressed Parkman dares Vaughn to throw it a third time. Vaughn fearlessly complies with one more fastball that Parkman swings through, striking out to end the game and send the Indians to the World Series.

Victor proceeds to tell Walton and the crew his life story.  Victor grows up in [[Geneva]] with his adopted sister, [[Elizabeth Lavenza]], who will become the love of his life. Before he leaves for the university at [[Ingolstadt]], Victor's mother dies giving birth to his brother William. Traumatized by grief afterward, Victor vows on his mother's grave that he will find a way to conquer death. However, he is shunned by his peers, who view him as a madman. Eventually, he and his friend Henry Clerval meet [[Doctor Waldman|Waldman]], a professor whose notes contain information on how to create life; Waldman warns Victor not to use them lest he create an "abomination".  While performing vaccinations, Waldman is murdered by a patient, who is later hanged in the village square. Using the body, a leg from a corpse, and Waldman's brain, Victor builds a creature based on the professor's notes. He is so obsessed with his work that he drives Elizabeth away when she comes to visit him. Victor finally gives his creation life, but instantly regrets his decision and tries to kill it with an axe; the creature steals his coat and is driven away by the townspeople when it tries to steal food.  The creature escapes, running off to the wilderness.

But when the blind man's family returns, they attack the creature and abandon their farm. The creature finds Victor's journal in his coat, learning of the circumstances of his creation. He burns down the farm and vows revenge on his creator.  Victor, who believes the creature to be dead, returns to Geneva to marry Elizabeth. He finds his younger brother William has been murdered.

The two are briefly and happily reunited until the creature appears, demanding Elizabeth as his bride.

However, Tilton tells Kellaway to release Stanley, believing that Tyrell was the Mask the whole time and Stanley only put it on this once.

To avoid getting involved with the police again, Stanley decides to return the mask back to the harbor. Tina throws the mask into the water, and she and Stanley kiss.

Afterwards, Nick and his crew go to the island, which they find is occupied by peaceful natives—natives who the mercenaries are supposed to convince to abandon the island. Nick respects them, but there is friction caused by a few mercenaries who want to kill natives to persuade them to leave, or, alternatively, to get them to divulge where a suspected treasure might be. Nick stops them and finds out the "treasure" they are after is guano (which does have value in sufficient quantities). The two men paying the mercenaries intend to [[Surface mining|strip mine]] the island to get it, leaving the natives and their homes as casualties. The group divides up, with half wishing to finish the job for which they were paid, and the other half, led by Nick, wishing to protect the islanders. Nick hands the former group their pay and orders them to leave the island as he refuses to kill the natives to do the job.  Meanwhile, Keefer and the Colonel, who suspect there is money to be made, join the group Nick kicked out. They then storm the island with many new mercenaries, hoping to force off or exterminate Nick, his soldiers, and the natives. Many of the invaders are shot, stabbed, blown up, and worse in the ensuing battle. Though poorly armed, the natives make up for this in trickery and local knowledge.

After a number of attacks by both sides, many are dead and there is a final showdown between Nick and Keefer; Keefer gains the upper hand in the fist fight and attempts to strangle Nick to death while drowning him.

She releases a magic pearl from her stomach, which she uses to revive a still unconscious Chi. She is interrupted when people approach and flees in a panic. Chi accidentally swallows the pearl and wakes up, thinking that he was merely swept to shore by the water. The mermaid attempts to swim home, but discovers that she can't without her pearl.

After a dinner date together eating clams, Siu-may gets the chance, but she is so caught up with her new feelings for Chi that she forgets to summon the pearl. On Chi's birthday, he confesses that he has feelings for her, and Siu-may protests that he can't, because she is a "fish". Siu-may stands under the rain and allows herself to transform into her mermaid shape. Chi falls down in shock, and at that moment Miss Yuen and her colleagues run in and capture Siu-may, carrying her away.  Chi, Kenji and Kiki work together to rescue Siu-may where she is being imprisoned in the principal's swimming pool. They are successful, and they return to the docks the next morning. Siu-may has her pearl now and can return home. Chi and Siu-may declare their love for each other, and Chi adds that he'll wait for her. Siu-may jumps into the sea, transforms and swims away.  Afterward, Miss Yuen, the principal and the rest of their group follow Chi around in the hopes of finding Siu-may again. One day Chi  bumps into a bridesmaid at a wedding, who looks identical to Siu-may. The principal takes a hose from a nearby gardener and starts spraying the new girl, but she doesn't transform into a mermaid, much to their confusion.

A Million to Juan
  A Million to Juan is a 1994 romantic comedy film starring comedian Paul Rodriguez. It was also his directorial debut. The story is a modern spin on Mark Twain's story "The Million Pound Bank Note".  The story begins with a narration by Alejandro Lopez as he retells the events of his father's life, Juan Lopez (Paul Rodriguez), and how by selling oranges he changed their lives.  Juan was born on a strawberry field in Bakersfield, California, but due to hardship, his mother decided to relocate to Mexico. Now Juan is an undocumented citizen, due to no proof of US citizenship, of Los Angeles, struggling not only to get a green card, but to solely care for Alejandro, after his wife's death.  Yet, he has no documentation to attest to his U.S. citizenship and lives as an undocumented worker in Los Angeles selling oranges near the freeway. He lives with two roommates and tries to make ends meet so he can take care of his little son. He loves to cook and feed them gourmet meals (secret plot hint) each day as he tries desperately to make ends meet so he can take care of his little son. He is stressed as he battles landlords and immigration.    One afternoon, a stranger (Edward James Olmos) in a fancy limousine finds Juan, on the street corner, broke, almost homeless, with a child to care for and with only the hope of a shopping cart with oranges to keep him from utter homelessness.  The very wealthy stranger clearly understands the situation, pulls up quietly and hands to Juan a check in the amount of $1,000,000.00, but under the condition, that he MUST give back all the money in one month. Juan is suspicious and takes the check to his immigration worker (Polly Draper) who encourages him to follow the directions given him, but first, he is encouraged by his brothers to use the check to get credit extended to them at several posh Hollywood clothing stores, an exotic car dealership, and more.  Juan comes to learn, his son's social worker (Polly Draper), is a woman in a difficult and likely "dead-end relationship with a bossy businessman who cares little if nothing about her and the lives of the poor, unfortunately in this instance, the less educated Hispanics living and working, doing unskilled work in Metro Los Angeles. Then the fun begins for good-natured Juan Lopez, who has to avoid temptations and the greedy people that who have suddenly popped-up in his life suddenly, but are soon to be part of this brief and fleeting life as a "once upon a time moment as a virtual one month millionaire."  Juan begins to realize, money is not everything in one's life despite some very valuable materials things that can come, go, be given, and even taken away. He begins to realize, that the true meaning of life is truly love, family, and happiness, and that money alone isn't the answer.  Unfortunately, the millionaire experience begins to wane, ending with an embarrassing but necessary repossession of the luxury sport car, removal of the tremendous wardrobe of Italian and very posh suits, and clothing. Finally, Juan and his brothers are seen shortly thereafter, garbed in their plain and ordinary street clothes; the only thing left are the clothes on their backs. The final scene reveals a now sad and very depressed Juan, that he had been returned to the streets and his true love for his lady friend; his love interest, rejected him in favor of the practical but unhappy relationship with the smug, arrogant, but very wealthy businessman boyfriend.  Juan reluctantly accepts - he has absolutely nothing to offer but this true love for the woman who he loved.  Juan is later seen -  "once again" on the Los Angeles street corner near the highway onramp off ramps, selling plastic bags of oranges from a small shopping cart. The Stranger is seen in the long white limo. He reappears, rolls down the dark tinted window, and hands Juan another envelope which contains a piece of paper with a simple address in Central Los Angeles. The stranger tells Juan to go there. Juan, depressed and grieving, tells the Stranger his earlier efforts brought only unhappiness and disappointment to this life. The Stranger assures him, that it's up to Juan to take a chance in life despite his feelings, that to try and to care in life is hopeless...  Later that afternoon, a convertible routinely drives up and stops near Juan. A lady says quietly, but with a big smile: "Oranges, "Por Favor." The movie ends with the promise and hope of a complete and fulfilling future for Juan, his son, brothers, and a few more. Bon Suerte, Juan can be heard at the end of this wonderful story of hope, love, and opportunity.

Mixed Nuts
 The plot begins on Christmas Eve, with ex-con Felix running from his angry, pregnant wife, Gracie, as she chases him down the road. He accidentally runs into and damages a Christmas tree carried by two rollerbladers. When an argument breaks out among them, a stranger, Philip, unsuccessfully attempts to calm them down. They soon disperse.  Philip, head of the suicide-prevention hotline "Lifesavers", receives an eviction notice from his landlord, Stanley, after being unable to pay the organization's rent for several months. In addition to him, the hotline is staffed by the selfish, neurotic, and rather fearful office manager, Mrs. Blanche Munchnik and the overly emotional and empathetic supervisor Catherine O Saughnessy. Philip, who does not inform his coworkers of the eviction, attempts to convince his girlfriend, Susan, who is a loan officer in a local bank, to grant him a small loan. She refuses the loan before telling him that she has been secretly dating a psychiatrist for four months and is breaking up with him.  Despite Catherine's expectation that "you'd expect everyone to be thinking of jumping out of windows or slitting their wrists on Christmas Eve", the staff has received few calls. There is one phone call from a woman who is frightened by a notorious Los Angeles [[serial killer]] dubbed "the Seaside Strangler," and another from Chris, a transgender woman, who convinces Philip to disclose Lifesavers' office address. Meanwhile, an elevator malfunction leaves Mrs. Munchnik trapped on her way to Christmas Eve dinner. Philip eventually manages to pull her to the top of the elevator when Gracie arrives and attempts to operate it. They are terrified that they will be crushed by the ceiling of the elevator shaft, but eventually they all manage to return to the office.  Felix arrives, begging Gracie to listen to him, and she throws a fruitcake at him, causing a large cut on his forehead. Philip and Catherine take him to a veterinarian to be treated for his head wound. While the doctor is distracted, he steals and quickly overdoses on dog tranquilizers and is taken to a hospital. Meanwhile, at the office, the doorbell rings. Gracie quickly throws the door open, accidentally striking Mrs. Munchnik and revealing Chris in the doorway. Gracie leaves Chris to care for the unconscious Mrs. Munchnik. When Philip returns, Chris is sitting on the sofa and convinces him to dance with her. When Mrs. Munchnik revives, she witnesses the dancing and threatens to sue Philip for withholding information of the eviction and for "inappropriate office behavior" before leaving.  Felix arrives at the office brandishing a gun, having escaped from the hospital. Chris gets shot in the foot after attempting to disarm him. Gracie takes the gun and shoots wildly around the office to empty it of ammunition. Two shots go through the front door, killing Stanley, who was standing behind it with a bag of his possessions. The sight of the dead Stanley puts Catherine in shock. Philip prepares a bath to calm her down, realizes that he is strongly attracted to her, and they have sex. Meanwhile, Chris takes a mutual romantic interest in Louie Capshaw - an eccentric resident in the building, who sings impromptu songs on his prized ukelele. Gracie and Felix disguise Stanley's body as a Christmas tree, and the decision is made to take it and the bag to the boardwalk and leave it there.  As they all carry Stanley's body down the street, they encounter the now-vengeful rollerbladers, who barrel through them. Felix tosses the tree and it crashes to the ground, revealing Stanley's body. When the police arrive, Philip falsely confesses to the killing, but Gracie pulls out the gun as proof of her guilt. Felix grabs it and runs to the roof of a nearby building, where he threatens to commit suicide. Philip soon convinces him to climb down, to much applause. Catherine hands Stanley's bag to the detectives, who search it. They find fishing line and kelp, the weapons of choice for the Seaside Strangler. Stanley was the Seaside Strangler all along.   For killing the criminal, Gracie receives the reward of $250,000. She offers to pay for Lifesavers' moving expenses, then promptly goes into labor. She gives birth in the first few hours of Christmas Day in a scene that resembles the [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]]. Philip then asks Catherine to marry him.

Miracle on 34th Street (1994 film)
 Cole's Department Store's special events director Dorey Walker ([[Elizabeth Perkins]]) fires Tony Falacchi from being the Cole's Department Store's [[Santa Claus]] after he gets [[alcohol intoxication|drunk]] before taking part in the [[Thanksgiving]] parade. Immediately trying to find a replacement, she spots an elderly man ([[Richard Attenborough]]) who was berating the inebriated Santa before the parade. When Dorey begs him to take over, he introduces himself as Kris Kringle. Kris does so well during the parade that he is immediately hired to be Cole's main Santa for the holiday period. All the children in New York begin to believe that he is the real Santa, with the exception of Dorey's six-year-old daughter Susan ([[Mara Wilson]]). Dorey's boyfriend, Bryan Bedford ([[Dylan McDermott]]), does his best to convince Susan to believe. While being babysat one night by Kris, Susan shares with him her Christmas wish, she would like a dad, a house (used every year for the Cole's catalogue photoshoot) and a baby brother. Kris asks if she would begin to believe in Santa if she got all those things. Susan agrees that she would.  Kris is credited with bringing in increasingly more sales to Cole's than previous years. One night, he is arrested for assaulting a man on the street, later revealed to be the original drunk Santa, Tony Falacchi. Falacchi had taken revenge by means of setting up Kris to be arrested, with the help of members of staff from a rival department store of Cole's, Shopper's Express. With the help of Bryan, Dorey takes Kris's case to court, and drums up support for him from the public. It soon becomes clear that to get Kris acquitted and freed, Bryan must somehow prove that not only does Santa exist, but that Kris is the real one. It is a seemingly impossible task until Bryan comes up with a plan that requires some help from Susan.  Just as the judge is about to make his decision – and it seems he was going to rule against Kris – Susan walks up to the judge with a Christmas card containing a $1 bill. On the back, the words [[In God We Trust]] are circled. The judge realizes that, since the U.S. Department of Treasury can put its official faith in God with no hard evidence, then the people of New York can believe in Santa Claus in the same way. Left with no choice, the elated judge dismisses the case and declares that Santa is real, existing in the person of Kris Kringle.  Following the court case, Dorey and Bryan are maneuvered by Kris into realizing their true feelings for each other, and are married in a very small ceremony right after the Christmas Eve Midnight Mass. On Christmas morning, Susan wakes to the news of the marriage and is elated to see that she has part one of her Christmas wish, Bryan as her new dad. Together, Susan, Dorey and Bryan drive out to the catalogue house and upon arrival, find that Kris has arranged for them to purchase the house, which they can now afford due to the size of the Christmas bonus Dorey has received as a result of Kris' work at Cole's. Susan, now having got two out of three of her wishes, excitedly runs upstairs in the house to look at her bedroom. Dorey and Bryan are about to kiss when Dorey ask her what the last part of her Christmas wish was, and she triumphantly announces that it was a baby brother. Dorey and Bryan both look at each other, shocked, before glancing down at Dorey's stomach and sharing a kiss. The film ends with the belief that Susan has now received all she asked for in her wish. It is mentioned that Kris has gone overseas.

Eventually the chase gets less frantic and the monk and the fish move in harmony. They float through a door into the open space and drift off into the sky together.

However, Azro has personally taught Fingers how to pickpocket the audience members, unbeknownst to them in a very stealth like manner. A pair of Italian mafia members named Drake (Robert Miranda) and Charlie (Victor Argo) show up to Azro's act one day. They quickly deduce Azro's scheme, and proposition him to bigger and better opportunities. They ask him to join their crime syndicate, with Fingers using his pickpocket skills, to burglarize homes of socialites, as Fingers also knows how to burglarize buildings. The men first want to do a test run to see how Fingers will act, and the men drive to a random residence. Coincidentally being Eva's home. Fingers successfully steals various expensive items, and Azro joins the crime group. Due to feeling ashamed of his actions, later that night Fingers runs away from Azro.   The next day, as Eva is walking home from school, Fingers drops from a tree and latches himself onto Eva. She instantly becomes connected to him, and names him "Dodger", as he likes Eva's baseball cap which is labeled after the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|same named team]]. Eva due to obvious reasons, keeps the monkey a secret, and she hides him in her bedroom. She does a remarkably well job with this. After obtaining Dodger, Eva becomes more responsible with her chores, and helps take care of her infant brother Jack, whom she reveals Dodger to. She also researches information on the breed Dodger is. When Eva has to leave for school, she leaves him in the care of a woman who runs a pet shop near her home, Annie (Jo Champa). Eva fibs that the monkey is a present for her mother. Azro during this time, tries to find the monkey with the Italian mafia members pestering him over this.   As Eva spends certain weekends with her father, one arrives. She begins to panic as to how she can hide Dodger while she's away. However, Peter leaves a phone message that he's in Canada and can't have her over. She takes advantage of this circumstance to have a personal weekend alone with Dodger in her father's empty house, and hides his message from her mother and stepfather, and has her best friend Katie (Remy Ryan) and her mother Missy (Deborah White) drive her over to her father's house on the other side of town. During the trip, Eva secretly reveals Dodger to Katie. Once there, Eva forgot that she doesn't have a key to her fathers door. Dodger is quickly able to break into the home. Once inside, they realize that there isn't any food and Eva did not bring any money with her. She quickly decides to busk money at Venice Beach boardwalk nearby Peter's house, with Dodger. While Eva is riding in her bike to the boardwalk, Dodger and Azro spot each other, and without Eva being aware, Dodger jumps off her bike. Azro tries to catch Dodger, but he is caught by the mafia members who take him away from the scene. Dodger then secretly makes his way back to Eva's bike, and they start their performance with Dodger (who is secretly pick-pocketing everybody just as with when he was with Azro).   At a grocery store that evening, with Dodger hiding in Eva's backpack, he steals and hides food without Eva knowing. The management of the store unaware there is a monkey in her backpack, assume Eva is shoplifting and allow her to return the items without being punished. Eva who is puzzled, opens her backpack in a back aisle of the store, and notices the items Dodger stole in shock. When she returns home, she scolds him. Dodger then fesses up and reveals all the items he has stolen since he came into contact with Eva. Eva then starts to realize that he was taught how to pickpocket, and how to break into buildings. She then decides for the rest of the weekend, to teach him not to steal anymore.  Azro, from word of mouth from civilians in the area, finds out about the supermarket incident, and a manager at the store who knows Eva and her father, gives him Peter's address. Eva who gave a successful intervention towards Dodger, is now preparing to return home and calls a taxi cab. Azro arrives at the house, and Eva is immediately scared of him. She and Dodger run out the house, and escape from him. The next day however, Azro again from word of mouth finds out Dodger is at Annie's pet shop. Azro attacks Annie and steals Dodger back, upsetting Eva who is told this by the manager of the laundromat next door filling in for Annie who went to the police station. Azro is aghast when he discovers that the monkey won't steal anymore, during a meeting with the mafia members. Meanwhile, Amy and Tom, who has been dealing with reports on stolen jewelry, discover more stolen property in Eva's room. They confront her about it, and she tries to explain about her hidden monkey, but they refuse to believe her. Things get worse when Peter stops by and reveals that he had been in Canada all weekend, which reveals that Eva had lied about that time. She, already heartbroken at the disappearance of her beloved pet, is additionally upset that no one will believe her, and so she runs away to look for Dodger after Katie calls and informs Eva that Dodger is at the park. She is accosted by Azro, who is furious about her teaching Dodger not to steal. Meanwhile, Jack ends up saying his first word, "monkey", revealing to Amy, Peter, and Tom that there really is a monkey in the house (Dodger escaped from Azro again, shortly after Eva ran off and sneaked back into her bedroom) and that Eva had been telling them the truth. They all go out, along with Tom's fellow police officers, to look for her. Dodger saves her, and Azro is arrested by Tom, with the mafia members quickly escaping. Eva walks away happily with Dodger after she shows her mother that she is responsible and her stepfather discovers that he is not allergic to the fur of monkeys. However Mark tries taking Dodger back, but fails. Dodger ends up staying with Eva. Eva brings Dodger and her brother Jack to school one day, explaining all the events to her classmates.

She is then contacted by psychotherapist Dr. Brian Allen, who invites her to visit one of his sessions. Little does Nora know, that Brian is a fanatical member of a [[religious cult]], and is a fraud who wants to indoctrinate Nora.  As Nora visits more of Brian's sessions, her pain starts to disappear. She is able to find her joy in life again, and loosens up by buying Kim a car for her birthday. She quickly becomes infatuated with her therapist and even has daydreams about him.

Papa tells Andy and Randy that they are strong smart boys who can take care of themselves, but they need to look after their sister Sandy. While the two dumb brothers build flimsy homes of straw and sticks, Sandy constructs a state-of-the-art brick house. At night, The [[Big Bad Wolf]] comes and blows down Andy and Randy's houses. The siblings turn to Sandy for shelter, and she only lets them stay if they promise to show her some respect. The Big Bad Wolf returned the next day demanding that Sandy lets him in and reminds the pigs that they are supposed to say "Not By the Hair of My Chinny Chin Chin." Sandy opens up the door and karate chops the Big Bad Wolf when she accuses him of his claim that Sandy has facial hair. The Big Bad Wolf then starts to blow Sandy's house down which has no effect. Then the Big Bad Wolf disguises himself as the [[pizza]] delivery man only for Sandy to take the pizza. The Big Bad Wolf's latest plan involves dressing up as [[Santa Claus]] and going down the chimney. Andy and Randy almost fall for this until Sandy reminds them that it's the middle of summer. When Andy and Randy think that Santa Claus came early, Sandy ends up lighting a large firecracker in the chimney which launches the Big Bad Wolf into the sky.  ===[[Midas|King Midas]]=== King Midas (played by [[Kermit the Frog]]) spares the life of a [[Satyr]] (played by [[Gonzo the Great]]) that was sleeping in his garden after the Satyr offers to grant King Midas a wish.

When King Midas accidentally turns himself to gold upon reacting to his food being turned to gold, Queen Midas tries various attempts to get him back to normal. The Satyr tells Queen Midas that the effects of the Golden Touch can be undone if Queen Midas renounces her interest in gold. The Satyr then offers to give King Midas and Queen Midas another wish for free. While King Midas still wanted world peace, Queen Midas wanted a Slice-O-Matic in green. Rizzo the Rat narrated that King Midas, Queen Midas, and the Satyr used the Slice-O-Matic to throw fabulous dinner parties for everyone in the kingdom.  ===[[The Boy Who Cried Wolf]]=== The repeated overreactions of a young [[shepherd]] (played by Gonzo) cause the villagers and their [[mayor]] (played by Kermit) to doubt his word when he has made claims of sensing [[earthquake]]s and [[tsunami]]s. When the [[Gray wolf|wolf]] shows up and challenges the shepherd to obtain help within 24 hours before he eats his [[sheep]], the shepherd goes through every attempts to prove that the wolf is threatening the sheep. After all attempts have failed, the sheep state that the shepherd learned his lesson and protested to end the story before the wolf arrives. Rizzo the Rat narrates that the story is not over yet despite the protests of the sheep and that the wolf would return in one hour. One of the rams mentions to the shepherd and his fellow sheep about his cousin Norman and they come up with a plan. When the wolf arrives, the shepherd stated that the wolf was right about the drop in his credibility as his final quote to him is "big sheep." The wolf ends up being surprised by the arrival of a large ram named Norman who ends up crushing the wolf. The wolf briefly gets up by quoting "That's what you mean about really big sheep" and ends up crushed again. The shepherd and the sheep then chant Norman's name.

The King also tells his Loyal Royal Advisor that he will be given his own castle if he succeeds. All the fairest maidens in the land were brought to the King's castle so that one of them can become queen. Wanting the attention of the King, a [[miller]] (played by Papa Pig) claims to the Loyal Royal Advisor that his daughter Piggy can spin straw into gold when he brings her to the King's Castle. Piggy is placed in a room full of straw where the Loyal Royal Advisor (who still wants to fulfill getting his own castle from the King) orders her to demonstrate her gift that her father claims that she has or else she will be spending the rest of her life in the dungeon. She ends up receiving the assistance of Rumpelstiltskin (played by Gonzo) who spins the straw into gold upon Piggy giving him her necklace. The next morning, the Loyal Royal Advisor discovers the golden straw and states that he'll keep an eye on the gold that is present while Piggy spins the second batch of straw into gold.

The next morning, the King and the Loyal Royal Advisor came in and found the golden straw. The King married Piggy and the Loyal Royal Advisor got his own castle. When Queen Piggy finally had her child, Rumpelstiltskin came in and states that he will let her keep her child if he can guess his name. If she can't guess his name by tomorrow, then the child will end up in the possession of Rumpelstiltskin. Piggy called the King, the Loyal Royal Advisor, and her father where she told them the whole truth about her having help in converting straw into gold. The King mentioned that he married Piggy because he loved her which surprised the Loyal Royal Advisor and her father. The four of them get to work at guessing Rumpelstiltskin's name. When the deadline is up, Rumpelstiltskin returns to see if Piggy has guessed his name and nearly gave it away.

Rumpelstiltskin declares it an outrage while Piggy, the King, the Loyal Royal Advisor, and the Miller celebrate.  ===[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]=== In the kingdom of Fozzalia, three rat tricksters (played by [[Rizzo the Rat]], [[List of Muppets#Additional characters|Yolanda the Rat]], and Montague the Rat) are in the town square showing off their Curative Elixirs. [[Robin the Frog]] doubts Rizzo's claim while another man stated that the Curative Elixir "cured his baldness" as a rat is seen on top of his head. The young boy states that the rat is on the man's head which the man notices. The rat jumps off the man's head as the rat tells Rizzo that the jig is up. Rizzo is arrested by the [[Chief of police|Police Chief]] (played by Officer Fuzzy from ''[[Dog City]]'') and is taken to [[Emperor]] [[Fozzie Bear]]. Upon being brought to Emperor Fozzie, Rizzo claims to him that the rest of his wardrobe is shabby due to it not being special enough. Rizzo states that he happens to be the finest [[tailor]] in all the land.

Members of the Emperor's Court claim to not see it until they do after the Emperor claims that they aren't "elegant enough." The rats then present Fozzie with his "new clothes" that are on the hanger that Rizzo gives him. Before Rizzo can lead Yolanda and Montague to their next business in Tarzana, Emperor Fozzie states that he will hold a celebration to show off his new clothes with the rats being his guests of honor. At the celebration, Rizzo gives the crowd a heads up stating that Emperor Fozzie's new clothes can only be seen by the elegant. When Emperor Fozzie goes out to show his new clothes, Robin notices that Emperor Fozzie is wearing nothing but his boxers. Emperor Fozzie notices this as the members of his Court end up using their bodies to cover him. The citizens of Fozzalia think that since Emperor Fozzie isn't wearing clothing and that public nudity must be the latest fad Emperor Fozzie tells his people that they should stop doing things just because he does them, and that they should start thinking for themselves. As Rizzo, Yolanda, and Montague try to take their leave, they are caught by the Police Chief. Gonzo narrates that the Emperor and his kingdom learned that it's best to think for themselves and follow their own fashion. As for Rizzo, Yolanda, and Montague, they lived happily ever after, while serving 10 years in the palace dungeon. When Rizzo states that they should visit a [[Sultan]] who is so gullible when they get out, Yolanda and Montague end up kicking Rizzo.  ===[[The Elves and the Shoemaker]]=== A [[Shoemaking|shoemaker]] (played by Kermit) and his nephew [[Robin the Frog]] are visited by the local banker (played by Officer Fuzzy from ''[[Dog City]]'') who demands his money by tomorrow or he will toss them into the street. The shoemaker states that they haven't been having good business lately since they've been making ugly shoes and all will be lost if there is nothing else to do about it. When the shoemaker and his nephew Robin go to sleep, their house is visited by a group of philanthropic entertainer [[Elf|elves]] (played by The Elvises). Unfortunately, they can only make blue suede shoes. The next morning, the shoemaker and Robin woke up to find the blue suede shoes and a bunch of customers outside of their store. By the time night had fallen, every shoe in the shop has been sold and the banker takes the money stating that he'll be back tomorrow for the other half of "his money." When Robin hopes for another miracle that involves whoever helped them to return, the shoemaker states that they will be ready to find out who has been helping them. Once the shoemaker and his nephew have fallen asleep, they awoke in time to see the elves working on the blue suede shoes. When morning comes, the store is packed with eager customers and the banker takes the other half of the money. Upon watching the elves at work, the shoemaker tells Robin that it's time he thanked them for their kindness. Rizzo ends up coming on stage to suggest a gift to give to the elves. The shoemaker and Robin worked through the night to make a special gift to thank the elves. When the elves arrived at midnight, the shoemaker and Robin present them with white sequined jumpsuits. While the shoemaker and Robin live happily ever after, the elves relocated to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] where they perform two shows.  '''Note''': During this story, Rizzo walks onstage to speak to Kermit and Robin about a gift to give the Elvises. As [[Steve Whitmire]] was already performing Kermit, he could not puppeteer for Rizzo at the same time and Rizzo's voice is recognizably that of [[Dave Goelz]].  ===Finale=== As Gonzo and Rizzo close out the show while dancing with Kermit and Robin, the Elvises sing "Blue Suede Shoes" during the credits.

Meanwhile, Muriel's "friends" plan a holiday to Hibiscus Island without her.  While out to dinner, Muriel and her family run into Bill's rumored mistress, Deidre Chambers, who has done well in a cosmetics pyramid scheme, and she recruits Muriel.

She leaves and wishes him good luck in the Olympics.  Bill asks Muriel to stay and help raise her siblings; she refuses. She repays $5,000 (the money she was paid for marrying David) of the $12,000 she stole, saying that she will repay the rest when she gets a job back in Sydney.

She has matured from the spunky, eleven-year-old hypochondriac to a lively, yet more serious teenager seeking independence. Her father Harry and his new wife Shelly DeVoto, whom he dated in the first film, are expecting a baby. They still live in the Sultenfuss funeral home in [[Madison, Pennsylvania]], while Harry's brother Phil has moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he works as a mechanic. Gramoo, Vada's grandmother, is no longer alive. Vada still has her mood ring from two years earlier and wears it in memory of her late best friend Thomas J., who died retrieving it for her after she had lost it.   To accommodate the new baby, Vada moves out of her bedroom and into Gramoo's old room, which has been renovated, and it brings further problems with adjustment. Vada even thinks about getting her own apartment while spending a night out with her father.  Vada is given a school assignment to write an essay on someone she admires but has never met. She decides to write about her mother but has few sources to go on, which are all confined to a small box. Among its contents are programs of plays her mother was in (she was an aspiring actress), a passport, and a mystery paper bag with a date scribbled on it. Vada expresses her desire to travel someday, so  Shelly concocts a plan for her to travel to Los Angeles during her spring break, where she can stay with her uncle Phil and do research on her mother, who lived in L.A. growing up. Harry initially does not go along with the idea, believing Vada is too young to be traveling by herself, and fearing what might happen to her in California. Eventually, he lets her take the five-day trip.  Upon arriving in L.A., Vada finds herself confronting a boy her age named Nick, who comes to pick her up at the airport instead of Phil. Nick is the son of Phil's girlfriend Rose, the owner of the car repair shop Phil works at. As a favor to Phil, though annoyed at first about sacrificing his own spring break, Nick helps Vada with the difficult search of learning more about her mother. It becomes nearly impossible after Vada learns that her mother's old high school burned down, but she and Nick still manage to track down a yearbook from when her mother went there.   Vada and Nick meet several people who knew her mother. Some of the things she finds out do not sit well with her, such as her mother being suspended from school for smoking. Two of these acquaintances have a look at the paper bag from Vada's small box of memories about her mother, but neither can decipher it. When another blurts out the name Jeffrey Pommeroy, thinking that he is Vada's father, Vada is crushed and wonders why her father never mentioned this person. Eventually, though with some hesitation, she goes to see Jeffrey, her mother's first husband. He provides Vada with valuable information to help with her essay, including home movies and the answer behind the date written on the paper bag. Seeing the home movies touches Vada, as she watches her mother act, as well as sing a song called "[[Smile (Charlie Chaplin song)|Smile]]".  Meanwhile, Phil has trouble proving his love to Rose after a man frequently shows up at the repair shop and continuously flatters her. When Phil finally gets the courage to show Rose what she means to him, he [[marriage proposal|proposes]].  As Vada is ready to head home, she and Nick share a goodbye kiss at the airport before she boards the plane. Nick tells Vada about a surprise in her backpack, where she finds earrings for her newly pierced ears. When Vada returns home, she realizes Shelly just had a baby boy and heads to the hospital to see her new brother. To calm his crying, Vada sings "Smile" while holding him.  Vada's essay on her mother gets an A+, and she hopes to share what she learned during her trip with her brother someday.

She has the body cremated and prepares to take the ashes to Brooklyn and pay a visit to her twin brother Edgar whom she hasn't seen for a long time. Before she leaves, however, she stops for a drink and meets Lucy. Lucy is also feeling a sense of emptiness, so she takes Nadja home. They appear to cheer each other up, and they wind up having sex together.  So, who killed Dracula? Van Helsing (Peter Fonda), of course. And Helsing's nephew Jim, who also happens to be Lucy's husband, has to bail him out of jail. Helsing knows that, if Dracula's body is not destroyed properly, he'll be back. When Helsing learns that Dracula's body has been removed from the morgue, he enlists Jim's help.  Meanwhile, Nadja goes to visit Edgar and meets his nurse and live-in lover Cassandra. Edgar is sick. Nadja persuades Cassandra to move Edgar to her apartment where she can help him by transfusing him with plasma from the blood of shark embryoes, which is what Nadja uses to stay healthy. Edgar revives enough to drink some of Nadja's blood. However, Lucy has fallen under Nadja's mesmerism. She leads both Jim and Van Helsing to Edgar's house where Nadja is staying with her Renfield. Edgar awakens long enough to warn Cassandra to leave the house, as she is in danger. Cassandra, who just happens to be Van Helsing's daughter, attempts to escape, with Nadja pursuing her, Lucy pursuing Nadja, and Jim pursuing Lucy. Cassandra runs into a gas station where it looks like two burly mechanics are going to protect her, but Nadja mesmerizes them and kills one of them. The other one shoots Nadja in the abdomen.  Edgar is improving. He unites with the Helsings to stop Nadja. He receives a "psychic fax" from Nadja, telling him that she is injured and must return to Transylvania. She also mentions that she's taking Cassandra with her, so Edgar and the Helsings high-tail it to Transylvania, too. As they approach the castle, Nadja begins a transfusion of Cassandra's blood while Cassandra sleeps. While Jim fights with Nadja's Renfield , Edgar and Helsing drive a stake through Nadja's heart. Lucy is released, Nadja is destroyed, and Cassandra wakes up. However, not all is as it seems.

Natural Born Killers
   ===Prologue=== [[Mickey Knox (Natural Born Killers)|Mickey Knox]] and his wife [[List of Natural Born Killers characters#Mallory Knox|Mallory]] stop at a diner in the [[New Mexico]] desert. A duo of [[Redneck|rednecks]] arrive and one begins [[Sexual harassment|sexually harassing]] Mallory while she is dancing. She briefly encourages him before beating him to a pulp, screaming "How sexy am I now, huh flirty boy?". Mickey and Mallory then murder all but one of the diner's staff, and one customer, culminating in a morbid game of [[Eeny, meeny, miny, moe]] to decide who lives and dies. After killing the waitress Mabel, the couple ensures that the only survivor remembers their names so that he can pass on the legend of Mickey and Mallory before they embrace and declare their undying love.  ===Part I=== Mickey and Mallory camp out in the desert, and Mallory reminisces about when they first met. A dramatised [[Flashback (literary technique)|flashback]] (done in the style of a TV sitcom, including a [[laughtrack]]) shows Mickey as a meat deliveryman who came to the house where Mallory lived with her [[Child sexual abuse|sexually abusive]] father, her neglectful mother, and her younger brother, Kevin. Mickey and Mallory fall in love instantly and leave together, stealing Mallory's father's car. Soon Mickey is arrested and imprisoned for [[Motor vehicle theft|auto theft]], but he subsequently escapes from prison during a tornado and returns to Mallory's house. The two kill Mallory's parents, and Mallory tells Kevin he is "free". Mickey and Mallory then go on the road together and get "married" on the side of a bridge, celebrating by holding a young woman hostage in their hotel room. Angered by Mickey's desire for a threesome, Mallory drives to a nearby gas station, where she flirts with the mechanic. They begin to have sex on the hood of a car, but Mallory kills him when he recognizes her as a wanted killer. During this time, Mickey [[rapes]] the hostage.  ===Part II=== The pair continue their killing spree, ultimately claiming fifty-two victims in New Mexico, [[Arizona]], and [[Nevada]]. Pursuing them is Detective [[Jack Scagnetti]], who became obsessed with mass murderers after witnessing his mother being shot and killed by [[Charles Whitman]] when he was eight. Beneath his heroic facade, he is a violent psychopath. The audience witnesses Scagnetti violently strangle a prostitute to death. The killers are also followed by self-serving tabloid journalist [[List of Natural Born Killers characters#Wayne Gale|Wayne Gale]]. Gale profiles Mickey and Mallory on his show, ''American Maniacs'', soon elevating them to cult hero status.  Mickey and Mallory get lost in the desert after taking psychedelic mushrooms. They come across a ranch where they encounter Warren Red Cloud, a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] Indian, and his grandson. The Navajo provides them with food and shelter. After the two fall asleep, the Navajo, hoping to expel the demon he perceives in Mickey, begins chanting beside the fire. This provokes nightmares and hallucinations in Mickey about his abusive parents, and he wakes up in a panicked rage and shoots Red Cloud before he realizes what he is doing. Mallory wakes up and begins yelling at Mickey. This is the first time the pair feel guilt following a murder. Fleeing from the scene, they come across a gigantic field of rattlesnakes and are both badly bitten.  They frantically drive to a drugstore to find [[Antivenom|snakebite antidote]], however the store is completely sold out. Mallory falls to the ground while Mickey runs to the pharmacy with the hopes that there will be more medication in stock. The pharmacist recognizes Mickey and sets off the silent alarm before Mickey kills him. Soon police cars arrive and Mallory is captured and subsequently beaten by the police. A gunfight breaks out between Mickey and the others while Mallory is held hostage. Scagnetti arrives and tells Mickey that unless he surrenders, he will mutilate Mallory. Mickey gives up his guns, but attacks Scagnetti with a knife. The police taser him and the scene ends with Mickey and Mallory being beaten by a group of vengeful policemen as a news crew films the action.  ===Part III=== The story picks up one year later: Mickey and Mallory have been kept in solitary confinement, and are due to be transferred to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]] after being declared insane. Scagnetti arrives at the prison and encounters Warden Dwight McClusky, who tells Scagnetti to kill the Knoxes during their transfer, and then claim they tried to escape. Scagnetti agrees to the plan. Meanwhile, Gale has persuaded Mickey to agree to a live interview that will air immediately after the [[Super Bowl]]. During the interview, Mickey gives a speech about how murder provides enlightenment and declares himself a "natural born killer". His words inspire the other inmates (who are watching the interview on TV in the [[recreation room]]) and incite them to riot.  McClusky, upon learning of the riot, orders the interview terminated despite Gale's vehement protests. Mickey is left alone with Gale, the film crew and several guards. Using a lengthy joke as a diversion, Mickey overpowers a guard and grabs his shotgun. He kills most of the guards with it and takes the survivors hostage, leading them through the prison riot. Gale follows, giving a live television report as people are beaten and killed around him.  While this goes on, Scagnetti enters Mallory's cell and attempts to seduce her. Mallory, feigning reciprocation at first, then violently smashes his face against the wall and breaks his nose. The two guards outside the cell struggle to enter while Mallory attacks Scagnetti. Finally, the two guards subdue her, and Scagnetti sprays her face with tear gas in revenge. Still live on national television, Mickey and Gale arrive at Mallory's cell, where he kills the guards and engages in a [[Mexican standoff]] with Scagnetti, eventually feigning a concession just before Mallory slashes Scagnetti's throat with a [[Shiv (weapon)|shank]] from behind. Mallory then picks up Scagnetti's gun, saying "You still like me now, Jack?" and kills him.  Mickey and Mallory continue to escape through the riot torn prison, with Gale's entire TV crew getting killed. Gale himself snaps, succumbing to [[Stockholm syndrome]] as well as indulging in his own longtime fascination for murder, and begins to shoot at the guards, claiming he finally feels "alive". After being rescued by a mysterious prisoner named Owen Traft, the trio of Mickey, Mallory, and Gale run into McClusky and a heavily armed [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] of guards. The trio takes cover in a blood-splattered shower room. McClusky threatens to storm the shower room; Mickey, in turn, threatens to kill both Gale and a guard on live TV, and the prisoners walk out the front door, to McClusky's utter dismay, as he helplessly threatens to hunt them down. McClusky and his guards are then quickly massacred by hordes of inmates.  Mickey and Mallory steal a van and escape to a forest. They give a final interview to Gale, before they tell him he must die also. He attempts various arguments to change their minds, finally appealing to their trademark practice of leaving one survivor; Mickey informs him they are leaving a witness to tell the tale, his camera. Gale accepts his fate and extends his arms as if on a cross as they shoot him dead while his unattended camera continues to roll. Unbeknownst to the three, the entire exchange is transmitted to a horrified news anchor through Gale's in-ear microphone. The couple is shown several years later, in an [[Recreational vehicle|RV]], with Mickey driving and a pregnant Mallory watching their two children play.

Nell (film)
 When Violet Kellty, who had an undiagnosed stroke, dies in her isolated cabin in the North Carolina mountains, Dr. Jerome "Jerry" Lovell, the town doctor, finds a terrified young woman hiding in the house rafters.  She speaks angrily and rapidly, but seems to have a language of her own.  Looking at Violet's [[Bible]], Jerry finds a note asking whoever finds it to look after Violet's daughter Nell.  Sheriff Todd Peterson shows Jerry a news clipping that Nell was conceived through rape.  Jerry seeks the help of Dr. Paula Olsen, a researcher working with [[autistic]] children.  Paula and her colleague Dr. Alexander "Al" Paley are interested in studying a "wild child" ([[feral child]]), and Al continues calling Nell this even after studying films showing that Nell does not fit the "wild child" profile.  Paula and Al get a court order to institutionalize Nell for further study.  Jerry  hires lawyer Don Fontana and prevents it.  The judge gives Jerry and Paula three months to interact with Nell and discover her needs.  Paula shows up on a houseboat with electronic equipment to monitor Nell's behavior while Jerry chooses to stay in Nell's cabin and quietly observe.  Paula discovers that Nell's seemingly indecipherable language is English, based partly on her mother's [[aphasia|aphasic]] speech after a [[stroke]], and partly on the secret language she shared with her decades-deceased identical twin sister. Jerry and Paula begin a grudging friendship.  Nell sleeps during the day or works inside her home and is active outdoors only after sunset.  She explains to Jerry that her mother told her about the rape and warned her that men were evildoers.  As Nell comes to trust Jerry, she sees him as a friend, the "gah'inja" her mother promised would come.  Jerry later realizes that "gah'inja" is Nell's phrase for "guardian angel."  Using popcorn as an incentive, Jerry is able to lead Nell outside and into the sun.  Nell leads Jerry and Paula to the decayed remains of her identical twin sister, May, who died in a fall while the two were playing in the woods.  Mike Ibarra, a reporter, learns of Nell's existence and visits her cabin.  Nell is curious of the visitor at first, but when he snaps a photo, the flash frightens Nell.  Jerry arrives and throws the reporter out.  Paula believes that Nell would be safer in a hospital, while Jerry feels that Nell should be left alone and allowed to live as she pleases.  The two decide that Nell should be shown a little of the world, and they make the decision to bring Nell into town.  While in town, Nell befriends Mary, Todd's depressed wife, but also encounters some raunchy boys in a pool hall until Jerry gets her out.

Jerry removes her from the hospital and hides her in a hotel.  Paula joins him, and the two admit that they love each other.  At the court hearing the next day, Al, who wants to study Nell in a controlled environment, delivers his opinion that Nell has [[Asperger syndrome]] and belongs in an institution.  Nell then comes forward and, with Jerry interpreting, speaks for herself. Five years later, Jerry and Paula bring their daughter, Ruthie, to visit Nell in her house.  It is Nell's birthday, and friends surround her.

Kwun tries to leave his son in the care of his brother but is betrayed, forcing him to kill his brother. The rich man, witnessing the carnage done by Kwun, hires Hung Hei-Kwun as a bodyguard. Initially he wants Kwun to help him bully and steal from others; Kwun refuses the offer but decides to be his bodyguard instead because he and Man Ting, his son, ran out of money.  At the same time the government has begun to crack down on [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]]. Pieces of a map are tattooed onto the backs of several pupils, who are then removed from the temple in order to keep safe the [[Ming Dynasty]] treasure the map leads to. Years ago, Hung Hei-kwun's encounter with the money hungry Ma Ling-yee did not end as Hung thought it did: Ma Ling-yee survived the fight as a result of being dipped in poison and restored by The Monk of the West District. Now a disgusting creature, his only purpose for life is to get revenge and kill Hei-kwun. The government massacres Shaolin, while Ma Ling-yee himself kills the abbot. Thereafter, he begins the hunt for Hei-kwun and the escaped pupils.  Hei-kwun and Man-ting, along with Red Bean and her mother (who plays dead in order to swindle people out of their money) arrive at Ma Kai-sin's mansion. Red Bean is to be married to Kai-sin, who is completely oblivious to Red Bean and her mother's plans to steal his wealth. While Hei-kwun and Man-ting begin to settle in, Red Bean sees Hei-kwun as a threat to her plans. She attempts to kill him, but she fails and Hei-kwun warns her that as long as he is around, she will not be causing any trouble.  Man-ting sees all of this, and accuses his father of having feelings for Red Bean, since through their travels, Hei-kwun taught his son many teachings to stay alive, such as "to kill without mercy", or "hold your temper, but only until you cannot hold it anymore".  Meanwhile, Kai-sin's son, Ling-yee, begins to bully Man-ting, due to Man-ting's low social status and Ling-yee's jealousy of Man-ting's superiority in Kung Fu. Ling-yee, a former pupil of Shaolin (who has a part of the map tattooed on his back), calls upon his former Shaolin friends (who also have the other parts of the map) to help him beat up Man-ting. Man-ting, although trying to be passive at first, loses his temper, beating all the boys up, as well as spraining Ling-yee's arm. However, Man-ting commands Ling-yee to hold still as he quickly fixes Ling-yee's arm, to prevent permanent damage. This earns him the respect of all the other boys, and they all call him "oldest brother" out of respect, although he is the youngest of them all.  On the [[Lunar New Year]], several guests dine and celebrate at Kai-yin's mansion. However, government soldiers have tracked the location of the pupils to Kai-Sin's home …

Highly-trained ex-Marine John Robbins is imprisoned for life for murdering his commanding officer after being ordered to kill innocent civilians in  [[Benghazi]] ([[Libya]]); having escaped from two Level 5 maximum security [[jail|prisons]], he is sent to a Level 6 facility. A fellow prisoner tells him about "Absolom", an island where they send the worst prisoners and is feared more than the prison. The Warden, after being held at gunpoint by Robbins, is convinced that he is a threat and exiles him to the island.  On the island, Robbins is captured by a group of prisoners known as the 'Outsiders', led by a [[Psychopathy|sociopath]] named Walter Marek and whose only rule is [[The Law of the Jungle]]. The abandoned island resort -complete with dilapidated houses and a [[swimming pool]]- is where the Outsiders have established a base. Marek forces Robbins to fight one of his men for amusement and is impressed when Robbins kills his opponent in seconds. He offers him a position in his [[gang]]; instead, Robbins knocks Marek into the pool, steals his [[rocket launcher]], and flees the Outsider's camp. He is pursued through the [[jungle]] and cornered at the edge of a high cliff before being shot in the neck by [[blowgun]] darts. After falling into the [[river]] below, he is retrieved by another prisoner group called the 'Insiders'.  Led by a terminally-ill doctor called the 'Father', the Insiders established a [[cooperative]] [[Autonomous Community|autonomous community]] with laws as opposed to the [[tyrant|tyranny]] of the Outsiders. Robbins meets Father, King -the new-arrival helper- and befriends Casey, a naive young man given a life sentence for taking part in a kidnapping gone wrong. Robbins learns that the Insiders are heavily outnumbered (over 6-to-1) by the Outsiders and that he is the only person to have ever escaped from Marek's camp. The weapon he stole is appropriated for the good of the community.  After helping repel an attack by the Outsiders, Father notes Robbins' abilities and asks him to join them. He refuses, saying he wants to leave Absolom; Father takes Robbins to the shore, explaining that they are 200 miles from the mainland, with gunships 50 miles off the coast, and [[infrared]] [[satellite reconnaissance|satellite technology]] above, mainly to detect thermal activity such as large fires or explosions.  The Insiders have secretly built a scan-proof boat and launch it to tell the outside world about Absolom. However, the boat is destroyed by [[Kamov Ka-27|attack helicopters]], causing Father to believe there is an informer among them.  Robbins learns about a new boat and demands a seat, still determined to escape. After learning that the engine needs a [[distributor]] -a part Robbins saw while in Marek's camp- he offers to retrieve it in exchange for getting on the boat; the Insiders agree. Casey follows Robbins, who infiltrates the Outsiders' camp and gets the engine part, but they are captured by the Outsiders. Robbins is forced to fight Casey to the death; knowing they won't both escape, Casey impales himself on Robbins' weapon. Robbins is taken to be executed but escapes again with the help of an Insider spy, infuriating Marek.  Knowing Marek will attack, and over stern objection, Robbins convinces the Insiders to abandon their camp, but not before lacing it with booby traps. He stays behind to fire the stolen rocket launcher, igniting an [[incendiary bomb]], killing most of the Outsiders and triggering the satellites, causing the Warden to intervene. Marek attacks Robbins, but Father defends him, dying in the process. Robbins kills Marek, before finding the new boat incinerated and the engineer stabbed to death. After discovering King's necklace in the engineer's hand, Robbins confronts King and forces him to give new coordinates to the Warden for where to land his helicopter on the island. Robbins hijacks the helicopter, throwing the Warden out the door and vowing to spread the truth about the island so the prisoners will be released. King and the Warden are left behind as unseen Outsiders close in on them.

He is often at odds with Carl Roebuck (Willis), a local contractor, suing him at every opportunity for unpaid wages and disability.

As a way to irritate him, Sully flirts with Carl's wife Toby (Griffith) openly at every opportunity (which she enjoys). He is a regular at the Iron Horse Saloon, where he often has drinks and plays cards with Wirf, Carl, Rub, and the town sheriff.  A running joke is the repeated theft of Carl's snowblower.

North (1994 film)
   North is a [[child prodigy]], skilled in academics, sports, and drama, admired by many for his good work and obedient attitude, but unappreciated, he feels, by his own parents. One day, while finding solace in a living room display at a mall, he complains to the [[Easter Bunny]]—a man in a pink bunny suit—that his parents, alone among all the adults in his neighborhood, seem unable to see his talents. The Easter Bunny recommends that North simply tell his parents how he feels; but North says if they can't appreciate him, they don't deserve him.    With the help and encouragement of his friend Winchell, who works on the school paper, North devises a plan to "[[emancipation of minors|divorce]]" himself from his parents, and hires [[Ambulance chasing|ambulance-chasing]] [[lawyer]] Arthur Belt to file the papers.  The announcement of his divorce takes North's parents completely by surprise, and renders them [[coma]]tose. They cannot object when Judge Buckle grants North's petition, and gives him one summer to find new parents; if he cannot, he will have to move to an orphanage.   North's first stop is [[Texas]], where his parental candidates attempt to fatten him up, to be more like their first son, Buck, who died in a stampede. They then stage a musical number about the other horrible plans they have for him. Gabby, a sharpshooting cowboy, presents North with a souvenir from his act—a silver dollar with a bullet hole shot through its center—and advises him to move on.  His next stop is [[Hawaii]], where Governor and Mrs. Ho, who cannot have children of their own, are eager to adopt him. North is overjoyed; but the governor unveils a new state campaign to encourage mainlanders to move to Hawaii. North learns, to his horror, that billboards featuring him in a mortifying pose will soon be on view throughout the U.S.  On the beach, he meets a tourist with a [[metal detector]] who explains that parents should not rely on children for their own personal gain.    In [[Alaska]] he settles into an [[Inuit]] village, where his prospective parents send their elderly grandfather out to sea on an ice floe so that he may die with dignity.  As the long, dark winter begins to envelop Alaska, North realizes that his summer is almost up.  Meanwhile, his real parents, still comatose, are put on display in a museum.  North's quest has stimulated children around the world to leave their parents, and to hire Belt and Winchell, who are both now rich and powerful.  North’s next family is [[Amish]], but he is quickly discouraged by the size of their family (and the lack of electricity).  His experiences in [[Zaire]], [[China]], and [[Paris]] are equally fruitless. At last, back in America, he finds the Nelsons, who give North the attention and appreciation he craves; but he still is not happy. "The Nelsons are good folks,” says a sleigh driver. “They're just not ''your'' folks."  In despair, North finds himself in [[New York City]], where Winchell and Belt, fearing the demise of their lucrative business, plot to assassinate him. On the run, North receives a videotape from his newly revived parents begging him to forgive them and return home.  Standup [[comedian]] Joey Fingers encourages him to do so: "A bird in the hand is always greener than the grass under the other guy's bushes."  At the airport, his path is blocked by a mob of kids who have followed his example, and are angry that he is giving up and going home, so North is forced to ship himself home in a [[FedEx]] box. He reaches his house just in time to beat the orphanage deadline; but as he runs toward his parents, an assassin takes aim. As he squeezes the trigger, North awakens in the mall, now empty. The Easter Bunny takes him home, where he is greeted warmly by his parents, who have been worried while he has been gone. It has all been a dream—but in his pocket, North discovers Gabby’s silver dollar with the hole through the middle. North says he has always had it, "for good luck".

The action begins with the murder of the town's Marshal Stone by a power-hungry villain called Red Eye ([[Andrew Divoff]]). Using a substance prized on the planet—which also happens to short out electrical devices—Red Eye cheats his way to victory during a showdown on the street, killing Stone and disabling his cyborg deputy, Stell ([[Meg Foster]]). He and his cronies begin to bully and persuade the townspeople into allowing him to take over the town. Oblivion's mortician, Gaunt, who possesses supernatural ability to foresee death, seeks out the Marshal's son, Zack ([[Richard Joseph Paul]]), who is prospecting in the wilderness.  Meanwhile, Zack saves a "native," Buteo (Jimmie F. Skaggs), from an untimely death by giant scorpion. They team up just before Gaunt arrives with the news of Marshal Stone's death, and they all journey together to Oblivion for the funeral. During a misadventure in a saloon along the way, Zack avoids violence, even when harangued by one of Red Eye's henchmen. After attending his father's funeral, Zack visits his old friend Doc Valentine ([[George Takei]]), an inventor whose technology had failed to protect the Marshal. At the local whorehouse, a townswoman, Mattie ([[Jackie Swanson]]), learns that Zack is not a coward, but an empath, who feels everything that those around him experience. This leads him to abhor violence. Buteo learns that one of Red Eye's associates had been responsible for the deaths of his wife and children, and seeks revenge. Challenging him to a fair fight, Buteo triumphs and his opponent is killed. Red Eye and his gang capture Buteo in retaliation, place him in stocks, and whip him.  Sensing that something unsavoury is going on, Zack confronts his fears, saving Buteo and shooting many of the townspeople who had taken Red Eye's side. Apparently having won a victory, Zack celebrates until he learns that Mattie has been taken by Red Eye into the Badlands. He and his friends rush to save her, and in the process defeat all of the villains for good.

On Deadly Ground
 [[Aegis]] Oil operates Aegis 1, an [[oil refinery]] and several [[Drilling rig|oil rigs]] in [[Alaska]]. They purchased the oil rights from the local [[Alaskan Natives]] 20 years ago, but stand to lose them if the refinery isn’t on-line by a certain deadline. With 13 days to go, and billions of dollars at stake, the company cuts corners and uses faulty equipment.  Hugh Palmer, a rig foreman, is aware of this; as he predicts, his rig catches fire. It takes Forrest Taft (Seagal), a specialist in dealing with [[oil drilling]]-related fires, to extinguish the fire. Taft refuses to believe Hugh’s story of faulty equipment at first, but later discovers that it is true after accessing the company’s computer records and finding that the next shipments of new, adequate equipment have been delayed way past the deadline. Michael Jennings ([[Michael Caine]]), the ruthless CEO of Aegis, deludedly believes that Hugh's carelessness is to blame for the rig fire and, after discovering his efforts to alert the [[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] about the use of substandard equipment, arranges for him to be ‘dealt with’ by his henchmen MacGruder ([[John C. McGinley]]) and Otto ([[Sven-Ole Thorsen]]).  Jennings is alerted to Taft's activities and orders that Taft also get eliminated as well. MacGruder and Otto brutally ransack Palmer's cabin for the evidence against Jennings, and torture and murder Palmer without finding it. Taft is set up for a trap by investigating a supposedly damaged pump station. He is badly wounded by an explosion, but survives and is rescued by Masu ([[Joan Chen]]), the daughter of Silook, the chief of her tribe.  MacGruder and Otto are unable to locate Taft's body, and Jennings assumes that he is still alive. Taft is being cared for by Silook's tribe. After unsuccessfully trying to leave using a [[dogsled]],  Silook has Taft undergo a [[vision quest]] in which he sees the truth. When made to choose between two women, Taft opts for the elderly, clothed grandmother, forgoing the erotically-charged nude [[Iñupiaq]] [[seductress]]. The grandmother warns Taft that time is running out for those who pollute the world. Taft realizes that his only option is to see the refinery closed. He takes off, with MacGruder and Otto hot on his trail.  At Silook's village, they demand to know where Taft is. Silook refuses to give the information and is fatally shot by MacGruder. Jennings berates MacGruder for killing Silook in front of his entire tribe. They bring in a group of New Orleans-based [[mercenary|mercenaries]] led by Stone ([[R. Lee Ermey]]) to finish off Taft before Aegis 1 can go on-line. They also have an [[FBI Counterterrorism Division|FBI Anti-Terrorist Unit]] at the refinery.  Accompanied by Masu, Taft (who is probably ex-CIA and an expert on sabotage and demolition), collects weapons and explosives and manages to enter the refinery complex, and begins to effectively sabotage the refinery. MacGruder (who is killed by Taft in the process of getting thrown into the helicopter's tail rotor blades for killing Hugh and Silook), Otto (who was killed earlier at Hugh's cabin) and Jennings’ ruthlessly efficient female assistant Liles (who crashes her truck into a gasoline tank in an escape attempt), are powerless to defeat him and are all killed in various gruesome ways; the FBI also pulls out, revealing in the process that Taft might be ex-CIA.   Taft and Masu confront Jennings, string him up, and drop him into a pool of oil, effectively drowning Jennings in his own wealth. They then escape as a series of explosions destroy the rest of Aegis 1.  As an epilogue, Taft, far from being arrested for sabotage and multiple murders (self defense), is asked to deliver a speech at the [[Alaska State Capitol]] about the dangers of oil pollution, and the companies that are endangering the ecosystem.<ref></ref> During the speech they show a scene of one of the first commercial hydrogen fuel cell systems developed by Perry Energy Systems.

Toot kisses her, but she reacts violently and storms out, believing he is "just like the rest of them." Confused, Grace eventually goes home to an angry Jake with his friends. Bully asks for a goodnight kiss to test his power over her. Grace refuses and Jake sees it as a sign of disrespect and tears her journal in two and nearly beats her up. Beth returns home from searching for Grace, and then screams hysterically after finding her daughter has hanged herself from a tree branch in the backyard.  Jake deals with the tragedy in his usual selfish way, going to the pub with his mates while the rest of the family takes Grace's body to a [[tangihanga]]. Beth stands up to him properly for the first time when he refuses to let her be taken to the [[marae]]. The film cross-cuts between the mourning, Jake getting wasted at the pub and the family on the marae. Boogie impresses Beth with his Māori singing at the funeral, and Toot says his goodbyes, telling Grace the gentle kiss was all his gesture meant. Boogie reassures Toot that Grace loved him, and Beth invites Toot to live with them.  Reading Grace's diary later that day, Beth finds out about the rape and confronts Bully at the pub. Jake at first threatens Beth for accusing his friend, but Nig steps between them, protecting his mother. Nig hands his father Grace's diary, and after glancing at it, Jake explodes, nearly beating Bully to death. Beth blames Jake just as much as Bully because of his violent lifestyle, and decides to leave him.   Beth states her intention to take their children back to her Māori village and traditions, defiantly telling Jake that her Māori heritage gives her the strength to resist his control over her. Jake hopelessly sits on a curb outside the pub as the family leaves, with sirens wailing in the background.

 [[Pessimism|Pessimistic]] 10-year-old Richard Tyler lives life based on statistics and [[panphobia|fears everything]]. His exasperated parents have tried multiple ways to build up the courage of their son, but to little success. Richard is sent to buy a bag of nails for building a [[treehouse]]. However, Richard gets caught in a harsh thunderstorm and takes shelter in a [[library]]. He meets Mr. Dewey, an eccentric [[librarian]] who insists he is in need of a special book and gives him a library card, despite Richard explaining he is only sheltering from the storm. Searching for a phone, Richard finds a large [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] painted with many famous literary characters. He slips on water dripping from his coat and falls over, knocking himself out. Richard awakens to find the rotunda art melting, which washes over him and the library, turning them into [[illustration]]s.  He is met by the Pagemaster, the mythical Keeper of Books and Guardian of the Written Word. Richard asks for directions to the exit so the Pagemaster sends him through the fiction section toward the green neon exit sign. Along the way, Richard befriends three [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] books: Adventure, a swashbuckling pirate-like book; Fantasy, a sassy but caring fairy tale book; and Horror, a fearful "Hunchbook" with a misshapen spine. The three agree to help Richard if he checks them out using his new library card. Together, the quartet encounters classic-fictional characters. They meet [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll]] who turns into Mr. Hyde, driving them to the open waters of the Land of Adventure. However, the group is separated after [[Moby-Dick]] attacks, following the whale's battle with [[Captain Ahab]].

However, Adventure's bumbling awakens a dormant [[dragon]]. Richard tries to fight the dragon with a sword and shield, but the dragon swallows him.

They enter a large dark room where the Pagemaster awaits them. Richard accuses the Pagemaster of causing the horrors that he suffered, but the Pagemaster reveals the journey was intended to make Richard face his fears. Dr. Jekyll, Captain Ahab, [[Long John Silver]], and the [[dragon]] reappear in a magical twister and congratulate him. The Pagemaster then swoops Richard and the books into the twister, sending them back to the real world.  Richard awakens, finding Adventure, Fantasy, and Horror lying next to him as real books. Mr. Dewey finds him, and, even though the library policy only allows a person to check out two books at time, lets him check out all three books "just this once". Richard returns home a braver child, sleeping in his new treehouse with his books.  
The Paper (film)
 The film takes place during a 24-hour period. Henry Hackett ([[Michael Keaton]]) is the metro editor of the ''New York Sun'', a fictional<ref>The real ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' merged with another paper in 1950, but the film version shares the same [[masthead (publishing)|masthead]]. Since the film's release, [[The New York Sun|a new incarnation]] of the ''Sun'' has appeared, also using the masthead.</ref> New York City tabloid. He is a workaholic who loves his job, but the long hours and low pay are leading to discontent. He is at risk of experiencing the same fate as his editor-in-chief, Bernie White ([[Robert Duvall]]), who put his work first at the expense of his family.  The paper's owner, Graham Keighley ([[Jason Robards]]), faces dire financial straits, so he has Alicia Clark ([[Glenn Close]]), the managing editor and Henry's nemesis, impose unpopular cutbacks. Henry's wife Martha ([[Marisa Tomei]]), a fellow ''Sun'' reporter on leave and about to give birth, is fed up because Henry seems to have less and less time for her, and she really dislikes Alicia Clark. She urges him to seriously consider an offer to leave the ''Sun'' and become an assistant managing editor at the ''New York Sentinel'', another fictional newspaper (based on ''The New York Times''), which would mean more money, shorter hours, and more respectability, but might also be a bit boring for his tastes.  Minor subplots involve Alicia, Bernie, and ''Sun'' columnist Michael McDougal ([[Randy Quaid]]). McDougal is threatened by an angry city official named Sandusky ([[Jason Alexander]]) whom McDougal's column had been tormenting for the past several weeks. Their drunken confrontation in a bar (later in the film) leads to gunfire, which gets Alicia shot in the leg through the wall. Alicia, who is having an affair with ''Sun'' reporter Carl ([[Bruce Altman]]) and has expensive tastes, schemes to get a raise in her salary. Bernie reveals to Henry that he has recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer, which causes him to spend time tracking down his estranged daughter Deanne White ([[Jill Hennessey]]), in an attempt to reconcile before his time is up.  Meanwhile, a hot story is circulating the city, involving the murder of two white businessmen in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]] and two African-American teenagers arrested for the crime, which both Henry and McDougal believe to be false charges (due to overhearing NYPD discuss the arrest on the ''Sun'' office's police scanner). Because of this story, Henry is wrought with tough decisions, deadlines, and personal crises (including his interpersonal issues with Alicia). He becomes obsessed with getting to the bottom of the case, getting others from the ''Sun'' staff to investigate along with him. He goes so far as to blow his job offer at the ''Sentinel'' after he steals information about the case from the editor's desk notes and reports it during a ''Sun'' staff meeting.  Martha does some investigating for him and discovers (through her friend in the Justice Department) that the businessmen murdered were bankers who stole a large sum of money from their largest investor: a trucking company that happens to have ties to the Mafia. With this new evidence, Henry begins to believe that it was all a setup and the Brooklyn boys were likely just caught in the midst of it, somehow. He is so determined to get the correct story that he leaves a dinner with Martha and his parents to go to the police station with McDougal (as they need police confirmation that the boys were not responsible for the murder before printing the story).  They corner McDougal's police contact, an officer named Richie, in the station bathroom, and through repeated interrogation (and the promise of his anonymity in the story) get him to admit that the kids are indeed innocent and just happened to be walking by the scene of the crime when they were caught. The reason for their arrest was largely due to city officials' insistence that the media portray the NYPD as being on top of such high-profile crimes immediately to keep NYC tourism from dropping. Henry and McDougal race back to the ''Sun'' office, excited about their exclusive for the paper.  They discover that Alicia has approved the paper's original front-page headline and story stating that the teens were guilty, despite Henry and McDougal having just returned with the evidence proving otherwise. This results in a physical fight between  Henry and Alicia, after he tries to stop the presses, which are already printing the papers with the wrong information.  Martha is later rushed to the hospital for an emergency caesarean section due to uterine hemorrhaging. Alicia, accidentally shot by Sandusky in the bar and brought to the same hospital, has a change of heart. She calls the ''Sun'' office, has the print room stop the run, and the original headline is corrected to Henry's suggestion: "They Didn't Do It", along with McDougal's story. The new editions are printed just in time for the following morning's circulation. The movie ends with Martha giving birth to a healthy baby boy, and a morning news radio report states that because of the ''Sun''s exclusive story, the Brooklyn teens were released from jail with no charges pressed, closing out a wild 24 hours.

During the [[limousine]] ride to the funeral, Johnny reveals that his mother is dead and that his father, a [[sales representative]], is rarely around because of the nature of his job.  After the funeral, Johnny sneaks into the Thorpe house and places a baby monitor in the vent so he can eavesdrop. Later, Melissa invites Johnny to a barbecue that she and Cammie are having in which Johnny accepts under the condition that he is allowed to cook. Johnny takes video of the BBQ while he waits for Melissa, only to discover that she is going on a date with her boyfriend, Brian. When Brenda arrives to babysit Cammie, Johnny reacts violently by smashing a barbecue plate and then retreats to his home.  Later that night, Johnny walks back to Melissa's house with a letter of apology only to stumble upon Brenda [[making out]] with her boyfriend. Brenda catches him and, the next morning, tells Melissa that Johnny has been spying on her. Johnny seeks revenge by tampering with the antenna that Brenda uses to sneak into her bedroom window. Successful in his scheme, Brenda falls and injures herself. Johnny later explains casually to Melissa that Brenda is now [[paraplegic]].  When Johnny takes Cammie along to collect money from his paper route, he tells her that one of his customers, Mrs. Rosemont, is a witch. When Johnny walks away from Cammie to retrieve his money from the mailbox, Mrs. Rosemont warns Cammie that Johnny has the [[Mark of Cain]] and that she should stay away from him. Later, Cammie tells her mother what was revealed to her when she was with Johnny collecting money. Concerned, Melissa confronts Mrs. Rosemont.  Johnny sneaks into Melissa's house in order to make an apple pie. Melissa is not pleased about this. Later that night, Johnny, along with his father, apologizes for his actions. Melissa tells Johnny that he cannot come to the house unless he is invited. She then tells his father that he should spend more time with him. Johnny's father gives his son a set of golf clubs as an apology for not being there for him, and tells Johnny that they will be spending much more time together in California because of a recent promotion. Fearing that he will not see what he considers to be "his family" again, Johnny kills his father with a fold-out putter.  Soon, Melissa goes to Mrs. Rosemont where it is explained that Johnny was emotionally and physically abused by his mother and that he murdered her. When Johnny finds out about their conversation (owing to his eavesdropping device), Johnny grows angry and rides his bike to Mrs. Rosemont's house. He snatches her inhaler and leads her to believe that he killed her dog - he actually smashed ketchup bottles while the dog was in a different room completely fine. Mrs Rosemont then has a fatal heart attack.  Johnny then goes to Brian's workplace, knocks him out, and sets it on fire. Brian manages to regain consciousness fast enough to escape. Johnny then calls Melissa and tells her to come to his house. Melissa denies Johnny's request until she hears Cammie calling her name.  Johnny's true intentions are finally unveiled when he reveals that he killed Melissa's mother to lure them to the house in hopes of starting a new family. Melissa frantically searches Johnny's house wherever she hears Cammie's voice only to find that the sound has been coming from Johnny's home movie and the baby monitor in the basement. As Melissa incessantly refuses to be Johnny's mother, an angry Johnny then tries to bury Melissa in a hole created for his father, only to have her escape through the window.  Armed with a pickaxe, Johnny pursues Melissa, who is carrying Cammie as she is running. Melissa soon wears out and tells Cammie to run. Johnny and Melissa struggle with the pickaxe until the police arrive. Johnny tries to use this to his advantage, frantically lying, saying Melissa is crazy and tried to kill him. Johnny then sees Brian step out of the squad car, saying that it's over. The cops take a hysterical Johnny away as he begs for Melissa to tell them he is innocent as the film ends.

 Police detective and part-time novelist Gene Ralston ([[Scott Glenn]]) wakes from a nightmare in which he struggles with another man at a sand quarry, falls, and suffocates when he is covered with sand. In the morning he notices that a new neighbor has moved into the house across the street. Introducing herself to him, Tory Bass ([[Lara Flynn Boyle]]) exhibits a skittish manner and admits she is preoccupied by the feeling that someone has been murdered. Gene tells Tory that he is a policeman, and she admits that she was involved with a man who is also a cop.   That evening, Gene has his partner Larry Talbert ([[Anthony LaPaglia]]) and his wife Emily ([[Sheree J. Wilson]]) over for dinner and they talk about Gene's developing career as a writer, but Gene has his mind on Tory and occasionally glances over at her house across the street. The next day Gene goes to visit Tory and there is an immediate attraction as she opens up to him, and they make love on her living room floor. Later in the day a delivery man brings Gene some roses from Tory with a note inviting him to come over after dark, but when Gene arrives he discovers that she's been murdered. Larry heads up the murder investigation and orders Gene off of the case due to his involvement with the victim.   Nevertheless, Gene investigates anyway, and discovers that the dead girl's body isn't marked by a distinctive cut on her hand that Gene knows was there. Further complicating matters, Emily attempts to seduce Gene.  In the squad room, when Gene starts to discuss the case, Larry has no idea what he is talking about, as  Larry is unaware of any murder. And when Gene goes to the house where he met Tory, another  woman is living there. It is as if Tory never existed. Confused, Gene consults Police Department psychiatrist, Dr Bert James ([[David Ogden Stiers]]), who admits he doesn't understand what Gene is experiencing. As Gene continues writing his novel, he wonders what is going on. Further investigation reveals that, under a different name, the woman that Gene knows as Tory was involved in a previous homicide case and that Larry knows about it.   Following Larry to a hospital, Gene discovers that he has been dreaming, as he awakens from a coma he has been in for 13 months since he actually ''was'' buried in a sand pit and had his oxygen supply cut off. What we have seen to this point has been the attempt of Gene's [[unconscious mind]] to forge a coherent story out of a mélange of true memories, such as the sand pit, misremembered items, like the "Tory" character, and what has filtered through while in the coma, as for instance Dr James, who is, in reality, Gene's attending neurologist.  Now that he is awake, he is contacted by "Tory" who has been waiting for him to come out of his coma. It turns out that there was more to the murder case she was involved with than Gene and Larry exposed before Gene fell into the quarry.

During his visit, accident-prone Tom manages to make enemies with nearly every group of students, and thus spends much of his visit evading the growing mob upset with him.  During his visit, Tom also finds himself in the middle of a war between "The Pit" and "Balls and Shaft", two rival groups. Among the members of the latter is Rand McPherson ([[David Spade]]), who, with the other Balls and Shaft members, want the outlawed [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek system]] to return. Meanwhile, "The Pit", an unofficial group, runs the former "Balls and Shaft" frat house in a highly disorganized manner.  Currently inhabited by seniors Gutter ([[Jon Favreau]]) and Mullaney ([[Alex Désert]]), mid-year Freshman co-ed Katy ([[Megan Ward]]), and led by multi-year senior James "Droz" Andrews ([[Jeremy Piven]]), The Pit is a party-centric house that rebels against the politically correct protests; their counter-protests and parties are a frequent source of complaint forms.  Other factions on campus include a commune-style house of pot users called Jerrytown that Gutter often frequents, a [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] group known as the Womynists, an Afrocentrist group suspecting the Pit of conspiring against them, and the college president, Ms. Garcia-Thompson ([[Jessica Walter]]), who is obsessed with enforcing "sensitivity awareness" and [[multiculturalism]] to an extreme.  She proposes that Bisexual Asian Studies should have its own building, as well as a plan to change the campus mascot to a Whooping Crane instead of an offensive Native American character during their Bicentennial Anniversary.  Garcia-Thompson conspires behind closed doors with Balls and Shaft to get the established residents of The Pit kicked off campus and give Rand control of the house.  She provokes the Pit residents with a damage bill from their past semester.  Left unpaid, the campus would seize their house, leaving them homeless and unable to continue attendance at PCU without getting jobs.  The Pit responds by throwing a party to raise the funds needed.  The Womynists take offense to The Pit's flyers advertising the party, and hold a protest outside as the house residents conspire to steal alcohol and convince students to attend.  The party at first appears to be a failure.  However, a series of unlikely events results in [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] performing at the party. Students begin streaming in (initially to seize Tom for his prior mistakes) and the party successfully raises the funds to keep the house. Garcia-Thompson (after being locked in a room by Droz with the song "[[Afternoon Delight]]" playing on repeat), deciding to act on the many complaints against The Pit, shuts down the party and expels the residents of The Pit in spite of their fundraising efforts.  Tom then informs Droz about an overheard conversation with the Board of Trustees: the President's politically correct changes are negatively affecting both their past legacy and media publicity.  At the bicentennial ceremony the following morning, Droz and former Pit residents succeed in liberating the Whooping Crane and provoking the other students into an impromptu protest against protesting (chanting "We're not gonna protest!"). The demonstration establishes that even with The Pit shut down, the President cannot control the student population, resulting in the Board of Trustees summarily firing her. Meanwhile, Rand complains about all the other student groups, unaware that Droz has surreptitiously used the podium microphone to broadcast his rant to the entire campus.  Later, Tom heads home having decided to commit to PCU as the Pit has moved back into their house. As he sits on the bus, he sees Rand, who is now in Tom's position at the beginning of the film: being chased by the students across campus.

Pavithram
 The movie begins with an older man's dream; Unni (played by Mohanlal) is roused from his house and told to come in haste to see his father (someone Unni has longed believed to be dead). He is greeted by a crowd of people who begin to make fun of him and Unni wakes up. An astrologer interprets the dream as a harbinger of Easwara Pillai's (Unni's father) death and advices Unni do the last rites for his "dead" father. During the rituals, Unni comes to find it difficult to go through with the rituals as he then believe that his father is alive; he walks away declaring that his father is not dead.  The story flashes back to Unni's youth when he was living in his ancestral home with his parents. He is courting Meera, a beautiful woman with a penchant for books and stories. Unni and Meera appear all set to be married and Meera's father wants Unni to take an MBA in England and eventually take over the [[rein]]s of the company's responsibilities. Unni makes it clear that he has no interest in pursuing such a career and his dreams are very simple.    Unni has a brother Ramakrishnan (Sreenivasan) who is a doctor living in the city with his wife. Devaki (Unni's mother) wants to have a grandchild and she is concerned as Ramakrishnan has been married a few years without children. In her desire to become a grandmother she visits many temples and holy functions to pray for a grandchild. But in a twist of fate an amorous relation takes a second bud between Devaki and her husband Easwarapilla and she becomes pregnant. The parents are ashamed at the first signs of the pregnancy and worry about how their grown children will react to this news.  But they are surprised by the enthusiasm of Unni and the mature and supportive attitude of Ramakrishnan.  Devaki gives birth to a girl but dies during childbirth. Ramakrishnan's wife does not seem to be interested in children much less in one she considers to be a source of shame. In the absence of anyone to take care of the child Unni steps in to foster the child. Soon after in a heated moment, Unni scolds his father and Easwarapilla leaves town as he is devastated by the recent happenings. This leaves Unni with the double responsibility of being a brother as well as father to Meenakshi.  Unni breaks off his relationship with Meera upon Meera's father's request as he feels the child will always be a source for problems in their relationship. Unni goes ahead with it as he feels Meenakshi needs him and there's no one else to take that role.    The story then comes back to the present as Meenakshi is a grown girl preparing for her 10 STD exams. Unni has regressed to a village life after he chose to play Meenakshi's brother-father. Over the years Unni has become possessive of Meenakshi as she has been the center of his existence. When it comes time for Meenakshi to go to the city and stay in a hostel to continue her studies, Unni goes through a trying period before finally coming to terms with the inevitable. In the city, Meenakshi is exposed to a new culture and fashions that she was not aware when growing up in the village and she becomes enamored in it.    Meenakshi becomes involved in the city lifestyle, even meeting with Ramakrishnan's wife. This causes friction between her and Unni leading to fights and hostile encounters when they meet. Meenakshi moves to the city and Unni follows her to apologize but sees her involved in an accident.  Meenakshi survives the accident and Ramakrishnan chastises her for ignoring Unni who gave up his dreams for her. Meenakshi repents and goes back to the village to meet with Unni where she realizes that he has become mentally imbalanced after the trauma of seeing her in the accident and she decides to spend the rest of her life taking care of him.

Mike tries to give a message to Tim, warning him that "there are thousands of them", but Mike is paralyzed by the Tall Man.  Meanwhile, Rocky defeats her attacker and helps Reggie. Cut free by the Jody-sphere, Tim runs into the remaining looters, who are killed by the Jody-sphere and Reggie's 4-barrel shotgun. The trio crash into the embalming room, where the Tall Man is operating on Mike. Rocky impales the Tall Man with a spear dipped in liquid nitrogen, and they lock him in the refrigerator room. However, a golden sphere breaks out of his head and attacks them; Reggie catches it in a plunger and, with some help, manages to dump it into the nitrogen tank. Mike finds a golden sphere in his own head, and his eyes turn silver. Complaining of the cold, he leaves with Jody and warns Reggie to stay away. Reggie suggests exploring the mortuary, but Rocky declines and leaves too. Tim reports that Mike tried to warn him, but they find out too late that there are dozens of spheres left, and Reggie is pinned to the wall by them.

A Place for Annie
  Nurse Susan cares for six week old Annie, an [[HIV]] positive baby. Rather than seeing her being left at Treemont Centre where she will wait to die, Susan decides that she wants her. Reasoning with her son David, who is understandably concerned about the idea, Susan files and signs adoption papers and Annie is legally her foster daughter. Next, Susan calls for a babysitter and finds one in the form of Dorothy.  One year later at Annie's first birthday, Alice comes to tell Susan that Annie's mother, Linda, wants her back as she has finished her drug rehab and has taken the notion to a court hearing with Alice representing her. Knowing that Linda knows nothing about taking care of Annie, Susan fights but loses the case however she is granted supervised visits.  On one of these visit, Susan finds that Linda is surprisingly apathetic towards her own daughter which only causes her cold demeanor towards Linda to harden even more so.  Despite agreeing to Susan's instructions for Annie's care Linda refuses to phone her and let her know of how things are proceeding. When Susan and David find Linda's slovenly apartment they remove Annie from the premises as the living conditions could further weaken Annie's already compromised immune system but unfortunately this only results in the judge awarding custody to Linda the very next day.  Seeing no alternative, Susan takes Linda into her home as she needs to be in decent accommodations and Susan needs to be with Annie. Although many heated confrontations arise, Linda soon settles in and explains the complications she faced during her childhood. Likewise, Susan opens up to Linda and tells her that her parent don't talk to her anymore as they disowned her when she was pregnant with David because she and David's father weren't married at the time.  This inspires Linda to come to the conclusion that the reason she wanted Annie was so she could do at least one thing right and be a mother to her as she had fouled up her own life so many times. Days later, Susan calls Linda's mother to let her know of Linda's progress. This ends in failure as Linda's mother gives Susan the funeral home number. Linda then laments sadly on how she has tried to find some sort of forgiveness for all the bad choices she has made throughout her life and how she couldn't believe it when Susan told her that she was disowned by her parents and that they can live their lives without knowing their own daughter or even their own grandson while Susan herself is such a good person and mother.  On the way to have a smoke, Linda collapses in the hallway and is immediately rushed to the hospital. On the way to the emergency room, Linda informs the doctors that she probably won't live through the ordeal and that when it's time for her to go let her go. Susan visits her and Linda vows to go to school and make something of herself like Susan did if she makes it but voices that she won't live to do so. Susan expresses hope that Linda does pull through as she has a lot to give.  Next day at home, a doctor comes and informs Susan that Annie is no longer testing for the HIV antibodies. Apparently Annie only contracted the HIV antibodies from Linda when she was born but not the virus in and of itself. The doctors thought she had HIV due to her low T-cell count and her susceptibility to her infections. The doctor explains that this means Annie will live a long, normal and healthy life.  Susan then revisits Linda and tells her that Annie doesn't have HIV and is going to do all the things that any other child can.  Sometime later, Linda recovers and returns to Susan's home where she is warmly welcomed. Linda checks on Annie, saying that she is going to have a great life. To everyone's surprise Linda prepares to leave for a hospice as she doesn't want Annie to see her die. With great reluctance Susan allows Linda to follow through on this idea as it is the right thing to do. Linda gives Annie a letter to deliver to Susan and then departs. Susan reads Linda's letter: it is the maternity paper wavering all legal custody of Annie to Susan.  Susan and Annie wave goodbye to Linda as she leaves for the hospice.

Il Postino: The Postman
 Set in the year 1950, Pablo Neruda, the famous [[Chile]]an poet, is exiled to a small island in Italy for political reasons. His wife accompanies him. On the island, a local, Mario Ruoppolo, is dissatisfied with being a fisherman, like his father. Mario looks for other work and is hired as a temporary postman, with Neruda as his only customer. He uses his bicycle to hand deliver Neruda's mail (the island has no cars). Though poorly educated, the postman eventually befriends Neruda and becomes further influenced by Neruda's political views and poetry.  Meanwhile, Mario falls in love with a beautiful young lady, Beatrice Russo, who works in her aunt's village cafe. He is shy with her, but he enlists Neruda's help. Mario constantly asks Neruda if particular metaphors that he uses are suitable for his poems. Mario is able to better communicate with Beatrice and express his love through poetry. Despite the aunt's strong disapproval of Mario, because of his sensual poetry (which turns out to be largely stolen from Neruda), Beatrice responds favourably.  The two are married. The priest refuses to allow Mario to have Neruda as his best man because of politics; however, this is soon resolved. This was because Di Cosimo was the politician in office in the area with the [[Christian Democrats]]. At the wedding, Neruda receives the welcome news that there is no longer a Chilean warrant for his arrest so he returns to Chile.  Mario writes a letter but never gets any reply. Several months later, he receives a letter from Neruda. However, to his dismay, it is actually from his secretary, asking Mario to send Neruda's old belongings back to Chile. While there Mario comes upon an old [[phonograph]] and listens to the song he first heard when he met Neruda. Moved, he makes recordings of all the beautiful sounds on the island onto a cassette including the heartbeat of his soon-to-be-born child.  Several years later, Neruda finds Beatrice and her son, Pablito (named in honour of Neruda) in the same old inn. From her, he discovers that Mario had been killed before their son was born. Mario had been scheduled to recite a poem he had composed at a large [[communist]] gathering in Naples; the demonstration was violently broken up by the police. She gives Neruda recordings of village sounds that Mario had made for him. The film ends with Neruda walking in the beach he used to talk with Mario, showing at the same time the communist gathering in which Mario was killed.  
Pom Poko
 The story begins in late 1960s Japan. A group of ''tanuki'' are threatened by a gigantic suburban development project called [[Tama New Town|New Tama]], in the [[Tama Hills]] on the outskirts of [[Tokyo]]. The development is cutting into their forest habitat and dividing their land. The story resumes in early 1990s Japan, during the early years of the [[Heisei era]]. With limited living space and food decreasing every year, the tanuki begin fighting among themselves for the diminishing resources, but at the urging of the matriarch Oroku ("Old Fireball"), they decide to unify to stop the development.  Several tanuki lead the resistance, including the aggressive chief Gonta, the old guru Seizaemon, the wise-woman Oroku, and the young and resourceful Shoukichi. Using their illusion skills (which they must re-learn after having forgotten them), they stage a number of diversions including industrial sabotage. These attacks injure and even kill people, frightening construction workers into quitting, but more workers immediately replace them. In desperation, the tanuki send out messengers to seek help from various legendary elders from other regions.  After several years, one of the messengers returns bringing a trio of elders from the distant island of [[Shikoku]], where development is not a problem and the tanuki are still worshipped. In an effort at re-establishing respect for the [[supernatural]], the group stages a massive "[[Hyakki Yagyō|ghost parade]]" to make the humans think the town is haunted. The strain of the massive illusion kills one of the elders, and the effort seems wasted when the owner of a nearby [[Amusement park|theme park]] takes credit for the parade, claiming it was a [[publicity stunt]].  With this setback, the unity of the tanuki finally fails and they break up into smaller groups, each following a different strategy. One group led by Gonta takes the route of [[eco-terrorism]], holding off workers until they are wiped out in a pitched battle with the police. Another group desperately attempts to gain media attention through television appearances to plead their case against the habitat's destruction. One of the elders becomes [[Dementia|senile]] and starts a [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] dancing [[cult]] among the tanuki who are unable to transform, eventually sailing away with them in a ship that takes them to their deaths, while the other elder investigates joining the human world as the last of the transforming ''[[kitsune]]'' (foxes) have already done.  When all else fails, in a last act of defiance, the remaining tanuki stage a grand illusion, temporarily transforming the urbanized land back into its pristine state to remind everyone of what has been lost.<ref></ref> Finally, with their strength exhausted, the tanuki most trained in illusion follow the example of the kitsune: they blend into human society one by one, abandoning those who cannot transform. While the media appeal comes too late to stop the construction, the public responds sympathetically to the tanuki, pushing the developers to set aside some areas as parks. However, the parks are too small to accommodate all the non-transforming tanuki. Some try to survive there, dodging traffic to rummage through human scraps for food, while others disperse farther out to the countryside to compete with the tanuki who are already there.   In a touching [[Coda (music)|coda]], one day, Shoukichi, who also joined the human world, is coming home from work when he sees a non-transformed tanuki leaping into a gap in a wall. Shoukichi crawls into the gap and follows the path, which leads to a grassy clearing where some of his former companions are gathering. He joyfully transforms back into a tanuki to join them. In an emotional final scene, Shoukichi's friend, Ponkichi [[Fourth wall|addresses the viewer]], asking humans to be more considerate of tanuki and other animals less endowed with transformation skills, and not to destroy their living space; as the view pulls out and away, their surroundings are revealed as a golf course within a suburban sprawl.

Priest (1994 film)
 Father Greg Pilkington, newly assigned to St. Mary's parish in inner-city [[Liverpool]], is startled to discover Father Matthew Thomas is engaged in a sexual relationship with rectory housekeeper Maria Kerrigan. Moreover, Father Thomas is a left-wing radical and an outspoken proponent of [[Liberation Theology]], leading him to constant clashes and bickering with the Bishop—who nevertheless appreciates his abilities.  While the young protagonist's personal traditional conservatism and religious beliefs are offended by the older priest's blatant disregard for his vow of celibacy, he struggles with his own homosexual urges, especially after he meets Graham at a local gay hangout and the two embark on a physical relationship.  Meanwhile, student Lisa Unsworth has confided she was [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] by her father, who confirms her story and displays no guilt nor any desire to stop. Both have revealed their secret in the [[confessional]], however, so Father Greg is required to honour the sanctity of the [[Sacrament of Penance]] and not reveal what he has been told. He tries to warn her mother to keep a close watch on her, but the naive woman believes her daughter is safe while in the care of her husband.  When Mrs. Unsworth discovers her husband molesting Lisa and realises the priest knew what was happening, she lashes out at him. Adding to his torment is his arrest for having sex with Graham in a parked car. When he pleads guilty to the charge, the story is headlined on the front page of the local newspaper and, unable to face his parishioners, Father Greg relocates to a remote rural parish headed by a disapproving and unforgiving priest. Father Matthew convinces him to return to St. Mary's, and the two preside over a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] that is disrupted by the loud protests of those opposed to Father Greg's presence on the altar. Father Matthew demands they leave the church. The two priests then begin to distribute the [[Eucharist]], but the remaining parishioners ignore Father Greg and line up to receive communion from Father Matthew. Lisa finally approaches the younger priest, and the two fall into each other's arms sobbing.

When Irene is on an outing with Lootie, she runs away on purpose, and Lootie cannot find her. When sun sets, Irene is lost in a sinister forest, and is attacked when a clawed hands bursts through the earth and attempts to seize her kitten, Turnip. Several deformed animals corner the frightened Princess, until a strange singing sounds through the trees, driving them into a crazed and frightened fit, and they flee. The singing is revealed to be a young boy, Curdie, the son of a miner. He discovers Irene is lost, and leads her back to the castle. He informs her that the monsters were goblins and their "pets", and that they are driven away by singing. Curdie says that everyone except the King and his family know of the goblins, and Irene reveals she is a Princess.  The next day, Irene goes exploring in the castle after discovering a magical secret door in her bedroom. She ventures into a tower and meets the spirit of her Great Great Grandmother, also called Irene. Grandmother informs the young princess that she will be there to help her, for Irene will soon be in grave danger. The same day, Curdie and his father are underground in the mines, and Curdie falls through a pothole and into the realm of the goblins. Hidden, he follows the goblins to a vast cavern where the sniveling Goblin King and the malevolent Goblin Queen are holding an audience, announcing their scheme to flood the mines and drown the "Sun People"... humans. Suddenly, Prince Froglip, the feared, yet spoiled and infantile, heir to the goblin throne, announces drowning them is "Not enough!" and states he shall abduct the Princess of the Sun People and marry her, thereby forcing the humans to accept the goblins as their rulers. He claims that this is revenge for the humans exiling the goblins underground centuries beforehand. Before Curdie can run and tell the others, the goblins find him and put him away in a dungeon. Luckily, Irene and Turnip have snuck out of the castle again, following a magic thread given to her by her grandmother, invisible to everyone else.

All three are knocked down by the arrival of the flood waters and Curdie tries to rescue the princess and not get thrown over the battlement edges by the goblin prince. With some help from Irene, Froglip is flung away and everyone is saved.  
Pulp Fiction
 ''Pulp Fiction''&apos;s narrative is told out of chronological order, and follows three main interrelated stories: Mob [[Contract killing|contract killer]] Vincent Vega is the [[protagonist]] of the first story, prizefighter Butch Coolidge is the protagonist of the second, and Vincent's partner Jules Winnfield is the protagonist of the third.<ref name="PF93">"Pulp Fiction: The Facts" (1993 location interview), ''Pulp Fiction'' DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment).</ref>  The film begins with a diner hold-up staged by a couple, then moves to the stories of Vincent, Jules, and Butch. It finally returns to where it began, in the diner. There are a total of seven narrative sequences; the three primary storylines are preceded by intertitles: # "Prologue&nbsp;— The Diner" (i) # Prelude to "Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife" # "Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife" # Prelude to "The Gold Watch" (a&nbsp;— flashback, b&nbsp;— present) # "The Gold Watch" # "The Bonnie Situation" # "Epilogue&nbsp;— The Diner" (ii)  If the seven sequences were ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 4b, 3, 5. Sequences 1 and 7 partially overlap and are presented from different points of view, as do sequences 2 and 6. According to Philip Parker, the structural form is "an episodic narrative with circular events adding a beginning and end and allowing references to elements of each separate episode to be made throughout the narrative".<ref>Parker (2002), p. 23.</ref> Other analysts describe the structure as a "circular narrative".<ref>See, e.g., Dancyger (2002), p. 235; </ref>  ===Summary===  Hitmen Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace, from an associate, Brett. After Vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, Jules shoots one of Brett's associates, then declaims a passage from the Bible before he and Vincent kill Brett for trying to double-cross Marsellus. They take the briefcase to Marsellus, but have to wait while he bribes champion boxer Butch Coolidge to [[match fixing|take a dive]] in his upcoming match.  The next day, Vincent purchases [[heroin]] from his drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up, then drives to meet Marsellus's wife Mia, whom he agrees to escort while Marsellus is out of town. They eat at a 1950s-[[Theme restaurant|themed restaurant]] and participate in a [[Twist (dance)|twist]] contest, then return home with the trophy. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin, mistakes it for cocaine, snorts it, and overdoses. Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, where they revive her with an adrenaline shot to her heart.  Butch double-crosses Marsellus and wins the bout, accidentally killing his opponent. At the motel where he and his girlfriend Fabienne are lying low and preparing to flee town, Butch discovers she has forgotten to pack his father's gold watch, a beloved heirloom, and flies into a rage. Returning to his apartment to retrieve the watch, he notices a gun on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. Vincent exits the bathroom and Butch shoots him dead.  As Butch waits at a traffic light in his car, Marsellus spots him by chance and chases him into a pawnshop. The owner, Maynard, captures them at gunpoint and ties them up in the basement. Maynard is joined by Zed, a security guard; they take Marsellus to another room to rape him, leaving the "gimp", a silent figure in a [[bondage suit]], to watch Butch. Butch breaks loose and knocks out the gimp. He is about to flee but decides to save Marsellus, returning with a [[katana]] from the pawnshop. He kills Maynard; Marsellus retrieves Maynard's shotgun and shoots Zed. Marsellus informs Butch that they are even, as long as he tells no one about the rape and departs Los Angeles forever. Butch picks up Fabienne on Zed's [[Chopper (motorcycle)|chopper]].  Earlier, after Vincent and Jules have executed Brett in his apartment, another man bursts out of the bathroom and shoots at them wildly, missing every time; Jules and Vincent kill him. Jules decides their survival was a miracle, which Vincent disputes. As Jules drives, Vincent accidentally shoots Brett's associate Marvin in the face. They hide the car at the home of their associate Jimmie, who insists they deal with the problem before his wife comes home. Marsellus sends his [[Cleaner (crime)|cleaner]], Winston Wolfe, who directs Jules and Vincent to clean the car, hide the body in the trunk, dispose of their bloody clothes, and take the car to a junk yard.  At a diner, Jules tells Vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their "miraculous" survival at the apartment was a sign. While Vincent is in the bathroom, a couple, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, hold up the restaurant. Jules overpowers Pumpkin and holds him at gunpoint; Honey Bunny becomes hysterical and trains her gun on him. Vincent returns with his gun trained on her, creating a [[Mexican standoff]]. Jules recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave. Jules and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase.  
Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings
 In 1958 in Ferren Woods, a small backwater town, an old blind witch, Ms. Osie, feeds a deformed orphan named Tommy; he is the offspring of [[Pumpkinhead (character)|Pumpkinhead]]. As Tommy eats, a car of six teens pull up and notice him. Convinced that he is some demonic monster, they chase him with switchblade knives and baseball bats; eventually, they corner him at an old [[iron mine]], where they bludgeon him and drop him down into the mine, killing him.  Thirty-five years later, Sheriff Sean Braddock, his wife, and his daughter Jenny have come into town. Sean grew up in Ferren Woods and returned when offered a job as the local sheriff. Jenny has often gotten herself into a lot of trouble with the law, especially with her father, who was once a police officer.   At school, Jenny meets a group of wild kids, one of whom is Daniel "Danny" Dixon, whose dad was one of the teens who had taken part in Tommy's murder 35 years ago and has since become the town judge. The teens sneak off one night and pilfer Sean's car. Danny inadvertently hits Ms. Osie, and when they go to her cabin to check on her, they find a spellbook and vials of blood, which she is planning to use to resurrect Tommy. After Ms. Osie catches them, she orders them out. Danny knocks her down and escapes with a vial of blood.  Danny and his friends attempt to resurrect Tommy's corpse. Jenny notices Ms. Osie's cabin on fire and Danny and his friends flee. Ms. Osie is badly burnt and ends up in the hospital. Unbeknownst to Danny and his friends, the spell they'd attempted worked, resurrecting Tommy in the form of Pumpkinhead. Soon, Judge Dixon's friends begin to meet grisly deaths.   Jenny's father investigates and begins to come to terms with the fact that Tommy is responsible for the murders. Ms. Osie dies, but not before revealing to Sean some clues. Sean discovers the connection between the victims and Pumpkinhead, realizing that the judge is next.  Judge Dixon calls his [[Posse comitatus|posse]] to assist him in killing whatever is murdering his friends. Before they can arrive however, Pumpkinhead brutally murders Judge Dixon. Now that Tommy has avenged his own death, he begins going after Danny and his friends (for fleeing instead of helping Ms. Osie). Sean and the town doctor go into the woods to find Jenny. By this time, Pumpkinhead (Tommy) has murdered Danny and his 3 friends.   He then chases Jenny to the iron mine. Since Sean had saved his life years earlier as a boy, and because Jenny was innocent of hurting Ms. Osie, Tommy allows Jenny to step down to her father safe and sound. However, the judge's posse arrives and shoots Tommy back into the mine, where he had died 35 years earlier. Jenny later apologizes to her father for all the trouble she caused. Just then, Sean finds an old toy fire truck near the mineshaft that he gave to Tommy as a gift for saving his life.  
The Puppet Masters (film)
 When a flying saucer reportedly lands in rural Iowa, The Old Man (who runs a secret branch of the CIA), decides to investigate. He goes in person, accompanied by agents Sam (who is the son of The Old Man) and Jarvis, as well as Dr. Mary Sefton, a NASA specialist in alien biology. They find that aliens have indeed landed and are planning to use their mind-control powers to take over our planet. The aliens are slug-like creatures, and they are attaching themselves to people's backs, taking control of their victims' nervous systems, and manipulating those people as puppets.  The slugs spread steadily, and soon attack one of the agents, Sam. Controlling Sam, aliens almost possess the president, too, but are defeated by the agents. Agents then learn they can remove a slug by an electric shock, and free Sam from the possession of a slug. It is soon found out all slugs share a common consciousness, a sort of a group mind.  The aliens quickly reproduce by division, soon controlling not only most of the population of the infested area, but also military personnel sent to the area to fight them.  As agents learn where the aliens' "hive" is located, they attempt to sneak in, and release Mary, whom aliens captured earlier. Together, they find surviving people whom slugs couldn't possess. They take one of them, a boy, with them, leaving the hive.  It is soon found out the boy suffered from [[encephalitis]] in the past, and that apparently was the reason a slug couldn't possess him. A biological warfare is adopted, and seemingly all parasites die. During a later inspection of a hive, The Old Man is attacked by the last healthy slug. In a fight on a helicopter, Sam destroys the parasite attached to the body of his father.  
Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter
 Following the events of [[Puppet Master 4|the previous film]], Rick Myers has been [[arrested]] under the suspicion of having caused the murders of Dr. Piper and Baker, but Dr. Jennings, the new director of the [[Artificial Intelligence]] research project and Rick's temporary superior, gets him out on [[bail]]. Blade has been confiscated, but he escapes from the police department's evidence room and jumps into Susie's purse as she comes to fetch Rick. Lauren lies comatose in the hospital following the events in the inn. Meanwhile, in the underworld, Sutekh decides to take matters into his own hands and infuses his life essence into his own Totem figure.  While Jennings professes [[scepticism]] toward Rick's story, he becomes actually quite interested in acquiring Toulon's [[secret]], especially since the project's unofficial sponsors are luring with a sizeable contribution, should he succeed in presenting a prototype soon. Jennings returns to the [[Hotel Green|Bodega Bay Inn]] with three hired thugs - Tom Hendy, Jason, and Scott - to collect the puppets and the formula, but in the meantime Rick is roused by a [[nightmare]] and finds Blade by his side. Sensing that something is about to happen, Rick and Blade depart for the [[hotel]]. Susie, while paying a visit to Lauren, witnesses her friend receiving a vision of [[Set (deity)|Sutekh]] and his [[Totem]]. Unable to contact Rick, she proceeds to the hotel as well.  While searching the building, Jason and Hendy are ambushed and killed by Sutekh, and Scott encounters and is knocked out by Pinhead and Jester. Jennings also encounters Sutekh but is saved by Torch and Six-Shooter; and the puppets start fighting back against Sutekh. Rick goes back to his room and runs into Suzie, but they both get locked in by Sutekh's powers. Through his computer, Rick gets in contact with Lauren, who tells him to activate The Decapitron. Jennings enters the room and tries to convince Rick to collect the puppets and leave the hotel. In the meantime, Scott recovers, but is also found and slain by Sutekh.  Jester enters the room and leads Rick to where the Decapitron is hidden. Rick, Suzie and Jennings proceed to revive Decapitron, and [[Andre Toulon|Toulon]] advises them to leave the hotel while the puppets will engage Sutekh. Jennings, however, insists on taking one of the puppets with him, despite Rick and Suzie's warnings. Rick, Suzie, and Jennings take the elevator down, but then Jennings attacks and knocks out Rick, while Suzie is pushed out of the cabin. But when Jennings exits the elevator, he is stopped by Decapitron and the other puppets, who force him back to the elevator shaft. With the cabin already gone and the door secretly opened by Pinhead, Jennings falls to his death.  Sutekh corners Rick and Suzie, but Decapitron shows up, allowing them to escape. The puppets engage Sutekh, who fights back; but having stayed too long in the mortal world, the demon's essence has become vulnerable, and his power wanes. In desperation, Sutekh attempts to escape back into the underworld by opening a portal, but Decapitron fires [[electron]] bolts at it, overloading the conduit and causing it to explode, destroying Sutekh.  Rick takes the puppets back home to repair and care for them. Toulon speaks with Rick one final time, again entrusting his puppets and their secret to him while they will continue to act as his protectors.

Ganga dies in hospital with a suicide note written by Ravi, but Ganga was illiterate. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.  
Quiz Show (film)
 In 1958, the questions and answers to be used for the latest broadcast of [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]'s popular quiz show ''[[Twenty-One (game show)|Twenty-One]]'' are transported from a secure bank vault to the studio. The evening's main attraction is [[Queens]] resident [[Herb Stempel]] ([[John Turturro]]), the reigning champion, who correctly answers question after question. However, both the network and the program's corporate sponsor, the supplementary tonic [[Geritol]], find that Stempel's approval ratings are beginning to level out, meaning the show would benefit from new talent.  Producers [[Dan Enright]] ([[David Paymer]]) and Albert Freedman ([[Hank Azaria]]) are surprised when [[Columbia University]] instructor [[Charles Van Doren]] ([[Ralph Fiennes]]), son of a prominent literary family, visits their office to audition. Realizing that they have found an ideal challenger for Stempel, they offer to ask the same questions during the show which Van Doren correctly answered during his audition. He refuses, but when he comes within reach of a game-winning 21 points on the show, he is asked one of the questions from his audition. After a moment of moral indecision, he gives the correct answer. Stempel, having been promised a future on television if he takes a dive, deliberately misses his chance at reaching 21 by incorrectly answering one of the show's easiest questions.  In the weeks that follow, Van Doren's winning streak makes him a national celebrity, but he buckles under the pressure and allows Enright and Freedman to start giving him the answers. Meanwhile, Stempel, having lost his prize money to an unscrupulous [[bookie]], begins threatening legal action against NBC after weeks go by without his return to television.  He visits New York County District Attorney [[Frank Hogan]], who convenes a [[grand jury]] to look into his allegations.  [[Richard N. Goodwin|Richard Goodwin]] ([[Rob Morrow]]), a young [[United States Congress|Congressional]] lawyer, learns that the grand jury findings have been sealed and travels to New York City to investigate rumors of rigged quiz shows. Visiting a number of contestants, including Stempel and Van Doren, he begins to suspect that ''Twenty-One'' is a fixed operation. However, Stempel's volatile personality damages his credibility, and nobody else seems willing to confirm that the show is fixed. Fearing Goodwin will give up the investigation, Stempel confesses that he was fed the correct answers during his run on the show, and insists that Van Doren must have been involved as well. Another former contestant gives Goodwin quiz show answers he mailed to himself by registered post two days before the show, presumably as blackmail against Enright and Freedman.  Van Doren deliberately loses. He is rewarded by NBC with a lucrative contract to appear as a special correspondent on the morning ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show. The House Committee for Legislative Oversight convenes a hearing, at which Goodwin presents his evidence of the quiz show's corruption.   During the hearing, Stempel's testimony fails to convince the committee. Both NBC network head [[Robert Kintner]] ([[Allan Rich]]) and Geritol executive Martin Rittenhome ([[Martin Scorsese]]) deny any knowledge of ''Twenty-One'' being rigged. After being subpoenaed by Goodwin, Van Doren testifies before the committee and admits his role in the deception. After the hearing adjourns, he learns from reporters that he has been fired from ''Today'' and that Columbia's trustees are going to ask for his resignation.  Goodwin believes he is on the verge of a victory against Geritol and NBC, but realizes that Enright and Freedman will not jeopardize their own futures in television by turning against their bosses. He silently watches the producers' testimony, vindicating the sponsors and the network from any wrongdoing, and taking full responsibility for rigging the show.  
Radioland Murders
  In 1939, a new [[radio network]] based at station WBN in [[Chicago]], Illinois, begins its inaugural night. The station's owner, [[General officer|General]] Walt Whalen, depends on his employees to impress main sponsor Bernie King. This includes writer Roger Henderson, assistant director Penny Henderson (Roger's wife, seeking divorce), [[page (occupation)|page]] boy Billy Budget, engineer Max Applewhite, [[conducting|conductor]] Rick Rochester, announcer Dexter Morris, director Walt Whalen, Jr. and stage manager Herman Katzenback. After King commissions rewrites on the radio scripts, the WBN writers get angry, adding to the fact that they have not been paid in weeks.  When Ruffles Reedy, a trumpet player, falls dead from [[rodenticide|rat poison]]ing, a series of events ensue. Director Walt Jr. is hanged (the mysterious killer makes it look like a suicide), and his father, the General, has the [[Chicago Police Department]] (CPD) get involved to solve the murder mysteries as the nightly radio performance continues. Herman Katzenback is then killed after attempting to fix the main stage when the machinery malfunctions. Penny is appointed both stage manager and director due to Walt Jr. and Katzenback's deaths. Writer Roger Henderson tries to solve the killings, much to the annoyance of the police, led by Lieutenant Cross.  Because Roger unfortunately appears at every scene of crime just as the murders take place, he is ruled as the prime suspect. Roger and Billy Budget then theorize that announcer Dexter Morris is the next to die. Dexter ignores their warning and is killed by electrocution. By going through private documents in WBN's file room, Roger finds that the victims all previously worked together at a radio station in [[Peoria, Illinois]], which he then correlates into a secretive [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] scandal. King (laughing gas) and General Whalen (falls down an elevator shaft) are the next to die after Roger's warning, causing even more suspicion from the police.  After escaping from custody, Roger uses Billy to communicate and send scripts to Penny. When rewriting one of the programs, ''Gork: Son of Fire'', Roger attempts to write the script with [[self-reference|self-referential]] events, proving to everyone that the mysterious killer is actually sound engineer Max Applewhite. Max explains that his killings were a revenge scheme that dealt with stock holders and patents, specifically detailing his invention of television, which other scientists have copied. Roger and Penny are taken by Max atop the radio tower at gunpoint. Max is eventually killed when a [[biplane]] shows up and guns him down. Impressed by the nightly performance, the sponsors decide to fund WBN. Roger and Penny reconcile their complex relationship and decide not to divorce.

He is not motivated by money or desire for worldly success; he spends a great deal of time observing marine creatures at the local marine life observation station, and successfully defends his right (against the landlady) to have a small aquarium in the rented apartment. He also earns a significant paycheck by writing radio advertisements, but that sort of work repels him. Urged by his brother to get a job, he becomes a lifeguard at the municipal swimming pool.  In flashback scenes the audience learns that the boys used to spend pleasant summers at a Wisconsin lake with their family, often swimming across the lake for sport. The final such summer ended in tragedy - Michael had been busy with his career by then and was not at the lake; Matthew and his father began swimming across the lake but the father suffered cramps midway and drowned despite Matthew's frantic efforts to save him.  Much of the film is devoted to Matthew's inner thoughts, including his conversations and visits with Jesus.  Matthew tells us at the film's beginning that his stream-of-consciousness thoughts are like having a radio inside, with the dial being constantly tuned across the spectrum of available stations.  Michael is dating a girl, Natalie, and is considering asking her hand in marriage. However, he is often insensitive to her emotional needs, a fact which his younger brother recognizes and tries to help with.  Matthew then becomes emotionally attached to Natalie, but finally realizes that in order to keep his brother, he must give Natalie up, much as he gave up his father. The heaviness of this realization drives him to a suicide attempt. He concludes that God wants people to give everything to God, at least everything they value dearly.  
The Quality of Mercy (film)
  The movie starts on a morning in January 1945. The spectator is advised of the real events on which the movie is based. The first pictures show images of the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]], and afterwards the inside of barrack 20 – the “death block” – is shown. 500 Russian soldiers, who have refused to fight for Germany after being arrested, sleep on the floor. Then the wake-up-call rings. Having been put on a harsh diet, many get up only laboriously, while some are completely unable to do so any more.  Among the prisoners of war who crawl outside onto the courtyard are also the Russian officers Michail and Nikolai, whose destiny serves as the central thread in the movie. It is winter, and the men, who are dressed much too lightly, try to warm each other. Then a stone falls down the wall. There is a message is wrapped around it: ''Block 20 shall be cleared in a month!''  ===The breakout=== Due to their hopeless situation, a planned breakout is carried out in one of the following days. The prisoners overpower the [[Kapo (Arbeitslager)|Kapo]]s, construct shoes and weapons out of blankets and other items and say goodbye to those who are too weak for the escape. Afterwards they leave the barracks. While the tower guards are distracted with fire extinguishers and missiles, tables and chairs are piled up in front of the walls. Only 150 of the 500 manage to escape into the night, among whom are Michail and Nikolai. The majority, however, dies in the confines of the camp.  The sirens which resound from the camp wake up the neighbourhood at half past three in the morning. Among the inhabitants of the area is the Karner family. The people streaming out of their houses are informed by the [[SS]] that 500 “felons” have escaped from the camp and have fled North. All available men from [[Volkssturm]], [[Wehrmacht]] on holidays, [[Gendarmerie (Austria)|gendarmerie]] and [[Hitler Youth]] would have to participate in the chase. The felons are not to be arrested, but rather killed on the spot.  In the next few minutes, the attitude of many inhabitants of the region becomes clear. Fredl Karner, who is unfit for military service due to [[amblyopia]], looks the other way when he sees three of the fleeing Russians on the very spot where the SS leader has just delivered his speech. Gendarme Binder also disapproves of the chase, as the felons would not do him any harm. The instructions to his group are unmistakable: ''“None of us will see or hear them, much less arrest them.”'' Thus, he is in direct opposition to everyone who is eagerly taking part in the chase.  ===The manhunt=== At dawn, the chase starts. As Mrs Karner makes her way to church, a couple of refugees run out of the forest, the chasers close on their heels. Her son Fredl is also part of the group which kills the refugees in full view of Mrs. Karner and her little daughter. Fredl will witness many such dreadful killings in the next few hours.  Eventually, Fredl’s group also catches one of the prisoners alive. Nobody can bear the thought of shooting him, so they decide that Fredl and another man will take him to the SS. On the way, they witness the execution of a couple of captured prisoners and turn around with their prisoner. Hours later, they are still wandering around with him, not knowing what to do. Finally they decide to let him go. Fredl gives the prisoner his jacket, and the other one gives him a piece of bread, but just as Fredl starts to take off his shoes, the SS appears and shoots the Russian.  Michail and Nikolai have meanwhile hid in the church steeple with their friend Andrej. From there they watch their colleagues being rounded up. While searching for food, they are seen by the grocer Lehmberger, who shoots at them. Another passerby simply ignores them. They come to a hall which is used for movie screenings and other events. In a room above the hall, hay is stored. In that room, they hide under the hay until a peasant woman comes and takes away some of it with a pitchfork, badly injuring the hidden Michail in the process. When all is clear, they leave the storage room. On the run, they are separated from Andrej, who is shot.  Eventually they come to the farm of the Karner family. While Nikolai goes to sleep in the hayloft, Michail’s search for food drives him to the courtyard. Despite the objections of her husband and worries expressed by Fredl, Mrs Karner welcomes him and gives him a hot meal. Mitzi, the daughter of the house, brings clothes and shoes, whereupon Michail burns his workwear. Afterwards they bring clothes and food to Nikolai, who is hiding in the hayloft.  In order to protect his family, Fredl continues to participate in the chase, which has meanwhile been named the “bunny hunt”. In the meantime, Gendarme Birker has accommodated some of the refugees in the local jail. Lehmberger, however, discovers them and propels them onto the courtyard, where he shoots them in front of the helpless gendarme.  On the way to the church service, which Mrs Karner attends as usual with her youngest daughter Nanni, the two come across some Nazi soldiers who are walking in the direction of their farm. She sends her daughter back to warn Mitzi so that the two girls can hide the Russians in a better place. The house search is unsuccessful; however, this is not the case everywhere.  In the countryside, Fredl and Berghammer are on the chase. When Berghammer wanders off for a few minutes, Fredl sees a refugee hiding under a footbridge. Moved with compassion, he offers a warm drink to the Russian. However, Berghammer discovers them and insists that they take him prisoner. Despite Fredl's protests, he cannot be softened. They deliver the prisoner to the SS. When Fredl is told by the SS leader to shoot him, he refuses. Berghammer takes care of it instead. Gendarme Birker must then arrest Fredl and take him to the [[Gestapo]] in [[Linz]]; however, he is eventually released. Afterwards, Fredl hides with Michail and Nikolai in the attic on the farm.  ===The aftermath=== One after another, the fugitives are found. Most are shot, but many of the prisoners freeze or starve to death in the harsh winter.  Spring is coming, and the ''hasenjagd'' is nearly forgotten. Michail and Nikolai even work at the farm. Then the war ends. Nobody cares that Berghammer has discovered in the end that the two Russians were hiding at the Karner’s place. They are much more concerned about destroying incriminating files and uniforms. Lehmberger is found hanging in his store.  It is explained in the closing credits that just nine of the 500 Russian soldiers are known to have survived (from a total of 11 escapees who survived the chase without capture). Michail and Nikolai go home. Today, they live in the former Soviet Union.  After the credits, a final scene shows a courtroom. The judge renders judgment upon the mayor of the village in which the ''Hasenjagd'' has taken place. He has been indicted for inciting the villagers to hunt the prisoners down. Due to many conflicting testimonies, the mayor is acquitted, though the court remains unconvinced of his innocence.  
Rapa-Nui (film)
 There are two classes of people: [[hanau epe|Long Ears]] and Short Ears. Long Ears, marked by large wooden plugs in their earlobes and a certain tattoo, are the ruling class. The working-class Short Ears have no ear plugs and a different tattoo. Young men from each Long Ear tribe compete in the annual Birdman Competition. The winner’s tribe gets to rule the island for a year.  Ariki-mau has been the Birdman (Island King) for 20 years. He has a conviction that one day the gods will arrive in a great white canoe and take him to heaven. His advisor tells him to build more and bigger [[moai]] statues to curry favor with the gods and encourage them to come sooner. Ariki-mau petulantly rejects the latest statue—which stands over 20 feet tall—as too small. The Short Ear workers are forced to build an even bigger statue in an impossibly short amount of time. The king’s advisor ruthlessly enforces the rules and status quo by publicly killing a Short Ear fisherman who had accidentally caught a [[taboo]] fish.  Long Ear Noro ([[Jason Scott Lee]]) and Ramana, a Short Ear, are both rejects in their tribes—her father was banished for building an unlucky canoe. Noro’s father stole a canoe and sailed away and is accused of abandoning the tribe. They have a secret relationship and have fallen in love.  Ariki-mau tells Noro that he has to compete in the Birdman Competition so Ariki-mau can continue to rule the island. Noro asks if he can marry Ramana if he wins the Birdman Competition. The king reluctantly agrees. The king’s advisor claims that Ramana's skin is too dark and that she should be purified by spending the time from now until the Birdman Competition (six months) in the "Virgin’s Cave". He checks her virginity and snidely remarks to Noro, who is watching Ramana being lowered to the cave, that she isn’t right for the Virgin’s Cave and that it will be their secret. Ramana takes one last look at the sunset and goes into the cave.  Noro approaches Ramana’s banished father, a canoe maker, and asks him to help him train for the Birdman competition. He initially refuses, because it is Noro’s fault that his daughter is confined to a cave, but later relents and trains Noro. While training Noro he explains that he and Noro's father were great friends once and that he gave the canoe to Noro's father. He further explains that Noro's father sailed away after discovering a piece of a shipwrecked Spanish galleon, thus breaking the long-held belief that Rapa Nui is the only land left with people on the Earth.  Meanwhile, the Short Ears are beginning to starve because the king insists on them working on the new statue instead of growing food but continues taking the full quota of their remaining food for the Long Ears. The resources of the island are being rapidly used up and depleted (with the last remaining tree being cut down), due to the extensive Moai construction and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]. Noro is the only person worried about the resource depletion, but his concerns are dismissed by the increasingly senile Ariki-mau.  Noro sneaks some food to his Short Ear friend Make (Esai Morales) and shares his plans to marry Ramana. Make reacts badly and Noro realizes that Make loves her, too. Make declares that they are no longer friends and runs off. Separately, Noro and Make visit Ramana at her cave, bringing her food and talking to her through the barrier at the mouth of the cave. They both declare their love to her. She always responds, but she sounds despondent.  After a supply shortage results in the death of one of the Short Ears (Heki, the former master carver), they demand half of the wood, food and other materials and that they be allowed to compete in the Birdman Competition. The King's advisor initially refuses and orders their death. However, the King gives in to their demands after realizing that if the Short Ears die no one will build the moai. The King, however, only allows them to compete after the moai has been completed. He makes the condition that if the Short Ear competitor loses he will be sacrificed. Despite these conditions Make accepts the position of the Birdman Competitor on the condition he be allowed to marry Ramana if he wins. The King agrees and Make spends all his time working and training, leaving no time for sleep or other recreational activities. Meanwhile, work on the great Moai has become so important that the Short Ears sacrifice their food to complete it.  Finally it is the Birdman Competition. Nine competitors must swim to a close-by islet surrounded by pounding surf, climb the cliffs to get an egg from the nest of a sooty tern and bring it back. The first to return wins for his tribe. Noro barely wins and Ariki-mau gets to be the island's ruler for another year.  Ramana is brought from the cave, pale from her long underground stay and very pregnant. Before anything is decided about the fate of Ramana or Make, an iceberg is spotted off the coast. Ariki-mau believes that the iceberg is the great white canoe sent to take him to the gods and goes out to it with some of his followers. After the iceberg has carried Ariki-mau away, the advisor attempts to seize control of the island, but Make kills him and the Short Ears stage a rebellion, slaughtering and even eating the remains of the Long Ears. Noro alone survives, as Make allows him to live, and Noro, Ramana and their baby escape the island in a canoe Ramana’s father built.   An after-movie credit states that archaeological evidence proves that [[Pitcairn]] Island was settled some 1,500 miles away, providing hope that Noro, Ramana and their daughter made it to a new land.  
Raja Babu (film)
 Raja Babu ([[Govinda (actor)|Govinda]]) is a poor orphan adopted by a wealthy village couple ([[Kader Khan]] and [[Aruna Irani]]). He is a typical country bumpkin, good-hearted but lacking in urban manners. His vanity, not discouraged by his mother's doting, leads him to have his photograph taken often at the village photo studio, each time in a different outfit. He is always accompanied by his sidekick Nandu, ([[Shakti Kapoor]]).   He falls for Madhu ([[Karishma Kapoor]]) when he sees her photograph in the studio. In a fantasy dance sequence, her photograph makes his motorcycle come to life by itself, and it chases her decorated with plastic flowers.  A careless stunt by Nandu sees Madhu enter the village with her entourage. A neighbor is blamed, and the entourage arrests him and takes him back into their village. The main antagonist of the film, played by [[Prem Chopra]], sends his goons to attack, but a cleverly disguised Raja and Nandu thwart the attackers with impressive swashbuckling derring-do.  Taken in by his smart appearance and impressive talk, Madhu reciprocates his love, but walks out on him with all the villagers watching when she learns that he is no match to her urbane, well-educated self. It was particularly humiliating for his father as it happened in front of villagers who respected him highly.  Raja still wants to marry Madhu, even though the latter humiliated his father. However, he finds out that he is not his parents' biological son, but was in fact adopted. He is overcome with gratitude and decides to forget Madhu. His father arranges his marriage with a mentally disabled girl. Raja agrees, since he doesn't want to do anything to upset his father. In the meantime, Madhu decides that she has fallen in love with Raja and starts to pursue him. Raja tells her that he is no longer interested in her, but she refuses to listen. Meanwhile, Raja's evil uncle has been planning to kill his family and take control of their property. Raja's father eventually throws him out of the house because he thinks he is still involved with Madhu. Taking advantage of this, the evil uncle and his son kidnap Raja's parents. However, Raja rescues them and they agree to his marriage with Madhu.  
The Rapeman
 [[File:Therapemanmovie.jpg|thumb|left|Poster for the second film of the live-action film series]]The main character, Keisuke Iwasaki (岩崎 圭介 ''Iwasaki Keisuke''), is a handsome and very muscular high school teacher by day and dispenses a surreal brand of "justice" at night as the Rapeman under the business "Rapeman Services", which is co-run with his uncle, a former surgeon. The business' motto is: "Righting wrongs through penetration."<ref>[http://www.manchesterconfidential.co.uk/Culture/Architecture/Manga-chester_3913.asp Manchester Confidential: Manga-Chester]</ref> Clients call on the Rapeman to handle cases such as the revenge of a jilted lover, forming parental bonds through a traumatic crisis, making disruptive co-workers more docile and other things of that nature. When engaged in his night trade, the Rapeman wears a black leather ski mask shaped like the head of a penis, but no trousers or underwear. In the middle of a rape, if the woman becomes unresponsive or expresses enjoyment, he uses special techniques such as "M69 Screwdriver" or "Infinite Loop" to apply more pain to the victim. Despite regretting some of the contracts he fulfills, he always completes the task.  
Rampo (film)
  In an animated introduction a man hides in a [[nagamochi]] while playing hide and seek with neighboring children, but he is locked in and can hardly breathe. When his wife comes home he manages to make a noise and she opens the lid to the trunk, and instead shuts it again.  We now then enter a live action world where [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]-inspired mystery writer Edogawa Rampo ([[Naoto Takenaka]]) has written a book about a woman who has killed her husband by locking him in a nagamochi. The book is banned by the government who claim the work to be too disturbing. He is asked to burn his manuscript. However, after burning his paper drafts, his publisher shows him a newspaper story with an account of events just like his forbidden story. After spying on the woman concerned, who is labeled as a murderer, he decides to visit her store. Shizuko ([[Michiko Hada]]) offers him her own music box for free as he has showed interest in it. He later stalks her to a shrine where he admits following her and she asks him to go away. She later asks him to meet her at the shrine. She's sorry and has read his book and was impressed while he again excuses for his stalking behaviour. She is then picked up by a taxi and he avidly follows her with another taxi.<br>  Here his younger literary alter ego Kogoro Akechi ([[Masahiro Motoki]]) picks up the story. Akechi finds out Shizuko has an affair with a duke in a [[Dracula]]-like castle located at the sea on a cliff. He decides to pay this duke a secret visit by "experimenting" with parachute jumping. He lands in a pack of biting hunting dogs the duke directs at him. The duke sucks out his arm wound and then invites him home to treat the wound. They have dinner together and here he sees Shizuko serving him an aphrodisiac. Akeshi observes the duke while he's horse-riding, cross-dressing and smearing his facial make up all over her naked back and projecting a stag film on her body.  During an evening party he frightens the guests with a recital of a text of Poe - accompanied with images of war: the film gets stuck at the end of the text, burning the film depicting the face of a corpse. The next day he follows with another piece of "entertainment" by committing suicide with his white horse, running off the cliff.<br>  Edogawa Rampo returns to the story as he finds out about the castle and tries to enter the room where Akeshi is willingly - he needs no instructions from his writer - entering the nagamochi Shizuko has opened from him. As Rampo navigates through the castle the layers of fantasy and reality start to merge into one cosmic flashback occurring before and after he gets into the room where Shizuko commits suicide before Akeshi can get out of the nagamochi. Rampo holds Shizuko in his arms.

Reality Bites
 Four friends who recently graduated from college live together in Houston, Texas. Coffee-house guitarist Troy Dyer and budding filmmaker Lelaina Pierce are attracted to each other, although they have not acted on their feelings except for one brief, drunken encounter. Troy is floundering, having lost several minimum wage jobs—the last of which he loses early in the film for stealing a candy bar from his employer. Lelaina was valedictorian of her university and has aspirations to become a documentarian, although initially having to settle for a position as production assistant to a rude and obnoxious TV host.  Lelaina meets Michael Grates when she throws a cigarette into his [[Convertible (car)|convertible]], causing him to crash into her car. The two soon begin to date. He works at an [[MTV]]-like cable channel called "In Your Face" as an executive, and after learning about a documentary she's been working on, wants to get it aired on his network.  Lelaina's roommate Vickie has a series of [[one-night stand]]s and short relationships with dozens of guys; her promiscuity leads her to confront a very-real risk of contracting [[HIV]] after a former fling tests positive for the virus. Vickie works as a sales associate for [[The Gap (clothing retailer)|The Gap]], and is later promoted to manager and seems content with her new job. Her friend Sammy Gray is gay; he remains [[Celibacy|celibate]], not because of a fear of AIDS, but because forming a relationship would force him to [[Coming out|come out]] to his conservative parents.  After an impulsive act of retribution, Lelaina loses her job, which causes some tension with her roommates. Eventually, Vickie's AIDS test comes back negative and Sammy comes out to his parents (and he even starts dating) and the two manage to resume their lives.  Meanwhile, Lelaina's relationship with Michael dissolves after he helps her sell the documentary to his network, only to let them edit it into a stylized montage that she feels compromises her artistic vision. Lelaina and Troy then sleep together and confess their love. The morning after, he avoids her, and after a messy confrontation, leaves town. After Troy's father dies, he forces himself to reevaluate his life, deciding to attempt a relationship with Lelaina.  Troy and Lelaina reunite and make amends after Troy returns from his father's funeral in Chicago. While we do not see what happens to Michael, during the credits there is an abrupt break where two characters, "Laina" and "Roy", who are obvious parodies of Lelaina and Troy, have an argument about their relationship. As the "show's" credits roll, Michael's name is revealed as the producer, implying that he has turned the failed relationship into the subject of a new show on his network.

Mace figures out that Mitch has been framed by Deputy Mayor Bob Jenkins ([[Stacy Keach]]), who had Donna killed so he could steal a disc from her computer, fill it with false accusations of incest, then use the disc to blackmail Mayor Stiles into refusing to run for office again, because Jenkins is tired of playing second fiddle to Mayor Stiles. Atkins has been working for Jenkins.  Jenkins admits to Mayor Stiles that Jenkins is the mastermind behind Donna's murder as Atkins pursues Mace, Mitch and Sarah across the bayou, finally cornering them in a clip joint, where Mace uses a giant dart to kill Atkins.

Jenkins shoots Mayor Stiles in the shoulder, and a helicopter arrives for Jenkins, who releases Mayor Stiles and gets on the helicopter.

Renaissance Man (film)
 Bill Rago (DeVito) is a divorced advertising executive down on his luck. When he loses his job in [[Detroit]], the unemployment agency finds him a temporary job: teaching basic literacy classes at a nearby [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] training base, Fort McClane.  Initially unenthusiastic, Rago finds that he has only six weeks to teach a group of DD's - 'Dumb Dawgs', the basics of comprehension and use of English language. Most of the soldiers are only semi-literate and equally unenthusiastic.  Unable to connect with his pupils and desperate to spark their interest, Rago quotes from his favorite play, ''[[Hamlet]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]]. They are unfamiliar with it (or even the concept of a "play") and a small initial spark of interest is generated. He casts each student as a character in a classroom reading, then takes everyone on a field trip across the [[Blue Water Bridge]] to [[Stratford, Ontario]], Canada, to a live performance by [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespearean]] actors. He introduces them to Shakespeare's ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' as well.  In the meantime he takes steps to mend bridges with his daughter by buying her an airline ticket to [[Mexico]] - as well as buying her a [[Newtonian Telescope]] - so that she can start on the path to becoming a professional [[astronomer]].  Despite the disapproval of their hard-as-nails Drill Sergeant Cass (Hines), and the loss of one of the trainees, Pvt. Hobbs, who is revealed as a drug dealer hiding under an assumed identity, Rago sets an end-of-term oral examination. Even the friendly Capt. Murdoch in charge of the project doesn't expect the soldiers to pass Rago's class, adding that if they fail, they will be discharged from the Army.  Hobbs writes a letter to Rago and Murdoch, whose letters to the prison warden may result in him getting an early parole.  Hobbs says he read ''[[Othello]]'' in the prison library (the librarian said he was the first inmate in 16 years to request Shakespeare) and was thinking about taking college classes once he's released.  While on duty, on a dare from Cass in front of other men, one of the soldiers recites the [[St. Crispin's Day Speech]] by King Henry V while in full combat gear in the middle of a rainstorm during a night exercise; the speech moves even the hardened Sgt. Cass. The students then all pass Rago's class, with flying colors.  Rago meets and dates Marie, a soldier in the records department, who helps him do some investigation before the base's graduation ceremony. It results in one of his students being presented with the [[Silver Star]] medal his father was to have been awarded posthumously, after he was killed in [[Vietnam]].  As the proud soldiers march at their graduation parade, Rago is saluted by his "graduates." He signs on to continue teaching soldiers-in-training.

Still yearning for adventures, Aladdin foils the robbery of a group of criminals led by Abis Mal, stealing their loot and returning it to the people of Agrabah. Meanwhile, in the desert, Iago escapes from Jafar's lamp and refuses to heed Jafar's demands to free him too, instead throwing the lamp into a well and returning to Agrabah, hoping to get close to Aladdin and return to the palace. During a confrontation with Aladdin and Abu, the three are attacked by Abis Mal and his men, and Iago inadvertently saves Aladdin's life. In gratitude, Aladdin keeps Iago on the palace grounds, promising to speak with the Sultan on his behalf.  Abis Mal accidentally finds and takes possession of Jafar after finding his lamp in the well. Hindered by his incompetent master, Jafar manipulates Abis Mal into wasting his first two wishes, and enlists his help in taking revenge on Aladdin in exchange for granting him a special third wish. Abis Mal, still desiring revenge on Aladdin, agrees. At the palace, the Genie returns after seeing the world, having missed his friends greatly, and at the evening banquet the Sultan announces his intention to make Aladdin his new [[grand vizier]]. Iago is revealed, however, when Abu and Rajah chase him into the banquet. Aladdin desperately speaks up for Iago and convinces the Sultan to spare him, but Jasmine is left heartbroken that Aladdin did not confide in her. Genie and Iago help them reconcile, and Jasmine agrees to give Iago a chance.  As Iago begins to grow fond of Aladdin, Jafar sneaks into the palace with Abis Mal's help and confronts him, coercing him into helping him take revenge on Aladdin. Iago reluctantly agrees and arranges a trip for Aladdin and Sultan to a waterfall. Jafar captures Genie and Abu and then goes for Sultan, locking them all in the dungeon and framing Aladdin for the Sultan's alleged murder by posing as Jasmine, sentencing him to execution. Iago has a change of heart and frees the Genie, enabling him to save Aladdin in time. Though Agrabah is now under Jafar's control, Aladdin vows to stop him by destroying his lamp, the only way to kill Jafar, while Iago decides to leave altogether.  Aladdin and the group confront Jafar in the treasure room just before Abis Mal can wish him free. In the ensuing fight, Jafar transforms into his Genie form, incapacitates the Genie, shatters Carpet and traps Aladdin in a pool of lava. Iago intervenes and grabs the lamp; he is severely injured by Jafar, but stays conscious long enough to kick the lamp into the lava, destroying it and Jafar once and for all. Aladdin rescues Iago, and they all get to safety as Jafar's magic is undone, restoring Carpet. With Jafar gone, Iago is accepted into the palace, but Aladdin ultimately declines the Sultan's offer to become Vizier, instead opting to see the world with Jasmine, to Iago's chagrin.  A post-credits scene reveals Abis Mal to have survived, albeit stuck in a tree and finally realizing that his third wish will never be granted.  
The Ref
 In a charming Connecticut village, Lloyd and Caroline Chasseur ([[Kevin Spacey]] and [[Judy Davis]]) are in marriage counseling on Christmas Eve; the session doesn't go well and their problems become evident. Caroline has had an affair, and Lloyd is miserable and blames the problems with their 14-year-old son, Jesse ([[Robert J. Steinmiller Jr.]]), on his wife. The marriage counselor Dr. Wong ([[B.D. Wong]]), tries to get them to open up, but, behaving professionally, he refuses to intercede on either side.  Meanwhile, a criminal named Gus ([[Denis Leary]]) is in the midst of stealing jewelry from a safe in a home he has broken into; however, he accidentally sets off the alarm, a trap door opens and he lands in the basement. Only after he is bitten on the leg by a guard dog is Gus able to escape the house, but his getaway car, driven by his bumbling, alcoholic partner Murray ([[Richard Bright (actor)|Richard Bright]]), is no longer there. Then he runs into Lloyd and Caroline.  Holding a gun on them, Gus orders the couple to drive him to their house. Along the way Caroline and Lloyd continue to argue, with Gus beginning to act as a referee and repeatedly telling them to shut up.  Police set up roadblocks and a reward is posted for Gus. At the house, Lloyd and Caroline continue to argue. A neighbor dressed as Santa stops by, bringing a fruitcake, and two inept police officers go door-to-door looking for Gus. Knowing full well that Murray will seek refuge at a seedy bar, Gus calls the bar and describes Murray to the bartender. He tells Murray to steal a boat for their getaway. Jesse comes home and discovers his parents tied up. Jesse is unhappy, forced to attend military school, and has been blackmailing a commanding officer there named Siskel ([[J.K. Simmons]]) with photographs of an affair. He prefers Gus to his parents.  Lloyd’s family is en route for the holidays. It includes his brother Gary ([[Adam LeFevre]]), sister-in-law Connie ([[Christine Baranski]]), their two children Mary and John (Ellie Raab and Phillip Nicoll), and Lloyd’s mother Rose ([[Glynis Johns]]), who is extremely wealthy and bullies everyone in the family. Gus pretends to be Lloyd’s and Caroline’s marriage counselor, Dr. Wong, since he can't hold everyone hostage. Jesse is tied up and gagged upstairs in his parents' closet.  Caroline and Lloyd are unable to stop fighting, and Caroline demands a divorce. Gus' pointed comments goad Lloyd to finally find the guts to stand up to his wife and his mother. Everyone finds out who Gus really is after Rose attempts to go upstairs; Gus puts a gun to her head and Connie, fed up with everybody, says, "Shoot her."  Siskel turns up to reveal how he's being blackmailed. Jesse has managed to untie himself and is discovered with his hidden money. Then the neighbor dressed as Santa returns, very drunk, wondering why he never gets a gift in return. He spots the gun and clumsily lunges at Gus, who knocks him out.  The state police arrive and Lloyd, having a change of heart decides he can't 'spend his life sending everyone he cares about to prison' and tells Jesse to take Gus to the docks using a path through the woods. Gus steals the Santa suit and makes it safely to the boat. He escapes, arguing with Murray much the same way he argued all night with Caroline and Lloyd.  Back at home, the couple's bickering even drives away the police. Having aired out their differences throughout the evening with their armed robber's assistance, they make up and decide to stay together and kiss. Their reconciliation is interrupted when John informs them that "grandma Rose is eating through her gag."  
La Reine Margot (1994 film)
 During the late 16th century, [[Catholics]] and Protestant [[Huguenots]] are fighting over political control of France, which is ruled by the neurotic, [[hypochondriac]] [[Charles IX of France|King Charles IX]] ([[Jean-Hugues Anglade]]), and his mother, [[Catherine de' Medici]] ([[Virna Lisi]]), a scheming power player. Catherine decides to make an overture of goodwill by offering up her daughter [[Margaret of Valois|Margot]] ([[Isabelle Adjani]]) in marriage to [[Henry IV of France|Henri de Bourbon]] ([[Daniel Auteuil]]), a prominent Huguenot and [[Kingdom of Navarre|King of Navarre]], although she also schemes to bring about the notorious [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] of 1572, when thousands of Protestants are slaughtered. The marriage goes forward but Margot, who does not love Henri, begins a passionate affair with the soldier [[Joseph Boniface de La Môle|La Môle]] ([[Vincent Pérez]]), also a Protestant from a well-to-do family. Murders by poisoning follow, as court intrigues multiply and Queen Catherine's villainous plotting to place her son the Duke of Anjou ([[Pascal Greggory]]) on the throne threatens the lives of La Môle, Margot and Henri of Navarre. A book with pages painted with [[arsenic]] is intended for Henri but instead causes the slow, agonizing death of King Charles. Henri escapes to Navarre and sends La Môle to fetch Margot, but Guise apprehends him. La Môle is beheaded in the [[Bastille]] before Margot can save him, and King Charles finally dies. Margot escapes carrying La Môle's embalmed head as Anjou is proclaimed King of France as [[Henry III of France|Henry III]].

Revenge of the Nerds IV: Nerds in Love
 In this movie, Dudley "Booger" Dawson ([[Curtis Armstrong]]) is getting married to his Omega Mu girlfriend Jeannie ([[Corinne Bohrer]]), but the father of the bride tries to stop them, as his desire to maintain his conservative, nouveau-riche standing clashes with his daughter's common interests with and love for the nerdy Booger. Jeannie's father works with his loathsome son-in-law Chip (the husband of Jeannie's older sister Gaylord) to find a way to discredit Booger and cause Jeannie to call off the wedding. Lewis Skolnick and the other nerds discover the conspiracy and work to save Booger's wedding ceremony from being torpedoed. In a subplot, Lewis' wife Betty is pregnant with their first child, and is in her third trimester as the wedding date approaches.  Booger fights an accusation that he fathered an [[illegitimate]] child. In the end, Jeannie's mom tells her husband that she will leave him if he does not support his daughter's wedding to Booger, and Chip's accusations fall apart when the little girl reveals she was "drafted" from an orphanage to play the illegitimate child role. Chip's wife decides to divorce him and throw him out of their lives forever, leaving Chip to swear his own revenge against the nerds (while Gaylord declares to cheers that her next husband will be a nerd). In the end, Booger and Jeannie are married, Betty gives birth to a healthy baby boy, and the newly married couple tell Heidi, the little orphan girl, they would like to adopt her.  
Richie Rich (film)
 [[Richie Rich (comics)|Richard "Richie" Rich Jr.]] ([[Macaulay Culkin]]) is the world's wealthiest kid, the son of [[billionaire]] businessman and philanthropist Richard Rich, Sr. ([[Edward Herrmann]]). Richie has only his loyal butler [[Herbert Cadbury]] ([[Jonathan Hyde]]) as a companion, and lacks any friends his own age. At a dedication to the reopening of United Tool, a factory Richard recently acquired (intending to modernize the [[factory]] and give it away to the workers as a token of goodwill) Richie encounters a group of [[Sandlot ball|sandlot]] kids playing [[baseball]]. Unfortunately, before he is able to talk to them, the overly-strict head of security, Ferguson ([[Chelcie Ross]]), stops Richie and sharply pulls him away. Cadbury, ever the "third parent", reprimands Ferguson for his excessively-physical treatment of Richie.  Richard Sr. tries to spend time with his son whenever he can, but is usually busy. Professor Keenbean ([[Mike McShane]]) has invented a cellular-phone-like machine called the "Dadlink" that pinpoints Richard's location in seconds, so that Richie can talk to his dad whenever he's away on business. Meanwhile, the greedy [[CFO]] of Rich Industries Lawrence Van Dough ([[John Larroquette]]) is planning to steal the Rich financial fortune, believed to be stored in the Rich family vault. Van Dough, with the help of Ferguson, plots to blow up the plane carrying the Rich family to [[England]].  After a failed attempt on Richie's part to make friends with the sandlot kids, Cadbury makes a suggestion to Richie's mother Regina ([[Christine Ebersole]]) and arranges for Richie to stay home in Chicago for a weekend of fun with the sandlot kids. That weekend allows Richie to earn the friendship of the sandlot kids, most importantly, [[Gloria Glad|Gloria Pazinski]] (Stephi Lineberg). Cadbury also begins to fall for Gloria's pleasantly-outspoken mother, Dianne ([[Mariangela Pino]]).  During the plane trip to England, the bomb is detected. Richard is able to toss it out his window, but the bomb detonates while still near the plane, destroying part of the tail, sending ''Billion Dollar One'' into the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Richie Sr. and Regina survive the crash and float on a life raft. Believing that Richie's parents are dead, Van Dough is appointed chairman of Rich Industries, and proceeds to cut the many charitable contributions the Rich family were known for. This includes closing the recently reopened United Tool factory, which the parents of the sandlot kids relied upon for their income. This angers Richie, and so with the encouragement and assistance of Cadbury, he proceeds to the company headquarters and, as a living Rich family member, assumes the chairman position, which enrages Van Dough.  Van Dough has Cadbury framed for the Rich family's apparent murder by putting bomb parts in his room, and most of the Rich family's other loyal servants are fired ''[[en masse]]'' by Van Dough's edict. Van Dough plots to have Cadbury murdered in jail and make it look like a [[suicide]]. With Professor Keenbean eavesdropping on their conversation, he manages to sneak Richie out and enact a successful plan to help Cadbury escape from prison just as a hulking hitman arrives to murder Cadbury; though bruised, Cadbury is able to knock out the hitman. Cadbury and Richie then make their way to Gloria's house, where Dianne tends to Cadbury, and Richie uses Gloria's computer to hack into the Dadlink's mainframe at Richie's mansion.  During this time, Van Dough finds out about Cadbury's escape and, with Ferguson's help, confronts Keenbean. They tie the professor up and threaten him with his own invention, the molecular reorganizer which uses nuclear plasma technology to transform matter into a different form. Keenbean states that the lock to the Rich family vault is [[voice-activated]] and only Richard and Regina can open it. Van Dough, meanwhile, is still unaware of their continued survival.  Richard's Dadlink transceiver was damaged in the crash, and when Richard manages to send out a distress code, the signal is intercepted by Ferguson, who disconnects Richie's modem from the phone line and then informs Van Dough that Richard and Regina are still alive.  After rescuing Keenbean from captivity, the kids and Diane manage to sneak both Richie and Cadbury back into Rich Manor, only to discover that the Dadlink shows that Richie's parents are inside Rich Manor. He is shocked to discover that Van Dough had anticipated his own arrival, and had arranged for his parents' rescue. Held at gunpoint, Van Dough forces the Rich family elders to reveal the location of the Rich vault, while Ferguson and his partner take Richie and his friends to the molecular reorganizer. Once in the lab, Keenbean manages to subdue both Ferguson and his partner with some very sticky substance, but ends up stuck as well; thinking cleverly, he uses a remote to power a robotic bee he created to sting Ferguson, causing him to crash into the machine's [[emergency stop|emergency off]] button, and thus saving Richie and the others.  Van Dough is eventually led to [[Mount Rushmore|Mount Richmore]], a gigantic mountainside-sculpture of the three Rich members' heads where the vault is located. There, he is furious upon discovering that the vault only holds the Rich family's most precious memories and keepsake treasures – nothing that is valuable monetarily; he then learns that the Rich family keeps their money in [[bank]]s, the [[stock market]], and [[real estate]]. Desperate to get the money, he attempts to shoot Richard and Regina, only for Richie to appear in the nick of time and interfere. Van Dough attempts to shoot Richie instead, but manages to barely faze him (because of a special spray of Professor Keenbean's which makes any [[fabric]] [[bulletproof]]). The Rich family manages to get away and the chase leads them down the side of the mountain, where they are under further attack by Ferguson and a rock-blasting laser that had originally been used to sculpt the mountain/vault. Cadbury finally succeeds in disarming Ferguson, while Van Dough ends up hanging upside down for dear life, after Cadbury blasts away the rock-face near him with the laser. Although Richard has never fired any of his employees ever, he allows Richie to fire Van Dough, who is then subsequently punched by Regina.  Later, Richie plays baseball with his new friends for the United Tool team on the Rich Manor's yard (with Cadbury as team coach and Keenbean as umpire) and hits a home run which is picked up by Van Dough, who's doing gardening with Ferguson as part of their [[work release]], and who subsequently tosses the ball into the fountain in humiliated resentment. Richard and Regina blissfully state that Richie now really is the richest boy in the world, as he has found the one thing that money can't buy: friends.  
Rice People
 In Cambodia, where families were torn apart in the [[Communism|communist]] [[Khmer Rouge]]'s genocidal bid to transform the country into an agrarian utopia, it is ironic that people have lost touch with the land. For a generation of children, the rice comes not from the ground, but from a sack, offloaded from the back of a [[United Nations]] relief truck.  So it is in these uncertain times, that a Cambodian family is attempting to grow rice. The father, Pouev, is concerned that the family's plot of land is shrinking, and he might not be able to grow a big enough crop.  The mother, Om, is worried for her husband, and her worst fears are confirmed when Poeuv steps on a poisonous thorn, and then, after a protracted period of being bedridden, dies of infection.  Om is unable to handle the pressure of being the head of the family, nor does she have the strength to tend to the rice fields. She turns to alcohol and gambling and is eventually locked up for her mental illness.  Responsibility for bringing in the crop and raising her six sisters falls on the oldest girl, Sakha.

Revenge of the Musketeers
 In the autumn of 1654, an escaped slave is given refuge at a convent in southern France. His pursuers break into the convent, and after wounding the mother superior, they close in on their prey. One feisty novitiate, Eloise ([[Sophie Marceau]])—the daughter of the renowned swordsman D'Artagnan ([[Philippe Noiret]]) of the famed Three Musketeers—stands up to the intruders, but is shoved aside as they ride off after the frightened slave who escaped from the evil Duke Crassac de Merindol. Eloise finds a blood-stained piece of paper (a simple laundry list) that the slave used to stop a bleeding wound, and believes it holds some secret code. When the mother superior dies, Eloise swears a sacred oath to avenge her. Dressed in men's clothes, Eloise sets out for Paris to elicit the help of her father in tracking down the murderers.  At a roadside tavern, Eloise gets into a sword fight and is helped by a young poet, Quentin la Misère ([[Nils Tavernier]]), who writes her a brief love poem, "Dance, butterfly, dance". Attracted to Eloise, he accompanies her to Paris where she is reunited with her famous father, whom she hasn't seen since childhood. When she shows him the blood-stained paper she believes holds the key to a secret plot, he tells her it looks like a laundry list with blood on it. Later, D'Artagnan visits the grave of his former Musketeer, Athos, and longs for the days when the Musketeers were together, defending their King. Meanwhile, Eloise heads to the royal court, where she meets Cardinal Mazarin ([[Gigi Proietti]]) who is teaching the youthful King Louis XIV (Stéphane Legros) the subtleties of deceitful diplomacy. When Eloise learns that Mazarin is plotting against the King and plans to kill Quentin, she rushes off. Mazarin, who believes she has evidence of his conspiracies, orders the one-eyed man to follow her. The King's men track her down through the narrow streets of Paris, where her father comes to her rescue, and the two defeat several men in a daring sword fight.  With Eloise and Quentin in tow, D'Artagnan reunites with two of his former musketeers—Porthos and Aramis—whom he enlists to help thwart an as yet unidentified conspiracy against the King. Convinced the list contains a secret code, the pedantic Aramis helps decipher the list, using advanced linguistic and Biblical knowledge. Meanwhile, the Duke of Crassac ([[Claude Rich]])—a slave trader and smuggler—is indeed plotting against the King, planning to poison him at the upcoming coronation, blame Mazarin, and when the King's younger brother is installed, step in as the powerful King's protector. Crassac's mistress, Eglantine de Rochefort—the "woman in red" who witnessed the convent murder—tasks him to kill all involved in the convent incident and leave no witnesses.  D'Artagnan, Porthos, Aramis, Eloise, and Quentin ride to the convent, where they hope to learn more about the conspiracy. Eloise finds the body of a dead nun before encountering Eglantine in the process of destroying all evidence of her existence from the convent's records. Eloise is captured by Eglantine's accomplice and taken to Crassac's castle dock where she joins the nuns who are being sold and shipped to the Americas as slaves. When Crassac arrives and spots Eloise, he decides to take her for himself back to his castle. When D'Artagnan and his companions arrive, the aging musketeers slowly scale the castle walls, helped by the one-eyed man, who turns out to be the fourth Musketeer, Athos, thought to have died years before. The Musketeers ride to the nuns' rescue, killing scores of smugglers and freeing the sisters. After the fight, the musketeers ride off to Paris, where the King is preparing for his coronation.  In Paris, D'Artagnan enters the palace and warns the young King about the plot against his life. Meanwhile, Crassac and his followers gather and plan the next day's coronation murder. While Crassac shares his delusional plans to marry Eloise, she suddenly appears—freed by the jealous Eglantine—and in the ensuing sword fight, just as Eloise is about to be killed by three of Crassac's men, D'Artagnan and his men come to her rescue. During the ensuing battle, Eloise chases after the fleeing Crassac and engages him in an extended sword fight that leads them to the roof of the palace. Just as Crassac is about to kill Eloise, D'Artagnan arrives and runs the evil Duke through with a sword, ending the threat to his daughter and to his King. Afterwards, D'Artagnan tells his daughter how proud he is of her and the two embrace.  
The River Wild
 A Boston couple, Gail ([[Meryl Streep]]) and Tom Hartman ([[David Strathairn]]), are having marital problems, due to his inability to spend time with his family because of his work as an [[architect]]. She, a water rafting expert, decides to take their son, Roarke ([[Joseph Mazzello]]), on a holiday rafting trip down the [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]] in Idaho, along with their dog, Maggie. Their daughter, Willa (Stephanie Sawyer), accompanies them to Gail's parents' house in Idaho. At the last minute, just when they are about to leave for the almost week-long trip, Tom joins them. As they are setting off, they meet a couple of other rafters, Wade ([[Kevin Bacon]]) and Terry ([[John C. Reilly]]), who appear to be friendly. Thus they leave for the trip, leaving Willa behind to be taken care of by her grandparents.  After a day's rafting, they make camp for the night, but Tom continues to work on his [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]]s rather than entering fully into the experience, which agitates Roarke. They are joined by Wade and Terry, who help to celebrate Roarke's birthday that night. Gail becomes friendly with Wade. However, after a while he begins acting suspiciously, and she decides it would be best to part ways. During the morning's rafting, he reveals to Roarke that they have a gun with them. As they raft down the river, Gail and Tom discuss a strategy that will allow them to leave Wade and Terry behind, and at lunch they attempt to leave on their raft and get away before Wade and Terry realize what is going on.  The attempt fails, and Wade pulls the gun on them and assaults Tom. Maggie runs off during the melee, avoiding a shot by Wade. Gail then realizes that an armed robbery she had heard about was actually carried out by Wade and Terry, and their rafting trip is actually a way for them to get away. Having found out that they are criminals, the Hartman are forced to raft at gunpoint down the rest of the river before they all set up camp for the night.  During the night, Tom attempts to steal the gun from Terry while he sleeps but is heard and has to run into the bushes and to the river. Wade gives chase and believes he has shot Tom when he hears a loud splash into the water.  A [[park ranger]] named Johnny ([[Benjamin Bratt]]), who knows Gail, is [[whitewater canoeing]] down the river. He bumps into them. Wade holds the gun to Gail's back, and they pretend everything is okay. Later, Johnny reappears. Wade shoots him and throws him into the rapids.  Wade and Terry plan to escape by rafting a set of rapids named the Gauntlet, where rafting is no longer allowed because in recent years one person was killed and another was left paralyzed. Aware that Gail is one of only three people to have ever survived it, they force her to raft down it despite her repeated declarations that she can no longer navigate such big water, especially not with novices and Roarke.  Unbeknownst to anyone Tom has been racing to try to get ahead of the raft, in a desperate attempt to save his family. After a harrowing ride in which Terry is nearly drowned, they manage to make it through the Gauntlet. Tom reappears, and manages to flip the raft. As he struggles with Terry, Gail is able to get the gun.  Wade tells Gail there is no need to kill him, and that if she does, it will haunt her because she will never have a way to know if she truly had to. She, knowing Wade believes the gun has only one round, points it into the air to fire it, but it only clicks on an empty chamber, after which Wade orders Terry to kill Tom and Roarke and goes after Gail. Gail opens the gun, sees the remaining cartridge, chambers the last round, and kills Wade. The film ends with the Hartmans and Terry, who has been arrested, being helicoptered out.

The terrorists, who call themselves S.P.L.I.T. Image (a play on "[[Split Image]]"), have a video camera with which they tape their hostages' every word and action. During a month-long standoff with the police, S.P.L.I.T. Image's only demand is that their broadcasts be televised live worldwide TV, or else the hostages will be killed. S.P.L.I.T. Image makes good on said threat by killing two of the hostages. Cliff, Joe, and a beautiful teenage girl named Wendy Pfister are the only surviving captives. After 36 days, Cliff becomes indifferent to being killed. He says repeatedly, "So Fucking What?", in reply to his captors' death-threats. The coverage of this makes Cliff a media icon.  The movie skips forward to a hospital. Cliff has shot his way to freedom, taking a bullet in the shoulder while Joe has been killed. Despite his friend's demise, Cliff is branded a hero for saving Wendy and killing the terrorists. He's picked up from the hospital by his brother Scott. He is welcomed awkwardly by his domineering father and weak-willed mother. Cliff soon becomes disenchanted with the reporters camped on his front lawn and moves out.  Back on the street, Cliff finds his life changed forever by the convenience store incident. His line &ndash; abbreviated as S.F.W. &ndash; is on banners, newspapers, CDs, and billboard advertisements. At Burger Boy, the fast food restaurant where he works, Cliff finds his name and image posted alongside a "Special $.36 ''Spaburger''" (named after him), being marketed in commemoration of his 36 days in captivity.  Cliff visits Joe's older sister Monica. She resents the media idolization directed at Cliff, while her deceased brother has gotten neither sympathy nor attention. Cliff spends a night of empty passion with Monica. He visits another friend, Morrow Streeter, who lets Cliff hide out at the elegant home of his lawyer-sister Janet. She advises Cliff to exploit his notoriety for personal gain. Completely lacking in any sense of purpose, Cliff hitchhikes out of Los Angeles. He gets a ride with a disaffected couple, who confide with him about their marital troubles. Realizing that running from his problems is pointless because they will follow him everywhere, Cliff discovers the inspiration he has been seeking. Using his celebrity status to his advantage, Cliff checks into a fancy hotel; when he offers to promote the establishment, he is given a free suite. Cliff holds press conferences, makes public appearances, holds autograph signings, and generally portrays himself as a rebel.  More than anything, Cliff aspires to reunite with Wendy.  She has been featured on the news, but refuses to make any statement regarding her ordeal in the convenience store. Cliff reaches out to her and soon a romantic attraction develops, but their relationship is hampered by the reporters and paparazzi who shamelessly tail them. They evade the media and revisit the convenience store, which has been closed down and boarded up as a crime scene. After reminiscing how he and Joe overpowered and killed their captors in a huge gunfight, Cliff tells Wendy he'd like to leave his notoriety behind him, just so the two of them can live out their lives together in a quiet romance.  A few days later, Cliff and Wendy make a public appearance at a local high school. They receive a standing ovation from a crowd of adoring students, who chant Cliff's line: "So Fucking What!" One distraught-looking student, Barbara "Babs" Wyler, does not join in the cheering. After a minute of sitting in angry silence, Babs produces a gun from her book-bag and stands up. With a yell of "EVERYTHING matters!" she fires on Cliff and Wendy, seriously wounding them both. Media attention switches to Babs as she is arrested, booked, and indicted for attempted murder. Her line of "Everything matters" becomes the new public catchphrase, replacing Cliff's "S.F.W.". Reporters and other media people cannot stop talking about Babs' actions. Sharing their own hospital ward, the recovering Cliff and Wendy are elated that their media ordeal is over. They slip away to get married, and to celebrate their newfound privacy.

The Sultan of the land is worried as his son, The Prince, has not yet chosen a bride to marry, and has turned down almost every princess that seeks to marry him. The Sultan expresses his worry to his vizier, Haman, and with his health failing, the Sultan keeps pressuring his son to choose a wife. He is even more upset as once long ago when the Prince was young, he was already engaged to marry a princess of a neighbouring kingdom; when she was born, everyone was filled with joy and happiness, but one fateful day, the princess mysteriously vanished, leaving the kingdom without an heir and the Prince heartbroken. Eventually the Sultan decides to have every eligible woman arrive the next day so that his son may finally choose a wife to secure an heir to the throne. However, the Prince notices a young woman near a river washing her clothes and immediately falls in love with her; the young girl notices him and becomes frightened and soon leaves. The Prince tries to stop her, but instead only finds a scarf she has left behind and decides to go into town to find her.  However, unaware to either the Sultan or Prince, Haman the vizier actually despises them and has a plan to finally gain control of the throne. He seeks guidance from a magical jewel known as the Lord of the Amulet, that helped once long ago and reveals that he had actually kidnapped the princess when she was a baby, as it was part of his plan to gain control of the kingdom. The Lord of the Amulet tells him of a magical lamp that is hidden in a cave that is only revealed every three years during a blue moon, but also reveals that only a person of pure of heart can enter the cave. The Lord of the Amulet reveals that a young woman named Aliyah-Din is the only person capable of entering the cave to retrieve the lamp (and who is also revealed to be the same woman the Prince has fallen in love with) before telling Haman to never seek his help again. Haman then goes into town and soon finds Aliyah-Din, where he explains that only she is capable of entering the cave to retrieve the lamp, but also lies to her saying that the lamp has special powers that will help heal the sick Sultan, to which Aliyah-Din agrees to help.  Later that day, the Prince is still searching for Aliyah-Din where he also attracts a lot of attention from many women who seek to marry him the next day, causing the Prince to discover of his father's plans. He is outraged of his father wanting him to marry a woman he has only met as his heart only lies toward Aliyah-Din. Meanwhile, Aliyah-Din is late meeting with Haman, but on her way, she discovers the news that the Prince shall choose a bride the next day; however, a woman nearby tells her not to get her hopes up as she believes that Aliyah-Din doesn't have a chance of gaining the Prince's love and affections. Aliyah-Din and the Prince then soon bump into each other, and Aliyah-Din falls in love with the Prince. However, remembering her duties to help retrieve the lamp, Aliyah-Din is forced to leave the Prince, although he attempts to stop her, The Prince soon loses sight of her, much to his dismay.  At night, Aliyah-Din meets with Haman where they witness the cave opening. Haman instructs Aliyah-Din to touch only the lamp and nothing else as she enters the cave. Aliyah-Din enters a room and despite Haman's warnings, she picks what seems to be an innocent flower, unaware that it's actually a piece of treasure. Aliyah-Din soon finds the lamp near a water fountain, but discovers that by picking the flower, the cave has started to collapse and it soon closes, leaving her and the lamp trapped inside much to Haman's anger. Aliyah-Din is upset as she has no way out of the cave and that the Prince will eventually pick a bride to marry the next day. She then notices that the lamp has writing that reads "Rub Me"; she rubs it as it instructs which releases Yogi Bear, a fully powered Genie and his sidekick Boo Boo, a Genie-in-training, who reveal to Aliyah-Din that she is their new master and they are allowed to grant her three wishes.  Meanwhile, back at the Palace, Haman is creating a special potion to use on the Sultan that will make him fall into a deep sleep. He goes to the Sultan's chambers where the potion takes an immediate effect and he falls asleep; soon after the Prince arrives to talk to his father, unaware of the sleep spell. The Prince apologizes for not having selected a bride and wanting to put his father's happiness before his own, reveals he will choose a bride and marry whoever it may be the next day, despite the fact he is still upset over losing Aliyah-Din. However, the Prince now notices his father's condition and Haman quickly puts the Prince under the same spell. Haman then takes the unconscious Prince to the dungeons where he chains him to a wall and takes on the Prince's appearance.  Aliyah-Din goes to accept the Prince's hand in marriage unaware of who she's dealing with. Haman reveals himself, takes the lamp, (therefore making him Yogi and Boo-Boo's new master) and has Aliyah-Din thrown into the dungeon. Haman uses his first 2 wishes to make himself sultan and ruler of the whole universe. Aliyah-Din escapes from the dungeon and removes the lamp from Haman's grasp, leaving him without a third wish. Aliyah-Din finally gets a do-over of three wishes and uses her first wish to bring everything back to normal.  With everything fully restored, The Prince regains consciousness and orders the palace guards to arrest Haman. The Prince then soon reunites with Aliyah-Din and returns her scarf; after finally learning her name, The Prince asks Aliyah-Din to marry him. However, Aliyah-Din believes that he doesn't truly love her as she believes his love is mainly due to her wishing for it, but The Prince instead reveals to her that he has been in love with her ever since he first saw her. Aliyah-Din is delighted and The Prince assures her that they can be together. Soon the now-awakened Sultan arrives and the Prince introduces his father to Aliyah-Din and reveals his desire to marry her. The Sultan, however, cannot bless their desire for marriage, as he reveals to his son that he can only marry a princess, Aliyah-Din rubs the lamp as she hears his words and Yogi appears. Aliyah-Din then wishes to become a princess again, and is soon transformed back into her princess attire. However, even despite the wish, The Sultan cannot allow Aliyah-Din and the Prince to be married.  Saddened, The Prince apologizes to Aliyah-Din as it appears that their love can never be. However, upon learning her name, The Sultan realizes that Aliyah-Din is the long-lost princess who the Prince was engaged to. Delighted, The Sultan allows them to be married. Aliyah-Din then asks Yogi for her final wish to be a huge wedding, which he gladly grants. The Prince and Aliyah-Din celebrate their engagement and share their first kiss, as Boo Boo finally becomes a full-fledged Genie and grants Yogi his own personal wish: a picnic basket.  ===''Sinbad the Sailor''===  The second and final tale is about ''[[Sinbad the Sailor]]'' (played by [[Magilla Gorilla]]) and how he mistakes a pirate ship for a cruise ship, the latter being a running gag throughout the story.  Before Shaggy can escape, the Caliph decides to start the ceremony right away, but when the wedding cake arrives, Shaggy pigs out, and his ruse is discovered. However, the Caliph reveals that since he enjoyed listening to the stories, he has decided to make Shaggy and Scooby royal storytellers, which the duo happily accept (even if they lost the royal food tasting job).

At the village, the Doctor discovers he has run out of fruit brandy. Unaccustomed to abandoning his house, he decides to go out to buy liquor nonetheless. Outside, he is met with hostile weather and the arrival of the night. After purchasing his brandy, he is approached by Estike (Erika Bók), a young girl who desperately reaches out for his help. Behaving aggressively towards the child, the Doctor reconsiders and naively tries to apologize as the girl leaves and disappears in the darkness. Chasing after her, the Doctor passes out, and collapses in nearby woods, and is found in the morning by the town's conductor who takes him to a hospital.  The morning before the Doctor left his house, Estike is tricked by her brother, Sanyi (András Bodnár), into planting a "money tree" somewhere in the wasteland. She tortures and poisons her cat to demonstrate that she has some control over something in her life. After finding out she has been deceived by her brother and trying in vain to recover her money, she succumbs to silent despair, devastated by what she's done to her pet. Dangerously marauding in the woods, the girl approaches the local bar, and peers through its window, where most of the villagers dance to accordion music, unaware of the child's voyeurism. Afterwards, she encounters the Doctor and cries out for his help to save her cat. Rebuffed, she retreats into an abandoned ruin and poisons herself.  The following day, Irimiás arrives at the village while Estike's funeral is being held. Filled with grief, Irimiás speaks to the villagers hatefully and convinces them of handing him the money of their proposed venture in order to start a new collective farm in another city. The villagers travel together to a distant abandoned building, where they collapse into sleep and have intense nightmares. Meanwhile, Irimiás and Petrina meet with an accomplice in a nearby city to acquire explosives, for reasons never explicitly explained.  The next day, Irimiás tells the villagers that the plan to establish a new farm has been delayed and that their only hope of establishing a farm is to scatter around the country for an unspecified amount of time. Schmidt and Kráner ([[János Derzsi]]) demand Irimiás return their money. Irimiás agrees, but upon expressing his disapproval at their lack of trust, the villagers shamefully return the money. After traveling in a truck to the city, each of the villagers is assigned a different task by Irimiás and dismissed, except for Futaki, who tells Irimiás that he would rather get a job as a watchman, and leaves on his own.  Government officials receive Irimiás' report detailing the villagers' descriptions, abilities and defects, and decide to re-write it in a more bureaucratically friendly way before filing it away and leaving for home.  The Doctor returns home several weeks later, unaware that Irimiás had taken the entire community with him. As he sits down to write some notes, the same bells that woke Futaki up start ringing. The Doctor decides to leave his house once more to investigate the ruined church where the closest bell is heard. He discovers a madman in the middle of ruins desperately ringing the bells and shouting that Turks are coming. Frightened, the Doctor returns home, muttering nihilistic thoughts. The bells keep on ringing as he covers his windows with boards, completely submerging himself in darkness as he writes the narration that began the film.

He attends a game at a small college to see pitcher Tommy Lacy, and is invited to dinner at Tommy's house by Tommy himself. Pretending to be [[Catholic]] like his parents, he convinces them that Tommy should sign a contract with the Yankees, which they reluctantly agree. But on Tommy's major league debut, he suffers an extreme case of stage fright, leading to Al dragging him to the game [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], and Tommy vomits on the pitcher's mound. The Yankees suffer an embarrassment from Al's find, and Al is punished by being sent to the [[Mexico|Mexican]] countryside to look for his next find.  Al attends game after game finding no one, until he gets his first look at Steve Nebraska, a young American with a consistent 100+ mph fastball and hits [[home run]]s constantly at-bat. Steve is very popular with the fans, especially females, but is very child-like. Al talks with Steve, and he instantly agrees to be the next Yankee. However, when Al notifies the Yankee brass of his find, he is fired and told not to bring anyone back. He decides to take Steve back to the United States with him anyway, becoming his unofficial agent. Steve freaks out in the middle of the terminal at [[Newark International Airport]] when he momentarily thinks Al is missing. Later when Steve is asleep at Al's apartment, he suffers a nightmare where he screams and is abused by an unknown party.  Al arranges an open audition at Yankee Stadium in front of representatives from every [[Major League Baseball]] team. A bidding war ensues after Steve strikes out [[Keith Hernández]] and homers off [[Bret Saberhagen]], seeing what Al saw in Mexico. The bidding war ends with Nebraska signing a $55 million contract with the Yankees, but difficulties arise when Steve snaps at the pressing photographers, leading to the Yankee management demanding Steve to be [[Psychiatry|psychiatrically]] evaluated in order to ensure he will not turn out to be as unstable as Al's earlier finds. Al picks the first psychiatrist from the yellow pages, H. Aaron, to see with Steve, expecting a quick evaluation, followed by a massive payday for both of them. After examining him using pictures that Steve sees with disconnection, the doctor finds Steve to be a deeply troubled young man, severely abused as a child, and has blocked almost every memory of his early life. On top of that, Steve might see Al as a father, the source of the abuse. Not wanting to give a negative evaluation, Al begs the doctor to grant a positive one instead, making a deal that she sees Steve everyday before beginning his professional career.   Living with Steve proves to be a hassle for Al; Steve throws plates at reporters outside their apartment, embarrasses [[Tony Bennett]] when he sings his songs at his performance, and screams at Al over what he wants to do with his days and nights. Al tries to help Steve during a press conference by lying about his past, which enrages the doctor. But Al sees that Steve's behavior is based on the doctor helping Steve deal with his past that he's long since blocked away. Al pleads with her to help him see everything in his life as a positive. But Steve ends up depressed when the Yankees reach the [[World Series]], and Steve is contractually obligated to pitch in Game 1, despite not being mentally prepared to do so.   On the night of the big game, everyone watches, waiting for Steve's big debut, pressuring both him and Al. Steve ends up atop Yankee Stadium, refusing to come down to pitch; Al climbs up to see him, just as a helicopter arrives to give Steve a big entrance. Al pleads with him to play, leading to an argument between the two as Steve doesn't want to play despite how much Al fought for him. Eventually his conscience gets the better of him and Al offers the kid a chance to walk away from it all, no strings attached. This gesture proving Al's loyalty to Steve helps Steve face reality, and gaining the excitement to play baseball. Finally on the field, Steve pitches a [[perfect game]], striking out 27 [[St. Louis Cardinals]] batters on 81 consecutive strikes. Steve hits two solo home runs in a 2-0 Yankees victory. Though the Yankees win the game, it is never made clear who won the Series, but for Al and Steve, a perfect game is a perfect ending.

Near the end of the film, James finally dreams and remembers what has happened to his mother.  As Graham goes through the extended vetting process to be an adoptive parent, He then has to attend classes and meet regularly with social workers.

He moves towards Graham and places his arms around Graham's waist. He then hugs him briefly. Showing affection for the first time in his young life. James also makes friends in this time with some of the local children racing with a bicycle.  On one trip out in the car, Graham tries to explain how a relationship should work, He explains it should be a partnership, he never mentions love. Graham has to visit key people in Jamie's past; one of them Lynn, a foster mother, who was one of the few females Jamie ever got along with, was disappointed that Jamie would not stop in to see her. She explained to Graham on Jamie's constant running away and finding him partially dressed always hiding in holes and covered in dirt.

Jamie stands in the small shop choosing gear while Graham remains outside with his caseworker. She quickly tells Graham to beware of knots for once they are tied they are harder to get out from. It's a happy experience, Jamie plays in a creek while teaching an inept Graham the ways of camping or as the English refer to it as tenting. Jamie tests Graham as well by finding a stick and giving himself and injury on his forehead. He tells Graham while remembering an experience by his birth father, that the kiss has to be a long one to make it feel better. After Graham asks Jamie if he was testing Graham and Jamie replies, 'I often test people.' Unfortunately this is fairly common in the world scope of foster care since nothing is ever permanent. Later that night on the camp out Jamie goes to relieve himself then returns to the tent cold, and slips into the sleeping bag with Graham. Who at the time is dreaming and does not even realize the boy is in with him until he wakes in the morning.  After a few weekends together, Graham takes James to meet Graham's father's brother, Uncle Turpin (John Hurt). Turpin teases James and finally makes him smile. He asks Graham if he has ever apologized to his father, he always hated Graham's mother, since he would never let the father have a moments peace.

Serial Mom
 Beverly Sutphin appears to be a typical suburban housewife living with her dentist husband, Eugene, and their teenage children, Misty and Chip, in the suburbs of [[Baltimore]]. However, she is secretly a [[serial killer]], murdering people over the most trivial of perceived slights, including mere [[faux pas]].  During breakfast, Detectives Pike and Gracey arrive to question the family about the vulgar harassment of their neighbor, Dottie Hinkle. After the police and her family leave, Beverly disguises her voice to make obscene phone calls to Dottie, revealed in a flashback to be retaliation for Dottie previously stealing a parking space from Beverly. Later that day, Mr. Stubbins, Chip's math teacher, becomes Beverly's first known murder victim after he criticizes Chip's interests and questions the boy's mental health and family life, as well as berating her parenting. Beverly runs Mr. Stubbins over with her car, and is witnessed by Luann Hodges, a young woman smoking [[marijuana]] nearby. The next day, Misty is upset when Carl Pageant stands her up for a date. Beverly spots Carl with another girl at a [[Flea market|swap meet]] and murders him in the bathroom with a fireplace poker.  Eugene discovers that Beverly has hidden a collection of serial killer memorabilia beneath their mattress. That evening at dinner, Chip comments that his friend Scotty thinks that she is the killer. Beverly immediately leaves in her car, prompting the family to rush to Scotty's house for fear that Beverly plans to kill him; however, Beverly has actually gone to kill Eugene's patient Ralph Sterner and his wife, Betty, for calling Eugene away to treat her husband's chronic toothache on a Saturday they were supposed to spend [[birdwatching]], and for eating chicken that reminds her of the starlings. She stabs Betty with scissors borrowed from the Sutphins' neighbor Rosemary, and pushes an air conditioner from a second-story window onto Ralph, standing on the walkway below. Meanwhile, the rest of the family and the police arrive at Scotty's house, only to find him in his room masturbating to an old porn video.  That Sunday, police follow the Sutphins to church and a news report names Beverly as the suspect in the Sterners' murders. The service ends in pandemonium when the sound of Beverly sneezing causes everyone to panic and flee the church. Police detectives confirm that Beverly's fingerprints match those at the Sterner crime scene and attempt to arrest her, but she escapes. She hides at the video rental store where Chip works, but a customer, Mrs. Jensen, argues with Chip over paying a fee for failing to rewind a videotape and calls him a "son of a [[Psychopath|psycho]]". Beverly follows Mrs. Jensen home and [[Lamb to the Slaughter|bludgeons her to death with]] a [[leg of lamb]] while she sings along to "[[Tomorrow (1977 song)|Tomorrow]]" on her rented copy of ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]''. Scotty witnesses the attack through a window, Beverly sees him, and a car chase ensues. Catching him at a local club, [[Hammerjack's]], Beverly sets Scotty aflame onstage in front of a deranged crowd during the set of an all-girl band called Camel Lips. The Sutphin family arrive, as do the police, and Beverly is arrested.  Beverly's trial becomes a national sensation. The media dub her "Serial Mom", Chip hires an agent to manage the family's media appearances and Misty sells [[Merchandising|merchandise]] outside the courthouse. During opening arguments, Beverly's lawyer claims that she is [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]], but she fires him and proposes to [[Pro se legal representation|represent herself]], citing various law books she has read to her prosecutor's dismay. The judge reluctantly agrees and the trial begins. Beverly proves to be extremely skilled and formidable in defending herself, systematically discrediting nearly every witness against her by using trick questioning to incite Dottie to [[contempt of court]] by repeated obscenities, finding a [[transsexual]]-themed magazine in Gracey's trash, invoking that judging a person by what they choose to read proves nothing, badgering Rosemary into admitting she doesn't recycle and fanning her legs repeatedly at pervert Marvin Pickles, witness to Carl's murder, whose resulting over-arousal causes him to commit [[perjury]]. The only witness she does not actively discredit is Luann Hodges, but Hodges is unable to provide credible testimony anyway, due to being under the influence of marijuana. During Pike's crucial testimony, the entire courtroom (including the judge and jury) is distracted by the arrival of [[Suzanne Somers]], who plans to portray Beverly as the heroine of a [[television film]].  Beverly is acquitted of all charges, stunning her family, who vow to "never get on her nerves". Throughout the trial, Beverly has been displeased that a juror ([[Patty Hearst]]) is wearing white shoes after Labor Day. Beverly follows her to a payphone and fatally strikes her in the head with the receiver. Somers then angers Beverly into an outburst by trying to pose for a picture that will show Beverly's "bad side", just as the juror's body is discovered.  The film ends with a close-up of Beverly's wicked smile and a caption stating that Beverly "refused to cooperate" with the making of the film.

The Shadow (1994 film)
 In [[Tibet]], following the [[World War I|First World War]], an American named Lamont Cranston ([[Alec Baldwin]]), succumbing to his dark instincts, sets himself up as a warlord and [[opium]] kingpin under the alias of ''Yin-Ko'' (said to mean "Dark Eagle" in [[Mandarin Chinese]]; "ying" means eagle, however it is unclear what "ko" means).<ref>|date=}}</ref> He is abducted by servants of the [[Tulku]] ([[Brady Tsurutani]], voiced by [[Barry Dennen]]), a holy man who exhibits otherworldly powers and knows Cranston's identity. He offers Cranston a chance to redeem himself and become a force for good. Cranston refuses but is silenced by the [[Kīla (Buddhism)|''Phurba'']] ([[Frank Welker]]), a mystical sentient flying dagger.  Ultimately, Cranston remains under the tutelage of the Tulku for seven years. In addition to undergoing rigorous physical training, he learns how to hypnotize others, read their minds, and bend their perceptions so that he cannot be seen—except, of course, for his shadow.  Returning to [[New York City]], Cranston resumes his former life as a wealthy playboy. He secretly operates as The Shadow, a vigilante who terrorizes the city's underworld. He recruits some of the people he saves from criminals to act as his agents, providing him with information and specialist knowledge. Cranston's secret identity is endangered upon meeting [[Margo Lane]] ([[Penelope Ann Miller]]), a socialite who is also [[Telepathy|telepathic]].  Shiwan Khan ([[John Lone]]), the Tulku's rogue protégé and murderer whose powers apparently surpass Cranston's, wakes up while in a [[sarcophagus]] that once kept his ancestor - the [[Mongol Empire]] founder [[Genghis Khan]]. He uses hypnosis to make a security guard ([[Ethan Phillips]]) shoot himself in the head after the guard refuses to join Khan's army. Khan plans to fulfill his ancestor's goal of world domination. He offers Cranston an alliance, but Cranston refuses. Cranston acquires a rare coin from Khan and learns that it is made of a metal called "bronzium" (an impure form of [[uranium]]) that theoretically can generate an [[Nuclear explosion|atomic explosion]]. He learns that Margo's father Reinhardt ([[Ian McKellen]]), a scientist who works on building an atomic device for the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]], has disappeared, and realizes that Khan needs Reinhardt and his invention to build an [[atomic bomb]].  Shiwan Khan [[hypnosis|hypnotizes]] Margo and commands her to kill the Shadow. She goes to Cranston's home, but Cranston breaks his hold on her.  She realizes that since she was ordered to kill the Shadow and she instinctively went to Cranston's home, that he is the Shadow. Cranston prepares to rescue Margo's father but is thwarted by Khan's henchmen, especially when Reinhardt's assistant Farley Claymore ([[Tim Curry]]) allies with Khan. The Shadow discovers the location of Khan's hideout, the luxurious Hotel Monolith, a building in the middle of the city that Khan has rendered invisible. Knowing Reinhardt has completed the bomb under Khan's hypnotic control, The Shadow enters the hotel for a final showdown with Khan.  The Shadow fights his way through the building, and hypnotically influences Claymore to jump from a balcony to his death to prevent him from building another bomb. He finds Khan, but is subdued by the Phurba. The Shadow realizes that only a peaceful mind can truly control the Phurba and he seizes command of the dagger. The Shadow launches it into Khan's torso, creating a lapse in Khan's hypnotic control that  frees Reinhardt and restores the hotel's visibility. The Shadow pursues Khan into the bowels of the building, while Margo and Reinhardt disarm the bomb. The Shadow defeats Khan by [[telekinesis|telekinetically]] hurling a shard of mirror into a frontal lobe of Khan's skull.  A confused Khan wakes up in a padded cell in a mental hospital, discovering that his powers are now gone. One of the doctors — also an agent of The Shadow — tells Khan that they were able to save his life by [[Lobotomy|removing a part of his brain]] "that nobody uses", which in reality controlled his psychic abilities. Cranston and Margo begin a serious relationship and join forces to fight crime.

Moving opposite to Sethupathi's house, Sivaprakasam pretends to be a very nice man "Satyaprakasham" and manages to fool Sethupathi's mother, wife (Meena), sister, and grandfather and convinces all of them of his ''true intentions'' to such an extent that they agree to his engagement with their mute daughter Saraswathi. Sivaprakasam avoids Sethupathi and sees to it that during both the engagement and the wedding Sethupathi is occupied so that he cannot come face to face with Sivaprakasam.  After the wedding the Terrorists take over a school where Sethupathi's wife (Meena) is a teacher and demand for a plane and money to take them abroad. Sivaprakasam brings his wife (Sethupathi's sister) and watches her get gang raped until Sethupathi's wife shoots her, unable to bear her suffering. Sivaprakasam also shoots a boy student of class v.  As the terrorists escape the school towards the plane and take off, Sethupathi has arrived after having killed one of their number, and disguising himself, he elimitates all of them including Sivaprakasam and lands the plane safely (on instructions of the injured pilot).  The movie ends with Sethupathi receiving his coveted grandfather's medal.

The Shawshank Redemption
  In 1947 [[Portland, Maine]], banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to two [[Back-to-back life sentences|consecutive]] [[Life imprisonment|life sentences]] at the Shawshank State Penitentiary. He is befriended by [[contraband]] smuggler, Ellis "Red" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a [[Geologist's hammer|rock hammer]], and later a large poster of [[Rita Hayworth]] for Andy. Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly [[Prison rape|assaulted and raped]] by "the Sisters" and their leader, Bogs.  In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being [[Inheritance tax|taxed on an inheritance]] and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Left crippled, Bogs is transferred to another prison, and Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, the warden begins using him to handle matters for himself and a variety of people, including guards from other prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature requesting funds to improve the prison's decaying library.  Brooks is [[parole]]d in 1954 after serving 50 years, but he cannot adjust to the outside world, and he commits suicide by [[hanging]] himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''. He plays [[Sull'aria...che soave zeffiretto|an excerpt]] over the public address system, and is punished with [[solitary confinement]]. After his release from solitary, Andy explains that hope is what gets him through his time, a concept that Red dismisses. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving [[Kickback (bribery)|bribes]]. Andy [[money laundering|launders]] the money using the alias Randall Stephens.  Tommy Williams is incarcerated for burglary in 1965. Andy and Red befriend him, and Andy helps him pass his [[General Educational Development|GED]] exam. A year later, Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for the murders for which Andy was convicted. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but he refuses to listen and sends him back to solitary confinement when he mentions the money laundering. Norton has Hadley murder Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy declines to continue the laundering, but he relents after Norton threatens to burn the library, remove Andy's protection from the guards, and move him to worse conditions. After two months, Andy is released from solitary confinement, and he tells Red of his dream of living in [[Zihuatanejo]], a Mexican coastal town. Red feels Andy is being unrealistic, but promises him that if he is ever released, he will visit a specific hayfield near [[Buxton, Maine]], and retrieve a package Andy buried there. He worries about Andy's well-being, especially when he learns Andy asked fellow inmate Heywood to supply him with  of rope.  The next day at [[Roll call (policing)|roll call]], the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at the poster of [[Raquel Welch]] hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy dug with his rock hammer over the last 19 years. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, using the rope to bring with him Norton's suit, shoes, and the [[ledger]] containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens and visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money, then mails the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. State police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.  After serving 40 years, Red is paroled. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money, and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to [[Fort Hancock, Texas]], to cross the border into Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited.  
Shallow Grave
  Chartered accountant David Stephens, physician Juliet Miller, and journalist Alex Law share a flat in Edinburgh. Needing a new flatmate, they interview several applicants in a calculatedly cruel manner, amusing themselves at the applicants' expense before finally offering the room to the mysterious Hugo. Shortly after Hugo moves in, the trio find him dead from an apparent overdose in his room, with a large suitcase full of money. They agree to keep the death a secret and the money for themselves, and to bury the body in the woods after removing the hands and feet to prevent identification. They draw lots, and David is given the gruesome and traumatising task of dismembering the corpse, while Juliet disposes of the hands and feet in her hospital's incinerator.  Unknown to the three friends, Hugo is being sought by a pair of violent men, who are torturing and murdering informants as they follow Hugo's trail. The flat below theirs is broken into making them anxious. The break-in also draws the attention of the police, who are surprised when the three deny that they ever had a fourth flatmate. While Juliet and Alex spend part of the money to 'feel better', David's fears turn into full-blown paranoia. He hides the suitcase of money in the attic and begins living there, drilling holes in the attic floor to watch the living space below. The relationship between the three becomes increasingly strained and distrustful.  The men trailing Hugo break into the trio's flat, coercing Alex and Juliet to reveal where the money is. As the men enter the dark attic, David, who has been lying there in wait, kills both of them with a hammer. David returns to the woods to dispose of the bodies. Alex and Juliet become more worried than ever about David's mental state, and David becomes worried that the two are conspiring against him. Meanwhile, the police are already circling in the form of Detectives Inspector McCall and Constable Mitchell. Juliet, hoping to flee the country, secretly buys a plane ticket to [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, but she also seduces David to get at the money. Matters come to a head after the three bodies are discovered in their shallow graves, and Alex is sent by his newspaper to cover the story. He returns to find Juliet and David have reached an understanding about their shared plans that excludes him. Alex, now fearing for his life, tries to secretly phone D.I. McCall, but he is interrupted by David and Juliet leaving. The doorstep altercation quickly escalates into a murderous triangular fight. David reveals that he knows Juliet's secret plan to betray them and attacks her. During the battle, David stabs Alex in the chest, but is killed by Juliet before he can finish Alex off.  With David dead, Juliet tells Alex that he can't come with her. She then forces the knife even deeper into Alex's torso, pinning him to the floor, before fleeing to the airport with the suitcase of money. At the airport, she discovers that she has been tricked: the suitcase is not filled with money but with hundreds of headline clippings about the triple grave taken from Alex's newspaper. Devastated, with no possessions except her air ticket, and knowing that she will soon be wanted for murder, Juliet boards the plane. The police arrive at the flat to find Alex still alive, but bleeding heavily and pinned to the floor. The camera pans down to reveal that Alex has hidden the missing bundles of cash under the floorboards.  
Shatter Dead
 The film opens with a scene of a woman having sex with an apparently female angel. No explanation is given in the film. The back of the DVD cover says the Angel of Death impregnates a mortal woman, causing the dead to come alive. The next shot is of seventeen months later as Susan works her way through a mostly abandoned town on foot. She encounters some of the living dead, including one who gave up his arm to research. Though they seem somewhat bewildered and eager to please, she catches one zombie stealing gas from her car. She chases him and puts a bullet through his gas canister. It explodes dousing the zombie in flames. Susan returns to her car leaves town. Outside of town, her car runs out of gas. She then finds herself surrounded by zombies to force her from her car. A preacher claims her car for the service of the Lord and drives off after the zombies refill the gas tank.  After walking on foot for a while, another car pulls up. The driver offers her a ride. She holds him at gun point and holds a mirror under his nose. When he doesn't exhale warm moist air, she determines him to be a zombie. She takes the car from him (he doesn't put up a fight) and drives for a while, listening to an announcer discussing the current situation on the radio. He doesn't have much information.  Arriving in a new town, she encounters some living people who direct her to a safe house to stay the night (After giving her the mirror test). While staying there, she encounters Mary, a dead woman pretending to be alive, they shower together. Mary tells Susan that she poisoned herself so she can be beautiful forever. Susan, trusts Mary enough to share the bedroom together. Susan sleeps while Mary plays the harmonium. Susan has a dream where she walks in a graveyard and performs fellatio on her sidearm.  At this point the house is attacked by militant zombies (excited by the Preacher who stole Susan's car). This group of Zombies believes these are the end times and God will return once humanity is all dead. They are intent on converting living humans into their way of, uh, metabolism. Waking up surprised, Susan accidentally shoots Mary in the head, destroying Mary's hope of being beautiful forever. The owner of the house, who looks like the woman from the intro but isn't, is shot in the back at close range with a shotgun. She was pregnant but her wound aborts the baby out the front. Susan watches as the newly dead mother begins to nurse the newly dead fetus.  Susan escapes and encounters the preacher who stole her car. She threatens him while he tries to convince her that death is better than life. Susan gives him the mirror test and discovers that he is still alive. Another shot to the face from Susan and the preacher is now one of the undead.  Susan gets her car and her food back and arrives at the apartment of her boyfriend. He's also killed himself but is up and about. The bathtub is filled with his blood. Her boyfriend has lost his mind. He kept hearing the phone ringing and hearing the dead talking to him (including a cremated mother and a sister who never even knew how to use a phone.)  They can't have sex because he has no blood pressure (his blood is in the bathtub after all), so they have intercourse using her gun as a strap-on. He slips poison into her milk. He wants her to be dead and beautiful forever. She tries to induce vomiting, but he stops her. Before she dies, she manages to throw him out the window, breaking most of his bones (and destroying his hope of being young and beautiful forever). The last sequence of the film is a montage switching back and forth between the preacher making splints for her boyfriend and Susan putting tears in her eyes from the faucet so she can mourn her own death.

Jake Rainer, a former child [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] turned [[psychotherapy|therapist]], is called on to probe the child's mind in order to solve the case.  The psychological drama is provided by the fact that not even Jake can entice Tim to communicate what he has or has not seen regarding the crime. Tim's sister, Sylvie, is protective of him. She eventually warms to Jake's efforts, but is concerned when she learns he was implicated in the [[suicide]] of another young child who was under his care.  Jake gradually befriends Tim. At first, Jake thinks that Tim is trying to communicate by cutting up playing cards, but Sylvie reveals that Tim is good at mimicking voices. Jake is able to trigger Tim's memory so that Tim mimics the voices he heard on the night of the murder by using the trigger phrase "God Damn," which were the first words Tim heard from the murder. He attempts to piece together the chronology of the murder, suspecting that Tim interrupted a fight between his parents and an intruder.  Sheriff Mitch Rivers threatens to use drugs to get Tim to talk about the murder and Dr. Rene Harlinger successfully hypnotizes Tim into breaking down a locked door. The police chief, seeing this as proof of Tim's strength, concludes that Tim was the murderer, after finding photographs showing that Tim's father was molesting him.  That night, Sylvie plans to take Tim away and attempts to convince Jake to run away with them. She fails, and instead paralyzes Jake and throws him into an icy lake to drown him. Tim mimics the police chief's voice over the phone to lure Sylvie to the police station and pulls Jake out of the lake while she is away.  Sylvie returns and Jake reveals that he has solved the mystery by examining Tim's cut up playing cards.

Five years later, his only companion is a valuable collection of gold coins. But his heart is hurt again when Tanny Newland, the unsavory younger brother of politician John Newland, crashes his brother's car in the woods surrounding Michael's house, seriously injuring the woman he is with. Afraid of being arrested for drunk driving, Tanny steals Michael's coins while he's sleeping, takes off into the night and is never seen again.  Weeks later during a winter storm, Michael is startled to discover a toddler has wandered into his home while he was outside gathering wood. A short distance away he discovers the body of her mother, a [[heroin]] [[Substance dependence|addict]] whose car had run out of gas nearby. Unbeknownst to him, the child is the illegitimate daughter of John Newland, who participates in the investigation but keeps his relationship to the child a secret in order to protect his career.  Michael is permitted to adopt the child and christens her Mathilda. She proves to be a bit of a handful in her early years, but with the help of friend and local shopkeeper April Simon, Michael manages to raise her to be a bright, personable, precocious young lady, and the once sour, lonely man is transformed by her presence. As John Newland watches his daughter grow older, he begins to invite her to join him and wife Nancy in their home. John arranges for her to learn to ride a horse, eventually giving her one of her own.  Due to Nancy's two miscarriages and the couple's deep desire to have a child, Nancy insists on adoption. John finally reveals Mathilda's true identity and his desire to adopt her properly. Nancy encourages him to gain custody of the girl, and a trial ensues.  Although the lawyer tries to manipulate the court and Mathilda herself to see that the Newlands are the better parents, Mathilda herself still refuses and honestly prefers Michael. The judge is inclined to side with the Newlands, given their wealth and ability to provide Mathilda with advantages she never would have with Michael. Then the remains of Tanny Newland - surrounded by the gold coins he stole from Michael - are found at the bottom of the quarry his brother was draining to create a lake surrounded by real estate he planned to sell.  Michael's sudden return to wealth - and the judge's realization that Newland's only legal argument has fallen apart - convinces him that Mathilda should remain with Michael, who loves her as a real father would love his daughter. The film ends with Michael taking Mathilda to visit her late mother's grave, in a remote potter's cemetery. She leaves a message for her mother, which ends the movie with the same emotion it began with; parents and children have a bond that transcends time.

Sirens (1994 film)
 Tony, an [[Anglican ministry|Anglican priest]] newly arrived in Australia from the United Kingdom, is asked to visit the notorious artist [[Norman Lindsay]], out of the [[Anglican Church of Australia|church's]] concern about a blasphemous painting of the crucifix that the artist plans to exhibit.  Estella, the priest's wife, accompanies him on the visit to the artist's bucolic compound in the Blue Mountains, New South Wales. There, they meet Lindsay's wife, Rose, two models, and the maid, all of whom pose for Lindsay. Devlin, the half-blind "odd-job" man, also poses for Lindsay.  Initially, Tony and Estella are both disturbed by the frank conversations about human sexuality in which the members of the bohemian group all participate. They are further startled by the amount of nudity they encounter, both in the studio and outside. As the story unfolds, both Tony and Estella find themselves observing the young women bathing naked in a nearby pool and instead of turning instantly away, each pauses to watch, betraying an underlying sensual interest in the lifestyle they outwardly deplore.  Joining the models to swim one morning, Estella is shocked when they bathe naked (she and the maid have come in swimming costumes). Estella is further shocked when Devlin arrives on the scene and the naked women flirt with him, knowing that he cannot see them. On a later occasion, Estella observes the two models caressing the maid, and joins them in stroking her. She doesn't realize that her husband, walking nearby, observes this and is disturbed by the scene's sexual content. At another time, Estella observes Devlin sunbathing naked, and flees when she realises he knows she is there.  Estella is increasingly affected by the sensuality of her surroundings and the bohemian attitude towards sexuality. Her relationship with her husband includes intimacy and commitment, but lacks passion.  The surroundings and the lives of the models are [[Siren (mythology)|siren]] calls that lead Estella to fantasize with increasing intensity, and (with encouragement from the models) act on a few of her impulses. She suffers morning-after remorse about a late-night visit to Devlin. Influenced by supportive words from her husband, who had witnessed her earlier intimacy with the models, Estella shares a passionate moment with her husband.  While Tony is outraged to discover his wife's naked likeness included in one of Lindsay's paintings of a group of naked women, Estella merely observes that it is a good likeness, thus deflating her husband's moral outrage and threats to sue.

Speed (1994 film)
   [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) [[SWAT]] officers Jack Traven and Harry Temple thwart an attempt to hold an elevator full of people for a $3 million ransom by a bomber, who is later revealed to be named Howard Payne. As they corner Payne, he grabs Harry. Jack shoots Harry in the leg, forcing the bomber to release Harry. Payne turns away, appearing to die in the explosion of his own device. Jack and Harry are praised by Lieutenant "Mac" McMahon and awarded medals for bravery.  Some time later, Jack witnesses a city bus explode. Payne, still alive, contacts Jack on a payphone, explaining that a similar bomb is rigged on another bus. The bomb will arm once the bus reaches  and detonate when it drops below 50. The bomber demands a larger ransom of $3.7 million and threatens to detonate the bus if passengers are offloaded. Jack races through freeway traffic and boards the moving bus, which is already over 50&nbsp;mph. He explains the situation to the driver Sam, but a small-time criminal, fearing Jack is about to arrest him, fires his gun, accidentally wounding Sam. Another passenger, Annie Porter, takes the wheel. Jack examines the bomb under the bus and phones Harry, who uses clues to identify the bomber.  The police clear a route for the bus to the unopened [[Interstate 105 (California)|105 freeway]]. Mac demands they offload the passengers onto a pacing flatbed truck, but Jack warns about Payne's instructions. Payne allows the officers to offload the injured Sam for medical attention, but then detonates a smaller bomb which kills another passenger who attempts to escape.  When Jack learns that part of the elevated freeway ahead is incomplete, he persuades Annie to accelerate the bus and jump the gap. He directs her to the nearby [[Los Angeles International Airport]] to drive on the unobstructed runways. Meanwhile, Harry identifies Payne's name, his former role as a retired Atlanta bomb squad officer, and his local Los Angeles address. Harry leads a SWAT team to Payne's home, but the house is rigged with explosives which go off, killing Harry and most of his team in the process.  Jack rides under the bus on a towed sledge, but he cannot defuse the bomb, and accidentally punctures the fuel tanks when the sledge breaks from its tow line. Once pulled back aboard by the passengers, Jack learns that Harry has died and that Payne has been watching the passengers on the bus with a hidden camcorder. Mac has a local news crew record the transmission and rebroadcast it in a loop to fool Payne, while the passengers are offloaded onto an airport bus. The bus suffers a flat tire, forcing Jack and Annie to escape via a floor access panel. Out of fuel, the bus slows to 50&nbsp;mph and explodes as it collides with an empty Boeing 707 cargo plane.  Jack and Mac head to [[Pershing Square (Los Angeles)|Pershing Square]] to drop the ransom into a waste can. Realizing he has been fooled, Payne poses as a police officer and seizes Annie and the money. Jack follows them into the Metro [[Red Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Red Line]] subway, where Annie is wearing a [[Suicide vest|vest covered with explosives]] rigged to a [[dead man's switch|pressure-release detonator]]. Payne hijacks a subway train, handcuffs Annie to a pole, and sets the train in motion while Jack pursues them. After killing the train driver, Payne attempts a bribe with the ransom money but is enraged when a [[dye pack]] in the money bag goes off. He and Jack fight  on the roof of the train, until Payne is decapitated by an overhead light [[railway signal|signal]].  Jack removes the vest from Annie, but she is still handcuffed. Realizing Payne killed the driver and shot the control panel at the same time, rendering the controls unusable, Jack accelerates the train, causing it to smash through an end-of-track construction site and burst onto [[Hollywood Boulevard]] before coming to a stop. Finally finished with the adventure, Jack and Annie share a kiss.

The Specialist
 In 1984, Captain Ray Quick ([[Sylvester Stallone|Stallone]]) and Colonel Ned Trent ([[James Woods|Woods]]), explosives experts working for the [[CIA]], are on a mission to blow up a car transporting a [[South America]]n drug dealer. But when the car appears, a little girl is inside with the dealer. Ray insists they abort the mission, but Ned intends to see it through and allows the explosion to happen, resulting in the deaths of both the drug dealer and the child. Furious by the girl's wrongful death, Ray savagely beats Ned and flees, effectively resigning from the CIA.  Years later, in [[Miami]], Ray works as a freelance hit man. Desperate people contact him via an Internet bulletin board and he takes the cases that interest him. Ray specializes in "shaping" his explosions, building and planting bombs that blow up only the intended target while leaving innocent bystanders unharmed.  He answers ads placed by a woman named May Munro ([[Sharon Stone|Stone]]) and speaks to her often to decide if he should take the job or not. During the talks he becomes intrigued by her story, coupled with the fact that he sees how attractive she is while following her. She is the only child of parents who were killed by Tomas Leon ([[Eric Roberts|Roberts]]) and his men. Against his better judgment, and pushed by her insistence that she will infiltrate the gang with or without him, Ray is persuaded to accept the job. Even though he has agreed, May ingratiates herself into Tomas' world as Adrian Hastings.  Ned now works for Joe Leon ([[Rod Steiger|Steiger]]), Tomas' father and director of their mafia organization. Once the hits on their lower level guys begin, they contact the chief of police to place Ned in their bomb squad. May tolerates Tomas and plays along as his girlfriend so she can watch the hits one by one. It is revealed after the second target is killed that May has actually been forced into a partnership with Ned, whose goal was to coax Ray out of hiding. After the job in South America went wrong, Ned was dismissed from the CIA and is intent on revenge.  When the trap for Tomas is set, May is in the room; the resulting explosion appears to kill them both. When Ned goes to Joe to pay his respects, he is left alive only so he can find Ray and bring him to Joe before Tomas is buried. Both Ray and Ned believe that May is dead, yet Ray discovers that bulletin board messages are still being posted. He responds to one, quickly realizing that it is a trap set by Ned and the bomb squad, and baits Ned into an explosive tirade.  When he goes to the funeral of Adrian Hastings, Ray finds that May is alive. She went to the funeral to see if Ray would attend. They go to the [[Fontainebleau Hotel]] where they fornicate, after which she leaves. Meanwhile, Ned has gone to the cathedral and learns that the person in the casket is not May. She runs into Ned in the hotel lobby and makes an excuse as to why she did not tell him that she was alive. A henchman is ordered to take her to the car and on the way she asks to use the restroom. Once there, she uses a cell phone to warn Ray. He rigs the hotel room to explode, and when Ned's henchmen enter the room it detonates, breaking the entire room off into the ocean.  In a final showdown, Ray and May are cornered in Ray's own booby-trapped warehouse. Ned pursues them, but is done in by his own hubris when he steps on a bomb. After the entire warehouse goes up due to the chain of bombs exploding, it appears that all inside have been killed.  The next day Joe reads about the incident at the warehouse. He then opens the mail brought to him and finds a necklace. It contains a picture of May's parents, which then explodes. After hearing the blast and knowing all responsible for her parents' death are dead, Ray asks how she feels, to which she responds, "Better."

Star Trek Generations
 In the year 2293, retired Captain [[James T. Kirk]], [[Montgomery Scott]] and [[Pavel Chekov]] attend the [[maiden voyage]] of the Federation starship [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-B)|USS ''Enterprise''-B]], under the command of the unseasoned Captain [[John Harriman (Star Trek)|John Harriman]]. During the voyage, ''Enterprise'', having left [[Earth Spacedock]] without being fully equipped, is pressed into a rescue mission to save two [[El-Aurian]] ships from a strange energy ribbon. ''Enterprise'' is able to save some of the refugees before their ships are destroyed, but the starship becomes trapped in the ribbon. Kirk goes to deflector control to alter the deflector dish, allowing ''Enterprise'' to escape, but the trailing end of the ribbon rakes across ''Enterprise''s hull, exposing the section Kirk is in to space; he is presumed dead.  78 years later, in 2371, the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise''-D]] celebrate the promotion of [[Worf]] to Lieutenant Commander. Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] receives a message that his brother and nephew were killed in a fire. Since Picard never fathered children of his own, the family line will end with him. ''Enterprise'' receives a distress call from an observatory in orbit of the star Amargosa, where they rescue the El-Aurian Dr. Tolian Soran. The android [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] and engineer [[Geordi La Forge]] discover a compound called trilithium in a hidden room of the observatory. Soran appears, knocks La Forge unconscious, and launches a trilithium solar probe at Amargosa. The probe causes the star to implode, sending a shock wave toward the observatory. Soran and La Forge are transported away by a [[Klingon starships#Bird of Prey classes|Klingon Bird of Prey]] belonging to the treacherous [[List of Star Trek: The Next Generation characters#Lursa and B'Etor|Duras sisters]], who had stolen the trilithium for Soran in exchange for the designs for a trilithium weapon. Data is rescued just before the station is destroyed by the shock wave.  [[Guinan (Star Trek)|Guinan]], ''Enterprise''s bartender hostess, tells Picard more about Soran; they were among the El-Aurians rescued by the ''Enterprise''-B in 2293. Guinan explains that Soran is obsessed with reentering the ribbon, which is a portal to the "Nexus", an extra-dimensional realm where time has no meaning and anyone can experience whatever they desire. Picard and Data determine that Soran, unable to fly a ship into the ribbon due to the uncertainty that the ship will survive long enough to ensure his success, is instead altering the path of the ribbon by destroying stars, which alters gravitational forces in the neighborhood, and that he will attempt to reenter the Nexus on Veridian III by destroying its sun—and, by extension, Veridian IV's quarter-billion inhabitants.  Upon entering the Veridian system, ''Enterprise'' makes contact with the Duras Bird of Prey. Picard offers himself to the sisters in exchange for La Forge, but insists that he be transported to Soran's location first. La Forge is returned to ''Enterprise'', but with a small camera implanted in his VISOR. This causes him to inadvertently reveal ''Enterprise''s shield frequency, allowing the Duras sisters to fire weapons directly through the shields and inflict crippling damage on ''Enterprise''. ''Enterprise'' destroys the Bird of Prey, but has sustained irreversible damage to its warp core. Commander [[William Riker]] orders an evacuation to the forward saucer section of the ship which separates from the star drive. The shock wave from the star drive's destruction sends the saucer crashing to the surface of Veridian III.  Picard fails to talk Soran out of his plan and is too late to stop him from launching his missile. The collapse of the Veridian star alters the course of the Nexus ribbon as predicted, and it sweeps Picard and Soran away while the shock wave from the star obliterates everything in the system. In the Nexus, Picard finds himself surrounded by the family he never had, including a wife and children, but realizes it is an illusion. He is confronted by an "echo" of Guinan. After being told that he may leave whenever he chooses and go wherever and ''whenever'' he wishes, Guinan sends him to meet Kirk, also safe in the Nexus. Though Kirk is at first reluctant to leave, he likewise comes to the eventual realization that nothing in the Nexus is real. Picard convinces Kirk to return to Veridian III, rather than earlier at Amargosa, assuring him that stopping Soran will fulfill his desire to make a difference.  The two leave the Nexus, with Picard choosing to have them arrive on Veridian III only minutes before Soran launches the missile. Kirk distracts Soran long enough for Picard to lock the missile in place, causing it to explode on the launchpad and kill Soran. Kirk is fatally injured by a fall during the encounter; as he dies, Picard assures him that he made a difference. Picard buries Kirk on a hillside before a shuttle arrives to transport him to the wreckage of the ''Enterprise'' saucer. Three Federation starships enter orbit to retrieve ''Enterprise''s survivors, but the ship itself cannot be salvaged. As Riker laments that he will never sit in the Captain's chair of the ship, Picard muses that given the name's legacy, this won't be the last ship to carry the name ''Enterprise''.  
Stargate (film)
 [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] and [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson, Ph.D.]], are invited by Catherine Langford to translate [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] on [[cover stone]]s that her father had unearthed in [[Giza]], [[Egypt]] in 1928. Jackson is taken to a [[U.S. Air Force]] installation and told the project is [[classified information]] by its commander [[Special Operations]] Colonel [[Jack O'Neill|Jack O'Neil]]. Jackson determines that the hieroglyphs refer to a "stargate" which uses [[constellations]] as spatial coordinates. On this revelation, Jackson is shown that the base has this Stargate, also discovered by Langford's father. They use Jackson's coordinates to align the Stargate's metal ring with markings along its outside, and once all seven are locked in, a [[wormhole]] opens, connecting the Stargate with a distant planet. Jackson joins O'Neil and other soldiers as they pass through the wormhole.  On the arid desert planet,  [[List of recurring alien characters in Stargate SG-1#Abydonians| Abydos]], they find themselves in a [[pyramid]]-like structure. Jackson locates the Stargate's controls, but lacks the coordinates to return home. O'Neil orders some of his men to stay behind to guard the Stargate. Nearby, they discover a tribe of humans working to mine a strange mineral from the planet. Jackson is able to communicate with them as they speak a variation of [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]], and finds the tribe sees them as [[wikt:emissary|emissaries]] of their god [[Ra]] ([[Jaye Davidson]]). The tribe's chieftain Kasuf presents Jackson with his daughter [[Sha'uri]] as a gift, and though Jackson initially refuses her, he later becomes romantically attached to her. O'Neil befriends Kasuf's teenaged son Skaara and his friends, in part because Skaara reminds him of his long-deceased son who had shot himself with O'Neil's service weapon. Through hidden markings and discussions with the tribe, Jackson learns that Ra is an alien being who had come to Earth during the Ancient Egyptian period, looking to possess human bodies to extend his own life. Ra enslaved these humans and brought some to this planet through the Stargate to mine the mineral that is used in the alien technology. The humans on Earth revolted, overthrew Ra's overseers, and buried the Stargate to prevent its use. Ra forbade the humans in the tribe from becoming literate, fearing another revolt. During this investigation, Jackson comes across a [[cartouche]] containing six of the seven symbols for the Stargate, but the seventh has been broken off.  That night, Ra's ship lands atop the pyramid structure, and O'Neil's men there are captured or killed by Ra's soldiers. When Jackson, O'Neil, and the other men return, they end up in a firefight against Ra's soldiers; Jackson is killed and the others are captured. Ra places Jackson's body in a [[sarcophagus]]-like device that regenerates him. Ra then explains to Jackson that he has found a nuclear bomb O'Neil secretly brought with him, has used his alien technology to increase its explosive power a hundred-fold, and threatens to send it back through the Stargate. Ra orders the human tribe to watch as he prepares to force Jackson to execute the others to demonstrate his power, but Skaara and his friends create a diversion that allows Jackson, O'Neil, and the others to escape. They flee to nearby caves to hide from Ra. Skaara and his friends celebrate, and Skaara draws out a sign of victory in a wall, which Jackson recognizes as the final symbol.  O'Neil and his men aid Skaara in overthrowing the remaining overseers, and then launch an attack on Ra. Ra sends out fighter ships against the humans while he orders his ship to depart. The humans outside are forced to surrender to the fighter ships' pilots when they run out of ammunition, but the rest of the tribe, having the true nature of their false gods revealed by Jackson, rebel against the pilots and overthrow them. Sha'uri is killed, but Jackson takes her body and sneaks aboard Ra's ship using a teleportation system, leaving O'Neil to fight Ra's guard captain, Anubis. Jackson places Sha'uri in the regeneration device, and she recovers, but Ra discovers them and attempts to kill Jackson. O'Neil activates the teleportation system, killing Anubis and allowing Jackson and Sha'uri to escape the ship. O'Neil and Jackson use the teleporter to transport the bomb to Ra's ship; the ensuing blast destroys the ship in space. With the humans freed, the remaining team returns to Earth, and Jackson stays behind with Sha'uri and the others.   ===Director's cut=== The [[director's cut]] had several scenes which were cut from the theatrical release. The first such scene took place immediately after the excavation of the Stargate in 1928 and showed [[Petrification|petrified]] [[Horus]] guards near the cover stones; the producers had tried to introduce the idea that beings had attempted to come through the Stargate after its burial, but they cut the scene for time concerns.<ref name="acdevlin" />  
The Stand (miniseries)
 On June 13, at a top-secret government laboratory in rural [[California]], a weaponized version of [[influenza]] is accidentally released. A guard escapes the lab and begins traveling across the country to his family home in [[East Texas]], unintentionally spreading the virus along the way. On June 17th, he crashes his car into a gas station in the town of Arnette, where Stu Redman ([[Gary Sinise]]) and some friends have gathered. As the man lays dying, he warns Redman that he had been pursued by a "Dark Man.” The next day, the U.S. military arrives to quarantine the town.  The townspeople are taken to a [[Centers for Disease Control|CDC]] facility in [[Vermont]]. All but Stu succumb to the superflu, which kills 99.4% of the world's population in two weeks. The scattered survivors include would-be rock star Larry Underwood ([[Adam Storke]]); [[deaf mute]] Nick Andros ([[Rob Lowe]]); Frannie Goldsmith ([[Molly Ringwald]]) and her unborn child from Jesse, her boyfriend prior to the plague; her teenaged neighbor Harold Lauder ([[Corin Nemec]]); imprisoned criminal Lloyd Henreid ([[Miguel Ferrer]]); and "Trashcan Man" ([[Matt Frewer]]), a mentally ill [[arson]]ist and scavenger. The survivors soon begin having visions, either from kindly Mother Abagail ([[Ruby Dee]]) or from the demonic [[Randall Flagg]] ([[Jamey Sheridan]]). The two sets of survivors are instructed in dreams to either travel to [[Nebraska]] to meet Abagail, or to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to join Flagg.  As their journeys begin, Lloyd is freed from prison by Flagg in exchange for becoming his second in command. Trashcan Man, a [[pyromaniac]], destroys fuel tanks across the Midwest and is directed to Las Vegas. Larry escapes [[New York City]] with a mysterious woman named Nadine Cross ([[Laura San Giacomo]]). Despite their mutual attraction, Nadine is unable to consummate a relationship with Larry because of her visions of Flagg, who commands her to join him; she leaves Larry to travel on her own. After escaping the CDC facility, Stu gathers a group of survivors, including Frannie, Harold, and Glen Bateman ([[Ray Walston]]). They are later joined by various other immune survivors.  As the group travels toward Nebraska, Harold is consumed with jealousy over Stu's leadership of the group and his growing relationship with Frannie, on whom Harold has an unrequited crush. Meanwhile, Nick makes his way across the Midwest, eventually meeting Tom Cullen ([[Bill Fagerbakke]]), a mentally challenged man. The two men encounter Julie Lawry ([[Shawnee Smith]]), a vicious girl who vows to kill them when they refuse to let her join them. Eventually Nick's group reaches Abagail's farm in [[Hemingford, Nebraska|Hemingford Home, Nebraska]]. She warns that a great conflict is imminent and they must all travel on to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Colorado]]. There, the survivors form a new community called the Boulder Free Zone, where they begin restoring civilization.   Flagg sets up an [[autocracy|autocratic]] regime in Las Vegas, with the intent of defeating the Boulder survivors using salvaged [[nuclear weapon]]s. Frannie feels increasing anxiety because she is unsure whether her baby will be immune to the superflu. Harold's resentment towards Stu and Frannie intensifies, causing him to be seduced by Nadine and join forces with Flagg. Abagail, convinced that she has fallen into the sin of [[pride]], leaves Boulder to [[Catholic spirituality#Desert spirituality|walk in the wilderness]]. Three Boulder survivors are chosen to infiltrate Las Vegas: Tom, Dayna Jurgens ([[Kellie Overbey]]), and Judge Farris ([[Ossie Davis]]). They hypnotize Tom to follow a set of instructions, including that he leave Las Vegas at the next full moon.  Harold and Nadine plant a bomb in Frannie and Stu's home, planning to set it off during a meeting of the Free Zone council. A weakened Abagail returns to town and gives a psychic warning to the council members at the meeting. The warning allows most of the council to escape the explosion, but Nick is killed. Before she passes away, Abagail tells Stu, Larry, Glen, Frannie and fellow council member Ralph Brentner that they must travel to Las Vegas to confront Flagg. When Nadine and Harold flee, Flagg causes Harold to be seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. Nadine leaves him with broken legs. He kills himself with a gun the next day. Flagg calls Nadine to him. She tries to escape and tells him no when he wants to consummate their relationship. Flagg tells her it is too late to say no and forces himself on her. Nadine is unresponsive following the attack by Flagg. Upon returning to Las Vegas, an increasingly unstable Flagg finds Dayna, who kills herself rather than give up information. He intercepts Farris, who is accidentally killed before he can be tortured.  Tom leaves Las Vegas when the moon is full, but Julie recognizes him; she tries to alert Flagg, but Tom escapes into the desert and hides from Flagg and his men. Shortly afterwards, a crazed Nadine taunts Flagg and commits suicide with the unholy fetus he conceived in her. With winter fast approaching, Stu, Larry, Glen, and Ralph leave Boulder to set out on their quest. Stu breaks his leg and must stay behind. The remaining three are captured by Flagg's forces. Glen is separated from Larry and Ralph. Flagg orders Lloyd to kill Glen after he taunts Flagg. As Larry and Ralph endure a [[show trial]] on [[Fremont Street]], Trashcan Man arrives with a stolen nuclear weapon. Flagg is unable to stop a spectral hand from detonating the bomb as the voice of Abagail declares that God's promise has been kept. Las Vegas is destroyed and Flagg is apparently killed.  Stu is rescued by Tom, who takes him to a nearby cabin to heal his leg as winter sets in. They eventually return to Boulder in the midst of a blinding snow storm. Frannie gives birth to a baby which is determined to have the superflu, but the infant survives. Assured that the immune survivors can safely reproduce, the inhabitants of Boulder set to work rebuilding the world.

Honda]] and boxer [[Balrog (Street Fighter)|Balrog]], who are also out for revenge against Sagat for ruining their careers, stumble across the plan, and over Guile's objections, attempt to assassinate the two warlords at a party. To maintain Bison's trust, Ryu and Ken stop the assassination and reveal the conspirators to Bison.  Returning to his base, Bison inducts Ryu and Ken into his organization and orders Honda and Balrog imprisoned and Chun-Li taken to his quarters. Ryu and Ken break Balrog and Honda out of confinement and rush to confront Bison, who is fighting Chun-Li, but Bison escapes and releases sleeping gas, sedating them all. Guile plans his assault on Bison's base. He is impeded by the Deputy Secretary of the A.N., who informs Guile that the decision has been made to pay Bison the ransom, but Guile proceeds with the mission alone. At the base, Dhalsim is found out by a security guard, and a fight ensues. Charlie is released and he kills the guard to protect Dhalsim. Guile arrives and sneaks into the lab, where Charlie attacks him. Charlie stops when he recognizes Guile. Guile prepares to shoot Charlie to end his suffering, but Dhalsim stops him. Bison prepares to kill the hostages by unleashing Charlie on them, but Guile emerges and a gunfight ensues until the remaining A.N. forces arrive. After ordering the his allies to rescue the hostages, Guile engages Bison in a personal duel. As Guile and Bison fight, Ryu and Ken defeat Sagat and Vega. Bison's computer expert [[Dee Jay]] steals Bison's money and escapes, joined by Sagat, while Bison's bodyguard, [[Zangief]], engages Honda in a fight until learning from Dee Jay that Bison was the true enemy, and sides with Ryu and Ken.  Guile gains the upper hand against Bison and kicks him into a bank of hard drives, electrocuting him. A revival system restores Bison and he reveals that his suit is powered by electromagnetism, enabling him to fly and fire electricity. Bison takes control of the fight and moves to deal the death blow, but Guile counters by kicking Bison into his monitor wall, finishing him off and overloading the base's energy field. The hostages are rescued, but Guile stays behind to convince Dhalsim and Charlie to return with him. They refuse, with Dhalsim wishing to atone for his part in mutating Charlie. Guile escapes as the base explodes and reunites with his comrades, while Sagat and Dee Jay realize Bison's money was the useless "Bison Dollars" that Bison had intended to use after conquering the world.  
Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie
 In the prologue, a fight between Japanese martial artist [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]] and Muay Thai champion [[Sagat (Street Fighter)|Sagat]] rages until Ryu severely scars Sagat across the chest with a ''Shoryuken''. Sagat vows revenge against Ryu.  Years later, following the assassination of a Justice Minister by [[Cammy]], a hypnotized MI6 Agent, Interpol agent [[Chun-Li]] suggests that they join forces with the [[United States Military]] to destroy the enigmatic crime syndicate known as [[Shadowlaw]]. Captain [[Guile (Street Fighter)|Guile]], who is out for revenge against Shadowlaw's leader, [[M. Bison]], for the death of [[Charlie (Street Fighter)|his best friend]], refuses, but eventually relents when Chun-Li tells him that Bison killed her father years ago and she herself wants revenge, but knows that her duty comes first. At the Shadowlaw base, Bison, along with his bodyguards [[Balrog (Street Fighter)|Balrog]], [[Vega (Street Fighter)|Vega]], and Sagat, orders a worldwide manhunt for Ryu, determined to induct him into his organization, and sends out hundreds of monitor cyborgs to find more valuable martial artists for their cause. However, Ryu, who is traveling the world to seek out worthy challengers, such as [[Fei-Long]], [[Dhalsim]], and [[E. Honda]], remains undetected due to suppressing his Ki.  Meanwhile, Ryu's American best friend and fighting rival, [[Ken Masters]], has settled down with his girlfriend, Eliza, but still yearns for a good challenge and desires a rematch with Ryu. During a tussle with [[T. Hawk]], who had sought out Ken to challenge him, Ken is seen by a monitor cyborg and the footage of the fight is sent to the Shadowlaw base. Bison sees the footage and learns of Ken's history with Ryu, and decides to hunt him down and hypnotize him in Ryu's stead. Along the way, Bison sees Chun-Li and Guile warning [[Dee Jay]] about the monitor cyborgs and destroying one in the process, and subsequently sends Vega to New York to kill Chun-Li. Vega ambushes Chun-Li in her apartment, but after a bloody fight, Chun-Li knocks Vega through the wall of the building and he falls to his death, yet she is badly wounded and falls into a coma. Guile arrives and rushes her to the hospital. He also learns of Ryu and Ken from Interpol, and after learning that Bison has captured Ken, Guile rushes to Thailand to warn Ryu, who is training in the mountains with E. Honda.  Bison, however, follows Guile and confronts them. He sets the hypnotized Ken on Ryu, who initially refuses to fight back. Honda battles Balrog while Guile faces Bison and is severely beaten, though Bison spares his life as a final insult. As Ryu prepares to retaliate against Ken, memories of their past wreak havoc on Ken's mind and he manages to break free of Bison's mind control. The enraged Bison unleashes his Psycho Power upon Ken and casts him afar before turning his attention to Ryu, who fights Bison with very little success. Ken uses his master's Ki teachings to mend his body and joins the fight. With their combined forces, Ryu and Ken eventually pummel Bison into submission and hurl a joint ''Hadouken'' at him, apparently destroying him. Honda defeats Balrog and rescues Guile.  The United States Military locate and destroy Bison's base. Chun-Li makes a full recovery and reunites with Guile in the hospital, informing him that their mission was a success. Elsewhere, Ryu and Ken part ways once again and Ryu begins his journey anew. However, he is ambushed from behind by a huge truck, with the driver revealed to be Bison, who survived the battle. The film closes as Ryu leaps towards the truck to fight Bison again.  A [[Post-credits scene|post-credits message]] promotes a Japan Spring 1995 release for the ''[[Street Fighter (1994 film)|Street Fighter]]'' live-action film, starring [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] and the late [[Raul Julia]].  
The Stoned Age
 The story takes place in [[Torrance, California]], sometime in the late 1970s.  A pugilistic ex-convict known as "Crump's Brother" is picked up by a local teen while hitchhiking on the freeway and informs him about two women he intends to party with in [[Torrance, California|Torrance Beach]]. The teen then informs his friends about the situation, but no one wishes to anger Crump's Brother by tagging along.  Joe and Hubbs, as they drive around town in their 1973 [[Volkswagen Type 3]] Squareback, The "Blue Torpedo" looking for drugs and women. They come across Tack, who informs them of the girls. Their friend Crump, the gas station attendant, also tells them of the girls. They strand Tack at the gas station, and head for Torrance Beach.  They arrive at the house and find an extremely attractive girl named Lanie who sends them off to a liquor store for alcohol. When they return, they find the homeowner's daughter Jill, a misanthropic hippie girl who is Lanie's friend. In the meantime, Tack conscripts his nerdy friend Norm "Snot-rag" Hankey to take him to the beach. They arrive at the house and after a brief scuffle, Tack entices cooperation with news of a party in [[Palos Verdes]], much to Joe and Hubbs' chagrin.  At the house party, Muldoon, the party host, lets the girls in but shuts everyone else out. Lanie leaves following an altercation with Muldoon and drafts Joe to take her swimming in a neighbor's pool. The police shut down the party, and Hubbs and Jill locate Joe and Lanie next door. Lanie is smitten with Hubbs' aggressive nature, much to Joe's chagrin, and the two walk upstairs for sex.  Having lost their beer to the police, Tack and the others raid a liquor warehouse for beer, and head for the house. Joe and Jill partially reconcile but return to find Tack and the Guzzlers converging on the home. A fight breaks out between Joe and Tack and Jill runs inside, eventually letting Joe back in and locking the door.  After getting stoned, Hubbs tells Joe he's arranged for Lanie to give him [[fellatio]] as a "birthday present". Joe finds that Lanie asleep, covers her up, and walks out; he finds Hubbs with Jill making out on the couch; Joe is upset but learns that Jill was the instigator. They are interrupted when Crump's Brother arrives outside and begins to break down the door. They flee to the kitchen but shortly afterwards, they hear the commotion dying out; Jill's father, Warren, has returned from a college reunion and beaten the entire crowd of kids—including Crump's Brother—to unconsciousness with great ease. While Hubbs manages to escape by jumping through a window on the upper floor, Warren retains Joe and holds him hostage awaiting the arrival of the police. Eventually, a condescending lecture provokes a fight and Joe and Hubbs dramatically escape just ahead of the police. Enamored with Joe, Jill gives him her full name and geographical location ("north") so he can look her up later.  The police arrest the entire crew of drunken teenagers, and Joe and Hubbs escape in the "Blue Torpedo". Hubbs jocularly chides Joe for his apparent cowardice in moving on Lanie and Jill, and dismisses Jill as a viable partner. Joe, no longer tolerant of Hubb's attitude, wrestles a surprised Hubbs into submission while driving and forces him to capitulate that Jill is "cool". Joe then places the [[Blue Öyster Cult]] [[8-track tape|8-track]] tape into the deck and plays "[[(Don't Fear) the Reaper]]". The song plays as the Blue Torpedo drives off through the night.  Following the credits, Joe and Hubbs are offered Blue Öyster Cult concert T-shirts outside a convenience store by two men, but Joe refuses because the shirts are bootlegs, and not official. The scalpers are played by actual Blue Öyster Cult band members [[Eric Bloom]] and [[Donald "Buck Dharma" Roeser]].

Despite warnings from Rex, the outgoing assistant who has become hardened under Buddy's reign, Guy remains optimistic.

Surviving the Game
 Jack Mason is a homeless man from [[Seattle]] who loses his only friends—Hank, a fellow homeless man and his pet dog—on the same day. Dejected, Mason attempts to commit suicide when a soup kitchen worker, Walter Cole, saves him. Cole refers the man to businessman Thomas Burns, who kindly offers Mason a job as a hunting guide. Despite his misgivings, the lure of a well paying job causes Mason to accept.  Flying to a remote cabin surrounded by hundreds of acres of woods, Mason meets the rest of the hunting party, all of whom paid $50,000 for the privilege of being there. The party includes Doc Hawkins, the founder of the hunt, a psychotic psychiatrist who specializes in psychological assessments, Cole, [[Texas]] "oil man" John Griffin, wealthy executive Derek Wolfe Sr. and his son Derek Wolfe Jr., who is at first unaware of the true purposes of the hunt. The first night all the men are eating a nice dinner and engaging in conversation. Mason receives a pack of [[cigarette]]s from Hawkins and learns a little history about the man. Hawkins relays a brutal story from his childhood when his father forced him to train and then fight his dog as a lesson in being a man.  The following morning Mason is awakened with a gun in his face by Cole, who explains that the men are not hunting any animals, but rather Mason himself. Mason is given a head start with only the time it takes the others to eat [[breakfast]]. Mason quickly flees the area, but comes to a realization and turns back. The hunters finish their meal and set off after him. Wolfe Jr. is horrified at the thought of killing a man, but is pushed into it by his father. The hunters race off into the forest, but by now Mason has returned to the cabin in search of weapons. He finds none, and instead makes the disgusting discovery of the hunters trophy room behind a locked door: the preserved heads of the victims of previous hunts.  Mason decides to burn it down using chemicals found outside the cabin. The hunters quickly assume Mason's return to the cabin and go back. Wolfe Sr. enters just as Mason lights up the cabin and engages in a fist fight with Hawkins out back, away from the others. Hawkins is knocked back into the cabin as the preserving agent explodes, killing him in the inferno. Wolfe Jr. saves his father, and spots Mason fleeing in the process. The hunt resumes and Mason begins to use his wits to beat the hunters, luring them with falsely-planted lit cigarettes to lead them in the wrong way. Mason manages to lure Griffin away from the others, and takes him [[hostage]].  Over the night, Mason learns why Griffin is taking part in the hunt. Years earlier his daughter was murdered by a homeless man and he's venting his rage. Mason, in turn, relays his own tragic tale of losing his family in an [[apartment]] [[fire]]. This leads Griffin to have a change of heart in the morning. Upon rescuing him, Griffin reveals his decision to not continue the hunting, but is murdered by Burns to prevent any future legal conflicts. By now, with their numbers dwindling, the remaining hunters seem more intent on killing Mason.  Mason sabotages one of their [[all terrain vehicle|ATV]]s, causing it to explode.  The explosion rips off most of Cole's lower body mortally wounding him. Burns then uses his fingers to apply pressure to Cole's jugulars in order to kill him and spare him from the pain. As they pursue Mason, Wolfe Jr. is killed by accident when he falls in a ravine, and Wolfe Sr. vows revenge in a fit of rage.  The second night sees Wolfe Sr. and Mason fighting one on one with Mason the victor and Burns escaping to the [[city]] knowing that Mason will most likely be searching for him. Days later, Burns is back in [[Seattle, Washington]], preparing to leave his current identity, hoping to escape both Mason and the legal responsibilities resulting from the disastrous hunt. But Mason has escaped the [[forest]], returned to the city and tracked him down. A quick fight ensues, but Mason chooses not to kill him. Instead he walks away, but Burns attempts to shoot Mason in the back. Taking to heart a lesson he learned from Hank, Mason had blocked the barrel of Burns's gun with cigarettes and it backfires on the man, killing him as Mason walks out into the dark.  
The Swan Princess
 King William ([[Dakin Matthews]]), widowed father of newborn Princess Odette, and Queen Uberta ([[Sandy Duncan]]), widowed mother of young Prince Derek, decide to betroth their children in the hopes of uniting their kingdoms. However, the evil sorcerer Rothbart ([[Jack Palance]]) is planning to take William's kingdom for himself by mastering a type of [[Black magic|dark magic]] known as The Forbidden Arts. Before he can strike, Rothbart is arrested by William's men. Despite calls for his death, King William spares Rothbart's life and banishes him. A hateful Rothbart swears to William that he will get his power back and take everything William owns and loves.  William and Uberta make Odette and Derek meet every summer, hoping they'll fall in love. When they meet for the first time, the royal children take an immediate dislike for each other, but as the years pass they gradually fall in love. But when Derek ([[Howard McGillin]]) only expresses love for Odette's ([[Michelle Nicastro]]) beauty, she and her father leave disappointed. On their journey home, they are ambushed by the vengeful Rothbart, who transforms into a "Great Animal" with his new powers, kidnapping Odette and fatally injuring William. Derek arrives on the scene and William tells him with his dying breath of a "Great Animal", and Odette is gone. After searching and finding no sign of Odette, the entire Kingdom assumes she's dead. Uberta encourages her son to find another princess, but Derek is determined to find Odette believing she still lives. He and his best friend Bromley ([[Joel McKinnon Miller]]) practice hunting every day in preparation to face the Great Animal.  Elsewhere, Rothbart is keeping Odette at his castle lair at Swan Lake. He has cast a powerful spell that turns Odette into a [[swan]] during the day. At night, she can become human temporarily if she is on the lake when the moonlight touches it. Every night, Rothbart asks Odette to marry him so he can rule William's kingdom legally, but she refuses, then the moonlight leaves the lake, and finally she turns back into a swan. During her captivity, she befriends a [[tortoise]] named Speed ([[Steven Wright]]), a French [[frog]] named Jean-Bob ([[John Cleese]]), who claims to be a prince, and an Irish [[puffin]] ([[Steve Vinovich]]).  Puffin and Odette (in her swan form) fly together to find Derek. By chance, they stumble upon Derek in the woods as he is searching for the Great Animal. Derek mistakes Odette for the Great Animal (having deduced that the creature is a [[shapeshifter]]), and tries to kill her. The ensuing chase leads Derek to Swan Lake, where he witnesses Odette's change from swan to human when the moon rises. The two share a loving reunion, and Odette tells Derek that the spell can only be broken by a vow of everlasting love. Derek invites Odette to his mother's ball the following night, hoping to declare to the world of his love for her. Derek leaves just as Rothbart arrives and doesn't know the enchanter heard the whole conversation. Rothbart tells Odette she will never make it to the ball, for there will be [[new moon|"no moon"]] on that night, much to her dismay and sorrow. Later, inside his castle, fearing that Derek's vow would ruin his plans, Rothbart decides to transform his hag sidekick, Bridget, such that she appears to be Odette, ensuring that if Derek made the vow to her as the wrong woman, Odette will die. On the night of the ball, Rothbart imprisons Odette (in swan form) in the dungeon of his castle, along with Bromley, whom he had found in the woods the other night. Bridget, in the form of human Odette, arrives at Uberta's ball where she is dancing with Derek, who is unaware of her true identity.  At Swan Lake, Puffin, Speed and Jean-Bob manage to free Odette from the dungeon through a duel with two hungry [[Alligator|alligators]] and she flies to Uberta's castle, but is too late. Derek makes the vow of everlasting love to the wrong girl and Rothbart bursts in, revealing to Derek the fake's true form, Bridget. Realizing his mistake, Derek races after Odette back to Swan Lake, where Odette transforms back into her human form. As Derek holds a dying Odette in his arms, she tells him she loves him before losing consciousness. A furious Derek confronts Rothbart, demanding him to undo the spell, but the sorcerer declares to the prince "Only if you defeat...me!". Rothbart transforms into the Great Animal, and a battle ensues with Rothbart overpowering Derek. Odette's animal friends return Derek's bow to him, and Bromley, who has also escaped the dungeon, provides Derek with a single arrow. Derek catches and fires the arrow into the Great Animal's heart, killing him.  A heart-broken Derek confesses his love to Odette, and she wakes up, having managed to survive long enough for the sorcerer's defeat; the spell on her is broken. Derek and Odette get married and move into Rothbart's former castle, where they live happily ever after.

Meanwhile a doctor who is a friend of Ravishankar convinces him to undergo [[Holistic health|holistic treatment]] at his centre. The centre is driven by a theme that each and every [[Cell (biology)|cell]] in our body has a mind which decides whether the body it belongs to should live or die. The treatment does wonders to Ravi and he is on his way to recovery and final checkups confirm that his [[blood count]] is normal. Ravi is delighted to come back to his life; but everything in his hope and joy of life is squandered when he learns that his recovery is a blow to all his relatives including his wife, who by now has started sleeping with Rajendran. He feels resentment again when he learns that his death was more awaited than his recovery.  Ravi finally commits suicide after his childhood sweetheart Durga also leaves him, and he reads his obituary in his office.  The final line to the audience is the old message that ''death is the ultimate truth, an inevitable part of life and is in its own way a moment to rejoice''.

The Taebaek Mountains
 The film originates from the great river story ''Taebaegsanmaek'' consisting of 10 volumes and is written by Cho Jeongrae. The story tries to describe and reveal a few generations-lasting conflicts between the haves (proprietors) and have-nots (peasants), which develop into right wings and left wings respectively. While revealing why and how the conflicts come about, the story depicts every corner of real life—romantic, shamanic, and Confucian aspects of the contemporaries. It provides a further insight into the politically controversial ideological issue on which the viewpoint is virtually hardened among over 40's in South Korea. This ideological issue survives even in the digital age to have a substantial effect on presidential elections. The author dares to show what the ideological conflict derives from and tries to describe it in detail and with artistic skill of commanding Korean colloquial language supplying its readers the true taste of Korean dialect expressions especially in its southern part Jeolla province.  
Take Care of Your Scarf, Tatiana
 Valto ([[Mato Valtonen]]) lives with his mother, who runs a clothing business. Valto is seen sewing clothes for his mother at the beginning of the film. When he discovers the coffee has run out, and his mother refuses to make him new one right away, he locks his mother in a cupboard, steals her money and goes out. Valto finds Reino ([[Matti Pellonpää]]), who has been fixing Valto’s car. They then go on a road trip with no apparent destination. With music coming out of a in-car vinyl player of Valto’s car and Reino’s story about how he got into some legal trouble after he punched someone, the two seemingly enjoy the road trip. This is a typical Kaurismäki’s ordinary-scene-made-interesting moment.   When they make a stop at a bar, they meet Tatiana ([[Kati Outinen]]) from [[Estonia]] and Klavdia ([[Kirsi Tykkyläinen]]) from [[Russia]]. Tatiana and Klavdia ask Valto and Reino to drive them to a harbor. Since Valto and Reino’s road trip does not have a clear destination at the first place, Valto and Reino agree to take Tatiana and Klavdia.   Throughout the journey, Valto has been drinking coffee and Reino drinking vodka. Although Reino is reserved in his nature, he sits down next to Tatiana during one of the stops of the journey. Tatiana relaxes her head on Reino’s shoulder. The film suggests the two have fallen in love at this point.   At the end of the film, Reino and Tatiana remain in love with each other and Valto returns home, releases his mother out of the cupboard and resumes sewing clothes.

Take Me Away (film)
   
Taxandria (film)
 Young prince Jan has been sent to a quiet coastal resort to study for his final exams, but instead he spends most of his time with his new friend, the lighthouse keeper. Jan ignores the warnings of the locals who claim that the loony lighthouse man ([[Armin Mueller-Stahl]]) eats seagulls for breakfast. Maybe the lighthouse keeper is crazy, but this does not prevent him from introducing prince Jan to the dreamland Taxandria, a phantasmagorical place devoid of time, memory, and progress. Jan learns that a reason for the lighthouse keeper's notoriety among the locals is that from time to time he hides political refugees from Taxandria from the authorities; in one scene, we see some of these fugitives arrive at the coast in a boat and taken in by the lighthouse keeper. It is however never made clear whether Taxandria really exists or if the viewer only sees what the lighthouse keeper relates to prince Jan, although once Jan is transported to Taxandria simply by looking into the lighthouse's rotating light while the keeper is away.  As a failed scientific experiment in the past accidentally removed Taxandria from its home planet (a disaster now recalled by the citizens of Taxandria as the ''Great [[wikt:cataclysm|Cataclysm]]''), all science, progress, and measure of time are outlawed as a consequence, whereas the ''Perennial Present'' reigns supreme. The land is ruled by two [[conjoined twin|conjoined]] princes, always hidden behind a curtain, and their police force who insure that everyone there lives in the Perennial Present, as it is illegal to discuss the past or future. The police is headed by this world's evil counterpart of the benevolent lighthouse keeper (a double role for actor Armin Mueller-Stahl), communicating the will and orders of the mute Two Princes, making him the effective ruler of Taxandria.  While at first Taxandria seems a magical, wonderful place, Jan soon sees the darker side of this strange world. The people are not happy living only in the present; it is repressive. Soon he sees that many suffer from extreme paranoia. Aimé (Elliott Spiers), the son of the evil Head of Police, seems to be a catalyst for change in Taxandria, as he is obsessed with making new inventions and learning about the country's past. Later, Aimé falls in love with Princess Ailée who is trying to free herself from the paradisaical confines of the Garden of Mirth, where women are kept away from men, and discovers the secret of his father that made him Taxandria's effective ruler while being the Head of Police, as well as the true nature of the Two Princes.

Zinovitz discovers that the ship's systems have been tampered with. A fight for power ensues and Becker, as a representative of the government, relieves Jammad from command. He is soon found dead in a malfunctioned virtual reality simulator.

The grounds for divorce are humiliating: Karol was unable to [[Consummation|consummate]] the marriage. Along with his wife, he loses his means of support (a [[beauty salon]] they jointly owned), his legal residency in France, and the rest of his cash in a series of mishaps, and is soon a beggar. He only retains a 2 [[French franc|franc]] coin.  In a [[Paris Métro]] station, performing songs for spare change, Karol meets and is befriended by another Pole, Mikołaj ([[Janusz Gajos]]). While Karol has lost his wife and his property, Mikołaj is married and successful; he offers Karol a job consisting of killing someone who wants to be dead but does not have enough courage to do it himself. Through a hazardous scheme, Mikołaj helps him return to Poland hidden in the suitcase shown at the beginning of the film, which is later stolen by employees at the airport. He returns to working as a [[hairdresser]] with his brother ([[Jerzy Stuhr]]).  Karol takes a job as a bodyguard in a seemingly innocent cash exchange office. Mikołaj meets Karol in a [[Warsaw Metro]] tunnel for the execution of the "suicide", it turns out to be that Mikołaj is the intended victim and asks Karol to kill him. Karol shoots a [[Blank (cartridge)|blank]] into Mikołaj's chest and asks him if he really wants to go through with it as the next bullet is real. Mikołaj refuses and is able to feel alive again. Using his position as a deceptively foolish bodyguard, Karol spies on his bosses and discovers their scheme to purchase different pieces of land that they knew were going to be targeted by big companies for development and [[Flipping|resell for large profits]]. Karol beats them to it, and then tells his ex-bosses that if they kill him all his [[Estate (law)|estate]] shall go to the [[Catholic Church|Church]], and they are therefore forced to purchase all the land from him.  With the money he gained from this scheme and with the payment from Mikołaj, the two go into business (of a vaguely defined but possibly illegal nature) together. Karol becomes ruthlessly ambitious, focusing his energies on money-making schemes while learning French and brooding over his wife's abandonment. He uses his new financial influence in a world where, as several characters observe, "you can buy anything" to execute a complex scheme to first win back Dominique, and then destroy her life by faking his own death after which she is imprisoned for his 'murder'. The final image of the film shows Karol staring at Dominique through the window of her prison cell, while crying, aware that he must finally let go of her.  
Threesome (film)
 Due to an administrative error two male college students, the shy and intellectual Eddy ([[Josh Charles]]) and the [[All-America]]n jock Stuart ([[Stephen Baldwin]]), end up with a female roommate. The university thought that Alex ([[Lara Flynn Boyle]]) was a man (based on her name) and thus the three students are forced to live with each other until the university can move Alex to a female residence hall.  Alex falls in love and tries unsuccessfully to seduce Eddy (who is [[gay]]); Eddy falls in love with Stuart; and Stuart is in love with Alex.  The trio become good friends and scare off anyone who tries to seduce the other.  Eventually, Alex, Stuart and Eddy agree to have an actual [[threesome]] that seems to destroy the friendship, and raises the possibility that Alex might have become pregnant.  After the threesome, they start to drift apart. Three weeks later the semester ends; Alex moves to an apartment, and Eddy gets a single dorm. Eddy (who acts as the film's narrator) eventually finds a boyfriend, Stuart finds happiness in a monogamous relationship with a woman, and Alex remains single. While they now only see each other for lunch occasionally, they do not seem to regret the friendship they had while in college.  
Thumbelina (1994 film)
 A lonely widow ([[Barbara Cook]]) is given a seed by a good witch. Once planted, the seed grows into a flower, and a tiny girl ([[Jodi Benson]]) emerges from inside the blossom, no bigger than the old woman's thumb. The old woman names the tiny girl [[Thumbelina]] and raises her as her own.  Although Thumbelina loves her mother, she craves companionship from someone her own size. One night, the fairy prince Cornelius ([[Gary Imhoff]]) stumbles upon Thumbelina after hearing her beautiful singing. The two take a ride on Cornelius' bumblebee, and fall in love; during this ride Mrs. Toad ([[Charo]]) and her son Grundel ([[Joe Lynch (actor)|Joe Lynch]]) are enchanted by Thumbelina's singing. Cornelius promises to return the next day, but that night, Mrs. Toad kidnaps Thumbelina from her bed and takes her away to her show boat, where she desires Thumbelina to join their troupe and marry Grundel, who is in love with her. They leave Thumbelina alone on a lily pad to fetch a priest; she is rescued by a friendly swallow, Jacquimo ([[Gino Conforti]]). Jacquimo's friends, the jitterbugs, promise to help Thumbelina get home safely while Jacquimo sets off to find Cornelius. Meanwhile, Cornelius learns of Thumbelina's kidnapping and ventures out to find her.  While trying to get home, Thumbelina is ambushed by Berkeley Beetle ([[Gilbert Gottfried]]), who scares the jitterbugs away. He too becomes enamored with her singing and promises to show her the way home if she sings at his Beetle Ball first. She reluctantly complies, but her bug disguise falls off during the concert and she is denounced as ugly. Beetle throws her out without helping her. Jacquimo appears and promises that he will find Cornelius and bring him to Thumbelina, but winter arrives and Jacquimo impales his wing on a thorn and is knocked out by the cold while Cornelius falls into a lake and ends up frozen in the ice. Thumbelina is later found by Miss Fieldmouse ([[Carol Channing]]) and taken to her underground home for shelter. She tells her of Cornelius' fate, leaving her devastated. She later meets Miss Fieldmouse's neighbor, Mr. Mole ([[John Hurt]]), who leads her to Jacquimo's body, though Thumbelina realizes he is alive. Mr. Mole expresses a desire to marry Thumbelina, and she reluctantly accepts after persuasion from Miss Fieldmouse. Jacquimo, however, recovers and leaves to find Cornelius, refusing to believe he is dead.   Grundel ventures out to find Thumbelina and finds Beetle, who he coerces into helping him by removing his wings to ensure his cooperation. Beetle finds Cornelius and brings him to Grundel, also informing him of Thumbelina's wedding to Mr. Mole. They head for Mr Mole's home to retrieve Thumbelina, while the jitterbugs find and thaw Cornelius' body out. At the wedding, Thumbelina finds herself unable to marry Mr. Mole. Grundel and Beetle appear and a chase ensues. Cornelius appears and confronts Grundel; the ensuing fight sends them both falling into an abyss. Thumbelina escapes and is reunited with Jacquimo, who takes her to Cornelius' kingdom, the Vale of the Fairies, and has her sing in order to lure Cornelius out. He appears, having survived the fall, and proposes to her; Thumbelina accepts and magically grows her own pair of wings.  With Jacquimo, Thumbelina's mother and the fairy court in attendance, Thumbelina and Cornelius are married and depart on Cornelius' bumblebee. Images shown during the credits reveal that Beetle resumed his singing career and grew new wings; Miss Fieldmouse married Mr. Mole; Grundel survived the fall with minor injuries and fell in love with a female toad; and Mrs. Rabbit and Mr. Fox settled their differences and found friendship.  
Through the Olive Trees
 Hossein Rezai plays a local stonemason-turned-actor. Outside the set of a film in which he is acting, he makes a marriage proposal to his leading lady, a student named Tahereh, who was orphaned by [[1990 Manjil–Rudbar earthquake|an earthquake]]. Because he is poor and illiterate, the girl's family finds his offer insulting; the girl avoids him as a result. She continues evading him even when they are filming, as she seems to have trouble grasping the difference between her role in the film and her real-life self. The fictional couple takes part in what would be the filming of ''Life, and Nothing More....''  The situation complicates further as Hossein still pursues the affections of the young actress while the film goes on. The director learns about this and tries to advise Hossein about what to do. He then illustrates their story and where the conflict began. The girl manages to finish the scene while Hossein woos her and then departs by walking as Hossein runs to follow her.  In the final scene, at a great distance, the girl finally gives an answer to Hossein and we are left with him running through a green field and back into the olive grove. The audience is left to wonder what response was given by the girl.  
Three Sisters (1994 film)
 In a small Russian town at the turn of the century, three sisters (Olga, Irina, and Masha) and their brother Andrei live but dream daily of their return to their former home in [[Moscow]], where life is charming and stimulating meaningful. But for now they exist in a malaise of dissatisfaction. Soldiers from the local military post provide them some companionship and society, but nothing can suffice to replace Moscow in their hopes. Andrei marries a provincial girl, Natasha, and begins to settle into a life of much less meaning than he had hoped. Natasha begins to run the family her way. Masha, though married, yearns for the sophisticated life and begins a dalliance with Vershinin, an army officer with a sick and suicidal wife. Even Irina, the freshest, most optimistic of the sisters, begins to waver in her dreams until, finally, tragedy strikes.  
Three Colours: Red
 Valentine Dussault(Irene Jacob) studies at University of Geneva and works as a part time model. She regularly attends ballet classes. She calls her possessive boyfriend in London and plans to meet him. During her part-time job as a model she poses for a [[chewing-gum]] campaign and the photo selected is one of her looking very sad. While walking back home, Auguste ([[Jean-Pierre Lorit]]), a student neighbour of Valentine's, drops his textbooks and one book falls open at a particular chapter of the Criminal Code, which he notes. Driving back to her apartment, Valentine is distracted and accidentally hits a German Shepherd dog. She tracks down the owner, a retired judge, Joseph Kern ([[Jean-Louis Trintignant]]). He seems unconcerned. Valentine takes the dog, Rita, to a veterinarian, where she learns that the dog is pregnant. Later, money is delivered to her apartment from an unnamed sender. She overcomes the sexual advances made by the ad company's photographer.  Out for a walk the next day, Rita leads Valentine back to Kern's house. He says she should keep the dog after confirming that he sent the money for the expenses. She returns the extra amount to Kern after meeting the vet's expenses. Valentine hears that Kern is eavesdropping on a male neighbour's sexual telephone conversation with his male lover. She tries to convey to him about respecting the privacy of his neighbour. The judge challenges Valentine to reveal the eavesdropping to the neighbour. She goes to do so but is horrified to see the man's young daughter on the telephone extension, listening to the same conversation. Upon her return, Kern tells her that their actions of telling / not telling and spying / not spying make no difference to the eventual outcome of other people's lives. As the conversation goes on Valentine tells that her brother is fathered by someone else other than her biological father. Before leaving, Valentine also hears a conversation between Auguste and his girlfriend, Karin (Frederique Feder) neither of whom she has met. Auguste passes his exam to become a judge and credits his success to the dropped textbook.  That evening, Kern writes a series of letters to his neighbours and the court confessing his spying activities, and the community files a [[class action]]. Later, at the law courts, Kern sees Karin flirting with another man. When Valentine confronts Kern, he says it was her feeling of disgust that prompted him to confess. They discuss the nature of [[altruism]] and Valentine asks if he has ever loved or been loved. Kern evades the question and instead recounts a case in which he mistakenly acquitted a sailor, only to see him live a life free of crime.  Auguste has been unable to reach Karin by telephone since his graduation so he drives to her flat and climbs up the building. Through the window, he sees her having sex with another man and leaves, distraught. He takes his grief out on his dog and at one stage abandons him at a lamppost. On Karin's personalised weather information service she is predicting that the weather around the UK will be perfect. She is happy about this as she is about to sail there herself soon (with her new boyfriend who owns a yacht).  The day before Valentine leaves for England, she invites Kern to her fashion show. Stormy weather is gathering and Kern seems to sense that Valentine will soon be in danger from it. After the show their conversation turns again to Kern's doomed love life. His answer betrays echoes of Auguste's recent life, including the infidelity and the dropped textbook. He says that the girl he loved died in an accident after he followed her across the [[English Channel]]. He also says that his last case as a judge pitted him against his ex-girlfriend's lover. By co-incidence, Auguste's first case as a judge is Kern's trial. Kern tells Valentine in more detail about a dream he had about her. In the dream, she is 50 years old and happy and with a man she loves. As they say goodbye, Kern and Valentine plan to meet again in three weeks' time when Kern will give her one of Rita's puppies.  Finally, Valentine boards the [[ferry]] to England. We also see Auguste on the ferry, reunited with his dog. Kern is choosing the puppy he will give to Valentine on her return when he hears disastrous news; the storm has hit the English Channel and both the ferry and the yacht have sunk. Kern fears the worst, only seven survivors are pulled from the ferry. We see 6 of them in freeze-frame: Julie and Olivier from ''[[Three Colors: Blue|Blue]]'', Karol and Dominique from ''[[Three Colors: White|White]]'', Auguste (without his dog) and finally Valentine. Auguste and Valentine are looking into each other's eyes, inviting the viewer to believe this is the man from Kern's dream, who she will find happiness with. The final image replicates the iconic ad poster of Valentine, but this time with real emotion showing on her face.  
The Three Swordsmen

It was found out that Ku framed Siu Sam-siu to help Ming-kim, whom she has been admiring, win the title of the world's greatest. After her plot was revealed, Ku captures Siu Sam-siu's lover, Butterfly, and forces him to battle with Ming-kim and she later helplessly suicides.

Time Chasers
 Physics teacher and amateur pilot Nick Miller (Matthew Bruch) has finally completed his quest of enabling time travel, via a [[Commodore 64]] and his small [[Citabria|airplane]].  After being inspired by a television commercial for GenCorp, he uses a ruse to bring out both a GenCorp executive and a reporter from a local paper.  To Nick's surprise, the reporter is Lisa Hansen (Bonnie Pritchard), an old high school flame.  One trip to 2041 later and Gencorp's executive, Matthew Paul (Peter Harrington), quickly arranges Nick a meeting with CEO J.K. Robertson ([[George Woodard]]).  Impressed by the potential of time travel, Robertson offers Nick a licensing agreement on the technology.  The following week, Nick and Lisa meet at the [[supermarket]] and go on a date to the 1950s.  However, another trip to 2041 reveals that GenCorp abused Nick's time travel technology, creating a [[dystopian]] future. In an attempt to tell J.K. about how GenCorp inadvertently ruined the future. J.K. dismisses the eventuality, and states that there's enough time to worry about how to fix it before it happens. J.K. sees Nick as a threat to GenCorp, and due to the association with the U.S. Government, considers Nick's actions as treason. Nick and Lisa escape GenCorp and spend the remainder of the film trying to reverse the damage to the future. When J.K. finds out about this, he and Matt try to shoot down Nick's plane, killing Lisa in the process while Nick jumps out before the plane crashes. This ultimately culminates in a [[Battle_of_Hubbardton|fight in 1777]] during the [[American Revolution]], the deaths of the present Nick and Robertson, and the destruction of the time machine before the original demo, thus ensuring that the majority of the film's events never happen in the first place.  The film ends with the now current Nick (now aware of the danger of his time machine) sabotaging his demonstration, and doing a pitch of how an elderly skydiver would be a better ad campaign for J.K.'s company. Furious about being misled, J.K. fires Matt. Nick deletes the eight 5¼" floppy disks that make time travel possible. At the end of the film, Nick talks to Lisa in the supermarket as he did in the previous timeline.  
Timecop
 By the year 1994, time travel has been developed and is used for illicit purposes. The Time Enforcement Commission (TEC) has been established to police the use of time travel, with [[United States Senate|Senator]] Aaron McComb overseeing operations and financing. Police officer Max Walker has been offered a position with the TEC but is unsure whether or not to accept. While at home with his wife Melissa, he is attacked by unknown assailants and witnesses the house explode, killing her.  Ten years later, Walker is a veteran of the TEC working under Commissioner Eugene Matuzak, who sends him back to October 1929 to prevent his former partner, Lyle Atwood, from using knowledge of the future to financially benefit from the U.S. [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash]]. When confronted, Atwood admits to be working for Senator McComb, who needs the funds for his upcoming presidential campaign. Fearing that McComb will erase him from history, Atwood attempts to jump to his death, but Walker catches him mid-leap and returns to 2004. Refusing to testify, Atwood is sentenced to execution and is returned to 1929 where he resumes falling to his death.  Walker is assigned a new partner, TEC rookie Sarah Fielding, and together they are sent back to 1994 to investigate McComb. They witness a meeting between young McComb and his business partner Jack Parker, where McComb wishes to withdraw over a disagreement about a new computer chip. They are interrupted by the older McComb, who arrives from 2004 to stop the exchange claiming the chip will become highly profitable. Older McComb specifically tells his younger self not to touch him as the same matter cannot occupy the same space, and then kills Parker. Fielding turns on Walker, revealing that she works for McComb, and after a shootout with McComb's henchmen, Fielding is wounded and Walker escapes back to 2004.  Walker returns to the TEC to find the future altered. McComb is now sole owner of the computer company and is a presidential front runner while the TEC is being shut down due to budget cuts. Walker appeals to Matuzak, who has no knowledge of the alternate present. Matuzak sends Walker back to the past in a prototype time machine, sacrificing himself in the process.  Back in 1994, Walker finds Fielding in the hospital and after interrogation she agrees to testify against McComb, though she is murdered in her room shortly thereafter. While at the hospital, Walker finds a record of a recent visit by his wife Melissa, discovering that she was pregnant. Realizing that she would be killed later that night, he tracks her down and reveals himself to be from the future. Walker tells his wife he knows she has something to tell his past self and no matter what happens that night to keep him in the house.  That night, the younger Walker returns home and is told by Melissa that she is pregnant. However, the younger Walker is attacked just as before, with the assailants revealed to be in McComb's employ, but is unknowingly aided by his older self who has been lying in wait. With the assailants defeated, the older McComb steps in and takes Melissa hostage, confronting the older Walker with the bomb. McComb reveals that he sent the assassins back to kill the younger Walker, and even though he will die in the ensuing explosion, his younger self will survive and become [[President of the United States|President]] with Walker gone. Walker, however, reveals that he had previously lured the younger McComb to the house, who enters the room. After McComb wounds Melissa, Walker pushes the two McCombs together and, as the same matter cannot occupy the same space, they merge into a screaming, writhing liquefied mass before disappearing from existence forever. Walker escapes with Melissa before the bomb explodes and lays her down beside his unconscious younger self before returning to the future.  Back in 2004, Walker finds the timeline has changed for the better. Matuzak and Fielding are alive and active in the TEC, whereas McComb no longer exists. Walker returns home to find Melissa alive and waiting for him with their young son.

To Live (1994 film)
 In the 1940s, Xu Fugui ([[Ge You]]) is a rich man's son and compulsive gambler, who loses his family property to a man named Long'er. His behaviour also causes his long-suffering wife Jiazhen ([[Gong Li]]) to leave him, along with their daughter, Fengxia and their unborn son, Youqing.  Fugui eventually reunites with his wife and children, but is forced to start a [[shadow play|shadow puppet]] troupe with a partner named Chunsheng. The [[Chinese Civil War]] is occurring at the time, and both Fugui and Chunsheng are conscripted into the [[Kuomintang]] during a performance. Midway through the war, the two are captured by the revolutionary army and serve by performing their shadow puppet routine for the revolutionaries. Eventually Fugui is able to return home, only to find out that due to a week-long fever, Fengxia has become mute and partially deaf.  Soon after his return, Fugui learns that Long'er did not want to donate any of his wealth to the "people's government", and so Long'er decided to burn all of his property. No one helps put out the fire because Long'er was a gentry. He is eventually put on trial and is sentenced to execution. As Long'er is pulled away, he recognizes Fugui in the crowd, and tries to talk to him as he is dragged towards the execution grounds. Fugui is filled with fear and runs into an alleyway before hearing five gunshots. He runs home to tell Jiazhen what has happened, and they quickly pull out the certificate stating that Fugui served in the revolutionary army. Fugui assures his wife that they are no longer gentries and will not be killed.  The story moves forward a decade into the future, to the time of the [[Great Leap Forward]]. The local town chief enlists everyone to donate all scrap iron to the national drive to [[Backyard furnace|produce steel]] and make weaponry for retaking [[Taiwan]]. As an entertainer, Fugui performs for the entire town nightly, and is very smug about his singing abilities.  Soon after, some boys begin picking on Fengxia. Youqing decides to get back at one of the boys by dumping spicy noodles on his head during a communal lunch. Fugui is furious, but Jiazhen stops him and tells him why Youqing acted the way he did. Fugui realizes the love his children have for each other.  The children are exhausted from the hard labor they are doing in the town and try to sleep whenever they can. They eventually get a break during the festivities for meeting the scrap metal quota. The entire village eats dumplings in celebration. In the midst of the family eating, schoolmates of Youqing call for him to come prepare for the District Chief. Jiazhen tries to make Fugui let him sleep but eventually relents and packs her son twenty dumplings for lunch. Fugui carries his son to the school, and tells him to heat the dumplings before eating them, as he will get sick if he eats cold dumplings. He must listen to his father to have a good life.  Later on in the day, the older men and students rush to tell Fugui that his son has been killed by the District Chief. He was sleeping on the other side of a wall that the Chief's Jeep was on, and the car ran into the wall, injuring the Chief and crushing Youqing. Jiazhen, in hysterics, is forbidden to see her son's dead body, and Fugui screams at his son to wake up. Fengxia is silent in the background.  The District Chief visits the family at the grave, only to be revealed as Chunsheng. His attempts to apologize and compensate the family are rejected, particularly by Jiazhen, who tells him he owes her family a life. He returns to his Jeep in a haze, only to see his guard beating Fengxia for breaking the Jeep's windows. He tells him to stop, and walks home.  The story moves forward again another decade, to the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The village chief advises Fugui's family to burn their puppet drama props, which have been deemed as counter-revolutionary. Fengxia carries out the act, and is oblivious to the Chief's real reason for coming: to discuss a suitor for her. Fengxia is now grown up and her family arranges for her to meet Wan Erxi, a local leader of the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]]. Erxi, a man crippled by a workplace accident, fixes her parent's roof and paints depictions of [[Mao Zedong]] on their walls with his workmates. He proves to be a kind, gentle man; he and Fengxia fall in love and marry, and she soon becomes pregnant.  Chunsheng, still in the government, visits immediately after the wedding to ask for Jiazhen's forgiveness, but she refuses to acknowledge him. Later, he is branded a reactionary and a capitalist. He comes to tell them his wife has committed suicide and he intends to as well. He has come to give them all his money. Jiazhen refuses to take it. However, as Chunsheng leaves, Jiazhen commands him to live, reminding him that he still owes them a life.  Months later, during Fengxia's childbirth, her parents and husband accompany her to the county hospital. All doctors have been sent to do hard labor for being over educated, and the students are left as the only ones in charge. Wan Erxi manages to find a doctor to oversee the birth, removing him from confinement, but he is very weak from starvation. Fugui purchases seven steamed buns (mantou) for him and the family decides to name the son Mantou, after the buns. However, Fengxia begins to hemorrhage, and the nurses panic, admitting that they do not know what to do. The family and nurses seek the advice of the doctor, but find that he has overeaten and is semiconscious. The family is helpless, and Fengxia dies from [[hypovolemia]] (blood loss). The point is made that the doctor ate 7 buns, but that by drinking too much water at the same time, each bun expanded to the size of 7 buns: therefore Fengxia's death is a result of the doctor's having the equivalent of 49 buns in his belly.  The movie ends six years later, with the family now consisting of Fugui, Jiazhen, their son-in-law Erxi, and grandson Mantou. The family visits the graves of Youqing and Fengxia, where Jiazhen, as per tradition, leaves dumplings for her son. Erxi buys a box full of young chicks for his son, which they decide to keep in the chest formerly used for the shadow puppet props. When Mantou inquires how long it will take for the chicks to grow up, Fugui's response is a more tempered version of something he said earlier in the film. However, in spite of all of his personal hardships, he expresses optimism for his grandson's future, and the film ends with his statement, "and life will get better and better" as the whole family sits down to eat.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110081/synopsis</ref> Although the ending has been criticized as sentimental, the resignation and forced good cheer of Fugui and especially Jiazhen belie a happy ending.<ref></ref>

Trading Mom
 Elizabeth, Jeremy, and Harry Martin are three children who have had up to here with their nagging mother...a widowed strict workaholic who rarely spends quality time with, or even speaks to, them - except to criticize or scold them ever since their father had passed away. Following a disastrous last day of school (Principal Leeby finds Elizabeth holding - but not smoking - a friend's cigarette; he then busts Jeremy for defending Harry against Ricky Turner, the class bully, who gets off scott-free; he also busts Harry, who hasn't done anything wrong, and even schedules a home visit), they are unfairly grounded for the entire summer vacation with no camp, allowance, TV, or anything by their infuriated mother. Then they meet Mrs. Cavour, a mysterious woman who works as a gardener. She tells them of an ancient spell which will make their mother disappear...along with all their memories of her.  That evening, the kids recite the incantation...which indeed works overnight. The next morning, however, Principal Leeby shows up at their house. He demands that Mrs. Martin come in for a chat regarding the trouble at school yesterday. When the kids (for obvious reasons) can't explain what has happened to her instead making up a story that she had left early for an emergency, he becomes suspicious and contacts social worker Dr. Richardson - who threatens to put them in separate foster homes unless their mother is located. So Mrs. Cavour tells them of a place in town called the Mommy Market, where practically any breed of mother imaginable can be found. Their policy, however, is that every customer (or party of customers) receives three tokens...each of which is good for taking home one mother at a time. If said customer does not find a suitable mother before running out of tokens, that customer can never return again. The kids select (in order): a wealthy-but-snappish French woman; an attentive-but-monotonous nature-hiker; and a fun-but-wild circus performer. Each set various standards, which the kids can't possibly live up to. Suddenly, they recognize their mother...who herself has been made available at the Mommy Market.  When the kids rush in and beg her to come home, chaos ensues and they are ejected from there forever. As Principal Leeby had called the police to put them in three separate foster homes since he is unable to contact their mother, they seek out Mrs. Cavour, who explains that the spell can be broken and their mother will return - but only if they ''collectively'' recall something about her. They do so and happily bring her breakfast in bed. She tries to remember why she grounded them yesterday, but can't. She then tells them that Principal Leeby is coming over to visit. They are now ready to dismiss everything which happened as a bizarre dream. Outside, Principal Leeby drops by to speak with Mrs. Martin about the problems the kids (supposedly) caused at school. He is snared by an animal trap which the nature-hiker showed Elizabeth how to make.

Trapped in Paradise
  At [[Christmas]] time, [[New York City|New York]] restaurant manager Bill Firpo's ([[Nicolas Cage]]) brothers Dave ([[Jon Lovitz]]) and Alvin ([[Dana Carvey]]) are paroled early and placed in Bill's custody. Dave and Alvin ask Bill to take them to [[Paradise, Pennsylvania]] to do a favor for a fellow inmate of theirs. Bill refuses as his brothers are not allowed out of the state and he knows Dave's pathological tendencies. He only agrees after getting linked to a robbery his brothers committed.  When they discover Paradise's bank is light on security, Bill feels the urge to rob it if he had a gun. Fortunately, there are guns in the car Dave and Alvin borrowed. With Alvin driving a stolen car, Bill and Dave storm the bank in ski-masks. The bank president's wife ([[Angela Paton]]) tells them that the bank safe door is locked and the president, Mr. Clifford Anderson ([[Donald Moffat]]), is on lunch. While Dave stays in the bank, Alvin and Bill charge into the restaurant, taking Mr. Anderson and the restaurant patrons back to the bank. Bill and Dave gain access to the vault and soon rush out of the bank with $275,000, with Alvin driving the getaway car.  While trying to get out of town, Alvin gets them lost. A police car turns on the sirens and they try to evade getting caught. Because of slick roads, they drive over a bridge. The police officer does not see them crash and drives past the bridge, but another car stops and offers them a ride. Due to the interstates being closed, the man takes them to his relatives. Upon arriving at the house, they find out it is the house of the bank president Mr. Anderson. However, the relatives don't recognize them.  Vic Mazzucci (Vic Manni), the inmate who gave Dave and Alvin the tip about the low security of the bank, gets enraged that they robbed the bank and busts out of jail. He and his henchman, Caesar, take the Firpoes' mother, Edna ([[Florence Stanley]]) [[hostage]], and threatens to kill her unless they give him the stolen money.  Bill gets bus tickets, and while getting out, the FBI asks him to open the bag he is carrying with him, which contains all of the money. The bag is grabbed by Ed Dawson ([[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]]) and Clovis Minor (John Bergantine), two inept shopkeepers, made "deputies" by the local police chief. Bill tricks the FBI by shooting rounds from Ed's gun in the ground making the crowd run around and gets away with his bag. However, they miss their bus. They then try to get away via canoe. The canoe is headed towards a waterfall and Alvin falls into the water. A nearby family pulls Alvin out of water and saves him with [[CPR]].  Alvin then steals a horse carriage from the police chief's son, Timmy. The feds chase the carriage, but after they drive into the forest the police cars are unable to continue the chase. They ditch the horse carriage and decide to hitchhike. However, the horse, Merlin, and the carriage get pulled into the water, causing the brothers to save him and go to a [[truck stop]] instead. There, Bill and Alvin decide to return the money to the bank while Dave refuses, knowing that their mother would be killed if they do so (Bill and Alvin are unaware of this). Alvin then reveals to Bill he is not wanted in New York and that they scammed him. Upset, Bill leaves his two brothers, then heads off to return the money and asks strangers for a ride to Paradise. By coincidence, he winds up getting a ride with Vic and Caesar, who are holding his mother hostage in the trunk. Bill shows them his mother's picture, whereupon Vic tries to shoot him so he can get the money Bill has in the bag. Bill jumps out of the car and escapes, rescued by Dave, Alvin and Merlin.  They try to get the money back into the bank but trigger the alarm. They then give the money to a church with a letter requesting to return it to the town's people. Trying to get away, Ed and Clovis (who had sold the Firpoes the ski masks before the robbery) recognize them and want the money for themselves. Ed and Clovis grab the brothers and take them to the Anderson house, while followed by the police. Vic and Caesar are holding the Andersons hostage, along with Timmy, Edna and Sarah ([[Mädchen Amick]]), Vic's daughter and a tenant of the family. Upon entering, Ed gets knocked out, while Clovis and the Firpoes are also taken hostage.  The police see the license plates on the car in front of the Anderson house are from a stolen car, and therefore order Vic and Caesar to come out with their hands held up. While the inmates are busy figuring out what to do, they get attacked by Timmy, who immobilizes Caesar and shoots Vic. The police rush into the house and take everyone to the office. There, FBI agent Shaddus Peyser ([[Richard Jenkins]]) tries to figure out what happened, and because the town's people hide what they know about Bill, Alvin, and Dave and the church pastor returns the money to the police, they release them. Bill stays in Paradise to be with Sarah, while Alvin and Dave return with their mother to New York.

Under the Domim Tree
 The film follows the lives and struggles of several teenagers, focusing on Aviya, an Israeli [[Sabra (person)|sabra]] whose father was killed in 1939 in Israel and whose mother suffers from mental illness. The youths, most Holocaust survivors and all orphans, live in a communal farming village.  In the opening scene, set in the winter of 1953, a large group of adults and teenagers are shown searching for Misha, a young boy from the boarding house. He is eventually found drowned in a river. It quickly becomes apparent that he, along with Yurek and Ze'evik, had regularly run through the woods at night, a result of having hidden in the forest for two years during the Holocaust. Yurek and Ze'evik cease this behavior temporarily, to the relief of the headmasters and their peers, before resuming it several months later.  A new girl, Miriam "Mira" Segal, arrives at the boarding house in spring. She proves uncooperative with the living arrangements and is openly hostile at times, drawing ire from the other girls.  Aviya still hopes that her mother, Henya, who has been institutionalized for years, will recover and regularly visits the hospital where Henya lives. Henya believed she had been in Europe during the Holocaust even though she and her husband had left prior to the war. She later becomes romantically involved with Yurek, whose behavior she is concerned for but does not question. Both, along with Ze'evik, frequently take comfort in sitting under the domim (crab apple) tree near the boarding house.  Their lives seem to improve over the next few weeks, with a plan being made for the youths to plant hundreds of tulip bulbs around the domim tree and Yola, another girl at the home, finding out that her father is still alive in Warsaw. The entire community rejoices for Yola, with several girls helping her prepare for the trip to Poland and other children requesting that she deliver letters to relatives they believe may still be alive while there. However, tragedy strikes and Yola's father dies suddenly before she can see him.  Aviya receives a letter from an aunt containing a photograph of her father and the name of a cemetery. As a result, she is able to find and visit her father's grave in Haifa.  Shortly afterwards, Ariel, the headmaster, succumbs to pressure from a psychologist to separate Yurek and Ze'evik in order to avoid a repeat of what happened to Misha. In response, they hide in the woods before appearing again a few days later, saying, "We stay together or we die." Ariel quickly agrees to that they will not be separated.  Weeks later, a couple arrives at the youth village claiming to be Mira's parents. Despite having no memory of her family before they were killed in the Holocaust, she adamantly denies the allegation and tells the other girls that the man and woman had found her at an orphanage in Italy after the war and told her that they were her parents. She moved to Israel with them and eventually ran away after the man became physically and emotionally abusive.  The case is taken to court, and the rest of the youth immediately put aside past frustrations and give Mira their undivided support. Through this turn of events, Mira is able to remember her mother's face, disproving the couple's claims, and, because of the kindness shown by the other children, learns to trust again.

The Voyeur (1994 film)
 In Rome, Dodo is a university lecturer taking a class in French literature. Also in the apartment is his bedridden father Alberto, whose nurse Fausta looks after his medical and sexual needs. The withdrawn Dodo does not respond to her provocative behaviour and is repelled by the rampant sexuality of his father. Part of his trouble is that he was too close to his now dead mother, who not only had to meet her husband's needs but also had to share him with countless other women. But his main problem is that his beautiful and sexy wife Silvia, who breezed into his quiet studious life, has vanished with another man.   After a class, an African girl called Pascasie asks him back to her flat and strips off, inviting him to photograph her. When her flatmate comes home, after an initial spat over the presence of a strange man, the two girls start making love. Dodo, always the observer and not the participant, leaves them to it. Increasingly, he fantasises about the absent Silvia and about the sex lives of his parents. One night there is a mystery woman in his father's bedroom and in the morning Fausta says it must have been Silvia, because she still has a door key. Then, all of a sudden, Silvia says she wants to come back to the apartment.

Wes Craven's New Nightmare
 Heather Langenkamp lives in [[Los Angeles]], California, with her husband Chase and their young son Dylan. She has become popular thanks to her role as [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]] from the [[Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''Nightmare on Elm Street'' film series]]. One night she has a nightmare that her family is attacked by a set of animated Krueger claws from an upcoming ''Nightmare'' film, where two workers are brutally murdered on set. Waking up to an earthquake, she spies a cut on Chase's finger exactly like the one he had received in her dream, but she quickly dismisses the notion it was caused by the claws.  Heather receives a call from an obsessed fan who quotes [[Freddy Krueger]]'s nursery rhyme in an eerie, Freddy-like voice. This coincides with a meeting she has with [[New Line Cinema]] where she is pitched the idea to reprise her role as Nancy in a new ''Nightmare'' film which, unbeknownst to her, Chase has been working on. When she returns home, she sees Dylan watching her original film. When she interrupts him, he has a severely traumatizing episode where he screams at her. The frequent calls, and Dylan's strange behavior, cause her to call Chase. He agrees to rush home from his workplace as the two men from the opening dream did not report in for work. But Chase falls asleep while driving and is slashed by Freddy's claw and dies. His death seems to affect Dylan even further, which causes concern for Heather's long-time friend and former costar [[John Saxon]]. He suggests she seek medical attention for Dylan and herself after she has a nightmare at Chase's funeral in which Freddy tries to take Dylan away.  Dylan's health continues to deteriorate. He becomes increasingly paranoid about going to sleep, and fears Freddy Krueger, even though Heather has never shown Dylan her films. She visits [[Wes Craven]], who suggests that Freddy is a supernatural entity drawn to his films, freed after the film series ended with the release of ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]].'' It now focuses on Heather, as Nancy,  its primary foe. [[Robert Englund]] also has a strange knowledge of it, describing the new Freddy to Heather, then disappearing from all contact shortly after. Following another earthquake, Heather takes a traumatized Dylan to the hospital, where Dr. Heffner, suspecting abuse, suggests he remain under observation. Heather returns home for Dylan's stuffed dinosaur while his babysitter Julie tries unsuccessfully to keep the nurses from sedating the sleep-deprived boy. Dylan falls asleep from the sedative. Freddy brutally kills Julie in Dylan's dream. Capable of [[sleepwalking]], Dylan leaves the hospital of his own accord while Heather chases him home across the interstate as Freddy taunts him and dangles him before traffic. On returning home, Heather realizes that John Saxon has established his persona as [[Donald Thompson (film character)|Don Thompson]]. When Heather embraces Nancy's role, Freddy emerges completely into reality and takes Dylan to his world. Heather finds a trail of Dylan's sleeping pills and follows him to a dark underworld. Freddy fights off Heather and chases Dylan into an oven. Dylan escapes the oven, doubles back to Heather, and together they push Freddy into the oven and light it. This destroys both the monster and his reality.  Dylan and Heather emerge from under his blankets, and Heather finds a copy of the film's events in a [[screenplay]] at the foot of the bed. Inside is written thanks from Wes for defeating Freddy and playing Nancy one last time. Her victory helps to imprison the entity of the film franchise's fictitious world once more. Dylan asks if it is a story, and Heather agrees that it is before opening the script and reading from its pages to her son.  
When a Man Loves a Woman (film)

[[Meg Ryan]] plays Alice Green, a school counselor who has a serious drinking problem and is married to Michael ([[Andy García]]), an airline pilot. Though she's lighthearted and loving, Alice is often reckless and, when drunk, even neglects her children: nine-year-old daughter Jess ([[Tina Majorino]]) from a previous marriage, and four-year-old daughter Casey ([[Mae Whitman]]), whose father is Michael.  One afternoon, Alice enters their home in a drunken incoherent state. She dismisses the reluctant caretaker, who leaves her alone with her children. Still drinking, Alice is confronted by her elder daughter concerned for her mother's welfare.  In return, she violently slaps Jess, who runs to her room crying.  Alice enters the shower. Unable to control her balance and calling for Jess, she falls to the side and smashes through the shower door onto the bathroom floor. Fearing her mother has died, Jess contacts Michael who immediately flies home to be by his wife's side.  After the incident and while in the hospital, Michael and Alice confront the truth about Alice's drinking. They jointly decide she must seek professional help for her alcoholism. Upon release from the hospital, a timid Alice enters a rehabilitation clinic.  Michael finds himself now the main caretaker of their home and two children, a role he struggles to maintain along with his career as an airline pilot. Meanwhile, at the clinic, Alice is flourishing; her recovery is painful but stabilizing and she is well liked and respected by both staff and fellow clinic tenants alike. During a family visit day at the clinic, Alice immediately begins to rebuild her shattered bond with the children leaving Michael alone to wander the grounds uncomfortable and out of place in his wife's new lifestyle.  Alice returns home sober yet guarded. She is vocal, strong and changed. Michael is having trouble adjusting to Alice's balance. He has become used to being the stable and controlled one in their relationship and is jealous of Alice's lack of dependence and outside friendships. Coming to terms with their estrangement, a reluctant Michael (believing therapy is for the weak) and a willing Alice see a marriage counselor who quickly establishes Michael's "co-dependency" on Alice's role as an alcoholic.  Unable to find a medium and with tempers flared, Michael moves out and Alice becomes the main caretaker of their home and children. Alice is once again seen flourishing in her new role while Michael is unable to find control and seeks out a support group for spouses of alcoholics. Initially shy, Michael becomes a more vocal member of the group and shares his sorrow over his lack of understanding for the gravity his wife's sobriety would have on him, his children and his marriage.  Alice and Michael singularly return to the hospital to celebrate the birth of their caretaker's baby. They spend time together and as they depart Alice asks Michael if he would attend her 180-day sober speech where she will acknowledge her failings and accomplishments. She also tells him that she has been thinking about asking him to come home with her. Michael tells Alice he has been offered a job in Denver. For the first time since they both agreed Alice should enter rehab, they both agree Michael should take the position.   The penultimate scene is Alice as she stands on a stage and tells her sobriety story; the toll it took on her, her children and her marriage. She is funny, confident, sad but optimistic. Her audience is moved to tears. Her speech ends and she is surrounded by well wishers. Out of the crowd appears Michael. At ease with himself and Alice, he explains what he missed along the way..."to listen, to really listen."  They share an intense, longing, passionate kiss as the credits roll.  
The War (1994 film)
 Stephen, a [[PTSD|shell-shocked]] [[Vietnam War|Vietnam veteran]], returns from a mental hospital, which he entered voluntarily because he was suffering from nightmares about the war and had in consequence lost three jobs in a row. After having been treated and finally coming home again, he gets a new job as custodial engineer at a grammar school, but loses it again within less than one week because of a law forbidding people who spent time in a mental hospital to work within the vicinity of children. However, the Simmons family desperately needs money, so Stephen continues looking for work, and finds a job picking potatoes. There he makes friends with a man called Moe Henry, with whose help he succeeds in obtaining a job working in a mine - his best one yet.  In the meantime, the twins Lidia and Stu try to get away from the dreary reality of their lives. They find a tree in a forest close to their house and decide to build a tree house there. At first they and their friends argue over who has to construct it and who is allowed to use it; the three boys - Stu, Chet and Marsh - want it all to themselves, while the girls - Lidia, Elvadine and Amber - want them to work on it and share it afterwards. After several deals, they agree to build the tree house together. The girls get everything they need from the garbage heap belonging to the Lipnickis, a neighboring family with a reputation for bullying, who have a grudge against the Simmons and their friends. Unfortunately Billy, the youngest of the Lipnicki kids, discovers Lidia, Elvadine and Amber on his father's territory, so the girls have to pay him to keep quiet, but later after he falls under a candy coma his brothers force him to betray Lidia's secret.  While the children are busy building their tree house, Stephen and Moe are caught in a collapse as they drain water out of a cavern. Moe is caught under falling rubble, but Stephen, who in Vietnam had to leave his best friend to die in order to be rescued himself, is determined to save him, even if it costs him his own life. He frees Moe, but is hit by falling rocks himself, and though the two men are both rescued, Stephen is badly hurt and comatose, being put on life-support in the hospital.  While Stu and Lidia fear for their father's life, the Lipnickis find the treehouse and take it over, stealing the lock and key, which belonged to Stephen. However, they agree to return them if Stu can win a bet - swimming a lap around the inside of a water-tower while it drains - which he does. The children can keep the place, but not before the Lipnickis throw the key onto the rotted, treacherous roof of the water-tower, telling Stu that if he wants it, he can get it back himself. Shortly afterwards, their father is taken off life-support, and dies. When the kids run away from home to the tree house, they discover that the Lipnickis have returned. In the fight that erupts between them, the tree house is destroyed. Meanwhile, Billy Lipnicki protests against all the fighting, asking why they can't share the fort, but is ignored. He takes it on himself to go to the water tower to retrieve the key, but the roof caves in just as Stu and the others find him, and he almost drowns in the water tower. Stu rescues and resuscitates him together with Lidia, and Billy tells them he saw an angel, one who "looked like [Stu,] only bigger," (implied to be Stephen) who told him he had to stay on Earth and take care of his family.  From that time on the Lipnickis stop fighting with the others and stay out of their way, except for Billy, who becomes a good friend to them. The twins and their friends start to rebuild the tree house, but give it up after a couple of days due to lack of interest. Also, they find out that their father bought them a new house before he died and are happy to have a proper home again at last.

War of the Buttons (1994 film)
 In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in the 1960s, more precisely the centre of the bridge over the river that separates the Irish villages of Carrickdowse and Ballydowse, there is a white line that few young people dare cross. The boys of each village spend most of their time trying to upstage the other, whether over the sale of hospital raffle tickets, or something more important, such as deciding who is a "tosspot" and who is not, or, for that matter, defining "tosspot". This "War of the Buttons", in which the buttons from the enemies clothes are captured, has gone on as long as the youths can remember, and "to the death", though rarely does either group hurt more than its pride.  The leader of the ''Ballys'' is Fergus ([[Gregg Fitzgerald]]), the son of a pauper family and an unpromising student who lives in a trailer on the edge of Ballydowse with his mother and abusive stepfather. What Fergus lacks in education, he makes up for in leadership, and the youth of Ballydowse will follow him anywhere. The members of the Ballys include Marie (Eveanna Ryan), the narrator, who revisits her memories of what happened from her adult viewpoint. The leader of the ''Carricks'' is Jerome (John Coffey), the son of a wealthy family. He is nicknamed ''Geronimo'' after the [[Geronimo|Apache tribal chief]].  The story explores how events escalate, gang class differences (the original and main incentive for their war), Fergus's troubles with his oppressive environment, conflicts that arise when the adults of the villages discover the feud, and conflicts within the Ballys. Their tactics to "win" the war, including a nude ambush of their enemies, are shown in great detail. After a series of battles, Fergus denounces Riley (Thomas Kavanagh) as a traitor to the cause before the final showdown which has the Ballys attacking an abandoned castle ruin defended by the Carricks. The Carricks lose, and, taken prisoner, Geronimo himself cuts off his buttons and gives them to Fergus. While the Ballys celebrate in their headquarters, Geronimo, driving Riley's father's tractor like a tank, levels the Bally clubhouse.<ref name="TVGuide">[http://www.tvguide.com/movies/the-war-of-the-buttons/review/131110/ TVGuide, "The War of the Buttons"], ''TV Guide,'' accessed 8 March 2018</ref> This puts a bitter end to the War of the Buttons.  Finally fed up, the towns' adults, including Geronimo's father (Colm Meaney) and Fergus' abusive stepfather (Jim Bartley), reclaim their children. Fergus runs off to the mountains, where Geronimo follows him in an unspoken gesture of solidarity. After being captured, the two boys are put in the church orphanage, where they put aside their differences and become best friends. Marie narrates the coda, expressing that she married one of the boys, and that the other became the couple's closest friend, but she does not reveal whom she chose to wed.

At night, he joins François in the dormitory to chat. Finally, Serge draws François into an erotic relationship.  François discovers his homosexuality and develops a deep attraction for Serge, who had only acted out of curiosity. François confides this discovery to Maïté, who swallows her disappointment and encourages him to come out of the closet. When Serge becomes increasingly interested in Maïté, she declares herself to be interested in nobody.  Serge's brother Pierre dies while serving in the army in Algeria, and Maïté's mother suffers a nervous breakdown, having previously refused to help Pierre desert.

When Lilly's aunt asks her husband what will happen next, he says that one of the men will not come back. Lilly tries to get her uncle to let her join Henry's hunt, but Moses replies that she's a woman, and she can't hunt.

Late that night, Monty and Courtney find Simon collapsed in the hallway. Monty agrees to take Simon to see his long-lost son, Frank, even though it will mean missing his thesis deadline. The entire household sets off on a road trip. Monty convinces Frank to meet with Simon, and Frank berates Simon for leaving. When Frank's daughter approaches, Frank tells her that Simon is nobody and leaves. Simon breaks down and grabs a stone for a "memory". Simon expresses his desire to die alone, but Monty convinces him to return home with them; they take turns reading poetry to him before he dies. The four friends bury Simon in a cemetery, reading Simon's final obituary.  Monty meets with Professor Pitkannan. While Pitkannan disagrees with Monty's thesis and new approach to government, he appreciates his beliefs and effort. He regrets that because Monty turned his paper in late, he could not graduate [[summa cum laude]]. At the graduation ceremony, Monty grabs a stone for his own "memory".
