The man (Inspector Rajagopal) in the long coat comes to Murthy and Indira and tells them Vyasaraya is actually the pimp and has made a living cheating innocent girls like Indira. Before Murthy can tell the cop about Vyasaraya he gets down the train and Vyasaraya reappears. This time he has a knife; Murthy fights Vyasaraya and tries to find Inspector Rajagopal but cannot find her. In panic, Indira gets off the train and so does Murthy. They try to find a place to stay the night in Traveler's Bungalow. Indira is impressed by Murthy's gentle behavior ("Ee Kannigu Hennigu," a dream sequence song).  Indira reveals to Murthy that Vyasaraya paid Rs.1000/- to her poor mother with the promise that he'll ensure that Indira joins a drama company. Indira asks Murthy to take her to her hometown of Navilukere near Sagar, as he wants to go back to her mom and two younger sisters. He agrees to take her to her hometown in the morning; unfortunately in the morning Vyasaraya and his henchmen attack Murthy who suffers a head injury.

'''Act 2'''  Murthy is slowly trying to regain his life back after the Indira episode until he sees a drunk woman, Clara ([[Madhavi (actress)|Madhavi]]), driving her Premier Padmini on railway tracks. Murthy, being the gentleman as ever, finds out that she's staying in Gulmohar suite and drives her home. There he meets Clara's brother Anthony who reveals why Clara started drinking in the first place - Clara is engaged to get married to Reggie ([[Avinash]]). Reggie is revealed to be a drunk as well as womanizer who is caught cheating with Clara's best friend. This drives Clara to alcoholism. To ensure a change of scenery, Anthony brings Clara to Murthy's town (a hill station like Agumbe); but obviously the change has not worked as Clara is revealed to be drinking even during the day.  One day, Murthy comes to Clara's place looking for Anthony and they have an argument about the merits of alcoholism. Clara has turned out to become a misogynist - Murthy tries to change her mind ("Baaluvantha Hoove"). At the end of the song Clara realizes she needs to give up alcohol.  Clara and Murthy seem to take a liking to each other, but Murthy also has a hard time forgetting his past. Seeing trains always makes him depressed. During one of their many walks, Murthy reveals to Clara about Indira, and Clara is even impressed that Murthy has found a way to cope with his loss.  Clara and Murthy decide to get married.

Life's vicissitudes have only made him stronger.  '''Act 3'''  Murthy goes about his usual activities, specifically taking a harsh stance on offenses against women. He then makes his way to the Central Jail looking for a woman named Anandhi who has been in prison for three years. He is told that she is on her death bed in the hospital. At the hospital we learn that in her past life she was a madam at a brothel. Murthy would like her to aid his investigation and she insists that as quid pro quo Murthy should convince her estranged daughter Dr. Sarala who works in Mumbai to see her. Dr. Sarala is reluctant at first but is convinced by her husband to visit her ailing mother. Anandhi is overwhelmed to see her daughter but dies before Murthy can get any information from her, leaving Murthy with another dead end.  Later Murthy receives a letter from Anandhi which mentions that while she doesn't know where they are, the names of her three associates are Vyasaraya, Tipparaju and Kaatayya. Murthy sets his men on their trail. He then collects some letters from the late Anandhi's belongings.  Murthy's subordinates locate a man by the name Kaatesh who seems to have recently amassed a significant amount of wealth. Murthy calls Kaatesh under the false pretext of having recovered some stolen jewelry and vessels that belong to him. When Kaatesh denies having ever been burgled, Murthy convinces him to come to the police station to make a statement in writing. Having obtained a handwriting sample, he sends it off to be compared with the letters found among Anandhi's belongings. The comparison reveals that Kaatesh is indeed Kaatayya.  Murthy then brings Kaatesh in, having taken Kaatesh's daughters into custody earlier for leverage. Under duress Kaatesh reveals that Tipparaju is dead but Vyasaraya lives in Hubli.  Murthy heads to Hubli in search of Vyasaraya. He locates the house where Vyasaraya is running his prostitution racket. Murthy goes into the house disguised as an elderly Muslim man. He locates Vyasaraya's right-hand man and thrashes him into submission to reveal that Vysaraya left for Bangalore in that evening's train. Murthy follows the train and boards it in the next station.  While searching for Vyasaraya, Murthy notices a girl running and being chased by a couple of goons on the platform. He gets off the train and gives them a chase. When he catches up with the girl, he realizes it is Indira. Indira tries to attack Murthy, thinking he is one of the Vysaraya's henchman. Upon realizing it is Murthy, she breaks down and reveals what happened after Vysaraya took her from the Travelers Bungalow in a brief flashback: Indira killed the man who tried to molest her and has been constantly on the run since.  In the present, Vyasaraya appears with his goons and sarcastically mentions that it has been his pleasure to snatch Indira from Murthy every time. A fight ensues and Murthy takes down the goons. Vyasaraya, trying to escape, gets trapped on a railway track between one of the cross wedges. Seeing an oncoming train, he panics and is unable to pull his leg out.

Aces: A Story of the First Air War
 Recalling the stories of his late grandfather, a young man deliberates over the sale of a homebuilt replica of a [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5|S.E.5]] [[fighter aircraft]] they had built together. His grandfather's voice comes back to him, relating his experiences, beginning with his enlistment in 1914 as a soldier in Canada. After a time in the trenches on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as an officer in the infantry, he applies to become an aviator and is assigned to a balloon corps as an air observer.  Spotting for gunners is his first task, but the job is dangerous, as balloons draw the attention of [[anti-aircraft]] batteries (called "archie") and enemy aircraft. A parachute saves him when his balloon is shot down. His second transfer request to an aircraft squadron is quickly approved, mainly because there is a pressing need for replacements during the "[[Fokker Scourge]]" in 1915–1916, when Allied flyers were being shot down in large numbers by superior German Fokker aircraft.  Flying aerial reconnaissance missions in a [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|B.E.2C]] [[reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]]/[[bomber]] aircraft is just as harrowing. Although the air observers are armed and able to fight back, the crews call themselves "Fokker fodder". With the development of more capable Allied fighters, air superiority is slowly won back. On the ground, armies are no longer able to move without being observed from the air, leading to a blood-stained stalemate.  In the air, German ascendency in fighters reasserts itself, leading to "[[Bloody April]]", 1917. Until new Allied designs appear, the skies over the Western Front are ruled by German [[Flying ace|ace]]s such as Baron [[Manfred von Richthofen]], the "Red Baron". After being wounded, a final application to become a pilot is approved. The air war is still considered the realm of "knights of the air" by not only Canadians but also Americans signing up, even before their country enters the war. At the completion of his training in 1918, despite his background as an air observer, grandfather is a neophyte assigned to a fighter squadron at the front. Flying the new S.E.5, he takes part in air combat against seasoned German aces.  With his prospects grim, he beats "the odds" when the Armistice ends the conflict. The Canadian contribution to the air war has been remarkable: 10,000 aviators, including [[Billy Bishop|"Billy" Bishop]] and [[Raymond Collishaw]], among the top aces in the war.  His grandson resolves to keep the replica S.E.5 as a tribute to his grandfather and all the others who fought in the first air war.  
Addams Family Values
 Following the events of ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'', [[Gomez Addams|Gomez]] and [[Morticia Addams]] hire a [[nanny]], Debbie, to take care of their newborn son Pubert, after Wednesday and Pugsley's failed attempts to [[Fratricide|murder]] him. Unbeknownst to them, Debbie is a [[serial killer]] who marries rich bachelors and [[Mariticide|murders them]] [[Gold digging|to collect their inheritances]].  After Debbie seduces [[Uncle Fester]], [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]], the Addams' daughter, becomes suspicious. Debbie tricks Gomez and Morticia into believing Wednesday and her brother [[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]] want to go to [[summer camp]]. They are sent to Camp Chippewa, run by the overzealous Gary and Becky Granger, where they are singled out by the counselors, as well as popular girl Amanda Buckman, for their macabre dress and behavior. Joel, a nerdy bookworm who also does not fit in, becomes interested in Wednesday.  Debbie and Fester become engaged. At their bachelor and bachelorette parties, Debbie is horrified by the Addams family. On their [[honeymoon]], she tries to kill Fester by throwing a radio in the bathtub, but he survives. Frustrated, Debbie forces him to sever ties with his family; when they try to visit Fester at Debbie's mansion, they are removed from the premises. The Addams find to their alarm that Pubert has transformed into a rosy-cheeked, golden-haired baby. Grandmama diagnoses this as a result of his disrupted family life, and Gomez becomes [[Depression (mood)|depressed]].  At camp, Wednesday is cast as [[Pocahontas]] in Gary's saccharine [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] play. When she refuses to participate, she, Pugsley and Joel are forced to watch upbeat [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Disney]] and family films. Afterwards, Wednesday feigns cheerfulness and agrees to take part. During the performance, she stages a coup, capturing Amanda, Gary and Becky, and [[Arson|setting the camp on fire]]. She, Joel and Pugsley escape via a canoe, and Wednesday and Joel kiss.  Debbie tries to kill Fester by blowing up their mansion. When he survives, she pulls a gun and tells him she does not love him and is only interested in his money. [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]] intervenes and Fester escapes. Fester apologizes to Gomez, and Wednesday and Pugsley return, the family reunited. Debbie arrives and ties the family to [[Electric chair|electric chairs]], explaining that she [[Parricide|killed her parents]] and previous husbands for incredibly selfish and materialistic reasons while the Addams listen with sympathy and compassion. Upstairs, Pubert, who has returned to normal, escapes from his crib and is propelled into the room where the family is being held. Debbie throws the switch to electrocute the family, but Pubert manipulates the wires, reversing the current and electrocuting her, incinerating her into a pile of white ash.  Months later, at Pubert's first birthday party, Fester laments Debbie's loss but becomes smitten with another nanny, Dementia. In the Addams Family graveyard, Wednesday tells Joel that Debbie was a sloppy killer, and she would instead scare her husband to death. As Joel lays flowers on Debbie's grave, a hand erupts from the earth and grabs him; he screams while Wednesday smiles.

He is accompanied by Jim, a slave who worked for Huck's foster family, and escaped the family out of fear for being sold off.

Airborne (1993 film)
 Mitchell Goosen (McDermott) is a teenager from [[California]] who loves to surf and rollerblade.  His zoologist parents are given the opportunity for grant work in [[Australia]] for six months. Eager to accompany his parents to the surf-friendly shores of the South Pacific, he is dismayed to find out that he will not be joining them and instead will be living with his aunt and uncle in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], so as to finish the remainder of his high school semester.   He arrives in the midst of a winter storm to a blue collar Midwestern city, quickly coming to the realization that this is far from the free-spirited beach atmosphere that he has been accustomed to. To add to his disillusion, he meets his cousin Wiley (Green), who at first glance is an awkward teenager and whose parents' lifestyle and demeanor, though warm and hospitable, is a bit old-fashioned.  Mitchell's first day at school is met with the typical [[Comfort zone|fish out of water]] obstacles as he immediately grows to the disfavor and jealousy of the gritty [[ice hockey|hockey]] players who chastise Mitchell for his easy going "[[Maharishi]]" philosophy and "California" appearance. These antagonists include Jack (Conrad), Augie (Black), Snake (Vargas), Rosenblatt, and the Banduccis.   With an upcoming hockey game against the rival "[[preppy|preps]]", led by the aggressive and arrogant Blane, Wiley and subsequently Mitchell are asked to fill-in for two students, who are caught putting a laxative into one of their teacher's coffee (never shown in the film). Mitchell inadvertently scores a goal for the preps, cementing his disdain by the hockey players, and in particular Jack, who proceeds to tackle Mitchell while still on the ice, concussing him and leaving him unconscious for what appears to be hours.  Over the course of the next few weeks, Mitchell and Wiley are harassed relentlessly, but one bright spot comes in the form of a girl named Nikki (Powell), who Mitchell falls in love with, and she seems to reciprocate. During a double date with his cousin and Nikki's friend Gloria, Blane, who used to date Nikki, appears and physically confronts Mitchell and Nikki, who are only saved when Jack arrives to stand up for Nikki who, as it turns out, is also Jack's sister.   Jack attempts to make Mitchell fight him by making fun of his relationship with Nikki, but Mitchell doesn't fight back, and claims that despite all the torture Jack and his friends put on him and Wiley, he will never fight back, because he'll be going back to California in three months. Though Mitchell's claim stops Jack from attempting to fight him, it greatly disappoints both Nikki and Wiley; Nikki because Mitchell claims that he'll be glad when he goes back home, and Wiley because he thinks Mitchell should've done something, and not back away from the confrontation like he just did.  All the issues Mitchell has experienced culminates with a dream Mitchell wakes to which convinces him to peacefully confront the situation. Mitchell decides to proactively join Jack and his ice hockey brethren for a street hockey game against the preps. Mitchell does well in the game and though he doesn't fight back against Blane when he attacks him, he embarrasses him by pulling down his pants; this endears a change of heart from his teammates.  Snake, Augie, the Banduccis, and the rest of the hockey team, with the notable exception of Jack, solicit Mitchell's help and rollerblading expertise in a race down a harrowing street route termed Devil's Backbone against the preps to settle their score once and for all. It is agreed upon that the first team with three members crossing the finish line will be deemed the winner. An aggressive and athletic Snake reaches the finish first for Mitchell's team, but two preps swiftly follow suit.   Needing only one more person to win and with Blane in sight of the end, Blane decides to barrel into Mitchell but poorly times his attack and instead lands in the waters below. This leaves Jack and Mitchell in clear sight of the finish line, as they approach in tandem victory to the cheers of their awaiting schoolmates, and kisses of respective love interests. Mitchell has finally earned the respect of Jack and his friends, and he is lifted on the shoulders of a cheering crowd as the movie ends.  
The Airzone Solution
 ''The Airzone Solution'' takes place in a future Britain where pollution has reached a point where the populace must often wear filtration masks when they venture outside. AirZone, a powerful corporation, signs a lucrative deal with the government to deal with the problem. The public is told that AirZone plans to build giant filtration plants to clean the atmosphere, but environmentalists are skeptical, especially when people begin dying and disappearing around AirZone facilities.  Investigative filmmaker Al Dunbar (Davison) has been working with Anthony Stanwick (McCoy), the head of one radical environmental group, on a [[Michael Moore]]-style exposé documentary on AirZone. But when Dunbar's mentor, the mysterious Oliver Threthewey (Pertwee), says the documentary is useless without more direct proof of AirZone's intentions, Dunbar and Stanwick hatch a plan to infiltrate AirZone's headquarters and hack into their computer mainframe. Stanwick has been aided in this by Rachel ([[Heather Tracy]]), an AirZone employee who is acting as his "mole" within the organisation.  Meanwhile, Arnie Davies (Baker), a popular local television [[meteorologist]], is getting ready to go on the air, although he still has time to flirt with the make-up lady and with his girlfriend, journalist Ellie Brown (played by [[Nicola Bryant]], who had co-starred with Baker in both ''Doctor Who'' and ''[[The Stranger (video series)|The Stranger]]'' series).  Dunbar successfully infiltrates AirZone's offices, but sets off an alarm soon after hacking into the computer. Fleeing from the guards, Dunbar finds himself in a lab where Rachel — now a prisoner of AirZone — is being injected with a green fluid. He helps her to escape, but is killed in the process.  At the moment Dunbar dies, both Arnie and Stanwick experience a vision of his death; for Arnie, this occurs in the middle of a broadcast and he faints on the air. Later, after a recuperating evening with Ellie, Arnie feels better and gets ready to go to work — only to be shocked at seeing an apparition of Dunbar standing in his hallway. Dunbar urges Arnie to investigate AirZone.  Arnie continues to experience visions of Dunbar at work, and is unnerved when he learns that Dunbar had died the night before. After further disturbing displays both during his weather broadcast and again at home, Ellie suggests they investigate Dunbar's home. Ellie is not sure what to make of it when Arnie, relaying instructions from Dunbar, is able to guide her to a hiding place where Dunbar kept his spare key. Inside, Ellie and Arnie view Dunbar's incomplete documentary but must leave when a detective, carrying a warrant to seize any AirZone property, arrives.  Soon, Arnie finds himself meeting Stanwick and is reassured that his visions of Dunbar are not the result of insanity, as Stanwick also sees the apparition (as does, apparently, Threthewey). Together, Stanwick and Arnie locate Rachel, who is experiencing extreme physical distress as the result of whatever chemical or drug was being pumped into her body at AirZone. Before they can get her to hospital, she is abducted by a group of masked men. For Arnie, this sparks an obsession with finding the truth about AirZone, and during his next weather report, he takes a tangent to reveal to viewers that AirZone's pollution-filtering plants are in fact increasing the pollution in the atmosphere.  Meanwhile, Ellie is given the biggest assignments of her career: first interviewing the [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Environment Secretary]] (played by [[Michael Wisher]]) and then covering the public unveiling of AirZone's pollution reduction plan by the head of the company, Robin Archer ([[Bernadette Gepheart]]). But she is frustrated when Arnie interrupts the former in order to give Stanwick face-time with the minister, an act that riles MacNamara (Cummings), a mysterious figure who works on behalf of Archer.  At the press conference, attended by industry representatives from across Britain, Archer unveils AirZone's optimistic plan to reduce pollution, but her sermon is cut short by Arnie (who has been sneaked in by the now-convinced Ellie) brandishing a gun, who demands Archer reveal the truth about why people living near the plants have been dying and disappearing. She refuses, but Stanwick arrives, with Rachel in hand (having recovered her with the unexpected help of MacNamara). Rachel, and many other Britons, have been subject to genetic experiments, forcing them to grow gill-like appendages to their necks. The AirZone Solution is not to reduce pollution, but to instead increase it and instead create a new race of humans able to breathe the polluted air. With AirZone's scheme revealed to the public, it collapses. MacNamara actually works for [[MI5]] and apparently had been working against Archer from inside AirZone (and appears to have been behind Rachel's earlier abduction), and leaves saying the AirZone was a good idea, but a bad image. Out of nowhere, Threthewey appears and says that Al Dunbar would have been proud of the work done by Arnie, Ellie, and Stanwick. The origin of the Dunbar apparition, and why it appeared to Arnie and Stanwick, is left unexplained.

Nando, who sustained a head injury, falls into a coma, and Susana suffers harsh internal injuries.  As the sun sets, the survivors begin to make preparations for the night. Canessa discovers that the seat covers can be unzipped and used as blankets. The survivors go inside the fuselage and curl up beside one another to stay warm. Antonio, [[Roy Harley]], and Rafael Cano plug the gaping hole at the end of the fuselage with luggage to keep out the wind. Two passengers die during the night from their injuries. With nothing to hunt or gather on the mountain, Antonio declares they will use rationing when the survivors find a tin of chocolates and a case of wine. After seeing a plane fly past, they think it dips its wing, and the survivors celebrate. Expecting to be rescued the next day, everyone except Javier, his wife Liliana, and Antonio eat the remaining chocolates. This causes a quarrel among Antonio and several others.  Meanwhile, Nando regains consciousness. After learning of his mother's death, Nando watches over Susana vigilantly. Knowing she will die of her injuries within a few days, he vows to set off on foot and find a way out of the mountains. When Carlitos reminds him that he will need food, Nando suggests eating the flesh of the deceased pilots to give him the strength to survive the journey to find help. Susana dies from her injuries. The survivors listen to a radio for word of their rescue but are devastated to hear the search called off after day nine.  After great debate, the starving passengers decide to eat the flesh of their dead relatives and friends. Zerbino, Rafael, and Juan Martino set off to search for the tail of the plane in hopes of finding the batteries for the plane's radio to transmit their location. Among pieces of the wreckage, the teammates find additional corpses, but return to the group with news that the tail of the plane is likely a little farther away. Later in the week, an avalanche strikes the plane and fills much of the plane's interior with snow. Eight of the survivors are unable to escape and are smothered by the snow or freeze to death. A second team, made up of Nando, Canessa, and [[Antonio Vizintin|Antonio "Tintin" Vizintin]], sets out and find the tail of the plane. Unable to bring the batteries to the fuselage, they return to the fuselage to get Roy, who is thought to have experience with electrical equipment. They bring him to the tail of the plane (where the batteries are located) to see if he can fix the radio. When Roy is unsuccessful, the team returns to the fuselage once more.  Federico and Alberto die from their injuries soon afterward, as does Rafael, leading Nando to convince a reluctant Canessa to search for a way out of the mountains, taking Tintin with them. Two days into the journey, they send Tintin back to the fuselage so they can appropriate his rations and continue on their own. After a 12-day trek, the two escape the mountains and alert the authorities of their companions' location. As helicopters land on the mountain, the other 14 survivors celebrate.  In the present, Carlitos describes how the survivors later returned to the site of the crash and buried the corpses under a pile of stones, marked with a cross. The memorial to the 29 deceased and 16 survivors is shown.

He also convinces the diamond dealer that Trevor cannot be trusted with real diamonds and he gives him fake diamonds instead.  When he delivers them to the mob, they quickly spot them as fakes and assume Trevor switched them.

However, Andy decides to take his chances and shoots Billy anyway.

The Chief orders Amos to break into Andrew's home, hold the writer hostage, and give himself up, in exchange for free passage out of town. Armed with the shotgun given to him by the Chief, Amos enters the house under the Chief's direction and ties up Andrew. Andrew believes Amos is an assassin sent to kill him due to his published views against "white America".  As the press piles up outside of Andrew's home, the Chief calls Amos to release Andrew as soon as the press is in place, promising to leave Amos's name and face out of the news. While Amos waits, he turns on the news to see he has been betrayed, with his name and face all over the television. With his deal broken, Amos steps outside and demands a ransom for the famous author.  Andrew asks Amos how he came managed to come across the island and as Amos reveals his story, the Chief comes in the back door demanding Amos surrender. The Chief shows his true colors and his lack of concern with Andrew's well being, stating his opposition to Andrew living on the island. During a scuffle, Andrew hits the Chief unconscious with his frying pan and goes for the shotgun. Amos takes the gun back and tells Andrew he will remain his hostage.  With the Chief's handcuffs, Amos cuffs himself to Andrew and runs through the backwoods behind the home and hole themselves up in the Gillmans' home. Unable to find the key to the Gillmans' car, Amos decides to change his clothes and plan his escape. As Amos makes his plans, Amos and Andrew share their childhoods and their family stories with one another. The Gillmans return home and Amos demands the keys to their car, to which Mr. Gillman refuses stating the car was a cherished anniversary present from his second wife. The Chief, now free from captivity, once again demands Amos surrender, believing he is still somewhere in Andrew's home. When the Chief tells Amos he is not concerned with Andrew's safety and intends to prosecute him for assaulting him with the frying pan, Amos reveals he now holds the Gillmans hostage as well. With his two new hostages, Amos repeats his ransom demand.  As Amos, Andrew, and the Gillmans await the ransom, Amos shows the Gillmans' interview tape that the Chief had confiscated. Amos and Andrew watch the Gillmans' news interview, explaining how the incident started because they had seen a black man inside of the house and assumed he was up to no good, much to the Gillmans' embarrassment. A pizza Amos ordered arrives at the Gillman home, upon which Amos realizes the Gillman home is not surrounded by police as he thought.  Amos bids the pizza girl a fond farewell, and gives her the Gillmans' and the Chief's interview tape to give back to the press. Back in the Gillmans' home Amos demands the keys to the Gillmans' car, which Mr. Gillman still refuses to give up. With help from Andrew, Amos finds the key to the Gillmans' car. Amos invites Andrew to join him, declaring him his partner in crime, which disgusts Andrew. After a heated argument Andrew and Amos begin to fight, ending with Andrew telling Amos that some things he said about him may have been true, but he admits that it isn't too much to ask to set up his own stereo equipment without being declared a thief.  Back at Andrew's home, an associate of Andrew, Reverend Brunch, attempts to cash in on the publicity and appears, demanding the police, whom he believes to be holding Andrew, to release Andrew to himself and the crowd. In a scuffle between the crowd and the police, Andrew's home is set on fire. The pizza girl returns the interview tape to the reporters. The Chief sends out a man with his two bloodhounds to find Andrew, and Amos, as he is chased through a field, believing the bloodhounds to be attack dogs, rescues Andrew and the two watch as Andrew's home burns in the distance.  Still upset at the Chief, Andrew uses the Chief's wallet, which Amos had taken from him and sics the bloodhounds on the Chief using the new scent. In the middle of the news interview, the reporters reveal they know the truth about the incident. As the Chief realizes he no longer possesses the tape of his interview, the two bloodhounds chase him from the scene.  Amos and Andrew are shown having boarded a barge, now on the other side of the island, where Amos and Andrew meet up with Andrew's wife.

After Kurt admits to Chris that he is only behaving the way he does because of peer pressure, Chris convinces him to apologize to his friend Dan, who has also been bullied by Kurt and his gang.  Problems begin when Kurt starts to make advances towards Chris and he starts almost getting caught. His PE teacher notices he is looking at the girls in the locker room, and thinking Chris is a [[lesbian]], takes him to her office for a conversation. Chris, thinking she is talking to him about actually being a boy, admits his disguise. The PE teacher threatens to tell the principal the truth, but Chris convinces her not to do so by lying that he is a [[transvestite]] and enjoys dressing up in women's clothing. Later that evening, Marie visits Chris at home. His parents, unaware that Chris is going to school as a girl, mistake her for his girlfriend.  Dealing with Marie and his parents at the same time causes Chris some trouble, but he keeps up his subterfuge. However, when Kurt drops by to bring Chris flowers, his father Louis starts to think he is [[gay]].

When Louis finds out, he finally realizes Chris has been dressing up as a girl. Meanwhile, Chris attempts to kiss Marie while practicing their cheerleading choreography, but she pushes him away and runs off.  Encouraged by his PE teacher to tell the truth, Chris reveals himself to be a boy during a cheerleading performance. Kurt threatens to beat him up, but when Chris defends him for not being gay, they finally make peace. Marie feels betrayed, thinking that Chris only tried to get her in bed, but she eventually decides to forgive him.

Aspen Extreme
 T.J.Burke tires of his auto assembly worker job in Detroit, quits, and convinces his friend Dexter Rutecki to move with him to Aspen. After succeeding in the new instructor tryouts for the Aspen Ski School, they both become ski instructors, although T.J. secretly intercedes on Dexter's behalf. While T.J. advances to become the most popular instructor of the school during the season, he has to constantly watch out for Dexter, whose social skills are less honed and whose future is less bright. Along the way, they meet the young local radio DJ (Robin) as well as a rich cougar-ish woman (Bryce) who selects the most desirable new instructor each year for her latest plaything.  After watching the famous Aspen Powder 8 competition, T.J. and Dexter agree to team up to try to win the next season's award. While skiing out of bounds, T.J. falls into a large sinkhole in the snow, plunging many feet into a stream. Dexter rescues him, and because skiing out of bounds would get them fired, takes him to Robin's house so she can patch him up without notifying the ski school director.  Somewhat later, after losing control of a school client (a poor skier who ends up sliding out of control into downtown Aspen), Dexter is suspended from the school and eventually links up with the wrong crowd, including Tina, a beautiful girl with a mysterious background. Hard up for cash, Dexter reluctantly accepts an offer to act as a drug courier. When he gets spooked and dumps the drugs, he is assaulted in retribution and left to freeze outdoors in the Aspen winter. Again, T.J. rescues him by paying off the drug guys, with money borrowed from Bryce. T.J. then moves out from the house he shared with Dexter, and in with Bryce, who purchased his companionship with the loan.  After spending some interminable and unsatisfying time with Bryce, T.J. and Dexter awkwardly rekindle their friendship and reset their goal to win the Powder 8 competition. T.J. and Dexter decide to ski out of bounds in order to train for the upcoming event. While skiing outside the boundaries of Aspen, T.J. and Dexter set off an avalanche. Dexter suffers a tragic demise, while T.J. escapes with minor injuries. Later, in deep depression, T.J. comes to realize how his relationship with Bryce had no particular meaning, and writes of his and Dexter's friendship. The article is published in a major ski magazine, finally providing T.J. with some satisfaction for his writing efforts after many prior rejections. His friendship with Robin also reawakens, as they both mourn Dexter's loss.  T.J. is sought out by a newly hired young ski instructor to be his partner in the Powder-8. They win the competition, beating T.J.'s nemesis throughout the movie. The victory is bittersweet, as he remembers the dream that he and Dexter had of winning the Powder-8, and in the end, he and Robin reconcile as he finally reveals that he loves her.  
Arcade (film)
 Alex Manning (Megan Ward) is a troubled suburban teenager. Her mother committed suicide and the school counselor feels that she has not dealt with her feelings properly.  Manning and her friends decide to visit the local [[video arcade]] known as "Dante's Inferno" where a new [[virtual reality]] arcade game called "Arcade" is being test marketed by a computer company CEO who is more than willing to hand out free samples of the home console version and hype up the game as if his job is depending on it, and it is.  However, it soon becomes clear that the teenagers who play the game and lose are being imprisoned inside the virtual reality world by the central villain: "Arcade". It would seem that "Arcade" was once a little boy who was beaten to death by his mother, and the computer company felt it would be a good idea to use some of the boy's brain cells in order to make the game's villain more realistic. Instead, it made the game deadly. The game's programmer knew there would be a problem with this, and even tried, but failed, to convince the computer company, Vertigo/Tronics, to halt the game's release because of the company's unorthodox decision to use human brain cells in the game's development.  Nick and Alex enlist the help of the game's programmer and head to the video arcade for a final showdown with "Arcade" and his deadly virtual world. While Alex is able to release her friends from a virtual prison, she also ended up freeing the evil little boy, who taunts Alex in the final moments of the film.  In the original CGI version, however, the film ends on a somewhat happier note, with Alex, her friends, and Albert (the programmer) simply walking away from Dante's Inferno, with the donor's soul seemingly laid to rest.

Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman (1993 film)
 The film begins by following a tour group at a memorial museum dedicated to Nancy Archer. The patrons are shown a film with Dr. Loeb, who explains that the events surrounding Nancy Archer were true. Nancy was an heiress to her mother's fortune. Her father, Hamilton Cobb, hopes to use the money to gain control over the town they live in. Nancy sees her psychiatrist, Dr. Cushing, about her low self-esteem and bad marriage to Harry. Her husband frequently spends time with a beautiful mistress, Honey Parker, the town beautician, together with whom he discusses his plans to steal the family's business away from Nancy's father. Despite her attempts to confront Harry, Nancy cannot express her anger in a healthy manner, allowing both her husband and father to take advantage of her.  While driving one night out in the desert, she sees a UFO, which shines a bright light at her. Even though she knows she will be the town's laughing stock, she also knows what she saw was real. She finally convinces Harry to accompany her on another night time drive in the desert, but the UFO is nowhere in sight. Suddenly, the ship descends from the sky. Getting out of the car for a closer look, Nancy is trapped by a bright light and disappears along with the UFO. Harry quietly returns to town and does not even report the kidnapping to the local authorities, Sheriff Denby and deputy Charlie.  A dazed Nancy is later found atop Honey's salon and is brought home. Her father is suspicious that Harry left her out in the desert while Harry denies any wrongdoing. Harry accuses Hamilton of neglecting his own wife after she was locked away at a sanitarium. As the two men argue, Nancy loses her temper, shouting that she can speak for herself and her mother. Suddenly, to everyone's surprise, she begins to grow; her clothes tear and rip as her head goes smashing through the ceiling into the attic.  The next morning Nancy is relocated to a large stable. There she is introduced to Dr Loeb. He observed a hormonal surge that occurred during Nancy's growth. Scared, Nancy asks that he find a cure, while keeping it a secret. Unable to convince her to move to a "controlled, therapeutic environment", Dr Loeb explains to Harry that Nancy's condition is unique and precarious. The strain of her heart to sustain her new size would make any stress too dangerous for her. This gives Harry an idea to get rid of her.  As she grows, Nancy becomes more self-confident and strong-willed, empowered by her new strength over everyone else. Eventually, she invites Harry to dinner and discuss her physical, mental and emotional growth. She thinks it will make their marriage stronger and she has a number of other ideas. However, Harry speculates that more stress will overload her heart and blood pressure and that she will die, leaving the family business and its money to him.  Harry, pretending to be unhinged by Nancy's suggestions (but carrying out his plan to overload her heart so that she dies), deliberately insults and angers her so much that she faints from the stress, crashing into the stable. Escaping to Honey's salon, he celebrates Nancy's apparent death by offering her Nancy's diamond necklace. Nancy wakes up and searches through the town for Harry. As she approaches a drive-through theater, a quick reference to the [[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman|original 1958 film]] can be seen on the screen.  Finding Honey and Harry, Harry hides under the desk in pure fear. He crawls away, feeling more scared then he has ever felt; Nancy is back for revenge. Trying not to scream or cry, he runs to his car. Nancy follows him and dumps him in her hand. Capturing Harry, she flees into the desert with National Guard helicopters pursuing her. Stopped by some high voltage power lines and confronted by her father and the authorities, she asserts herself and announces her father's ambitions to buy out the town using her money.  Due to a miscommunication from the sheriff ("No one does anything 'til I say "Fire"!"), a sniper on the helicopter shoots Nancy. Taking a direct hit, she falls onto the power lines, but is rescued and taken away (with Harry still in her grip) by the UFO, proving her claims were real.  The crowds disperse, with Honey making a business agreement with Hamilton. Dr Cushing explains to the press that wherever Nancy is, she now has Harry all to herself. Inside the UFO, Harry is forced to undergo therapy with two other men under a tiny dome, watched over by Nancy and two other giantesses, and the spaceship flies away into the night.

Then under the pretense of marrying her, he takes her to the registrar office and then pushes her off the roof. The police start making investigations and Chopra hastily has the case closed to prevent any further embarrassment once the suicide note is discovered.

The Ballad of Little Jo
  [[Little_Joe_Monahan|Josephine Monaghan]] (Amis) is a young society woman who is seduced by her family's portrait photographer, and as a result, bears an illegitimate child. She is expelled from her family and home in disgrace, and with no other resources, she leaves her newborn son under the care of her sister and heads West.  On the road, Josephine discovers that her options are very limited. As a single woman traveling alone, she is viewed with suspicion, or as sexual prey for any man. She assists a traveling salesman ([[René Auberjonois]]) who subsequently tries to sell her services as a whore to passing strangers.  Seeing it as her only protection, Josephine scars her face, and begins to dress as a man &ndash; thus becoming "Jo."  At a mining camp in Ruby City, she meets Percy (McKellen) who takes her under his wing. Percy recommends Jo for a job at the stable, and teaches her about how to survive in the frontier.  But Percy nurses a deep suspicion of women, viewing them to be "more trouble than they are worth."  He later demonstrates his [[misogyny]] by slashing the face of a prostitute who refuses to give him [[oral sex]].  Jo no longer feels safe with Percy or her secret, so she accepts a job herding sheep, and heads for the mountains. After returning in the spring, Percy gives Jo a letter for her that he had received months earlier. The letter is from Jo's sister, and Percy having opened it, now knows ''he'' is a ''she''.  He is furious at being made a fool of by a woman and "a whore at that," referring to the mention of her son in the letter.  He attacks and tries to rape Jo, but she draws her gun and subdues him.  Largely ostracized by the town's people since the incident with the prostitute, Percy promises Jo he will not share her secret if she finances his journey out of the territory.  She agrees, though swears to him she will find him and kill him if he breaks his silence.  For five years she works as a shepherd, braving the deadly winters alone to the worry of her employer, Frank Badger (Hopkins), who has taken a liking to the "young man" he nicknames "Little Jo."  When Jo has enough money saved, she quits Badger, and buys her own homestead.  While frequently viewed as "peculiar", Jo is clearly educated, and earns the respect of the people in Ruby City and the surrounding territory.  A local girl, Mary, (Graham) has her eye on Jo.  Blind to the truth, most hope the two will [[Courtship|court]]. However, Mary ends up wedding her cousin, Lucas Brown, soon after Jo returns from her first winter as a sheep herder.  One day in town, Jo comes across a mob about to [[lynching|lynch]] a Chinese laborer for trying to "take our jobs."  Jo intervenes, and Badger insists the "[[chinaman (term)|chinaman]]", Tinman Wong ([[David Chung (actor)|David Chung]]), go to live with Jo to help with the homestead.  Tinman accompanies Jo to the homestead, and takes on the duties of cook and housekeeper. Though he seems slow-witted, Jo is not happy at having company forced upon her, and is afraid he will discover she is not a man.  She keeps as much distance as possible.  But Tinman easily discovers the truth about Jo, and in doing so, reveals he is far more intelligent than he has pretended to be—he, too, has been masquerading for his own safety.  Jo drops her guard and the two begin a love affair.  A feud begins to brew between the sheep herders and cattlemen who are moving into the territory.  The Western Cattle Company wants to buy up all the land in the area, and they kill anyone who does not comply. One by one, the sheep herders give in, or are murdered by masked gunmen. Jo has witnessed the brutal murders of too many of her friends, and the violence that will be necessary to win this kind of fight goes against her gentle nature.  This is a masculine quality that goes beyond her ability to "pass," so Jo dons a dress once again in a feeble effort to step back into a more traditionally feminine role.  Tinman argues that it will be impossible for her to go back being the society woman, urging her to keep the homestead, and stand against the cattlemen in the upcoming election.  Jo will not be swayed, and meets with the representative from the cattle company, Henry Grey ([[Anthony Heald]]) to tell him she will sell.  Tinman falls ill, and Jo summons Badger's wife (Snodgrass), who practices folk medicine, to tend him.  Badger comes along, and is furious when Grey arrives with his wife so that Jo can sign the final papers for the sale of the homestead.  Feeling betrayed by Jo for helping the cattle company to "squeeze me," Badger hits Jo, proclaiming, "By God, boy!  I thought you'd amount to something."  As Grey prepares the papers inside, Jo watches his wife who, through the warped glass, is visually reminiscent of Jo when she was a woman of society.  In an instant, Jo changes her mind and refuses to sell to Grey, who leaves in disgust issuing less than veiled threats.  Tinman recovers, and on election day, Badger and Jo ride to Ruby City but are met by several of Grey's masked gunmen.  Badger shoots one of the gunmen, but is wounded, so it is up to Jo to finish the fight. She kills the two remaining men, but the pain of the act of killing is clearly indicated on her face.  The plot jumps to many years later, after Tinman Wong has died.  Jo collapses while fetching water, and Badger finds her in bed, near death.  He takes her in his wagon to the Ruby City doctor, but she is dead before they arrive.  As Badger buys rounds of drinks at the saloon in memory of Little Jo, the undertaker rushes in with his shocking discovery—Little Jo was a woman. The town elders rush back to the undertaker's to inspect.  All stand around the preparation table in shock, all except Mrs. Addie (Cathy Haase), the saloon owner, who laughs and laughs.  Badger is furious at the betrayal by his friend, and because Jo "made a fool out of me."  He goes back to her homestead, and as he tears the place apart in anger, comes across the letter from her sister, and a picture of her as she lived as a woman.  In town, the people tie Jo's dead body to her horse for a photograph.  The final shot is of the newspaper story with the before-and-after photographs, and the headline, "Rancher Jo Was a Woman."

Batman: Mask of the Phantasm

A young Bruce Wayne meets [[Andrea Beaumont]] while visiting his parents' grave, and they form a deep mutual attraction. That night, in one of his first crime-fighting attempts, Bruce foils an armored car robbery, but is discouraged because the criminals did not fear him. Eventually, Bruce decides to abandon his plans to become a [[vigilante]] and proposes marriage to Andrea. However, Andrea mysteriously leaves Gotham with her father, businessman Carl Beaumont, ending her engagement in a [[Dear John letter|"Dear John" letter]]. Believing he has lost his last chance of having a normal life, Bruce becomes [[Batman]].  Ten years later, Batman confronts a group of [[Gotham City]] [[Organized crime|crime bosses]] led by Chuckie Sol, who are intending to [[money laundering|launder]] millions of [[Counterfeit money|counterfeit dollars]] in a casino. As Sol escapes to his car, a cloaked figure attacks him; Sol is killed when the figure causes him to drive out the side of a parking garage and crash into a neighboring building. Batman arrives soon after, and bystanders blame him for Sol's death. Councilman Arthur Reeves tells the media that Batman is a menace (despite [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]]'s protests). Attending a party at Wayne Manor, Reeves teases Bruce for allowing Andrea to leave him.  The cloaked figure murders another gangster, Buzz Bronski, in the same cemetery Bruce met Andrea. Batman investigates Bronski's death and wanders to his parents' tombstone. He overhears Andrea talking at her mother's grave, just as she had been when he first met her. She is startled by Batman's appearance and he flees. Batman finds evidence linking Carl Beaumont with Sol, Bronski and a third gangster: Salvatore Valestra. He breaks into Valestra's home and discovers a photograph of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont seated at a table. When he visits Andrea to try to get more answers she rebuffs him, intimating she now knows his identity. Meanwhile, Valestra believes Batman killed the others and will come for him, so he turns to [[Joker (character)|the Joker]] for help.  The figure arrives at Valestra's house but finds the gangster dead by Joker's hands. Joker has strapped a camera to Valestra's corpse and sees the murderer is not Batman. The figure escapes as the house explodes. Batman pursues and fights the killer, but is interrupted by the police and rescued from arrest by Andrea. Andrea later explains she and her father had been hiding in Europe from Valestra's mob, from whom he had [[embezzlement|embezzled]] money; her father repaid everything, but they put out a hit on him anyway. Bruce now believes her father is the killer. Bruce ponders resuming his relationship with Andrea and giving up Batman. He notices a familiar-looking man in the background of the photo of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont: the man who would become the Joker. Joker visits Reeves to press him for information; Reeves insists that the cloaked killer is Batman, but Joker, believing Reeves is the killer, states Reeves needs to protect his own reputation and poisons him. Reeves is taken to the hospital where Batman later breaks in and interrogates him. Reeves confesses he helped the Beaumonts escape and later told Valestra's mob their location.  The cloaked figure tracks Joker to his hideout, where Joker reveals that he has deduced that the killer is Andrea, intent on avenging her father's death by killing every last surviving member of Valestra's mob. With the others dead, Joker is the last one alive, and is the one who carried out the hit on her father. Joker fights her, but just before he can kill Andrea, Batman arrives and begs Andrea to give up her quest. She refuses and disappears. Batman and the Joker battle to a stalemate. Moments later Andrea returns and seizes Joker, bidding Batman goodbye before vanishing with the maniacally laughing clown. The amusement park erupts in a series of explosions and Batman barely escapes. [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] later consoles Bruce, telling him that no one could have helped Andrea. Bruce finds her locket, containing a picture of himself and Andrea, in the [[Batcave]]. Meanwhile, Andrea departs from Gotham alone on an ocean liner, feeling completely lost. Batman stands on top of a Gotham building when the [[Bat-Signal]] appears in the sky, and swings off into the night to continue his war on crime.

She reclaims Missy and plans to get rid of the puppies, even if it means killing them, but Gus points out that [[Pedigree (animal)|pedigree]] St. Bernards are worth a lot of money and suggests that Regina sell them.  Thinking Regina plans to drown the puppies, Ted and Emily manage to sneak them past Regina and take them home. They keep them in the basement so George, who they know would not want to deal with them, will not find them. Realizing they took the puppies, Regina plans revenge.

Missy escapes from the car with Beethoven's help while Regina sneaks behind the children and snatches the puppies from them. Beethoven and Missy run into the mountains, followed by Regina and Floyd.

He loses his balance, Regina grabs his hand, and they fall over the cliff into a pool of mud, which breaks, thus they are swept away in the river.  Five months later, Brillo visits the family with Missy, revealing that the judge in the divorce had granted him full custody of her and denied Regina's claim. The puppies, almost grown up by then, run downstairs to see Missy.

Travis has been secretly competing at "The Coliseum", a brutal underground fighting arena run by Weldon, whose protégé Brakus is the owner and undefeated champion. Ordinarily a challenger must defeat three of its "Gladiators" in order to face Brakus, but Travis challenges Brakus outright. Amused by Travis's arrogance, Weldon grants his wish.

Brakus pummels Travis and breaks his neck, killing him.  Walter runs home and alerts his father and Tommy, and together they proceed to the dance club which serves as a front for the Coliseum. They are intercepted by Weldon, who claims that Travis left the Coliseum on his own. Tommy searches the city until the police find Travis's body floating in the river along with his damaged car, the apparent result of an auto accident.  Alex and Tommy return to the club and confront Brakus, who admits to killing Travis. Tommy connects with a punch that sends Brakus crashing into a mirror, scarring his cheek.

There they encounter Tommy's uncle James, a once-promising fighter whose career was ruined due to a clash with Brakus. Claiming to know how to defeat him, James begins to train Alex and Tommy.  Their training does not last long as Weldon's henchmen track them down. James tries to intervene but is shot to death. While Tommy is forced into the waiting helicopter, Alex and the others are herded back into the house. As Weldon's men prepare to execute them and blow up the house, Walter provides a distraction which enables Alex to overpower the gunman. Tommy's grandmother prompts Alex to fire four shots to signal their deaths, at which point the thugs set fire to the gasoline trail, causing a massive explosion. After emerging from the cellar unharmed, Alex leaves Walter with his girlfriend Sue, then recruits Dae Han and his Korean teammates to storm the Coliseum and rescue Tommy.  At the Coliseum, Tommy fights his way through the Gladiators, but is outmatched by Brakus. As Brakus prepares to finish him, Alex breaks into the arena, his presence giving Tommy a second wind.

With his champion defeated, Weldon announces Tommy as the new owner of the Coliseum and invites him to say a few words to the audience. Tommy takes the microphone and declares the Coliseum closed. When Weldon protests, Alex silences him with an elbow to the face. Alex and Tommy leave the arena and turn off the lights.

The next day Baby, Eda, Milada, Bejbina, and several others members of the gang go to see a rock'n'roll band called The Red Devils. On the journey home their car crashes into a lake, and they are forced to take it to the mechanic workshop of one of their fathers. While there an argument starts between Eda and Baby over Bejbina, during which Eda tells Bejbina that Baby has got Milada pregnant. One of the gang members who is present for the argument tells his father, a communist informer, who tells Milada's husband, a senior communist dignitary, what has happened. Furious, the husband comes to Prikop's house to look for Baby, injuring Prikop in the process. After he leaves Prikop offers Baby a conciliatory meal, during which he realises he has recovered his taste.  Baby is forced to leave town, but all the characters' lives have been touched by his presence. The film descends into a series of more abstract musical numbers, during which Eda, having lost Bejbina but realising the error of his ways, ruins a communist party event at the hotel by bursting into song. Eda then leads the gang in an arson attack on a car driven by a party chauffeur, and the gang are observed happily reunited, including Eda and Bejbina. The film ends with a solo performance outside the school from Ksanda, who has fully adopted Baby's style and attitude.

Blood In Blood Out
  Miklo is a man of Mexican and White American ethnicity who grew up in El Pico Aliso [[barrio]] in east Los Angeles. Upon moving back home from [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], Miklo goes to stay with his two cousins Paco and Cruz. Miklo tells Cruz that he wants to join their gang ''Vatos Locos''. While Paco is initially skeptical, Miklo later proves himself when he performs an attack on a rival gang, ''Tres Puntos''. Afterwards he is made a member of ''Vatos Locos''.  However, the ''Tres Puntos'' gang soon takes revenge by brutally attacking Cruz who is a budding artist, and damages his back for life. When ''Vatos Locos'' learn of the attack, they perform a well-planned counterattack. However, things go wrong when Miklo ends up getting shot by their rival gang's leader, "Spider". Miklo is able to shoot and kill Spider, but has to be rushed to the hospital by Paco while being chased by police. Paco crashes into another car at the [[El Pino (The Pine Tree)|El Pino tree]] and they are both arrested.  From here, the trio's paths diverges: Miklo is sent to [[San Quentin State Prison]] for murder, Paco volunteers for military service in the [[United States Marine Corps]] as an alternative choice to prison, and Cruz continues his passion for art. He also becomes a [[heroin]] addict due to the recurring back pain. His addiction leads to him being disowned by his family after his 12-year-old brother, Juanito, dies from injecting heroin into his veins thinking it's Cruz's heroin supply. Paco becomes an [[Los Angeles Police Department|L.A.P.D.]] narcotics detective after leaving the Marine Corps.  Miklo finds trouble adapting to prison life. The prison is run by three [[prison gang]]s, all of whom are based on their racial backgrounds. The ''Black Guerrilla Army'' (B.G.A.) is led by "Bonafide", the ''Aryan Vanguard'' is led by "Red Ryder", and ''La Onda'' is led by Montana Segura. ''La Onda''s members do not initially accept Miklo and one of them, Popeye, tries to rape Miklo at knife-point, but is stopped by Montana (although Montana stops Popeye not out of concern for Miklo, but because he finds Popeye's intentions as dishonorable to ''La Onda''). After meeting Montana, he is told the only way into ''La Onda'' is killing an enemy inmate, in Miklo's case a white inmate named Big Al who runs the gambling in San Quentin. After gaining Big Al's trust, Miklo stabs him to death during a sexual encounter in the prison kitchen. Miklo is initiated into ''La Onda'', is later promoted to its Ruling Council, and is granted parole after serving nine years in prison.  On the outside, Miklo is disgusted by his menial job on which his supervisor is extorting money from him, so he joins in an armed robbery. The heist goes poorly and Miklo is intercepted by Paco, now a decorated cop. Miklo tries to run away, but Paco shoots him in the leg, which later has to be amputated. Miklo is sent back to prison where he notices the cocaine addictions of several inmates. ''Onda'' Council Member Carlos has entered the cocaine trade and is competing with the ''B.G.A.'' for customers. The ''Aryan Vanguard'' want to partner with Carlos in the cocaine business by becoming his new supplier. In return, Carlos moves on the ''B.G.A.'' and take them out of the cocaine business. Montana, however, is fiercely against allowing ''La Onda'' to enter the drug trade, saying that drugs will destroy ''La Onda'' and that the ''Aryan Vanguard'' want to start a war between the Black and Chicano inmates. The other Council members agree with Montana and vote against it. This causes Carlos to leave ''La Onda'' to work with the ''Aryan Vanguard'', causing other members to follow him. Carlos murders a B.G.A. soldier named "Pockets" who is running the B.G.A.'s cocaine operation. He also contacts his brother, Smokey, outside of prison to bomb a B.G.A. hangout where they move their drugs. After all of this happens, Carlos' usefulness has come to an end and the ''Aryan Vanguard'' drops their protection of him. The ''B.G.A.'' then takes the opportunity to murder Carlos. Despite his death, Miklo agrees with Carlos's outlook after being convinced by Carlos's old drug supplier.  With hostility high between the Black and Hispanic inmates, Montana and Bonafide meet in the prison yard. Montana convinces Bonafide to agree to a truce if Montana reaches out to ''La Onda'' leaders in the Folsom and Chino prisons to end the violence. The warden grants Montana special permission to visit the Chino and Folsom prisons and Miklo is left in charge during his absence. Montana is granted a special request, and he gets to stay overnight at Delano penitentiary where he can see his daughter. On the morning of the visit, Montana is stabbed to death outside his cell by a member of the ''B.G.A.''. Believing that the ''Aryan Vanguard'' sent forged orders to the hitman, Paco arranges a peace conference between ''La Onda'' and the ''B.G.A.'' However, Miklo, ''La Onda's'' new leader, manipulates the peace talks in order to build an alliance with the ''B.G.A.'' and they agree to kill the ''Aryan Vanguard'' leaders.  Later, enforcers for ''La Onda'' and the ''B.G.A.'' sweep through the walls of San Quentin, killing the leaders of the ''Aryan Vanguard''. After the killings are done, however, Miklo's men promptly exterminate the ''B.G.A.'' leaders as well. Paco is enraged that his own cousin has played him for a fool and angrily confronts Miklo in the prison visiting room. Paco leaves his cousin in disgust, disowning him forever.  The members of ''La Onda'' hold a final gathering after the warden vows to split the council up transporting some members to their home states. Miklo plans on using this to expand ''La Onda'' to other states in the South West. Later, Miklo and his cellmate "Magic" destroy the mold which they used to send the forged orders to the ''B.G.A.'' hit man to kill Montana. Magic says "We both loved him, but we did what we had to do for ''La Onda.''" Back in East Los Angeles, Paco visits one of Cruz's murals after the family re-accepts him to see a portrait of his former life. In a pep talk with Cruz, Paco realizes that by ordering Miklo to go after Spider, Paco is responsible for all of the things that have happened to Miklo. This causes Paco to feel guilty for his actions and ultimately forgive Miklo.  
Blown Away (1992 film)
 After her mother dies in a mysterious car accident, 17-year-old Megan ([[Nicole Eggert]]), daughter of a wealthy businessman, lives a reckless lifestyle. A year later, she is almost killed by a horse who has lost control, though she is rescued by Rich ([[Corey Haim]]), a young man who works at the ski resort owned by her father Cy ([[Jean LeClerc (actor)|Jean LeClerc]]). Grateful, she invites him to her party, where she thanks him again by being intimate with him in her father's bed. The next morning, Cy comes home and almost catches them. Even though he does not, he angers Megan by forbidding her to see any guys. Unlike Cy, Rich's girlfriend Darla ([[Kathleen Robertson]]) does find out about the affair, and dumps him. Rich wastes no time and enters into a passionate relationship with Megan. She soon introduces him to her father, but he disapproves of him, and Megan tells Rich that they cannot see each other any longer.  Devastated, Rich turns to his womanizing half-brother Wes ([[Corey Feldman]]) for comfort, who encourages him to do everything to get Megan back. He follows her to a bar, where she is seen giving a large sum of money to a criminal-looking man. Rich catches her getting intimate with the guy, and knocks him down as a response. Megan then apologizes to Rich, and claims that she did not think that he really loved her and was only testing him in order to see how much he would be willing to do for her. He immediately takes her back, and they accompany each other to a bar, where Wes always hangs out with his friends. While Rich is arguing with Darla, who accuses him of going out with her only because of her money, Megan is seen talking with Wes. As they go to their home together, they run into Cy, who calls his daughter a slut for bringing a boy home, resulting in a huge fight between them.  Rich decides to go home, where he finds Wes sleeping with Darla. Enraged, he tries to beat up Wes, but Darla stops them by informing Rich that he does not own her; later, Rich apologizes to Wes, saying that he should not have taken his feelings of anger out on him, and Wes accepts (while remarking that it had been a while since they "had a few rounds"), and then apologizes for what he did. Rich decides to return to Megan's place, where she — fed up with fighting with her father — convinces him that her father killed her mother and that they should kill him, and run off with the money. However, Rich, blinded by the potently [[sexual relationship]], is in two minds about what to do.  The next day, Rich and Wes are shocked to find out that Darla has been killed in a horse riding accident. Meanwhile, Megan turns out hospitalized and claims to Rich that her father is to blame. Rich, seeing how severely beaten up she is, fears losing her someday to Cy's abuse, and promises her to help her. As they return home, Megan tells Rich that she has placed a bomb in his bike, and that 'it will all be over soon'. The next morning, Rich is invited by Cy to accompany him on a bike ride, causing Rich to witness the explosion that throws him almost off a cliff. As Cy falls to his death, he tells Rich that he did not kill his wife. Rich starts to suspect that Megan may not be who he thinks she is, and meanwhile, he becomes the prime suspect in Cy's death in the investigation of Detective Anderson ([[Gary Farmer]]). Despite Anderson's attempts to make him turn in Megan, Rich denies any involvement in the entire ordeal, though evidence points against him. Wes is shocked that his brother would have killed anyone, and is mad at him for not having killed their own abusive father.  Shortly later, Megan bails out Rich, and gives him her car to skip town with. She promises him that she will follow him soon after collecting her father's money. Rich drives off. However, now distrustful of Megan, he checks the car and finds a bomb in it. He is able to get away just in time for the explosion and immediately rushes to her house.  There, it is revealed that Megan and Wes were lovers all along and planned the murders and schemes together in order to be together. Rich confronts his half-brother, and Wes informs him that he tried to frame him because he has always hated him. As Wes is about to shoot Rich, Megan kills Wes. She tries to put the entire blame on Wes, but Rich does not believe her, prompting her to reveal that she was the mastermind behind it all. As she tries to shoot Rich, the police arrive, killing Megan immediately in self-defense. Rich was wired throughout the final scene, which clears him from all charges (although he has nobody important in his life anymore, leaving him empty inside).

Body Bags (film)
 ; Prologue A creepy-looking [[coroner]] introduces three different horror tales involving his current work on cadavers in "body bags".  ==="The Gas Station"=== Anne is a young college student who arrives for her first job working the night shift at an all-night filling station near [[Halloween (1978 film)|Haddonfield, Illinois]] (a reference to the setting of Carpenter's two ''Halloween'' films). The leaving worker, Bill, reminds her that a [[serial killer]] has broken out of a [[psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]], and cautions her not to leave the booth at the station without the [[key (lock)|key]]s because the door locks automatically. After Bill leaves, Anne is alone and the [[tenseness|tension]] mounts as she deals with various late-night customers seeking to buy gas for a quick fill-up, purchase cigarettes or just use the restroom key, unsure whether any of them might be the escaped [[mania]]c. A homeless transient asks to use the restroom, and when a partying couple arrives, she asks the man to check on the bum. He says he's sleeping. She goes inside the men's restroom, only to find an elaborately grotesque drawing on a evil looking entity carrying beheaded people in the Restroom and then the dead body of the man sitting in a pickup truck on the lift in one of the garage bays. She makes a phone call for help which results in her realization that "Bill", the attending worker she met earlier, is in fact the escaped killer, who has killed the real Bill and is killing numerous passers-by. She finds the real Bill's dead body in one of the [[locker]]s. Serial Killer "Bill" then reappears and attempts to kill Anne with a [[machete]], breaking into the locked booth by smashing out the glass with a [[sledgehammer]] and then chasing her around the deserted [[Filling station|garage]]. Just as he is about to kill her, a customer returns, having forgotten his [[credit card]], and he wrestles the killer, giving Anne time to crush him under the vehicle lift.  ==="Hair"=== Richard Coberts is a middle-aged businessman who is very self-conscious about his thinning hair. This obsession has caused a rift between him and his long-[[suffering]] girlfriend Megan. Richard answers a [[television]] [[advertisement|ad]] about a "miracle" [[hair transplant]] procedure, pays a visit to the office, and meets the shady Dr. Lock, who agrees to give Richard a solution to make his hair grow back. The next day, Richard wakes up and removes the [[bandage]] around his head, and is overjoyed to find that he has a full head of hair. But soon he becomes increasingly [[Nausea|sick]] and [[fatigue]]d, and finds his hair continuing to grow and, additionally, growing out of parts of his body, where hair does not normally grow. Trying to cut a hair off his mouth, he finds that it "screams", and, examining it under a [[magnifying glass]], sees that it's alive and resembles a tiny serpent. He goes back to Dr. Lock for an explanation, but finds himself a prisoner as Dr. Lock explains that he and his entire staff are [[extraterrestrial life|alien]]s from another [[planet]], seeking out [[narcissism|narcissistic]] human beings and planting [[seed]]s of "hair" to take over their bodies for consumption as part of their plan to spread their essence to Earth.  ==="Eye"=== Brent Matthews is a [[baseball]] player whose life and career take a turn for the worse when he gets into a serious [[car accident]] in which his right [[eye]] is gouged out. Unwilling to admit that his career is over, he jumps at the chance to undergo an [[experiment]]al [[surgical procedure]] to replace his eye with one from a recently deceased person. But soon after the [[surgery]] he begins to see things out of his new eye that others cannot see, and begins having [[nightmare]]s of [[necrophilia|killing women and having sex with them]]. Brent seeks out the [[Physician|doctor]] who operated on him, and the doctor tells him that the [[organ donor|donor]] of his new eye was a recently executed [[serial killer]] and necrophile who killed several young women, and then had sex with their dead bodies. Brent becomes convinced that the [[spirit]] of the dead killer is taking over his body  so that he can resume killing women. He flees back to his house and tells his skeptical wife, Cathy, about what is happening. Just then the spirit of the killer emerges and attempts to kill Cathy as well. Cathy fights back, subduing him long enough for Brent to re-emerge. Realizing that it is only a matter of time before the killer emerges again, Brent stabs his donated eye with garden scissors, severing his link with the killer, but then bleeds to [[death]].  '''Epilogue''' The coroner is finishing telling his last tale when he hears a [[noise]] from outside the [[morgue]]. He crawls back inside a [[body bag]], revealing that he himself is a living cadaver, as two other morgue workers begin to go to work on his "John Doe" corpse.  
Bopha!
  The film opens with a black crowd burning alive a black police officer, from a nearby ghetto that they regard as a traitor.  It then switches to the peaceful home of Micah Mangena, a black sergeant in the [[South African Police]].  His son Zweli Mangena increasingly questions Micah belief and Micah's wish that Zweli would follow him into the police.  Micha's wife also has doubts as the once-peaceful township gets polarised and her neighbours start treating her as an enemy.  The initial issue is the use of [[Afrikaans]] in the all-black school.  The school children speak [[South African English|English]], Afrikaans and their own African [[Languages of South Africa|language]], but they resent being taught Afrikaans.  To reply in English is an act of rebellion.  Zweli dislikes the system but fears the consequence of open opposition.  He arranges a meeting between some of the hot-heads and Pule Rampa, a respected figure who has been in prison for anti-Apartheid activities.  He seems to be trying to calm the situation, but the police have learned of the gathering and break it up, arresting some of the students and also Pule Rampa.  He had been trying to slip away quietly, but Micah anticipates this and arrests him.  Micah is in charge of the operation and has attempted moderation, letting some of the students go free.  Micah wants to conduct his own questioning.  But two members of South Africa's Special Branch have recently arrived and take over.  They employ much more brutal methods.  Both Micah and his white superior suggest to the Special Branch men that they are perhaps provoking opposition rather than quelling it, by torturing and hanging Pule in his cell.  The situation does indeed escalate. Micah and Zweli are increasingly on opposite sides of a widening gap, even though each of them genuinely cares for the other.

Despite the attempts made to warn the townsfolk from a previous test subject, who is now undergoing rapid cellular decay, he arrives too late, and crashes his car and is killed by [[tentacle]]s growing out of his [[throat]]. The pills are consumed by the residents, and produce liquefying flesh, elongated tongues, exploding stomachs, exploding [[penis]]es, imploding heads, monstrous births, tentacles growing out of the [[face]], living [[mucus]], sentient [[placenta]]s, and other gruesome mutations. Ultimately more and more of the residents of the Pebbles Court mutate or die horrific deaths, until almost every character has been dispatched.

In the restroom, Marti is threatened by an [[military police|MP]] member with a knife. When he notices her fear, he lets go of her, satisfied that she shows an emotional response. Before she leaves the room, he warns her, "they get you when you sleep".  Steve and his family move into their new home on the base, and Marti makes friends with the base commander's daughter Jenn. On his first day in [[day care]], Andy runs away because he is recognized as an outsider among the other somehow [[Conformity|conformist]] children. He is picked up and brought home by helicopter pilot Tim. Marti and Tim quickly feel attracted to each other. Meanwhile, while examining soil samples, Steve is approached by medical officer Major Collins, who asks him about [[Psychology|psychological]] effects, particularly narcophobia (the fear of sleep), and their possible relation to toxication of the environment. Steve believes that a [[Physiology|physiological]] reaction would be more likely.  In the evening, Marti and Jenn go to the bar attended by the station's military personnel, where they meet not only Tim but also the MP who threatened Marti at the gas station. He denies that they ever met before. That night, a group of soldiers can be seen picking giant [[Legume|pods]] from the river running by the base. When Andy wakes up and enters his mother's room, Carol's body crumbles to dust, while a naked soulless double emerges from the closet. Nobody believes Andy's story that his real mother is dead and the person pretending to be Carol is only an impostor.  The following night, Marti and her father are nearly "taken over" too by duplicates emerging from the giant pods. Carol attempts to convince Steve that the takeover is a good thing, claiming that it ends confusion and anger. She also claims that there's no place to go, as the invasion is not an isolated incident. Steve is almost shocked and saddened into compliance, but Marti and Andy drag him out the door. Carol emits a shrill and mechanical scream that alerts other "pod people" to the presence of a human being. Now the majority in numbers, they swarm over the base chasing the remaining humans.  After hiding Marti and Andy in a warehouse, Steve enters Major Collins' office. The hysterical Major tries to call for help, but the line is blocked. While swallowing sleep-prevention pills Collins announces that it is too late to run; all they can do is fight. Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of a group of pod people, led by base commander General Platt. While Steve hides, the pod people try to convince the Major that the individual is not important, and that only conformity can solve the world's problems. The Major shoots himself rather than live in such a world.  Steve returns to his children and tells them to follow him, claiming to have found a way out. They drive aimlessly through the military base, as loudspeakers shout out instructions for spreading the invasion by carrying out pods in trucks. Realizing that her father was replicated while he was away, Marti swerves the car to the side and tries to escape with her brother. Tim, who escaped his former comrades who tried to turn him into one of them, suddenly appears and Marti takes his gun and shoots the person pretending to be her father. The Steve duplicate shrinks into a mass of seething, bloody goo.   Tim manages to get hold of a helicopter [[gunship]], but Marti and Andy are taken away by the pod people. They sedate both of them and take them to the base [[Hospital|infirmary]] where the remaining human beings are being systematically duplicated by pods. Tim is able to rescue Marti, despite her pod duplicate trying to seduce him into compliance.  Marti and Tim leave the building, pretending to be pod people so they can get to Tim's helicopter to escape. However, they are spotted by Jenn, now a pod duplicate, who gets suspicious and tells Marti she saw Andy looking for her. When Marti reacts displaying emotion, Jenn responds by giving out a pod scream to alert the other pod people. Tim and Marti manage to get in the helicopter and are joined at the last minute by Andy who runs up to them. But right after taking off, Andy, who is in reality a pod duplicate, attacks both and tries to bring down the helicopter. After a short scuffle, Marti is forced to throw Pod-Andy out of the helicopter and he gaves out a pod scream while falling to his death.  The ending of the film is an ambiguous one. Tim destroys the trucks filled with pods with the helicopter's rockets, while Marti confesses her profound hatred in a [[voice-over]] narration, thereby hinting at a loss of [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] quality. While they land on another base, the words of Marti's stepmother earlier in the film can be heard, suggesting that the phenomenon may have already spread beyond the army base: "Where you gonna go, where you gonna run, where you gonna hide? Nowhere... 'cause there's no one like you left."  
Born Yesterday (1993 film)
  A wealthy but crude businessman, Harry Brock, on a trip to the nation's capital, is socially embarrassed by his ditzy and rather uncultured [[showgirl]] blonde girlfriend, Billie Dawn. He hires a reporter, Paul Verrall, to "teach her the ropes."  Harry comes to regret it when Billie not only becomes more savvy, questioning his unscrupulous deals and refusing to cooperate in ways she normally would, but also falls in love with Paul.  
Body of Evidence (1993 film)
 An older man, Andrew Marsh, views a homemade pornographic tape. It is later revealed the man died from complications stemming from [[erotic asphyxiation]]. The main suspect is the woman who has sex with Marsh in the film, Rebecca Carlson, who after being charged with murder is represented by lawyer Frank Dulaney. The trial begins in [[Portland, Oregon]], and it is not long before Carlson and Dulaney enter a [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] sexual relationship behind the back of Dulaney's unsuspecting wife.  During their first sexual encounter, Dulaney, overcome by lust, notices too late that Carlson is tying his arms behind his back using his own belt. Carlson pushes him onto the bed, removes his underwear, and while he is restrained, she humiliates him by pouring hot candle wax on his chest, stomach, and genitals, amused by the frustration and increasingly desperate reactions she is eliciting from Dulaney. The two then have sex with Carlson in complete control, an obvious counterpoint to their relationship in the courtoom, where Dulaney is the one in control.  Carlson proclaims her innocence to Dulaney in private and in court, but [[district attorney]] Robert Garrett seeks to prove that Carlson deliberately killed Marsh in bed to receive the $8 million he left her in his will. The testimony of Marsh's private secretary, Joanne Braslow, reveals that he had a sexual relationship with her that could have contributed to his death, casting a reasonable doubt as to Carlson's guilt.  Dulaney can not resist Carlson sexually but does not trust her. He maligns Carlson with accusations of her withholding information from him. She plays off timid and upset while he gets angry at her. He makes it clear their affair needs to end and implies he may drop her as a client. That night he goes to the restaurant where his wife works, and she appears clearly upset. She tells him Carlson called her and accuses him of sleeping with her. Dulaney initially plays it off as if she is paranoid, but when she reveals telltale evidence, it is clear he can no longer deny it. She storms off.  Dulaney goes to Carlson's home and angrily demands she tell him what she told his wife. At first she acts innocent, but then she taunts and teases him, which angers him even more, and he throws her to the ground. They stare angrily at each other, but it quickly turns to excitement. The two have rough sex again. When Carlson pulls out handcuffs, it angers Delaney.  He cuffs her hands to her bed post and roughly initiates sex with her, though she enjoys it.  Carlson is shown in court to have had previous sexual relationships with a number of older rich men, including Jeffery Roston, in which her lovemaking was just as rough.  Roston says that she abruptly ended their relationship when he got heart surgery and became healthier.  Carlson's testimony convinces the jury, which acquits her. Before leaving court, she mockingly thanks her attorney for getting a guilty client off, fully aware that he cannot repeat what she said and that she can not be tried twice for the same crime.  That night, Dulaney visits Carlson's home, where he finds her with Marsh's doctor, Alan Payley, freely discussing the way they conspired to kill Marsh. She taunts Payley by telling him to lie low, as he could be convicted of [[perjury]], and tells him to leave because she has already forgotten him. Carlson bluntly tells Dulaney that her sexual prowess is how she is able to make men do anything. An enraged Payley lashes out at Carlson physically and, after Dulaney pulls him off, Payley shoots her twice. She plunges from a window to her death.

Brainsmasher... A Love Story
 Ed Malloy, a tough bouncer from [[Portland, Oregon]], is dragged into a twisted web of lies, magic and kung fu.  Samantha Crain is a glamorous [[supermodel]] who has everything -- except for true love.  Her sister Cammy is an "[[Indiana Jones]]" styled botanist in search of a very rare lotus flower.  Meanwhile, a group of Chinese monks with high-flying martial arts powers are in search of the lotus as well, because they believe that whomever eats its petals will gain infinite powers. (They also indignantly protest, "We are NOT ninjas!" when anyone mischaracterizes them.)  Samantha receives a package from her sister, who is trying to escape back to America, with the Chinese monks hot on her tail.  The package is the rare lotus flower.  It's arranged for the Crain sisters to meet in Portland.  But the monks intervene, and the Crain sisters flee separately.  While racing through the streets of Portland, Samantha seeks refuge in a bar that employs Ed Malloy ([[Andrew Dice Clay]]), who is notoriously nicknamed "The Brainsmasher."  Malloy sees the monks and decides to help Samantha.  While on the chase from the monks (and occasionally, Malloy's mother), the two fall in love.  Desperate, the monks capture Malloy and hold him for ransom: His life for the lotus.  The Crain sisters agree, but then double-cross the monks, and Malloy saves the day by living up to his "Brainsmasher" moniker.  
Broken (1993 film)
  The film begins with a scene of a person being executed by [[hanging]]. The trap door opens and the person drops with a maniacal smile on his face.  The movie then cuts to footage of an amateur video, taken from inside a car going through various parts of a city (the backwards "n" from the Broken album cover and the title "broken" is shown superimposed as a glass overlay). The car goes from the middle-class suburbs to, literally, the other side of the tracks, into a shoddy industrial area, with a brief shot of a "Meat District" sign. The car approaches a young man on the sidewalk. Almost immediately, the young man is suddenly in a basement, tied with a seat belt to a chair and [[Gag (BDSM)#Cleave|cleave gagged]], while being forced to watch a television. The first video, "Pinion," begins to play.  ==="Pinion"=== The music video for "Pinion" begins in a bathroom. The camera zooms in on a toilet flushing, and a network of pipes is shown leading to a contraption with a large gear system and a [[pressure gauge]] on it. As the camera zooms out, a tight, plastic [[bodybag]]-like suit suspended in a [[padded cell]] with six rods by the side is shown, with the end of the pipes attached to the mouth portion with water gushing in, presumably to drown the person inside. An alternative interpretation that the person bound inside is being fed the "waste of the world" coming through the pipes.<ref name="pinion">[http://www.arkmay.com/closure/pinion.html new sweat to drown me in: pinion]</ref>  ==="Wish"=== Cutting back to the amateur video, the killer, wearing some sort of leather mask, drags the victim's head back and forces him to drink some sort of liquid from a [[jerrycan]]. The middle of the video for "Wish" is interrupted by amateur footage again with the victim chained to a table with a large wad of dark substance on his face. As the killer is immediately followed to be seen putting his pants on, it could be assumed that it is [[feces]]. After the video ends, the killer repeatedly rewinds to the part of the video where Reznor screams "fist fuck!" and begins to rub his fist.  ==="Help Me, I Am in Hell"=== The video for "Help Me, I Am in Hell" shows a middle-age bald man in a room filled with flies. He ignores them while eating some sort of steak and drinking wine. On one occasion, it is clearly shown that flies also enter his mouth when he eats. The video cuts away several times to show the same man in bondage gear.  This video was blacked out in the most prominent leak;<ref name="help">[http://www.arkmay.com/closure/help.html new sweat to drown me in: help me i'm in hell]</ref> it is now generally believed (although not definitively proven) that this sequence is part of the complete film but was blacked out by Reznor in the bootlegged copy. Reznor is rumored to have distributed copies of ''Broken'' to his friends, each with a different part of the video blacked out, so that, if it were bootlegged, he would be able to [[canary trap|identify the source of the leak]].  ==="Happiness in Slavery"=== [[Image:HappinessSlaveryVideo.JPG|220px|right|thumbnail|The final scene of "Happiness in Slavery". The torture machine can be seen in the center, with [[Trent Reznor]] near the far wall]] Following the video, the victim is shown still tied to a table as the killer proceeds to rip his teeth out. The video for "[[Happiness in Slavery]]", which was [[banned]] by [[music video]] channels worldwide, shows up.<ref>[http://www.arkmay.com/closure/his.html new sweat to drown me in: happiness in slavery]</ref> It features a man (played by performance artist [[Bob Flanagan]]) stripping off his clothes and settling down on a machine that tortures, rapes and later kills him.  ==="Gave Up"=== The film ends with a video for "Gave Up"; this is different from the one on ''[[Closure (Nine Inch Nails VHS)|Closure]]'', as it is not an actual Nine Inch Nails video, but the music of NIN dubbed over the storyline of the movie. At this point, the victim is suspended from the ceiling and is repeatedly attacked by the perpetrator first with a blade, then a blowtorch, after which the killer slices off the victim's penis with a [[straight razor]]. The camera-work here closely resembles that of an amateur [[snuff film]], while there is interspersed footage of the police searching through the basement, and finding remains of previous victims. (At one point, a sign saying "TRESPASSERS WILL BE EATEN" is shown.) Finally, the film cuts back to the victim strapped on a table, as the murderer hacks his limbs off with a chainsaw, proceeds to presumably rape him, and finally slices his chest open to eat his heart.  The movie then cuts back to the execution scene, showing as the killer is dropped through the trap door, with a crazed smile on his face, falling through a seemingly immensely long tunnel, until the rope suddenly tightens. The movie ends with the inverted version of the Broken album cover, with the background black, and a mirrored "n" character filled with the original orange background texture. The severed head of the killer flying across the screen is also shown after 30 seconds of no audio and a black screen.  In versions of the tape labeled as "Techno-necrophilia", the movie is followed by a segment of [[Robert "Budd" Dwyer]]'s televised suicide. It does not appear on the "leaked" DVD version; it is possible that it was merely added by a third party while the tape was circulating.  
A Bronx Tale
 In 1960, Lorenzo Anello lives in [[Belmont, Bronx|Belmont]], an Italian-American neighborhood in [[The Bronx]], with his wife Rosina and his 9-year old young son Calogero, who is fascinated by the local mobsters led by Sonny LoSpecchio. One day, Calogero witnesses a murder committed by Sonny in defense of an assaulted friend in his neighborhood. When Calogero chooses to keep quiet when questioned by [[NYPD]] detectives, Sonny takes a liking to him and gives him the nickname "C". Sonny's men offer Lorenzo a better paying job, but Lorenzo, preferring a law-abiding life as an [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] bus driver, politely declines. Sonny befriends Calogero and introduces him to his crew. Calogero earns tips amounting to $600 working in the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] bar and throwing dice, and is admonished harshly by Lorenzo when he discovers it. Lorenzo speaks severely to Sonny, returns the money, and angrily warns him to keep away from Calogero.  Eight years later, Calogero has grown into a young man who has been visiting Sonny regularly without his father's knowledge. Calogero is also part of a gang of local Italian-American boys, which concerns Sonny, who warns Calogero to keep away from them and focus more on his schoolwork. Later on, Calogero meets an [[African American]] girl, Jane Williams, and is smitten with her. Despite the high level of racial tension and dislike between Italian Americans and African Americans, Calogero arranges a date with Jane. He asks for advice from both his father and Sonny, with the latter lending Calogero his car so he can make a good impression. Later, Calogero's friends beat up some African American cyclists who ride through their neighborhood, despite Calogero's attempts to defend them. One of the cyclists turns out to be Jane's brother, Willie. Willie mistakes Calogero for one of the assailants and accuses him of beating him up when Calogero and Jane meet for their date. Calogero loses his temper over the accusation and Willie's lack of gratitude, responding by accidentally addressing him with a racial slur, which he instantly regrets. Jane, disappointed, leaves with Willie.  At home, Calogero is confronted by his father who just saw him driving Sonny's car. An argument ensues and Calogero storms out. Shortly thereafter, Calogero is confronted by Sonny and his crew, who found a bomb in Sonny's car and suspected Calogero of planning to assassinate him. Calogero tearfully proclaims how he has come to view Sonny as a father and would never hurt him, and Sonny recognizes Calogero's innocence and allows him to leave. Lorenzo emerges to defend his son and confront Sonny, but is held back by Sonny's men. The African American boys egg the Italian-American boys' usual spot in retaliation for the previous beating, and Calogero's friends make a plan to strike back using [[Molotov cocktail]]s. They pick up Calogero in their car and try to force him to participate, but Sonny stops the car and orders Calogero out, warning them to stay away from Calogero. Calogero catches up with Jane, who tells him that Willie had since admitted that Calogero had tried to help him from the other boys who beat him up. Jane and Calogero make amends, but Calogero suddenly remembers his friends' plans to attack Jane's neighborhood and the two rush to stop them. During the attack, one of the Molotov cocktails is thrown back into the car window, igniting the remaining bottles. The resulting crash and explosion kills everyone inside. Calogero and Jane arrive to find Calogero's friends dead, and Calogero realizes that Sonny had saved his life.  Calogero rushes back to his neighborhood and makes his way through the crowded bar to thank Sonny and inform him of what happened, but an unnamed assailant shoots Sonny in the back of the head before Calogero can warn him. Calogero later learns that the assailant was the son of the man Sonny killed in front of Calogero's house eight years earlier. At Sonny's funeral, countless people come to pay their respects. When the crowd disperses, a lone man, Carmine, visits the funeral, claiming that Sonny once saved his life as well. Calogero does not recognize Carmine until he sees a scar on his forehead and realizes he was the assaulted man whom Sonny had defended eight years ago. Carmine tells Calogero that he will be taking care of the neighborhood for the time being, and promises Calogero help should he ever need anything. Carmine leaves just as Calogero's father unexpectedly arrives to pay his respects to Sonny, thanking him for saving his son's life and admitting that he had never hated Sonny, but merely resented him for making Calogero grow up so quickly. Calogero makes peace with his father, and the two walk home together as Calogero narrates the lessons he learned from his two mentors.  
The Bride with White Hair
 Zhuo Yihang was raised by Taoist Ziyang of the [[Wudang Sect]] and groomed to become a young chivalrous swordsman. He is placed in command of a coalition army formed by the eight major orthodox martial arts sects, which aim to prevent an evil cult from infiltrating China. During a battle against the cult, Zhuo Yihang meets a young woman called Lian Nichang and falls in love with her. She is an orphan and was raised by wolves as an infant before being adopted by Ji Wushuang, the [[Conjoined twins]] who lead the cult. After consummating their romance, Lian Nichang decides to leave the cult and follow Zhuo Yihang in pursuit of an ordinary life away from the ''[[jianghu]]'' (martial artists' community).  Lian Nichang succeeds in leaving the cult after suffering great pains. Meanwhile, Zhuo Yihang returns to Wudang and is horrified to see that his fellows have been murdered. The coalition believes that Lian Nichang is responsible and attack her when she arrives to meet Zhuo Yihang. Zhuo Yihang is forced to turn against Lian Nichang. Devastated by her lover's rejection, Lian morphs into a vicious white-haired killer and slays all the coalition members present. Suddenly, Ji Wushuang appears and reveals that he/she is actually the one who killed the Wudang members. Zhuo Yihang and Lian Nichang combine efforts to defeat and kill Ji Wushuang. However, even after the victory, Lian Nichang vows never to forgive Zhuo Yihang for betraying her and walks away while Zhuo looks on helplessly. In a brief epilogue set years later, Zhuo is alone in a remote mountain region guarding a rare flower that is said to bloom only once every several decades and has the ability to reverse the effects of ageing (turning white hair back to dark). Believing that it can cure the harm he has inflicted on Lian Nichang, he awaits for the return of his loved one and hopes that she will show up.  
The Bride with White Hair 2
 Lian Nichang felt betrayed by her lover, Zhuo Yihang, and has since morphed into the vicious "White-Haired Witch". She starts a cult which accepts women who were exploited by men. Its members include [[Chen Yuanyuan]], who was betrayed by [[Wu Sangui]]. Meanwhile, Zhuo Yihang awaits on a snow-capped mountain for a rare flower to bloom, as he believes that it can turn Lian Nichang's hair black again. Lian Nichang vows to kill the surviving members of the eight major martial arts sects, who view her as their sworn enemy after she killed their seniors.  Feng Junjie, heir to the [[Wudang Sect]]'s leadership position, marries Yu Qin, with the elders of the other sects as their witnesses. On the wedding night, Lian Nichang appears and kidnaps Yu Qin, leaving behind a trail of destruction and corpses. Feng Junjie survives the massacre and plans with the survivors to infiltrate the Witch's base and rescue his wife. Meanwhile, Lian Nichang brainwashes Yu Qin through a series of rituals and makes her see her husband and the eight sects as foes.  Feng Junjie and his companions confront the Witch and her followers in a battle but are defeated and only Feng and his friend are left of the group. They travel to the mountain in search of Zhuo Yihang, the only person who can stop the Witch from continuing with her brutal massacres. After enduring hardship, they did not find Zhuo Yihang and decide to return to the Witch's base in a final attempt to save Yu Qin. Feng Junjie is no match for Lian Nichang and is almost killed by her when Zhuo Yihang suddenly appears and stops her.  Lian Nichang uses her hair to pierce through Zhuo Yihang's body, critically wounding him, but she refrains from killing him as her hatred towards him gradually subsides. Just then, Chen Yuanyuan stabs Lian Nichang for betraying the cult's founding principles, causing Lian to pull her hair out from Zhuo Yihang's body, but Lian kills Chen as well. The film ends with the deaths of Zhuo Yihang and Lian Nichang, who finally forget their past feud and are laid to rest together as lovers. On the other hand, Feng Junjie is reunited with his wife, who has recovered from her trance.

Broken Promises: Taking Emily Back
 Ever since Pam Cheney ([[Cheryl Ladd]]) lost her baby during labor, she has been struggling with depression. She is not only supported by her loving, but hard working husband Sean ([[Robert Desiderio]]), but also by her friends Ella ([[Polly Draper]]) and Terry Sabin (D. David Morin), who have also lost a baby at age three. One year after labor, Pam decides to finally take a proposal to adopt a toddler. Going through official agencies proves unsuccessful, partly due to Pam's age, partly due to the growing demand of adoption. She is advised to take care of an orphaned teenager instead, but Sean refuses this option.  Instead, she meets a lawyer she knows nothing about, and, without going through legal business, pays him a large sum of money to meet with a homeless couple, Gary ([[Ted Levine]]) and Lily Ward ([[Kathleen Wilhoite]]), who are selling their daughter Emily (Amanda and Megan Braun). Even though Sean has severe doubts about the lawyer and the morality of this kind of adoption, he allows his wife to meet with the couple. During this, it immediately becomes clear to Pam that Ella is unwilling to give up Emily, though Ella insists that she wants the best for her daughter. At the end of the conversation, Gary allows Pam and Sean to adopt their kid.  Pam is delighted and soon grows used to raising a child. Trouble starts when Gary and Lily, having recently been thrown out of their shelter, demand to take back Emily, pointing out that the contract allows them to change their minds for the first thirty days after the adoption. Pam is desperate to prevent this, and grants Gary his one wish: she buys him a car, even though the contract forbids her to support Gary and Lily financially. Hoping that this has changed Gary's mind, she keeps the deal a secret from her husband. However, when Gary returns, demanding for more, Sean feels that his doubts are confirmed: Gary and Lily are con artists. He wants to give up Emily before he and Pam get involved too much emotionally, but it proves too late: Pam is unwilling to leave Emily.  Alternatively, she recognizes Gary as the source of all trouble and persuades Lily to leave him. Though Gary is able to seduce Lily - now pregnant again - back, he agrees on leaving alone the Cheneys and Emily. Meanwhile, Ella, who accompanied Pam to the shelter where she met with Lily and became moved by a poor orphan, convinces Terry to give parenthood another chance. They meet with an attorney to legally adopt Lily's unborn child. Lily commits to the deal, but later finds out that Gary has granted the adoption to another couple outside the law. Realizing that her husband is no good, she leaves him to be beaten by another man.  Sometime later, Lily gives birth to a baby boy. Gary shows up at the hospital with a new lawyer to claim Emily and the boy. Lily, however, convinces him that they are bad parents and should be brought up by the Cheneys and Sabins. In the end, Gary leaves the hospital, leaving his children behind with the adoptive parents.

Calendar Girl (1993 film)
 While Marilyn Monroe is enjoying her rise to stardom and iconic pop culture status, three childhood friends are happy enough to sneakily obtain racy pictures of her for their pubescent enjoyment. Once they mature (at least by age), Roy has his eyes set on joining the Military despite his strained relationship with his father. His buddy, Scott, has a prosthetic leg and is to be married soon to his darling significant other Becky, and his other pal, Ned, known affectionately as "Bleuer", works at a small town store and isn't initially as anxious to partake on this crazed notion as his friends.  Thanks to Roy's Uncle, the three desirous and hapless friends shack up at his place out in California where they yearn to meet—if only for a brief second—the fabulous and stunning Miss Marilyn Monroe. Their quest leads to shenanigans and silliness ensues as they arrange the most brainless ideas to win over their idol. One includes corralling a "sad" cow to moo outside of Miss Monroe's luxurious residence, another has the guys speeding after Marilyn towards a nude beach and an entirely separate subplot has them dodging some bad guys that are after Roy.  Eventually, however, it is up to Marilyn to pity the trio's collectively desperate agony. The boys devise a clever scheme to avoid Miss Monroe's hawkish maid and Roy slips in the question, to which Marilyn refuses a date. This leads to further despair amongst the trio. They begin to regret coming out for the trip and they decide to go out on the town one last time.  Surprisingly, in a sudden twist, Monroe finally does agree to a date upon the sandy splendor of the Californian beach. Initially, while animosity has grown between the three friends, Roy is designated to be the lucky one that gets to hopefully "canoe" Miss Monroe, but nonchalantly, he passes off the opportunity to his buddy "Bleuer" who surprisedly agrees and treats the lovely Miss Monroe to a wonderful platonic night.  While Roy (in his macho way) is disappointed by Bleuer's effort, the boys return home to the sad news that Marilyn has abruptly died of a drug overdose. Back home, Scott continues his plans to marry his love, Becky, and Roy tussles with his father in the gym which leads to one last touching moment between the two before Roy is shipped out to boot camp. The last image seen is of Bleuer as he embraces his wild side and partakes in a wild telephone booth gathering that woos a local college girl in his favor.  
Butterfly and Sword
 Butterfly has nothing to do with the martial arts world. Her father was once a renowned member of the martial arts world, but she is just another young girl deeply in love with Meng Sing Wan. They live happily in a small hut next to a river, where he spends time trying to catch fish, and writing poetry. From time to time, Sing has to go away on business to earn money, that's what he tells her anyway, but the horrifying truth is that he is an assassin.   He is a member of the Happy Forest, a group of assassins led by Sister Ko, but he is tired of the never-ending life of killing for a living. Yip is another member of the group, and is Sing's best friend. The both of them, along with Sister Ko, and a girl called Ho Ching grew up together, forming the best of Happy Forest. Yip is in love with Sister Ko, but is afraid to tell her. However, Ko only has eyes for Sing, but Sing regards her only as an older sister.   Ko is given a mission by the Grand Eunuch Tsao, who instructs her to steal a letter from the hands of Master Suen from the Elites Villa sect, who was given to him by Grand Eunuch Li, Tsao's adversary in court. Ko tells Sing to fake his own death, then enter Suen's service as a lone swordsman. Sing does this and more. He impresses Suen with his skills and soon has his trust. At this time however, he encounters Suen's girl, who looks remarkably like the Ho Ching that once disappeared many years ago. Suen sees Sing's interest in his woman, and so, gives her to him.   But on the night of the wedding, Ho Ching tries to steal the message, but fail and dies. Sing is devastated by her death, and he goes back to Happy Forest, confronting Ko as to why he wasn't told that Ho Ching was alive all this time, and was being an undercover. Ko is upset by Sing's outburst, only wanting what is best for all of them. Ko and Yip forces into Suen's Elites Villa, and with Sing already inside, they are able to defeat Suen and take the message. When Ko and Sing deliver the message to Eunuch Tsao, it is revealed that Eunuch Li is really Eunuch Tsao, and that he hatched up the plan to destroy the people of the martial arts world. In the end, Tsao is defeated by the teamwork of Ko, Sing, and a young prince.

Cannibal! The Musical
 The film begins with a [[Historical reenactment|reenactment]] of the gruesome events of [[cannibalism]] as described by the prosecuting attorney during Alferd Packer's trial in 1883. Packer insists that things happened differently than what has been recounted, and begins to tell his story to journalist [[Polly Pry]] through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] ("Shpadoinkle").  In 1873, a group of miners in [[Bingham Canyon, Utah]] hear of new gold discoveries in [[Breckenridge, Colorado|Breckenridge]] and decide to travel to [[Colorado Territory]] to stake a claim. After the original guide, Lucky Larry, dies from a lightning strike, Packer is nominated as the replacement since he claimed knowledge of the area ("Shpadoinkle [Reprise]"). He and his trusty horse, Liane, set off on what Packer estimates will be a three-week journey with a party of five miners: Shannon Wilson Bell, an aspiring [[Mormon]] priest; James Humphrey, who was forced by his father to join the party; Frank Miller, a cynical [[butcher]] who reluctantly joins their party at the mine; George Noon, a teenager hoping to meet women in Breckenridge; and Israel Swan, an [[Optimism|optimist]].  Four weeks later, while attempting to visit [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] for supplies they become convinced they are lost. An attempt to ask a local for directions to Provo proves unsuccessful, with the local warning them of impending doom awaiting them in the mountains. Finally arriving at a frontier post in Provo, they run into a group of three fur trappers bound for [[Saguache, Colorado|Saguache]]; O.D. Loutzenheiser, Preston Nutter, and their diminutive leader, Jean "Frenchy" Cabazon. The trappers despise the miners, whom they contemptuously call "diggers", yet seem to like Packer’s horse, telling Packer that she's a "trapper horse". Making camp, Packer and company reveal their goals for traveling to each other in song ("That's All I'm Asking For"). The next day, Packer wakes up to discover his horse and friend, Liane, is missing. After Bell wounds his leg in a [[Trapping#Leg-hold_traps|bear trap]], the men attempt to cross the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] near the Utah border. The group asks Packer if there are any other big rivers that they will have to cross to which he replies, “Oh no, just the [[Colorado River]].” They camp out for the night after their crossing, with Packer singing a heartfelt song about Liane ("Ode to Liane"). Eventually, after a disastrous crossing of the Colorado River the Packer party is spotted by two “[[Nihonjin]]” Indians (obviously played by Japanese actors and speaking Japanese). They are taken back to the tribe's encampment near [[Delta, Colorado|Delta]] where the chief warns them of a winter storm, allowing them to wait it out with the tribe. Packer's party also find the trappers camping out with the tribe, who proceed to brag about their lives in song before a small altercation breaks out over Liane, whose feedbag Packer finds in their possession ("Trapper Song").  The story returns to the present time, where Packer is sentenced to death by hanging, with his execution to occur in [[Lake City, Colorado|Lake City]]. That night, alone, Polly muses over the case and Packer's testimony, and she reveals her growing affection for him through song ("This Side of Me"). The next day, Polly visits Packer once again in prison, where he continues his story.  The men set out in the wilderness after Packer learns the trappers have already left, persuading them to leave under the guise of there being a break in the storm. The group begins to suspect that Packer is really only interested in following the trappers to find his horse. They soldier on until they encounter a foreboding "[[Cyclops]]", a tall man with a wounded eye, while unwittingly trying to steal one of his sheep for sustenance. The Cyclops recalls how a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldier shot out his eye in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and becomes enraged when he realizes Packer's men are not “[[Confederate States of America|Southern boys]]” after they can not finish the lyrics to "[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]", causing them to flee. They escape and the badly [[Frostbite|frostbitten]] Swan tries to cheer everybody up with a song about building a [[snowman]] ("Let's Build a Snowman"). They soon run out of food, resorting to eating their shoes as they become lost in the snow-covered [[Rocky Mountains]]. Out of frustration, Bell shoots Swan in the head because he does not appreciate his (Swan's) [[Pollyanna]]-esque perspective on their predicament ("Let's Build a Snowman [Reprise]"). The men discuss their dire situation that night over the fire, speaking of the [[cannibalism]] that the [[Donner Party]] had to resort to in California. They decide to consume the body of their dead companion (but “not the butt”) as Miller cuts up Swan's body, and only Bell refuses to partake in the cannibalism. Packer then has a [[ballet|ballet-inspired]] nightmare involving himself, Liane, and Cabazon. A few more days leads to talk of sacrificing one of their own. Packer convinces them for one more chance for a scouting trip, but when he returns, Bell has killed the others, claiming they planned to kill and eat him after Packer left. Packer is forced to kill Bell after threatening to turn him in, realizing he has gone insane. He is then forced to cannibalize the others to wait out the rest of the winter.  Arriving in Saguache sometime later, Packer finds Liane, who has taken to Cabazon, upsetting Packer. The sheriff of Saguache, suspicious of Packer arriving without the rest of his party, eventually finds out the fate of the other members and attempts to arrest Packer for cannibalism at a saloon. A bar-fight between Packer and the trappers (and some of the bar patrons, including the Cyclops from earlier) occurs, which Packer wins after brutally attacking Cabazon's groin using fighting techniques he learned from the Nihonjin chief, leaving Cabazon incapacitated with a high-pitched voice. Following this, Packer attempts to flee to [[Wyoming]], only to later be arrested there and brought back to Colorado to await judgement. On the day of Packer's execution in Lake City, the town breaks into song, celebrating Packer's impending death ("Hang the Bastard"). However, he is saved at the last minute by Polly, who arrives on the scene with Liane. Polly reveals that Packer had gotten a [[stay of execution]] from the governor stating that he could not be convicted of a state crime since Colorado [[Ex post facto law|was not a state at the time of the incident]]. Meanwhile Cabazon, who wants revenge against Packer for their fight in Saguache, claims the townsfolk came to see bloodshed and tries to trigger the gallows. The Nihonjin chief saves Packer by cutting his rope with a [[katana]] before beheading Cabazon, satisfying the crowd's blood-lust. Packer, seeing that Polly brought back Liane, realizes he doesn't need her anymore and chooses Polly (much to the excitement of the chief, who takes off after Liane with his katana), and the two kiss, only to be frightened by a still-alive Bell ("Shpadoinkle [Finale]").  
Carlito's Way
 In 1975, after serving 5 years of a 30-year prison sentence, [[Carlito Brigante]] is freed on a legal technicality exploited by his close friend and lawyer, Dave Kleinfeld. Carlito vows to be through with his criminal activities but is persuaded to accompany his young cousin Guajiro to a drug deal held at a bar. Guajiro is betrayed and killed by his suppliers and Carlito is forced to shoot his way out. Later, Carlito takes Guajiro's $30,000 from the botched deal and uses it to buy into a nightclub owned by a gambling addict named Saso with the intention of saving $75,000 to retire to the Caribbean.  As nightclub co-owner, Carlito declines several offers for a business partnership with a hot-headed young gangster from the [[Bronx]] named Benny Blanco. Carlito also rekindles his romance with his former girlfriend Gail, a ballet dancer who moonlights as a stripper. Kleinfeld develops a love interest with Benny's girlfriend, Steffie, a waitress at the club. Benny's frustration with Carlito's constant rejections boils over and he confronts Carlito one night at his table. Carlito publicly humiliates Benny, who reacts by manhandling Steffie. Fueled by his now-extensive use of alcohol and [[cocaine]], Kleinfeld brazenly pulls out a gun and threatens to kill Benny, but Carlito intervenes. Despite being personally threatened by Benny himself, Carlito lets Benny go unharmed; a decision which alienates Carlito's bodyguard Pachanga.  Kleinfeld, who stole $1 million in payoff money from his Italian mob-boss client, Anthony Taglialucci, is coerced into providing his yacht to help Taglialucci break out of the [[Vernon C. Bain Correctional Center|Rikers Island prison barge]]. Kleinfeld begs for Carlito's assistance in the prison break, and Carlito reluctantly agrees. Under cover of night, Carlito, Kleinfeld, and Taglialucci's son, Frankie, sail to a floating buoy outside of the barge where Taglialucci is waiting. As they pull Taglialucci aboard, Kleinfeld kills him and Frankie and dumps their bodies in the [[East River]]. Carlito immediately severs his ties with Kleinfeld and decides to leave town with Gail. The next day, Kleinfeld barely survives a retaliatory assassination attempt at his office.  Carlito is apprehended by police and taken to the office of District Attorney Norwalk, where he is played a tape of Kleinfeld offering to testify to false criminal allegations against Carlito. Norwalk advises that he is aware that Carlito is an accomplice to the Taglialucci murders in an attempt to leverage him into betraying Kleinfeld, but Carlito refuses. Carlito visits Kleinfeld in the hospital, where Kleinfeld confesses to selling Carlito out. Having noticed a suspicious man dressed in a police uniform waiting in the lobby, Carlito deftly unloads Kleinfeld's revolver and parts ways with him. The man is Taglialucci's other son, Vinnie, seeking vengeance for his brother and father. Vinnie sneaks into Kleinfeld's room and executes him without incident because of Kleinfeld's empty gun.  Carlito buys train tickets to Miami for himself and Gail, now pregnant. When he stops by his club to get the stashed money, Carlito is met by a group of mobsters led by Vinnie. The Italians plan on killing Carlito, but he manages to slip out through a secret exit. The Italians pursue him throughout the city's subway system and into [[Grand Central Terminal]], where they engage in a gunfight. Carlito kills all of his pursuers except Vinnie, who is shot and killed by police. As Carlito runs to catch the train where Gail and Pachanga are waiting for him, he is ambushed by Benny, who shoots Carlito several times with a [[suppressor|silenced gun]]. Pachanga admits to Carlito that he is now working for Benny, only to be shot as well. Carlito hands a tearful Gail the money and tells her to escape with their unborn child and start a new life. As he is wheeled away on a gurney, Carlito stares at a billboard with a Caribbean beach and a picture of a woman. The billboard then comes to life in his mind, and the woman, who is Gail, starts dancing as Carlito dies.  
CB4
  Three young friends and aspiring [[rap]]pers, Albert, Euripides, and Otis want to make their big break. The trio have talent, but no marketable image. In order to get their name heard, they appeal to local crime [[Crime boss|kingpin]] and [[nightclub]] owner Gusto along with his sidekick and henchman 40 Dog to ask for a spot on the bill at his club, but during a failed meeting the police rush in and throw Gusto in jail.  Gusto believes that the trio set him up, swearing revenge when he is released from prison. While Gusto is locked up, Albert steals his criminal background and identity to become "MC Gusto", renaming Euripides and Otis as "Dead Mike" and "Stab Master Arson" respectively. Together they form the hardcore gangsta rap group CB4 (Cell Block 4) and successfully sign with Trustus Jones, a local music mogul. CB4 becomes the hottest band on the charts with controversial hits like "Sweat from My Balls" and "Straight Outta Locash", and their rise to fame is documented by an aspiring director and his cameraman. However, an ambitious politician seeks to shut them down for [[obscenity]] charges, and tensions between the group arise over one member's gold-digging groupie girlfriend Sissy and the strain of the charade takes its toll on Albert's family life and relationship with his wholesome girlfriend Daliha. To compound this, the real Gusto escapes from prison and sets out to get revenge by making Albert take part in a record store robbery, exposing his face to the CCTV cameras and then taking the tape as a tool for blackmail. The group breaks up and reunites after Trustus Jones's death at the hands of Gusto. Eventually, the group set up their own sting operation with Sissy to capture Gusto and he is sent to prison for life. Albert gives up the pretense of being a gangsta, emceeing under his real name, and the group embarks on a reunion tour.  
Carnosaur (film)
 In a small town in the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]], a mysterious plague befalls its citizens. Dr. Jane Tiptree, a scientist working for the Eunice Corporation, is secretly breeding a strain of extra large and fertile [[chickens]] by splicing their [[DNA]] with that of different animals. The sponsors of the corporation become suspicious of her research, but cannot legally interfere. One night during transportation of the chickens, a mysterious creature hatches from a chicken egg, kills the drivers and escapes into the night.  Doc Smith is an [[alcoholic]] [[security]] watchman protecting digging equipment from [[Environmental movement|environmental]] [[activist]]s, though he befriends one of them named Ann Thrush. Meanwhile, the creature, which turns out to be a mutant dinosaur, goes on a killing spree, killing two truck drivers and a group of teenagers. One of the dead teenagers was the daughter of Jesse Paloma, an employee for Tiptree. Afraid of the truth about her research being leaked, she lures Paloma into a laser-protected dinosaur pen, where a  full-grown mutant dinosaur in captivity consumes him.  Thrush and the other activists begin to protest by handcuffing themselves to the digging equipment. However, the rapidly growing mutant dinosaur appears and slaughters the activists while Thrush watches in horror. Doc finds Thrush in shock and brings her back to his trailer, where she is attacked by the dinosaur but survives. Doc locates a truck belonging to the Eunice Corporation. Pretending to be the dead driver, he talks to Tiptree on the radio and makes his way to her facility. Meanwhile, Sheriff Fowler discovers a dinosaur embryo in a carton of eggs and brings it into a lab to study.  Doc sneaks into Tiptree's lab and holds her at gunpoint, telling her to show him her experiments. She reveals that the infected chicken eggs are responsible for the town's mysterious illness, as they contain a lethal airborne virus that impregnates women with dinosaur embryos, which kill the host through a combination of fever and trauma after giving birth. The goal of this is to spread the virus around the world, driving the human race into [[extinction]] and allowing dinosaurs to rule the Earth once more. When news of the town's deaths reaches the Eunice sponsors, they trace it back to Tiptree. The government infiltrates the town and has it placed under [[quarantine]]. In order to sterilize the situation, all civilians, infected or not, are shot and killed on sight.  As the plague advances, a distraught Fowler wanders aimlessly into the streets after the implied brutal deaths of his daughter and wife by the virus. He encounters the rampaging dinosaur mutant outside of a puppy kennel where he fatally wounds and kills the creature, but not before being mortally wounded by its sickle claw. Back at the lab, Tiptree reveals a serum that can cure the illness. Doc steals it tries to escape, accidentally ending up in her dinosaur pen. Tiptree releases the full-grown carnosaur from its laser bounds and it chases Doc. He escapes and the carnosaur breaks out of the facility. Tiptree is revealed to be infected with the virus and dies as she gives birth to a dinosaur mutant.  Doc returns to Thrush, who has fallen ill to the virus. The carnosaur makes its way to the construction site where Doc battles the creature with a [[skidsteer]] and with the help of a dying Thrush, impaling and kills the dinosaur. Bringing Thrush back into the trailer, Doc injects her with the serum as she seemingly passes into a coma. However Doc is shot and killed by government soldiers, who then burn his and Thrush's bodies. Anticipating a new world order without females and an ongoing mutant plague, a military industrial complex envisions a male-dominated future and police state enforced by strict violence and propagated by artificial wombs.  
Caro diario
 The film consists of three autobiographical chapters (''capitoli'') of an open diary—that of [[film director]] and [[film producer]] Nanni Moretti.  ===Capitolo I: In vespa (On my Vespa)=== The first episode follows the director/protagonist riding a [[Vespa]] through the neighbourhoods of a summery and half-deserted [[Rome]]. Shots of landscape, architecture, and beautiful monuments accompany his thoughts, which range from critiques of [[Hollywood]] [[film|cinema]] (specifically the contemporary movie ''[[Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer]]''), to critiques of banalization of the Italian cinema, to a chance meeting with [[Jennifer Beals]], to [[sociology]] and [[urbanism]]. The episode ends at [[Ostia (town)|Ostia]], close to the place where [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] was killed.  ===Capitolo II: Isole (Islands)=== The second episode cuts to Moretti escaping from the frenzy of city life on a journey through the [[Aeolian Islands]]. Travelling by [[ferry]], his first stop is [[Lipari]] where he visits his friend Gerardo ([[Renato Carpentieri]]), a scholar studying [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' who had moved to the island eleven years earlier. He retires to study on the lost island where he can't even receive the television signal. But he is unable to find the tranquillity he desires, due to the number of tourists. So Nanni, accompanied by Gerardo, moves to [[Salina Island]]. The two are welcomed by a couple, friends of Gerardo, who seem incapable of managing the education of an extremely over-indulged child. (Indeed, the entire island seems to be under the rule of children.) Gerardo lets himself be influenced by the boy, who spends hours in front of the television, and discovers [[soap opera]]. Gradually Gerardo becomes entirely dependent upon the genre. Nanni, now even more exasperated, decides to move, still accompanied by Gerardo, to the island of [[Stromboli]], but even this choice proves unfortunate: the two now have to deal with a megalomaniac mayor who wants to involve them in the most odd projects. While visiting the volcano Gerardo becomes still more gripped by the ''soap operas'', to the point of asking American tourists what happens in the episodes of ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', which haven't been broadcast in Italy yet.  Disgruntled by the latest failure Nanni decides to move on the island of [[Alicudi]], the least civilized of all, lacking water and electricity. At last Nanni seems satisfied with the accommodation, but Gerardo is impelled to escape from the island as soon as he realizes he cannot follow his favourite soap opera there.  ===Capitolo III: Medici (Doctors)=== The final episode narrates the difficult diagnosis of a disease that affected Moretti in real life and has the symptoms of persistent itching and disturbing insomnia. Nanni goes through a load of doctors and specialists who, between superficiality and false knowledge, suggest the most bizarre diagnoses. His desperation is such that he also tries alternate treatments, like [[Acupuncture]]. After having tried them all, another doctor suggests an X-ray after noticing his developing cough. This X-ray reveals a mass on the lung which after a [[biopsy]] he is diagnosed as suffering from a malignant, but treatable [[lymphatic system]] [[tumour]]. The illness symptoms, which Nanni found in a medical encyclopedia, are those he declared to the "deaf" doctors. The episode concludes with a bitter and sarcastic toast ''alla salute!'' (), accompanied by a glass of water.  
The Cemetery Club
 Based on the play by Ivan Menchell, this comedy-drama concerns three friends, Doris ([[Olympia Dukakis]]), Lucille ([[Diane Ladd]]), and Esther ([[Ellen Burstyn]]). All three live in the same Jewish community in [[Pittsburgh]], are in their mid-to-late 50s, and have become widows within the past few years. Once a week, they gather to visit their husbands' graves and meet at a deli afterward to talk about their lives.   Doris remains fiercely devoted to her late husband and takes her responsibilities as a widow seriously. Lucille is eager to get her feet back in the waters of dating, partly as revenge against her late husband, who often cheated on her, and partly because she's very lonely by herself. Esther is also not used to being alone after 39 years of marriage, but she doesn't feel ready to start dating again, at least not until she meets Ben ([[Danny Aiello]]), a former cop turned cab driver who gradually but firmly eases his way into her life.   Doris is appalled when she discovers that Esther is dating again and loudly protests that she's being disrespectful to her late husband, while Lucille is more than a bit jealous that Esther snagged a good man before she could. All of which comes to fruition at the wedding of their friend Selma ([[Lainie Kazan]]).  [[Jerry Orbach]] and [[Lee Richardson (actor)|Lee Richardson]] appear in a brief prologue sequence.  
The Cement Garden (film)
 Jack is a narcissistic 15-year-old boy, helping his father, a smoker with a persistent cough, unload large bags of cement to resurface the garden path of their post-war era [[Prefabrication|prefab]] house. Despite being told to come straight home from school to help with the work the next day, Jack stops by the remains of a torn-down prefab to smoke a cigarette and read a pornographic magazine he has hidden there. When he comes home, he excuses himself to go to the toilet, where he proceeds to masturbate. His father collapses from a heart attack and dies.  A few months after the tragedy, Jack's mother and his siblings, 17-year-old Julie, 13-year-old Sue, and 6-year-old Tom, are still mourning. Jack has become apathetic to the feelings of his family, while also neglecting to bathe. Jack's mother is taken ill and becomes bedridden and frail, prompting Jack and Julie to take control of the household. Jack's selfishness soon leads to conflict between him and Julie. Jack attempts to remedy the tension between them by sneaking into her room.  Jack teases that she's alone and unprotected before he tickles her sides with bee-suit gloves until he accidentally causes her to have an orgasm. He attempts to cover this up from his siblings. Shortly after this, the family celebrates Jack's 16th birthday in their mother's bedroom. He is reluctant to contribute to the small party by singing, but when Julie does a handstand, Jack stares at her underwear, then shares an intimate moment with her by singing [[Greensleeves]].   Although the rest of the family assume they are having fun, Julie recognizes what he is doing, and plays along. This, along with another incident when Julie, while sunbathing in the garden, persuades Jack to rub sunscreen into her back, intensifies what was initially a small affection for her into an incestuous crush. Jack soon finds himself escorting Sue and Tom to and from school, and defending Tom from a school bully, while Julie takes up the cooking and cleaning duties.  One day, while Jack is cleaning up his mother's room, his mother informs him that her illness has become worse and that she will have to go to the hospital for a couple of months. She tells Jack and Julie not to tell anyone about her absence, or else they will be forced into foster care and their home will be torn down. She informs him that she has set up a savings account for them to take care of themselves for a while. Shortly afterwards, the mother dies at home of her illness.  Grief-stricken and with no one else to go to, the siblings spend a miserable night together consoling each other in their living room. Remembering their last promise to their mother, Jack and Julie secretly resolve to hide her body. That night, they take the remaining bags of cement that Jack's father had bought the day before he died, create a crude mixture of cement and entomb their mother's body in a cement sarcophagus.  As time passes following their mother's death, Jack slowly matures, although he stops bathing altogether. Sue becomes more introverted, distancing herself from her siblings and confiding only in her diary. Julie forms a relationship with a much older man named Derek, whom Jack starts to view with jealousy and hostility. Tom, meanwhile, takes up cross-dressing and attempts to remodel himself as a girl, something that irritates Jack but delights his sisters.   Eventually, Tom starts to behave like a baby, sleeping in Julie's room in a crib and drinking from a bottle. The mental states of the other siblings gradually declines as time passes with no adult supervision. Derek becomes interested in what they are hiding in their basement. After a smell emanating from the basement draws him downstairs, Jack steps in and lies that the cement block contains a dead dog, subtly referencing their mother in the process.  Jack falls asleep naked on his mother's bed. He wakes up to the sound of Tom crying. Jack goes into his Julie's room and joins Tom, who is also naked, in the crib. Tom tells Jack that Derek has told him that the cement block actually contains their mother. Jack realizes that Julie has told Derek the truth.  Jack tells Tom fairy tale stories to coax him back to sleep, and soon falls asleep himself. He is awoken by Julie, who is both delighted and amused at what she has seen. Julie sits Jack on her bed and explains to him that she and Derek are not physically intimate and that he is an immature adult who lives with his mother. As their conversation becomes more intimate, Julie undresses to join Jack in his nudity, before kissing him. The two cuddle on the bed, while contemplating the future now that too many people know their family's secret.   Jack predicts that they will be taken into foster care, and their house will be torn down like the other prefabs in the area, contemplating that "one day, someone will come rooting round. All they will find will be a few broken bricks in the long grass." Derek walks in and is horrified by what he sees. He demands to know how long "this" has been going on, and Julie simply replies, "ages and ages." Derek expresses disgust and horror at what the two have become, and storms off.   Unperturbed, Jack and Julie lie back down on the bed and converse further regarding whether what they did was right. Jack states that what they are doing "seems natural to me." Smiling, Julie responds "me too," and the two begin to have sex, as the sound of Derek smashing up the cement tomb containing their mother reverberates around the house. Jack and Julie are sleeping, while blue lights from a police car can be seen in the room.

Cool Runnings
 Derice Bannock, a top [[100 metres|100m]] runner, fails to qualify at the Olympic Trial for the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] when fellow runner Junior Bevil trips and falls, taking Derice and another runner, Yul Brenner, with him.  To compete in the Olympics, Derice and his best friend, Sanka Coffie, a champion push cart racer, seek out Irv Blitzer, an old friend of Derice's father Ben who tried to recruit sprinters to the bobsled team years ago. Irving is an American [[bobsled]] two time Gold Medalist at the [[1968 Winter Olympics]] who finished first in two events again during the [[1972 Winter Olympics]] but was disqualified from the latter for cheating and retired in disgrace to [[Jamaica]], where he leads an impoverished life as a [[bookie]]. Derice's persistence eventually convinces Irving to be their coach and return to the life he left behind. They eventually recruit Junior and Yul, though Yul is still upset over Junior's mistake at the Olympic Trial.  The four try to find various ways to earn money to get in the Olympics but no sponsor takes the idea seriously and their various enterprises, from singing on the street to arm wrestling, and holding a kissing booth, all fail. Junior comes through for them when he sells his car, which gets the team the money that they need. Later on in a hotel room, Junior reprimands Sanka for hurting Yul's feelings over his ambitions. Junior tells the team about his own father's struggle and [[Rags to riches|how he became rich with hard work]]. He encourages Yul not to give up on achieving all of his goals and the two begin to show a mutual respect for one another.  In Calgary, Irving manages to acquire an old practice sled, as the Jamaicans have never been in an actual bobsled. The Jamaicans are looked down upon by other countries, in particular the East German team whose arrogant leader, Josef, tells them to go home, resulting in a bar fight. At the hotel room, Derice and Irv reprimand Sanka, Yul, and Junior and remind them what is at stake for the team. The team resolves to view the contest more seriously, continuing to train and improve their technique. They qualify for the finals, but are subsequently disqualified due to a technicality which the Olympic committee trotted out as retribution for Irving's prior cheating scandal. A frustrated Irving storms the committee meeting and confronts his former coach from the 1972 Olympic Winter Games Kurt Hemphill, now a primary judge of the 1988 Olympic Winter Games. He takes responsibility for embarrassing his country with the scandal and implores the committee to punish him for his mistake, but not the Jamaican team. Irv reminds them that the Jamaicans deserve to represent their country by competing in the Winter Games as contenders. That night at their hotel, the team gets a phone call informing them that the committee has reversed its decision and allows the Jamaicans to compete once again.  The Jamaicans' first day on the track results in more embarrassment and a last place finish. Sanka identifies the problem as Derice trying to copy the Swiss team which he idolizes and convinces him that the best they can do is bobsled "Jamaican". Once the team develops their own style and tradition, the second day improves; the Jamaican team finishes with a fast time which puts them in eighth position. Derice asks Irving about why he decided to cheat despite his gold medals and prestige; Irving tells Derice, "A gold medal is a wonderful thing, but if you're not enough without it, you'll never be enough with it," and convinces him to think of himself as a champion even if he fails to win the gold.  For the first half of the final day's race it looks as though the team will push into medal contention, until tragedy strikes: due to the sled being old, it cannot handle the high speed and eventually one of the sled's blades comes loose, causing it to flip onto its side as it comes out of a turn, leaving the team meters short of the finish line. Determined to finish the race, the team lift the sled over their shoulders and walk across the finish line to rousing applause from spectators, including Josef, Hempill, and Junior's father. The team, at the end, feel accomplished enough to return in four years to the next winter Olympics. A brief epilogue states the team returned to Jamaica as heroes and upon their return to the [[1992 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] four years later, they were treated as equals.

This caused tension between Connie and Beldar, who strongly disapproves of Ronnie, with Beldar going so far as tearing the roof off Ronnie's car and threatening him after Ronnie tries to make love with Connie (an act that angers Connie greatly). Beldar is also preoccupied with winning a golfing trophy at his country club, while Prymaat becomes concerned about her attractiveness to Beldar due to one of Beldar's driving students making a pass at him.  Gorman and Eli track the Coneheads down to their home and pose as [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] to gain entry to the Conehead home.  During the conversation, Prymaat discovers their communication device to Remulak is beeping, and she promptly tells Beldar that he has a phone call from 'the Big Phone'. This cause Beldar to promptly eject Gorman and Eli from their home. Beldar then receives word that their rescue vessel is on its way.  At a costume party that night, Connie is told that they will be rescued soon. She disobeys her parents or "parental units" by returning home with Ronnie. Once there Connie consummates their relationship using her parents' "senso-rings". Beldar and Prymaat walk in on them, just as the INS shows up to take the Coneheads into custody. Their rescue vessel arrives just in time, and Gorman and Eli are taken aboard with Beldar, Prymaat, and Connie.  On Remulak, Beldar is welcomed home, presenting Highmaster Mintot with a variety of 'gifts' from earth, including Gorman and Eli as slaves.  Mintot is at first satisfied with what Beldar has accomplished during his time on Earth, until he notices that Beldar got his teeth capped (something Beldar had done from advice from Otto as a part of blending in). He accuses Beldar of treason and sentences him to fight the ferocious Garthok ("narful the Garthok"), much to Prymaat's distress.  After the Garthok easily and gruesomely kills others who were sentenced to fight it, Beldar uses his Earthly golfing skills to save himself, killing the creature. For his victory, he is then granted a request: Beldar wishes to return to Earth to oversee its conquest, taking Gorman back with him as a minion. Mintot agrees, and Eli is left behind, becoming the Highmaster's personal lackey, acclimating to his new role rather quickly. Beldar leaves for Earth with Prymaat, Connie, and Gorman in tow. He soon demonstrates that Connie's feelings are more important to him than planetary conquest by quickly faking an Earth attack. Beldar orders his invasion force to retreat and proceed to their secondary target in another part of the galaxy, while making it look like his spaceship has been destroyed by a superior weapon. For sparing his life, Gorman agrees to give the Coneheads [[United States Permanent Resident Card|Green Cards]] in exchange for Beldar proving he has a marketable talent no other American citizen possesses, to which Beldar confidently agrees.  Some time 2 years later, Ronnie arrives to take Connie to the prom. Beldar gives Ronnie 55 words of advice, and then uses a massive flash bulb arrangement on his home-built Polaroid camera to document the happy event. As Connie and a now-sunburned Ronnie depart, Beldar and Prymaat look at the oversized photo, saying, "Memories, we will enjoy them".  
Conflict of Interest (film)
 In Los Angeles, Mickey Flannery's wife Patty is killed in front of their young son, Jason. Seven years later, he returns to his job at the police department in homicide, working under Captain Garland. He has investigated a car ring deal, but the captain has no interest in it, because it has no connection to homicide. Mickey is in a relationship with Vera and looks forward to meeting with his son after years apart. Jason has grown up with his grandparents, and is not enthusiastic to reunite with his father. While joining him on lunch, Mickey is startled when he hears gunshots after two cars drive by. Car repair shop and heavy metal club owner Gideon and his muscled companion Casey are the killers, who shot Trasher in cold blood.  Jason catches the eye of Eve, a tough heavy metal girl who takes Jason to Gideon's heavy metal club, where she reveals herself to be his girlfriend, even though she in high school. After being introduced to Gideon and Casey, he goes home with Gloria, a club co-worker whom he has sex with. Back at home, he confronts his father with having abandoned him, though Mickey explains that he could not take care of him because he was mourning and became an alcoholic - without a job. Mickey is called to the job to investigate the death of Gloria. He finds a letter signed by Jason in her room, and realizes that his son is involved and hides this piece of evidence from his colleagues. He rushes to [[San Pedro High School]] to get an explanation from his son, but Gideon interrupts them, warning Mickey to leave "his friend" alone. Gideon then offers Jason a job as a sound engineer in his club, which Jason accepts. As Gideon drives off, Mickey recognizes his car as the same one that drove off after the killing of Trasher.  Mickey follows Gideon to his home and, after cuffing him, confronts him with the murder as well as warning him to stay away from his son. He is interrupted by his captain, who lashes out at Mickey for breaking the police rules by having visited Gideon on his own, and informs him that Gideon has an alibi for the night that Gloria was murdered. Gideon, in fact, has provided an alibi for every worker in the club, and sends Shannon to pleasure Jason, in order to distract him from thinking that he might look suspicious. Gideon notices that Eve does not like this, for she has become infatuated with Jason. Jason blacks out during sex with Shannon and later finds her shot to death. As Mickey arrives, Gideon shows him Shannon's body and informs him that his son is responsible. When a report is made of Shannon's death, the captain becomes suspicious and infuriated when he learns from Gideon that Mickey showed up at the scene of the crime only moments after her death, prompting him to think that Jason killed both women: Mickey is fired on the spot.  Jason remembers that Gideon shot Shannon and is trying to frame him. He convinces Eve that they should get out as soon as possible, but are stopped by Gideon's men. With the help from his old friend Ray Dureen and colleague Oakes, Mickey steps outside the book to prove that Gideon is framing his son. He suspects that Detective Falcone, who has been harassing Mickey whenever he exclaimed suspicion of Gideon, might have something to do with the entire ring, and decides to follow him. Falcone drives to Gideon's place at the dock, where he is planning on finishing off Jason and Eve. After rescuing them, Mickey is captured by one of Gideon's men. He witnesses Gideon using his gun to kill Falcone and then prepares to kill him, when Jason comes to the rescue. After killing Gideon in an explosion, Mickey finds out that Ray was involved with the car deal ring and Ray admits that he had Patty killed because she found out about his criminal activities. Mickey considers killing Ray, but, encouraged by Jason, turns him in to the police.

 Arriving in [[Seattle]], Washington, writer Nick Eliot (Cary Elwes) secures a job at ''Pique'' magazine and lodging in a guest house belonging to Cliff and Liv Forrester (Kurtwood Smith and Gwynyth Walsh). The handsome Nick soon makes the acquaintance of the Forrester's 14-year-old daughter Darian (Alicia Silverstone), a precocious girl who develops an intense attraction to him. She secretly helps Nick by sneaking into his room and rewriting one of his ''Pique'' stories, which subsequently wins a rave from his editor/boss, Michael (Matt Walker). At a party thrown by the Forresters, Nick agrees to accompany the lonely girl on a nighttime drive to a romantic spot, where she kisses him.  This intensifies Darian‘s crush on Nick, but he quickly wises up and attempts to put her off, having begun a budding romance with coworker Amy (Jennifer Rubin). Darian continues to boldly pursue him, even going so far as to undress in his view while he is hiding in her closet. Nick, however, continues to rebuff her advances, and Darian‘s actions become destructive. She defaces a car he's restored and erases his computer discs, yet he's unable to convince Cliff and Liv of what's going on. Cheyenne (Amber Benson), a friend of Darian who tries to warn Nick about her, meets with an "accident" at the riding school they attend together. After Darian spies on Nick in bed with Amy, she locks Amy in her darkroom and empties a wasps' nest into the vents. Amy survives, and Nick, now convinced that Darian is big trouble, attempts to find new lodging. However, Darian manages to sabotage his efforts. She accuses him of sexually assaulting her with "evidence" obtained from a used condom from Nick's trash, leading to his arrest. After Michael bails him out (and suspends him until trial), Nick is met once again by Cheyenne. She informs Nick that she knows he did not do anything to Darian, and that Darian had behaved like this before to a previous crush, a camp counselor named Rick who "accidentally" died by eating something poisonous. Cheyenne also informs Nick of a diary Darian kept that can exonerate him.  When Cheyenne leaves, Nick goes looking for her when he hears strange noises from the Forrester's house. He discovers Cheyenne bound and gagged in the attic, and is confronted by Darian and then an amazed Cliff, who attacks him thinking he is the enemy. Darian, while still infatuated, attacks her father, leaving Nick free to subdue her with one punch. Acquitted, Nick goes to live with Amy while Darian, confined to a psychiatric hospital, wishes to express her remorse for what she has done to Nick. Her doctor comments that she is making good progress, unaware she is developing a crush on him now.  Ultimately, she returns to her room in the psychiatric hospital, where she looks at her doctor's wedding photo with an evil glare.

Cronos (film)
 In the year 1536, an alchemist in Veracruz developed a mechanism that could give eternal life. In 1937, an old building collapsed and the alchemist, who has marble-white skin, is killed when his heart is pierced by the debris. Investigators never revealed what else was discovered in the building: basins filled with blood from a corpse.  In the present, an old, somewhat religious antique dealer, Jesús Gris, notices that the base of an archangel statue is hollow. He opens it and finds a 450-year-old mechanical object. After winding the ornate, golden, scarab-shaped device, it suddenly unfurls spider-like legs that grip him tightly, and inserts a needle into his skin which injects him with an unidentified solution.  A living insect — entombed within the device and meshed with the internal clockwork — produces the solution. It is explained that insects share many characteristics involving immortality and holy people including Jesus Christ. However, Gris is unaware of this detail until later. Eventually, he discovers that his health and vigor are returning in abundance, as is his youth. His skin loses its wrinkles, his hair thickens and his sexual appetite increases. However, he also develops a thirst for blood. This at first disgusts him, but he eventually succumbs to the temptation. He then uses the device later that night, but says his nightly-prayer as he does. His granddaughter Aurora notices this, and begins to worry about Gris.  Meanwhile, a rich, dying businessman, Dieter de la Guardia, who has been amassing information about the device for many years, has been searching for the archangel statue with the cronos device. He has appropriated several archangels already. He sends his thuggish American nephew Angel, who allows his uncle's abuse on a daily basis for an inheritance, to purchase the archangel at the antique shop.  During a party, Gris sees blood on a men's room floor and decides to lick it. Angel finds Gris and tries to beat him into giving up the device. When Gris faints, Angel places his body inside a car and pushes it off a cliff. Gris briefly awakens bleeding to death, and prays for survival. He unfortunately dies but later revives and escapes from an undertaker's establishment before he can be cremated. He later reads the program for his funeral and steps on a glass bottle shard. He pulls the shard out of his foot and uses it to open his mouth which had been sewn shut. He returns to his home where Aurora lets him in. Dieter beats Angel for not ensuring Gris's heart was destroyed, and sends him off to check on the body. Gris works on a letter to his wife in which he comments on the changes that his body has made and tells her that after completing some 'unfinished business' he will return to her. He notices that his skin burns in the presence of sunlight and sleeps in a box to avoid it.  Eventually, he and Aurora bring the device to Dieter's business headquarters, where the businessman offers him a "way out" in exchange for the device. Gris comments on his damaged skin and the businessman tells him to peel it off because he has new skin underneath, which is marble-white like the dead alchemist. Gris threatens to destroy the device, but is told that he will die should that happen. Gris agrees to hand it over in exchange for knowing the "way out", whereupon Dieter stabs him. Before being able to strike the killing blow to the chest, Dieter is incapacitated by Aurora. The mortally wounded Dieter is found and killed by Angel, who is tired of his abuse and waiting for his inheritance. Angel confronts Gris on the rooftop of the building and beats him severely. Gris throws them both off the roof, killing Angel.   Aurora finds Gris unconscious, and uses the device to wake him up. Upon awakening, Gris is tempted to feed off his granddaughter, when he notices her hand bleeding. Gris grabs Aurora with his mouth gapping open and a lifeless look in his eyes, which makes her fearfully say "grandfather". The thirst seems to be too much for Gris to handle, but he eventually backs off. He then painfully destroys the device, despite previous warnings. Surprised to still be alive, he believes [[God]] to have saved him because of his attempted self-sacrifice. He repeats his name to himself, and returns to his home. He lies in bed with Aurora and his wife by his side, awaiting for the rising sun to see if he is fully free of the effects from the device. However, the film fades to white and then the credits roll before this can be determined, leaving Gris's fate open for Guillermo Del Toro to make more money off of a sequel (his filming or someone else's).

He goes to buy a train ticket home but the last train is leaving at 6:25. Neil shows up at the Lighthouse Inn earlier than 6:30 to see Julie dancing to [[ABBA]]'s "[[Dancing Queen]] for some men. She stops when she sees him and angrily asks him what he's doing there. Neil tells him he doesn't need the money because of Nigel's card. Julie hesitantly asks what time his train is and he replies that he missed it because he wanted to see her. He shows her the dress and shoes he bought for her and takes her for a romantic dinner by the sea. They dance intimately while Julie tells him how more fun his wedding night is compared to hers.  The next day Julie sees Neil off. Neil goes back to Sophie and finds her angry with him, blaming Neil for the fiasco and disbelieving that Nigel, who had given some explanation to Sophie's family, was responsible for the stripper and Neil's disappearance. He realizes that he doesn't love her anyway and drives back to Scarborough, where he finds Julie dancing alone to "Dancing Queen" at the place where they had dined the previous night. They kiss through the glass windows after Neil tells her he's not married, and they drive off to Venice together,  
Dark at Noon
 Post World War I, the French doctor Felicien travels to a small town in Portugal to visit a factory his father invested his fortune in prior to his death. Upon his arrival to the town with fields of crutches protruding from the ground, Felicien finds the area to be a surreal dream world where visions and miracles are such ordinary occurrences they become a nuisance. The dogs of the town are sacred animals and the people of the town are the sleep walking undead. Felicien finds his way to a mansion where Anthony, the wealthy owner of the factory that produces prosthetic limbs, resides with his wife Ines. After sitting through a very bizarre dinner with the residents of the mansion Felicien has an equally strange dream involving the couple.  While exploring the town Felicien meets a priest buried in the ground by Ellis, an artist who uses corpses to make living paintings and who looks identical to one of Felicien’s psychiatric patients. The priest is exhausted by the endless miracles, as it is his job to excommunicate people for performing miracles not authorized by the church. Felicien continues to have strange encounters that blur the lines between illusion and the real, including conversations with [[Marquess|Le Marquis]], who inhabits the same body as Anthony, and the Virgin Mary who mimics and mocks Felicien when she appears before him. He also meets a young boy who performs miracles and helps Felicien out when he can’t find a bathroom and needs to urinate. One of Felicien’s more unusual encounters is with a giant sculpture of a finger made from marble that crashes through the ceiling of the guest room of the mansion, nearly crushing him.  Felicien explores Anthony’s mansion to find a basement laboratory where disturbing experiments are performed. Felicien learns that doubles of Anthony and Ines were created in the lab when their souls left their bodies one night. The couple’s souls wander and sometimes occupy the body of Le Marquis. Towards the end of the film Felicien visits the laboratory again and gets thrown out of the lab where he finds himself stuck levitating in the air against his will. The miracle performing boy attempts to help him get back on the ground, but must first get permission to perform the miracle. In the meantime the priest lassoes a rope around Felicien and leads him around. Eventually the miracle boy is able to help him down to the ground. Felicien rushes back to the laboratory when he hears Le Marquis is dying to wish him farewell. Felicien finally leaves the strange town, floating away as he walks towards the sky.

Dazed and Confused (film)
 It's May 28, 1976, the last day of school at Lee High School in the suburbs of [[Austin, Texas]]. The next year's group of seniors are preparing for the annual [[hazing]] of incoming freshmen. Randall "Pink" Floyd, the school's star football player, is asked to sign a pledge promising not to take drugs during the summer or do anything that would "jeopardize the goal of a championship season". When classes end, the incoming freshman boys are hunted down by the seniors and [[Paddling (punishment)|paddled]]. The incoming freshman girls are also hazed; they are rounded up in the school parking lot by senior girls, covered in mustard, ketchup, flour and raw eggs and forced to propose to senior boys.  Freshman Mitch Kramer escapes the initial hazing with his best friend Carl Burnett but is later cornered after a baseball game and violently paddled. Fred O'Bannion, a senior participating in the hazing tradition for a second year after failing to graduate, delights in punishing Mitch. Pink gives the injured Mitch a ride home and offers to take him [[cruising (driving)|cruising]] with friends that night. Plans for the evening are ruined when Kevin Pickford's parents discover his intention to host a keg party. Elsewhere, the intellectual trio of Cynthia Dunn, Tony Olson and Mike Newhouse decide to participate in the evening's festivities. Pink and his friend David Wooderson, a man in his early 20s who still socializes with high school students, pick up Mitch and head for the Emporium, a [[pool hall]] frequented by teenagers.  As the night progresses, students loiter around the Emporium, listen to [[rock music]], cruise the neighborhood and stop at the [[drive through|hamburger drive-in]]. Mitch is introduced to sophomore Julie Simms, with whom he shares a mutual attraction. While cruising again with Pink, Pickford and Don Dawson, Mitch drinks beer and smokes [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] for the first time. After a game of [[mailbox baseball]], a neighborhood resident brandishing a gun threatens to call the police. They barely escape after the resident fires at their car. After returning to the Emporium, Mitch runs into his middle school friends. They hatch a plan to get revenge on O'Bannion. It culminates with them dumping paint on O'Bannion, who leaves in a fit of rage.  After the Emporium closes, an impromptu keg party is planned in a field under a [[Moonlight tower#Moonlight towers in Austin, Texas|moonlight tower]]. Cynthia, Tony and Mike arrive at their first keg party, where Mike is threatened by tough guy Clint Bruno. Tony runs into freshman Sabrina Davis, whom he met earlier during the hazing and they begin hanging out together. Cynthia likes Wooderson and exchanges phone numbers with him. Mike, suffering from the humiliation of his confrontation with Clint, decides to make a stand, punches him and gets tackled. The fight is broken up by Pink and Wooderson. Football player Benny O'Donnell confronts Pink about his refusal to sign the pledge. Pink, the only player not to have signed, believes it violates his individuality and beliefs. Mitch leaves the keg party with Julie. They drive to a nearby hill overlooking town to [[making out|make out]]. Tony gives Sabrina a ride home and they kiss goodnight.  As night turns to dawn, Pink, Wooderson, Don, Ron Slater and several other friends decide to smoke marijuana on the 50-yard line of the football field. The police arrive so they ditch the drugs. Recognizing Pink, the police call Coach Conrad, his football coach. Conrad lectures Pink about hanging out with "losers" and insists that he sign the pledge. Pink says that he might play football but he is not going to sign it. Pink leaves with his friends to get tickets to an [[Aerosmith]] concert. Mitch arrives home after sunrise to find his mother has waited up for him. She decides against punishment but warns him about coming home late again. Mitch goes to his bedroom, puts on headphones and listens to "[[Slow Ride]]" by [[Foghat]] as Pink, Wooderson, Slater and Simone Kerr travel down a highway to purchase their tickets.  
Dave (film)
 Dave Kovic runs a temporary employment agency in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.]], and has a side job impersonating [[President of the United States|President]] Bill Mitchell. He is requested by Secret Service agent Duane Stevensen to make an appearance as the President at a hotel. Dave assumes it is a matter of security, but it is really to cover up Mitchell's extramarital affair with a [[White House]] staffer.  Mitchell suffers a severe stroke during the rendezvous, leaving him in a coma. [[White House Chief of Staff]] Bob Alexander and [[White House Communications Director|Communications Director]] Alan Reed convince Dave to continue impersonating the President, telling him that Vice President Gary Nance is mentally unbalanced. Only Bob, Alan, the Secret Service, and the medical staff know of the switch. First Lady Ellen Mitchell leads a separate life, rarely seeing the President.  The public is notified that Mitchell has had a "minor circulatory problem of the head". With Dave established as President, Bob and Alan send Nance on a 12-nation goodwill tour of Africa and implicate him in a savings and loan fraud. Once Nance is forced to resign, Bob plans for Dave to nominate him as Vice President, whereupon Mitchell will have a more serious stroke and Bob will ascend to the Presidency.  Dave's enthusiasm revives Mitchell's popularity. He visits a homeless shelter with Ellen, who does not understand why he has taken a sudden interest. Bob forges Mitchell's veto of a funding bill that includes the shelter. When Dave is confronted about the veto by Ellen, he confronts Bob, who offhandedly tells him that if he can cut $650 million from the federal budget he can keep the shelter. Dave has his accountant friend Murray Blum help him rewrite the budget so that the project may be reinstated. To make sure that Bob doesn't interfere, Dave does it publicly in front of the press.  Suspecting that he is not really her husband, Ellen tricks Dave into revealing the truth. Dave and Duane show her Bill on life support in the White House basement. She and Dave decide to leave the White House. However, after a night out, they realize all the good they could still do and decide to return.  The next morning, Dave blackmails Bob into resigning by threatening to reveal the switch to the public, then announces a plan to find a job for every American who wants work. A few days later, Nance returns from Africa and confronts Dave about the savings and loan scandal, insisting they both know there is no merit to the allegations. Dave talks to Alan, who reveals the whole plan was Bob's idea. Meanwhile, Bob reveals Mitchell's involvement in the savings and loan scandal while pushing his own candidacy for the presidency. Realizing that he cannot go into hiding, Dave decides to take responsibility for Mitchell's actions.  That night, Nance tells Dave that whatever happens to them because of the scandal, he finds the jobs program a wonderful idea. After spending some time with the Vice President, Dave tells Ellen that Nance is a good man and he would make a great president. Realizing what Dave has planned, Ellen tells him that she does not want to lose him. The next day in a joint session of Congress, Dave admits to Mitchell's role in the scandal, but introduces evidence proving Bob was the mastermind and Nance is innocent. Bob realizes that Alan has betrayed him as Dave clears Nance of the charges. After apologizing to Nance and the country, Dave fakes a stroke and makes a switch with the real Mitchell in an ambulance en route to the hospital. Nance becomes Acting President under the terms of the [[25th Amendment]] and is sworn in as President five months later when Mitchell dies. Bob and eight other members of the Mitchell Administration are indicted on 34 charges of law violations and obstruction of justice two days after Dave's jobs initiative passes.  Dave decides to run for city council and Ellen comes to the office to volunteer. As they embrace, Duane stands guard outside the office door.

David Copperfield (1993 film)
  The film starts with a female cat named [[Betsey Trotwood]] (voiced by [[Andrea Martin]]) impatiently making her way through the Christmas festive streets of Blunderstone with armfuls of gifts. She wants to see her niece and is quite abrasive, knocking people around when they get in her way. As she passes, the film's main villains, a leonine named [[Edward Murdstone]] (voiced by [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]]) and a fat rodent named Grimby (voiced by [[Richard Dumont]]), are seeking new "workers"—i.e. abducting orphans and urchins off the streets.  At the Copperfield estate, a feline doctor sees to the widow Clara's delivery. The chubby mole servant/attendant [[Peggotty]] brings several containers of hot water and assures that the delivery will go smoothly. David is brought into the world.  Betsey arrives with the belief that her sister gave birth to a daughter. When she finds out that her niece is actually a nephew, Aunt Betsey is furious and leaves in a huff.  Years later, on his fifteenth birthday, David (voiced by [[Julian Lennon]]) is quite happy with the gifts he has been given, including a [[harpsichord]] that had belonged to his late father, but not quite happy with his mother's insistence on being civil with Murdstone. When Murdstone arrives, he is rather rude, even to Clara's face, but she gets upset by David's response to his attitude. Clara believes that he will be a good father figure for David and be able to provide for him. David, as well as everyone else, senses something horrible about him and refuses to regard Murdstone with any level of respect, much to his mother's worry. Despite David's protests, Clara marries Murdstone who repeatedly reassures her that it's for the best. In the meantime, he also harasses David and belittles him for having an imagination. His initial cruelty is best demonstrated when he nearly crushes David's little bird to death to demonstrate the cruelty of the real world.  When Clara is brought down by illness, Murdstone arranges for David to move with him to London where he'll work in his factory. David protests but is forced to go along, although he has a chance encounter with love interest Agnes Wickfield (voiced by [[Sheena Easton]]) when her father the Duke comes by Murdstone's factory. While Murdstone tries to keep the Duke from taking his factory (Murdstone has failed to pay the rent), David and Agnes become more properly acquainted, bonding over a love of literature. But David's brief moment of joy is cut short by the Duke and Murdstone's arrival (it turns out that they weren't around for rent-collecting but because Agnes was curious about the process of cheese-making). But before they leave, Agnes arranges for David and Murdstone to join them for tea the next Saturday. David agrees. Once Agnes and the Duke are gone, Murdstone cruelly throws David into the factory where he is beaten and tossed about by Murdstone's security force.  The next morning, David awakens in [[Mr Micawber]]'s house and is ushered in by a dog  named Mealy (voiced by [[Howie Mandel]]). They dissuade some angry Londoners demanding Micawber pay their debts by making a charade that Micawber left his wife and kids. The Micawbers are far more civil than Murdstone. Micawber brings food for the workers but the time comes for work.  Throughout the film, most of Murdstone's scenes consist of actions reaffirming his villainy, such as destroying Clara's letters to David and counting down the days until her death, and he delights in the prospect of breaking down David and robbing the Copperfield fortune.  Meanwhile, David hopes to escape from the factory though Mealy tells him of the various obstacles like the guards and a moat filled with alligators. He also speaks of the "Cheese Monster," a beastly vulture that circles the premises to catch runaways. With this in mind, David turns his focus to [[Robinson Crusoe]]–inspired methods of bettering the workplace, such as using a rope to lift a wooden ramp to ease transportation of giant cheese wheels. Despite increasing efficiency and production, Murdstone is angry. Wanting revenge, he has Grimby and the guards capture David and lock him and Mealy, who had been helping David escape, in a tower. David manages to kill the boredom by telling Mealy the tale of the Three Musketeers.  The next day, David and Mealy are ushered (or rather thrown to the streets) for an hour break before their next shift. While walking through London, they come across the angry Londoners wanting Micawber to repay their debts, which gets worse for them when a pig gets stuck in the chimney. Micawber appears just as the debtors leave frustrated. David and Mealy praise his act.  David finds out about Murdstone's mail tampering and asks if Micawber can get the next letter to Peggotty. Unfortunately, just as David and Mealy get ready for their next shift, Murdstone catches on and demands that the Micawbers treat David badly under the threat of using their infant children as workers.  Agnes, disguised in a beggar's cloak, makes her way towards Murdstone's factory and sees just how hellish life is down there. On the way, she sees David and Mealy running to make their next shift. Determined to see David again, she hides underneath Grimby’s carriage. While working the night shift, David gets a glimpse of the "Moldies" in a drainage grate. "Moldies" were one of Murdstone's experiments gone wrong that spread and trapped the workers in a mold-like slime.  David is nearly decapitated by a cheese guillotine by Murdstone due to sleepiness. Agnes appears and comes to David, believing him to be hurt. When he awakens, he's rather delighted to hear that Agnes cares. Unfortunately, Murdstone appears and forcefully ushers Agnes out. Making matters worse, the Duke is more concerned with how this might damage his reputation than listening to his daughter.  Back at the Copperfield estate, Peggotty cries over the death of Clara. An unknowing David becomes more determined to escape and is told by Mealy that he should "read the streets."  Murdstone loses his temper when he finds out that Clara made a new will, but then considers that he'll just have to get the will from Peggotty. Thus, he plots to have Peggotty come to them. Peggotty arrives and has Micawber hide Clara's will in his chimney while also giving David the bad news. Unfortunately, Murdstone has David and Mealy thrown in the Tower again when he can't find the will which has everything left to David. Fortunately, Mealy has a plan where he talks aloud as if Murdstone and Grimby have been fattening up the Cheese Monster so they can eat the vulture.  Grimby searches the Micawbers' domicile and threatens Peggotty and the Micawbers with Moldy exposure if they don't give up the will. Unfortunately, Murdstone and Grimby find the will and revel in David's seemingly broken state. Fortunately, Mealy and David set up their plot to escape, making a hollow cheese wheel to cover David. Agnes arrives to seek out David but is captured. Due to her unexpected appearance, David's escape via hollowed cheese wheel plan fails.  Mealy briefly fights off Grimby and Murdstone for a chance to get David over the gate. Agnes gets away from the crooked guards and readies her horse. Fortunately, the Cheese Monster gives David a chance to catch up to Agnes and the two leave while Murdstone and Grimby are caught underneath the Cheese Monster's girth. Unfortunately, Micawber and Mealy are tossed into the sewers where the Moldies lurk while Peggotty and Mrs. Micawber are kept under security.  David and Agnes express concern over David's plan to enlist Aunt Betsey's help by getting to Dover. Out in the sticks, the two try to figure out their location while Murdstone and Grimby try to figure out why David would be heading towards Dover. The derby-wearing bird David befriended earlier is seen imprisoned with a chain to a globe made out of cheese. He's set free when Grimby tosses a cleaver and cuts the chain. He flies away when the two villains leave and gives the news of the couple's leave to Dover to the Cheese Monster who knows a shortcut.  In the rural areas, Murdstone has Grimby search out the terrain like a scent-hound, and he finds a trail of Agnes' perfume. Later that night, Agnes is chased by a bunch of wild boars who trap her in a tree. David tries to find her among the thick trees.  The next morning, the derby-wearing bird finds David and alerts him to a way to Dover. David finds Agnes in the tree, and with some effort, pushes a boulder to ward off the boars. Unfortunately, the boulder knocks over the tree and Agnes' cries for help catch Murdstone's attention. The tree breaks further and Murdstone only makes it worse. Both Agnes and David let go and plummet down a waterfall. Murdstone and Grimby dance and chant "We did it! We did it!", soon gloating about David's apparent death to the workers back at the factory in front of a burning, blazing furnace.  Down the river, David and Agnes emerge from the water not far from Aunt Betsey's place. Her pet parrot, Mr. Polly, discovers David and Agnes worn out on the staircase. The derby-wearing bird gives Mr. Polly the word of Murdstone's actions. Aunt Betsey is glad to see David and agrees to help them with getting back at Murdstone and Grimby and freeing their slaves.  In the sewers, Mealy is despaired over the news of David's "death" though Micawber refuses to believe it until given proof. Unfortunately for them, the Moldies come back and they are next seen up to their necks in the purple cheese.  Murdstone and Grimby try to get the Duke to sign over complete control of the cheese factory. Before any official documentation can be made, Aunt Betsey comes in with a full-on police force to kick and arrest the guards.  Murdstone orders Grimby to get his "cheese gun" and starts firing cheese bombs at everyone. David and his bird allies come in to take out Murdstone and Grimby using the giant cheese globe, trapping them in a thick layer of cheese. The employees are freed and celebrate as Murdstone and Grimby are taken away. David finds and helps Mealy and Micawber to escape, along with the Moldies. The full-on sunlight that comes through the open grating is enough to break open the Moldies' captive cheese shells. The film ends on Christmas with David hosting the grand opening of the Copperfield Orphanage (with all Murdstone's former workers there) and  everyone cheering for David and Agnes' love.

Demolition Man (film)
  In 1996, [[psychopath]]ic career criminal Simon Phoenix kidnaps a number of hostages, and takes refuge with his gang in an abandoned building. [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Sgt. John Spartan uses a thermal scan of the building; finding no trace of the hostages, he leads an unauthorized assault to capture Phoenix. Phoenix sets off a series of explosives that bring down the building, and the corpses of the hostages are found in the rubble; Phoenix claims Spartan knew about the hostages and attacked anyway, leading to the arrest of Spartan for [[manslaughter]]. He is incarcerated along with Phoenix in the city's new "California Cryo-Penitentiary", where they are [[cryogenics|cryogenically frozen]] and exposed to subliminal rehabilitation techniques.  During their incarceration, the "Great Earthquake" of 2010 leads the cities of Los Angeles, San Diego, and Santa Barbara to merge into a single metropolis under the name San Angeles. The city becomes a utopia run under the pseudo-[[Pacifism|pacifist]] guidance and control of the evangelistic Dr. Raymond Cocteau where human behavior is tightly controlled. In 2032, Phoenix is thawed for a parole hearing; he somehow has access codes to the security systems and murders the warden and several guards, steals a car, and escapes the prison. The police, having not dealt with violent crime for many years, are unable to handle Phoenix; after six officers fail to apprehend Phoenix, Cocteau verbally authorizes the police to employ all means at their disposal. Lieutenant Lenina Huxley suggests that Spartan, having caught Phoenix before, should be revived and reinstated to help them stop him again. Spartan is thawed and assigned to Huxley to help with his acclimation to the future, which he finds depressing and oppressive. Others on the police force find his behavior brutish and uncivilized, and Huxley, though fascinated by the lifestyles of the late 20th century, is disgusted when Spartan suggests kissing and sexual intercourse, acts which are taboo in the future due to the exchange of bodily fluids and risk of transmitting diseases.  The police chief remains skeptical of Spartan, and predicts, with the help of a computer algorithm, that Phoenix will attempt to establish a crime syndicate, which Spartan finds ludicrous. Spartan instead correctly anticipates that Phoenix will attempt to secure firearms, which by 2032, are only in museum exhibits. At a museum, Phoenix acquires weapons before Spartan arrives, having their first face-to-face confrontation in 36 years. Phoenix escapes and encounters Dr. Cocteau but finds he is unable to shoot him - Cocteau had planned for Phoenix's release all along, and (as part of Phoenix's rehab) implanted a command which prevents Phoenix from harming Cocteau. Cocteau speaks to Phoenix about Edgar Friendly, the leader of a resistance group, 'the Scraps,' that rebel against Cocteau's rule. He allows Phoenix to bring other criminals out of cryo-sleep to help assassinate Friendly. After seeing the exchange on security cameras, Spartan and Huxley review cryo-prison records and find that instead of an appropriate criminal rehabilitation program, Phoenix had been given combat training programs and the information necessary for his escape (obviously provided by Cocteau). Realizing that Phoenix is after Friendly, they go off to warn him.  At the Scraps' underground base, Spartan convinces Friendly of the threat and takes sympathy in their cause given what he has seen above ground. Spartan and the Scraps ward off an attack by Phoenix's men, leading to a car chase between Spartan and Phoenix. Phoenix taunts Spartan by revealing that when they originally encountered each other in 1996, the hostages were already dead (killed by Phoenix), so Spartan spent 36 years in prison for no reason. Phoenix escapes, and Spartan arms himself with help from the Scraps.  Phoenix returns to Dr. Cocteau with his men, and orders one of them to kill Cocteau. They go back to the cryo-prison and begin to thaw out more convicts. Spartan enters the prison alone to fight Phoenix, heavily damaging the facility in the process; he uses the cryogenic chemical to freeze and kill Phoenix. Spartan escapes the prison as it explodes, and regroups with the police and the Scraps. The police fear that the loss of Cocteau and the cryo-prison will end society as they know it, but Spartan suggests that they and the Scraps work together to create a society which combines the best aspects of order and personal freedom. He then kisses Huxley (which she finds enjoyable) and the two go off together.

Dead Right (film)
 The film opens with a parody of the [[Simon Bates]] intro that used to accompany VHS rentals where Bates would explain to the viewer what certificate the film had received – 18 apparently – and what adult content they could expect to see.  The story begins with a serial killer bumping off the residents of a small [[Somerset]] community. Maverick DI Barry Stern is assigned to the case and – despite his reluctance – is partnered with by-the-book fellow DI Mike Tight.  On their first time out together Barry shoots a dealer trying to sell him cocaine in a public toilet. Meanwhile, the killer stalks a woman home from the supermarket and kills her by electrocution with a kitchen light.  Mike and Barry show up at the scene of the crime and discover the woman electrocuted to death. A box of cereal has been left on her head leading Barry to summise that they are now looking for a cereal killer.  Back at the precinct Mike addresses his fellow inspectors. He tells them that to catch the killer they must look at and obey the formula that most cop movies go by even though it is a British movie and there won't be any car chases. Barry points out that the partner usually dies in these kind of movies but Mike says he is thinking more along the lines of the ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' films.  The following day the police stakeout the local supermarket where they expect the killer to strike next. Barry is disguised as a mime. Mike is disguised an old lady to ensnare the killer. A small boy asks Barry for a mime. Barry gives him the finger that leads to him getting beaten up by the boy's elder brother.  Meanwhile, Mike proceeds to the local park followed by the killer. Once there he realises he is being followed and radios for help but it's too late. The killer attacks Mike and stabs him. Barry arrives on bike to find Mike dying. Mike says he loves Barry and gets him to give him a final kiss. Before he dies he tells him to look in the script to see where the killer is hiding out.  Barry arrives at a creepy looking house. There he is captured by the killer and tied to a chair. Barry says he knows who he is and proceeds to tell him his back-story: The killer is Philip Quinn. As a child he was made to eat cereal every day. He couldn't do it and in later years developed an inferiority complex about it. He then murdered his parents with a [[Black and Decker]] jigsaw and inherited their estate. He surrounded himself with waifs-and-strays that, like him, were hooked on cereal and slowly built up an army of [[hockey]] stick carrying box-men. He got a job at the local supermarket to satisfy his desire for cereal but he couldn't stand it when people would buy it for themselves and so he would follow them home and murder them.  Philip leaves Barry under the watchful eye of his beautiful sister Antonia. She seduces him and ten seconds later they are lying in bed together post-coitus. Barry handcuffs her to the chair and makes his escape.  Outside Barry encounters one of the box-men. He manages to defeat him by jumping on his face, which blows up. Meanwhile, Antonia sounds the alarm which summons a whole army of box-men. They chase him into a room that turns out to be an armoury. He tools-up and proceeds outside to face his adversaries. A gun battle ensues during which Barry discovers that one of the box-men is MI5 undercover agent Nigel Roscoe. The pair join forces to fend off the box-men. After a lengthy action sequence they manage to slaughter the army leading to much splatter and carnage. However, by this point Antonia has escaped and she hurls a knife into Nigel's back killing him. Barry shoots Antonia in the head.  Back at the supermarket Philip is working. Barry turns up to catch him but DI Jackson is waiting there to take Barry in. Barry subdues Philip but when Jackson interferes Barry lets Philip go to recapture him elsewhere. He tells Jackson not to follow him and lays chase.  In the local park Philip takes Edgar the director hostage and kills him. Barry breaks character, grabs a passing extra and gets her to direct the rest of the film.  Barry corners Philip in a playground. The pair have a showdown where they fight it out one-on-one. The fight culminates with Barry shooting Philip in the chest but only after reciting the "do you feel lucky" speech from ''Dirty Harry''. Philip begs for mercy and says he wants to be Barry's best friend. Barry shoots him in the head.  As the police show up to clear up the mess Barry has created he sits forlornly on a park bench. Disillusioned with the police he throws his badge away before rifling through his pockets and pulling out a pin, a police radio and a grenade. Realising too late that the pin was actually from the grenade and it goes off, ending the film.

Dennis the Menace (film)
 Dennis Mitchell ([[Mason Gamble]]) is a five-year-old boy who lives with his parents, Henry ([[Robert Stanton (actor)|Robert Stanton]]) and Alice ([[Lea Thompson]]) in [[Evanston, Illinois]], and is the bane of next door neighbour, George Wilson ([[Walter Matthau]]). One morning, George (or "Mr. Wilson" as Dennis calls him) pretends to be asleep in order to avoid dealing with Dennis. Dennis enters his bedroom, only to find him asleep with by his prescription medication on his night stand, and assumes he's sick. To make the man feel better, Dennis flings an aspirin into his mouth with a slingshot, causing him to gag and spit the aspirin out, as Dennis flees home.         When Dennis arrives home, his parents learn of the incident he had caused to Mr. Wilson and are both shocked, but because they both have to work, Alice has to take him to stay at Margaret Wade's house for the day. He isn't too happy about this, because Margaret is mean to him. When he arrives, he and Margaret, along with his best friend, Joey, venture into the woods to an abandoned tree house and intend to fix it up. Later, while getting paint from a high shelf in the garage, Dennis tries to grab his slingshot, which was taken away from him by Henry, and accidentally spills the paint on the floor. He then fervently attempts to vacuum it up, but ends up spilling a glob of it which splinters onto George's barbecue grill, while he's cooking chicken, and he tastes the paint and wood splinters as he eats it. That night, Dennis has a set of babysitters; Polly and her boyfriend, Mickey. He plays doorbell pranks on them and they retaliate by sticking a thumbtack on the doorbell and preparing water and flour to dump on the prankster. However, George goes over there to prove that Dennis was responsible for the paint on his chicken, against the wishes of his wife, Martha ([[Joan Plowright]]), only to ring the doorbell, stick his thumb, and get water and flour dumped on him, much to Martha's amusement. The next morning, Dennis goes over to the Wilsons' house to apologize for the events of the previous night, but finds himself playing with Mr. Wilson's dentures, losing the two front teeth down the drain, and replacing them with Chiclets in the process. This gets noticed when George gets his picture taken for the newspaper. Meanwhile, a burglar named Switchblade Sam ([[Christopher Lloyd]]) arrives in town and starts robbing people's houses, as well as stealing things outdoors and striking fear into children he meets.  Unfortunately for Henry and Alice, they have a difficult time getting people to watch Dennis while they both work. Unfortunately for George, he and Martha are being charged with the task of doing so, as both Henry and Alice are being called away on business trips on the same weekend. Martha loves Dennis as if he were her own grandson, as she and George never had children, and she enjoys telling Dennis a bedtime poem that her mother told her. Alternatively, George is further irritated by him for spilling bath water on the bathroom floor, replacing his nasal spray with mouthwash, and his mouthwash with toilet cleanser, and even bringing Dennis's pet dog, Ruff, into the house for a while.  Fortunately for George, he's been chosen to host the Summer Floraganza, a long awaited summer event. He has been growing and nurturing a rare night-blooming orchid for about forty years especially for it. Despite the investment, the flower dies shortly after it blooms. Alice’s flight is delayed due to a thunderstorm forcing Dennis to stay with the Wilsons for the night of the party. Martha is understanding, but George is deeply dismayed about this. But, at her insistence, he eventually agrees to let Dennis stay outside for the party only with a firm warning to behave himself. He doesn't enjoy it much because the guests pinch his cheeks, so he distances himself from them. However, in his curiosity, he finds himself pushing the garage door button, causing it to open, knock over the dessert table, and make a huge mess. George sees it and angrily bans Dennis from the party. Whilst inside, Dennis hears Switchblade Sam robbing the house, then goes downstairs and finds George's gold coins missing from the safe. Just as the flower is about to bloom, he alerts George of the robbery, distracting everyone just long enough to miss the flower's brief blooming span. Furious about his forty year investment gone to waste and the constant mishaps Dennis has caused (as well as knowing nothing about the robbery), George uproots the plant and severely scolds Dennis by telling him that he is selfish and spoiled, that he has no use for him, that the flower blooming meant more to George than Dennis ever will, and that he does not want to see or know Dennis anymore before telling his guests to leave. Heartbroken, Dennis flees on his bike, and rides off into the night. He then heads into the woods, where he eventually bumps into Sam, who abducts him, intending to use him as a hostage.  Henry and Alice arrive home soon after only to learn of their son's disappearance. They then contact the authorities and his friends to start looking for him. George, now feeling intense guilt and remorse about all the times he's yelled at Dennis and what he had said, especially since he really had been robbed, joins in the search in his car, and everyone ends up looking for the five-year-old all night. Meanwhile, Dennis unintentionally but effectively defeats Sam by tying him up with a rope, setting him on fire twice, accidentally bludgeoning him several times, handcuffing him, and losing the key in a pot of baked beans amongst other things. He then returns to the Wilsons' house the next morning with an injured Sam in the wagon attached to his bike, having also recovered Mr. Wilson's gold coins. Sam is then taken into police custody by an amused sheriff who had advised him earlier to leave town. Dennis and George make amends, and both the Mitchells and the Wilsons become close friends on better terms. That night, Alice tells the Wilsons that she does not have to travel out of town anymore and will stay to work on local projects and Dennis can come to work with her since they have a day care center. George scoffs at this saying he and Martha will be happy to continue watching him, explaining that he's learned some things about children by saying to both Henry and Alice that kids are kids and they have to play by their rules, roll with the punches, and expect the unexpected. Around the same time, just as Dennis is still trying to get the flame out of his marshmallow, it lands on George's forehead.   As the closing credits start to roll, Andrea, Alice's egotistical coworker, finds Dennis sitting near the copy machine as she comes in to use it. He asks to push the button on it, but she arrogantly tells him that he doesn't know what one to push. Sure enough, he pushes the "PRINT" one and runs off with other workers, including Alice, looking on. The paper feeder sucks up Andrea's scarf, her head gets pinned face down on the scanner bed, and the machine relentlessly flashes its blinding light in her eyes, repeatedly copies her face, and spews out page after page of black and white photos showing her various agonized facial expressions as she screams and cries on the scanner bed, eventually getting herself free.  
Devasuram
 Neelakantan ([[Mohanlal]]) is the spoilt heir to the well-known Mangalassery family. He squanders away his father's largess and good name, but is loved by the people who know him well. He has been the arch-rival of Shekaran of the Mundakkal family since childhood. During a minor ruckus, one of Neelakantan's aides accidentally kills Shekaran's uncle ([[Janardhanan (actor)|Janardanan]]). This incites Shekaran to plan to avenge the death of his uncle.  Meanwhile, Neelakantan offends Bhanumathi ([[Revathi Menon|Revathi]]), a talented [[Bharata Natyam]] dance graduate, by forcing her to dance in front of him in his house. In retaliation, Bhanumathi quits dancing and curses Neelakantan for desecrating the art so dear to her. Later he feels regretful and helps her family in many ways and tries to persuade Bhanumathi to take up dancing again, but she doesn't budge.  Meantime, Neelakantan visits his widowed mother intending to bring her back home, but she passes away after revealing a terrible secret; that he was born of another man, out of wedlock. This fact crushes him, and only Bhanumathi finds out this secret when he curses drunkenly (at the car of his deceased "father") that the ancestral heritage which he is proud of, is actually not his. She is surprised by the vulnerable side of Neelakantan.  He visits Banumathi at her home to persuade her to take up dancing again, only to be refused like before, telling him that she will resume dancing only after his death. That night while returning home from the visit, Shekaran and his aides ambush (by hitting him with a car from behind) and injure him seriously after also inflicting several wounds with swords and wooden sticks.  Neelakantan survives the attack, but his left hand and right leg are badly injured and as a cure he undergoes [[Ayurvedic]] treatment to rejuvenate his legs. It is during this time that Bhanumathi falls in love with him (she is also regretful for having cursed him, feeling a bit guilty that the attack was somehow related to her curse). Neelakantan convinces Bhanumathi to dance and he arranges for a dance event for her at [[Delhi]].He too loves her ardently but he refuses to marry Bhanumathi considering her future, but in the end she and Warrier (his elderly right-hand man) persuade him to do so.  Neelakantan tries to forget all the past events and his rivalry with Shekaran, but Shekaran is not satisfied and wants to defeat Neelakantan in front of the whole village. For this he kidnaps Bhanumathi and forces Neelakantan to take blows in front of the public during a village festival organized by the Mundakkal family. Meanwhile, Neelakantan's friends rescue Bhanumathi and after this Neelakantan mauls Shekaran badly and cuts off Shekaran's right hand, claiming "Shekeran, I want to live peacefully..." so that he will not again come up with revenge later. However while severing shekharan's right hand neelakandan uses the backside of the sword which shows the agony and power he had.  
Detectives on the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown
 The film opens on the studio set of a fictional 1990s TV show, ''The Gourmet Detective''. This is depicted as a crass cross-genre detective/cookery series ("two recipes and one murder per show"), whose lead character (played by Keith Allen) presents his recipe in a style that parodies [[Keith Floyd]]. Allen's "on-screen" Gourmet Detective character is the epitome of [[Political correctness|politically correct]] "new man" compassion, but the actor "off-screen" is shown to be an obnoxious, drug-taking womaniser. He is subsequently murdered – the second TV detective to be killed in six months – and the rest of the film involves the search for his assassin.  The police commander (played by [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]]) is exasperated that the detective assigned to the case, Dave Spanker, has come up with lots of "Northern nostalgia" but no leads. [[Cheesecloth]] and the footprint of a 1970s [[platform shoe]] are found at the scene, inspiring him to bring in 1970s-style detectives to help solve the crime – initially Bonehead, Foyle and George. When the platform shoe is revealed to be from the early 1970s, Jason Bentley is added to the team, and the commander insists that Bentley's methods alone are to be used ("no guns, no fast cars, no shouting"). Bentley consequently drives the detectives to a random country house, drinks copious claret, smokes endless cigarettes, and predictably gets nowhere with the case. The frustrated detectives have a punch-up while they are – on Bentley's advice – "waiting for a [[Mini Moke]] to turn up".  The commander gives the team a dressing-down, and explains that, with the TV-cop-killer still at large, the production of various 1990s TV cop shows is under threat. In order to highlight further the writers' views of contemporary TV detective shows, he lists these as ''The Dull as Dishwater Detective'', ''Detectives on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' and ''The Whistling Detective Who Lives on a Barge''. ''The Dull as Dishwater Detective'' is apparently in hiatus because "the actor's run abroad, he's scared" – a reference to the real TV series ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'', whose lead actor [[John Thaw]] was making ''[[A Year in Provence]]'' at this time.  Thaw had previously played Regan in ''The Sweeney''.  Bonehead, Foyle and George insist they be allowed to proceed with the investigation their way, complete with fast cars and guns. The commander reluctantly agrees to give them 48 hours, and they gleefully wheel-spin away to a rendezvous at an East End drinking den. Meanwhile, a sheepish Bentley asks to see the original lab reports.  At the pub, George asks to see his informant, while Bonehead and Foyle order [[Babycham]]s then storm the toilet cubicles the way they might storm an [[Iranian Embassy Siege|embassy]]. However, Bentley provides the breakthrough. He reveals that the forensic report proves the platform shoes were bought in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. After Spanker confesses that he committed the crimes due to TV ratings pressure, he makes his escape.  There ensues a 1970s-style high-speed [[car chase]] involving all but Bentley, based mainly in a large yard where all three cars drive around somewhat pointlessly in circles. The repeated handbrake-turns wreck Foyle's gearbox and, in frustration at missing out on the car chase, Bonehead briefly considers leaving his partner. However, the chase continues on foot into [[London Docklands]], where Spanker takes refuge.  Bonehead and Foyle – as is customary for them – remove their trousers for this final showdown, and then bemoan the Docklands redevelopment that has taken place since the 1970s: "where's all the wasteland and disused factories?". They nevertheless negotiate the area trouserlessly as if it is still full of rusty girders and rubble, to the bemusement of passing city workers.  Meanwhile, George attempts to talk Spanker into a surrender. Spanker complains that, with the increased realism in TV detective shows, he has missed out on the fast cars and the "shoot a man at a hundred yards crap" enjoyed by his 1970s counterparts. To prove the point, he feels no ill effects when George shoots him from this very distance as an apparent 1970s denouement to the scene. However, Bentley now magically appears exactly where the plot requires him to appear, right alongside Spanker. In a typically relaxed and tangential fashion, he manages to capture the detective effortlessly.  George devises a punishment for Spanker far worse than being shot at close range – Spanker will instead be "shot on [[videotape|tape]]". He has his scruffy hair cut to a regulation [[police constable]]'s length, in order to take his place as "a faceless copper in uniform - three nights a week". Spanker's suitably TV-based punishment is to become a member of the cast of ''[[The Bill]]''.  The film ends on an up-beat note, with Bonehead, Foyle, George, Bentley and the commander all [[Toast (honor)|drinking to]] "the Seventies".

Desperate Justice
 The film opens with [[Arizona]] housewife and mother Carol Sanders enjoying a morning run through the neighborhood with her 12-year-old daughter, Wendy. As they return, Carol's husband Bill reveals that he's managed to land an important business deal, though the happy mood is cut short after realizing that the couple's rebellious teenage daughter, Jill, has overslept again. Wendy offers to wake her, but a minor argument ensues between the two sisters after she does so, though Carol quickly defuses it.  Later that day, Carol must cover for a co-member of her women's club and host a club luncheon; however, the luncheon runs late, leaving her unable to pick up Wendy (who's staying after school to work on a science project). Since Bill is in [[Los Angeles]] for a meeting concerning his aforementioned business deal, Carol calls Jill at the record store where she works and asks her to pick Wendy up, but Jill inadvertently forgets about it until 10 minutes after she was supposed to be at Wendy's school.  However, once on the road, Jill runs into a traffic jam and doesn't get there until much later. Not finding Wendy anywhere on the school grounds, she hurries home and tells her parents the news; Bill returns to the school with her, but they are still unable to find Wendy, and the police are called, who soon discover the presence of blood and suspect it might be hers.  Unable to sleep that night, Bill and Carol receive a visit from one of the detectives on the case, who found Wendy on the side of the road after being [[rape]]d and badly beaten, which left her in a [[coma]]. She is brought to the local hospital's [[Intensive Care Unit|ICU]] while the police try to determine if the crime was committed by a school faculty member or a stranger. A tearful Jill says she feels like what happened was her fault, but Bill assures her that is not the case.  Two days later, a suspect is arrested: Frank Warden, the janitor at Wendy's school. As it turns out, Frank had two [[Sexual assault|molestation]] charges in [[California]], but they did not show up on his background check. While detectives assure Bill that they have a slam-dunk case, a number of discrepancies soon come to the surface in court, culminating in a solid [[alibi]] from Frank's mother, Bess, who testifies that her son was dining with her in a restaurant when the crime occurred, and the case is dismissed as a result. Seeing Frank smiling and laughing about the decision, a grief-stricken Carol suddenly snaps, pulls out a gun, and shoots Frank in open court, critically wounding him.  After Carol is released on [[bail]] following her arrest, Wendy emerges from her coma, though a doctor reveals that it will take time for her to recall the traumatic events she went through, and that she'll need support from her family and psychiatric help. In the meantime, Carol attempts to secure a [[defense attorney]] and approaches Ellen Wells, who had represented Frank Warden, but she is unable to do so, as Frank is still alive.  Desperate for assistance, Carol then tries to approach Frank's mother, but Bess angrily turns her away, revealing that Frank died in the hospital an hour earlier. Later that day, a tearful Wendy has suddenly learned about everything her mother has been through, along with her own ordeal (as Jill had filled her in), and in an emotional scene, Carol does her best to help her understand. However, this decision later sets off an argument between Jill and Carol, during which Jill accuses Carol of blaming her for what happened to Wendy and wishing it had happened to her instead.  Now having managed to secure Wells' service, the two prepare for Carol's case, but the unexpected twists and turns soon complicate things. To top it off, Carol returns home to find Jill and her boyfriend Brian making out in his car, and after Carol makes a scene about it, another argument ensues. Angrily, Jill repeats her earlier claim that Carol blames her for Wendy's ordeal, as well as not having any time for her, culminating in Jill storming out of the house.  By the next morning, Jill has still not returned home, causing Carol to miss her first court appearance, much to the presiding judge's annoyance. Finally, she finds Jill sitting by Wendy's hospital bed, and the two have a heart-to-heart talk where Carol admits that Jill was right: despite Carol's repeated denials, in trying to blame someone because of her overwhelming pain, she unfairly scapegoated Jill because she didn't want to blame herself.  However, Jill now sees the validity in what Bill told her earlier, and assures her mother that none of them are at fault. A short time later, Wendy has finally come home and the family has a "welcome home" party in her honor, but she admits to Jill that she's feeling "scared" and "different" from her family and friends, and wonders if they'll still like her. Jill assures Wendy that not only will they still like her, they'll like her more for the strength and courage she showed the whole time. Satisfied, she emerges from the house with Jill, and is warmly received by their family and the invited guests.  Not long after Wendy comes home, the trial finally begins, with Carol attempting to prove that she had lost control of herself in the moment she shot Frank Warden. However, the jury ultimately returns a [[guilt (law)|guilty]] verdict on the charge of [[manslaughter]], and a [[sentence (law)|sentencing]] date is set for two weeks later, but realizing that any further strain would not be good for Carol or the family, Wells makes a motion for a more immediate sentence, which is granted, and the date is moved up to the following day.  Just before the sentence can be handed down the next day, a voice from the gallery requests to address the court: Bess Warden, who admits to having provided a false alibi for her son at his original trial, thinking the courts could prove Frank's crime without her help. Realizing everything Wendy has been through, and knowing jail time will neither bring back her son nor make what he did to Wendy go away, she asks for leniency in Carol's sentencing. Moved by her statement, the judge reduces his originally planned 6-year sentence to just three years (which can be reduced to two for good behavior), and also grants weekend visitation rights to Carol's family.

 The film begins with Brick Bardo ([[Tim Thomerson]], from ''[[Dollman (film)|Dollman]])'' hitchhiking to get to the town of Pahoota, where he tries to find a girl named Nurse Ginger ([[Melissa Behr]], who was shrunken to 11 inches in ''[[Bad Channels (film)|Bad Channels]])'', to prove to her that she is not alone. Meanwhile, the film cuts to Judith Grey ([[Tracy Scoggins]] from ''[[Demonic Toys]])'', who has a nightmare about the events that happened in the previous film a year before. Ever since the events that took place a year before, Judith has been watching the Toyland Warehouse, believing that the toys are still alive. Meanwhile, a drunken bum ([[R.C. Bates]]) enters the warehouse to shelter from the rain, and starts to mess around with a clown tricycle, until he gets knocked in the head with a box of toys, causing him to hit his head on the ground, killing him. However, his blood continues to flow over to the place where the demon was buried, and brings back: Baby Oopsy Daisy, Jack Attack, and Mr. Static, but Grizzly Teddy is replaced by a new toy named Zombietoid - a blonde [[GI Joe]] action figure with a sword as a weapon.  Judith, who's now inside the building, sees the toys in full view, but is then arrested for breaking into a secluded building while serving out a suspension. After the police leave, the toys force the new security guard Ray Vernon ([[Phil Fondacaro]]) to help them with their needs. Ginger who spends her time on a kitchen counter all alone is being harassed by a sleazy reporter ([[Phil Brock]]) for an interview and so she reluctantly agrees to one so he'll leave her in peace. After he leaves, a big [[spider]] appears and as Ginger screams, Brick suddenly shows up and shoots it dead. Then a surprised Ginger asks Brick how he's so tiny like her, which results in both characters recapping their stories. Although Ginger explains that it's herself who's been left at a doll sized height by aliens, instead of Bunny, which was what occurred in the actual story of ''Bad Channels''.  Meanwhile, Judith, who now knows about Nurse Ginger and Brick Bardo's history, bribes the news reporter to tell her where they're at, and tells her they are in Pahoota. Judith, after having a deal with Bardo and Ginger to help her kill the toys, go to the warehouse and Ginger initially doesn't believe the tale about the toys being really alive. Meanwhile, the toys kill a blonde hooker and makes her bleed on the place where the demon was buried. As Judith and friends enter the building, a fight begins, ending with Judith weakenly shooting Ray in the head (killing him). Brick, who has made a promise to Judith '''('''''cop to cop thing''''')''', continues to finish that promise, but Zombietoid knocks his gun out of his hand and it falls under a pile of crates, and has his hands and feet tied to two toy trucks, and Ginger tied on to a clock when they are separated inside the ventilation shafts.  Baby Oopsy Daisy explains to Brick that once midnight strikes, the Demon's soul is going to go inside Baby Oopsy Daisy, so he can rape Nurse Ginger, make the baby, eat its soul from the shell, and become a human. As Baby Oopsie Daisy is about to kill Brick, Ginger breaks free, cuts him loose, and gets carried away by Zombietoid, who continues to go after Brick. Brick and Zombietoid begin fighting, until Zombietoid's machete gets caught in an electric socket, killing him. After using a hockey stick to retrieve his gun, Brick continues on and finds Jack Attack, whom he kills by shooting its face with a single bullet, causing Jack Attack to [[die laughing]], then leaving only his torso intact.  Brick finally gets to the dollhouse shortly after the stroke of midnight and sees Baby Oopsy Daisy undressing Ginger in preparation for sex. Baby Oopsy Daisey demands Brick to drop his firearm or he will quickly kill Ginger with cervical dislocation. Brick complies and tosses his gun out of his reach. Baby Oopsy Daisy tries to penetrate Ginger but is once again interrupted, this time due to a hard kick to his groin by Ginger after he unwittingly mentions that he is now possessed by "''[[Devil|The Master]]''" and has a [[penis]]. The low blow causes her to be released from Baby Oopsy Daisey's grasp, giving Brick the opportunity to quickly summon his gun where he then shoots the bewildered Baby Oopsy Daisy several times, killing him. Brick continues to call the police and tells them that Judith Grey died in the line of duty, and leaves, along with Nurse Ginger to a cab that is on its way back to Pahoota.

Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story
 The film begins with a nightmare of [[Lee Hoi-chuen|Bruce Lee's father]], who sees a terrifying phantom known as the Demon in black samurai armor that haunts the young Bruce Lee. In a montage that passes quickly through his teenage years in [[Hong Kong]], Bruce is shown receiving instruction in traditional [[Chinese martial arts]]. As a young adult, Bruce fights with British sailors harassing a young Chinese woman, and this results in him having to leave Hong Kong. His father suggests that Bruce go to the USA — Bruce was actually born in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], when his father was a performer touring there and so Bruce has a U.S. birth certificate. His father asks Bruce to become a success, so that his name will be famous even back in Hong Kong.  In America, Bruce works as a dishwasher at a Chinese restaurant, until a violent brawl with four of the cooks. The restaurant owner arrives and fires Bruce.  As well as severance, she gives him an "all-purpose loan" and exhorts him to invest in an education. While studying philosophy in college, he begins to teach martial arts classes, where he meets [[Linda Lee Cadwell|Linda Emery]]. They marry in defiance of Linda's racist mother. Linda suggests that Bruce open a martial arts school, but his Chinese peers demand he not train "blacks or Americans" and challenge him to settle the matter via combat. Bruce defeats Johnny Sun in a secretive, illegal, no-holds-barred honor match, but an embittered Sun attacks Bruce after having already admitted defeat. Sun's cowardly, vengeful attack results in a seriously debilitating back injury for Lee.  Linda is upset that Bruce did not tell her about the match. However, she nurtures him through his recovery, despite his despair and assumption that she will abandon him. She convinces him to examine his flaws and weaknesses and thus develop the fighting philosophy of [[Jeet Kune Do]], which is published in ''[[The Tao of Jeet Kune Do]]''. During this period Linda gives birth to their first child, [[Brandon Lee|Brandon]], which helps to assuage a reconciliation with Linda's mother.  Some months later, during [[Ed Parker]]'s martial arts tournament, Bruce faces Johnny Sun again, in a 60-second demonstration of his new fighting style. Johnny Sun appears to have the upper hand in the first half minute, but then Bruce dominates Sun, finishing by kicking him over the top rope into the crowd. Bruce is subsequently praised by the crowd.  After the match, Bruce meets Bill Krieger and is hired for ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'' television series. Bruce and Bill work together and create the idea for the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' television series.  At a cast party, Linda says she is now pregnant with [[Shannon Lee|their second child]]. Shortly afterwards, there is an announcement for the cancellation of ''The Green Hornet''. ''Kung Fu'' makes it to television, but much to Bruce's frustration, it stars [[David Carradine]], a Caucasian. Bruce believes that Krieger has betrayed him.  Bruce returns to Hong Kong for his father's funeral, where Philip Tan, a Hong Kong film producer, informs Bruce of his fame there, where ''The Green Hornet'' show is called ''The Kato Show''. Bruce begins work on the feature film ''[[The Big Boss]]''. In the filming of the final scene, set in an ice factory, Johnny Sun's brother Luke attacks Bruce, wanting revenge, but Bruce emerges victorious.  ''The Big Boss'' is a success. Bruce makes several more films, working as actor, director and editor. This causes a rift between Bruce and Linda, as she wishes to return to the U.S. Krieger shows up, and although he knows that Bruce is still angry with him, he offers him a chance to work on a big-budget [[Hollywood movie]], particularly as Linda wishes to return to the States.  On the 32nd day of shooting ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', during the [[Climax (narrative)|climactic]] "room of mirrors" sequence, Bruce has a terrifying vision of the phantom samurai that has haunted his dreams since childhood. However, this time, being shown and beaten against his own grave, he saves his son Brandon and breaks the dark warrior's neck. The film ends during a shot of the final scene of ''Enter the Dragon'', the film that would make Lee an international film star. Linda informs the audience that Bruce died before the movie's release, and goes on to state that she has preferred to discuss Bruce Lee's life, not his death.  
Dragon Ball Z: Broly – The Legendary Super Saiyan
 On his planet in the Otherworld, [[King Kai]] senses the destruction of the South Galaxy by an unknown Super Saiyan, and realizes that the [[Milky Way|North Galaxy]] will be next. To this end, King Kai contacts [[Goku]] telepathically while he and [[Chi-Chi (Dragon Ball)|Chi-Chi]] are sitting down having an interview inside a private school which they hope to send [[Gohan (Dragon Ball)|Gohan]] to. In the middle of the interview, Goku [[teleportation|teleports]] to King Kai's planet and is told the entire story.  Meanwhile, on Earth, while the Z-Fighters are picnicking in an unknown peaceful area, a spaceship lands and an army of humanoids appear and greet Vegeta as their king. Their leader is a Saiyan, Paragus, who claims that he has created a New Planet Vegeta and wishes for Vegeta to accompany him in order to rule as the new king. Vegeta initially refuses, but agrees after Paragus tells him that a being known as the "Legendary Super Saiyan" is running rampant throughout the galaxy and must be destroyed before he comes to Earth. Skeptical of Paragus' story, Gohan, [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]], [[Kuririn|Krillin]], [[Master Roshi]] and [[Oolong (Dragon Ball)|Oolong]] go along with [[Vegeta]].  On New Vegeta, Vegeta meets Paragus' son, [[Broly]], and the two leave together to hunt down the Legendary Super Saiyan. Gohan, Trunks and Krillin meet the planet's slaves and defend them from their abusive masters. During the struggle, Goku arrives via Instant Transmission, having followed their energy signals after King Kai's story. The slaves tell them that the Legendary Super Saiyan destroyed their planet, and they were found by Paragus, who made them into his slaves. That night, Vegeta and Broly return, having had no luck. While Vegeta receives Goku coldly, Broly appears agitated at the mere sight of him, and only calms down when Paragus raises his hand and a light shines on his bracelet. Despite this, Broly attacks Goku in the middle of the night. The two fight evenly matched for a while until Paragus appears and calms Broly down again. After the fight Goku suspects that Broly is the Legendary Super Saiyan due to their similar ki and also begins to doubt Paragus' claims. Paragus, for his part, has been controlling Broly with a mind control device, which he suspects may be malfunctioning. Paragus then realises that it is Broly's connection to Goku that has made him angry: Broly and Goku were born on the same day and were in neighbouring pods, and Goku's constant crying agitated Broly so much that it made him resent Goku for many years afterwards, and now, having come face to face with him, old wounds have begun to surface.  Vegeta soon loses patience with Paragus and decides to return to Earth with the others, but Goku and the others confront Paragus, having realised that Broly is in fact the Legendary Super Saiyan himself. The slaves, upon seeing Broly, also identify him as the one who destroyed their planet, but Broly again becomes fixated on Goku, and his rage erupts so much that he breaks free of the mind control device and transforms into a behemoth of a Super Saiyan: the Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly sets his eyes on Goku and begins fighting him and the others, while Vegeta, frightened of the Legendary Super Saiyan, loses the will to fight. Paragus taunts Vegeta for his naïveté and reveals his true story and intentions: many years ago, on Planet Vegeta, Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, (but Goku was born with a power level of 2), which was an impressive feat for anyone, let alone a baby to achieve. However, [[King Vegeta]] feared that the baby would grow up to become a threat to his royal family line and ordered him executed. Paragus barged into the court and begged King Vegeta to spare him, but he refused and severely wounded Paragus. Broly was stabbed in the stomach, and he and Paragus were left for dead. However, that same day, [[Frieza]] destroyed Planet Vegeta, and just before the explosion, Broly manifested his anger to blast him and Paragus away from Planet Vegeta only seconds before demolition. Because of Goku's crying, the attempted execution, and having to survive the Saiyan eradication, Broly grew into a severely unstable child. At one point, he even blinded Paragus in one eye, and Paragus only managed to pacify him via the mind control device. Since then, Paragus' goal has been revenge on King Vegeta through his son, Vegeta, and to take over the Earth as a new Planet Vegeta from which to rule the entire [[universe]]. Furthermore, a [[comet]], Camori, is approaching New Vegeta, and will destroy it upon impact.  Broly makes quick work of Goku, Gohan and Trunks. [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] arrives with Senzu beans and is also beaten, but summons enough will power to forcibly bring Vegeta to the battlefield. Seeing Broly pummel his friends repeatedly eventually gives Vegeta enough incentive to join the fight, but he also proves to be no match for Broly. Paragus tries to escape from New Vegeta by himself, but Broly catches him in the act and kills him by crushing the space pod with his bare hands and throwing it towards the comet. However, despite Broly's power, Goku refuses to stay down, and takes every blow Broly lands on him, even with his friends offering him their remaining power. After much reluctance, Vegeta finally gives some of his energy, which gives Goku enough power to resist Broly and punch him in exactly the same place where he was stabbed as a baby, causing Broly to bleed profusely and apparently explode.  Just as Camori hits and destroys New Vegeta, the Z Fighters and the slaves escape in the spaceship Piccolo used to follow Goku and Vegeta. Goku and Gohan teleport straight to their garden, where they are confronted by an angry Chi-Chi, who is annoyed with Goku for leaving during the interview. Goku then comically recites what Chi-Chi told him to say for the school interview, causing her to faint.  
Dragon Ball Z: Bojack Unbound
 Bojack is the main villain of the movie. His goal is to conquer the universe and destroy all those that stand in his way. According to [[North Kaio|King Kai]], he was sealed by all four Kais in a star, but when [[Son Goku (Dragon Ball)|Goku]] teleported the devolved, ready to self-destruct [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]] to King Kai's planet, killing him, the seal had broken, allowing Bojack to reap destruction upon the Earth.  The movie starts with a big martial arts tournament in which 200 elite fighters will compete, including [[Yamcha]], [[Tenshinhan|Tien]], [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], [[Gohan (Dragon Ball)|Gohan]], [[Future Trunks]], and [[Kuririn|Krillin]]. The winner will get to face the famous champion, Hercule. Goku is shown in Other World, watching the tournament with King Kai. The first round consists of 8 contests - 25 fighters are put on each fighting "stage", and the last one standing on each stage will advance to the semi-finals. Tien, Piccolo, Gohan, Krillin, and Future Trunks are among the 8 who advance. As the advancing fighters' names are announced, Hercule is shown getting increasingly nervous, as he is aware of the prowess of these fighters. He begins looking for a way to back out of the fighting, eventually claiming to have a stomach ache. In the meantime, the semis pit Tien against Future Trunks and Krillin against Piccolo. Future Trunks and Tien fight evenly before Trunks goes Super Saiyan and quickly defeats Tien. Piccolo is disgusted by the lack of a challenge in this supposedly "elite" contest and forfeits against Krillin. Gohan, Krillin, and Future Trunks are among the 4 who advance to the finals, in which each of them will compete against a fighter from elsewhere in the galaxy. However, as the alien fighters are revealed, the fight promoter realizes that these are not the fighters that he had recruited for the contest.  Everyone soon begins to realize that there is something wrong as Future Trunks is challenged by Kogu, Krillin is beaten by Zangya, and Gohan confronts Bujin, one of the fighters is killed by Bido. During this time, Hercule is in the rest room, thinking about how he got himself in this mess, but after looking at his belt he realizes that the people need him and, in an uncharacteristically brave mood he goes out and gets slammed into a space pod and sent to the fighting. During his fight against Kogu, Trunks transforms into a [[Super Saiyan]], shatters Kogu's sword, and shoves his fist right through Kogu's abdomen, thus killing him. As he turns to leave, he is struck down in one blow by an unknown foe. Far away, Vegeta feels this power and knows something is wrong. Gohan continues his fight with Bujin until he is led out to where Krillin and Trunks are. After inspecting his fallen friend, Bojack introduces himself and tells Gohan his plans to rule the universe as his revenge. [[Yamcha]] and Tien turn up to fight but are defeated by Bujin, Bido and Zangya. Seeing his friends fallen, Gohan transforms into a Super Saiyan and fights Bojack's henchmen while Bojack watches on in amusement. Gohan is beaten down and Bojack powers up an attack to finish him off, although it is deflected by Piccolo, who has come to Gohan's aid. Trunks comes back into action and they both challenge Bojack. After a period of fighting Trunks's sword appears; Trunks catches it as Vegeta enters the fight and transforms into a Super Saiyan, quickly setting on Bojack. During this, Trunks thinks that Vegeta would only ever fight when it meant him surpassing Goku's strength, and Trunks realizes that Vegeta has truly changed. While Vegeta fights Bojack, the rest fight against his surviving henchmen. During his fight against Vegeta, Bojack beats Vegeta down and transforms. Gohan rushes to Piccolo's aid, but Piccolo tells him to not worry about him and fight Bojack. Bojack challenges Gohan to a fight and beats him thanks to the aid of Bido and Zangya's Untrapped ropes, which drains Gohan's energy away, but Gohan is freed when Hercule's incoming pod distracts them all. Annoyed at this, Bojack powers up an attack and blasts Hercule's pod, causing him to fall to the ground. Trying to save him, Gohan is struck down by Bojack's henchmen.  On Snake Way with King Kai, Goku can't watch any more and, using his Instant Transmission, teleports himself to the fight and punches Bojack before he can finish Gohan off. Surprised, Bojack falls to the ground. After a few words of advice, Goku places his son on the ground safely and disappears. Gohan, taking in his father's words, gets back and turns to Bojack with fire in his eyes. Gohan gets furious and transforms into [[Super Saiyan 2]], turning the table against Bojack and his crew. Gohan beats [[Bido (Dragon Ball)|Bido]] and [[Bujin (Dragon Ball)|Bujin]] each in one-hit, breaking them both in half, and Zangya is killed when Bojack uses her as a shield from Gohan. The angry young Saiyan then slams his fist into Bojack's stomach, blowing a hole in his stomach and out through his back. As a last resort, Bojack powers up his Galactic Buster and Gohan prepares a Super [[Dragon Ball|Kamehameha]]. The energies clash together and in the blinding light Bojack is killed. Gohan, exhausted, falls backwards laughing as Goku praises him from Other World, and King Kai jokes that Goku broke the rules of going back to Earth while dead. After the events, everyone is in hospital watching the news that Hercule is a "true hero" who defeated the alien intruders; this results in several jokes as they laugh. As in ''Super Android 13!'', the movie closes with Piccolo and Vegeta on the roof, arms folded and backs turned to each other, isolating themselves from the celebration. During the closing credits, "Ginga o Koete Raijingu High" plays with some pictures showing any of the Dragon Ball Z characters doing something being displayed on the left.  Finally, this graph is surrounded as though in a frame by several of the main characters, including Krillin, Trunks, Roshi, and Yamcha, all dressed in different colored suits, similar to the Toriyama drawn picture before.

He begins training [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]] (the son of [[Vegeta]] and [[Bulma]]), who is eager to defend the Earth. Gohan attempts to provoke Trunks enough to trigger his transformation into a Super Saiyan. Several times, Trunks comes close, but lacks enough motivation to maintain the form.  The androids attack an amusement park. Gohan transforms and battles them but is being overwhelmed. Trunks comes to his aid and fights Android #18 but is easily defeated.

They go home where he recovers and resume Trunks' training.  Just as the training is finished, a huge explosion hits the city. Gohan pretends to agree to allow Trunks to join him in the battle, then knocks him unconscious and goes alone.

Trunks awakens after sensing Gohan's energy signal vanish, and hurries to the city to find Gohan's body laying face down in a puddle of water. Trunks is enraged at the death of his best friend, which finally triggers his transformation into a Super Saiyan.  Three years later, Trunks and Bulma are working on a time machine when a warning sounds, indicating that the androids are nearby. Trunks confronts them but is badly beaten and left for dead. He awakens in his house with his mother at his side, and finally decides they must use the time machine to deliver the medicine needed to cure Goku's heart disease years ago by giving it to Goku himself, hoping that this will prevent Goku's death and prevent their future from happening.

As the credits roll, scenes are shown of Trunks' battle with Mecha-Frieza, his encounter with Goku and the Z Fighters, and the awakening of Androids 17 and 18.

Double, Double, Toil and Trouble
 Kelly ([[Mary-Kate Olsen]]) and Lynn Farmer's ([[Ashley Olsen]]) parents, Don ([[Eric McCormack]]) and Christine ([[Kelli Fox]]), are deeply in debt and in danger of losing their home. During the Halloween season, they visit Christine's cold and cruel Aunt Agatha ([[Cloris Leachman]]) to ask for a loan, which is immediately refused. While the girls wait outside, they meet Agatha's grave digger ([[Wayne Robson]]) who tells them the story of Agatha's twin sister Sophia (also played by Cloris Leachman) who is trapped inside the house. He explains to the girls that Agatha’s home once belonged to a powerful witch who, before being burned at the stake 200 years before, had hidden her moonstone, the rare gem which gave her power. As children, Agatha and Sophia, tired of being twins, heard the tale and began looking for the stone in hopes of using its power to no longer be identical anymore. Agatha found the moonstone but hid it from her sister and instead began using the magic it possesses to make her sister’s life miserable. Years later on Halloween, Sophia and her fiancé George, now Agatha's butler, prepared to elope and begin their life together, but Agatha, out of jealously and rage, cast a spell that banished her sister into the netherworld through a mirror, which she keeps hidden in the attic. On the 7th year at midnight, this Halloween, the spell will become permanent and there will be no way for Sophia to be rescued.  Back at home, Kelly and Lynn learn of their parents' financial problems. Christine expresses that if Aunt Sophia were still around, she'd be able to help them. Knowing this, the girls begin a rescue mission to free Aunt Sophia before it's too late. The spell can only be broken by twins who have possession of the moonstone, so Kelly and Lynn’s ultimate goal is to apprehend it. The only problem is, Aunt Agatha wears the gem around her neck at all times. While out trick or treating, they swap costumes with two other kids so they are able to get away from their parents. The first person they meet is a homeless man who dreams of money and stardom, Mr. N ([[Meshach Taylor]]), who offers to help the girls because they shouldn't be on such a dangerous journey without an adult. The girls carry with them a toy magic wand that they won at a Halloween party days before, which actually has unexplained genuine magical powers. Kelly, Lynn and Mr. N visit a phony psychic to ask where they are able to find the witches gathering that Aunt Agatha will attend that night, but Lulu is unable to answer, so instead, they use the wand to find the location and set off again by secretly hitching a ride on a pumpkin truck. They get dropped off near a woodland and find a small house deep inside, the home of a man named Oscar ([[Phil Fondacaro]]) who wishes to be taller. They tell him the whole story and he agrees to go along with them. Meanwhile, Don and Christine discover the girls have gone and inform the police.  Aunt Agatha overhears the girls' plan using the magic mirror and starts doing anything she can to get rid of them. She is threatened by their presence because she knows that the power of twins combined is superior to her own. Kelly, Lynn, Mr. N and Oscar turn up at the gathering in costumes in hopes of fitting in better and they oversee the events inside. Aunt Agatha reveals the story of her spell on her sister to the crowd while Mr. N and Oscar create a plan to try to get her to hand over the moonstone, which she does, intrigued by their promise to double her power. However, they are soon found out and get chased through town. They decide to split up; Lynn, who has the moonstne, with Oscar, and Kelly goes with Mr. N.  Followed by Agatha and her butler, Kelly and Mr. N run into a dead end at an abandoned warehouse. He goes out to confront her but she turns him into a crow, leaving Kelly alone. Later on, Aunt Sophia appears to Kelly, expressing that Aunt Agatha has freed her, but Kelly realises it's a trick and that Aunt Agatha has transformed herself to try and catch her. She manages to tie Agatha up with the magic wand, which messes with her power, but Kelly then gets caught by George when she flees from the building. Mr. N, as a crow, finds Lynn and Oscar to tell them what's happened, and Lynn starts to panic, since her and Kelly have never been apart and Kelly is probably scared all by herself. In the same part of town, Lynn finds where Mr. Gravedigger lives and goes to ask for his help since he knows his way around Aunt Agatha's house more than any of them. On their way, the police officer looking for the girls sees them driving away. She informs Don and Christine where she saw them, and Christine realises it's near Aunt Agatha's mansion so that's probably where they're heading.  Fifteen minutes to midnight, the group break into the house to search for the mirror. Lynn hears Aunt Sophia crying out for help in the attic and she goes to investigate. The good news is, Lynn has the moonstone, but the bad news is, Kelly isn't there, and she needs both twins to free her. Minutes later, Agatha, George and Kelly arrive, and Agatha attempts to poison them with jealousy and resentment toward one another. She tries to persuade Lynn into betraying her sister, but Lynn refuses, since she's realised Kelly is the most important person in her life. Still, she promises to hand over the moonstone if Agatha lets everyone go, which Agatha agrees to. Lynn places the moonstone on the floor and then Aunt Agatha breaks her end of the promise, threatening to turn everybody into animals forever. Mr. N flies down the staircase and snatches the moonstone away in his beak, while Kelly escapes from George's watch and the girls flee upstairs to free Sophia together. They ask Sophia what the incantation is, but Sophia reveals that it has to come from their hearts.  Aunt Agatha bursts into the room laughing, revealing that it's after midnight. Lynn and Kelly tell each other that they love each other and want to be sisters no matter what anybody else says or thinks; the power of love and loyalty transcends all, and Sophia is finally freed. Lynn explains she pushed the clocks ahead five minutes, so it wasn't too late after all. Enraged, Agatha attempts to push her sister back into the mirror, but the twins fight back and Agatha falls into the mirror herself. All of Agatha's evil magic is undone and the mirror is shattered, thus dooming her to spend the rest of her life in solitude in the netherworld.  Don and Christine arrive at the mansion to find Sophia safe and happily returned. Everyone keeps what happened a secret, preferring to tell them that Agatha went on a long trip to "reflect". Kelly and Lynn thank their new friends for helping them out; Mr. Gravedigger for his courage and bravery when standing up to "you know who", Oscar for his fabulous plans and distractions, and Mr. N for being their first companion who looked out for them on the road. He tells them he's also learnt that money is just money and that friends are more important. Aunt Sophia and George fall in love all over again, and redecorate the mansion so it's a second home for the whole family. She also agrees to give the Farmers the money they need to save their home.  Days later while enjoying family time in the garden, Lynn and Kelly are cleaning up the broken mirror in the attic and they see Aunt Agatha in one of the broken pieces. She asks for help, but the twins say "No chance" and walk out of the attic while holding hands and the magic wand. The movie ends with Aunt Agatha shouting, "I hate Halloween!"  
Dorf Goes Fishing
  === Grunt the Caveman === Dorf begins the video by introducing us to 'Grunt', a caveman who looks peculiarly similar to Dorf (and is also played by Tim Conway). Grunt is credited as the caveman that 'discovers' fishing and yelling. He is not too intelligent, but he knows that 'food can be gotten from the water. The question was how to get that food out of the water and into your mouth.' After many attempts, a vine works.  ===Fishing Gear=== Dorf demonstrates modern clothes and equipment of fishing, albeit not properly.  ===Dorf and His Wife - Segment One=== Dorf's friend Billy Bob couldn't make it to fish, so Dorf convinces his amateur wife to join him. Despite inappropriate clothing and nearly useless gear, she catches more fish than her husband.  ===The D.I.P. Shopping Network=== The video shifts gears and turns to the "Discount In Price" shopping channel, or "DIP" for short. All of their products have the name "DIP" in them. Dorf demonstrates the items, often with their negative side effects included. The number to order them from is 1-(555) DIP-FISH.  ===Dorf and His Wife - Segment Two=== Dorf and his wife continue to fish; at this point, she has over 30 fish, while Dorf has none. Dorf is, however, determined to catch a fish, and determines that her simple pole is superior to his own. However, after they trade, his wife catches yet another impressive fish, while Dorf's bacon has been stolen away.  ===Cooking with Carly=== Dorf has prepared his campsite for his favorite cooking show, "Cooking with Carly". Carly (also played by Tim Conway) is a ditzy chef who appears to have drunken a bit too much 'Sauce'. The recipe is for 'Taters, Fish, and Biscuits'.  * '''Step One''' Carly instructs that the potatoes have to be washed and covered in [[aluminum foil]]. Dorf hurriedly douses them in water to keep up with the show's fast pace, but fumbles with the foil, tossing the potatoes hastily in the fire. * '''Step Two''' Carly begins to filet the fish with 'one swipe', but Dorf claims that his wife has been 'cutting cardboard boxes' with the filet knife, so he proceeds to sharpen the knife, but slices his finger in the process. After wrapping the wound in an oily rag, he attempts to debone the fish, but fumbles when he tries to take the whole skeleton out in one quick swipe. * '''Step Three''' Carly opens the biscuit mix bag easily, but Dorf fails to rip it open as easily. As he fails to keep up, he burns his hand on the oven, but places the mix inside. * '''Step Four''' Dorf places the fish into the frying pan, but cannot bring the plastic wrap under control to cover his biscuit mix. * '''Step Five''' Carly instructs to remove the fish from the frying pan, but warns that the handle may be hot. Dorf does not heed this warning, however, causing him to throw the pan (and fish) into the air. The fish lands on the ground, ruining it. * '''Step Six''' Again, Carly warns that the potatoes cannot be placed in the center of the campfire. As Dorf wonders about this, a potato suddenly flies out, barely missing his head. Another potato explodes into his face, covering him in potato pieces. * '''Step Seven''' Carly shows the eight-minute biscuits she prepared. However, Dorf's are still extremely runny as he takes them out of the oven. Carly reminds everyone that at a high altitude campsite, cooking the biscuits require an extra two minutes. * '''Step Eight''' Carly retrieves a set-up version of the meal from off-set, which is inexplicably and obviously pre-prepared. Dorf's fish, potatoes, and biscuits are ruined, and of course nothing like the show claims. Carly finally recommends that the meal be finished off with 'sauce', and she swigs some with a "WOO-HOO!" as the program ends. Dorf angrily takes a swig from his water supply and mutters, "Awoo-hoo."  As he walks away from the campsite, the last potato explodes into his face, and he drenches his face in water to keep from getting burnt.  ===Dorf and His Wife - Segment Three=== Dorf is sitting alone in his boat. His wife tells him to come back to shore; she had caught 63 fish, and Dorf has yet to catch one. The wife drives away without him, as he sits alone in the boat. The credits roll by as he calls for help from others and insults his wife.

Little does Jane know that Rita - with the help of her teenage son Patrick ([[Jonah Blechman]]) - kidnapped her baby daughter, and switched records between a stillborn child and healthy child to make it appear as if Jane's baby was stillborn.

Meanwhile, Jane becomes convinced that her baby wasn't stillborn, but instead of receiving support, her relatives and best friend Sharon (Michelle Joyner) believe that she is addicted to drugs and suffering from a depression, and suggest her to visit a psychiatrist. Even though she is estranging herself from everyone she knows, Jane continues to find out the truth and slowly recollects all the memories of her labor. In the hospital, she runs into Nurse Ramsey (Karmin Murcelo), who helped her with her labor before Rita stepped in. Ramsey admits that she remembers that her baby was alive and healthy when she last checked up on her, but she is too afraid to support her theories. Therefore, Jane hires attorney Gail Huddle ([[Penny Johnson]]) to sue the hospital, only to find out her case is hopeless since her records have gone missing (due to Rita).

After discovering an antique metal plate near a construction site, Ernest shows it to Dr. Melon who believes that it came from a giant [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] [[cannon]] called "Goliath", (named after the [[Goliath|legendary biblical giant]]). Dr. Melon had previously been ridiculed by his peers for theorizing that the real [[Crown Jewels of England]] were stolen during the Revolutionary War and were actually hidden inside the long-lost cannon.   They begin to search for the artifact near the construction site and eventually locate it inside an abandoned mine. Unfortunately, they are ambushed by historical antiquity collector and Dr. Melon's colleague Dr. Glencliff whom they then lead on an action-packed chase through the countryside. Things become more complicated for them when British authorities hear about the incident and send a team of secret agents after them to retrieve the jewels. Dr. Melon's wife, Nan, on the other hand is only after him and Ernest for the jewels. While everyone is hot on their trail, Ernest develops a deep friendship with Dr. Melon. After crashing the cannon into a forest, Ernest locates the [[jewels]], not in its barrel as the legend describes but in the [[gunpowder]] [[kegs]]. After putting the [[crown (headgear)|crown]] on his head, he finds himself unable to get it off. Dr. Glencliff shows up, abducts him, and takes him to his [[clinic]] in an attempt to surgically remove it and kill him at the same time. Dr. Melon meets up with Nan and convinces her to help him save Ernest.   While at the clinic, Ernest manages to escape from the surgery room and lead Dr. Glencliff on a chase through the building. When he has nowhere else to hide, he and Dr. Glencliff have one last fight to get the crown before Dr. Melon arrives with the police. At the last minute, Dr. Glencliff takes an axe off of the wall and attempts to behead Ernest. Just as he is moments away from death, Dr. Melon bursts through the door and hits Dr. Glencliff over the head with the same antique metal plate Ernest found, knocking him out. Ernest realizes that Dr. Melon has saved his life and they both realize that they have gone from being adversaries to friends. At the same time, British authorities arrive and explain to Ernest that the crown must be taken back to its rightful home. He explains that it won't come off his head and the authorities declare that whoever wears it is King of England. Fortunately for him (and [[England]]), Dr. Melon removes it for him by joking him about what is on his shirt, flicking him in the face. It causes it to fall off his head while everyone laughs. This is followed by him giving Dr. Melon a noogie while they argue about who would make a better king of England. The film wraps here with a not-so-subtle moral, being that friendship is more valuable than status or material wealth.

She flees to the cave and Xhabbo advises them to “follow the wind” by heading west across the Kalahari Desert. On the edge of the desert, Xhabbo communicates with a herd of elephants and convinces them to cover their tracks by following behind. Harry is furious to learn they have 2,000 miles to travel before reaching the seaport of Karlstown, but Nonnie remains optimistic.  Meanwhile, the Parkers’ close friend, Colonel Mopani Theron, learns of the attack and, unaware of his involvement, orders Ricketts to lead an aerial search party to find the missing children. Although Harry attempts to flag down the helicopter as it soars overhead, Nonnie worries they could be poachers and instructs her companions to hide. As a trick, the children remove their clothes, stuff them with straw, and lay them in the sand. Nonnie watches in horror as Ricketts pulls out his gun and shoots the fake bodies until he believes they are dead.  Over the next two months, the travelers dig up plant roots for sustenance, and Xhabbo teaches Harry how to speak his native language and hunt gemsbok. During this time, Col. Theron remains convinced that the Parkers’ death was a corporate conspiracy, and continues his tireless search for the exporters’ store of elephant tusks, which he believes will lead him to the murderer. At Xhabbo’s encouragement, Harry presents Nonnie with a vest made from gemsbok pelt. That night, Nonnie and Harry mourn the loss of their parents and share a hug. Near a remote general store, the owner’s hunting dogs chase the fugitives across a gorge, but they escape with only minor injuries.  A few days later, Ricketts meets a buyer at the same shop and notices that the owner is in possession of Nonnie’s necklace, which she lost in the scuffle. Suspecting the children are still alive, Ricketts kills his right-hand man for failing to ensure the bodies were buried. As Nonnie, Harry, and Xhabbo succumb to the heat of the desert sun, a scorpion stings Xhabbo. He tells his friends to continue without him, but Nonnie and Harry insist they stay together. When Nonnie wanders off in search of water, she collapses in the sand. Hearing the hum of Ricketts’ approaching helicopter, Nonnie and Xhabbo weakly thump their chests in the spiritual Bushman practice of “tapping,” which summons a sandstorm that forces Ricketts to flee. Unaware they are only a few yards away from the Atlantic coast, the three travelers fall unconscious and awaken in a Karlstown hospital. There, Nonnie is reunited with Col. Theron and informs him that Ricketts was responsible for her parents’ deaths. Once they are recovered, Nonnie and Harry accompany Col. Theron to Ricketts’ mining facility, where they find his hoard of elephant tusks. Nonnie insists the remains must be buried, and they begin to rig the facility with dynamite when Ricketts arrives to stop them. Harry traps Ricketts under a pile of tusks, and Nonnie holds him at gunpoint, but cannot shoot. Together, they lead the perpetrator outside and light the fuse. Unable to see his fortune destroyed, Ricketts runs back into the mine in an attempt to extinguish the flame, but the dynamite explodes and buries him beneath the rock.  Sometime later, Nonnie and Harry say goodbye to Xhabbo, who returns to the Kalahari. Harry kisses Nonnie before boarding an airplane home to New York, and Nonnie tells him to leave without looking back. However, as she and Col. Theron begin cleaning the charred remains of the Parker home, Harry returns, and the children embrace.

He abandons his car on the [[Four Level Interchange]] and begins walking west across Los Angeles to attend Adele’s birthday party in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]].  At a convenience store, the Korean owner refuses to give Foster change for a telephone call. Foster begins ranting about the high prices. The owner grabs a baseball bat and demands Foster leave. Foster takes the bat and destroys some of the merchandise before paying for a soda and leaving. Shortly thereafter, while resting on a hill, he is accosted by two Mexican gang members who threaten him with a [[butterfly knife]] and demand his briefcase. Foster attacks them with the bat and picks up the knife when they flee.  The two gang members, now in a car with friends, cruise the streets and find Foster in a phone booth. They open fire, hitting several bystanders but not Foster. The driver loses control and crashes their car. Foster approaches the wreck and picks up an [[Uzi]] [[submachine gun]] and a large leather bag filled with firearms belonging to the gang. Foster taunts, then shoots the one surviving gang member in the leg, and then leaves with the bag of weapons.   At a fast food restaurant, Whammy Burger, Foster attempts to order breakfast, but they have switched to the lunch menu. After an argument with the manager, Foster pulls a [[TEC-9]] submachine gun and accidentally fires into the ceiling. After trying to reassure the frightened employees and customers he won't hurt anyone, he orders lunch, but is annoyed when the burger looks nothing like the one shown on the menu. He leaves, tries to call Beth from a phone booth, then shoots the booth to pieces after being hassled by someone who was waiting to use the phone.  Sergeant Prendergast, who is on his last day before retirement, insists on investigating the crimes. Interviews with the witnesses at each scene lead Prendergast to realize that the same person may be responsible. Foster's “D-FENS” [[vanity plate]] proves to be an important lead, because Prendergast remembers being in the same traffic jam as Foster earlier that day. Prendergast and his partner, Detective Torres, visit Foster's mother, who is surprised to learn that Foster lost his job. They realize Foster is heading toward his former family's home in Venice, Los Angeles and rush to intercept him.  Foster passes a bank where a black man is protesting outside being rejected for a loan application. The man exchanges a glance with Foster and says "don't forget me" as he is escorted away by police. Foster stops at a military surplus store to buy a new pair of shoes. The owner, a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]], diverts Torres’ attention when she comes in to ask questions. After she leaves, he offers Foster a [[M72 LAW|rocket launcher]], and congratulates him for shooting "a bunch of niggers" at the Whammy Burger. When Foster expresses distaste for the store owner's racism, the man pulls a gun, tells him he is going to jail, and attempts to handcuff him, but Foster stabs him with the gang member's knife, then shoots him. Foster changes into army fatigues and boots, takes the rocket launcher, and leaves.  Foster calls Beth from another payphone, and tells her that he is "coming home", in violation of his restraining order. Alarmed by his rambling speech and menacing manner, Beth calls the police; they send a pair of officers to her home, but they do not believe that Foster really intends to harm her, and therefore only stay for a short time.  Foster passes a construction site, which has created a [[traffic bottleneck]]. Foster accuses an insolent construction worker of doing unnecessary repairs to justify their overinflated budget. He pulls out the rocket launcher, but struggles to use it until a young boy explains how it works. Foster accidentally fires the launcher, blowing up the construction site.   Foster calls Beth and tells her that he is close to her home. Terrified, she flees with Adele. When Foster reaches the empty house, he realizes that they may have gone to nearby Venice Pier, but Prendergast and Torres arrive before he can go after them. Foster shoots and wounds Torres and flees, with Prendergast in pursuit.  At the end of the pier, Foster confronts Beth and Adele. Adele is happy to see him, but Beth believes that he has come to kill them. Prendergast arrives and intervenes. He acknowledges Foster's complaints about being ill-treated by society, but does not accept that as an excuse for his rampage. Distracting Foster, Beth kicks the gun away as Prendergast draws his revolver, insisting that Foster give himself up. Foster pulls a water gun, tricking Prendergast into [[Suicide by cop|shooting him dead]].  
Fanfan
 Alexandre ([[Vincent Perez]]) is frustrated with his fiancé, Laure ([[Marine Delterme]]), whose idea of a romantic Valentine's Day gift is a pair of slippers. The passion and magic of their initial courtship has been replaced by routine and boredom. Needing to get away, Alexandre visits the beachfront cottage of his friends, Ti (Gérard Séty) and Maude (Micheline Presle). There he meets a beautiful young woman, Fanfan ([[Sophie Marceau]]), who is Maude's granddaughter and a student at Maude's school, studying to become a [[perfumer]] or ''Nose''. Although they sleep in the same bed that night, Alexandre avoids any physical contact.  The next day they are joined by Ti and Maude, who become confidants to their guests. Fanfan takes Alexandre to an old abandoned house where they learn more about each other in the quiet comfort of her childhood "hideout". Back at his apartment, Alexandre discovers his fiancé in the bedroom dressed as an Italian call girl, hoping the charade will excite his [[libido]] and rejuvenate their relationship—but the charade does not work. Later at her parents' house, Alexandre becomes even more discouraged by Laure's father's talk of him joining the funeral business and the gloomy outlook on marriage.  Meanwhile, Fanfan confesses to a friend that she is in love with Alexandre. For Alexandre, however, things are more complicated. He explains to Ti that his past relationships have all followed the same disappointing pattern—the seduction and passion at the start is inevitably replaced with routine and boredom once a relationship becomes sexual. When asked what the alternative is, Alexandre offers his solution: [[Platonic love]]. To avoid the banality of "coupledom" in his new relationship with Fanfan, he will court her forever without ever revealing his love for her. He'll never kiss her or take their relationship to a physical level, reasoning that excitement is found in unfulfilled desire. He will stay with Laure physically, but will stay ''in love'' with Fanfan forever.  Alexandre and Fanfan meet for a date at a beautiful upscale apartment, which Alexandre says belongs to his father. While Fanfan reveals personal and intimate details about her life, Alexandre prepares all her favorite foods from childhood, and the two share a romantic evening by candlelight. The perfect evening is interrupted, however, when the apartment's owner returns home with his wife, who proceeds to call the police as Alexandre and Fanfan make their escape.  Alexandre blindfolds Fanfan and drives her to a television studio to a set designed to be Vienna in 1813. He dresses her in a ballroom gown, removes the blindfold, and they waltz together, gazing lovingly into each other's eyes. They end their magical evening with a bottle of champaigne on an imaginary balcony overlooking an imaginary Vienna, with Alexandre proposing a toast to their "friendship". Fanfan is clearly disappointed and annoyed with Alexandre's talk of "friendship", and she asks to be dropped off at the home of her friend Paul—a sculptor doing a nude study of her.  Alexandre returns home to an equally annoyed Laure, who suspects he's been with another woman. Alexandre admits it, but assures her that nothing will ever come of it. As Laure plans out their wedding, Alexandre can actually see them turning into her parents. Laure knows something is wrong, saying, "I wish I weren't yours so you would want me again." Meanwhile, Fanfan complains to Maude about Alexandre's strange behavior. Unlike Alexandre, Fanfan believes in "eternal passion for life." Fanfan learns from Maude that Alexandre has been living with Laure for five years.  Alexandre and Fanfan continue to socialize as friends, but the "friendship" only creates more frustration. They meet at a restaurant and Fanfan gives him an ultimatum: he must choose between Laure and her. While Alexandre claims to want only friendship, Fanfan knows he is attracted to her by his scent. Later when she isn't looking, Alexandre pours sleeping powder in her drink, and she falls into a deep sleep on the ride home. She wakes up on the beach at the cottage, where Alexandre watches over her and applies suntan lotion sensually on her back. Tempted by the half-naked Fanfan, he moves to kiss her when suddenly Laure arrives by boat and announces that the wedding plans are set and that she is pregnant. After congratulating the couple, Fanfan leaves in disgust.  Unable to concentrate on her studies, Fanfan fails her perfumer final exams. Meanwhile, Alexandre discovers that Laure lied about being pregnant, and after he throws away the wedding invitations, Laure calls off the wedding. Alexandre then sees Fanfan boarding a bus to Italy, and he chases after her. When he reaches the bus at the next stop, he does not get on, and the bus pulls away. Later, Ti warns him that Fanfan will not wait forever. When Alexandre learns that she will be in Italy for ten days, he sets in motion his next plan. He rents the apartment next to Fanfan's apartment, knocks out the dividing wall, and installs a two-way mirror so he can see into her apartment while remaining hidden.  Back from Italy, Fanfan and Alexandre arrange to spend the weekend at the beach cottage as friends. At the train station, however, Fanfan surprises Alexandre by bringing her sculptor friend, Paul. Clearly disappointed and jealous, Alexandre tells her that he and Laure have broken up and that her pregnancy was a lie. Fanfan simply responds, "Too late." At the beach, Paul announces that he and Fanfan are getting married, but back at the apartment, Alexandre discovers through the two-way mirror that their wedding plans were just a ruse to make Alexandre jealous, and that Fanfan is still in love with him.  Later, after learning about the two-way mirror, Fanfan confronts Alexandre who is hidden behind the mirror. He confesses he did not get on the bus to Italy that day because he knew that in five years he would no longer be running after the bus. They kiss and embrace each other tenderly through the glass, but Fanfan says she needs more. "I need to feel you in me," she says, but Alexandre cannot respond. Exasperated, Fanfan gives him another ultimatum: if he is not in her room by 10:00 pm, he'll never see her again. Alexandre does not show, and when he returns to his apartment, he sees that she's moved out and left a note that she is going to see her sister. Devastated that she's gone, Alexandre calls Maude only to find out that Fanfan's sister is dead, and she could not see her other than by committing suicide. Alexandre envisions trying to get to Fanfan through endless bridal veil, and cries for being too late to touch her living body. Just then the mirror is cracked—Fanfan has broken the wall of glass between them. The two kiss and embrace, and Fanfan tells him he has until the morning to win her back.

Immediately after the crash, Max, one of the plane's few survivors, rents a car and drives from the crash site in [[Bakersfield]] to Los Angeles, stopping on the way to visit his old high school sweetheart, Alison ([[Debra Monk]]), whom he hasn't seen in 20 years. During their meal at a restaurant Alison notices Max eating a strawberry and inquires about his [[food allergy|allergy]] to them. Max grins and explains he's "gotten past" his allergic reaction and somehow, confidently finishes it with no problems. He's tracked down at a hotel room the next morning by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|F.B.I.]] agents who question his odd choice to not contact his wife and family or remain at the crash site with the other survivors. The airline sends a representative who compensates him with train tickets to go home to San Francisco. Max declines the tickets, stating adamantly that he wants to fly home and has no fear of air travel anymore. On the flight he meets Dr. Bill Perlman ([[John Turturro]]), an airline-contracted [[psychiatrist]] who offers to counsel Max for [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].  Dr. Perlman accompanies Max back to his home where his wife Laura ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) begins noticing his strange behavior. Max matter-of-factly tells Nan Gordon ([[Deirdre O'Connell (actress)|Deirdre O'Connell]]), the wife of his friend and business partner, that her husband Jeff ([[John de Lancie]]) died in the crash. The media dubs Max "The Good Samaritan" and tries to interview him as Byron comes to publicly thank him for the way he comforted the passengers during the crash, but Max avoids making a statement. Over time Max becomes distant from Laura and his son Jonah (Spencer Vrooman) because of his preoccupation with his near death experience. He begins drawing abstract pictures of the crash and his sense of a hole opening in the sky before him.  He comes to think of himself as invulnerable to death causing Dr. Perlman to become concerned that Max is [[delusion]]al. Perlman encourages Max to meet with another survivor, Carla Rodrigo ([[Rosie Perez]]), in the hope that the two can help support one another. Carla, who lost her baby son in the crash, struggles with [[Survivor guilt|survivor's guilt]], punishing herself for not holding onto him tightly enough when his seat belt on the plane malfunctioned. Max and Carla bond and develop a close friendship as he helps her to get past her depression and free herself from her guilt.  Max, Laura and Nan meet with attorney Steven Brillstein ([[Tom Hulce]]), who encourages Max to exaggerate his testimony in order to increase Nan's [[settlement offer|compensation settlement offer]] from the airline. Max states his discomfort with lying but reluctantly agrees when he considers Nan's financial predicament as a [[widow]]. The unease of lying causes Max to have a [[panic attack]] and he runs out of the office to the roof of the building where he climbs onto the ledge. As Max stands on the ledge, looking down at the streets below, his panic attack subsides and he rejoices in his fearlessness. Laura follows Max onto the roof and upon finding him, blindly spinning around on the ledge with his overcoat billowing across his face, she believes him to be [[Suicide crisis|suicidal]].  Eventually Max's increasingly dramatic attempts (culminating with an intentional car crash into a brick wall) at pushing the boundaries between life and death succeed in jolting Carla from her uncertain state. Afterwards, Carla meets with Laura and the two clarify the misunderstanding that she and Max are past a co-dependency state and are in fact, in love with each other. Moreover, Carla explains that she regards Max as he sees himself - an angel - and Laura now understands their shared delusion. However, after Carla reluctantly parts company with Max, he remains aloof in his relationship with his wife and son, struggling to come to terms with his implied immortality. One night, Brillstein arrives at the Klein home to celebrate the pending settlement offer, and brings a basket with an assortment of fruits. Max eats one of the strawberries but, unlike at the restaurant, this time he experiences an immediate allergic reaction and suffocates. As he lies choking, Max goes into a state of vision where he sees various flashbacks and starts toward the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel (in the guise of an aisle in the airplane fuselage) as Laura's voice is overheard repeatedly "calling him back" to the world. Max accepts the reality of his imminent death when suddenly he's [[Artificial respiration|resuscitated]] by Laura. He survives and (it's implied) recovers his emotional connection to his family, to the world and to the reality of yet another chance at life.  
Farewell My Concubine (film)
  As the film opens, a street crowd watches a troupe of boys perform Peking opera, supervised by their aging director, Master Guan. When one of the boys, Laizi attempts to run away, another boy performer Shitou (literally meaning "stone") placates the crowd by breaking a brick on his head; the crowd cheers, but Shitou is later punished for the stunt.  A prostitute begs Master Guan to accept her son in the troupe. Master Guan initially objects him because of his [[Polydactyly|superfluous finger]]. She then uses a cleaver to cut her son's superfluous finger and manages to sign the contract. Shitou welcomes the newcomer as "Douzi" (literally meaning "bean"), and the two boys become friends.  A few years pass. Laizi and Douzi run away as they cannot bear the toughness of the training. When they are on the street, they witness a performance by an opera master that inspires them to return to the troupe. They find Shitou being beaten for allowing their escape, and Douzi accepts his punishment as Master Guan beats him mercilessly. Shitou tries to intervene, when an assistant informs them that Laizi has hanged himself.  Douzi attaches himself to Shitou and is trained to play [[Dan (Chinese opera)|''dan'' (female) roles]]. Shitou learns the [[Peking opera#Four main roles|''jing'']], a type of painted-face male leading role. When Douzi practises the line "I am by nature a girl, not a boy"  in  "Dreaming of the World Outside the Nunnery", he keeps mistakes the line into "I am by nature a boy...". When he repeats this mistake in front of an agent who might fund the troupe, Shitou viciously jams Master Guan's brass tobacco pipe in Douzi's mouth as punishment,<ref name="Canby"/> causing his mouth to bleed. Douzi looks dazed, but whispers, "I am by nature a girl... not a boy." The troupe cheer, having secured the agent.<ref></ref>  The eunuch Zhang appreciates their performance and summons Shitou and Douzi for an audience. Shitou admires a beautiful sword in Zhang's collection, stating that if he were emperor, Douzi would be his queen. Douzi responds that one day he hopes to give Shitou a sword like that. Douzi is to meet Zhang alone, and catches him in a lascivious embrace with a young girl. Douzi is afraid as the man eyes him up and down, and seeks to be with Shitou, but Zhang catches him and pushes him to the ground. Hours later he emerges, and Shitou cannot get him to say a word. It is clear that Douzi has been sexually assaulted. On their way home, Douzi spies an abandoned baby, and despite Master Guan's urging that "we each have our own fate (''[[yuanfen]]'')" Douzi adopts the baby and eventually Master Guan trains him. [[File:HKCL CWB Red Mission 張國榮歌影迷國際聯盟 Leslie Cheung's Movies 霸王別姬電影 Farewell My Concubine clothing Apr-2013.JPG|thumb|Memorabilia from the film exhibited at "The Art of Leslie Cheung's Movie Images", April 2013, [[Hong Kong Central Library]].]]  Douzi and Shitou become Peking opera stars under the stage names Cheng Dieyi and Duan Xiaolou. One of their hit performances is the play [[Farewell My Concubine (play)|Farewell My Concubine]] where Dieyi plays the concubine [[Consort Yu]] and Xiaolou plays the romantic hero [[Xiangyu]]. The adult Dieyi is in love with Xiaolou, but the sexual aspects of his affection are not returned. A patron, Yuan Shiqing, slowly courts Dieyi. Xiaolou takes a liking to Juxian, a headstrong courtesan at the upscale House of Blossoms. Xiaolou intervenes when a mob of drunk men harass Juxian and says that they are announcing their engagement. Juxian later buys her freedom from her own savings and, deceiving him into thinking she was thrown out, pressures Xiaolou to keep his word. When Xiaolou announces their engagement, Dieyi and Xiaolou have a falling-out. Dieyi calls her "''[[Pan Jinlian]]''" (a "dragon lady" from the novel ''[[Jin Ping Mei|Golden Lotus]]''). Dieyi takes up with Master Yuan, who gives him Zhang's sword. An aged Master Guan shames them into re-forming the troupe.  The complex relationship between these three characters is then tested in the succession of political upheavals that encompass China from the onset of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The film also follows the fates of Na Kun, who turns his theater troupe over to the new government after 1949, and the abandoned baby, called "Xiao Si" (literally meaning "little fourth brother"), who is trained in ''dan'' roles. Xiao Si and Douzi have an argument about the physical punishments in the training, at the end of which Xiao Si threatens revenge. At a performance of the play Farewell My Concubine, the role of the Consort Yu is usurped by Xiao Si with Xiaolou's complicity. Betrayed, Dieyi leaves and becomes addicted to opium. Later, Xiaolou and Juxian helps him to recover and the troupe surrounds him to congratulate his return to health.  On the eve of the [[Cultural Revolution]], Shitou and Juxian are seen burning now-[[contraband]] literature and clothing. They make love with Dieyi witnessing from the window. The scene shifts to Shitou being questioned by the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] on a few allegedly unpatriotic words he said years ago. Xiao Si is seen in the background, seemingly in a position of power. The entire opera troupe is taken out in public for a humiliating [[struggle session]] by the [[Red Guards]]. Under duress, Shitou confesses that Douzi performed for the Japanese army and may have had a relationship with Yuan Shiqing. Enraged, Douzi tells the mob that Juxian was a prostitute. Shitou is forced to admit that he married a prostitute but swears that he doesn't love her and will never see her again. Juxian is crushed to hear his words and commits suicide. Xiao Si is seen in a gym practising Consort Yu's role, happy over having usurped Douzi's position, but the group of Red Guards catches him in the act and his fate is unclear.  The film then jumps to Douzi and Shitou's reunion in 1977. They are practising ''Farewell My Concubine'', and their relationship seems to have mended since the tribunal and suicide of Shitou's wife. They exchange a smile and Shitou begins with the line that gave Douzi trouble forty years ago. Douzi makes the same error of finishing the line with "I am not a girl". Shitou corrects him and they continue practising. Douzi then commits suicide using the sword in the play.  
Fear of a Black Hat
 The film is a comedic [[mockumentary]] depicting the perspective of a filmmaker as she trails a hardcore [[gangsta rap]] group called N.W.H. ("Niggaz With Hats"), a play on the name of the popular group [[N.W.A]] In many ways, ''Fear of a Black Hat'' is similar to the [[satire|satirical]] film about early 1980s [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] ''[[This is Spinal Tap]]''.  The members of N.W.H. are: *Ice Cold (Cundieff), the main rapper and the intelligent and vulgar backbone of the group.  *Tasty Taste ([[Larry B. Scott]]), the ultra-violent secondary rapper who always seems to be armed with a variety of dangerous assault weaponry.  (His name is spelled "Tasty-Taste" in the credits but not in other parts of the movie.) *Tone Def ([[Mark Christopher Lawrence]]), the [[esotericism|esoteric]] [[Disc jockey#Hip Hop disc jockeys|D.J.]], who is talented enough to scratch with his butt and his penis (the latter is not shown directly, but strongly and humorously implied).  (His name is spelled "Tone-Def" in the credits but not in other parts of the movie.)  The film is told from the point of view of Nina Blackburn ([[Kasi Lemmons]]), a [[sociologist]] who analyzes hip hop as a form of [[communication]] for her degree. She chooses N.W.H. as the subject of her [[thesis]] and follows them around for a year. She familiarizes herself with the band members, their beliefs, and their often strange behavior.  The members wear outrageous headwear during their performances. This is explained as an act of rebellion, remembering their [[slavery|slave]] ancestors, who had to work bare-headed in the sun. According to N.W.H., hats are a symbol for resistance and revolution since their hatless ancestors were too tired from working all day in the sun to revolt. This is a typical example of the bizarre logic the group uses to explain the deeper meanings behind their otherwise crude and base music and images.  A steady source of comedy is N.W.H.'s use of over-the-top graphic language (e.g. sex, violence and rantings against the police), which detractors see as a cheap means to sell records, but in their eyes is essential to convey a "socially relevant message". They offer jaw-dropping explanations why songs such as "Booty Juice" and "Come and Pet the P.U.S.S.Y." are in fact deep and socially significant, and that detractors obviously do not truly understand the "real meaning". Throughout the movie, it is difficult to tell if the members of N.W.H. truly believe what they are saying, or are just portraying an image.  A lot of time also goes into describing N.W.H.'s feud with another rap group, the Jam Boys. The groups constantly insult and discredit each other, even sometimes resulting in brandishing weapons. At one point, N.W.H. brings to light evidence that the Jam Boys' lead rapper attended a prep school, directly threatening his [[credibility|street credibility]].  A [[macabre]] running gag—inspired by ''This is Spinal Tap''—involves their white managers dying under mysterious circumstances (the group originally insist that they "wasn't in town when the shit happened"). They explain to Nina that their first few managers were black—in fact, were their relatives—and that they decided switching to white managers would be better for their families and the black community.  N.W.H.'s internal matters turn sour when Ice Cold cuts down his involvement because he wants to participate in a film, and Cheryl C. ([[Rose Jackson (actress)|Rose Jackson]]), a [[groupie]], hooks up with Tasty-Taste. Although she is clearly more interested in his money than in him, Tasty lets her take over his life. When Tasty finds Cheryl and Ice Cold in bed, N.W.H. is no more.  The group breaks up and each member launches a solo career. Ice dedicates himself to [[house music]]; Tasty brings out a [[wikt:diss song|diss track]] in which he curses Ice; and Tone Def becomes a [[hippie]] (with obvious references to "flower rappers," such as [[P.M. Dawn]]). None sees much success until they ultimately reunite for a triumphant comeback in which their differences have been set aside, at least for the time being.

While at a custody hearing, Jack realizes what's going on by seeing a line of kids handcuffed and chained together in a line, and decides to break Eddie out of Bigelow. First Jack tries to dump them with his mother in [[Las Vegas]], but she is a gambler and a cheat, so the cops are after her, too. His mother later reminds him that they are his kids and that they're his responsibility. After leaving they go to the [[Hoover Dam]], at Eddie's request, but the police soon arrive. As the police approach the kids, Jack drives his empty car off a cliff, to cause a distraction and plan an escape. He takes the kids to [[New Orleans]] with him, where he plans to pull off a big heist that could set them up for life.

Fire in the Sky
 On November 5, 1975 in [[Snowflake, Arizona]], [[lumberjack|logger]] [[Travis Walton UFO incident|Travis Walton]] ([[D. B. Sweeney]]), and his co-workers—Mike Rogers ([[Robert Patrick]]), Allan Dallis ([[Craig Sheffer]]), David Whitlock ([[Peter Berg]]), Greg Hayes ([[Henry Thomas]]) and Bobby Cogdill ([[Bradley Gregg]])—head to work in the [[White Mountains (Arizona)|White Mountains]].  Driving home from work, the men come across an [[unidentified flying object]]. Curious to learn more, Walton gets out of the truck and is struck by a bright beam of light from the object and is sent flying several feet backwards as if pushed by an unseen force. Fearing Walton was just killed, the others flee the scene. Rogers decides to go back to the spot to retrieve Walton, but he is nowhere to be found. Making their way back to town to report the incident, the loggers are met with skepticism, as they relate what sounds like a [[tall tale]] to Sheriff Blake Davis ([[Noble Willingham]]) and Lieutenant Frank Watters ([[James Garner]]). They are suspected of [[wikt:foul play|foul play]] despite no apparent motive or knowledge of Walton's whereabouts.  After interviewing the men, Lieutenant Watters realizes there is a great deal of tension between Walton and Dallis, leading him to believe this might be a murder investigation. The Lieutenant also discovers a [[tabloid newspaper]] in their truck with headlines about [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]], hinting that they used the article to concoct their story. The men are accused of murder and are threatened by Travis' brother Dan Walton ([[Scott MacDonald (actor)|Scott MacDonald]]). The men are offered a [[polygraph|lie detector]] test and take it. After the testing is complete, Rogers is outraged that the results are not shared and he and his guys refuse to come back the next day to take it again. However, after the men leave, the man who administered the tests tells the Sheriff and Lieutenant that with the exception of Dallis' test (which was inconclusive), the other men seem to be telling the truth.  Five days later, Rogers receives a call from someone claiming to be Walton. He is found at a [[Heber-Overgaard, Arizona|Heber]] gas station, alive but naked, [[dehydration|dehydrated]] and incoherent. A [[ufology|ufologist]] questions Walton but he is thrown out and Walton is taken to a hospital. Rogers visits Walton while in the emergency room and ends up telling Walton that he left him after he was struck by the light but came back to get him. Walton appears very angry by this and turns away from Rogers who blames the whole incident on Walton for getting out of the truck. During a welcome home party, Walton suffers a [[flashback (psychology)|flashback]] of the abduction by the extraterrestrials.  In his flashback, he awakens inside a slimy cocoon. Breaking out of its membrane, he finds himself in a zero-gravity environment inside a cylindrical enclosure whose walls contain other similar cocoons and he is horrified to inadvertently discover that one contains the decomposing remains of a human body that has apparently been dissected and is still semi-conscious. As he makes his way to a neighboring area featuring what appear to be several humanoid space suits, he is apprehended by two extraterrestrial creatures. He is unwillingly hauled down corridors full of terrestrial detritus such as shoes and keys before arriving in a bizarre examination room. The aliens strip him of his clothes and cover him with an elastic material that pins him painfully to a raised platform under an array of equipment and lights in the middle of the room. Despite Walton's terrified screams, the aliens pitilessly subject him to a traumatic, excruciating experiment in which a gelatinous substance is shoved into his mouth, his jaw is clamped open, a device is inserted into his neck and he is forced to endure an ocular probe while fully conscious during the experience. Afterwards, Walton loses consciousness until finding himself back on Earth disoriented, abused, and severely traumatized.  While interviewing Walton, Lieutenant Watters expresses his doubts about the abduction, believing it as merely a hoax. He notes Walton's newfound celebrity because of the tabloids' attempts to profit from his tale. The film culminates with a denouement between Walton and Rogers. The closing titles state that in 1993, the loggers were resubmitted to additional polygraph examinations, which they passed, corroborating their innocence.  
Flesh and Bone (film)

The Firm (1993 film)
 [[Mitch McDeere]] ([[Tom Cruise]]) is a young man from an impoverished background, but with a promising future as a lawyer. About to graduate from [[Harvard Law School]] near the top of his class, he receives a generous job offer from  Bendini, Lambert & Locke, a small boutique firm in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] specializing in accounting and tax law. He and his wife, [[Abby McDeere|Abby]] ([[Jeanne Tripplehorn]]), move to [[Memphis]] and Mitch sets to work studying to pass the Tennessee [[bar exam]]. Avery Tolar ([[Gene Hackman]]), one of the firm's senior partners, becomes his mentor and begins introducing Mitch to BL&L's professional culture, which demands complete loyalty, strict confidentiality, and a willingness to charge exceptional fees for their services. Seduced by the money and perks showered on him, including a house and car, he is at first totally oblivious to the more sinister side of his new employer, although Abby has her suspicions.  Mitch passes the bar exam and begins working long hours that put a strain on his marriage. Working closely with Avery, Mitch learns that most of the firm's work involves helping wealthy clients hide large amounts of money in off-shore shell corporations and other dubious tax-avoidance schemes. While on a trip to the [[Cayman Islands]] on behalf of a client, Mitch is seduced by a local woman and cheats on Abby. Unbeknownst to Mitch, this encounter has been arranged by the firm's sinister security chief, Bill DeVasher ([[Wilford Brimley]]), who later uses photos of Mitch's beach tryst with the woman as blackmail to keep him quiet about the firm's questionable, even illegal, activities.  Mitch realizes he is now trapped, but after two associates of the firm die under mysterious circumstances, he is approached by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents who inform him that while some of BL&L's business is legitimate, their biggest client is the Morolto [[American Mafia|Mafia]] family from Chicago. The firm's partners, as well as most of the associates, are all complicit in a massive tax fraud and [[Money laundering|money-laundering]] scheme. The two associates who died had learned about the firm's dark side, and were killed to keep them from talking. The FBI agents warn Mitch that his house, car, and office have probably all been bugged. The FBI pressures Mitch to provide the Bureau with evidence they can use to go after the Moroltos and bring down BL&L.  Mitch knows he faces a stark choice. If he works with the FBI, he believes that even if he stays alive, he will have to disclose information about the firm's legitimate clients—thus breaking the [[attorney–client privilege]] and risking [[disbarment]]. However, the FBI warns him that if he stays with the firm, he will almost certainly go to jail when the FBI takes down both the firm and the Moroltos. Either way, his life as he knows it is over, and he agrees to cooperate with the FBI in return for $1.5 million and the release of his imprisoned brother Ray in Arkansas.  Desperate to find a way out, Mitch inadvertently stumbles on a solution when one of his clients complains that he was billed for an extra several hours of fees, as part of the firm's money-laundering services for the Moroltos. Mailing these padded bills to the firm's clients is considered to be [[Mail and wire fraud|mail fraud]], which would expose the firm to [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]] charges. Mitch begins secretly copying the firm's billing records, but he is unmasked when a prison guard on the Moroltos' payroll alerts DeVasher after Mitch's brother Ray is transferred to FBI custody without the usual formalities being followed.  Evading DeVasher and his thugs, Mitch meets with the Morolto brothers and, presenting himself as a loyal attorney looking out for his clients' best interests, tells them that his contact with the FBI and his copying of the firm's files were merely an attempt to expose the firm's illegal overbilling. Mitch asks the Moroltos for permission to turn over their billing invoices in order to help the FBI make their case against the firm. He reveals that he has made his own copies of the files, but assures them that as long as he is alive, any other information he knows about their legal affairs is covered under attorney-client privilege and will never be revealed. Convinced thus, the Moroltos agree to guarantee Mitch's safety and let him give the FBI all the evidence it needs to prosecute the firm. Since the attorney-client privilege doesn't apply when a lawyer knows about ongoing criminal activity, Mitch is able to keep his status as a lawyer.  The film ends as the McDeeres leave their house in Memphis and return to [[Boston]], driving the same well-used car in which they arrived in Memphis.  
First Shot (1993 film)

Flirting Scholar
 In the [[Ming Dynasty]], there were [[Four Masters of the Ming dynasty|four scholars]], whose literary and artistic skills are unmatched in China. [[Tang Yin|Tong Pak Fu]] ([[Stephen Chow]]) is the most famous, for having eight wives in addition to his expertise as an artist, [[Chinese poetry|poet]], and [[Chinese calligraphy|calligrapher]]. However, Tong's wives are all gambling addicts, unappreciative of Tong's artistic skills. This leads to Tong's quest for a woman who truly appreciates his strengths.  The Tong Family have been generations of martial arts masters and has two major enemies: the Evil Scholar, a notorious swordsman known for The Deadly Scholastic Sword (書生奪命劍), and an evil ex-girlfriend of his father. Due to these rivalries, Tong Pak Fu is forbidden by his mother to use any form of martial arts.  One day, Tong stumbles upon the convoy of the House of Wah, and meets Chow Heung ([[Gong Li]]), one of the four maids in the House of Wah. This chance encounter convinces Tong that he has finally found his true love. On the advice of a boatman, Tong pretends to be a lowly servant in order to gain employment in the House of Wah.  Tong finds life as a servant very difficult, until after a night incident (which involved the saving of Chow Heung from rape by the Wolf gang), Madame Wah ([[Cheng Pei-pei]]) discovers that Tong is actually educated. After some persuasion by Chow Heung, Tong is hired as an assistant tutor for Madame Wah's two young sons.  After the accidental death of the main tutor of the House of Wah, Tong is promoted as senior tutor and manages to get closer to Chow Heung. However, the House of Wah is suddenly visited by Chancellor Wah's political rival, Prince Ning, who is planning a [[coup d'état|coup]]. The visit goes violent as the Evil Scholar, now a subordinate under Prince Ning, fights Madam Wah. Madame Wah is injured, and Tong steps in to finish the battle in the House of Wah's favor. Prince Ning seizes the opportunity to blame the House of Wah for insulting him. Embarrassed at being utterly defeated at the hands of a tutor, Prince Ning leaves hastily, vowing revenge. In reproducing a painting, Tong reveals his real identity to Madame Wah, who is revealed as the former love rival of Tong's mother and still hold grudges against his father.  Several days later, the Evil Scholar returns to annihilate the entire House of Wah. Madame Wah attempts to defend the family, but is almost killed. Tong appears and after a fierce battle, Tong kills the Evil Scholar and earns Chow Heung's hand in marriage as a reward. Tong then discovers that Chow Heung is just as much a gambling addict as his previous eight wives.

Doug pretends to date Andy so that she can get close to Christian without his wife suspecting.  Doug learns that Christian is deceiving Andy about getting a divorce. But because his hotel proposal is urgent and Andy is old enough to make her own decisions, he doesn't intervene. However, as he and Andy spend time together, he develops feelings for her.  Andy learns that a document Christian has asked Doug to sign was intended to permit the billionaire to take over the hotel project and force Doug out. Christian reveals that an IRS agent who was tailing Doug about the real estate property he (Doug) bought until he (Christian) and his lawyers took care of it was actually working with Christian to get the property. Christian smugly tells Andy that the project was going to make a fortune and he wasn't going to share it with a mere concierge. Andy abandons him for Doug, who is chasing after her. After the two reunite at the Queensboro Bridge and reveal to each other about the deception, Doug never signed the document, so Christian can't take over the property.  In the end, after Doug and Andy marry, he gets a call from Harry Wegman, who has accidentally been sent Doug's business plan by a senile member of the hotel staff Doug refused to fire and has decided to put up the $3 million that Doug needs.  
Fong Sai-yuk II
 [[Fong Sai-yuk]] and his wife, Ting-ting, are now full-fledged members of the [[The Book and the Sword|Red Flower Society]], which is led by Fong's godfather, [[List of The Book and the Sword characters|Chan Ka-lok]], who intends to groom Fong to become his successor. Chan's deputy, the ruthless Yu Chun-hoi, stands in Fong's way and tries to harm him. The society's members are unaware that Chan is actually the younger brother of the [[Qianlong Emperor]], and might renounce their loyalty to him if they discover his true identity. Meanwhile, some Japanese [[rōnin]] find evidence of Chan's background and attempt to pass it to the Qianlong Emperor.  Chan sends Fong to intercept the rōnin and retrieve the evidence, but Fong is distracted by a damsel in distress and focuses on rescuing her instead. At a critical moment, when Fong is almost killed by the rōnin, his mother, Miu Tsui-fa, shows up and saves him. Despite so, the rōnin get away and pass the evidence to [[Sun Shiyi|Suen Si-ngai]], the Viceroy of Guangdong province. The woman whom Fong rescued earlier is Suen On-yee, the viceroy's daughter. Chan plans for Fong to enter a martial arts contest to win On-yee's hand in marriage and use the opportunity to steal the evidence from the viceroy. On-yee has already fallen in love with Fong and marries him for real, much to Ting-ting's unhappiness. However, the viceroy is aware of Fong's true intention so he sets a trap for Fong. On-yee manages to persuade her father to release Fong by threatening to commit suicide.  Fong returns to the Red Flower Society and admits that he has failed in his mission. Since he had made a promise earlier that he will permanently disable himself if he fails the mission, Yu Chun-hoi forces Chan to abide by the agreement so Chan cripples Fong, rendering him unable to practise martial arts again. While Fong recovers, Yu incites the society's members to turn against Chan and seizes the leadership position. Yu then sends his men to kill Fong in order to silence him. Fong manages to escape but his mother is captured by Yu. To save his mother, Fong returns and fights his way through, blindfolding himself so that he will not see his former fellows spilling blood. It turns out that Chan had actually pretended to disable Fong. Fong confronts Yu, kills him after an intense fight. He saves his godfather from prison and restores him to the leadership position. By the end of the film, Fong's two wives have come to terms with each other, such that they can talk and behave in absolute unison. Fong decides to retire from the martial artists' community and spend the rest of his life with his family.  
Flying Dagger
 The Hon [Dagger] Brothers, Chung and Lam, who are in fact uncle and nephew, are rival bounty hunters to the Fung [Bewitchment] Sisters, and take glee in thwarting each other because Chung refused to marry Lady Fung. Fung Ling and Lam are also in love, but do not acknowledge it.  Emperor Tsao hires the Hons to capture the Nine-Tails Fox, whom he claims has made a major robbery of his household, including the rape and murder of his daughter and the murder of 41 servants. The Hons are distracted when they find the Fungs captured by Never Die and his brothers, who in spite of decapitation and loss of a hand, proceed to chase the Hons (the severed hand grabbing at one of them) to the lair of Nine-Tails Fox, who has recently caused his wife, the [[apsara]] known as Flying Cat to walk out on him. The group discovers that Never Die is allergic to glib talk, and begin speaking to each other glibly. Chung, too embarrassed to speak to Lady Fung in that way, instead speak to Nine-Tails Fox, the two pulling off each other shirts, and trap Never Die, where he soon dissolves. The four bounty hunters and Never Die's hand escorts Nine-Tails Fox away. Flying Cat returns to find drawn images of what has gone on previously, including what she interprets as her husband's homosexual behavior, and chastises the old man who sends the drawings out through a slot for not intervening, which he says is not his place.  Nine-Tails Fox, who proudly admits to being a thief but insists he never hurts anyone, escapes from the bounty hunters to the inn of Pang Tin-hong, where he becomes involved with numerous courtesans. The bounty hunters follow him, but not before Flying Cat catches up with him. Still other bounty hunters, including the burly Western Ace, a gay man who sings 1980s American pop tunes, and a transsexual who delivers poisoned kisses, arrive at the inn. Because the Hons and Fungs pay well and are supported by the police, Pang sides with them against the new bounty hunters, claiming that he and his wife are [[Leslie Cheung]] and [[Anita Mui]]. The transsexual kisses Chung, causing him to turn green and infect him with poison. After the other bounty hunters are defeated, Pang sends Lam and Ling outside, insisting that they are under eighteen, although both claim to be eighteen, in order to explain that the cure for the poison is to have sex nine times, then eat the strange fetus that will be born three days later. Chung tries to take Lady Fung to bed, but inadvertently passes the disease to Pang, whose wife and he fight a lot and never want it at the same time.  While Ling and Lam are outside, Never Die's hand grabs Ling's shoulder, and she thinks it is Lam's and rests her head on his shoulder. Thus distracted, Tsao captures the two of them, and the thieves and the bounty hunters team up against their common enemy and rescue the young ones.  At the end of the film, Lady Fung gives birth to the strange fetus, and the Hons, Fungs, Fox, Cat, and Pang seemingly forgetting about the idea that it is to be eaten and ready and excited to receive it as if a normal birth, are horrified to see that the baby is in fact Never Die.

For the Moment (film)
 In the summer of 1942, something is dramatically changing for the small community of [[Brandon, Manitoba]] as hundreds of young men from all over the world descend on this sleepy hamlet. In this newly found excitement of meeting newcomers, Lill (Christianne Hirt), a young prairie farm wife whose husband is already overseas for two years, and [[Leading aircraftman|LAC]] Lachlan Curry (Russell Crowe), a gallant Australian airman are fated to meet. He has come to train at the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] air base nearby to become a pilot. His friend, LAC Johnny Crouch (Peter Outerbridge) who has struck up a relationship with Lill's younger sister, Kate (Sara McMillan), introduces Lachlan to Lill.  During a languid moment, Lachlan recites to Lill the poem, "High Flight" by fellow airman, [[John Gillespie Magee, Jr.]] which epitomizes what he is going through in his training. Lill recognizes the poem as it had been widely distributed after the death of the young airman who had penned it. The young lovers also have a kinship with another unlikely pairing, Betsy (Wanda Cannon), a bootlegging charmer who sells more than alcohol and also has a husband away in the army and two children to look after, and Zeek Williams (Scott Kraft), the flying station's chief flight instructor from Chicago.  The short period that they have together is punctuated by the strain of dangerous wartime training and their inevitable realization that there is little time left for them. Lachlan has to deal with death from all sides, first when "Scotty" (Robert G. Slade), the trainee who bunks next to him, commits suicide. More devastating is the death of Lill's brother, Dennis (Kelly Proctor) that leads her to a fateful decision to end their relationship, and her sister to cancel wedding plans. When Zeek crashes on the edge of the field, he extracts a cruel promise from Lachlan who later seeks out Betsy to tell her what he had to do. At the wings parade, a farewell to the trainees who have earned their wings who will be shortly sent off to war, Lachlan and Lill are unable to reconcile, but Kate remains true to Johnny, saying she will be there when he comes back. Across the parade square, Lachlan and Lill share a final moment, saying goodbye quietly, with a phrase he has taught her, "Fair dinkum."

On the way back from the camp, the convoy of vehicles carrying the participants is surprised by a [[Flash flood]] when crossing the river Guadalupe, near the city of [[San Antonio]]. A bus and a van lie in the middle of the river. The young are forced to hurry out of these two vehicles, and are swept away by the current. In the midst of chaos, the young have to fight to survive, while the rescue teams struggle against time to try to save them. Even a TV helicopter is employed in the rescue.  
Free Willy
  The film begins with a pod of [[orca]]s swimming near the coastline of the [[Pacific Northwest]]. The pod is tracked down by a group of [[whaler]]s, and one of them, Willy, is trapped and sent to an amusement park.  Sometime later in [[Seattle, Washington]], Jesse, a 12-year-old boy abandoned by his mother six years before, is caught by the police for stealing food and vandalizing the theme park. Jesse's social worker Dwight earns him a reprieve by finding him a foster home and having him clean up the graffiti at the theme park as part of his probation. His foster parents are the supportive and kind Annie and Glen Greenwood, but Jesse is initially unruly and hostile to them.  While working at the park, Jesse encounters Willy. Willy is regarded as surly and uncooperative by the park staff, including his trainer Rae Lindley, but he saves Jesse from drowning, starting a bond, and becomes friendly with his keeper, [[Haida people|Haida]] native Randolph Johnson. Jesse teaches tricks to Willy, and is offered a permanent job at the theme park after probation. Jesse also warms into his new home.  The owner of the amusement park, Dial, sees the talent Jesse and Willy have together and makes plans to host "The Willy Show" in hopes of finally making money from Willy, who has thus far been a costly venture for him. On the day of the first performance, Willy is antagonized by children banging constantly on his underwater observation area and refuses to perform. In a stress-induced rage, he smashes against the tank, damaging it. Jesse storms off in tears and plans to run away. Later, while at the tank, Jesse notices Willy's family calling to him from the ocean and realizes how miserable he is in captivity. Shortly after, Jesse spots Dial's assistant, Wade, and several other henchmen sneaking into the underwater observation area. They damage the tank enough that the water will gradually leak out and kill Willy, allowing them to cash in on his $1,000,000 insurance policy.  Jesse, Randolph, and Rae hatch a plan to release Willy back into the ocean. They use equipment at the park to load Willy onto a trailer, and Jesse and Randolph use Glen's truck to tow Willy to a marina. They try to stay on the back roads to avoid being spotted, but eventually get stuck in the mud. Wade meanwhile informs Dial that Willy is missing, and launches a search to find the fugitives.  Unable to move the trailer himself, Jesse calls Glen and Annie using a [[CB radio]] in Glen's truck. Annie and Glen show up and help free the truck, and continue on to the marina to release Willy. Dial knows where they are headed, and when they show up, he, Wade, and his henchmen are blocking the gate. Glen charges at them full speed in the truck, forcing the henchmen to scatter. Glen smashes through the gate, turns the truck around and backs Willy into the water, flooding his truck in the process.  Willy is finally released into the water but does not immediately move, seemingly having been on dry land for too long. Dial and his goons attempt to stop them, but Jesse and his friends fight back, trying to hold them off long enough for Willy to swim away. With Jesse's encouragement, Willy finally begins to swim, slipping away from the battle and heading for the marina entrance. Before he can make it into the ocean, however, two of Dial's whaling ships suddenly appear, sealing off the marina with their nets. Jesse runs towards the [[seawall]], calling for Willy to follow him, drawing him away from the boats. Jesse goes to the edge and tells Willy that if he makes the jump, it will be his highest, and he'll be free. Jesse says a tearful goodbye, but pulls himself together and goes back to the top. He recites a Haida prayer Randolph had taught him, before giving Willy a signal. Willy makes the jump over the seawall and lands in the ocean on the other side, finally free to return to his family. Jesse goes back to Glen and Annie, who hug him as they look out into the sea. Willy calls out to Jesse in the distance, and both say their farewell.  
Freaked
 Skye Daley ([[Brooke Shields]]) is interviewing beloved former child star Ricky Coogin ([[Alex Winter]]). Rather bluntly, Skye asks how Ricky so quickly went from one of America's sweethearts to a name that makes children scream in terror.  It all began when he accepted a job from the slimy mega-corporation E.E.S. to promote "Zygrot 24", a controversial and lethal toxic fertilizer, in South America. Although hesitant at first, the greedy, self-centered Coogin caves in after their sleazy chairman ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]) offers him $5,000,000 and he hops on the first plane to South America with his buddy Ernie ([[Michael Stoyanov]]). During their flight, the duo have a run-in with Ricky's 12-year old number one fan Stuey Gluck ([[Alex Zuckerman]]).  Once Ricky and Ernie arrive in the country of Santa Flan, they cross paths with a group of protesters, specifically the hard-willed and attractive young [[environmentalist]] Julie ([[Megan Ward]]). The two con Julie into thinking they're also environmentalists and she agrees to join them on a trip to an anti-Zygrot 24 protest. However, she soon finds out their true identities and the three are stuck with each other for the rest of the drive. They decide to take a detour to see Freek Land, a [[freak show]], and they wind up in the clutches of demented proprietor Elijah C. Skuggs ([[Randy Quaid]]) and his henchman, the long-tongued Toad ([[Jaime Cardriche]]). Skuggs introduces them to his "''Tasty Freekz Machine''", a contraption powered by Zygrot 24 that morphs regular people into "''Hideous Mutant Freekz''" to become part of his show. Julie and Ernie are merged into a pair of [[conjoined twins]] and Ricky is transformed into a hideous half-man, half-monster.  Ricky meets the other freaks: Ortiz the [[Fedor Jeftichew|Dog Boy]] ([[Keanu Reeves]]), the self-proclaimed "Leader of the Freaks"; Worm ([[Derek McGrath]]), the half-man, half-[[worm]]; Nosey ([[Jeff Kahn]]), whose entire head is one big nose; Cowboy ([[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]]), the half-man, half-cow; the [[Bearded Lady]] ([[Mr. T]]); Sockhead ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]), who has a [[sock puppet]] for a head; The Eternal Flame ([[Lee Arenberg]]), who has constant flaming [[flatulence]]; Rosie the [[Microcephaly|Pinhead]]; The Hideous Frogman ([[Tim Burns (writer)|Tim Burns]]), a Frenchman in a scuba suit; and the skeleton of [[Paul Lynde]]. At first, Ricky wants nothing to do with any of the other freaks, but soon warms up to them after hearing their stories of how they came to be here. Meanwhile, he discovers that he's developed a telepathic bond with Stuey and summons him to get help. Stuey manages to sell Ricky's story to the [[Weekly World News]], but ends up being captured by a group of shady businessmen that presumably work for Elijah.  Ricky eventually finds out that Elijah's Zygrot suppliers are none other than E.E.S., who arrive at Freek Land with a shipment of Zygrot and an imprisoned Stuey Gluck. As they discuss their plans to mutate the world's population into an efficient workforce, Stuey follows a telepathic tip from Rick and manages to escape, grabbing the tainted batch of Zygrot along the way. On the day of when Ricky is to kill the other freaks, Stuey appears with the batch of Zygrot but a random audience member dumps it onto the kid, which turns him into a grotesque seven-foot monster.  Elijah goes ahead and infects Ricky with his own Zygrot, turning him into an equally grotesque seven-foot monster. As the Ricky Monster and Stuey Monster battle to the death onstage, Elijah catches the E.E.S. executives double-crossing him and stealing his "Tasty Freaks Machine"; but Elijah stops them by soaking them with the Zygrot, mutating them all into a giant, fleshy shoe. Right before the Ricky Monster is about to destroy the Stuey Monster, however, a wave of compassion comes over him, and he drops his weapon and gives Stuey a hug. Enraged, Elijah unsuccessfully tries to fight the Ricky Monster, who bashes him in the head, paralyzing him.  Back to the interview, it's revealed that Ricky had turned back to normal (along with most of the other freaks). They are then joined by the still-mutated Ortiz and the Stuey Monster before it's revealed that Skye Daley is actually Elijah C. Skuggs. Skuggs lunges after Ricky with a [[machete]], only to be gunned down by the now normal Julie. As she embraces Ricky, Skye rises again, this time to be gunned down by Ernie. Ricky and Julie kiss and everyone waves farewell to the audience until the film ends on a frozen shot of Skuggs once again rising up to attack Ricky.  
A Foreign Field
 Cyril (McKern) and Waldo (Randolph), who are British and American, respectively, have both returned to France in search of the same woman (Moreau) with whom they each had a rendezvous in 1944 (unknown to the other). Cyril is accompanied by fellow veteran Amos (Guinness), while Waldo has his petty daughter Beverly (Chaplin) and her henpecked husband (Herrmann) in tow. Amos is childlike and carries an empty jam jar as if it is a favored toy. The two groups encounter one another, and after some conflict find common ground in old sorrows. Along the way they meet the recently widowed Lisa (Bacall), who has come in search of her brother's grave.<ref></ref>  Eventually it is revealed that Amos saved Cyril's life during the battle of Normandy in 1944 but sustained a severe head-wound in the process. The wound has left Amos permanently brain-damaged and Cyril has been his carer ever since. Cyril also confides in the others that Amos does not have long left to live and this will be the last chance for the two men to come to Normandy to pay their respects to their close friend Briggs who was killed in action. Waldo has come to France for a similar reason, to visit the grave of a close buddy who was killed on D-Day. The trip helps put Beverly's problems into perspective and gives a new lease of life to her marriage. And it is revealed that Lisa's brother was in fact a German soldier but instead of showing hostility, the veterans instead pay their respects at his grave, in tribute to the bravery of the German forces who took part in the battle. The frame is completed via Amos' jam jar with the final image of the jar holding a handful of wildflowers and placed in front of Briggs' gravestone on Omaha Beach.

The Fugitive (1993 film)
  Dr. Richard Kimble, a prominent [[Chicago]] [[Vascular surgery|vascular surgeon]], arrives home to find his wife Helen fatally wounded by a one-armed man. Kimble struggles with the killer but he escapes. The lack of evidence of a break-in, Helen's lucrative life insurance policy, and a misunderstood [[9-1-1]] call result in Kimble's conviction of [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees|first-degree murder]]. Being transported to [[death row]] by bus, his fellow prisoners attempt an escape. The pandemonium sends the bus down a ravine and into the path of an oncoming train. Kimble escapes the collision and flees. Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard and his colleagues Renfro, Biggs, Newman and Poole arrive at the crash site and begin the search for Kimble. Kimble sneaks into a hospital to treat his wounds and alter his appearance. He eludes the authorities, but Gerard corners him at the edge of a storm drain over a dam. Kimble leaps into the raging water and escapes. [[File:John Hancock Center 031130.jpg|145px|thumb|left|Chicago, Illinois, where the story takes place.]] Kimble returns to Chicago to hunt for the murderer and acquires money from his friend and colleague Dr. Charles Nichols. Posing as a janitor, Kimble enters the local county hospital's prosthetic department to obtain a list of people who had their prosthetic arm repaired shortly after his wife's murder. Following a police lead confirming Kimble's recent whereabouts, Gerard speculates that Kimble is searching for the one-armed man. Kimble breaks into the residence of one of the people on the list, a former police officer named Fredrick Sykes. Kimble discovers that Sykes is the murderer and is employed by a pharmaceutical company, Devlin MacGregor, which is scheduled to release a new drug called Provasic. Kimble investigated the drug in the past and revealed that it caused liver damage, which would have prevented it from being approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]. He also deduces that Nichols, who is leading the drug's development, arranged a cover-up and ordered Sykes to kill him – his wife's death was incidental. Gerard follows Kimble's lead to Sykes' home and draws the same conclusion.  As Kimble takes an [[Chicago "L"|elevated train]] to confront Nichols at the drug's presentation in a hotel, Sykes appears and attacks him. In the struggle, Sykes shoots a transit cop before being subdued and handcuffed to a pole by Kimble. Kimble arrives at the pharmacon conference and interrupts Nichols' speech, accusing him of falsifying his medical research and orchestrating his wife's murder. They fight while being chased through the hotel by the marshals and police. Gerard calls out to Kimble that he knows about Nichols' conspiracy. Nichols knocks out Renfro and takes his gun and attempts to shoot Gerard, but Kimble attacks him from behind, knocking him unconscious. Kimble surrenders to Gerard, who escorts him out of the hotel. Nichols and Sykes are arrested. Kimble is exonerated and driven from the crime scene by Gerard.

Full Eclipse
  Max Dire is a [[Los Angeles]] detective who is feeling the strain that his profession entails when his wife of two years, Liza, accuses him of bringing his work home and leaves him to ponder her future, while his partner, Jim Sheldon, commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. Realising that Max is experiencing problems, Adam Garou, a high-ranking officer distinguished by his success in reducing crime in other big cities, invites Max to join him at a weekly meeting of other police officers who are experiencing difficulties at his apartment. Adam informs Max that he should try to solve his problems rather than quitting the force as he is a good detective.  Although Max is skeptical as to whether he will derive any benefit from the meeting, as he and his wife had already attended counselling sessions without success, he reluctantly attends the meeting at Garou's apartment where he meets other police officers who have experienced problems such as Casey Spencer and Ramon Perez. Everyone who Max meets at the meeting praises the impact that Garou's influence has had on their fortunes. Max soon realizes that the activities of the group consist not merely of talking but also entail embarking on vigilante missions to clean the streets of criminals.  Max advises Garou that he is not interested in joining the group, but he immediately forgets this and agrees to accompany them to a party where criminals are exchanging weapons. Before gatecrashing the party, Max, being a veteran detective, notices that each of the group members injects themselves with a strange chemical, which he learns has been produced by Garou. After they have injected this chemical, Max notes, thanks to his finely honed powers of observation, that Garou and his group are transformed becoming more powerful and seemingly impervious to injury. The next day Max attempts to advise his incredulous boss of the strange goings on, but to no avail.  He visits Casey Spencer who tries to persuade him to inject himself with the chemical. When he refuses, she shoots him. As Max lies dying on the floor gazing at her in a perplexed manner she injects him with the chemical and he is instantly healed. They sleep with one another and afterwards raid a criminal lair after injecting themselves. As Max and Casey kill the criminals, they sprout long claws from their knuckles, and grow sharp teeth. One of the criminals escapes and informs his crime boss what he is up against. He is given instructions to deal with Garou.  Garou learns of Casey's sexual encounter with Max and angrily advises her that he is 'top dog' before raping her. Afterwards Garou and his group, including Max, gather together for another night of attacking the criminals. After injecting themselves with Garou's chemical the officers enter a vehicle to depart on their journey. The vehicle explodes as the key is turned in the ignition. As the remnants of the vehicle burn, the criminal who had been instructed to kill Garou looks on with glee. This happiness is soon replaced by terror when he notices that all of the officers have survived and that they are in their monster-like state. In the next scene the dead bodies of the criminal and his associates are dropped from a helicopter through the glass ceiling of the crime boss' home.  The same night, Max meets in a holding cell an ex-police officer from a city where Garou used to work. The officer is deformed and speaks badly of Garou. He advises Max that Garou may have cleaned the streets of the other cities, but that all of the officers who had worked with him were killed (though he had escaped). He also explained that his deformity was caused by overuse of the chemical. Garou kills the officer to silence him and Max covers for him, but his suspicions are aroused and he begins to conduct some research into Garou.  After making a startling discovery, he sneaks into Garou's apartment and finds Garou extracting the chemical from his own brain. Max advises Garou that he realises that he is a werewolf. Conflict ensues and although Max and Casey escape from Garou's apartment, the latter is fatally injured. The next day Garou prepares to complete his final operation and Max resolves to stop him. After Garou has killed all of the criminals, including the aforementioned crime boss, Max shoots him with a silver bullet and Garou falls to the ground. Thinking that Garou is dead, Max turns away . Then suddenly, he hears Garou say 'Didn't you get my memo? A full eclipse protects me from everything; including silver'. A full eclipse had passed overhead as these events took place. As Max dreads to consider what will happen next, Garou asks him 'Wanna see something really scary?'. He then turns into an extremely large werewolf, losing his human form entirely.  Max flees as the other members of Garou's group are killed. Garou tries to kill Max, but the latter injects Garou with a solution of [[silver nitrate]]. As the eclipse is over, this kills Garou. Before he dies Garou returns to his human form and tells Max that if he lies in his blood he can take his power. In the final scenes of the film, Max is shown to have moved to Denver with his wife Anna and their relationship seems to have improved. She is shown cutting her finger with a knife as she is chopping up food. Max licks her finger and then leaves to undertake some paperwork. She notices that her cut heals immediately and stares after Max bewildered. Meanwhile, Max is shown looking up on a computer the dates of coming eclipses in different American cities. These scenes reveal that he has inherited Garou's power.

The Apache Indians have reluctantly agreed to settle on a U.S. government approved [[Indian reservation|reservation]]. Not all the Apaches are able to adapt to the life of corn farmers, and one in particular, Geronimo ([[Wes Studi]]), is restless.  Pushed over the edge by broken promises and unnecessary actions by the government, Geronimo and 30 other warriors form an attack team which humiliates the government by evading capture, while reclaiming what is rightfully theirs. The plot centers upon Charles Gatewood ([[Jason Patric]]), the U.S. cavalry lieutenant charged with capturing the elusive Apache leader with the assistance of a scout leader [[Al Sieber]] ([[Robert Duvall]]) and a young graduate [[Britton Davis]] ([[Matt Damon]]).  Gatewood is torn by a grudging respect for Geronimo and his people, and his duty to his country.  Brigadier General [[George Crook]] ([[Gene Hackman]]), charged with overseeing the forced settlement of the Apaches on reservations has nothing but admiration for Geronimo.  Geronimo surrenders to Crook but later escapes, taking half of the reservation with him. Gatewood, Sieber, Davis and a group of soldiers set out to capture Geronimo. Crook later resigns from the army and is replaced by General [[Nelson Miles]]. The next day Gatewood, Sieber, Davis and Apache [[Chato (Apache)|Chato]] come across some slaughtered Indians. They stop at a bar but there are bounty hunters there and they threaten to kill Chato for money which results in a shootout in which Sieber is shot and mortally wounded.

Ghost Brigade
 Slave traders bring back an evil voodoo entity that is accidentally freed by the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] during the Civil War. The entity possesses the bodies of the dead soldiers to create an army of its own bent on conquest, using the corpses of both the North and South. When both [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and Confederate soldiers are mysteriously murdered by the entity during the Civil War, the opposing troops must overcome their differences and band together to investigate the gruesome deaths. It soon becomes apparent that these killers are anything but human. Instead, they are a maniacal regiment of supernatural forces, and it is solely up to these united American soldiers to fight the slaughterous evil of the Ghost Brigade.  The film centers around Captain John Harling, a Union army man that has been awaiting the end of his parole; it is cut short when there are unusual murders of Union troops. To discover the culprits behind this Harling seeks Colonel Nehemiah Strayn, a former Confederate regiment commander, now sitting in a Union prison at Bowling Green, who was once Harling's teacher. The two officers, along with Colonel George Thalman supervising, set out with a small detachment of troops and a runaway slave named Rebecca. When they reach the site where several Union troops were murdered, Strayn tells about what happened to his regiment, whose gruesome end happened at the same place where the Union corpses were found.  After leaving the site and wandering deeper into Tennessee, they come across a group of Confederate soldiers, who quickly surrender, much to the surprise of the Union troops. The Confederate in charge tells Thalman that their group was attacked by a band of undead troops who took many of his men away, yet he was unaware of why he and his people were taken. Thalman, deciding that they require reinforcements, takes off leaving Harling in charge. But during the night, while Strayn and Rebecca are talking just a few yards away from the camp, they are assaulted by Stayn's old regiment, now a bunch of walking zombies. His former second-in-command, Major Josiah Elkins, tells him to lead this new regiment. Strayn refuses the offer, however, and escapes with Rebecca to the camp. Strayn warns everyone at the camp and they all hide behind the carts that the Confederates had with them and wait until the zombie soldiers approach them. After holding them off, they are surprised to see Thalman reappear again, but he has been changed. After being burned by Rebecca he returns to his former self, But before he dies, he puts Harling in charge, in hopes that Harling will see the men out.  The next day, since they don't have time to leave the area, they set a trap for the Ghost Brigade. Using Strayn to lure them back to the Union camp, he surprises them by picking up a pistol and killing one of them with a silver bullet which was created from the silver that the Confederates were carrying. The Ghost Brigade goes into a fury and attacks the joint Union/Confederate troops, who are positioned behind a trench filled with water and wagons turned into barricades. Strayn personally fights with Elkins in hand-to-hand combat before Elkins stabs him. Before he can finish Strayn, Rebecca leaps on top of him. The short struggle continues until Rebecca shoots Elkins by aiming at her chest when he was behind her. While barely alive, Harling realizes that she is infected and has to be shot. Strayn tries to intervene but Rebecca is shot. The last remaining zombie soldier cries over Elkin's corpse before he is shot by Harling. With the Ghost Brigade defeated, they head back for Union territory, where Strayn is sent back to Bowling Green prison for a short period, before he escapes and rejoins the Confederate Army. He fights with distinction during the battles of Gettysburg and other major Civil War battles, but his unusual stand against slavery alienates many of his countrymen. While Strayn is fighting in the Confederate Army, Harling decides to not take his parole and stays with the Union Army for duration of the war, serving under General U.S. Grant for the remainder of the Civil War.  The film ends with Harling telling the story of Strayn going back to the creek where his regiment was murdered, where he is never seen again.

Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II
 In 1992, the [[United Nations]] establishes the United Nations Godzilla Countermeasures Center (UNGCC) to stop Godzilla. The mechanical middle head of [[King Ghidorah|Mecha-King Ghidorah]] is salvaged by the UNGCCs military branch, known as G-Force, and [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] to create two anti-Godzilla machines, the first being an aerial gunship called Garuda and a [[mecha]] modeled after Godzilla called [[Mechagodzilla]].  Two years later, on a mission to Adona Island in the Bering Sea, a Japanese team comes across what they assume is a large ''[[Pteranodon]]'' egg. The egg gives off a telepathic signal that attracts [[Godzilla]] and [[Rodan]], an adult ''Pteranodon'' irradiated by the nuclear waste. Godzilla critically wounds Rodan during the ensuing battle, while the research team escapes with the egg. It's taken to a research center in Kyoto, where it imprints on a young female scientist. When a [[Godzilla Junior|Baby Godzilla]] hatches from the egg, the research team concludes that the egg was left in the ''Pteranodon'' nest with Rodan in a manner similar to the [[Brood parasite|brood parasitism]] displayed by [[European cuckoo]]s. Godzilla appears in Japan, once again responding to the creature's psychic call. The [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|JSDF]] mobilizes Mechagodzilla, which intercepts Godzilla as it is making his way to Kyoto. The two battle, with Mechagodzilla seeming to have the upper hand until Godzilla disables Mechagodzilla with an energy pulse. Godzilla continues searching for Baby, but the scientists, having discovered the telepathic link between the monsters, shield it from Godzilla. Frustrated, Godzilla destroys most of Kyoto before returning to the ocean.  Tests on the baby reveal that it has a [[Dinosaur intelligence#"Two brains" myth|second brain]] in its hips that controls the animal's movement. The UNGCC assumes that this also holds true for Godzilla, and decide to use Baby to bait Godzilla into a fight with Mechagodzilla. The "G-Crusher" is installed in Mechagodzilla's wrists, allowing the robot to penetrate Godzilla's hide and paralyze the monster by destroying his second brain. [[Miki Saegusa]], a young psychic, is ordered to become a part of Mechagodzilla's crew, and to locate Godzilla's spinal brain. She is reluctant to do so, due to her mental connection with Godzilla (established in ''[[Godzilla vs. Biollante]]''), but follows her orders. The plan backfires when Rodan, having survived its battle with Godzilla and further mutated by radiation, responds to Baby's call and intercepts the UNGCC transport.  The UNGCC is forced to send Mechagodzilla and Garuda after Rodan instead and, in the ensuing battle, Rodan is mortally wounded. Godzilla shows up moments later and attacks Mechagodzilla. When the two appear to be evenly matched, Mechagodzilla combines with Garuda. The upgraded Mechagodzilla, called Super-Mechagodzilla, carries out the G-Crusher plan and succeeds in paralyzing Godzilla. Suddenly, the dying Rodan, once again revived by Baby's call, begins flying towards Baby, but is shot down by Mechagodzilla, crashing atop Godzilla. Rodan's life force regenerates Godzilla's second brain and supercharges it. Now more unstoppable than before, Godzilla attacks and destroys Super-Mechagodzilla with a high-powered red spiral atomic ray.  Godzilla finally locates Baby, who is at first afraid of the giant monster. Miki telepathically communicates with Baby, convincing it to go with Godzilla. The two monsters head out to the sea.

Kalyan Kumar also has a son named Kannan ([[Arjun Sarja]]) but has been abandoned by the family members for marrying a girl without the family’s consent. But the family regularly receives money order from Kannan. Although Kalyan Kumar has changed his mind and accepted Kannan, he still does not return home. Everyone in Gokulam thinks that it is only Kannan’s wife who does not allow him to reunite with his family.  Mary gets close to Gokulam family members and attends singing classes from Kalyan Kumar. She helps everyone in the family as and when required. Chellappa falls in love with Mary and proposes to her. But Mary tells her flashback to Chellappa which shocks him.  Mary’s original name is Gayathri and she sings well. Gayathri and Kannan love each other. Gayathri is a rich girl but has no parents or relatives except for a guardian ([[Jaishankar]]) who has plans to get his son Vasanth (S. N. Vasanth) married to her. But Gayathri informs Jaishankar about her love towards Kannan for which he agrees immediately. Gayathri feels happy. Kannan requests the wedding to happen after a few days as he has to take care of his poor family. He says that his sister’s wedding should happen first.  Gayathri agrees for this and an engagement is planned between them on Gayathri’s birthday, but Vasanth gets furious knowing about this and decides to kill Kannan. Vasanth sends a few thugs to kill Kannan. Kannan fights them but gets stabbed at his back. He comes to the function and dies in front of Gayathri.  Jaishankar hands over Vasanth to police, and Vasanth gets jailed. Gayatri cries and feels bad that Kannan lost his life only because of loving her and decides to help his family. Kannan already informed his family about his love, which they didn’t agree. Gayathri writes a letter to Kannan’s parents that he has married against his their wishes.  Gayathri comes to Kannan’s village in the name of Mary and sends the money order to Kannan’s parents every month Kannan's name which makes them believe that their son is living in Chennai along with his wife. She also writes letters in Kannan's name to his parents. Chellappa feels proud of Gayathri and promises not to inform anyone about her real identity.  Kannan’s sister Uma’s wedding is arranged. But Gayathri comes to know that Uma earlier had a lover ([[Raja Ravindra]]) who ditched her and now is blackmailing her about revealing their old photographs taken together to everyone which will impact her marriage. Gayathri decides to help Uma and she goes to Raja Ravindra’s home alone in search of the photographs.  She finds the photos and burns them into ashes. Suddenly the guy comes and tries molesting Gayathri, but Chellapa comes and rescues her. The crowd gathers around, and Raja Ravindra lies that he has an illegitimate relationship with Gayathri, which shocks her. But Gayathri could not reveal her real purpose of visiting his home at night as that would affect Uma’s wedding. Finally, Gayathri accepts the blame and everyone ditches her for her morally incorrect behavior.  The village people ask Gayathri to vacate immediately, but she requests them to allow her to stay for one day so she can attend Uma’s wedding and then leave. Despite opposition, Gayathri attends Uma’s wedding but is insulted by Kalyan Kumar. Dejected Gayathri leaves the village immediately and has decided to accept a previous offer of going on a world tour performing stage shows along with her friend.  Chellappa informs Kalyan Kumar about all the truth and they realize their mistake. The two rush to Gayathri’s house, but she has left before that. Finally, the film ends showing Kalyan Kumar waiting in the village railway station daily morning for Gayathri’s return.  
Groundhog Day (film)
 Weatherman Phil Connors reassures [[Pittsburgh]] viewers that an approaching blizzard will miss western Pennsylvania. He goes with news producer Rita Hanson and cameraman Larry to [[Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania]], to cover the [[Groundhog Day]] festivities. Phil makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the "hicks" who live there.  The next day, Phil awakens at his Punxsutawney [[bed and breakfast]] to [[Sonny & Cher]]'s "[[I Got You Babe]]" on the clock radio. He tapes a half-hearted report on [[Punxsutawney Phil]] and the town's festivities. Rita wants to stay and cover other events, but Phil wants to return to Pittsburgh. The blizzard blankets the region in snow, stranding them in Punxsutawney. Phil shuns the celebrations and retires to bed early.  Phil wakes to "I Got You Babe" and the same announcement from the radio, and discovers the day's events repeating exactly. Phil relives the day and returns to bed, assuming it was a dream, but it is still Groundhog Day when he wakes: he is trapped in a [[time loop]] that no one else is aware of. Realizing there are no consequences for his actions, he spends the first several loops indulging in binge drinking, one-night stands, and reckless driving. He becomes depressed and commits suicide several times, but does not escape the loop.  Phil tries to explain his situation to Rita, for whom he has feelings, by accurately predicting the day's events. Rita sympathises and they spend the entirety of one loop together, but Phil wakes up alone as usual. He decides to use his knowledge of the day's events to better himself and the lives of others; he learns how to play the piano, sculpt ice, and speak French, but is unable to prevent the death of a homeless man.  During one loop, Phil enthusiastically reports the Groundhog Day festivities, amazing Rita. They spend the rest of the day together, with Phil impressing her with his apparent overnight transformation and charitable deeds. She successfully bids for Phil at a charity bachelor auction. Phil makes an ice sculpture of Rita's face, and tells her that no matter what happens, even if he is doomed to continue awakening alone each morning forever, he wants her to know that he is finally happy, because he loves her. They retire together to Phil's lodgings. Phil wakes to "I Got You Babe" again, but finds Rita is still in bed with him; he has escaped the time loop.  
Green Snake
 An overzealous [[Buddhist]] monk named Fat-hoi ([[Vincent Zhao]]) has trained for 20 years to solely banish demons from the Human World due to his prejudice against spiritual beings seeking to improve themselves. He captures a spider in human form, who has trained for 200 years to be able to reincarnate, and throws him underneathe a gazebo. Fat-hoi is later seen meditating, apparently being haunted by sins of the human mind and is being punished spiritually for his mistake. He eventually releases the Spider spirit.   A storm takes place while Fat-hoi goes into the forest and he attacks two Snake spirits. But after he noticed that they were only preventing rain from hitting a woman giving birth, he also releases them. Again, he is haunted by sins of the human mind, primarily the female body. The two snakes, White Snake ([[Joey Wong]]) and Green Snake ([[Maggie Cheung]]), are later seen on the rooftop of a festival where Green Snake participates in naked while White Snake eyes a local scholar Hsui Xien (Wu Hsing-Kuo). The two have been training for many centuries to take [[human]] form and experience the love, freedom and wisdom that is supposedly only available to humans. White Snake is the more experienced one and proceeds to get engaged to Hsui Xien, with whom she plans to have a child which would complete her passage into the mortal realm; Green Snake is the younger and more impulsive of the two sisters but she is not yet quite convinced of the benefits of the human world. They both move into their magically created house and start a successful medical practice in the town. Other than Hsui Xien's visit, the two gets another visit unexpectedly from a buffoonish [[Taoist]] whom Green Snake leaves the household to take care of. Because of White Snake's beautiful charms, Hsui Xien, once known as the toughest and most dedicated scholar of the village, is starting to lose his reputation.   In another heavy storm, a flood ravaged the village. White Snake and Green Snake helps to vanquish the flood and are helped by Fat-hoi, whom they remembered from the forest. After the flood is gone, White Snake and Green Snake tend to the medical needs of the villagers and they've become greatly respected. However, slowly, Green Snake is starting to envy White Snake and is beginning to yearn for the affections of a human, often using Hsui Xien as an experiment. Though caught multiple times, White Snake usually shrugs this off. One day while teaching, Hsui Xien spontaneously comes back to see White Snake but instead sees a large reptilian tail in their bathing room. He escapes and becomes paranoid of the symbolic snake-related objects in the village because of the Dragon Boat Festical. Drunk from gifts from the villagers, White Snake and Green Snake takes advantage and lies to him so it seemed as if he was hallucinating.   Because the festival is near, White Snake pushes Green Snake to leave the village knowing that a special wine consumed only on this day will make Green Snake reveal her true form (due to her inexperience). Green Snake sulks, rebelling to leave because of her envy towards White Snake and Hsui Xien. The night of the festival, White Snake drags an obviously-scared Hsui Xien to drink the special wine together. Hsui Xien instead secretly dumps the wine into their pond where Green Snake consumes it; White Snake was not able to prevent Hsui Xien from seeing Green Snake's true form and he dies from shock. They are interrupted by the Taoist and his two apprentices again, which White Snake disposed of hasily. She decides to go to Kwun Lun Mountain to obtain the Lin-Chi Herb, but because it is guarded by a Holy Crane, Green Snake decides to help out of guilt. Fat-hoi notices their presences and immediately follows them. After obtaining the Lin-Chi Herb, White Snake leaves Green Snake to fight against Fat-hoi but was quickly defeated. To let her go, the monk decided to challenge his own mentality by letting Green Snake distract him in any way while he meditates. When he loses the challenge, Green Snake quickly makes her way back to White Snake. Green Snake tells White Snake of Fat-hoi's challenge, White Snake shrugs her off, leaving Green Snake to assume that her older sister thinks she is inferior. To get a response out of White Snake, she seduces Hsui Xien and the two gets into a fight in which White Snake triumphed. She reveals to Green Snake that she is pregnant and cannot be with her anymore.  Hsui Xien goes to his class to find Fat-hoi and he was given Holy beads to protect himself from evil spirits, but instead tossed it into the river. He arrives at home and pleads for the two to leave while he checks to see if Fat-hoi is near. The monk goes into their home, distills the illusion of a magically-created home, and forcefully takes Hsui Xien from the human/spirit mixed marriage into his religious [[reeducation camp]]&ndash;styled temple, situated atop a mountain. While Hsui Xien struggles to resist becoming a monk, White Snake appears at the temple and begged for the return of her husband. When Fat-hoi refused, Green Snake joins White Snake and calls the monk on his promise to let them go if he lost the challenge. The two snakes create a flood, attempting to flood the temple but Fat-hoi lifts the entire temple into the air to prevent the catastrophe. When it failed, Fat-hoi tries to suffocate the two with his surplice but again, the two snakes were able to overcome it. White Snake suddenly goes into labor and the flood ran amok towards the village, destroying everything. The baby was then revealed to be a human baby boy and Fat-hoi is in shock but recedes his surplice thereby allowing Green Snake to enter the temple to retrieve Hsui Xien on White Snake's behalf. White Snake, however, is struggling to keep her baby above water when Fat-hoi saves the baby but White Snake dies from a huge incoming debris. Green Snake was able to rescue Hsui Xien from the complete flood of the temple, but after multiple attempts of calling out to White Snake, Green Snake kills Hsui Xien so that he can be with her in the afterlife. Fat-hoi attempts to punish her for her crime but instead acknowledges the fact that he too has led people to their deaths, mainly his fellow monks. After questioning the love that only humans are supposed to know of, Green leaves Fat-hoi to absorb the depth of the catastrophe alone.

Great Moments in Aviation
 Set in 1957, ''Great Moments in Aviation'' follows Gabriel Angel ([[Rakie Ayola]]), a young Caribbean woman from [[Grenada]] who embarks on a cruise to England with the intention of becoming an aviator. Upon boarding the ship, Gabriel finds herself assigned shared sleeping quarters with fellow passenger Duncan Stewart ([[Jonathan Pryce]]). The rest of the ship's passengers, including [[missionaries]] Angela Bead ([[Vanessa Redgrave]]) and Gwendolyne Quim ([[Dorothy Tutin]]) assume the two are married, and when Professor Rex Goodyear ([[John Hurt]]) appears to recognise Duncan as his old acquaintance Alasdair Birch, Duncan fosters the assumption to maintain his cover. It transpires that Duncan is a forger, who many years ago stole a [[Titian]] painting from Goodyear and had an affair with his wife. Goodyear believes that his painting is on board the ship, and leads Gabriel to believe that Duncan was responsible for his wife's death. She is furious with Duncan for lying to her, but the two go on to reconcile and later make love. Their romance is complicated by the fact Gabriel professes to have a husband waiting for her in England. She explains that he has been there for two years working, and she is joining him so that she can fulfil her lifelong dream of becoming a pilot — inspired by her grandfather Thomas ([[Oliver Samuels]]) who flew off into a storm and never came home. They begin a relationship nonetheless, supported by Angela and Gwendolyne, who also come to realise that they have feelings for one another. They each confess to having secretly been in love with the other for years, and become lovers, vowing to live together in their retirement. It comes to light that the death of Goodyear's wife was an accident, caused as he and Duncan fought over her. Duncan returns his painting, and goes on to burn all his forged documents and papers in front of Gabriel. She confesses that her marriage to Michael is over, and she and Duncan resolve to begin a life together. The film ends with Gabriel's grandmother Vesuvia ([[Carmen Munroe]]) reading her family a letter from England, informing them that Gabriel and Duncan are happy together, and are expecting a child. As the family express their delight, Gabriel flies overhead, having finally attained her pilot licence and become an aviator.

Guilty as Sin
 Jennifer Haines ([[Rebecca De Mornay]]) is an up-and-coming [[Chicago]] attorney. She wins a big case, celebrates with the man in her life, Phil Garson ([[Stephen Lang]]), and returns to work to a hero's reception.  Into her life walks David Greenhill ([[Don Johnson]]), who was seated in the gallery during her previous trial. Greenhill is a debonair and arrogant ladies' man who stands accused of murdering his wealthy wife, Rita (Brigitte Wilson). He wants Haines to represent him, but she declines.  Something about him intrigues her, though, so the equally arrogant Haines has second thoughts. She tells her law firm's superiors that this promises to be a high-profile trial and she wants it because: "I am that good."  Greenhill maintains his innocence but shows signs of irrational behavior that make Haines wary of him. She assigns her longtime investigator Moe ([[Jack Warden]]) to do some digging and he begins to unearth the defendant's shady past. Greenhill in the meantime starts showing up unexpectedly in Haines's social life, stalking her and dropping hints that something is going on between them.  Phil dislikes the guy intensely and demands Haines drop him as a client. She doesn't care for Greenhill either but resents being told what to do. She refuses to quit his case until her law partners notify her that the fee Greenhill promised remains unpaid. An unsympathetic judge ([[Dana Ivey]]) tells Haines it's her own fault and refuses to let her abandon her client.  Learning from Moe that Greenhill has a history of dating older women who usually end up dead, a horrified Haines wants to turn him in, but is bound to attorney-client privilege. She instead tries to sabotage her own case by having evidence planted at Greenhill's apartment, hoping that it will lead to his conviction. He knows she must be behind it and takes his revenge by viciously assaulting Phil, who ends up hospitalized.  Greenhill's case ends in a mistrial, after the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict. Greenhill, seemingly pleased, displays regret that he never had a chance to take the stand. He does so privately for Haines in the empty coutroom, revealing that he had been scouting her far in advance of the murder case. He confesses that he did indeed kill his wife and provides vivid details.  Greenhill further tells Haines that he knows she planted the evidence. He could use this to blackmail her, but says he has come to tire of her. Haines fears the psychopathic Greenhill will now come after her. She prepares to disclose everything, even at the cost of her career.  Greenhill anticipates this. He murders Moe, knocking him out and then setting fire to his office. He then intercepts Haines at her apartment building. He casually states that between Phil's beating and Moe's death, she is grieving enough to commit suicide. A fierce struggle ensues. Greenhill manages to throw Haines over a railing, but to his horror, she pulls him down with her. They fall several stories together. Greenhill is killed in the fall. Haines, cushioned by his body, is severely injured but survives.  As she is carried off to hospital, she triumphantly states: "I beat him, Phil. I beat him. Tough way to win a case."  
Hard Target
 In [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], a homeless [[veteran]] named Douglas Binder ([[Chuck Pfarrer]]) is the target of a hunt. He is given a belt containing $10,000 and told that he must reach the other side of town where he would then win the money and his life. Pursuing him is the hunt organizer Emil Fouchon ([[Lance Henriksen]]), his lieutenant Pik Van Cleef ([[Arnold Vosloo]]), a businessman named Mr. Lopaki who has paid $500,000 for the opportunity to [[human hunting|hunt a human]], and mercenaries including Stephan ([[Sven-Ole Thorsen]]) and Peterson ([[Jules Sylvester]]). Binder fails to reach his destination and is shot by three crossbow bolts. Van Cleef retrieves the money belt.  While searching for her father, Binder's long-estranged daughter Natasha ([[Yancy Butler]]) is attacked by a group of muggers who saw that she had a lot of cash earlier. She is saved by a homeless man with exceptional martial-arts skills named Chance Boudreaux ([[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]), a former [[Marine Force Recon]]. Chance is initially hesitant to involve himself with her mission, but as his [[Merchant shipping|merchant seaman]] [[union dues]] are in arrears he reluctantly allows Natasha to hire him as her guide and bodyguard during her search. Meanwhile, Chance's homeless friend Elijah Roper ([[Willie C. Carpenter]]) is the next to participate in Fouchon's hunt, and is also killed.  Natasha discovers that her father distributed fliers for a seedy recruiter named Randal Poe (Eliott Keener) who has been secretly supplying Fouchon with homeless men with war experience and no family ties. Natasha questions Randal about her father's death, but they are discovered by an eavesdropping Van Cleef. Fouchon and Van Cleef beat Randal to punish him for sending them a man with an interested family. New Orleans police detective Marie Mitchell ([[Kasi Lemmons]]) is reluctant to investigate Binder's disappearance until his charred body is discovered in the ashes of a derelict building. The death is ruled accidental, but Chance searches the ruins and finds Binder's [[dog tag]], which was pierced by one of the crossbow bolts. Van Cleef's henchmen suddenly ambush Chance and beat the recon unconscious to scare him and Natasha out of town. When he recovers, he offers Mitchell the dog tag as evidence that Binder was murdered. With the investigation getting closer, Van Cleef and Fouchon decide to relocate their hunting business and begin eliminating "loose ends". The [[medical examiner]] who had been hiding evidence of the hunt is executed along with Randal. Mitchell, Natasha and Chance arrive moments later at Randal's office and are ambushed by Van Cleef and several of his men. During the shootout Mitchell is shot in the chest and killed. Chance kills a handful of the mercenaries and escapes with Natasha. Fouchon and Van Cleef assemble their mercenary team and five paid-for hunters to continue the chase.  Chance leads Natasha to his uncle Douvee's ([[Wilford Brimley]]) house deep in the [[bayou]], and enlists his help in defeating the men. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee lead the hunting party to a warehouse of old damaged [[Mardi Gras]] [[float (parade)|floats and statues]], called "Mardi Gras graveyard", and kill off Fouchon's men one by one. Van Cleef is finally gunned down by Chance in a shootout. In the end, only Fouchon is left, but he holds Chance at bay by taking Natasha hostage and stabbing Douvee in the chest with an arrow. Chance charges him, attacking with a flurry of blows, and then drops a grenade in his pants. Fouchon attempts to dismantle the grenade, but fails and gets incinerated in the explosion. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee now make their way out of the warehouse.  
Grumpy Old Men (film)
 Retirees John Gustafson ([[Jack Lemmon|Lemmon]]), a former high school history teacher, and Max Goldman ([[Walter Matthau|Matthau]]), who was a television repairman, are childhood friends, longtime rivals and next-door neighbors in [[Wabasha, Minnesota]]. Their rivalry began decades earlier when John married Max's high school sweetheart, May. John and May eventually divorced after twenty years. John has a daughter, Melanie ([[Daryl Hannah]]), who is having marital problems, and had a son, Brian, who died in Vietnam. Max went on to marry Amy and had a son, Jacob ([[Kevin Pollak]]).   Max never regretted marrying Amy, and thought their marriage was the best thing that ever happened to him. Despite their differences, both men lead boring and lonely single lives, and share a love for [[ice fishing]], as well as competing, arguing, insulting, and pulling cruel [[practical joke]]s on each other. However, John has a problem that Max doesn't: he owes tens of thousands of dollars in back taxes to the [[Internal Revenue Service]], and is going to great lengths to avoid agent Elliot Snyder ([[Buck Henry]]).  When beautiful college professor Ariel Truax ([[Ann-Margret]]) moves in across the street, Max and John's rivalry is renewed as they compete for her attention. Early on, Ariel spends time with Max, which secretly upsets John. While fighting with Max, John answers his front door, thinking that it's Max, only to find that it is Agent Snyder and is forced to meet with him. Things do not end all badly for John, however: Ariel decides to cook him dinner and they spend the evening together.   As Ariel spends more and more time with John, Max becomes angry, eventually ramming his truck into John's fishing shanty to push it into the lake. John and Max quarrel, with Max accusing John of stealing Ariel away like he did May. John points out May's sexual prowess, arguing that he saved Max from an unhappy marriage and that Max was better off with Amy because she was a loving and loyal wife.   Although Max agrees, he notes that John will have no way to support Ariel when the IRS takes his house. Max's attempt at shame works, and John breaks up with Ariel despite having fallen in love with her. Ariel is offended and soon takes up with Max, while John sinks into a deep depression.  On Christmas Eve, the depressed John becomes even more upset when he learns that his daughter Melanie has forgiven her husband Michael, whom John dislikes.  After trying to convince Melanie to go through with her divorce, he fights with Michael over his mistreatment of Melanie. John then storms out of the house and heads to the local bar. Max's son Jacob witnesses the end of the argument and convinces Max to go talk to John. At the bar, John admits to Max that he loves Ariel and believes Max doesn't understand how depressed he was over letting her go.   He tells Max that none of it matters anymore because he got what he wanted in the end. When John decides to go home, Max follows John into the snow, wanting to make things right. By the time Max catches up to John, he finds him in a snow drift, experiencing a massive [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. After seeing John in the hospital, Max tells Ariel what happened. She rushes to John's bedside, and the two reconcile as he recovers. Max decides to step aside and let Ariel be with John.    Max tries to help John with his taxes, but because of the penalties induced by late payments, Snyder informs him that John owes $57,000, forcing John to sell his house in order to raise the large sum. Angered by Snyder's lack of sympathy, Max pays him back by pulling pranks and by getting his son Jacob, who has just been elected mayor, to block the sale of John's house.   Winter turns to spring, and John and Ariel get married. As a wedding gift, Max reveals to John that he was able to get John's tax debt reduced to the just over $13,000 that John originally owed and that Max paid it off himself. Max then goes off to a local dance sponsored by the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars|VFW]], while a newly single Melanie who is officially divorced and Jacob, left home alone, begin a new romance with each other.  
H.P. Lovecraft's: Necronomicon
  The film is broken into four separate features: "The Library", "The Drowned", "The Cold" and "Whispers". "The Library" segment is the wrap-around story, which begins and ends the movie.  ===The Library=== In the wrap-around story of the film, [[H. P. Lovecraft]] ([[Jeffrey Combs]]) learns of a monastery where a copy of the [[Necronomicon]] is held. Having been a regular there for his research, he sets up an appointment, his cab driver told to wait outside. Taking insult when the head monk calls his work "fiction", Lovecraft insists that all his writings are true. Requesting to read the ''Alchemical Encyclopedia Vol. III'', Lovecraft steals a key from another monk and flees to the cellar where the Necronomicon is being held. Unknown to him, a monk has seen him. Unlocking the vault where the book is held, the door closes behind Lovecraft unexpectedly, making him drop the key down a grating and into the water below.  As that happens, one of the seals is opened.  Lovecraft sits to read and record what he is reading. It's not specified if he sees visions of the future through the book, or if the book contains future accounts. It's likely the stories will come to pass, and for the Necronomicon have ''already'' passed, alluding to the Necronomicon's timelessness, as all the stories take place well beyond the 1920s.  ===The Drowned=== Edward De LaPoer, a member of the De La Poer family, is tracked down in Sweden after inheriting an old, abandoned family hotel. Left a sealed envelope from Jethro De La Poer, he learns of his uncle's tragic death. Upon a boat trip return to New England, a crash on the shore killed Jethro's wife and son. Distraught, Jethro picked up a copy of the Holy Bible in front of several funeral mourners, tossed it into the fireplace and announced that any god who would take from him is not welcome in his home.  That night, an odd fishman arrives and tells him he is "not alone", then leaves behind an English translation of the Necronomicon. Using the book, Jethro brings his family back to life. However, they are revived as unholy monsters with green glowing eyes and tentacles in their mouths. Feeling guilty, he chooses to commit suicide by casting himself off an upper floor balcony.  Edward, distraught over a car accident years before which killed his wife, Clara, finds the Necronomicon and performs the ritual to revive her. That night, Clara arrives and asks to be invited in. Edward apologizes for the accident. Tentacles extrude from Clara's regurgitates mouth, and in a panic, Edward pushes her away. Clara angrily attacks, but Edward, with a sword taken from a nearby wall, cuts her. She turns into a tentacle leading underneath the floor. Drawn underground from the injury, the creature below destroys the main floor and rises, a gigantic monster with tentacles, one eye and a large mouth. Edward cuts a rope holding the chandelier, jumps to it and climbs to the ceiling. "Clara" again tries to restrain him, but Edward destroys a stained glass window, the sunlight driving her away.  Edward pushes the chandelier rope free from the pulley, the pointed bottom piercing the monster in the eye, presumably killing it. Now on the roof, Edward has avoided the same fate that Jethro had years before, and decides to live.  ===The Cold=== Reporter Dale Porkel is suspicious of a string of strange murders in Boston over the past several decades. Confronting a woman at a local apartment building, he is invited in only to find the entire place is very cold. The woman he has confronted claims to suffer a rare skin condition which has left her sensitive to heat and light. Demanding the truth or his story runs as-is, Dale is told the story of Emily Osterman's arrival to Boston twenty years before.  Emily had supposedly taken residence in the apartment building, and told by Lena, the owner, not to disturb the other tenant, Dr. Richard Madden, a scientist. Her first night, she is attacked by her sexually abusive stepfather, Sam, who has tracked her down. Running away, the two struggle on the steps leading to the next apartment. Dr. Madden opens his door, grabs Sam's arm and stabs his hand with a scalpel. The fall down from the stairs kills him. Emily is bandaged up and given medication. That night, Emily is roused by drilling noises and blood dripping from her ceiling. Heading upstairs, she finds Dr. Madden and Lena mutilating Sam. She passes out, to awaken later in her bed with a clean ceiling. Dr. Madden assures her she was having a nightmare.  The next day while job hunting, Emily sees two cops with a flyer asking for information about the murder of Sam. She confronts Dr. Madden, and he comes clean: Though Sam was already dead from the fall, Dr. Madden claims he would have killed Sam regardless for what he had done to Emily. Dr. Madden reveals his copy of the Necronomicon and how he learned of its information on sustaining life. In the greenhouse, Dr. Madden proves this by injecting a wilted rose with a compound to revive it, claiming that as long as it is kept out of the sun, it will never die. The two have sex, with a distraught Lena spying on them.  That night, Lena threatens to kill Emily if Emily will not kill her, as Lena is in love with Dr. Madden, a feeling that has never been returned. Emily flees, only to return months later. Upon arrival, Emily finds her boss from the diner in Dr. Madden's apartment, struggling to avoid death. Lena stabs the man in the back, killing him. Lena insists on killing Emily, but Dr. Madden will not allow it, the struggle destroying lab equipment in the process. The resulting fire injures Dr. Madden severely, and without his fresh injection of pure spinal fluid, feels no pain as his body disintegrates before he dies. Lena shoots Emily with a shotgun in revenge. Emily announces her pregnancy, and Lena, feeling a loyalty to Dr. Madden, saves her.  Dale suspects the woman he's talking to is not Emily's daughter, but Emily herself, having contracted a disease from Dr. Madden during intercourse. Emily reveals he is right, and that she is still pregnant, hoping one day that her baby may be born. She also reveals that she has continued murdering for spinal fluid, and chooses to keep a supply stockpiled. Dale realizes his coffee has been drugged as an aged Lena approaches him, brandishing a syringe.  ===Whispers=== During a pursuit of a suspect known as "the Butcher", two police officers, Paul and Sarah of the Philadelphia Police Department, are arguing over their failed relationship and the coming baby. The argument leads to a crash, flipping the cruiser upside down. Paul, having unbuckled his seat belt in the argument, is knocked out and dragged off by an unseen person. Sarah unbuckles herself, breaks the window and exits the vehicle. Unable to call for backup, she follows a blood trail alone.  Inside the old warehouse, Sarah follows as Paul is taken down a service elevator. Sarah trips on a rope and falls through to the floor, saved from impact by the rope around her ankle. The rope breaks a second after. As she gets up, she finds a man in glasses, Harold Benedict. Insisting he is merely the landlord of the warehouse and the Butcher is a tenant, he offers to lead her to him. Downstairs, the two are shot at by Mrs. Benedict, a blind old woman. Sarah, sick of getting a run-around, takes the shotgun and orders the two to lead her to the Butcher. Mrs. Benedict indulges in gossip first, insisting she's not really Benedict's wife. She also claims the Butcher is an alien. While searching for the Butcher, Sarah makes her way to an underground cavern filled with bat-like creatures and other monstrosities, but the Benedicts pull the ladder from the hole, leaving Sarah trapped. As Sarah ventures through the cavern, she starts to become scared, even promising to keep her unborn child. She later sees Paul, but he has already been eaten by the bat-like creatures that inhabit the cavern. His brains are needed by the bats to reproduce. The bats then begin to corner her. She later wakes up on a table where Mr. and Mrs. Benedict are seemingly trying to feed Sarah to the alien bats.  Sarah suddenly wakes up in a hospital. Her mother and a doctor (who resemble the Benedicts) rush into her room. Sarah was forced to have an abortion as a result of the car accident earlier, but her mother insists that she will be forgiven if she forgives herself. Sarah wants to see Paul, but Paul is brain dead and turns out to be in the very same state that he was found back in the caverns. Sarah screams in terror in spite of her mother's pleas to not scare the baby. Sarah does not understand what her mother is talking about, as she thought the baby had to be aborted. Her mother opens her blouse and reveals that the baby is inside the womb of the alien-bat creatures. Sarah is even more scared especially after removing her bed sheets and finding out she has lost half of one of her arms. Suddenly, the hospital setting changes back into the cavern. Sarah is still on the table, about to become a meal for the alien bats. Harold wants to leave but Sarah still has the keys.  ===The Library=== With the conclusion of the third tale, Lovecraft is confronted by the head monk, who assures him that all will be fine if he opens the door. Lovecraft admits he dropped the key. Furious, the monk warns Lovecraft to replace the book, but the author is attacked by a monster in the water beneath him, and the last of the seals opens up. The head monk reveals himself to not be human at all, as he begins stretching his body through the bars to enter the room, and Lovecraft uses a sword in his cane to defeat the monster in the water.   Gathering his things and grabbing the book, Lovecraft begins to depart, being caught by one of the monks who warns him of the foolishness of his actions, telling him he will pay for his misdeeds. Lovecraft then escapes to the taxi and orders it to leave, and it leaves unpursued.

Heart and Souls
 In [[San Francisco]], 1959, four despondent strangers embark on the same night trolleybus: Penny, a single mother, regrets working the night shift and leaving her three children at home; Harrison, a would-be singer, has backed out of an important audition due to [[stage fright]]; Julia leaves her waitressing job to seek out her boyfriend John, whose marriage proposal she rejected; and small-time thief Milo has just failed to retrieve a book of valuable stamps that he had [[Confidence trick|conned]] out of a young boy. Their trolleybus driver is Hal, who becomes distracted by an attractive passenger in another car and accidentally swerves the trolleybus off an [[overpass]], killing everyone aboard.  At the same time, Frank Reilly is driving his pregnant wife Eva to the hospital. Frank avoids the trolleybus just before it crashes. The Reillys are safe, but Eva delivers their baby in the car. Hal ascends into the [[heaven|next life]], but the souls of the four passengers are "attached" to the newborn baby, Thomas, for reasons they do not understand. Only Thomas can see and hear them, and they are forced to follow him wherever he goes. As the years pass, the four grow to love Thomas, and he them. As Thomas grows older, however, his parents worry about his obsession with his "invisible people" and consider having him [[involuntary commitment|committed]]. Realizing their presence is harming Thomas, the quartet decides to become invisible to him as well. The perceived abandonment causes young Thomas to avoid close relationships for the rest of his life, fearful that they, too, will leave him.  Twenty-seven years later, in 1993, Hal returns with his trolleybus. Because his irresponsibility ended four innocent lives, Hal has been condemned to [[psychopomp|convey spirits to the next life]], and he has now come for his former passengers. The quartet learns that they've been with Thomas all these years because each of them died with unfinished business: Penny never found out what became of her children, Harrison never conquered his fears and fulfilled his dream of public singing, Julia never told John her true feelings, and Milo never returned the stamp album, which would have freed him of the guilt from his life of crime. Thomas was meant to serve as their corporeal form, helping them to resolve their final business; if he refused to help, they were to inhabit his body and use it to solve their problems. After convincing Hal to buy some more time for them to rectify their unfinished lives, they reappear to Thomas, now a ruthless foreclosure banker who refuses to open up to his devoted girlfriend Anne.  Thomas, who has since undergone [[psychotherapy]] to convince himself that his "imaginary friends" were only a childhood delusion, initially believes their reappearance means he has had a [[psychotic break]]. Ignoring their pleas, he attempts to check himself into a [[psychiatric hospital]], where a [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] patient is able to describe the spirits that accompany him. This convinces Thomas that the spirits are real, but he is still angry with them for their abandonment and refuses to help them. The quartet convince him by leaping in and out of his body during an important meeting and threatening further public humiliation until Thomas reluctantly agrees to help in order to finally be rid of them.   Thomas is able to locate Penny's two daughters, but not her youngest child Billy, who was adopted after Penny's death. Milo uses Thomas's body to [[breaking and entering|break into a house]], [[burglary|steal back the stamp album]], and return it to its now-adult owner. However, after the burglary, a nervous Thomas encounters a police sergeant (who is ticketing his illegally parked car) and accidentally gets himself arrested, forcing Anne to bail him out. Harrison uses Thomas's body to sing [[The Star-Spangled Banner|the national anthem]] at a [[B.B. King]] concert, after which Thomas is arrested again by the same police sergeant, who Penny suddenly recognizes as her son. Thomas tells Billy the location of his long-lost sisters, and Billy is so overcome that he lets Thomas go with a warning. Meanwhile Anne, concerned with Thomas's recent bizarre behavior, demands to know what's going on. When he is unable to tell her, she breaks up with him.  Finally, Thomas and Julia write a letter to Julia's boyfriend John in which she confesses her love for him, only to learn that John died several years before. At the same moment, the trolleybus returns to take Julia. Thomas protests that Julia's business is still unresolved, but Julia realizes that her true business is Thomas, who is making the same mistake with Anne that she made with John. Thomas promises her that he will tell Anne his true feelings before it is too late, allowing Julia to depart.  Thomas invites Anne back to his apartment, where he admits his fear of abandonment and his love for her. As a symbol of his trust, he gives her a heart-shaped keyring containing all his personal keys. Anne forgives him. The two dance under the night sky where four new stars twinkle to show that Penny, Julia, Harrison, and Milo are finally at peace.

Hocus Pocus (1993 film)
 In 1693 on October 31, near Salem, Massachusetts, Thackery Binx sees his little sister, Emily, spirited away to the cottage of three witches. There, the Sanderson sisters, Winifred, Sarah and Mary, cast a spell on Emily to absorb her youth and regain their own, killing her in the process. Thackery confronts the witches who transform him into an [[immortality|immortal]] [[black cat]] to live with his guilt for not saving Emily. The townsfolk, led by Binx's father, capture the witches. But before being [[hanging|hanged]], Winifred's spellbook casts a [[curse]] that will [[resurrection|resurrect]] the witches during a full moon on [[Halloween|All Hallows Eve]] when any virgin lights the Black Flame Candle. Thackery guards the cottage to ensure no one summons the witches.  Three hundred years later on October 31, 1993, Max Dennison is feeling unsettled from his family's sudden move from Los Angeles to Salem. While exploring the town, he and his sister Dani meet Allison, whose family owns the Sanderson cottage as a [[museum]]. Max suggests that they go there and impress Allison, but is forced to take Dani trick-or-treating.  Investigating inside the cottage, Max lights the Black Flame Candle and inadvertently resurrects the witches, who plot to continue their plan to suck out the souls of all of Salem's children, beginning with Dani. Escaping, Max steals Winifred's spellbook on advice from Thackery. The witches pursue them to a cemetery, where Winifred raises her unfaithful lover Billy Butcherson as a [[zombie]] to chase them on foot. The witches try to [[acclimate]] to the 20th century, but are horrified when they discover Halloween has become a holiday, and their broomsticks are stolen. The witches plan to achieve their goals or they will be disintegrated on [[sunrise]]. They pursue the children across town using Mary's enhanced sense of smell. Max, Allison and Dani find their parents at a Halloween party at the town hall, where Winifred enchants the partygoers to dance and sing until they die. At Jacob Bailey High School, the children trap the witches in a [[kiln]] to burn them alive. While celebrating, the witches' curse revives them again, and they kidnap Dani and Thackery after Max and Allison open the spellbook exposing their location. Sarah then uses her [[Siren (mythology)|siren]]-like singing to mesmerize Salem's children, luring them to the Sandersons' cottage. Max and Allison rescue Dani and Thackery by tricking the witches into believing sunrise came an [[Daylight saving time|hour early]].  Back at the cemetery, Max runs into Billy, who cuts open his stitched up mouth and insults Winifred, joining Max to protect Dani. The witches attack and Winifred attempts to suck out the soul from Dani with the single vial of potion she retrieved from her cauldron. Thackery leaps on Winifred and knocks the potion out of her hand into Max's, but is then thrown to the ground and mortally wounded. Rather than smashing the vial, Max drinks it and apparently makes himself a sacrifice. As the sun rises, Winifred is unable to drain Max's life force from him after falling into the [[hallowed]] ground, and soon turns to stone and is disintegrated to [[dust]] along with her sisters.  As the satisfied Billy returns to his grave, Thackery dies, freeing his soul. He thanks Max, Dani and Allison for their help, and bids farewell to them, before he and Emily walk into the afterlife. As the end credits begin, the exhausted partygoers are freed from the spell and return home. Meanwhile, at the Sandersons' cottage, Jay and Ernie, two male bullies who earlier tormented Max and Dani, remain imprisoned in their cages while passing the time singing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat". The film ends with Winnie's spellbook opening its eye, implying that Winnie's last words re-activated the resurrection spell.  
The Hidden II
 The alien criminal from the first movie is dead, but he left a few eggs which are hatching now. It is explained that on the alien's homeworld, evolution took two parallel paths: half of their race became violent criminals who live only for pleasure (the squid-like alien form briefly glimpsed in the first film), and the other half evolved beyond their base desires and even physical bodies, becoming creatures of pure energy. The good alien (Lloyd Gallagher), who still inhabits Tom Beck’s body (played now by [[Michael Welden]]), has been waiting just in case this happened. Unfortunately, his presence in the body has taken a terrible toll on it, draining it of life energy. Additionally, relations with Beck’s daughter Juliet ([[Kate Hodge]]), now a cop herself, have deteriorated (possibly due to his bizarre behavior caused by the alien inhabiting his body). But when the killing starts again, both will need to work together - and with a new alien policeman ([[Raphael Sbarge]]), who comes to Earth to aid in the struggle - to stop the new generation of aliens.  
Holy Weapon

The Higher Mortals
 Crabbe College is a lesser-known girls' boarding school (described at one point as "a little family school founded in the 1950s by a woman who was potty about [[poetry]]") which (like a considerable number of real schools of that ilk at the time, many of which closed) is suffering serious financial problems following the recession. The headmistress, Miss Thorogood (played by [[Susannah York]]) announces that some girls "and some boys" from deprived [[inner city]] areas will be coming to the school, as part of a plan by the [[Her Majesty's Government|government]] to help struggling private schools while simultaneously giving it justification for its cutbacks of [[social services]] in deprived areas. "The Higher Mortals", while also alluding to the general assumed social position of those already at the school, specifically refers to a secret society founded by some of the girls, based around social [[elitism]] and a particular veneration of [[literature]].  The inner-city children - four boys, Jason, Wayne, Clint, and Ryan, and one girl, Hayley (whose mother had committed [[suicide]]) arrive at the school and are, for the most part, viewed with hostility and a general lack of understanding. It is implied that the boys are at the school due to an error in social services, with Miss Thorogood commenting that she is not even sure they have the same inner-city children they were intended to have. There is some hostility towards one of the boys, Ryan, on the grounds that he is [[black people|black]], with one teacher (the reactionary Mr Bowles, played by Richard Kane) describing him as a "black bastard". There is an incident of [[Joyride (crime)|joyriding]], and it is revealed that at least one of the boys cannot read. A mood of uncertainty seems to run through the school as the summer term goes on, and it is made clear that the school's financial situation is more serious than it is willing to make public.  One of the inner-city children, Clint (played by Glen Mead) seems to blend into the school environment (he is seen reading right-wing newspapers such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', ''[[The Times]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'') and is little heard from in the film's later stages. However, the other inner-city children develop a plot to burn the school down, which they trick some of the girls into participating in. On the day that education secretary Mrs Fry (who somewhat resembles the then government minister [[Virginia Bottomley]]) arrives to speak at the school's Speech Day, she is kidnapped by the inner-city children and tells them, incorrectly, that she will announce that the scheme of sending inner-city children to Crabbe College was a pointless waste of time and that the school was outmoded anyway.  At Speech Day, Mrs Fry actually says that it had been a great success, had secured the school's future and had justified the government's cutbacks in public funding. At this point, the plot to burn the school down (using [[petrol]] among other things) is put into action. In a powerful sequence, the headmistress is seen talking about "this still undeniably great country" as part of the school is already in flames.  Jason and Wayne are both killed in their getaway car after one of them lights a cigarette while his hands are still covered in petrol. The film ends with Vicky saying that Crabbe College had been so badly damaged that it was closed down, with its pupils going to other schools. She herself had transferred to the [[comprehensive school]] that Hayley had come from, and she concludes by commenting that "I learnt that prize day that there could be no poetry for Jason and Wayne, and that ideals such as ours in the Higher Mortals had almost been abandoned. My education had begun".  
The House of the Spirits (film)
  ;Prologue A young woman, Blanca Trueba ([[Winona Ryder]]), arrives at a house with an old man and the young woman starts remembering her life.  ;Clara and Esteban Blanca's mother, Clara del Valle ([[Meryl Streep]]) was a child with psychic power when Esteban Trueba ([[Jeremy Irons]]) came to propose to Clara's older sister, Rosa del Valle. Esteban left his fiancée with her family to earn money for their wedding. One day, Clara has a vision and tells her sister Rosa that there will be a death in the family. The next day, Rosa dies after drinking poison intended for her father, Senator Severo. Clara blames herself for her sister's death, and after watching her sister's autopsy, decides never to speak again.  Esteban was heartbroken. At home, his sister, Férula ([[Glenn Close]]) lives and takes care of their sick mother. Esteban used the money he earned from mining and bought a hacienda, Tres Marías. He finds many natives living on his land and tells them to work for him for food and shelter. For the next twenty years, Esteban makes Tres Marías an example of a successful Hacienda. One day he rapes a peasant girl, Pancha García ([[Sarita Choudhury]]) and she gave birth to a son. He spends some nights with Tránsito, a local prostitute ([[María Conchita Alonso]]), to whom he lends money so she can start a new career in the capital.   Twenty years later, Esteban receives a letter that his mother has died. After her funeral, Esteban decides to ask for Clara's hand, despite Férula's protests that Clara is too sickly and will not take care of him properly. When he shows up at the Del Valle family's house, Clara asks him right away if he has come to ask her to marry him, thus speaking again for the first time in twenty years.  Férula meets Clara at a coffee shop to talk about her own future, and Clara, sensing Férula's worries, promises her that she can live with her and Esteban in Tres Marías after the wedding and the two will be like sisters.  Clara gives birth to a girl as she predicted, and names her Blanca. One day, the girl whom Esteban raped, Pancha García appears at the family house with Esteban's illegitimate teenage son, Esteban García and asks for money. Esteban Trueba gives them some money and harshly orders them never to come back threatening to have his dogs attack them both if they return.  Clara holds classes for the peasant children and Blanca. Pedro Tercero, the young son of Esteban's foreman Segundo at Tres Marias befriends Blanca and the two become playmates. Esteban Trueba does not like his daughter playing with a peasant boy and sends Blanca to a [[boarding school]].  ;Blanca and Pedro Tercero After graduating from school, Blanca returns home to Tres Marías and meets with Pedro Tercero ([[Antonio Banderas]]) by the lagoon every night. One night while Esteban attends a political meeting, there is an earthquake; he worries about Clara and Blanca, goes home to Tres Marías and finds that Férula has climbed into bed with Clara. He is so angry that he throws Férula out of the house telling her never to come back. Férula curses Esteban but leaves. Clara is deeply disappointed that Esteban would kick his sister out of their family home.  One day Esteban brings the [[French people|French]] Count Jean de Satigny ([[Jan Niklas]]) to his home intending to arrange a marriage between him and Blanca. Clara senses that the French "nobleman" is a fraud while reading cards, but Esteban dismisses her folly.

Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey
 Chance (voiced by [[Michael J. Fox]]), an immature and disobedient [[American Bulldog]] and the narrator of the film, explains that he is the pet of Jamie Burnford (Kevin Chevalia), but expresses no interest in his owner or being part of a family. He shares his home with Shadow (voiced by [[Don Ameche]]), a wise old [[Golden Retriever]] owned by Jamie's brother Peter ([[Benj Thall]]), and Sassy (voiced by [[Sally Field]]), a smart-mouthed [[Himalayan cat]] owned by Jamie and Peter's sister Hope ([[Veronica Lauren]]). That morning, the children's mother, Laura Burnford ([[Kim Greist]]), marries Bob Seaver ([[Robert Hays]]), and Chance manages to cause chaos by digging into the wedding cake in front of all the guests.  Shortly after the wedding, the family has to move to [[San Francisco]] because Bob must temporarily relocate there for his job. They leave the pets at a ranch belonging to Kate ([[Jean Smart]]), a family friend. Shadow and Sassy start missing their owners immediately, but Chance sees it as an opportunity to explore and have fun. Later in the week, Kate goes on a [[cattle drive]], leaving the animals to be looked after by her neighbor Frank (Gary Taylor). However, Frank does not see her message and thinks that she has taken them along, leaving the  animals alone.  Worried by the disappearance of their host, the animals fear they have been abandoned. Shadow, refusing to believe that his boy would abandon him, resolves to make his way home.  Not wanting to be left alone on the ranch, Chance and Sassy decide to accompany Shadow on his journey.  They head into the rocky, mountainous wilderness of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevadas]] with Shadow leading by instinct. After a night spent in fear of the woodland noises, the group stops to catch breakfast at a river.  However, two black bear cubs bother Chance and a large brown bear causes the group to flee.  At another river, Sassy refuses to swim across to follow the dogs and instead tries to via a wooden path further downstream; halfway across, the wood breaks and she falls into the river.  Shadow tries to save her, but she goes over a waterfall to her apparent death.  Devastated, Shadow and Chance go on without her.  Unknown to them, Sassy survives and is later found on the riverbank by an old man named Quentin ([[William Edward Phipps]]), who nurses her back to health.  Over the next two days, Shadow and Chance try unsuccessfully to catch food and encounter a mountain lion, which chases them to the edge of a cliff. Chance, assuming he is about to die, reveals his dark secrets to Shadow by telling him where he has buried everything at home.  When Chance mentions that the remote control is buried under the seesaw, Shadow gets an idea to use a balanced rock shaped like a seesaw as a way to thwart the mountain lion. While Shadow acts as bait, Chance pounces onto the end of the rock and sends the mountain lion over the cliff and into a river. Sassy hears the dogs barking in celebration and follows the sound to rejoin them.  The animals continue on their way, but Chance tries to befriend a [[porcupine]], ending up with a load of quills in his muzzle.  The animals then encounter a little girl named Molly (Mariah Milner), who is lost in the woods. Too loyal to ignore her, they stand guard over her and keep her warm during overnight. In the morning, Shadow finds a rescue party and leads them back to the girl.  They recognize the animals from a missing pets flyer and take them to the local [[animal shelter]], but Chance mistakes it for a [[dog pound]] and the trio panic.  As the medical staff removes the quills from Chance's muzzle, Sassy sneaks in and frees Shadow. Together, they retrieve Chance and escape the shelter, unaware that their owners are on their way to get them.  Finally reaching their hometown, the animals cross through a train yard, where Shadow falls into a muddy pit and injures his leg.  Demoralized, he tells Chance and Sassy to go on without him.  Near dusk, Chance and Sassy finally make it home and are happily reunited with their owners.  Shadow initially fails to appear, but eventually he limps into view and happily comes running home at the sight of Peter.  Chance narrates how it was Shadow's belief that brought them home and how the years seemed to lift off of him, making him a puppy again as he reunited with his boy.  The film ends with Chance musing about how he truly feels "home" with his family, before happily running into the house at the smell of food.  
Hot Shots! Part Deux
 One night, an American [[special forces]] team invades [[Saddam Hussein]]'s (Haleva) palace and a nearby prison camp to rescue captured soldiers from [[Operation Desert Storm]] and to eliminate Saddam, but they find the Iraqis prepared for them, and the entire rescue team is captured. This failed operation turns out to be the latest in a series of rescue attempts which were foiled by the Iraqis, and consequently the advisors of [[President of the United States|President]] Benson (Admiral Benson in the [[Hot Shots!|previous film]], played by [[Lloyd Bridges|Bridges]]) suspect sabotage in their own ranks. Colonel Denton Walters ([[Richard Crenna|Crenna]]) suggests to gain the aid of war hero Topper Harley ([[Charlie Sheen|Sheen]]) for the next mission, but Topper has retired from the [[United States Navy]] and become a [[Buddhist]] in a small [[Thailand|Thai]] village. Walters and Michelle Huddleston ([[Brenda Bakke|Bakke]]), [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], arrive and try to persuade him to come out of retirement in order to rescue the imprisoned soldiers and the previous rescue parties.  Topper initially refuses, but when yet another rescue mission (this one, in turn, led by Walters) goes awry, he agrees to lead a small group of soldiers into Iraq. He is joined by Williams ([[Michael Colyar|Colyar]]), Rabinowitz ([[Ryan Stiles|Stiles]]) and Harbinger ([[Miguel Ferrer|Ferrer]]), the sole escapee of the prior rescue mission and whom Topper suspects to be the wanted saboteur. They parachute into an Iraqi jungle close to the heavily guarded hostage camp and set off to meet their contact, who turns out to be Topper's former love, Ramada ([[Valeria Golino|Golino]]). Ramada guides them to a fishing boat that she prepared for their transportation. As they move towards the camp, she and Topper reminisce, and she explains that she was married before she met him. When she was informed that her husband, Dexter ([[Rowan Atkinson|Atkinson]]), was still alive and a prisoner in Iraq, she volunteered to participate in his liberation, but was instructed to keep this strictly confidential, forcing her to break up with Topper just as they were ready to start a new life together; this also led to Topper's decision to retire.  Topper's team proceeds to the prison camp disguised as river fishermen, but a confrontation with an Iraqi patrol boat thwarts them. When President Benson hears of the apparent failure of another mission, he takes matters into his own hands and joins additional forces in Iraq. However, Topper and his teammates have survived, and soon reach the Iraqi hostage camp. In the course of the operation, the alarm is raised and a gunfight ensues, during which Topper finds out that Harbinger is not the saboteur, but has merely lost faith in fighting, and manages to motivate him. After the prisoners are freed, Topper decides to rescue Dexter, who has been brought to Saddam's palace.  While the squad evacuates the hostages, Topper enters Saddam's palace and runs into the dictator himself, who pulls out his machine pistol and commands Topper to surrender. Topper disarms Saddam, and they engage in a sword fight. President Benson arrives and orders Topper to rescue Dexter while Benson and Saddam continue the duel. Benson defeats Saddam by spraying him with a fire extinguisher, upon which he and his dog solidify and crack into pieces, only to subsequently [[liquefaction|liquify]], combine and reform as Saddam with his dog's head fur, nose and ears. In the meantime, Topper manages to find and liberate Dexter, but is forced to carry him out on his shoulder as the Iraqis have tied Dexter's shoelaces together.  The squad heads back to the army helicopter, where Ramada, after a complicated revelation involving unfounded jealousy, reveals and arrests Michelle as the saboteur who betrayed the previous rescue attempts to the Iraqis. Dexter arrives with Topper and insists on taking a picture of him and Ramada, but backs away too far and topples over a cliff. President Benson joins the escapees, and the evacuation team lifts off; Saddam is about to shoot down the chopper when Topper and Ramada get rid of extra weight in it by pushing a piano out the open door, which crushes him. Topper and Ramada kiss as they ride off into the sunset.

The Hour of the Pig
  ''The Hour of the Pig'' is set in [[France in the Middle Ages|15th-century France]] and is based upon the career and case files of [[Barthélemy de Chasseneuz|Bartholomew Chassenee]], an actual lawyer of the time who served as an advocate for animals who were accused of crimes.<ref name="Tr:Esfdicl">Marston, David W.; [http://www.thetrial.net/BaltimoreSun_4Sept05.htm "Entertaining stories fill docket in court lore"] ''Baltimore Sun'', 4 September 2005</ref> At the time, [[animal trial]]s were used to determine if animals were the perpetrators of [[supernatural]] mayhem.<ref name="HC:Trial06">Kadri, Sadakat; [http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/Our_Titles/Pages/Home.aspx?objid=17509 "The Trial: A History from Socrates to O.J. Simpson"]  ''HarperCollins'', 3 July 2006 ()</ref> Animals were subject to the same civil laws and penalties as human beings under [[Law of France|French law]], 1403–1596.  Richard Courtois (Firth) and his clerk Mathieu (Carter) have left the decadence of [[Paris]] in order to practise [[Lawyer|law]] in what they believe to be a quiet rural village, [[Abbeville]], in the province of [[Ponthieu]], then part of [[Burgundy]] rather than France. Courtois quickly becomes involved in a number of back-logged cases.  For his first case, he defends a farmer who is accused of killing his wife's lover. Courtois gets him acquitted (the farmer mutters, "I should have done him years ago" as he leaves and offers to help Courtois any time). In his next case, Courtois fails to save Jeannine, a woman accused of [[witchcraft]]. He asks for rats to be called as witnesses to testify that she did not bribe them to infect her neighbor; when the rats do not appear the following day as summoned, this charge is struck off. However, Courtois is unfamiliar with the difference between the Roman law of France and the Ponthieu [[customary law]], and she is sentenced to be hanged anyway. As she is led away she tells Courtois, "There is darkness all about you, you can bring the light. Look to the boy, maître. Look to the boy." At her execution, Jeannine says she will not curse the town but blesses it, saying a fine knight will arrive and deliver them from their lying and evil.  Courtois takes on a case defending a pig that is accused of killing a young [[Jew]]ish boy. The pig, however, belongs to a band of [[Moors]] (alternatively/first thought to be [[Romani people|Gypsies]], being referred to as coming from "Little Egypt") passing through town. Two of the Moors, Mahmoud ([[Sami Bouajila]]) and his sister Samira (Annabi), appeal to Courtois to save the pig, as it is their only source of food for the coming winter. Courtois declines. Samira later enters Courtois's room at night and quietly strips naked, offering her body in return for his services, but he refuses this. The next day he offers her enough money to purchase two pigs, but she does not accept this.  As Courtois delves deeper into the case and becomes more involved with Samira, he discovers that there is more at work than a simple murder. His work is brought to the attention of Seigneur Jehan d'Auferre (Williamson), who has his own designs on Courtois. Soon, Courtois finds that he is being used as a pawn in a complicated game of [[sociopolitical]] intrigue that extends beyond mere racism and corruption. The Seigneur subtly offers to bribe Courtois, also hinting that his daughter Filette is available in marriage. The Seigneur's son and daughter are eccentric to the point of insanity. The son's main hobby seems to be torturing birds.  Courtois's relationship with Samira becomes common knowledge. The Seigneur decides to sit in at court and uses this knowledge to threaten Courtois into letting the pig be executed. Just as the case seems to be over, the [[Advent]] festival begins and the case is adjourned.  The prosecutor Pincheon (Pleasence) tells Courtois that he moved from Paris to Ponthieu as Courtois did, in order to shine in a village in a way he could not in Paris. He urges Courtois to go back to Paris and not waste his life among ignorant, superstitious peasants.  The skeleton of another Jewish boy who went missing over a year ago is found while Courtois's house is being built. Courtois now suspects a human [[serial killer]] is at large and the pig has been framed.  On [[Christmas Day]], Samira performs for a gathering of notables at the Seigneur's chateau. She is almost arrested for drawing a knife on the Seigneur's son after he pours wine down her blouse. Courtois boldly leads her away. That night, he rescues a boy from a masked horseman wielding an axe.  Courtois confronts the Seigneur, telling him his son is the killer. The Seigneur does not deny it and reveals that his son has left for England to be treated. At the trial, the pig is acquitted when Valliere, the farmer Courtois saved in his first case at Abbeville, brings in a replica pig which he claims absconded at the time of the killing.  As Courtois leaves, he sees a knight arriving just as Jeannine had foretold. After he has left, the knight takes off his armor to reveal that he bears the characteristic [[bubo]]es of the [[Black Death]].

In the Line of Fire
 [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] Agents Frank Horrigan and Al D'Andrea meet with members of a counterfeiting group at a marina. The group's leader, Mendoza, tells Frank that he has identified D'Andrea as an undercover agent, and forces him to prove his loyalty by putting a gun to D'Andrea's head and pulling the trigger. Frank shoots Mendoza's men, identifies himself as an agent, and arrests the counterfeiter.  Horrigan investigates a complaint from a landlady about an apartment's absent tenant. He finds a collage of photographs and newspaper articles on famous assassinations, a model-building magazine, and a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' cover with the President's head circled. When Frank and his partner return with a search warrant, only one photograph remains, which shows a much younger Frank standing behind John F. Kennedy in Dallas in 1963. Horrigan is the only remaining active agent who was guarding the President that day, and he is wracked with guilt over his failure to react quickly enough to the first shot, shielding Kennedy from the subsequent fatal bullet, which could have saved the President's life. This guilt drove Horrigan to drink excessively; eventually his family left him.  Horrigan receives a phone call from the tenant, who calls himself "Booth". He tells Horrigan that, like [[John Wilkes Booth]] and [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], he plans to kill the President, who is running for reelection and is making many public appearances around the country. Horrigan, despite his age, asks to return to the Presidential Protective Detail, where he begins a relationship with fellow agent Lilly Raines.  Booth continues to call Horrigan as part of his "game," even though he knows that his calls are being traced. He mocks the agent's failure to protect Kennedy but calls him a "friend". Booth escapes Horrigan and D'Andrea after one such call from [[Lafayette Square (Washington, D.C.)|Lafayette Park]], but unknowingly leaves fingerprints in the process. The FBI matches the prints, but because the person's identity is classified, they cannot disclose it to the Secret Service. The FBI does notify the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].  At a campaign event in Chicago, Booth pops a decorative balloon. Horrigan, who has a cold, mistakes the pop for a gunshot. Because of this error, he is removed from the protective detail, but he is left in charge of the Booth case. Horrigan and D'Andrea learn from the CIA that Booth is Mitch Leary, a former assassin who has suffered a mental breakdown and is now a "predator". Leary, who has already killed several people as he prepares for the assassination, uses his model-making skills to build a [[Improvised firearm|zip gun]] out of [[composite material]] to evade metal detectors and hides the bullets and springs in a keyring.  D'Andrea confides to Frank that he is going to retire immediately because of nightmares about the Mendoza incident, but Horrigan is able to dissuade him from doing so. After Leary taunts Frank about the President facing danger in California, the two agents chase him across Washington rooftops, and Leary shoots and kills D'Andrea. Frank asks Raines to reassign him to the protective detail when the President visits Los Angeles, but a television crew films him mistaking a bellboy at the hotel for a security threat, and he must again leave the detail.  Frank connects Leary to a bank employee's murder and learns that Leary, who has made a large campaign contribution, is among the guests at a campaign dinner at the hotel. He sees the President approach Leary and jumps into the path  of the assassin's bullet, saving the President's life. As the Secret Service quickly removes the President, Leary uses Horrigan – who is wearing a bulletproof vest – as a hostage to escape to the hotel's external elevator. Frank uses his earpiece to tell Raines and sharpshooters where to aim; although they miss Leary, Frank defeats him. The would-be-assassin chooses to fall to his death from the elevator.  Frank, now a hero, retires, as his fame makes it impossible for him to do his job. He and Raines find a farewell message from Leary on Frank's answering machine. Frank and Raines leave the house and visit the [[Lincoln Memorial]].

Iron Monkey (1993 film)
 The plot centers on a masked martial artist known as Iron Monkey. Iron Monkey is actually the [[alter ego]] of a [[traditional Chinese medicine]] physician called Yang Tianchun. In the day, Yang runs his clinic and provides free medical treatment for the poor, which he subsidises by charging his rich patients. At night, he dresses in black and travels around town to rob the rich and help the poor. Once, he breaks into the governor's residence and makes off with a hoard of gold. The guards and four [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]] monks are unable to stop him. The governor orders the chief constable, Fox, to hunt down Iron Monkey and to arrest anyone who is linked to him in any way. Fox appears to be a bungler who is not aware that Iron Monkey is actually the physician treating his injured men who fought with Iron Monkey the previous night.  In the meantime, [[Wong Kei-ying]], also a physician and martial artist from [[Foshan]], arrives in town with his young son, [[Wong Fei-hung]]. Wong Kei-ying fights with street thugs who attempt to rob him. Some soldiers who have been observing the fight nearby suspect that Wong is Iron Monkey, and they arrest him and his son. During the trial, the governor orders Wong Fei-hung to be [[Human branding|branded]] for defiance, but Iron Monkey shows up and disrupts the proceedings. Wong Kei-ying is eager to prove his innocence, and he fights with Iron Monkey. Neither of them is able to defeat his opponent, and Iron Monkey escapes. The governor is impressed by Wong Kei-ying's skill, and he holds Wong Fei-hung hostage to force Wong Kei-ying to help him capture Iron Monkey within seven days.  The locals despise Wong Kei-ying for assisting the governor in capturing their hero, so they refuse to sell him food or provide him with shelter. Wong eventually arrives at Yang's clinic and is taken in by Yang and Miss Orchid, while he is still unaware of Yang's true identity. With help from Fox, Yang manages to bring Wong Fei-hung, who has fallen sick, out of prison and keeps him in his clinic. Wong Fei-hung learns new martial arts from Yang and Miss Orchid during his stay with them.  Meanwhile, a Shaolin traitor named Hin-hung, who has become an imperial official, arrives in town with his followers. Hin-hung takes over as the new governor. Iron Monkey and Wong Kei-ying run into Hin-hung and his men in two separate encounters, and they are severely wounded by him. They retreat back to the clinic, where Wong is surprised to discover that Yang is actually Iron Monkey. They assist each other and recover from their wounds quickly. Concurrently, Hin-hung orders his men to search the town for Iron Monkey and Wong Kei-ying, but Fox gets to the clinic first to warn Orchid. It turns out that Fox has known Iron Monkey's true identity all along, and he has been secretly helping Iron Monkey.  Hin-hung's monks eventually find their way to the clinic, and they engage Orchid in a fight. When Orchid proves far too skillful for the monks, they drug her and attempt to rape her. She is saved by Wong Fei-hung, who continues the battle with the monks using the staff movements he learn from Yang and Orchid. Although Wong Fei-hung is able to defeat the Hin-hung's best monks, he is captured and tortured. Orchid escapes to warn Wong Kei-ying and Iron Monkey.  Iron Monkey and Wong Kei-ying (also wearing the Iron Monkey costume) break into the governor's residence to rescue Wong Fei-hung and defeat Hin-hung's men and monks. They have a final confrontation with Hin-hung on top of burning wooden poles. After an intense fight, Iron Monkey and Wong Kei-ying defeat Hin-hung and knock him down into the inferno below. At the end of the film, the protagonists learn that a new governor has taken office, and they hope that he will be a good official. The Wongs leave town for Foshan while Yang and Orchid see them off. Fox says that he would like to visit the Wongs, but that he is too busy "trying to catch that Iron Monkey". After the film, screen captions inform viewers that Yang and Orchid are married, and that Wong Fei-hung, inspired by his father and the Iron Monkey, later becomes a hero among the Chinese and restores honor to the Shaolin Monastery.  
Ironheart
  Ironheart opens at a [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] nightclub (Upfront FX), where Milverstead, who is considered the most powerful and ruthless man in town, and his group of thugs are looking at the female clientele with an approving eye.  Milverstead is shipping illegal arms out of the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] docks, and to sweeten the deals with his trading partners, he kidnaps local lonely dancers, strings them out on [[heroin]], and sends them along in the deal.  He notices Cindy Kane ([[Meagan Hughes]]) dancing furiously to [[U-Krew]]'s hit "If You Were Mine" and decides to kidnap her.  To lure her into his trap, he instructs his young lieutenant Richard ([[Michael Lowry]]) to flirt with her and get her to go with him.  Cindy is ostensibly with her loser boyfriend Stevo ([[Rob Buckmaster]]) at the club, but wants to get him jealous and so leaves with Richard.  Milverstead and his gang leave shortly thereafter.  However, they are being tailed from the club by a new policeman on the Portland force from LA named Douglas ([[David Mountain]]),  Douglas has been tipped to Milverstead's shady dealings and follows everyone to the docks, where most of the gang is now dragging Cindy onto a boat, locking her in a cage and shooting her full of heroin.   At this point, Milverstead's second in command, Ice ([[Bolo Yeung]]) takes some of the gang and lays a trap for Douglas.  They beat Douglas senseless, at which point Ice shoots Douglas in cold blood on a pile of old tires, and also blows up his car with gunfire.  Back in LA, Douglas's old partner John Keem ([[Britton K. Lee]]) is made aware of his partner's untimely death and strangely ordered to Portland to assist the local police in the investigation.  While driving to Portland in a red convertible Porsche, he stops for a sandwich when he notices some men on the beach smoking marijuana and, subsequently, attempting to rape a female jogger.  He goes to investigate when he is charged by a drugged out rapist named Spike, and promptly beats him and the rest of the potential rapists up, saving the jogger's life.  When he goes to check on the woman, she has fled in terror from the bizarre encounter.  Upon reaching Portland, he immediately goes to meet with Captain Kronious ([[Joe Ivy]]), who offers assistance and mentions that a woman also disappeared the same night Douglas was killed, a Cindy Kane.  John goes to talk to Stevo and see if there is perhaps a connection between Cindy's disappearance and Douglas's fateful death.  Milverstead arranges to have Cindy sent overseas with his next shipment, and brags to Ice how pleased he is things are going so smoothly, as he HATES chaos.  John Keem meets up Stevo, who tells him Cindy left with a strange guy from the club, so they go to investigate that night.  Milverstead is there along with his gang, so John Keem stirs things up a bit by starting a fight to get Milverstead's attention when he sees a friend of Cindy named Kristy ([[Karman Kruschke]]) being harassed by a couple young punks.  Puzzled that Ice has never heard of this new heavy hitter, he sets about to find out who exactly John Keem is.  Kristy runs a dance studio, so John Keem decides to pay her a visit the next day and question her about Cindy.  Cindy, unfortunately, became a "tragic dancer's story", where she was talented, but got lazy and started simply dancing at the clubs trying to land a rich guy, leading Stevo on the whole time that he had an actual chance with her.  They go to lunch, where they are interrupted by Stevo (whom Kristy calls "Cherub") who tells John Keem to check out an address given to him by the Captain.  John races off to follow the tip, leaving Stevo to awkwardly hit on Kristy just one day after his girlfriend goes missing.  John finds the address, but when he gets closer to the house to investigate, he sees a bomb planted just inside the window by Milverstead's henchman Simmons ([[Pat Patterson (actor)|Pat Patterson]]) and runs away just as it explodes.  Simmons and his accomplices try to corner John, and they then engage in a wild gun battle where two of the gang are killed and Simmons wings John Keem in the shoulder.  At this moment, Kristy arrives out of nowhere in an old [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and just drives through the middle of the battle, allowing Simmons to escape.  Kristy jumps out of her car and gets in a shouting match with John, who calms her down and blows up her car so it can't be traced.  They drive off together to continue the hunt.  Back on Milverstead's [[boat]], he is relaxing with a drink Ice just made when Simmons arrives.  He quizzes Simmons about whether or not John Kim was dead, and makes him feel guilty about botching the operation so badly.  Simmons sputters out some nonsense about knowing that he shot John Keem, but refuses to answer whether or not he terminated the target.  Disgusted, Milverstead tells Simmons the dead men's blood scream for his, so he has Ice strangle Simmons with his own tie and toss him overboard.  Kristy attends to John Keem's wounds back at her place, when she starts to get emotional.  Unmoved, John Keem listens and then they promptly sleep together with no apparent pre-text other than they were both there.  Stevo is frantically trying to reach John Keem, so he calls Kronious to let him know that Richard, the guy Cindy went home with, works for Milverstead.  He then goes off to complete his route for Hot Flash Pizza.  However, Captain Kronious calls Milverstead with this information, and not John Keem.  Milverstead gets off the phone and asks Ice, who has been bouncing a pencil while awaiting his next order, if he'd like a little "exercise".  Ice throws down the pencil and goes off to find and kill Stevo.  After their [[Human sexuality|sexual]] encounter, John Keem goes off to finish the investigation while Kristy goes to collect her 8 year old [[daughter]] she left at the club with the reception several hours earlier.  John Keem learns that Stevo has been killed, and makes the connection that Milverstead is involved.  He takes the fight to Milverstead by impersonating a homeless man and banging on the door to Milverstead Shipping in downtown [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] to alert the night watchman.  They let him in, and he promptly kills or maims the entire security team and finds evidence to finish Milverstead once and for all.  Milverstead is waiting for him at the club, and offers a bonus to any of his henchman who kills John Keem.  Kristy leaves her daughter at home alone again to try and lure Milverstead out into the open by dancing up a storm at the dance club.  Milverstead knows she is working with John Kim, but decides to kidnap her and send her overseas anyway to punish her for working with him.  Unfortunatetly, John Keem dispatches his henchman with a single punch and quickly follows Milverstead and Ice to the docks.  There he also finds the double-crossing Captain Kronious, and gets him to tell him where Milverstead is before he shoots and kills him.  He then kills off the remaining henchman (besides Ice) and corners a helpless Milverstead.  Wielding a [[samurai]] sword he took off one of the henchman, he chops a sobbing Milverstead's head off and turns to face Ice.  He quickly beats (but does not kill) Ice, avenging his friend's death.  He goes back to LA with Kristy and her daughter to start a new chapter of his life.

Naresh confirms that something happened on 24th which caused this situation, and Ramalakshmi might be one of the persons behind it.  Ramalakshmi also finds that Naresh is a police officer who comes there for investigation. She wants to make him drink the same herb, but she is tricked by Naresh by acting like a woman and marries her. On their first night, Naresh reveals his trick to Ramalakshmi and asks her to reveal the secret behind strange behavior of the people in the city. In a scuffle between them, she was pushed away and accidentally goes into a coma. Before she becomes normal, Naresh and Nagulu enact a drama to trick her that she has gone into the future (year 2092) and make her reveal the secret about Jamba Lakidi Pamba.  Naresh and Nagulu set out to meet Amba and find only her disciple Chidambarananda there. He tells them that she died and he was the one who gave the herb to Ramalakshmi. He also reveals that he found the antidote called ''Pamba Lakidi Jamba'' and accidentally mixed it with ''Jamba Lakidi Pamba''. Because of that, the people transform themselves into mad in five stages. He also explains that he has a final antidote called ''Pamba Jamba Lamba Lakidi''. But before they take it from him, he was kidnapped by Thutala Rani with the help of Ramalakshmi. When they try to trace him, they found that people have reached the second stage in which kids behave like elders and vice versa. When Naresh explains all this to Ramalakshmi, she realizes her mistake and helps Naresh to find out the antidote. While they try to trace Thutala Rani, the third phase also arrives. They found the dressing style, and the voices of all the people have changed. When all the people become mad, they chase them to the den of Thutala Rani, where they find Chidambarananda and make him prepare the antidote. They fight with Thutala Rani and finally mix it in the water and spray them on all the people and everything becomes normal.

Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday
  At Camp Crystal Lake, an undercover government agent lures [[Jason Voorhees]] into a trap set by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and several armed men blow him to bits, destroying his body. His remains are sent to a morgue, where a coroner becomes possessed by Jason's spirit after ingesting Jason's putrid heart. Jason, now in the coroner's body, escapes the morgue, leaving a trail of death.  At Crystal Lake, he finds three partying teens. While two of them have sex, Jason kills the third, then the other two. Jason attacks two police officers, killing one and possessing the other. Meanwhile, bounty hunter Creighton Duke discovers only members of Jason's bloodline can truly kill him, and he will return to his normal and near-invincible state if he possesses a member of his family. The only living relatives of Jason are his half-sister Diana Kimble, her daughter Jessica, and Stephanie, the infant daughter of Jessica and Steven Freeman.  Jason makes his way to Diana's house. Steven bursts in and attacks Jason. Diana is killed and Jason escapes. Steven is falsely accused and arrested for Diana's murder and meets Duke, who reveals Jessica's relation to Jason. Determined to get to Jessica before Jason does, Steven escapes from jail. Jessica is dating tabloid TV reporter Robert Campbell. Steven goes to the Voorhees house to find evidence to convince Jessica but falls through rotten boards. Robert enters the upstairs room and receives a phone call which reveals that he is attempting to "spice up" his show's ratings by putting emphasis on Jason's return from death, having stolen Diana's body from the morgue for this reason. Jason bursts in and transfers his heart into Robert, while the body he left melts. Jason leaves with Steven in pursuit. Jason attempts to be reborn through Jessica but is disrupted by Steven, who hits him and takes Jessica into his car. Steven stalls Jason by running him over. When he tries to explain the situation to Jessica, she disbelieves him and throws him out of the car. Jessica goes to the police station.  Jason arrives at the police station and kills most of the officers. He nearly possesses Jessica before Steven stops him; Jessica realizes Steven is right. In the chaos, Duke makes his escape. Jessica and Steven make their way to the diner to grab the baby. Jason arrives but is attacked by the owners of the shop. He kills the owners but is injured by waitress Vicki, who shoots him with a shotgun then impales him with an iron rod, but then impales her on the same rod before crushing her head, killing her. Jason is presumably killed, and Jessica and Steven discover a note from Duke, telling them that he has the baby and demands that Jessica meet him at the Voorhees house alone.  Jessica meets Duke at the Voorhees house and is given a mystical dagger which she can use to permanently kill Jason. A police officer enters the diner where Robert, possessed, transfers his heart into him. Duke falls through the floor, and Jessica is confronted by Landis and Randy. Landis is killed accidentally with the dagger, and Jessica drops the dagger. Randy, possessed, attempts to be reborn through Stephanie, but Steven arrives and severs his neck with a machete. Jason's heart, which has grown into a demonic infant, crawls out of Randy's neck to Diana's dead body in the basement. Steven and Jessica pull Duke out of the basement as Jason discovers Diana's body and slithers up her vagina, allowing him to be reborn.  While Steven and Jessica attempt to retrieve the dagger, Duke distracts Jason and is killed with a [[bear hug]] (though it is later revealed in 2018 that Duke retroactively survived,as per a producer from this film.) Jason turns his attention to Jessica, and Steven tackles Jason, who both fight outside while Jessica retrieves the dagger. Jason badly brutalizes Steven and when he is about to kill him, Jessica stabs Jason in the chest, releasing the souls Jason accumulated over time. Demonic hands burst out of the ground and pull Jason into the depths of Hell. Steven and Jessica reconcile and walk off into the sunrise with their baby. Later a dog unearths Jason's mask while digging in the dirt. [[Freddy Krueger|Freddy Krueger's]] gloved hand bursts out of the dirt and pulls Jason's mask into the ground.

Stuck in traffic, Ray decides to make up for lost time by exiting the expressway and search out a shortcut through a poor [[residential area|residential]] neighborhood. The four friends are alarmed when they [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit]] a man named Teddy ([[Michael DeLorenzo]]), who they take into the RV. They find that he has been shot, and that he has a paper bag filled with money. The group sees a police car and begins pursuing it.  They are unable to catch up and their RV is side-swiped by a Cadillac. The impact forces them into a narrow alleyway, leaving the RV stuck between two brick walls and unable to start. Moments later, three unknown men shatter the back window and drag Teddy out. Still inside the RV, the four friends witness gang leader Fallon ([[Denis Leary]]) shoot and kill Teddy. Fallon reminds the gang that policy is to leave no witnesses. As the criminals approach the RV, Frank sets it on fire, and all four escape through the front window.  The four friends hide and try to outrun the gang until they think they have gotten away. They head to a railyard, followed by Fallon and his gang. While hiding inside the car of an old train, Frank and his friends are blackmailed by homeless men living in the train, who threaten to alert their pursuers to their location unless they pay them. The friends comply, but one of the homeless men freaks out when Mike won't give him his jacket. Fallon and his gang are leaving the railyard when they hear shouting coming from the railcar. As they open the car everyone aboard jumps off and starts running. Fallon accidentally shoots a homeless guy (who he thought was Mike by the jacket), but recovers Frank's wallet and now knows where he lives.  The guys find an apartment building with an open door and run inside. A local boy on the swingset outside of the building spots the guys, who then runs off to tell his friends. The group of local kids, who are protecting their neighbourhood, confront Fallon and his gang, believing them to be the group they are looking for. Fallon pays the group off to find out which building they ran into. While inside the building, Frank and his friends hole up in the apartment of two women and a child and they call the police. Fallon and his gang terrorize the building's tenants. Hearing this, the women demand that Frank and his friends leave, suggesting that they head to the roof to escape. Mike, John, and Frank manage to cross over to the neighboring building with the use of a ladder bridge. Because of Ray's fear of heights, and the unsteadiness of the ladder at that point, he decides to throw the ladder down and stay behind to pay Fallon off. However, Fallon pushes him off the roof, falling to his death.  Escaping into the sewers, Mike suggests that they fight back against their pursuers. Sykes ([[Peter Greene]]), Fallon's best friend and right-hand man, catches up with them, and after a brief confrontation is shot and killed by Mike. Frank chooses not to risk their lives anymore, so they escape from the sewer and keep running. Within the sewer, the remaining members of Fallon's gang find the body of Sykes. A comment made by one of the gang members annoys Fallon and he (whether accidentally or not) drowns him.  Searching for help, the guys find a [[Flea market|swap meet]] and Mike breaks a window in the hopes it will trigger the alarm and bring the police. Shortly afterwards, they realize that Fallon has found them once more. The last remaining member of Fallon's gang, Rhodes ([[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]]) is shot dead by Mike, but in the process Mike is shot in the stomach. John goes to help Mike but Fallon shoots him in the leg. Frank leads the wounded Mike and John to a bathroom closet where they hide. Frank gets to the security office and activates a silent alarm.

The Joy Luck Club (film)
   The Joy Luck Club was formed by four women in [[San Francisco]]: Lindo Jong ([[Tsai Chin (actress)|Tsai Chin]]), Ying-Ying St. Clair ([[France Nuyen]]), An-Mei Hsu ([[Lisa Lu]]), and Suyuan Woo ([[Kieu Chinh]]). The members have mainly played [[mahjong]] and told each other's stories over the years. They emigrated from their native country, China, remarried, and gave birth to [[Chinese American|children in America]]. Suyuan's daughter June ([[Ming-Na Wen]]) replaced her when Suyuan died four months before the time the film is set. The mothers have high hopes for their daughters' success, but the daughters struggle through "anxieties, feelings of inadequacy, and failures." Throughout the film, the mothers and daughters bond by learning to understand each other and by overcoming their conflicts.<ref></ref>  The film begins with June's prologue tale. In the prologue, a woman (presumably Suyuan) bought a swan in China from a market vendor who was selling it as "a duck that stretched its neck [to become] a goose." She kept it as her pet and brought it to the United States. When the immigration officials took it away from her, she plucked out only a swan feather instead while she struggled to grab the swan away. For a long time, the woman had kept the feather, planning to someday give the feather to her daughter.  Then the film [[film transition|transits]] to June's farewell surprise party in San Francisco for her upcoming reunion with her long-lost twin sisters in China. Among the guests are members of The Joy Luck Club, their daughters, other relatives, and friends. The following characters below narrate their journeys to the audience while they reflect upon their pasts.  ===Lindo and Waverly Jong=== In China, four-year-old Lindo (Ying Wu) is arranged, by her mother ([[Xi Meijuan]]) and the matchmaker (Hsu Ying Li), to be married to Mrs. Huang's son when she grows up. When Lindo turns fifteen ([[Irene Ng]]), her mother sends her to Mrs. Huang, so Lindo marries Huang's son, Tyan Hu (William Gong), a pre-pubescent boy who has no interest in her. During four years of childless and loveless marriage, she is frequently abused by her frustrated mother-in-law, who believes Lindo's childlessness is her own fault. Lindo eavesdrops on the servant girl telling her lover that she is pregnant and he willfully abandons her. Lindo realizes her chance to leave the marriage without dishonoring herself, her family and her in-laws. Later, Lindo purportedly ruins her clothes and then claims that she had a nightmare in which Tyan Hu's ancestors threatened to punish her, Tyan Hu and the matchmaker. Then Lindo claims that the ancestors impregnated the servant girl with Tyan Hu's child and her own marriage to him is considered offensive to them. Mrs. Huang does not believe Lindo until Mrs. Huang quickly discovers the servant's pregnancy through inspection. Finally, Lindo claims that the matchmaker intentionally and wrongly paired Lindo and Tyan Hu for more money. Furious, Mrs. Huang orders the matchmaker out of her family's life, allowing the servant girl to have her marriage. Lindo is able to escape the house and moves to [[Shanghai]].  Years later in America, Lindo has a new husband, a son, and is going to [[Interracial marriage in the United States#Asian and White|marry a Caucasian fiancé]], Rich ([[Christopher Rich (actor)|Christopher Rich]]), much to Lindo's chagrin. In order to make Lindo like Rich, Waverly brings him to a family dinner, but he fails to impress them especially by improperly using chopsticks and insulting Lindo's cooking by marinating the dish with a sauce, humiliating Waverly. While driving home, Waverly lets Rich know how humiliated she and her family are with him, prompting him to properly learn the Chinese table manners. A while later, at the hair salon, Lindo retells her moments with her own mother and declares that she likes Rich very much. She then gives marital blessings to Waverly and Rich, prompting her and Waverly to reconcile with each other. At June's farewell party, Rich almost successfully uses a chopstick (but accidentally drops a piece), impressing Lindo by trying to respect the Chinese table manners.  ===Ying-Ying and Lena St. Clair=== In China, Ying-Ying St. Clair was happily married to Lin-Xiao ([[Russell Wong]]) with a baby boy in China until Lin-Xiao abuses her and abandons her for an opera singer. Overcome by her depression, Ying-Ying drowns her baby son in the bathtub, which leaves her distraught afterwards because she feels that if she had killed Lin-Xiao earlier, she would not have lost "the thing that mattered the most." Years after she immigrated to America, she has suffered from trauma and has been haunted by her past, worrying her new family, including her daughter Lena ([[Lauren Tom]]).  After Ying-Ying finally resolved her years of trauma, Lena shows Ying-Ying around her new apartment with her husband Harold ([[Michael Paul Chan]]), who is also Lena's boss. Ying-Ying learns that Lena is uncomfortable with her financial arrangements with Harold. They split the costs of their life evenly with a list of things that they share, making their home life contentious. Seeing that Lena is unhappy with her marriage, Ying-Ying reasserts herself by knocking over a table in the bedroom and causing the vase to fall from the table and break. Hearing the sudden noise, Lena goes to her mother and admits her unhappiness. Ying-Ying replies that Lena should leave and not come back until Harold gives her what she wants. At June's farewell party, Lena is shown to have a new vibrant fiancé, who has given Lena what she wants and is accepting of Ying-Ying.  ===An-Mei and Rose Hsu=== Nine-year-old An-Mei Hsu ([[Yi Ding (actress)|Yi Ding]]) has been raised with her relatives and grandmother. She is reunited with her long-lost mother ([[Vivian Wu]]), who was disowned by her family for her "[[affair|dalliance]]" with a wealthy middle-aged man Wu-Tsing shortly after her husband's death, and who arrives to see her dying mother ([[Lucille Soong]]). In order to not lose her again, An-Mei moves out with her mother to Wu-Tsing's house against her relatives' wishes for her to remain with them. They claim that in allowing An-Mei live with her and Wu-Tsing, the mother will ruin her future. She finds that Wu-Tsing has another three wives, making An-Mei's mother [[Concubinage|the Fourth Wife]]. Later, she learns that the Second Wife ([[Elizabeth Sung]]) tricked An-Mei's mother into being raped and impregnated by Wu-Tsing. When the relatives did not believe An-Mei's mother and kicked her out, she reluctantly became Wu-Tsing's Fourth Wife as she had nowhere else to turn. After An-Mei's mother gave birth to a boy, the Second Wife took him away from her and claimed him as her own. After An-Mei discovers the past, her mother ultimately commits suicide by eating "[[Tangyuan (food)|sticky rice balls]]" laced with [[opium]], choosing the day of her death carefully to threaten Wu-Tsing with the vengeance of her angry ghost. Afraid of this curse, Wu-Tsing vows to raise An-Mei and her half-brother with great care and promises to honor their mother as an honorable first wife. When Second Wife tries to pay respects to An-Mei's late mother, An-Mei screams at the Second Wife, destroys the Second Wife's faux pearl necklace (the Second Wife initially tried to win An-Mei over with a similar necklace), and loudly yells out "Mama!"  Years later in America, An-Mei's daughter Rose ([[Rosalind Chao]]) has been dating her boyfriend, Ted Jordan ([[Andrew McCarthy]]) since college. Ted is initially attracted to Rose's assertive, forthright nature. When he confronts his aristocratic mother ([[Diane Baker]]) for insulting Rose due to her race, Rose is impressed and agrees to marry him. Over the course of their marriage, however, Rose and Ted become distant from each other, mainly because Rose, desperate to prove herself to Ted's milieu, becomes submissive and demure at the cost of her own identity and interests. They have a daughter, Jennifer, but this does not resolve their marital problems. To make matters worse, Ted cheats on her with another woman and neither are actually happy in their marriage. A while later, An-Mei comes for a visit and relays the story of her own mother's fate to Rose. She encourages Rose to stand up for herself and Jennifer against Ted, or nothing will change. To avoid the same fate, Rose reclaims her strength and stands up to Ted by telling him to leave the house and not take their daughter away from her. This compels Ted to take her seriously and not continue taking her for granted. At June's farewell party, it is revealed the couple have reconciled.  ===Suyuan and June Woo=== In [[World War II]], when [[Operation Ichi-Go|the Japanese invaded China]], Suyuan Woo escaped the invasion with her twin baby daughters. When Suyuan became ill during her quest for refuge, her cart breaks down, causing the babies to fall. Near death, Suyuan was unable to carry the babies herself and abandoned them along with all of her other possessions, including a photo of herself. Suyuan survived, but was haunted by guilt in the loss of her daughters and never knew what happened to them.  After she remarried in America, Suyuan has high hopes for her new daughter June, but June constantly fails to meet her expectations out of a lack of interest. She performs badly during a piano recital at age nine (Melanie Chang), and when Suyuan pushes her to continue training to be a concert pianist, June refuses, saying that she wishes herself dead like Suyuan's other daughters, an action that offends Suyuan. When June grows into adulthood, at a dinner party a year before Suyuan's passing, Waverly, June's long-time rival whom she is freelancing for, turns down her business ideas, and Suyuan remarks that Waverly and June are not alike, and that ''style'' is something one's born with and cannot be taught implying Waverly has ''style''. June feels humiliated, believing her mother had betrayed her for being a failure in her eyes, and Lindo shows sympathy for June. The following day, June berates Suyuan for her remarks and admits she could never live up to her high expectations. June laments that Suyuan has always been disappointed in June because June dropped out of college, is not married, and has an unsuccessful career. However, Suyuan gives her a [[Chinese jade|jade]] necklace and assures June that she is the one who has the unteachable ''style'' and that while Waverly was the best in competitions, June always had the best heart, which made her mother prouder than she would have been otherwise.  Last [[Easter]] before the farewell party, June received the news from the Club that the long-lost twins were alive. When June could not understand the twins' letter [[Chinese language|written in Chinese]], Lindo purportedly mistranslated the letter to make June believe that the twins knew about Suyuan's death and their long-lost half-sister June. Back to the present, when the farewell party ends, Lindo confesses that she wrote letters to the twins and then signed [[Chinese name|Suyuan's name]]. June begs Lindo to tell them the truth, but Lindo tells her that it is too late because the twin sisters are anticipating their mother, Suyuan, still believing that Suyuan is alive. A short while later, June's father ([[Chao-Li Chi]]) retells the war story of Suyuan and her long-lost twin daughters. Then he gives her the swan feather, which came from Suyuan's—the woman's—swan as explained earlier in the prologue, saying that the feather looks worthless but has "good intentions." When she arrives in China to meet her sisters, June tells them the truth about Suyuan and embraces them. In finally accepting her Chinese heritage, June is able to make peace with her deceased mother.

Jurassic Park (film)
  Industrialist John Hammond and his [[Biological engineering|bioengineering]] company, InGen, have created a [[Animal theme park|theme park]] of cloned dinosaurs called Jurassic Park on [[Isla Nublar]], a Costa Rican island. After one of the dinosaur handlers is killed by a ''[[Velociraptor]]'', the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand that experts visit the park and certify it is safe. Gennaro invites [[mathematician]] and [[chaos theory|chaos theorist]] Ian Malcolm, while Hammond invites [[paleontologist]] Dr. Alan Grant and [[paleobotanist]] Dr. Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see a live ''[[Brachiosaurus]]''.  At the park's visitor center, the group learns that the cloning was accomplished by extracting [[Ancient DNA|dinosaur DNA]] from [[mosquito]]es preserved in [[amber]]. DNA from [[frog]]s was used to fill in gaps in the [[genome]] of the dinosaurs. To prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female. Malcolm scoffs at the idea, saying that it will inevitably break down. The group witnesses the hatching of a baby ''[[Velociraptor]]'' and visits the raptor enclosure. During a luncheon, the group debates the [[ethics of cloning]] and the creation of the park, with Dr. Malcolm giving a harsh warning about the implications of [[genetic engineering]] as a whole.  The group is then joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim Murphy, for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees the tour from the park's control room. The tour does not go as planned, with most of the dinosaurs failing to appear and the group encountering a sick ''[[Triceratops]]''. It is cut short as a [[Tropical cyclone|tropical storm]] approaches Isla Nublar. Most of the park employees leave for the mainland on a boat while the visitors return to their electric tour vehicles, except Sattler, who stays behind with the park's veterinarian to study the ''Triceratops''.  Jurassic Park's lead computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, has been bribed by Dodgson, a man working for Hammond's corporate rival, to steal fertilized dinosaur [[embryo]]s. Nedry deactivates the park's security system to gain access to the embryo storage room and stores the embryos inside a canister disguised as a shaving cream bottle. The power goes out and the tour vehicles become stuck because of it. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated as well, allowing the park's ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' to escape and attack the group. Grant, Lex, and Tim escape, while the ''Tyrannosaurus'' injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro. On his way to deliver the embryos to the island's docks, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his [[Jeep Wrangler]], and is killed by a ''[[Dilophosaurus]]''.  Sattler helps the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon, search for survivors, but they only find Malcolm, just before the ''Tyrannosaurus'' returns. Grant, Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop. They later discover the broken shells of dinosaur eggs. Grant concludes that the dinosaurs have been breeding, which occurred because of their frog DNA—[[African bullfrog|West African bullfrogs]] can change their sex in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well, proving Malcolm right.  Unable to decipher Nedry's code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and the park's chief engineer Ray Arnold reboot the park's system. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats to an emergency bunker, while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When Arnold fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the ''Velociraptors''. Muldoon distracts the raptors, while Sattler goes to turn the power back on, before being attacked by a raptor and discovering Arnold's severed arm. Meanwhile, Muldoon is caught off-guard and killed by the other two raptors.  Grant, Tim and Lex reach the visitor center. Grant heads out to look for Sattler, leaving Tim and Lex inside. Tim and Lex are pursued by the raptors in an industrial kitchen, but they escape and join Grant and Sattler. Lex restores full power from the control room, allowing them to call Hammond, who in turn calls for help. They are cornered by the raptors, but they escape when the ''Tyrannosaurus'' suddenly appears and kills the raptors. Hammond arrives in a jeep with Malcolm, and all of them board a helicopter to leave the island.  
Kalaignan
  The story revolves around a Tamil pop singer Inderjeet based in Bangalore who has a large female following. The movie opens with the death of a back-up dancer, Sandhya, in Inderjeet's group. Soon a police detective is put in charge of the investigation. Although the police suspect Inderjeet as he is very short-tempered, they have no evidence linking him to the crime. Meanwhile, Divya, Sandhya's sister, arrives at her aunt Dr. Prabhavathy’s house to find out the truth about Sandhya's death. She goes to meet Inderjeet but is put off by his arrogance. She talks to his manager, Dr. Harichandra Prasad, and other musicians who all have differing opinions about Sandhya.  While investigating, Divya is attacked in a bar. Coincidentally, Inderjeet saves her and takes her to his concert. During the concert, Inderjeet gets flashes of his parents' and sister's deaths in an accident during his childhood and breaks down in tears. At the end of the concert, Jennifer, a fan, gets on stage and kisses him to the bemusement of all. That night, Jennifer is killed by someone wearing Inderjeet’s coat. With no concrete evidence, the police keep a closer eye on Inderjeet and find that Divya seems to have an interest in him. To warn her, the police detective reveals that Inderjeet is a possible suspect in Sandhya's death.  Divya plans to outwit Inderjeet with the help of Sandhya’s friends, who attacked her earlier in the bar. She feigns to have fallen for Inderjeet and she stages a kidnapping to test Inderjeet’s knife skills (all the women murdered were skilfully cut by the murderer). He is quite good with a knife. But the next day, Inderjeet sees Divya with the bandaged kidnapper walking out of the hospital and determines that she was faking her love.  He comes clean to her about Sandhya. She was an unstable substance abuser who had a thing for him, but he did not reciprocate. She had threatened to commit suicide if he did not reciprocate. He managed to save her and that was the last he had seen of her. The killer, who has pictures that look incriminating, has been blackmailing him into coming to the murder scenes just minutes after the murders. Divya believes him and falls for him.  One afternoon, while with Divya, the killer calls and demands Inderjeet to come or he will kill another person. He refuses as he has had enough and tells the killer that he can tell the truth to the police even if the pictures are given to them. But Divya slips away and goes to that location. Inderjeet, worrying about her, goes to the location with Dr. Prabhavathy. The car stalls, leaving Inderjeet to pursue Divya and the killer on foot and leaving Dr. Prabhavathy alone in the forest.  The killer’s next victim is Dr. Prabhavathy. The killer stabs her till she nearly dies, takes a picture of her unconscious body, and leaves. Divya arrives and calls the police. Inderjeet arrives and notices that the police have found one of his gloves at the murder scene, making him their suspect. He escapes to his manager’s house. The police arrive at the manager’s house, and he asks Inderjeet to hide in the closet. Inderjeet finds a jacket similar to his in the closet and a match to the glove found at the murder scene. He realizes that his manager is the killer and flees. The manager sneakily leads the police to his closet but finds Inderjeet gone.  Inderjeet calls his manager and impersonates a forest official who has photographed the murder earlier and asks for money. He specifies a location and asks the manager to get there soon. He enters the house when the manager leaves and looks around. He finds a secret room filled with photographs of the victims. He calls the manager again and makes him run to another location. After that, he reveals his identity and says that he now has proof of his innocence since the killer's reflection is on the car window when he took the photograph earlier. Shocked, the manager stumbles out but runs into Divya. He kidnaps her and tells Inderjeet to come to an abandoned house with the photographs.  The police spot Inderjeet and chase him. Meanwhile, the manager tells Divya that he started the killings because Sandhya had once turned his request for love down and laughed at him for being a lesser man than Inderjeet. He killed her and the other women who had liked Inderjeet in a jealous rage. Inderjeet escapes the police and rescues Divya. The manager is killed in the ensuing fracas with Inderjeet, and the police find the truth. The police detective says that Dr. Prabhavathy has survived the attack and is recovering in the hospital. The movie ends with Inderjeet and Divya riding happily on a motorcycle.  
Justice (1993 film)
 Isaak Kohler ([[Maximilian Schell]]) coolly walked up to a man everyone assumed was his friend and shot him dead. This took place in front of dozens of witnesses in a busy restaurant, and there was no question about his guilt. What he never revealed was his motive. He has been in prison serving a twenty-year sentence ever since. Perhaps in order to ease his daughter's pain about the incident, he has hired a legal representative to arrange for him to receive a retrial. He is still unforthcoming about his reasons for committing the crime, and invites the struggling lawyer to make something up. This crime and courtroom drama is based on a novel by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, whose works are highly respected within the German-speaking intellectual community but whose appeal has proved difficult to translate.

Ram shows compassion to Ballu while trying to get information that would lead to capture of Ballu's boss and mentor, Roshida. Ballu does not speak, and he promises to escape from the jail. Ballu escapes from the jail, while Ram is visiting his girlfriend, Ganga ([[Madhuri Dixit]]), who is also a police officer. When news of this breaks out, Ram's reputation is in tatters as the media portrays Ram as an officer who has neglected his duty. Ganga, in an attempt to restore Ram's reputation, goes undercover as a street-girl. Ganga realizes that Ballu is a kind-hearted person who turned to crime due to poverty and circumstances, and she tries to rehabilitate him while on the run. Meanwhile, Ballu begins to fall in love with Ganga. He becomes enraged when he finds out she doesn't love him and is a police officer. Ganga continues to help Ballu as she has seen good in him. Meanwhile, Ram approaches Ballu's mother for help and realises that Ballu is, in fact, his childhood friend. Ballu's mother and Ballu then tell Ram and Ganga, respectively, the story of how Roshida used their poverty to corrupt Ballu. Roshida killed Ballu's sister, and put the blame on the police. Ballu kills the officer he believes to be behind this and from then on spirals into a life of crime.   Ganga, afraid that police will kill Ballu, stops the police from shooting him, allowing him to escape. She is hence arrested for aiding a criminal and is accused of being in a relationship with Ballu, which destroys her professional and personal reputation. Ballu's mother finds him, while she is followed by Ram. In the following confrontation, Ballu's mother takes Ram's side trying to convince Ballu to give himself up. Ballu, seeing Ganga's picture in Ram's wallet realizes that this is who she loves. Ballu manages to escape to Roshida's base where Roshida promises to help him escape, but betrays him and attempts to kill him and his mother. The police, led by Ram, attack Roshida's lair. In the ensuing conflict, Ballu finds out that Roshida killed his sister. Ram kills Roshida and Ballu escapes.  Following Roshida's death, Ballu installs himself as the new boss - but his girlfriend informs him that Ganga is about to go on trial for aiding him. Having a change of heart, Ballu appears to attack the court, but then surrenders himself and swears that Ganga is innocent, thereby restoring her reputation and reconciling her and Ram.  
Kika (film)
 Kika ([[Veronica Forqué]]), a naïve make-up artist, recalls how she met her lover Ramón ([[Alex Casanovas]]).  She had given her phone number to his step-father, American writer Nicholas Pierce ([[Peter Coyote]]), and he had called her not for sex as she had hoped but to make up the younger man’s corpse.  He was however merely catatonic and suddenly awoke. Ramón is a fashion photographer with voyeuristic tendencies who was traumatised by his mother’s suicide after several attempts.   He lets Nicholas, who has returned to Madrid, live above their flat and the two discuss whether to sell the family home outside of town, Casa Youkali, which they jointly own.  Ramón proposes to Kika, who accepts but feels conflicted as she has been cheating on him with Nicholas.   Nicholas is working on a novel about a lesbian serial killer, but he makes ends meet by freelancing discreetly for an outrageously exploitative television show which focuses on bizarre and macabre events.  The show is devised and presented by Andrea Caracortada ("Andrea Scarface", played by [[Victoria Abril]]), who wears over-the-top outfits and a persona to match.  Andrea used to be a psychologist, and Ramón was once her patient, then her lover.  He tells Nicholas that she scarred her own face when he left her and she is now stalking him.   On her show, Andrea reports that Paul Bazzo, a dim-witted sex maniac and former pornographic actor jailed for rapes has escaped while attending a religious procession.  He turns up at Ramón and Kika’s flat because their maid Juana ([[Rossy de Palma]]) is his long-suffering sister.  Juana instructs him to tie her up, knock her unconscious and steal valuables, then hide at a cousin’s place.  Paul however finds Kika napping and rapes her at knife point.  An unseen [[voyeurism|voyeur]] peeping at Kika’s room notifies the police and two incompetent inspectors eventually turn up, shoot up the door and with great difficulty interrupt the rape.  Paul escapes and bumps into Andrea, kitted out in a futuristic reporter’s outfit complete with helmet-mounted video camera.  She wants an interview but he pushes her off and steals her motorcycle.  She then enters the flat and harasses Kika.  The police are puzzled at her presence, because although they often tip her off, they did not in this case.  Andrea credits an unknown peeping tom for alerting her and broadcasts video footage of the rape on her show, causing Kika to break down.    In the aftermath, Kika finds Ramón to be no help and she overhears him confess to Nicholas that it was he who called the police: he liked to peep on her from his photographic studio's window.  She leaves him in silence, as does a guilt-wracked Juana who confesses her part in the rape.  Ramón meanwhile also tells Nicholas that he has held on to his mother’s diaries but never found the strength to read them.  He does so however, after Nicholas has moved back to Casa Youkali, and discovers that the farewell letter to him that Nicholas had passed on was actually ripped from an old entry.  Ramón confronts Nicholas and accuses him of murdering his mother.    Meanwhile, it turns out that Andrea and Ramón both spied on the flat from separate addresses.  While reviewing footage of the upper floor, Andrea realises that Nicholas appears to have murdered one of his several girlfriends, Susana (Bibí Andersen) when she visited him.  Connecting this to his latest book, she also goes to Casa Youkali armed with a pistol and finds a freshly dug grave in the garden.  Nicholas barricades himself but she breaks in aggressively and offers to interview him and let him run away before the broadcast.  They fight and shoot each other.  Kika also turns up and Nicholas confesses with his dying breath that his novel about a lesbian serial killer is really a disguised autobiography, as Andrea had worked out.  Kika also finds the bodies of Andrea, Susana and Ramón, but she is able to resurrect the latter a second time with electric shocks.   Ramón had gone into shock after finding Susana's body in the bathroom.  While Ramón is taken to hospital, Kika picks up a stranded motorist and takes an instant interest in him, stating that she might need a new direction.

Last Action Hero
  Danny Madigan is a teenager living in a crime-ridden area of New York City with his widowed mother, Irene. Following the death of his father, Danny takes comfort in watching action movies, especially those featuring the indestructible Los Angeles cop Jack Slater, at his local movie theater owned by Nick, who also acts as the projectionist. Nick gives Danny a golden ticket once owned by [[Harry Houdini]], to see an early preview of the latest ''Jack Slater'' film before its official release.  During the film, the ticket stub magically transports Danny inside the fictional world of the film, interrupting Slater in the middle of a car chase. After escaping their pursuers, Slater takes Danny to the LAPD headquarters, where Danny points out the fictional nature of the world, such as the presence of a cartoon cat detective named Whiskers, and that Slater's friend John Practice is played by the same actor who was the antagonist that killed [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] from ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' and shouldn't be trusted; Slater takes these as part of Danny's wild imagination. Slater's supervisor, Dekker, assigns Danny as his new partner, and instructs them to investigate criminal activities related to mobster Tony Vivaldi.  Danny guides Slater to Vivaldi's mansion, having recognized its location from the start of the film. There, they meet Vivaldi and his henchman, Mr. Benedict. Danny explains the criminal deeds that the two had carried out from the film, but Slater has no evidence, and they are forced to leave; however, Benedict is curious as to how Danny knew of what transpired, and he and several hired guns follow Slater and Danny back to Slater's home. There, Slater, his daughter Whitney, and Danny, thwart the attack, though Benedict ends up getting the ticket stub. He discovers its ability to transport him out of the film.

Learning that Vivaldi's plan has failed, Benedict kills him, and uses the stub to escape into the real world, pursued by Slater and Danny.  Slater becomes despondent upon learning the truth, as well as his mortality in the real world, but cheers up after spending some time with Irene. Meanwhile, Benedict devises a plan to kill [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], the one portraying Slater in the film, from which he then can bring other villains from other films into the real world and take over. To help, Benedict brings the Ripper, the villain of the previous Jack Slater movie, to assassinate Schwarzenegger. Danny and Slater learn of this, and race to the premiere. Slater saves Schwarzenegger, electrocutes the Ripper, and after a decisive battle, kills Benedict by shooting his explosive [[glass eye]]; however, this also causes the stub to be destroyed. With Slater losing blood, Danny knows that the only way to save him is to return him to the fictional world, since he is indestructible there. The figure of [[Death personification|Death]] from the film ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'', who had previously escaped his film, appears to Danny, and suggests that he searches for the other stub of the ticket. Danny finds the stub, and is able to take Slater back into the film, with his wounds instantly healing. Danny returns to the real world before the portal closes. A recovered Slater then enthusiastically embraces the true nature of his reality when he talks to Dekker about his new plan, appreciating the differences between it and the "real" world.

However, when a robbery goes horribly wrong, resulting in the unit being shot up badly, with Loomis (Quinn) badly wounded, they find themselves pursued by [[Marshal]] Sharp, who is capable and respected.  Graff makes the command decision to kill the injured Loomis so that he won't delay their escape. Eustis objects, and when Graff strikes Eustis then moves to shoot Loomis, Eustis instead shoots Graff. Graff falls out of his saddle and rolls down a hillside; thinking he is dead, Eustis takes command and leads the band toward [[Mexico]], with the [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] still in pursuit.  Marshal Sharp and the posse come upon the slightly wounded Graff, and take him prisoner. With Graff in chains, they continue their chase. Eustis sets up an [[ambush]] and several posse members are killed. During the chaos Graff kills Marshal Sharp. Now leaderless, the remaining men decide to return home. Banker McClintock reminds them that they will receive no reward money if they leave. Graff suggests that anyone who stays should take the reward share of those who leave; the men ask if that includes the share of those who were just killed.  McClintock reluctantly says yes. With Graff now their leader, they set up an ambush. Graff shoots and kills Philo (Buscemi). A member of the posse tries to cut off Philo's trigger finger for a trophy. Graff puts his gun to the man's lips and tells him that because Philo was one of his (Graff's) men, everyone will show the proper respect.   Wills (McGinley) grabs the stolen money off Eustis' horse and rides back to leave it for the posse, believing this gesture will end the chase. When McClintock rides up to the spot on the hill where Wills leaves the money, Graff follows and throws both the money and the banker off the cliff. He then fires his guns to make it seem like there has been a shootout with the outlaws, and he tells the posse the situation had been a trap.  Graff stands by as the posse engages in an internal shootout over what to do next. While Potts (Levine) is giving Wills a beating for his action concerning the money, it becomes clear that the deed did not 'save their skins', as Lovecraft (David) spots Graff and his remaining riders coming toward them. Eustace and Graff meet in an isolated saloon, but no peace is brokered. Graff says that Eustace owes him 'everything.'   Potts challenges Eustis' ability as a commander, but Eustis beats him in a fist fight. As the outlaws continue trekking to Mexico, Graff shoots Loomis from a hilltop.  The others take cover behind rocks, but Loomis is left in the open; Graff tortures him, shooting him in different parts of the body every few seconds.  Finally, Eustace is forced to put Loomis out of his misery.  Later, the remaining outlaws encounter Graff almost as if he is a [[ghost]], keeping them off-balance and nervous. During one of these encounters, Graff shoots Wills' horse.  Wills rides with Lovecraft, but the horse cannot take the weight.  Eustis decides it is necessary to leave Wills behind.  Wills waits for the posse and stands his ground as long as he can,killing a couple of them before he is killed.   The three left briefly split up to investigate the whereabouts of Graff and his gang.  Lovecraft chances upon Graff, who gives him extra ammunition, telling him he will be spared if he kills Eustis.  When they reunite and Eustis gives Lovecraft ammunition to load his pistol, he finds that Lovecraft already has a full chamber. Eustis, knowing that Lovecraft did not have a full six rounds left, realizes that Lovecraft has betrayed him. However, when Eustis presses for Lovecraft to do what Graff sent him to do, Lovecraft is overwhelmed with fear and guilt, and commits [[suicide]].  Eustis and Potts make for the [[Rio Grande]], but as they are about to cross, Graff shoots Potts through the gut.  Eustis makes a lone, final stand against the posse. He gets hit, but kills all of them except Graff. The two draw, and Eustis is faster, but his gun is empty. As Graff approaches, Eustis shoots him with a pocket [[derringer]], which Graff had not counted on. Eustis crosses into Mexico, the last outlaw.

The scene cuts to the train station ahead, where the waiting family set up a fire as they wait across the tracks from the train station while a Hungarian woman and her young son wait on a bench. The boy, seeing that his mother is sad and cold, ventures over to the Roma, who strike up the music and cheer the woman up before their family on the train arrive and they walk away singing. *Slovakia—The train screetches along a barbed wire fence as an old woman sings a song about [[Auschwitz]] and the camera pans down to reveal her imprisonment tattoo from her time in the concentration camp. A series of shots show a winter camp before the occupants return to the road. *France—French Romani set up camp with their metal [[Vardo (Romani wagon)|vardos]] in a summer field and briefly go about their business, making baskets and other crafts before being driven off by landlords.

The Lotus Eaters (film)
 The story is told mostly through the eyes of Zoe, the younger Kingswood daughter.  The Kingswoods seem to live a happy life, though teenage Cloe is frustrated with an inability to do things, like travel to Vancouver to see the Beatles.  A catalyst for change for their somewhat stagnant lives arrives in the form of Anne-Marie ([[Michèle-Barbara Pelletier]]), Zoe's new teacher at the school where Hal Kingswood is principal.  Anne-Marie arrives late on her first day of work with all of her belongings packed into her Volkswagen bus and takes up residence in a local cottage.  The new teacher's progressive ideas shake up the little school, much to the irritation of Hal the staid and stodgy principal.  Zoe (and most of her class) are immediately delighted with the lovely and vivacious young Anne-Marie who teaches them through song and art.  One evening, Anne-Marie invites Zoe over to her little cottage.  As Anne-Marie bathes in her wood-fired, outdoor bathtub, she gives Zoe a book of spells, which is ostensibly the mechanism through which change comes to the sleepy little island.  Change is relatively mild at first - Cloe gets her first boyfriend, Dwayne Spittle, and Zoe learns how to make the wind gust.  Real change comes to Galiano Island when Hal discovers (thanks to Zoe) that his long dead father hasn't been dead for decades, as previously presumed, and only recently died (his ashes were shipped to Hal's mother).  Hal's father abandoned Hal and his mother, Flora ([[Frances Hyland]]), when Hal was a child. Hal is rocked by the revelation of his father's abandonment, the fact that his father was alive, and his mother's lies.  The combination of the shock of Hal's father's death and Hal's anger leads Flora to suffer a stroke.  Hal is in a tailspin.  When he chances upon Anne-Marie crying in her bus, he takes a moment to learn more about her,  discovering that she abandoned her fiance at the altar and that her mother calls her every morning to remind her that she is a disappointment.  As Anne-Marie talks of wanting to sail away to Mexico, Hal joins in and the two of them share a kiss, which scares both of them.  As fall sets in, Hal gets closer and closer to Anne-Marie while Cloe gets closer and closer to her new boyfriend, Dwayne.  After Halloween, Zoe and her friend, Jo, see Hal's car parked in front of Anne-Marie's cottage and decide to take a closer peek. They discover the two lovers kissing passionately and quietly sneak away.  Zoe attempts to curse her teacher with limited success.  In the meantime, Cloe and Dwayne break the news to Cloe's parents that Cloe is pregnant and they are not getting married, leaving Hal and Diana reeling.  When Diana Kingswood discovers that Anne-Marie has no plans for Christmas, she immediately insists she have Christmas dinner with them.  It's all too much for Zoe and she bolts from the dinner table.  When Hal follows her up to her room, Zoe confronts him about his affair with Anne-Marie.  Soon, everyone at the table knows.  Diana kicks out Hal and burns his boat to the ground.  Unexpectedly, Hal's mother, Flora, passes away.  Diana and Hal embrace at the funeral.  Anne-Marie is confronted by her students about her affair with Hal and soon resigns.  Anne-Marie leaves town and is replaced by a young male teacher.  
The Long Silence
   
M. Butterfly (film)
 Loosely based on true events (see [[Bernard Boursicot]] and [[Shi Pei Pu]]), the film concerns René Gallimard ([[Jeremy Irons]]), a [[French people|French]] diplomat assigned to [[Beijing]], [[China]] in the 1960s. He becomes infatuated with a [[Chinese opera]] performer, Song Liling ([[John Lone]]), who [[Espionage|spies]] on him for the Government of the People's Republic of China. Their affair lasts for 20 years, with Gallimard all the while apparently unaware (or willfully ignorant) of the fact that in traditional Chinese opera, all roles are performed by men.  
Madadayo
 The main story of the film is based on the life of a Japanese academic and author [[Hyakken Uchida]] (1889–1971). The film opens with him resigning as [[professor]] of [[German language|German]], in the period immediately before the [[Second World War]]. The plot is centered on his relationship with his former students, who care for him in his old age.  The title (''Not Yet'' in [[English language|English]]) is an allusion to an ancient [[History of Japan|Japanese]] [[legend]] mentioned in one scene of an old man who refuses to die. This story is referred to in the movie — every year on the old man's birthday his students throw him a party in which they all ask him, "''Mada kai?''" ("Are you ready?"). He responds by drinking a large ceremonial glass of beer and shouting "''Mada dayo!''" ("Not yet!"), implying that death may be near, but life still goes on. The movie also covers the events that transpire between these birthdays, such as his moving into a new house, his discovery of (and loss of) a beloved house cat, etc.  As the years progress, the annual celebrations shift from a fraternity party atmosphere to a gathering of families. The ceremonial large glass of beer that Uchida drinks changes as well, but he always completes his full glass.  
Mad Dog and Glory
  Wayne Dobie (De Niro) is a [[Shyness|shy]] [[Chicago Police Department]] crime scene photographer who has spent years on the job without ever drawing his gun; his colleagues jokingly call him "Mad Dog". Mad Dog saves the life of mob boss Frank Milo (Murray) during a hold-up in a convenience store. Milo offers Mad Dog a gift in return: for one week, he will have the "personal services" of Glory (Thurman), a young woman who works as a bartender at Milo's club.  Mad Dog learns that Glory is trying to pay off a personal debt and wants nothing to do with Milo after the debt is paid off. After an awkward start, they fall in love. Mad Dog wants her to move into his apartment, but Milo has no intention of letting Glory go. Milo says that Mad Dog has to pay $40,000 to give Glory her freedom, and sends one of his thugs to enforce the threat. Mad Dog's partner, Mike (Caruso), saves Mad Dog from the thug.  Mad Dog does his best to get the money but falls short by $12,500. Knowing that Mike can't protect him, he courageously stands up to Milo himself, and ends up brawling with Milo in the street. Humiliated, Milo makes peace with Mad Dog and lets Glory go with no strings attached.  
The Mad Monk
 The movie starts out with all of the gods in heaven complaining to the [[Jade Emperor]] about the malicious practical jokes played on them by [[Mahakasyapa|Dragon Fighter Lohan]]. The Emperor summons Dragon's sworn-brother, Tiger Fighter Lohan ([[Ng Man Tat]]), in order to find Dragon. Dragon ([[Stephen Chow]]) eventually appears and rebuke the various gods for their horrible judgments on mankind. He insisted he can do a better job and is banished to be reincarnated into an animal by the Jade Emperor. The [[Bodhisattva]] [[Guan Yin]] ([[Anita Mui]]) intervene and issues Dragon a challenge. If he can change the fates of three people—a beggar, a prostitute, and a villain—doomed to nine incarnations as their current position in life within three heavenly days (thirty years), without heavenly powers, he will be upgraded in heavenly status. If he fails, he will be downgraded from an [[arhat]] to an animal. The Bodhisattva gives him a magical fan that can only be used three times a day for [[Sleight of hand|sleight-of-hand]]-like magic tricks to help him in his mission. However, heavenly soldiers force him down from heaven before he has the fan in hand.  When Dragon's future parents visit a Buddhist temple to pray for a child, the statue of [[Mahakasyapa|Dragon Fighter Lohan]] leaps from a wall containing the major arhats, signaling his rebirth on earth. While Dragon grows into manhood (only a few moments in heavenly time), Tiger enlists the aid of a heavenly soldier (Wong Yut Fei) to help him reincarnate on earth so he can bring Dragon the magical fan. However, the heavenly soldier mistakenly causes Tiger to be born to an extremely old woman and the fan to a much younger woman. He then uses his magic breath to cause Tiger to rapidly grows to his proper age but with the brain of a baby. Dragon's earthly parents later adopt the "idiot" and treat him like an infant son. [[File:Madmonk03.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Stephen Chow]] as "Dragon Fighter Lohan" (right) and [[Ng Man Tat]] as "Tiger Fighter Lohan" (left).]] Dragon eventually regains all his memories after being struck by lightning and soon encounters the prostitute ([[Maggie Cheung]]), the beggar ([[Anthony Wong (Hong Kong actor)|Anthony Wong]]) and the villain (Kirk Wong). Tiger gains his memories back when clouds block the moon (the time when heavenly security is the most relaxed) and gives Dragon his magic fan before being forced to return to heaven. Dragon uses his magic to influence the thoughts and behaviors of each of his targets. For instance, he turns himself into the likeness of the beggar's father and tells him to stop begging. However, that doesn't work so he turns himself into a host of other beings to try to convince him. He later uses his magic to save the prostitute from being [[burnt at the stake]]. While trying to boost the begger's self-esteem, the villain attacks Dragon. Dragon transforms himself into [[Shaolin Temple|Shaolin]]'s patriarch, [[Bodhidharma|Damo]], to combat the aggressive attacks of the villain but his power eventually was exhausted for the day. The villain then subsequently murders the beggar and forces Dragon to watch while he brutally rapes the prostitute. The beggar, before dying, regained his dignity and recognised himself by his own name and not as a beggar.   Dragon rushes back to the temple that houses the holy golden-skeleton of his body from a former life to retrieve his skeleton. He uses the skeleton to travel to the underworld to retrieve the beggar's soul. Once there, Dragon confronts a demon who handles all the souls travelling to hell and trades his skeleton for the beggar's soul, but the demon keeps both and kicks Dragon back to the land of the living. Dragon rushes back to the temple once again and learns that all of the local gods and arhats housed there are leaving the temple as they do not want to be associated with Dragon, who has made a deal with a demon. The statue of Guan Yin wept and then subsequently collapse. In a fit of anger, Dragon waves his magic fan to repair it, only to have it disintegrate into a million pieces (thus symbolizing that all the gods and the Bodhisattva has forsaken him in his time of need). Thinking he had failed to change the fate of the beggar before his death, Dragon immediately seeks out the prostitute and promises to marry her if she gives up the [[sex trade]]. She agrees, but when Dragon begins to transform into a tree because of a prohibition against gods marrying mortals, she thinks he is playing a joke on her and disfigures her face with a hair pin so no one would ever love her.  Meanwhile, the villain slaughters all the prostitutes in the [[brothel]] and his [[henchmen]] so he could acquire the blood of 49 people and immerse Dragon's skeleton in it to rid it of its power. Dragon goes to the brothel to confront the villain and, with the help of Tiger and the heavenly soldier, is able to regain his proper form. With the villain held back by Tiger and the heavenly soldier, Dragon beat up the villain, to discover that he has been given an invincible body by the demon that Dragon traded with in the underworld. The villain revealed that he is a devotee of that demon. Dragon then pulled the villain's heart out to show him that the demon gave him a stone heart to control him forever. Feeling betrayed, the villain revealed that the demon has schemed to force all the gods and arhats out of the temple so it can retrieve his [[scepter|scepter of power]], which was hidden under the statue of [[Guan Yin]] by the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. He then repented, crushes the stone heart in his hand and wishes to be an animal in his next life.  Dragon was given a chance to return to heaven but with a three rank demotion if he admitted defeat. However, he decided to remain to prevent the demon from retrieving its scepter and brings destruction to all. Dragon imbues his power into his golden skeleton, pounds it into powder and made into golden paint. He then use it to write protective talismans on the windows of the temple. However the demon blew away the talisman which forces Dragon and the temple monk to run away with the scepter as the demon demolishes the town looking for it. In the process of escaping, the remaining golden paint was swallowed by the monk. The monk subsequently admitted that he had borrowed two of the skeleton's golden teeth to substitute his own. The monk then boasting of his false demon-exorcising powers to the demon in a bid to make the demon laugh and open his mouth. Dragon, with his 2 golden teeth, jumps into the demon's mouth while he was laughing away at the monk. This caused the demon to explode and die while the monk sacrified only Dragon's clothes are left behind.  The gods begin to celebrate in heaven because Dragon seemingly lost the bet and was going to be demoted to an animal. Guan Yin interrupts the festivities and shows them how he succeeded in changing the fates of the three people: The redignified beggar is reborn into the house of a rich family, the redeemed prostitute opens up a [[bean curd]] restaurant and no longer sells her body, and the regretted villain is reborn a pig. Instead of being demoted to become an animal, Dragon was promoted to a senior arhat. Dragon was then presented with a tiara and sceptor in a promotion ceremony and asked to give his thoughts in a parody of a Beauty Pageant.  
Love Bites (film)
  Dwight Putnum ([[Roger Rose]]) has just asked Kendall Gordon ([[Kimberly Foster]]) for the 10th time to marry him, but Kendall is still unwilling to commit. She has this idea that the perfect man for her is still out there. Vampire Zachary Simms ([[Adam Ant]]) has just awakened in his coffin from a 100-year sleep in the crypt under Kendall's house and comes out through the secret door in her fireplace to face the brave, new world. When the two meet, it isn't quite love at first bite, but Zachary spends the next day in her bed anyway. This angers Dwight when he tries to put the make on Zachary, thinking the lump under the covers is Kendall.  It doesn't take long before Kendall and Zachary become friends, and Zachary tells her how he came to be a vampire. He was born in England in 1660 and moved to Boston in 1675. In 1688, he was bitten by a vampire named Nerissa, and they lived together for 100 years before she suddenly decided to run off with a Washington politician. Zachary pined for Nerissa for the next one hundred years and finally decided to sleep it off. Unfortunately, he forgot to wake up until another one hundred years had passed.  Zachary is entranced by such devices as refrigerators, electric light bulbs, and cars that talk. Zachary is also entranced by Kendall, and before long, they are a twosome. Zachary decides to end his existence as a vampire and asks Kendall to help him in 'reviving his digestive system' so that he can eat human food. Before long, Zachary is slurping down spaghetti and munching on pizza. When he finds that he has a blood pressure, can go outside in the daytime, and drinking blood makes him gag, he proclaims himself 'rehumanized.' Everything is going great, until 1) Zachary lands a job with Dwight's insurance firm, 2) Dwight hires Vinnie Helsting ([[Philip Bruns]]) to do a little detective work on Zachary, and 3) Nerissa ([[Michelle Forbes]]) shows up wanting Zachary back.  Zachary starts working the night shift in the data entry department. One night he discovers $1,300,000 that has been moving from department to department in small increments. Dwight rewards him for his find by making him an executive vice president and giving him a company car. Within a short time, Zachary is using his bloodthirsty skills to put the bite on potential clients, proving that he can make a killing in the business. Unfortunately, he's spending less and less time with Kendall and becoming more and more of a yuppie. When Zachary suggests to the board of directors a plan that will increase their profits 30% each year for 100 years, they make him chief executive officer of the company, which effectively puts Dwight out of a job.  While Zachary is rapidly moving up the ladder, Helsting can't find anything on him. No birth certificate, no credit cards, no paper trail, so he begins tailing Zachary wherever he goes, taking photographs, and casing the house Zachary shares with Kendall. One night, when no one is home, Helsting enters the house, notices the secret door in the fireplace, and discovers the crypt and Zachary's coffin. While there, he overhears Zachary's message machine taking a phone call. 'Hello. I can't come to the phone right now. I'm dead.' Then Nerissa comes on, warning Zachary to be careful so that Dwight doesn't find out what Zachary really is. Helsting puts two and two together and figures it out...Zachary is a vampire.  It looks like Zachary is about to be defanged. Dwight wants his business back. Kendall says Zachary was more human when he was a vampire and wants him out of her life. Nerissa says that the only solution is to 'revamp' him, so she gets the process started by biting him on the neck. Dwight takes back his business, setting up Zachary as a consultant with a perpetual income that will make him rich for centuries. Kendall informs Zachary that she is pregnant with his baby and agrees to allow him to 'vampirize' her when the baby is old enough to understand. Nerissa agrees to become the baby's godmother and buy her pretty dresses or take him to Mets night games.

Columbus explains his voyage that will prove his newly discovered theory to Isabella, and she decides to finance Columbus' voyage to prove that the world is round. The King agrees to do this as well, but he tells Columbus that if he does not return with gold, he will be executed. As the three have a feast that night, Pico decides to leave them and snoop around the castle. He climbs a large tower and hops across from the window onto a [[chandelier]], where he meets Marilyn, the fairy princess of a faraway land. All was well with her land until the evil Swarm Lord took her away and keeps her prisoner inside the chandelier until she tells him the secret of her powers, which do not work on the forces of evil. Pico and Marilyn try to escape, but the Swarm Lord returns and takes Marilyn away to his lair in the still-undiscovered new world of [[United States|America]]. As the Swarm Lord flies away, Pico determines to get Marilyn back.  The next day, Columbus is about to set sail on the [[Santa María (ship)|Santa Maria]] to discover the new world. Pico rushes to the ship, but is stopped by a trio of rats, who plan to eat him. Pico manages to escape, but the rats follow him, hopefully to get a free ride to the new world. Pico gets on board Columbus's ship. The two friends reunite, and Pico explains that he needs to save Marilyn. Columbus's shipmates overhear their captain talking to Pico, and come to the conclusion that Columbus is crazy. As the ships continue on their voyage, Pico bumps into the rats again. They want to leave the ship on one of the lifeboats, because they overheard that the ship is heading to the supposed "edge of the earth". Pico needs them to stay, in case if the shipmates want to plan a mutiny on Columbus, and the lifeboat is his only chance. Pico convinces the rats to stay with his lie that there's giant amounts of cheese at the new world.  As day fades into night, Pico overhears that the shipmates really plan to kill Columbus and turn back in order to stay away from the edge of the earth. Pico tells this to Columbus, and Columbus is worried. However, he distracts his crew by singing a song to them about life on the sea and other leaders from other time periods, including [[Odysseus|Ulysses]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and the [[Vikings]]. Though he gets carried away with the final lyrics to the song that insults the crew (''I heard a tale of travelers who feared they would reach the edge / But long before, a serpent came and ate them up instead''), they let Columbus live. The next day, Columbus and the crew think they see land, but it is actually a deserted Viking ship. The crew is angry at Columbus once more and try to hang him. As he hangs, Columbus sees the new world. Just then, the Swarm Lord flies over the ship and tries to kill everyone on the ship. The ship manages to get away, and lands on The New World by crashing into a dam made by a beaver named Bob. While the crew stays behind, Pico, Columbus, Bob, and two of the rats (one of them did not survive the Swarm Lord's wrath) go through the jungles of the island to the Swarm Lord's [[Aztec]] temple.  Meanwhile, the Swarm Lord still wants Marilyn's powers, but Pico and his friends come in and save the day. Columbus climbs up to the top of the Swarm's giant [[honeycomb]] and takes a golden [[Cult image|idol]] while Pico saves Marilyn. Columbus uses the idol to squash the Swarm Lord, and Bob has finished chewing through the honeycomb, which causes it crumble. The temple starts to crumble as well. The team escapes, but Marilyn drowns in a waterfall and is found lifeless on a floating flower. Once the sun rises, she comes back to life and Pico and Marilyn kiss. Afterward, they encounter the island's natives, who thank Columbus for destroying the Swarm Lord. The group sail off back to [[Spain]], and Columbus is happy knowing that he discovered the new world and proved that the world is round.  The film ends with Columbus imaging what America will be like many years later, showing [[New York City|the city of Manhattan]]. The Hemdale English dub's end credits play the song "Heaven Is" by [[Al Jarreau]].

He is an [[Dean (education)|Associate Dean]] at a local college, while his wife teaches art to children. When a student is attacked and seriously wounded by a [[serial rape|serial rapist]], Dr. Jed Hill, a brilliant surgeon who has recently joined the staff of the area hospital, operates and saves her life. Money is tight, so Andy invites him to rent the third floor of their home, in order to finance the new plumbing. With his propensity to bring home sexual partners and to party late into the night, Jed quickly proves himself to be a less-than-ideal tenant.  When Paula Bell, one of Andy's students, is attacked and killed by the serial rapist, Andy is the one to find her body, prompting police detective Dana Harris to view him as a possible suspect. Harris asks Andy to come to the police station and submit a [[semen]] sample in order to clear his name. While at the police station, Andy learns that Tracy has been hospitalized and is being operated on by Jed. In removing one of Tracy's [[ovary|ovaries]], which has ruptured due to a [[cyst]], Jed discovers Tracy is pregnant, but the stress of the procedure causes the [[fetus]] to [[spontaneous abortion|abort]].  Another doctor notices that Tracy's other ovary is [[Ovarian torsion|torsed]] and appears [[necrotic]]. Jed consults with Andy and advises him to agree to the removal of Tracy's second ovary, rather than risk her life. Andy painfully agrees, since this will mean that Tracy can never have children. Jed overrules the protests of other doctors that the ovary might still be healthy and he removes it. After the removal, it is confirmed that the ovary was, in fact, healthy. Tracy tells Jed she's suing him for malpractice.  Jed delivers a deposition in which he launches into a monologue about his own infallibility as a surgeon, concluding with the assertion that he is [[god complex|literally God]]. Fearful of the negative publicity that would result from a civil trial, the hospital and Jed's insurance company [[Settlement (litigation)|settle]] with Andy and Tracy for $20 million. However, Tracy leaves Andy, telling him that she can't forgive him for the loss of her ability to have children.  The serial rapist, a handyman named Earl, is arrested, clearing Andy's name. In the aftermath of the arrest, Dana informs Andy that his semen sample indicated that he was [[male infertility|sterile]], and that he couldn't have fathered Tracy's child. Andy confronts Tracy's lawyer, Dennis Riley, accusing him of having impregnated Tracy; Riley protests his innocence, but tells Andy that Tracy's mother — whom she had told Andy had died 12 years ago — can answer all of his questions. Riley refuses to break [[Attorney–client privilege|lawyer-client privilege]], but tells Andy to take a bottle of [[Scotch whisky|Scotch]] to her.  Andy tracks down Mrs. Kennsinger, who tells Andy that Tracy is a lifelong [[con artist]]. As a younger woman, she had an affair with a wealthy man, who paid for her to have an abortion; Tracy kept the money and had it done at a clinic, beginning her career as a con woman. Andy ultimately learns that Tracy arranged for Jed to move into the house so that he could begin overdosing her with a [[fertility drug]] which causes ovarian cysts when taken in excess amounts, revealing the real reason why Tracy left Andy for Jed. An angry Andy confronts Tracy and tells her he wants half of the settlement money. Suspecting that she might try to murder him, Andy implies their next-door neighbor, the ten-year-old boy who's been their seeming voyeur, is named in his will as a potential police witness to her and Jed's nefarious activities.  Supported by Andy's suggestion, Jed tells Tracy to give Andy what he wants so they can leave the country, but Tracy instead suggests murdering the boy. Jed refuses to kill a child, so Tracy, fed up with Jed's abusive attitude, shoots him to death, ending their partnership. That night, with the money about to be given to Andy, she slips into the neighbor's house and attempts to suffocate the boy, only to see that the figure she had seen sitting by his bedroom window was in fact a CPR dummy. Tracy destroys the dummy and lunges at Andy, claiming that it was a set-up. Detective Harris appears and arrests her, revealing that the boy's supposed agreement to testify against her was part of a [[sting operation]] to catch her in the act of attempted murder.  As Tracy is led away in handcuffs, the real boy and his mother return home; as she is put into the police car, Tracy sees that the boy is, in fact, [[Visual impairment|blind]]. Andy leaves with Dana to have a drink of Scotch.

Man's Best Friend (1993 film)
   Judy Sanders (Robin Frates), an employee of a genetic research facility named EMAX, contacts television personality Lori Tanner ([[Ally Sheedy]]), planning to meet after work so she can show Lori the atrocities and [[cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]] that go on in EMAX's laboratories. As she proceeds back to work, an animal assailant attacks and kills her. Dr. Jarret ([[Lance Henriksen]]), a scientist performing [[vivisection]] and [[Genetic engineering|genetic altering]] and the owner of EMAX, comes in and shoots the animal with a sedative to stop the attack. Later, Lori arrives at EMAX. When Judy does not appear, she breaks into the laboratory and films the various animals that are being [[experiment]]ed on. She discovers a [[Tibetan Mastiff]] named Max who does not appear to have been experimented on and lets the dog out of his cage. Dr. Jarret discovers that there is an intruder in the laboratory and chases Lori out of the building, with Max following Lori into her car as she drives away. Jarret immediately goes to the police and complains that his dog has been stolen. Later that day, when Lori goes shopping, a mugger ([[Thomas Rosales, Jr.]]) steals her purse. Max chases the thief, brutally kills him, and brings Lori's purse back to her.  Unaware that the dog has killed the mugger, Lori develops a bond with Max, feeling protected with him around and decides to keep him. However, her boyfriend Perry ([[Fredric Lehne]]) initially refuses to allow Lori to keep the dog, despite his heroic actions. He finally agrees to let Max stay, but only if he stays in the backyard. However, Max can understand human conversations and becomes overprotective of Lori. He later finds Lori and Perry having sex in their bedroom and tries to attack Perry, understanding that Perry isn't too fond of him.  Dr. Jarret is questioned by detectives Frankie Kovacs ([[Robert Costanzo]]) and Emilio Bendetti ([[John Cassini]]) about Max. Jarret reveals that Max is a genetically altered dog, spliced with the [[DNA]] of various other [[animal]]s such as [[big cat]]s, [[snake]]s, [[chameleon]]s, and [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] giving him enhanced strength, speed, and senses. Max is also prone to violent rages, and Jarrett regularly gives him a drug to keep him relaxed, but he fears that it won't be long before the effects of the drug wear off.  Max acts as a loyal, obedient, and lovable dog to Lori, but when her back is turned he starts wreaking havoc in the neighborhood, terrorizing some local children (though he seems all right with Lori's young neighbor Rudy), devouring a [[cat]], destroying the brake lines in Perry's truck, mating with a neighbor's collie Heidi, and murdering a [[Mail carrier|mail man]] (Rick Barker). All of these incidents go unnoticed by Lori. Realizing Max gnawed through the brake lines of his truck in an attempt to kill him, Perry tries to kill Max by feeding him [[poison]]ed [[hamburger]]. He tries to convince Max to eat it but Max smells the [[poison]] in the [[meat]] and chases Perry out of the house. After Perry escapes in his truck, Max eats Lori's talking pet [[parrot]], who  begins berating him. Max proceeds to dump the [[poison]] ridden [[hamburger]] in the toilet and flushes it.  Noticing Perry's animosity towards their new dog, Lori decides to find Max a new home. She takes him to a [[Wrecking yard|junkyard]] and leaves him with the owner Ray ([[William Sanderson]]), who assures her that Max will be taken to a ranch in a few days. However, when Lori leaves, Ray [[chain]]s Max to the wall and hits him over the head with a [[shovel]], knocking him out. When Max wakes up, he pulls loose from his chain and attacks Ray. Unfortunately, Ray arms himself with a [[blow torch]] and burns Max's face, but right as he is about to get his gun, he is soon overpowered and killed. Max, now severely scarred, leaves the junkyard and makes his way back to Lori's house. The police, after discovering the dead mugger and having Dr. Jarret clarify that it was Max who killed him, now intend to stop Max at any cost. By the time Max returns to Lori's, Perry has replaced him with a new puppy named Spike. Max, feeling betrayed, confronts Perry and burns his face with acidic urine, much to Lori's horror and realization. Max attempts to attack Lori and the neighbor kid but the police arrive to apprehend Max. Max then escapes out of the house and evades the cops and an animal control unit by utilizing his genetic gifts.  As an ambulance takes Perry away, the police demand Lori's help to catch Max and wait for him. Max arrives and kills the police watching the house, which Lori soon discovers. In an attempt to get him back, Jarret kidnaps Lori and her new dog Spike in hopes that Max will follow, which he does. Jarret drives back to the EMAX building, telling Lori that Max will turn on her as he did to Jarret. Max then chases them and attacks, jumping onto the car and causing it to crash. Lori pulls herself free from the car and grabs Spike as well. Upon realizing that Max is still alive, she runs into the building with Max chasing her into the laboratory where she first discovered him. She grabs a knife to protect herself as Max stalks her through the laboratory. In a final face to face confrontation, Lori realizes she isn't scared of Max, knowing he wouldn't hurt her and feels the bond they shared. Max watches as Lori puts down the [[knife]] and reaches out for him. Max relinquishes his aggressive, homicidal nature and begins to kiss her hand. Dr. Jarret, still alive, arrives with a [[pump-action]] [[shotgun]] and demands Lori move away from Max or he will kill them both. Lori refuses to move out of the way and Max breaks out of her grasp to protect her by taking the shot to the chest and pushing Dr. Jarret onto a large electrical cage. Spike begins to play and bite the electrical outlet connected to the cage, sparking it which begins electrocuting Jarret and killing him instantly. Lori rests Max's head on her lap and pets him as he dies and proceeds to mourn for him.  Three months later, Lori is going for a walk with Spike, and runs into Rudy. Rudy tells Lori that his dog has just had puppies and invites her to see them. Most of the puppies look like their mother with the one exception being a small black puppy that resembles Max, implying that this puppy has inherited Max's genetic altering... or at least his father's attitude.

They also trick Helen into a fake audition where her voice is recorded, edited, and later used to harass Paul, by demanding he give Larry and Carol $200,000 or kill them if he wanted everything covered up. They knew he'd go for the latter, and hoped the police would catch him in the act.  The plan backfires as Paul kidnaps Carol and calls Larry, demanding Lillian's body, in exchange for Carol. Paul and Larry meet in the theater and get into a scuffle. Larry breaks free and searches for Carol, with Paul in pursuit. An array of mirrors and glass behind the theater reflect the movie being screened ([[Orson Welles]]' ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'') and mislead Paul several times. Suddenly, Paul's loyal assistant Mrs. Dalton, an older paramour earlier brushed aside by Paul in favor of Helen, shoots him in an exchange of gunfire. Larry rescues Carol and they call the police.  After the cops arrive, Marcia explains that the dead body in the apartment was actually Lillian's rich sister, who bore a passing resemblance to Lillian but was not her twin. The sister had suffered a heart attack while visiting them, and the Houses decided to take advantage of the situation by claiming that it was Lillian who had died. Lillian would then assume the identity of her sister (a recluse living at the hotel) in order to manipulate her sister's will, naming Lillian and Paul as sole beneficiaries. But Paul then double-crossed and killed Lillian, so he could run off with Helen.

When Simon is about to throw a dumpster at Jeff, he hears Ellington barking, telling Jeff that he can win, and throws the dumpster at Ellington instead, fatally injuring him. This angers Jeff and he disappears and returns as Meteor Man. They continue with their brawl with Meteor Man winning and draining Simon of his powers by absorbing them. He then defeats the rest of the Golden Lords. The locals all gather around Ellington who is now lying on the street, whimpering in pain. Jeff uses his x-ray vision to see that Ellington's ribs are broken. Before Jeff can do anything, his powers fade away, again. But just then, Marvin comes over and uses the last of his powers from the meteor fragment to heal Ellington's injuries, thus saving Ellington's life. The locals all applaud.  Anthony Byers and his gang then confront Meteor Man, but are outnumbered by the Bloods and the Crips who show up to protect Meteor Man. Anthony Byers and his gang are then arrested by the police after attempting to "take a vacation to the [[Bahamas]]".

The vital information for this project is stored on a [[integrated circuit|microchip]]. But it is neither the inventor nor the chip Sean has to guard - he is to look after the two Mason kids: Alex Jr. ([[Robert Hy Gorman]]) and Kate ([[Madeline Zima]]).  As it turns out, Alex and Kate are two highly mischievous brats who vie for their often-too-absent father's attention by wreaking havoc in the household via elaborate and rather vicious pranks and booby-traps, with their specialty targets being the nannies he has assigned to take care of them (Alex Sr. is a widower). Sean witnesses the last nanny jumping into the fountain in front of the house to extinguish the fire in her hair. However, their father proves to be either too distracted or too lenient, which causes the children to continue their schemes. Thinking that he is a new (albeit unusual) replacement, they find a new target in Sean. But after one prank too many, which involves a swimming pool full of red dye ("the Pit of Blood"), Sean finally exerts his authority and not only gets to quiet Alex and Kate down, he also manages to open the eyes of their father to his family problems, as well as bonding with the kids and managing to help them sort out problems of their own.  However, the real trouble has just started. The unscrupulous and vain Tommy Thanatos ([[David Johansen]]) is after Alex Sr.'s chip, and he will not stop at anything to get it. As it turns out, Sean and Burt had been once at the receiving end of one of his schemes: he had ordered them to throw a match, and when they had not complied, he attempted to shoot them. However, Burt threw himself in front of Sean, taking the bullet in his right leg (thus his bum leg); Sean had chased Thanatos to the roof of the stadium, and after a furious fight Thanatos ended up plunging head-first into an empty pool. This accident fractured the top of his skull, forcing the attachment of a steel skullplate and removing part of his [[afro]] of which he was so proud.  Thanatos kidnaps Alex Sr. with the help of Frank Olsen ([[Raymond O'Connor]]), the corrupt security chief of Mason Systems (who is disposed of en route to the hideout), and demands of him to hand over the chip. When Alex Sr. (who stowed the chip in Kate's doll) refuses, Thanatos has Alex and Kate kidnapped in order to force him to comply. Despite a valiant effort, Sean is overpowered and Burt is taken as well, giving Thanatos an unexpected revenge bonus. But Sean manages to track down Thanatos, and with the help of his friends is able to beat the villains. As Thanatos prepares to charge Sean, Alex Sr. and the children activate an improvised electromagnet to launch him into the night sky, leaving only his skullplate.  The movie ends with Sean preparing to take a leave of absence from the Masons. But Alex and Kate intend to have him back much sooner - and therefore Sean falls victim to yet another prank.

Mrs. Doubtfire
  Daniel Hillard is a freelance voice actor in San Francisco. Although he is a devoted father to his three children Lydia, Chris, and Natalie, his wife Miranda considers him unreliable. One day, Daniel quits his job and returns home to throw a lavish birthday party for Chris despite Miranda's objections, creating a situation with their neighbors. Miranda files for divorce, and the judge gives sole custody of the children to her, but tells Daniel if he can find a steady job and a suitable residence within three months, she will agree to share joint custody.  Daniel works to rebuild his life, getting a menial job at a local television station, and learns that Miranda is seeking a housekeeper to watch over the children. He secretly alters her classified ad form to keep other interested people away, and then uses his voice acting skills to call Miranda about the job, making them all undesirable applicants. He then calls Miranda as a Scottish-accented nanny, whom he calls Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire, with strong credentials. Miranda is impressed and invites her for an interview. Daniel gets help from his brother Frank, a makeup artist, and Frank's partner Jack, to create a Mrs. Doubtfire persona, including a prosthetic mask to make him appear as an older woman.  Miranda hires Mrs. Doubtfire after the impressive interview. Upon returning to the apartment, Mrs Doubtfire is met by Mrs. Sellner, Daniel's court liaison, hoping to see Daniel and carry out her inspection of the apartment. This results in Daniel changing back and forth from Mrs. Doubtfire and himself to meet Mrs. Sellner's needs, which ultimately leads at one point to Daniel's mask flying out the window, where it is flattened by a rubbish truck. He cleverly conceals his face by donning a "facial mask" from cake frosting in his fridge. Frank and Jack quickly make him a new and slightly older mask.  The children initially struggle with Mrs. Doubtfire's ways, but soon come around and thrive, and further, Miranda learns to become closer with her children. Daniel, as Mrs. Doubtfire, learns several household skills as part of the role, further improving himself. However, this has created another barrier for Daniel to see his children, as Miranda has put more trust into Mrs. Doubtfire than him, and she could never dismiss her. One day, Lydia and Chris discover Daniel's ploy, and while thrilled to have their father back, agree to keep his secret.  While working at the station, Daniel is seen by the station's CEO Jonathan Lundy playing with toy dinosaurs on the set of a cancelled children's show. Impressed by his voice acting and imagination, Lundy asks Daniel to join him for a dinner at Bridge's Restaurant to discuss giving him his own children's show to host. Daniel discovers this is to be on the same night and time as a planned birthday dinner for Miranda by her new boyfriend Stu Dunmire at the same restaurant, to which Mrs. Doubtfire has also been invited. Unable to change either appointment, Daniel decides to try to rotate in and out of the Mrs. Doubtfire outfit to attend both events.  As the dinners progress, a drunken Daniel starts making mistakes after changing in and out of costume, from which he quickly recovers. Stu starts choking on his dinner, and Daniel, as Mrs. Doubtfire, gives him the [[Heimlich maneuver]]. The action causes the prosthetic mask to peel half off his face, revealing his identity, and horrifying Miranda.  At their next custody hearing, Daniel explains about how he met the judge's requirements as well as his actions. However, the judge deems his life unorthodox and potentially harmful to his children, awarding Miranda full cust, with Daniel having limited &ndash; supervised &ndash; Saturday visitation. Without Mrs. Doubtfire, Miranda and her children become miserable, recognizing how much Mrs. Doubtfire improved their lives. They are surprised when the local station starts a new children's show ''Euphegenia's House'' which Daniel, as Mrs. Doubtfire, hosts. The show becomes a hit and starts airing across the country.  Miranda visits Daniel on set, admitting  they were happier when he was involved, and agrees to change the custody rights. Soon after, Miranda is able to hire Daniel as the children's new babysitter, allowing him to see them every day after school—essentially what he was able to do as Mrs. Doubtfire. As Daniel takes the kids out, Miranda watches an episode of ''Euphegenia's House'' where Mrs. Doubtfire answers a letter from a young girl whose parents have separated, saying no matter what arrangements families have, love will prevail.

Also present are Benedick's friend Claudio, a young count; and Don John who, despite his rebellion, has apparently reconciled with his brother. Claudio has been thinking of Leonato's beautiful daughter Hero since before he went to war, and returns to find her as attractive as ever. Don Pedro, learning of his friend's feelings, decides to act on his behalf and arranges the match at a party. An unrepentant Don John attempts to foil it, but unsuccessfully – the match is made. Needing something to pass the time until the wedding, Don Pedro decides to arrange a similar fate for Beatrice and Benedick, whose animosity for each other is clear.  Don Pedro, Leonato, and Claudio stage a conversation containing a false account of how much Beatrice loves Benedick, all the while knowing Benedick to be hiding within earshot. Hero and her [[gentlewoman]] Ursula play the same trick upon Beatrice. Each of them believes the story they hear about the other. In the midst of all of this good-natured scheming, Don John has been searching for ways to stop the marriage between Claudio and Hero. The night before the wedding, Don John's servant Borachio arranges a steamy liaison with Hero's gentlewoman Margaret at Hero's chamber window. Don John shows Don Pedro and Claudio this, and they believe that they are seeing Hero in the act of infidelity.  Against the revelry of the evening, the noble but incompetent constable [[Dogberry]] appoints a watch to keep the peace. The three hapless watchmen happen to hear Borachio bragging to his colleague Conrade about how he and Don John had succeeded in stopping the wedding. The watchmen apprehend Borachio and Conrade, and, in the morning, Dogberry attempts to have Leonato interrogate the prisoners. However, a hurried Leonato is unable to decipher what the bumbling Dogberry is trying to tell him. Amidst the confusion, Don John quietly flees.  At the wedding, Claudio publicly disgraces his would-be bride and storms away, along with most of the guests, except for Ursula, the Friar, Leonato, Beatrice, Antonio, and Benedick. They all agree to the Friar's plan to publish the tale that Hero, upon the grief of Claudio's accusations, suddenly died. Beatrice and Benedick linger a moment and eventually confess their love to one another. In the wake of this declaration, Beatrice asks Benedick to do the one thing that will satisfy her outrage with what has just happened – kill Claudio. With a heavy heart, he agrees to challenge his friend. Meanwhile, Borachio and Conrade are interrogated by Dogberry and his men. Despite Dogberry's incompetence, the truth of Don John's sinister machinations is revealed.  Moments after Benedick's challenge to Claudio, Leonato is made aware of what really happened. Leonato continues to pretend to Claudio that Hero is dead. Claudio entreats Leonato to impose whatever vengeance he sees fit for Claudio's part in Hero's disgrace and death. Leonato forgives Claudio on the condition that he publicly declare his wrongdoing and then marry Hero's cousin the next morning. Claudio agrees, and carries out the former by reciting an epitaph at Hero's tomb that night.  When the bride is brought forth the next day, she is revealed to be none other than Hero herself. She and Claudio profess their true, undying love for each other, as do Beatrice and Benedick, who agree to marry. Benedick renounces his challenge against Claudio and embraces him. Moments later, Don John is marched in, having been captured before he could escape. Those gathered begin to dance, with the two happy couples at the middle. Don Pedro remains behind, still single, but happy for his friends.

Needful Things (film)
  A mysterious proprietor named Leland Gaunt ([[Max von Sydow]]), claiming to be from [[Akron, Ohio]], arrives in the small town of [[Castle Rock (Stephen King)|Castle Rock]], [[Maine]] in a sinister-looking [[Mercedes-Benz W189|black car]] and opens a new antique store called "Needful Things".<ref name="Tribune"></ref> The store sells various items of great personal worth to the residents (some of which, like a pendant that eases pain or a toy which predicts the outcome of [[Horse racing|horse races]], are clearly [[supernatural]]). Gaunt demands payment both in cash and in small "favors", usually pranks played by his customers on their neighbors. Gaunt's first customer is a boy named Brian Rusk ([[Shane Meier]]) who buys a rare [[baseball card]] featuring [[Mickey Mantle]] in exchange for 95 cents and a prank on his neighbour Wilma Wadlowski Jerzyck ([[Valri Bromfield]]).<ref name="intheframe"></ref>  Gaunt makes an impression on the town's people, who he also has pull some pranks. One of whom is a corrupt boat salesman and gambler named Danforth Keeton ([[J. T. Walsh]]) who embezzled $20,000 of the town people's tax money to pay off his gambling debts. Keeton finds out from Sheriff Alan Pangborn ([[Ed Harris]]) that people are on to him and in turn he relays his fears to Gaunt and his hatred of those who refer to him as 'Buster' Keeton. To help Keeton with his problems, Gaunt sells him a toy race-horse that predicts the outcome of any horse-race from which he might re-coup the $20,000 and replace the money before the towns-folk find out officially.  Gaunt sells Frank Jewett ([[Campbell Lane]]) a [[Edition (book)#first edition|first edition]] of ''[[Treasure Island]]'' by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. He also learns of the rivalry between the Catholic priest, Father Meehan ([[W. Morgan Sheppard]]) and Baptist minister, Reverend Willie Rose ([[Don S. Davis]]) when he sells each of them objects from his shop.  The first hint of Gaunt's true nature is when he has Brian throw muck from the turkey farm onto the newly laundered crisp white sheets hanging on the washing-lines at the house of Wilma Jerzyck. On returning home, Wilma assumes the devastation was caused by her long-time enemy Nettie Cobb ([[Amanda Plummer]]). She goes and loudly accuses her of this at Nettie's workplace, the Castle Rock diner.  Brian Rusk meets Gaunt at the Lighthouse where he informs Brian he has not fully repaid his debt and expects payment in full right away. Brian returns to Wilma Jerzyck's house and throws apples at her house to smash all the windows.  Nettie Cobb has 'bought' a small statue from Gaunt that is identical to one her violent ex-husband had smashed in a fit of rage. In return she goes to Dan Keeton's house and places [[Post-it note]]s, allegedly from Deputy Sheriff Norris Ridgewick all around the interior, accusing him of all his misdemeanors.  In the meantime, Gaunt has Hugh Priest kill Nettie's dog, in return for a 1950s jacket like he wore at college. This sparks a violent fight between Nettie and Wilma, which gets them both killed.  Gaunt takes a personal measure towards Sheriff Pangborn by giving a necklace to his fiancée Polly Chalmers ([[Bonnie Bedelia]]) that cures her crippling arthritis. Gaunt tells Polly for it to work she must never take it off.  Keeton is found by Gaunt cowering in his shop with a gun. He tells Gaunt that he is thinking of killing Norris Ridgewick to stop him telling everyone about his misdemeanors. Gaunt talks him out of it and takes the gun off him.  Brian witnesses the investigation at Wilma Jercyzk's house and hears the Sheriff musing over where all the apples came from. Brian is shocked that his actions might in some way have caused this tragedy and tries to talk to Sheriff Pangborn about what Gaunt had him do, but is too scared to do so.  At this point it becomes apparent that Gaunt is enjoying what is happening to the townsfolk and is not human, but a demon.  Sheriff Pangborn later approaches Brian when he's alone at the lighthouse and asks what's got him so scared. Brian explains that Gaunt is a monster, before trying to shoot himself in the head. The gun goes off but Pangborn manages to save him and Brian is hospitalized. Meanwhile, Pangborn begins to suspect that Gaunt may not be what he seems.  Father Meehan slashes the tires on Hugh Priest's truck. Hugh Priest sees what has happened to his truck when he is thrown out of the bar for being too drunk. Sheriff Pangborn returns from meeting with Brian and is now very suspicious of Gaunt. He tries to warn Polly and asks her to get rid of the necklace, but she is unwilling to remove it. After Pangborn has gone she tries prying the necklace open to see what is inside and gets an electric shock which throws the necklace across the room. Polly is immediately crippled by her arthritis and cannot reach to pick up the necklace. Gaunt appears in her bedroom and replaces the necklace on Polly's neck. He states the price for necklace will be $20 and a small prank. Polly is so grateful, she pays him immediately and is clearly mesmerized by Gaunt who then seduces her. After which he states that Pangborn is corrupt and has been embezzling money from the town with Keeton for years. He convinces her to go to Pangborn's yacht to look for the money. She does and sees lots of money strewn over Pangborn's desk. She phones Pangborn from the yacht, accuses him of the crime, and in disgust calls off the engagement.  Keeton becomes afraid that everyone including his wife Myrtle Keeton ([[Gillian Barber]]) is out to get him, and Gaunt convinces him that he is his only ally. Gaunt also has Keeton attack deputy Norris Ridgewick at the police station. Pangborn manages to subdue Keeton by handcuffing Keeton to his car. Shortly after this, Keeton manages to escape Ridgewick by kicking him in the groin. He then drives home where he accuses his wife of having an affair with Norris and kills her with a hammer. The phone rings and it is Gaunt. He tells Keeton to come to see him, as he has something for him that will make him feel better.  Hugh Priest goes into the bar with a shotgun and straight up to the owner, who also pulls out a shotgun from behind the bar and they shoot each other.  Gaunt's pranks spread throughout the town and its citizens. Mistaken suspicion, paranoia and anger spread with it. Gaunt starts selling his customers guns, encouraging them to kill whoever wronged them, playing on their greed and fear. Gaunt has Keeton place explosives in the town's Catholic church, where Sheriff Pangborn is inside talking to Father Meehan relaying his new suspicions that Gaunt is the Devil incarnate, but Meehan refuses to believe him. The church explodes, but Pangborn and Meehan manage to escape with their lives. Father Meehan believes that Reverend Willy Rose is behind the attack on the Church and leaves to fight him.  A riot sparks throughout the town, with Gaunt watching from the sidelines. Sheriff Pangborn tries desperately to restore order. He pulls a gun on Father Meehan who is trying to behead Reverend Rose and Gaunt encourages him to shoot them. Pangborn fires into the air, much to Gaunt's disappointment. Getting everyone's attention, Pangborn convinces the townsfolk of Castle Rock to come to their senses, exposing Gaunt's true nature and his web of lies and manipulation.  Everyone stops fighting and admits their pranks, but Keeton, despondant after everything, walks up to Pangborn and Ridgewick, pointing a gun at them with a bomb strapped to himself, threatening to blow everyone up. He is talked down by Pangborn and turns him against Gaunt. Keeton walks up to Gaunt, who taunts him about his inadequacies and is heard to repeatedly refer to him as 'Buster'. Infuriated by this, Keeton tackles Gaunt through the store window, setting off the bomb and destroying Needful Things.  Defeated but completely unharmed, Gaunt emerges from the burning wreckage of his store saying that this wasn't his best work. Gaunt walks up to Pangborn and Polly, telling them they make a cute couple, and he will encounter their grandson in 2053—then departs, presumably to continue his vicious evil work elsewhere, leaving in the same black car in which he arrived.

The Nightmare Before Christmas
 [[Halloween]] Town is a [[fantasy world]] filled with citizens such as [[deformity|deformed]] [[monster]]s, [[ghost]]s, [[ghoul]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[zombie]]s, [[demons]], [[mummy|mummies]], [[vampire]]s, [[werewolf|werewolves]], and [[witchcraft|witches]]. [[Jack Skellington]], the "Pumpkin King" and leader of the town, leads them in organizing the annual Halloween celebrations. However, privately Jack has grown weary of the same routine year after year, and wants something new. Wandering in the woods the morning after Halloween, he stumbles across seven trees containing doors leading to towns representing various holidays, and opens a portal to [[Christmas]] Town. Awed by the unfamiliar holiday, Jack returns to Halloween Town to show the residents his findings, but they fail to grasp the idea of Christmas and compare everything to their ideas of Halloween. Jack sequesters himself in his tower to study Christmas and find a way to rationally explain it, but cannot. He ultimately decides that it's unfair for Christmas Town alone to enjoy the holiday and announces that he and the citizens of Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year.  Jack assigns the citizens of Halloween Town Christmas-themed jobs, including singing carols, making presents, and building a sleigh to be pulled by skeletal [[reindeer]]. Sally, a beautiful rag doll woman that is secretly in love with Jack, feels that their efforts will end in disaster, but Jack dismisses her and assigns her the task of sewing him a red coat to wear. He also tasks Lock, Shock and Barrel, a trio of mischievous [[trick-or-treating]] children, to abduct [[Santa Claus]] and bring him back to Halloween Town. Jack tells Santa he will be bringing Christmas to the world in his place this year. Jack orders the trio to keep Santa safe, but the children instead deliver Santa to Oogie Boogie, a gambling-addict [[bogeyman]], who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake. Sally attempts to rescue Santa so he can stop Jack, but Oogie captures her as well.  Jack departs to deliver presents to the world, but the Halloween-styled gifts terrify and attack the populace. As concerns over "Santa's" behavior grows, the military takes action and shoot down Jack, causing him to crash in the cemetery. As Jack bemoans the disaster he has made of Christmas, he finds he enjoyed the experience nonetheless, reigniting his love of Halloween. Jack returns to Halloween Town and finds Oogie's lair. Oogie tries to kill Jack, but Jack pulls apart the thread holding his cloth form together, revealing a massive pile of bugs that fall into Oogie's cauldron and are killed. Jack apologizes to Santa for his actions, and Santa assures Jack that he can fix things and returns to Christmas Town. As Santa replaces the Halloween-style presents with genuine ones, the townspeople of Halloween Town celebrate Jack's return. Santa then visits Halloween Town and brings them a snowfall for the residents to play with. In the graveyard, Jack and Sally declare their love for each other.  
Ninja Scroll
  In [[Edo period]]-[[Japan]], the Yamashiro clan mines gold in secret, and sends a shipment to the [[House of Toyotomi|Toyotomi]] Shogun of the Dark as payment for his protection. The Shogun of the Dark intends to use the gold to buy advanced Spanish weaponry and overthrow the current government, the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]]. The ship runs aground onto Mochizuki territory in a storm, and the Eight Devils of Kimon, a ninja team with supernatural powers in the employ of the Yamashiro, kill the people of the nearby village of Shimoda to keep the gold shipment a secret.  While investigating the deaths, a Mochizuki [[Kōga-ryū|Koga]] ninja team is massacred by the Devils. The sole survivor, Kagero, is captured by a Devil, Tessai, who molests her. She is rescued by Jubei Kibagami, a [[mercenary]] ex-Yamashiro ninja, who fights and eventually kills Tessai. Dakuan, a Tokugawa spy, [[blackmail]]s Jubei into helping him kill the remaining Devils. To ensure his compliance, Dakuan stabs Jubei with a poisoned [[shuriken]], and promises to give him an antidote once the mission is complete. Jubei learns from Dakuan that the leader of the Devils is Himuro Gemma, the former Yamashiro ninja leader, who had ordered his team’s members to kill each other to cover up the location of the goldmine five years earlier. Jubei, who had been forced to kill his comrades to survive, decapitated Gemma in revenge; Gemma survived due to his [[immortality]]. Jubei is attacked by another Devil, Benisato, but he is saved by Kagero; before she can be questioned, Benisato is killed from afar by Yumimaru, Gemma's right-hand man, for failing her mission. Kagero agrees to work alongside Jubei and Dakuan, who informs Jubei that her body is infused with such deadly toxins that anyone who kisses or sleeps with her dies, which was why Jubei could kill Tessai.  The trio arrive in Shimoda, where they discover that the villagers died due to their water supply being poisoned, making it appear that they were killed by a plague. Jubei and Kagero fend off attacks from three of the Devils – Mushizo, Zakuro and Utsutsu Mujuro; Jubei succeeds in killing Mushizo and Utsutsu. After finding the beached ship, Kagero deduces that the gold has been taken to Kashima Harbour, where it will be transported to the Shogun of the Dark in another ship.   Jubei, Kagero and Dakuan arrive at Kashima, which has been evacuated due to the townspeople’s fear of the plague. While Jubei battles another Devil, Shijima, Kagero sends a message to Sakaki Hyobu, the Mochizuki chamberlain, to bring his army to the harbour. She also learns from Dakuan that Jubei’s poisoning will only be cured if he copulates with her – the poisons in her body will counteract his. Kagero is captured by Shijima, and Jubei kills him, rescuing her once more. Kagero asks Jubei to sleep with her to cure himself. He decides against it, and upon the arrival of the Shogun of the Dark's envoy in a ship, he leaves to prevent the gold reaching its destination.  Kagero arrives to meet Sakaki, but he stabs her, revealing himself to be Gemma in disguise. Enraged, Jubei fights through waves of ninjas, but is nearly killed by Yumimaru. A gunpowder-rigged rat, left as a trap by Zakuro for Yumimaru for rejecting her advances, kills him, allowing Jubei to escape. He finds Kagero; mortally wounded, she admits her love for him and they kiss, curing Jubei’s poisoning. Before dying, Kagero gives Jubei her headband.  Jubei and Dakuan board the departing ship. On board, Gemma reveals his true intentions to the Shogun of the Dark’s envoy (who he kills) – he intends to use the gold to raise a ninja army to terrorize Japan, rather than serve as an ally to the Toyotomi. During an altercation with Zakuro, Jubei and Dakuan set the ship ablaze. As Jubei and Gemma engage in a brutal fight, the gold becomes molten and engulfs Gemma, who sinks to the bottom of the sea. Afterwards, Dakuan thanks Jubei, and expresses admiration for his and Kagero’s humanity. Jubei resumes his vagabond lifestyle, with Kagero’s headband tied around his sword’s hilt.

One day, the Furlings go on a trip through the forest with Cornelius, where they see a road for the first time. Russell is almost run over by a careless driver, who throws away a glass bottle that shatters in the middle of the road. Afterward, they go back to the forest to find that it has been destroyed by [[poison gas]] from an overturned [[tanker truck]] that blew a tire from the broken glass bottle. Michelle panics and runs to her home to find her parents, breathing in the gas and becoming severely ill. Abigail risks her own life and saves a [[Coma|comatose]] Michelle, but can do nothing for Michelle's parents. The Furlings go to Cornelius' house nearby for shelter after they find their homes deserted, believing everyone else to have succumbed to the gas. Cornelius tells the Furlings of his past encounter with humans that claimed the lives of his parents, hence why he is fearful of all human beings. He says he needs two herbs to save Michelle's life: [[pulmonaria|lungwort]] and [[euphrasia|eyebright]]. With limited time, the Furlings head off for their journey the next day.  After encountering numerous dangers, including a hungry [[barn owl]], a flock of religious [[wren]]s led by preacher Phineas, and intimidating [[construction equipment]] that the wrens call "yellow dragons", the Furlings make it to the meadow with the herbs they need. There, they meet the bully squirrel Waggs, and Willy, a tough but sensible mouse who grows a liking for Abigail. After getting the eyebright, they discover that the lungwort is on a giant cliff making it inaccessible by foot. Russell suggests they use Cornelius' airship, the Flapper-Wing-a-Ma-Thing, to get to the lungwort.  The Furlings manage to get the lungwort after a dangerous flight up the cliff, then steer their airship back for Dapplewood. They crash-land back in the forest after a storm, and bring the herbs to Michelle and Cornelius. A group of humans appear and the animals, thinking the humans mean them harm, escape through the backdoor of Cornelius' house. Edgar gets separated from the group and gets caught in an old trap. When one of the workers finds him, the animals are surprised when he frees Edgar and destroys the trap, revealing that the men are cleaning up the gas. The group, especially Cornelius, realize that there are good humans in the world.  Michelle is given the herbs. The next day, she appears unresponsive, but a single tear from Cornelius awakens her from her coma. Cornelius sees the Flapper-Wing-a-Ma-Thing and becomes amazed by how the Furlings have grown up. The Furlings' families and many of the other inhabitants arrive as well, except for Michelle's parents; Cornelius promises to do his best on taking care of her. The Furlings happily reunite with their families, who are relieved to see that their children are alright. Michelle asks Cornelius if anything will ever be the same again. Cornelius looks at the dead trees in the forest and says to her that if everyone works as hard to save Dapplewood as the Furlings did to save Michelle, it will be.

Lost in the Wild
 A couple of student nurses decide to join some doctors to work in a medical station in the rain-forest a few hours flying-time from the Mexican town Catemaco. As they fly from Catemaco towards the clinic (which actually consists of just a few huts and almost no equipment) one of their three planes goes down because of engine malfunction. It crashes somewhere in the middle of the jungle causing bad injuries to the passengers. The following day describes the attempts by the passengers to save their own lives in spite of the few poor chances they seem to have. There is almost no medicine available, the supplies they brought with them were all on the plane going down and were stolen by native drug-dealers when they arrived at the site of the crash first. In the afternoon they decide to take the injured to a nearby village with a runway long enough that the Learjet of the Californian Air Rescue team could take them to a clinic in the U.S. Not only is the journey there very complicated (one of the injured could pass away any minute) but it may also be futile: due to recent anti-drug operations no plane is allowed to fly after dark, so the Air Rescue Team is not able to get clearance for their mission. Dr. Daniel Perrin sets off to Catamaco to persuade the authorities into giving their permission for the flight while the rest is trying to get to the runway by dawn.  
Oh Shucks! Here Comes UNTAG
  Kwagga Robertse owns a farm shop in the fictional Southern African country of Nambabwe and usually cons foreign tourists by pretending to kill a lion, thus earning him the nickname 'Urumbo' (''Lion Killer'') from the country's natives. Kwagga is upset when the [[United Nations|UN]] sends a platoon of incompetent soldiers with the [[United Nations Transition Assistance Group]] (U.N.T.A.G.), to monitor the peace process, and ensure free and fair elections after the [[Namibian War of Independence|Nambabwean War for Independence]]. The U.N.T.A.G's American leader, Major Bradick D. Mackay and his second-in-command, Captain ''Zapman'' are offered a diamond worth a lot of money in the U.S., and they must pay 200,000 USD to Duan Robertse, Kwagga's competitive brother trying to buy a farm left to them by their dead father.  Mackay decides to steal the natives' cattle and sell it to rogue guerrilla fighters across the northern border. Kwagga's new friend, Inga Olefse, a lieutenant-doctor for U.N.T.A.G., who is unaware of Mackay's deceit, is kidnapped by the guerrillas but Kwagga rescues her and threatens his brother to not buy their father's farm or he will turn him in to the police. Kwagga, who has fallen in love with Inga, then decides to exact revenge of Mackay by ruining his platoon on the day it is to be inspected by the U.N. commander in charge of operations in Nambabwe. He does this by tricking each incompetent soldier, a [[Springbuck]]-obsessed [[Dutch people|Hollander]], ''Hendrick van den Ploes'' by faking his killing of a Springbuck and then covering him in animal blood so animals chase him into the base. He also disguises himself as a high-ranking Indian officer, ordering an automobile-challenged Bangladeshi Sergeant, ''Rashid'' to park and hide a tank, because he claims it is threatening to the U.N.'s peace efforts. He then again disguises himself, and sells fake rhino horn to a horn-obsessed Japanese soldier.  Mackay's chances of passing the inspection comes when he ignores an agreement made to his sidekick Zapman, who in turn blows up his office to try steal the diamond they had purchased with the stolen cattle. The U.N.T.A.G. platoon is disbanded, with Kwagga and Inga expressing their feelings for each other. Meanwhile, Mackay and Zapman wonder the Nambabwe desert with the diamond, only to find it is a forgery. As they argue about how angry they are, Kwagga accidentally lets off a cannon he keeps to chase away baboons, which in turn blast Mackay and Zapman to smithereens.

[[Wong Fei-hung]] travels from [[Foshan]] to [[Beijing]] with his romantic interest [[Thirteenth Aunt|13th Aunt]] and apprentice Leung Foon to meet his father, [[Wong Kei-ying]], at the [[Ten Tigers of Canton|Cantonese Ten Tigers Association]]. At the train station, 13th Aunt meets Tomanovsky, a Russian diplomat, who was her classmate when she was studying in Britain. He starts vying for her attention and annoys Wong, who is disgusted by the Western custom of kissing a woman's hand. When Wong reaches the Cantonese Ten Tigers Association, he learns that his father has been attacked by a wealthy rival martial artist, Chiu Tin-bak, and Chiu's henchman, Clubfoot, but sustained only minor injuries. Wong Kei-ying decides to give his blessings to his son and 13th Aunt when he sees they are becoming closer to each other.  Before the competition officially begins, all the lion dance troupes that have gathered in Beijing are already fighting among themselves and holding another competition of their own. Wong does not participate and spectates instead. Unknown to him, Leung and his friend have secretly joined the competition out of mischief. A short chase takes place between Clubfoot and Leung when the latter annoys the former during the contest and flees. Clubfoot's legs are crushed when Leung accidentally releases a stampede of horses from a stable. Chiu abandons Clubfoot when he sees that he is now a useless cripple. Wong takes pity on Clubfoot, brings him in, and heals his legs. Clubfoot is initially hostile towards Wong, but he feels so touched and grateful to Wong that he becomes Wong's new apprentice.  With the aid of a camera given to her by Tomanovsky, 13th Aunt inadvertently uncovers a plot to assassinate Li Hongzhang during the competition and learns that Tomanovsky is one of the conspirators. She warns Wong, who joins the contest to stop the assassins.

Just as Wong is about to leave, a [[Manchu people|Manchu]] general, A'lan Chengdu, shows up and tells him that the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] has challenged China to an international [[lion dance]] competition. The general is eager to recruit Wong to join him in representing China in the competition because Wong was the [[Once Upon a Time in China III|champion of the national lion dance competition]]. Since the competition is an international one, the contestants are not restricted to using only lion masks; other animal masks, such as dragon, centipede and eagle, are also present. Wong understands the gravity of the situation – China must win to uphold its sovereignty and regain lost national pride – and promises A'lan Chengdu that he will join the competition.  The [[Red Lanterns (Boxer Uprising)|Red Lantern Sect]] is a feminist and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] cult that goes around killing foreigners and destroying everything regarded as alien to Chinese culture. Its members are all female and are mainly armed with rope weapons, bows and [[ether]]-filled lanterns. When the cult attacks a German medical clinic, Wong intervenes and tries to stop them from killing the foreigners. German soldiers show up and capture Wong and Miao Sanniang, one of the cult members. A Catholic priest, Father Thomas, comes to Wong's aid and helps him and Miao escape from prison. In the meantime, the Red Lantern Sect's leader thinks that Wong has kidnapped Miao so she sends her followers to attack and capture Wong's companions. Wong goes to the cult's headquarters, fights his way through complex formations (with help from Miao), defeats the cult leader and saves his companions.  Wong is late for the lion dance competition because he was busy dealing with the Red Lantern Sect. A'lan Chengdu and his [[dragon dance]] teams decide to start without Wong. The competition turns out to be a brutal massacre as the other contestants have not only equipped their animal masks with various deadly weapons, but are also resorting to dirty tricks to ensure victory. By the time Wong reaches the arena, it is already too late as A'lan Chengdu has been killed by gunfire from a [[machine gun]] mounted on top of the stand where the champion's medal is.  After paying his respects at A'lan Chengdu's funeral, Wong sends Clubfoot to issue a challenge to the German general who oversaw the competition and request for a rematch. The general agrees. That night, the Red Lantern Sect causes trouble again by attacking a church. Miao Sanniang attempts to stop her fellow cult members from killing Father Thomas and Aunt 14th yet ends up killed by Iron Fist's accomplices. Wong shows up, defeats the cult members and rescues Thomas, Aunt 14th, and other foreigners. At the same time, the cult leader fights with Clubfoot until they are interrupted by German soldiers. Clubfoot escapes and hides, while the cult leader is slain by the German general's henchmen, Iron Fist and the [[rapier]]-wielding Duen Tin-lui, by shooting her and cutting her head off.  The following day, Wong and his well-prepared lion dance teams enter the competition arena to pit themselves against the other contestants. Shortly after they emerge victorious, they receive news that the forces of the Eight-Nation Alliance have [[Battle of Peking (1900)|defeated Chinese forces and occupied Beijing]]. Wong is enraged and wants to kill the German general to avenge A'lan Chengdu. He teams up with Clubfoot to defeat and kill Iron Fist and Duen Tin-lui, who try to stop them from killing the general. However, the general manages to escape even though he is seriously injured. Wong realises that it would make no difference even if he killed the general because he cannot reverse the situation in Beijing, so he returns to Foshan with his companions.

Later, Bhavani Singh discovers Tara has given birth to Prithvi's son and to his fury, orders his men to attack the gypsy colony and to kill Tara, her son and anyone who comes in the way. The Thakur's men set the camps ablaze, killing Tara but not her son, Ranvir. Shankar, who also survived the attack storms in to kill Bhavani Singh in revenge but he is arrested and imprisoned. Prithvi, tells his father that he will never acknowledge his presence again and despite living in the same house, his father will never hear his voice. Rajeshwari then presents him with the rescued Ranvir, earning the respect and love of her husband. Rajeshwari gives birth to a son Pratap, whom Bhavani Singh recognises as his true grandson. Both Ranvir and Pratap are brought up in the same household by Prithvi and Rajeshwari but both boys eventually realise that there is a difference between the two.  Gora Shankar is released from prison and returns to challenge Bhavani Singh to a pistol duel, but before the old man can respond, Prithvi intervenes and says the duel should be fought among equals and that Shankar should be duelling him, not his father. Shankar, who still sees Prithvi as his friend, reluctantly accepts and the duel is set for the next day.  Prithvi silently takes his father's blessing and heads to the hill alone. At the duel, both Shankar and Prithvi take their pistols and begin to pace away from each other. As the shot to turn and fire is heard, both men turn and aim - but only Shankar fires, shooting Prithvi in the chest. He runs immediately to Prithvi who reveals he never loaded his gun. As Prithvi dies, he tells Shankar to take Ranvir far away from his father, hoping no more blood will be shed in petty rivalry. At Prithvi's funeral, both Bhavani Singh and Gora Shankar draw their swords and challenge each other but are stopped by Rajeshwari. Shankar takes Ranvir and leaves the region for good.  Years later, both of Prithvi's sons meet in college as strangers, not knowing the identity of the other. Firstly rivals, the two become close friends but after Pratap ([[Saif Ali Khan]]) recognises Gora Shankar at Ranvir's ([[Aamir Khan]]) house, the two quickly realise that their past is linked but after years of being influenced by their respective guardians, they share a hatred of one another's families. Ranvir blames Bhavani Singh for killing his mother, while Pratap blames Shankar for killing his father.  Despite the efforts of Shankar and Rajeshwari to end the fighting which will only lead to tragedy, Ranvir ends up challenging his grandfather Bhanvi Singh to a duel. Pratap, echoing the words of his father years ago, states that the duel should be fought among equals and with that the challenge is set.  The next day Pratap arrives with Rajeshwari and Ranvir with Shankar. Just as the battle is about to start, Bhavani shows up on his horse to watch from a distance. The two brothers turn their back to each other and start to pace away. As they do this their grandfather watches them and begins to see visions of his son Prithvi as he looks at both Ranvir and Pratap. The signal to turn and shoot is given and both men turn and fire instinctively - only to see their grandfather between them having taken both their bullets. As Bhavani stumbles to the ground, he cries out for Prithvi, revealing the years of torment of losing his son. The brothers rush to the fallen old man who in his last moments tells them of his regret and hopes that with his death there is no further bloodshed.  After the funeral, Ranvir and Pratap are about to head their separate ways but stop to embrace each other as brothers for the first time.

Callahan is killed by a [[car bomb]]; Darby manages to avoid the same fate and is subsequently attacked by an unknown assailant. Realizing that her brief was accurate, she goes into hiding and reaches out to Verheek for assistance.  An informant calling himself Garcia contacts ''Washington Herald'' reporter Gray Grantham with information about the assassinations, but  suddenly disappears. Darby contacts Gray, who finds her information is accurate. Darby's computer, disks, and files disappear from her home, where she is again attacked but manages to escape. She contacts and agrees to meet Verheek, but Khamel kills Verheek and impersonates him at the meet. Before Khamel can kill Darby, he is shot and killed by an unknown person.  Darby agrees to meet Gray in New York City, where she shares the theory expressed in her brief: the assassinations were done on behalf of oil tycoon Victor Mattiece, who intends to drill for oil on Louisiana marshland that is habitat for an endangered species of [[brown pelican]]s. A court appeal to deny Mattiece the drilling rights is expected to reach the Supreme Court. Darby has surmised that Mattiece, hoping to turn the case in his favor, is behind the justices' murders, given their history of environmentalism. When Gray tells her about Garcia, they discover that the man is Curtis Morgan, a lawyer in the oil and gas division at the [[Washington, DC]] law firm of White & Blazevich.  Darby visits White & Blazevich, pretending to have an appointment with Morgan, and is told he had been killed. Suspecting that his murder was related to the incriminating information, she and Gray visit his widow who gives them a key to a safe deposit box. Darby visits the bank to retrieve the contents of the box. After barely escaping death by a car bomb and assassination in a parking garage, they reach the ''Washington Herald'' building where they review the documents and a videotape recovered from Morgan's box. The tape confirms Darby's theory, as Morgan's documents prove his own discovery that Mattiece ordered the assassination of the Justices. With this evidence, Gray writes his story. He gives the FBI a chance to comment and FBI Director Denton Voyles confirms that Darby's "Pelican Brief" was delivered to the White House. He reveals (off the record) the President ordered the FBI to "back off", and that the CIA is investigating Mattiece, with one of them killing Khamel to save Darby's life. A plane is arranged for Darby to flee the country.  Darby is watching a TV interview of Gray where it is revealed that Mattiece and two partners at White & Blazevich have been indicted in federal court, the President's chief of staff has resigned, and the President (who received $4.2 million in contributions from Mattiece) will not seek reelection. Gray deflects speculation that Darby is fictional, but does agree that she is "almost" too good to be true. Darby smiles.

Philadelphia (film)
  Andrew Beckett is a senior associate at the largest corporate law firm in Philadelphia. He hides his homosexuality and his status as an [[AIDS]] patient from the other members of the firm. A partner in the firm notices a lesion on Beckett's forehead. Although Beckett attributes the lesion to a racquetball injury, it indicates [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], an AIDS defining condition.  Shortly thereafter, Beckett stays home from work for several days to try to find a way to hide his lesions. While at home, he finishes the paperwork for a case he has been assigned and then brings it to his office, leaving instructions for his assistants to file the paperwork the following day, which marks the end of the statute of limitations for the case. Later that morning, he receives a call asking for the paperwork, as the paper copy cannot be found and there are no copies on the computer's hard drive. The paperwork is finally discovered in an alternate location and is filed with the court at the last possible moment. The following day, Beckett is dismissed by the firm's partners.  Beckett believes that someone deliberately hid his paperwork to give the firm an excuse to fire him, and that the dismissal is actually as a result of his diagnosis with AIDS. He asks several attorneys to take his case, including personal injury lawyer Joe Miller. The homophobic Miller appears to be worried that he could contract Beckett's illness. After declining to take the case, Miller immediately visits his doctor to find out if he could have contracted the disease. The doctor explains that the routes of HIV infection do not include casual contact.  Unable to find a lawyer willing to represent him, Beckett is compelled to act as his own attorney. While researching a case at a law library, Miller sees Beckett at a nearby table. After a library employee stares down Miller, presumably because Miller is black, a librarian approaches Beckett and announces that he has found a book on AIDS discrimination for him. As others in the library begin to first stare uneasily, the librarian suggests Beckett to go to a private room.  Feeling discouraged by the other people's behavior and seeing the parallels in how he himself has been unfairly treated, Miller approaches Beckett, reviews the material he has gathered, and takes the case.  As the case goes before the court, the partners of the firm take the stand, each claiming that Beckett was incompetent and that he had deliberately tried to hide his condition. The defense repeatedly suggests that Beckett brought AIDS upon himself by having gay sex, and is therefore not a victim. In the course of testimony, it is revealed that the partner who had noticed Beckett's lesion, Walter Kenton, had previously worked with a woman who had contracted AIDS after a blood transfusion and so should have recognized the lesion as relating to AIDS.  According to that partner, the woman was an innocent victim, unlike Beckett, and further testified that he did not recognize Beckett's lesions. To prove that the lesions would have been visible, Miller asks Beckett to unbutton his shirt while on the witness stand, revealing that his lesions are indeed visible and recognizable as such.  Beckett eventually collapses during the trial. After Beckett is hospitalized, another partner, Bob Seidman, who noticed Beckett's lesions confesses that he suspected Beckett had AIDS but never told anyone and never gave him the opportunity to explain himself, which he regretted very much. During his hospitalization, the jury votes in Beckett's favor, awarding him back pay, damages for pain and suffering and punitive damages, totaling over $5 million. Miller visits the visibly failing Beckett in the hospital after the verdict and overcomes his fear enough to touch Beckett's face. After Beckett's family leaves the room, he tells his partner Miguel that he is ready to die. At the Miller home, Joe and his wife are awakened by a phone call from Miguel, who tells them that Beckett has died. A memorial is held at Beckett's home following the funeral, where many mourners, including Miller, view home movies of Beckett as a happy child.  
A Perfect World

Fleeing, the pair stumble into a house where eight-year-old Phillip Perry ([[T.J. Lowther]]) lives with his devout [[Jehovah's Witness]] mother and two sisters. Needing a [[hostage]] to aid their escape, Butch grabs the boy, who meekly accompanies them. The trio's journey starts off on an unpleasant note as Butch kills Terry, following the latter's attempt to harm the child. With his partner out of the way, the convict and his young victim take to the Texas highway in a bid to flee from the pursuing police.  Meanwhile, Texas Ranger Red Garnett ([[Clint Eastwood]]), riding in the Governor's [[airstream]] trailer, is in pursuit. With [[criminologist]] Sally Gerber ([[Laura Dern]]) and trigger-happy [[FBI]] [[marksman|sharpshooter]] Bobby Lee ([[Bradley Whitford]]) in tow, Red is determined to recover the criminal and the hostage before they cross the Texas border. Also, Red reveals to Sally that he has a personal interest in apprehending Butch alive.  Even though Butch doesn't realize it, Red has a history with him.  When Butch was a teenager, he stole a car, and Red was the arresting officer.  Butch was living with his abusive father, also a criminal, at the time. Due to his age and it being a first offense, Butch was supposed to get a lenient sentence.  Red thought juvenile prison was safer for Butch than home, and muses that some of the kids who went through Gatesville turned out ok, and one even became a priest. He also felt that if Butch had been left at home with his father, he would have a rap sheet "as long as my arm." Red asks the judge to give Butch a harsh sentence. Years later, Red has come to realize that the harsher sentence only encouraged the very life of crime he feared would happen.  Now, Red is hoping that if he can bring Butch in alive, he can redeem himself for his past mistake.  Phillip, eight years old, has never participated in [[Halloween]] or [[Christmas]] celebrations. Escaping with Butch, however, he experiences a freedom which he finds exhilarating, as Butch gladly allows him the kind of indulgences he has been forbidden all along, including the wearing of a shoplifted [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]] costume. Gradually, Phillip becomes increasingly aware of his surroundings, and with constant encouragement from Butch, seems to acquire the ability to make independent decisions on what is wrong and right.  For his part, Butch slowly finds himself drawn into giving Phillip the kind of fatherly presence which he himself never had.   Butch and Phillip try to make it to New Mexico, but find out that the highway they are driving on is unfinished.  While asleep in their car in a cornfield, they encounter Mack, a farmer and his family, Lottie his wife, and his grandson Cleveland. Mack frequently abuses Cleveland, which Butch tries to tolerate, but when they figure out who he is, he puts a stop to it. He beats Mack and plans on killing him, but Phillip takes his gun and shoots him in the stomach.  Then he gets out of the house, drops the gun into a well, throws the car keys away and runs across a meadow. Butch follows him and rests at the tree Phillip has climbed. In the following dialogue Phillip apologizes for shooting Butch who tells him he did the right thing.  Red's team surrounds the place where Phillip and Butch are situated, the latter sending the boy away to his mother, who is with Red's team. Unwilling to leave the already wounded Butch, the boy runs back and hugs him – a gesture which, along with his knowledge of Butch's character and background, convinces Red that he can resolve the situation peacefully. His plans are thwarted, however, when Bobby Lee, mistaking one of Butch's gestures to suppose he is about to draw a gun, fires a shot into his chest and kills him. The move leaves Red angry and frustrated at his inability to save Butch and take him alive. Red then punches Bobby Lee and Sally kicks him in the groin before walking away. Phillip is then reunited with his mother, and the two of them fly away in a helicopter while Phillip sadly looks at Butch's lifeless body in the meadow as they fly away.

His business is slowly failing, Ben's school attendance has dropped and the banks are threatening to foreclose on his house; however, he refuses financial help from Professor Longstreet, the original project director, in exchange for rejoining the Navy. In addition to this, he has also been having painful experiences which Longstreet rationalizes as stress-related hallucinations. Unbeknownst to Herdeg, however, Longstreet has been doing some research of his own.  In a demonstration, engineer William Mailer (son of Friedrich Mahler, a Nazi scientist who worked on a project similar to the Philadelphia Experiment) uses the technology as a demonstration for a potential teleportation attack-defense strategy. The concept was to "beam" a bomber into a high-risk area to surprise enemy air defenses, attack and escape before they could react. To demonstrate, he beams a model aircraft from one end of the room to another. Despite getting significant interest, Longstreet manages to convince the panel that the technology is too dangerous to use. It is then revealed that Longstreet himself gave Mailer the necessary equipment - on condition that they be used only for test purposes. It is these tests that David is experiencing.  Herdeg, meanwhile, is furious to learn that Longstreet has lied to him, and packs to leave California, hoping to get far enough away from the experiment. Meanwhile, Mailer, on the clock to vindicate his work, attempts to use the technology on a stealth [[F-117 Nighthawk]] they were using as part of the demonstration. The Nighthawk disappears, and David finds himself in agony as the world around him changes and his son disappears. David finds himself on the run from armed forces and is rescued by Jess, a member of an underground resistance group, who explains that [[Nazi Germany]] won [[World War II]] and the United States are about to mark 50 years as a Nazi conquest. America is under authoritarian rule, with its citizens surviving under an oppressive dictatorship. David is horrified to learn that his son no longer exists.  In this alternative timeline, Germany won the war because it had a futuristic aircraft called the ''Phoenix'', to deliver [[atomic bomb]]s, destroying [[Washington, D.C.]], and other major targets on the east coast. The United States became demoralized and eventually surrendered to Nazi Germany. The Phoenix was destroyed in the explosion and Friedrich Mahler, the scientist who took credit for building it, was ridiculed since he was unable to reproduce "his" successful design. The aircraft was, in fact, the same F-117 from Mailer's experiment, accidentally sent back in time.  The first test of the device was to transport an F-117 with a payload of nuclear weapons to [[Ramstein Air Base]] in Germany. While the aircraft was successfully teleported to Ramstein, it was also transferred through time, arriving in 1943 Nazi Germany (the US pilot's fate is unknown). Mahler finds it and tells the Nazis that it is his invention.  Because of Herdeg's unique blood, he is recruited by Longstreet - the leader of the rebels in this timeline - to go back and prevent the alteration to the timeline. During an attack on the base, their commander, Mailer, seemingly joins their side - however it is a ruse to go through back in time and warn his father about what will happen during the initial bombing and how to avert it, and he betrays them, leaving them to be ambushed by Nazi forces as he opens a portal for himself. Herdeg follows him through the portal as the other rebels, Jess included, sacrifice themselves to buy him time.  Herdeg is warped back to the night before the F-117 (now repainted in Luftwaffe colors) launches to attack Washington and successfully destroys the aircraft. However, Mailer attacks him from behind and tries to kill him as he is leaving in revenge for ruining his plans. Herdeg shoot and kills Mahler and his son, Mailer, is erased from the timeline. Since he was never born, the [[grandfather paradox]] erases the aircraft teleportation project from existence and restores the timeline to normal. Herdeg travels back through the time portal and picks up his son at a baseball game - and waves to a now-alive but bemused Jess.

The Piano
 A mute [[Scots people|Scotswoman]] named Ada McGrath is sold by her father into marriage to a New Zealand frontiersman named Alisdair Stewart, bringing her young daughter Flora with her. Ada has not spoken a word since she was six and no one, including herself, knows why. She expresses herself through her piano playing and through sign language, for which her daughter has served as the interpreter. Flora, it is later learned, is the product of a relationship with a teacher with whom Ada believed she could communicate through her mind, but who "became frightened and stopped listening," and thus left her.  Ada, Flora, and their belongings, including a hand crafted piano, are deposited on a New Zealand beach by a ship's crew. The following day, Alisdair arrives with a [[Māori people|Māori]] crew and his white friend, Baines, a fellow forester and retired sailor who has adopted many of the Maori customs, including [[Ta moko|tattooing his face]]. Alisdair tells Ada that there is no room in his small house for the piano and abandons the piano on the beach. Ada, in turn, is cold to him and is determined to be reunited with her piano. Unable to communicate with Alisdair, Ada and Flora visit Baines with a note asking to be taken to the piano. He explains that he cannot read. Baines soon suggests that Alisdair trade the instrument to him for some land. Alisdair consents, and agrees to his further request to receive lessons from Ada, oblivious to his attraction to her. Ada is enraged when she learns that Alisdair has traded away her precious piano without consulting her. During one visit, Baines proposes that Ada can earn her piano back at a rate of one piano key per "lesson", provided that he can observe her and do "things he likes" while she plays. She agrees, but negotiates for a number of lessons equal to the number of black keys only. While Ada and her husband Alisdair have had no sexual, nor even mildly affectionate, interaction, the lessons with Baines become a slow seduction for her affection. Baines requests gradually increased intimacy in exchange for greater numbers of keys. Ada reluctantly accepts but does not give herself to him the way he desires. Realizing that she only does what she has to in order to regain the piano, and that she has no romantic feelings for him, Baines gives up and simply returns the piano to Ada, saying that their arrangement "is making you a whore, and me wretched", and that what he really wants is for her to actually care for him.  Despite Ada having her piano back, she ultimately finds herself missing Baines watching her as she plays. She returns to him one afternoon, where they submit to their desire for one another. Alisdair, having become suspicious of their relationship, hears them having sex as he walks by Baines' house, and then watches them through a crack in the wall. Outraged, he follows her the next day and confronts her in the forest, where he attempts to force himself on her, despite her intense resistance. He eventually exacts a promise from Ada that she will not see Baines.  Soon afterwards, Ada sends her daughter with a package for Baines, containing a single piano key with an inscribed love declaration reading "Dear George you have my heart Ada McGrath". Flora does not want to deliver the package and brings the piano key instead to Alisdair. After reading the love note burnt onto the piano key, Alisdair furiously returns home with an ax and cuts off Ada's index finger to deprive her of the ability to play the piano. He then sends Flora who witnessed this to Baines with the severed finger wrapped in cloth, with the message that if Baines ever attempts to see Ada again, he will chop off more fingers. Later that night, while touching Ada in her sleep, Alisdair hears what he believes to be Ada's voice inside of his head, asking him to let Baines take her away. Deeply shaken, he goes to Baines' house and asks if she has ever spoken words to him. Baines assures him she has not. Ultimately, it is assumed that he decides to send Ada and Flora away with Baines and dissolve their marriage once she has recovered from her injuries. They depart from the same beach on which she first landed in New Zealand. While being rowed to the ship with her baggage and Ada's piano tied onto a Māori longboat, Ada asks Baines to throw the piano overboard. As it sinks, she deliberately tangles her foot in the rope trailing after it. She is pulled overboard but, deep under water, changes her mind and kicks free and is pulled to safety.  In an [[epilogue]], Ada describes her new life with Baines and Flora in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], where she has started to give piano lessons in their new home, and her severed finger has been replaced with a silver finger made by Baines. Ada has also started to take speech lessons in order to learn how to speak again.  
Point of No Return (1993 film)
 Maggie Hayward ([[Bridget Fonda]]) is a [[drug addict]] found guilty of [[murdering]] a cop during a [[robbery]] shootout, and is about to be [[sentenced to death]] by [[lethal injection]]. Her demise is faked and a [[spy]] named Bob ([[Gabriel Byrne]]) informs her that she has to work for him. Maggie, having little choice, reluctantly agrees to cooperate and she begins a regimen of intensive training that includes not only martial arts and firearms training, but [[etiquette]] and computer use.  Senior Operative Amanda ([[Anne Bancroft]]) transforms her into a refined, beautiful woman. She is taken on a dinner date with Bob, who informs her about the first job: an assassination of a VIP eating at the same restaurant. Maggie kills the VIP and his bodyguard and then is pursued by a team of the VIP's bodyguards. She shoots several of the bodyguards and then escapes from the kitchen by jumping down a laundry chute. This task was her final test and she has now completed her training.  The following morning she leaves for [[Venice, California]], where she enters into a romantic relationship with apartment house manager J.P. ([[Dermot Mulroney]]). While her first assignments, both hit jobs, are ultimately successful, Maggie quickly comes to hate her work and tries to quit her job as a professional killer. As things progress between her and J.P. and her double life threatens their relationship, she asks for help in leaving the agency. Her request is denied, but Bob agrees to get her out of the agency if she completes the next task.  The new job is to masquerade as Angela ([[Olivia d'Abo]]), the girlfriend of Fahd Bakhtiar ([[Richard Romanus]]), an [[Iran]]ian trading in [[nuclear weapons]]. As she prepares for the job, J.P. continues to complain about her mysterious friends and mocks the improvised backstory that Bob had provided for himself and Maggie. Maggie is shown watching a scene from ''[[Deception_(1946_film)|Deception]]'', in which a woman kills a former lover in order to keep their past secret from her new husband, reflecting Maggie's determination to kill her employers if necessary to protect her relationship with J.P.  Taking out Angela proves problematic and results in the deaths of Angela's two bodyguards and the injury of Maggie's partner, Beth ([[Lorraine Toussaint]]). Director Kaufman then sends in Victor, a "cleaner" ([[Harvey Keitel]]) to get rid of the bodies and salvage the mission. Unknown to Maggie, he has also been ordered to kill both agents as well because one failure results in death. After killing the wounded Beth in front of Maggie, he drives her to Fahd's home. At gunpoint she gets Fahd to unlock his computer and reveal his secrets, but he avoids execution and she is forced to flee.  As they purportedly drive back to her residence, Maggie sees a gun in Victor's waistband and correctly suspects that he is going to kill her. This leads to a struggle and the car spins out of control. Ultimately, Victor is dragged over a ravine and killed. Maggie makes her way back to her apartment, but leaves sometime during the night. Bob subsequently learns of her disappearance from J.P. As Bob is leaving, he sees Maggie watching him through the mist. Instead of reporting her, he calls Kaufman and informs him, after some hesitation, that the cleaner and Maggie are both dead.  
Poetic Justice (film)
  Justice ([[Janet Jackson]]) is a young woman living in [[South Central, Los Angeles]]. She was named Justice by her late mother, who gave birth to her while attending [[law school]]. After the shooting death of her boyfriend Markell ([[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]]), Justice falls into a deep depression. She spends the majority of her time in the house that she inherited from her grandmother, with her cat White Boy, only going out to her job at a local hair salon. Justice is a talented poet, and she reads many of her poems throughout the course of the film, both to other characters and in voice over.  Justice is at the hair salon working one day when a young postal clerk named Lucky ([[Tupac Shakur]]) comes in and begins flirting with her. She rebuffs his advances with the help of her female boss; the two women pretend to be [[lesbian]]s and mock Lucky with their "relationship".  Lucky has also had tragedy in his life: his main focus is caring for his young daughter Keisha. He had to forcibly remove her from the care of her mother, Angel, a crack addict who was using drugs and having sex with her drug dealer while leaving the child unattended in the apartment. Lucky dreams of a professional career in music and shows considerable promise, but he insists that his cousin is the true talent.  Justice's friend Iesha ([[Regina King]]) manages to talk Justice into taking a road trip to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] with Iesha's boyfriend, Chicago ([[Joe Torry]]), Lucky's co-worker at the post office. Justice warily accepts, mainly because she has to go to Oakland for a hair show and her car had stopped working at the last minute. Unbeknownst to Justice, Lucky is also on the trip, and she will now be sharing a postal van with him and their two mutual friends. Initially they argue, but they soften towards each other as they discover their similarities over the course of the film.  The foursome make a couple of detours, the first being a family reunion barbecue they see signs for on the road. Here it becomes apparent (although there were ample hints earlier) that Iesha and Chicago's relationship is troubled. Iesha openly flirts with other men at the barbecue, while Chicago broods watching her behavior. Iesha and Chicago argue in the mailtruck until Justice talks to Iesha about her behavior with alcohol. Iesha throws up and cries on Justice and apologizes to her. The second stop is a beach where each of the four characters contemplate their separate situations in internal monologues. Next, they stop at an African Cultural Fair where Lucky and Justice grow closer as they discuss their lives. After leaving the fair, the friction between Chicago and Iesha explodes when Iesha informs Chicago that she has been seeing someone on the side, and he physically attacks her. Lucky initially decides not to get involved in the fight until Justice defends Iesha by kicking Chicago in the groin, and Chicago turns his physical brutality at Justice in retaliation. Lucky, Justice, along with a bleeding and shaken Iesha leave Chicago by the side of the road and continue on their journey.  Lucky stops the postal van at a beach, and Justice goes to see what's wrong. She begins opening up to him about her life, and Lucky becomes sympathetic. They share a kiss, and Justice walks away apparently unsure of her feelings for Lucky. She goes back to him, and kiss again.  When the now-threesome arrive in Oakland, they are met with the news that Lucky's cousin, with whom he had been working on recording music, has been killed. Lucky blames himself for not being in Oakland sooner, believing he could have prevented the shooting had he been in town. He turns his anger on Justice, angrily blaming her for distracting him while they were on the road. Jessie gives Justice and Iesha advice about men before the hair show. Lucky's uncle and aunt give Lucky his cousin's recording equipment. Lucky decides not to come back to work and to take care of Keisha.  Some months have passed, and Lucky meets up with Justice again back at the hair salon, just at the moment he brings in his daughter Keisha. Lucky is remorseful over his conduct in Oakland and the cruel words he said to Justice there, and apologizes. She smiles at him and they share a passionate kiss. Justice smiles coyly, and then turns her attention to Keisha, fussing over her hair. Justice and Lucky's eyes meet over Keisha's head and they smile, their connection as strong as ever.  
The Pickle
  Danny Aiello stars as Harry Stone, an NYC film director who has been living in [[Paris, France]] for the past ten years. Despite the fact that he still has a loyal fan base, his last three films were flops, and he returns to New York to hear a pitch from a studio executive. The movie turns out to be ''The Pickle'', a science fiction film with an absurd storyline, but when the executive offers him "a ton of money," Harry immediately sells out his better judgment and agrees to direct the picture.  Aside from a few flashbacks to Harry's childhood, and to the events leading up to the making of ''The Pickle'', most of the story takes place on the day of the new film's premiere. Harry is reunited with his agent, publicist, son, daughter, mother, and ex-wives (both of whom are still on good terms with Harry), and the movie explores these relationships in various combinations; Harry's Parisian girlfriend also plays a major role. Despite Harry's stress about the upcoming premiere—he regrets selling out to make ''The Pickle'', and fears that it will ruin his career—the director spends time to enjoy the people in his life.  ===Harry's Career=== Dialogue establishes several details about Harry's career:  His biggest success was a Western called ''Blue Sands''; his most recent film, ''Paradise Jack'', was a hit with his fans, but trashed by the critics and a disappointment at the box office. Harry had ambitions to make cinematic adaptations of ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' and ''[[Huckleberry Finn]]'', but funding fell through after the [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]] of ''Paradise Jack''. His dream project is to direct an epic about [[Hernán Cortés|Cortez]] and [[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]] starring [[Dustin Hoffman]] (despite his admission that Hoffman is too old for either role), but he angrily balks when a studio executive suggests updating the story to a present-day L.A. [[barrio]]. The success of ''The Pickle'' leads the executive to greenlight the Cortez/ Montezuma film, but Harry instead pitches a drama with a storyline loosely mirroring the events of his own return to New York.  ===The Movie Within the Movie=== The movie featured within the movie—also called ''The Pickle''—involves a group of farmers who grow a pickle to gigantic proportions and convert it into a spaceship, which they fly into outer space. They land on a planet nearly identical to Earth, where one of the farmers (played by [[Ally Sheedy]]) develops a romance with an advisor to the [[President of the United States]]. (The President is played by [[Little Richard]] as himself, and performs an impromptu rendition of "[[Good Golly, Miss Molly]]".)  The romance is ended when Sheedy decides that, as a vegetarian, she cannot live on a planet where all food is made out of meat.  
Platform (1993 film)
  ''Platform'' follows the story of two brothers, Raju ([[Ajay Devgn]]) and his elder brother Vikram, who at a young age lose their mother, after which Raju is brought up by Vikram, by working at a hotel run by a kind hearted Bhaiya saab. Hariya ([[Mohnish Bahl]]) is a drug addict on bad terms with Bhaiya saab, and one night, being high, guns down Bhaiya saab when the latter would be taking a walk with Vikram. On the scene bursts inspector Joshi ([[Kiran Kumar]]), who tries to arrest Vikram thinking him to be the man behind the murder. But Vikram breaks away, and plans to run away from the city with Raju. At the railway station, while waiting for the train, he leaves Raju for a moment, only to be caught by Inspector Joshi.  Raju in the meantime, thinks his brother has abandoned him at the platform and run off in a train. He is then approached by Hariya, who convinces him that Vikram will never return, and then takes care of Raju as his own, in order to make him part of his gang for his benefit. Vikram, in the meantime is sentenced to imprisonment on charges of murder, and years later Raju grows up to be an efficient henchman of Hariya.  So the story moves, with Raju eliminating all Hariya's enemies and foiling their plans, with the exception of his arch rival Shetty ([[Paresh Rawal]]). After nearly completing his sentence, Vikram breaks out of jail when he hears that Raju is still alive, and is being brought up by Hariya, in order to meet his brother and expose Hariya. But Raju still thinks his brother abandoned him on the platform, and refuses to accept Vikram when he comes to him, and even does not let the latter harm Hariya.  Shetty is keen on wiping out both Hariya and Raju, not listening to his astrologer twin brother Shani avatar ([[Paresh Rawal]] in a double-role), who keeps telling him his crooked ways will land him in trouble. At one point of time, Raju treacherously makes away with cash from Shetty, but not before being shot in the leg by Joshi, who arrives at the scene and is already upset over Vikram breaking out of jail, and also keeping close watch on Hariya and Raju.  Shetty, enraged over Raju's act, arranges for Raju to be killed, but Raju escapes. Finally, Vikram goes to Shetty for help in eliminating Hariya and saving Raju, to which Shetty agrees on his conditions. Raju and Hariya get to know of this, and Hariya tells Raju it's finally time to eliminate Shetty and Vikram. Vikram also goes to Joshi and tells him the whole story, and the latter agrees to help, but Vikram is then kidnapped by Shetty's men. Shetty then threatens Raju with dire consequences for his brother and their lady loves if he does not return the money he stole.  Raju is now in a fix; if he does not return the money, his brother will be killed, and if he does, Hariya won't spare him. Finally, he decides to save his brother, come what may. But Hariya gets the wind of it, and he joins hands with Shetty to eliminate both Raju and Vikram.  The climax finally reaches the platform, where Raju finds Vikram hung by his arms just above a railway track, with Hariya and Shetty at the scene. Raju then plays a trick; he throws down the money from the suitcase, pours alcohol over it, and threatens to burn it with a lighter if any one tries anything funny, and if Hariya does not confess to his role in the killings and separation of two brothers. Shetty, worried that the money might burn, threatens Hariya at gunpoint to do so, which he does. Out comes Inspector Joshi, saying he has heard everything, and then all hell breaks loose, with Raju gunning down the gangsters, freeing his brother just in time as a speeding train engine comes up the tracks and runs over Vikram as he falls on the tracks, without harming him.  Shetty is arrested. But Hariya manages to give them the slip. Raju manages to catch up with Hariya, clinging onto his speeding car and fighting him till it overturns and a fuel leak starts to occur. Raju's old rival turns up and he along with Hariya start to attack Raju brutally. But Raju, strengthened by his mother's parting gift, a chain, mounts strength and beats them off, just as an explosion produced by the leaking fuel sets the car in flames, killing Hariya and Raju's adversary.  Just as Vikram and the others watch the explosion, thinking Raju is gone, out of the debris comes Raju and falls into the arms of Vikram. Thus, the two brothers are finally reunited.

Posse (1993 film)
  In 1898, [[Buffalo Soldiers]] from the U.S. Army's [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry Regiment]], led by Jessie Lee ([[Mario Van Peebles]]), are fighting in the [[Spanish–American War]] in [[Cuba]]. As the segregated [[African American|African-American]] unit is barely holding its own against constant attacks from enemy troops, Jesse runs back to the command post of the corrupt and racist Colonel Graham ([[Billy Zane]]) to request that the 10th Cavalry be allowed to pull back. Colonel Graham orders Jessie to shoot a deserter in exchange for allowing the 10th to retreat. Unable to kill a man in cold blood, Jessie demonstrates excellent marksmanship by shooting the man's cigar from his mouth. Colonel Graham then kills the deserter, and offers Jessie's command of the 10th to Little J ([[Stephen Baldwin]]), another White prisoner (the alternative would be to face the firing squad). Graham then orders the 10th to fall back in order to begin another mission, one in which they will be required to wear civilian clothing, as opposed to their Cavalry uniforms. They are ordered to rob a Spanish gold shipment, which is a setup to give the Colonel an excuse to execute the entire 10th Cavalry as deserters. As he meets them with his own cavalry force, his aide Weezie ([[Charles Lane (filmmaker)|Charles Lane]]) causes a distraction, allowing the 10th to shoot the Colonel and his cavalry down.  With Colonel Graham and his troops supposedly dead, the remnants of the 10th—including Jessie, Obobo ([[Tom Lister, Jr.|Tiny Lister]]), Angel ([[Tone Lōc]]) and Little J, along with Weezie—sneak out of Cuba and Jessie leads them to [[New Orleans]]. Soon after arriving their arrival, Little J meets a gambler named Father Time ([[Big Daddy Kane]]) and they begin playing poker, at which point Time is caught cheating. Little J helps the gambler escape and they go back to the hotel room where the others are hiding, telling them "We were never here" in fear that the vengeful gamblers might come for them. Doing just as J feared, the gamblers come in search of him and Father Time, only to be shot in the back by Colonel Graham and his troops, who survived the skirmish in Cuba. Angel is killed in the firefight while Little J, Father Time and the others barely escape. They meet up with Jessie who had left earlier to finish some business in a town out West.  The newly formed "posse" heads West with Colonel Graham on their heels every step of the way. They eventually stop in a town where Jessie has ammunition custom-made out of gold in order to kill the demons of his past, using one to kill the man who made the ammunition—as he was one of the men who lynched Jesse's father King David ([[Robert Hooks]]) years earlier (Father Time later explains that the [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] ladies in New Orleans believe that gold is the only way to kill a demon). They make their way to Freemanville, a town founded by King David and composed entirely of African-Americans. Jessie is reunited with several old acquaintances, including his good friend Carver ([[Blair Underwood]]), who is now the sheriff of Freemanville. Carver's deputy goes to Cutterstown, not wanting to tip anyone off that Carver is working with Cutterstown's sheriff, Bates ([[Richard Jordan]]). He informs Bates that Jessie has returned to Freemanville. The "posse" enjoys the hospitality of Freemanville until Bates tells Carver that the town will burn unless Jessie is turned over to him and his deputies (Sheriff Bates and one of his deputies were men that had lynched King David, and were afraid that Jessie had come back for revenge). Bates and a few of his deputies attack Freemanville that same night looking for Jessie. One of the deputies beats Weezie in order to get answers. Watching in disgust, Little J fights back in defense of Weezie. Outnumbered, Little J is kicked and beaten to death by Bates and his men, and while Obobo and Jessie's former mentor Papa Joe ([[Melvin Van Peebles]]) are taken to Cutterstown as prisoners. Jessie and Father Time soon rescue them by posing as [[Ku Klux Klan]] members and storming into the Cutterstown jail. Jessie kills one of the deputies, who was another one of King David's murderers.  When he returns he convinces the townspeople to fight Sheriff Bates by telling them he wants the land for himself to sell to the railroad when it comes through. The citizens of Freemanville fight Bates the next day when he rides in. As they begin to gain the upper hand, Colonel Graham arrives with his cavalry and a [[Gatling gun]] which he uses to cut the people down. Jessie charges the gun with a stick of dynamite destroying the gun and killing some of Graham's troops.  Meanwhile, Carver plans to flee with the deeds to all of the property in Freemanville—all of which are in his name—but is stopped by Papa Joe's daughter Lana ([[Salli Richardson]]). Father Time shows up just in time to stop Carver from harming Lana. Time kills one of Carver's deputies, but is killed by Carver. Before Carver can flee, he is stopped by Bates who reveals that they had a deal to split the proceeds from the land 50-50. Jessie arrives just in time to hear about the deal, and watches as Carver is betrayed and murdered by Bates. Jessie kills Bates in a showdown, finally putting his past demons to rest. Colonel Graham captures Lana and orders Jesse into the saloon, where they have a climactic fight resulting in Graham's death and the destruction of the saloon (which Graham had set ablaze). Jessie, Obobo, Weezie and Lana watch as the townspeople fight the fire.  The story ends almost a century later with an old man ([[Woody Strode]]) being interviewed by reporters ([[Reginald Hudlin]], [[Warrington Hudlin]]) about the black [[cowboy]]s of the [[American Frontier|Old West]]. The man, who was a young boy when he met Jessie in Freemanville, gives the reporters a small book that Jessie had given him.  In the end, a caption goes on to tell that there had been over 8,000 black cowboys in the Old West whose stories had never been told due to omission by [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and others alike.

Puppet Master 4
 In the [[underworld]] of [[Hell]], a demon lord named [[Set_(deity)|Sutekh]] sends forth a trio of [[diminutive]] [[servants]] called the [[Totems]], magically controlled by his [[Underworld|netherworld]] [[wikt:minion|minion]]s, to kill those who possess the [[Immortality|secret of animation]], including the [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] [[Andre Toulon|André Toulon]] used to give his puppets life. It transpires also that a team of researchers working on the development of [[artificial intelligence]] are close to discovering Toulon's secret. Sutekh sends one of the Totems as a package to two of the researchers involved, Dr. Piper and Dr. Baker of the [[Phoenix Division]], who are taken by surprise, killed and stripped of their souls by the foul creature.  One of the researchers, a talented young man named Rick Myers, is working as a [[Property caretaker|caretaker]] at the [[Hotel Green|Bodega Bay Inn]] and has also been using it for a place to conduct his [[experiment]]s on the A.I. project. The same night Drs. Piper and Baker are [[murdered]], Rick's friends Suzie, Lauren, and Cameron come to visit him. At dinner, Lauren, who is a psychic, finds Blade (who had been discovered earlier by Rick inside the house and is still animate) and then Toulon's old trunk, with the puppets, Toulons [[diary]] and some vials with the [[Potion|life-giving formula]] inside. Out of curiosity, Rick and his friends use the fluid on the puppets, and one by one they awaken; next to Blade, they find Pinhead, Six Shooter, Tunneler and Jester. (Torch, who joins the puppet cast in the sequel, makes no appearance here.)  Fascinated by the puppets' spontaneous reactions, and believing that the formula is the answer to the running AI projects, Rick wants to see how smart they are by playing a laser tag game with Pinhead and Tunneler. Cameron, who is competing with Rick for success, tries to use the formula's secret for his personal gain, and he and Lauren decide to use a [[Ouija|strange gameboard]] found in the trunk to try and [[Séance|contact]] Toulon for its exact composition, whose recipe was not recorded in the diary. But the glowing pyramid icon which goes with the board is a conduit between the mortal world and the underworld; Sutekh uses the link to send two of his Totems to attack. Cameron and Lauren attempt to flee by car, but Cameron is ambushed by one of the Totems inside his car and killed, while Lauren manages to get back into the hotel. When Rick looks after Cameron, the Totem attacks him as well, but he manages to escape.  But inside the inn, the third Totem, sent in earlier by package, is also on the prowl. The puppets, intent on protecting Rick, search the hotel and soon manage to kill one of the Totems in the kitchen and, through its supervision link, its controller in the underworld. Then Toulon's spirit, who has been appearing around the hotel all night, tells the puppets to animate the Decapitron. Under Rick and Suzie's astonished eyes, the puppets move up to Rick's room, retrieve a box which contains yet another puppet with a soft plastic head, and revive it with the formula and a lightning strike. The two remaining Totems attack to disrupt the process, but one is electrocuted when Six Shooter uses a wire as a [[lasso|lariat]] to divert some of the lightning's power into it. Decapitron briefly awakens, and his head morphs into the likeness of Toulon, who explains to Rick the origin and the secret of the life-giving formula. The vial, however, turns out to be missing; immediately suspecting Cameron, Rick goes back to search his body, where he does find the vial.  Meanwhile, the last Totem corners the panicked Lauren and prepares to drain her life away when Suzie interferes and douses it with [[acid]]. Toulon speaks through Lauren, urging Rick to animate Decapitron to destroy the Totem, and Rick uses his computer to divert power from his generator into Decapitron, bringing him to life. As the Totem attacks, Decapitron exchanges his plastic head for an [[electron]]-bolt launching system and destroys the creature. Afterwards, Toulon speaks to Rick yet again, surrendering custody of his puppets and the formula to him and promising his help in times of need.

  In a [[coffeehouse]], Officer Joe Vickers, a serial killer empowered by [[Satan]], overhears Brian and Larry, a pair [[white-collar worker]]s, discussing a [[bachelor party]] that they are planning to throw in their workplace for their friend Gary. Vickers follows the two to their office, and stakes it out in his car (which is full of body parts and demonic imagery) until after hours, which is when Larry bribes the security guard into letting in three strippers. Vickers tricks the guard into letting him in, then stabs him in the eye with a pencil.  Vickers sabotages the lifts, and when Mike goes downstairs to tell the night watchman about it, Vickers throws him down an elevator shaft. Vickers proceeds to send vaguely threatening [[fax]]es to the partiers, though this does not deter the drunken Gary from going up onto the roof with one of the strippers. The two are found by Vickers, who shoots Gary in the head, and throws the stripper off of the building. Vickers continues to send faxes, prompting Brian, Larry, and the remaining two strippers to go to the copy room, while elsewhere Vickers uses a decorative spear to impale a pair of workers who were having sex in a storage closet.  Larry, Brian, and the strippers flee when Mike and Gary's bodies fall through the ceiling of the copy room, and run into Sharon, an accountant who had stayed late. The [[quintet]] try to call 911, but the lines are not working, and while looking around to see if anyone else is in the building, they find the skewered couple, and are confronted by Vickers.

While the trio make their way up to the garage exit, they are attacked by Vickers, who shoots one stripper, and snaps the neck of the other. Sharon is pursued by Vickers, but manages to set his face on fire (causing one of his sunglasses lenses to melt to his eye) and knock him down an elevator shaft, but he survives the fall.  Sharon makes it out through the garage, and is chased through the streets by Vickers, who catches her outside a bar. The patrons of the bar see Vickers attacking Sharon, and in a parody of the [[Rodney King]] incident, they beat down the officer as a bystander videotapes the scene from his apartment balcony.<ref></ref> Sharon, Brian, and Vickers are all taken to a hospital, where Vickers is healed by demonic forces, massacres the police officers and medical staff watching him, and storms out of his room.

Quest of the Delta Knights
 The plot revolves around a young boy named Travis (nicknamed "Tee") who learns from his master that he is the key to saving the world from an evil plot. Tee joins the secret organization of the Delta Knights and embarks on a quest to attempt to recover the lost treasures inside the fabled Lost Storehouse of [[Archimedes]]. The plot is markedly similar to that of [[Robert Heinlein]]'s [[Citizen of the Galaxy]], including its essentially identical setup of a young slave boy—who is really the lost heir of a powerful family—being bought for a pittance by a seeming beggar, who is himself really a spy, and who suspects the boy's true identity.  
Rain Without Thunder
 Allison Goldring, an upper-class, white college student, becomes pregnant from her boyfriend Jeremy Tanner ([[Steve Zahn]]). After discussing her options with both Tanner and her family, she makes the decision to travel abroad to terminate the pregnancy, as abortion is prosecuted as "fetal murder" in the United States. According to Allison and her mother Beverley, everyone – including Tanner – supported her decision. Tanner later denies this, though the film makes his denial seem improbable. Allison's father and grandmother are interviewed and openly support both Allison and Beverly.  Allison's father says that he originally intended to go along with them and that the choice to prosecute Beverly is arbitrary; ultimately, Beverly is perceived to have a greater influence on Allison.  Later interviews give further background on the society: civil liberties are slowly and methodically curtailed over time in order fight "hypercrime".  In the early twenty-first century, restrictions on warrants are loosened, and several states pass laws criminalizing abortion.  At first, only abortionists are targeted by the laws, and complacent feminists dismiss the idea that the situation will get worse.  When the Roman Catholic Church accepts barrier contraception, feminism becomes further weakened, and a wave of pro-life legislation is passed, culminating in a new amendment to the United States Constitution that defines personhood at conception.  Following that, laws are enacted that target women seeking abortions, and feminism becomes not only politically incorrect but also subject to historical revisionism that denies its impact.  The state of New York has recently passed a law that classifies going abroad to seek a termination as "fetal kidnapping". Beverly admits to being aware of the change but assumed it would be some time before it would be enforced. It is not clear how aware Allison and Jeremy were of the legal change. The law is a reaction to a lawsuit aimed at overturning fetal murder statutes because they are enforced almost exclusively against poor minority women. Examples of such women are interviewed at Walker Point ([[Ming-Na]] and [[Bahni Turpin]]). One had used some [[abortifacient]] called a "baby bomb". She was arrested as she bled out after improperly administering the drug. The other was initially arrested on suspicion of having a termination, but is convicted of using  an IUD, which is also illegal. Her descriptions of how she obtained the "uudee" suggest that she was also in a potentially dangerous medical situation.  African American district attorney Andrea Murdoch ([[Iona Morris]]) discovers what the Goldrings have done and prosecutes them under the new law, in large part because they are exactly the type of women targeted by the law. The criminal procedures show that doctor-patient confidentiality is no longer guaranteed. Murdoch's motivations are questioned by Jonathan Garson ([[Jeff Daniels]]), the Goldrings' attorney, who suggests she is seeking higher office, although he doesn't question her ethics. Murdoch's own statements suggest that she is angered by the racial and class disparities in enforcement, but she does not question the propriety of fetal murder law.  During the trial, Allison decides to take the stand and confesses to what she did. She does not express remorse at the time nor does she express any regret later. She says that she felt relieved to get everything out. Beverly and Garson are frustrated by her decision, since it condemns both Allison and Beverly to prison. At the end of the film, the Swedish clinic checks their pathology reports on Allison and determines that the fetus had been dead for almost three weeks prior to the procedure. The Goldrings are released, but Murdoch declares her intention to prosecute them on attempted fetal kidnapping, on the grounds that they had intended to commit the crime even if they had not been able to commit it.  
The Rainbow Warrior (film)
 The film is based on the true story of the [[Greenpeace]] ship [[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|''Rainbow Warrior'']], which was sunk in [[Waitematā Harbour]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand on 10 July 1985 by French [[Directorate-General for External Security|DGSE]] operatives, when it was preparing for a Pacific voyage to protest [[French nuclear testing]].

When engaged in his night trade, the Rapeman wears a black leather ski mask shaped like the head of a penis, but no trousers or underwear. In the middle of a rape, if the woman becomes unresponsive or expresses enjoyment, he uses special techniques such as "M69 Screwdriver" or "Infinite Loop" to apply more pain to the victim. Despite regretting some of the contracts he fulfills, he always completes the task.  
Rang
  Yogi Joshi ([[Kamal Sadanah]]) is a hardworking middle-class student who goes to college with the traditional Pooja ([[Ayesha Julka]]), who is the daughter of a single father. Pooja has been in love with Yogi for quite some time, but Yogi seems to see her as a good friend. Pooja is very possessive of a particular parking spot in school and does not like anyone parking in that spot.  Yogi's father ([[Bharat Kapoor]]) works at the factory owned by the successful Indu Singh ([[Amrita Singh]]). Indu admits her daughter into the same college as Yogi and Pooja. She is a trustee of the college and is assured by the Principal that Kajal is in good hands. Kajal ([[Divya Bharti]]) goes to college and tries to park in Pooja's spot, but Pooja cuts her off. The two get in an altercation and to show Pooja how much power Kajal has, she drives her jeep into the corridors of the college and stops right in front of Pooja and her friends, including Yogi. Pooja holds her own and is unimpressed. Pooja and Yogi's friend Jojo, who had been run over by Kajal in her rampage, tells his friends that he cut Kajal's brakes. Yogi, feeling responsible for Jojo's actions, runs after Kajal's car. He catches up to her right as her car falls over a cliff into a river. He saves the unconscious Kajal from drowning and brings her home. Indu's mother, the snobby Suchitra ([[Bindu (actress)|Bindu]]) offends Yogi by trying to give him money, but he politely refuses.  That night, Kajal and Yogi dream about each other as they fall in love. The next day, Kajal approaches Yogi and asks if they could be friends.  Yogi points out the difference in their class and status. Specifically, he mentions that Kajal has a car while he only has his feet. So Kajal decides that she won't use a car until Yogi goes on a date with her. Yogi finds out that Kajal is walking home and is worried. He finds her drenched in sweat being followed by her two friends in her car. He decides to go on a date with her to convince her. They go to see the movie, ''[[Bobby (1973 film)|Bobby]]''. They imagine themselves as the characters during the famous song "Hum Tum Ek Kamre Mein Band Ho." During a song sequence, they are shown to be spending a lot of time together and have fallen in love. Suchitra sees the two of them together and is angry.  On Rose Day, Kajal knows that Yogi is waiting for her with a rose so she obsesses on what to wear and is late to college. Pooja sees Yogi holding a rose and waiting for someone. She assumes the rose is for her and takes it from his hands and runs away. She feels that this is a sign that Yogi too loves her.  Meanwhile, Yogi's father is the Union leader and when the factory workers decide to protest against Indu's company, she fires Mr. Joshi. He is helped by chairman Ajay Malhotra ([[Jeetendra]]) who is a hero to factory workers. Ajay Malhotra turns out to be Pooja's father. When he finds out that Pooja is in love with Mr. Joshi's son, he goes to the Joshi residence in the pouring rain to ask for Yogi's hand in marriage for Pooja. Mrs. Joshi ([[Rita Bhaduri]]) knew her son was in love with someone and had assumed it to be Pooja, who had come to her house looking for Yogi.  When Yogi finds out about the proposal, he informs his parents that he is in love with Indu's daughter Kajal. His parents show him that he wants to marry the daughter of the woman who ruined his father, as opposed to the daughter of the man who saved him. So Yogi tries to break it off with Kajal, but he cannot bear to stand by this decision. When Yogi tells Pooja that he is in love with Kajal, Pooja tries to commit suicide. A distraught Ajay goes to Kajal and begs her to save his daughter by breaking up with Yogi.  She responds by telling him that she can't give up her life to save his daughter's life.  Kajal is touched by Ajay's fatherly devotion and thinks of her own father. She asks her grandfather, Madhav Singh ([[Kader Khan]]) about her father. Her grandfather finds an old picture of her father. To her surprise, Ajay Malhotra is her father. Madhav Singh tells Kajal that her father was an activist for workers' rights. Suchitra had never approved of the match as Indu's family was rich and Ajay was a lowly middle-class factory worker. However, the two were in love, so they married and they had a daughter. When Ajay led the Singh factory workers into the strike, Suchitra had instigated the workers against Ajay by making it seem as if he had been bribed to end the strike. He confronted his mother-in-law and asked Indu to choose between her mother and her family. She hesitated as she felt dizzy. Ajay didn't see her being dizzy and thought Indu was choosing her mother, so he angrily took their baby daughter and walked out on their relationship. Indu fainted and found out that she was pregnant again. Suchitra convinced her to raise this child by herself and let Ajay go.  When Kajal realizes that Pooja is her elder sister, she decides to sacrifice her love to save her sister's life by moving to America. This decision leaves Yogi heartbroken, which puts Kajal in a miserable state. Unable to see his granddaughter in pain, Madhav goes to Ajay and informs him that Kajal is his daughter and that he is sacrificing one daughter for another.  Ajay, unaware that he had another daughter, rushes to stop Kajal from going to America. He moves Kajal into her own apartment and spends time with her. He keeps his relationship with Kajal a secret from Pooja as he is waiting for the right time to tell her. Ajay also helps Yogi mend his relationship with Kajal by explaining her situation. The lovers reunite.  Pooja starts suspecting that her father is keeping something from her and follows him one day. She follows him to Kajal's apartment and finds her father spending time with her. She then sees Yogi joining them and her father is supportive of Yogi and Kajal's relationship. Pooja feels betrayed and confronts her father. Her father informs Pooja that Kajal is her younger sister. Kajal again decides to go to America, this time, to get out of the way of Ajay's relationship with Pooja. This time, Pooja stops her and embraces her little sister.  Suchitra finds out that Kajal never reached America and has Yogi arrested for kidnapping. Ajay comes to the rescue and confesses that he has Kajal. The police cannot charge Ajay for taking care of his daughter, so they release Yogi. Indu goes to Kajal and tries to force her to go home, but Kajal refuses. Indu is hurt and walks away. On her way out, Ajay invites Indu to their daughter's wedding. Pooja then goes to see her estranged mother. Pooja confronts Indu for never caring about her. Indu tells her that she never stopped thinking of her elder daughter. Pooja begs Indu to reconcile with her father so that the girls will have both a mother and father, instead of having to choose between the two. Madhav Singh finally stands up to his wife Suchitra to go to Kajal's wedding. Suchitra melts and decides to go to the wedding too.  Ajay tries to contact Indu, but she arrives before he can do that. The two finally reconcile and decide to put their past behind them. The family is finally together.

The Remains of the Day (film)
 In 1958 post-war Britain, Stevens, the [[butler]] of Darlington Hall, receives a letter from Miss Kenton, a recently-divorced former colleague employed as the [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] some twenty years earlier. Lord Darlington has died a broken man, his reputation destroyed after he was exposed as a [[Nazi]] sympathizer, and his stately country manor has been sold to a retired United States [[Congressman]], Mr Jack Lewis. Stevens is granted permission to borrow his [[Daimler Company#Lanchester acquisition and badging|Daimler]], and he sets off to the [[West Country]] to meet Miss Kenton.  The film flashes back to Kenton's arrival as housekeeper in the 1930s. The ever-efficient Stevens managed the household well, taking great pride in his profession, and his dedication was fully displayed when, while his father lay dying, he steadfastly continued his duties. Miss Kenton, too, proved to be a valuable servant, and she was equally efficient and strong-willed, but also warmer and less repressed. Relations between the two eventually warmed, and it became clear she had feelings for him, yet despite their proximity and shared purpose, Stevens's detachment remained unchanged; his first and only loyalty was to his service as Lord Darlington's butler. One time, Miss Kenton embarrassed Stevens by catching him reading a romance novel; Stevens told Miss Kenton he was reading it only to improve his vocabulary.  Meanwhile, Darlington Hall was regularly frequented by politicians of the [[interwar period]], and many of [[Earl of Darlington|Lord Darlington's]] guests were like-minded, [[fascist]]-sympathizing British and European aristocrats, with the exception of the more pragmatic Congressman Lewis, who did not share the "noble instincts" of Lord Darlington and his guests. Lewis informed the "gentleman politicians" in his midst that "Europe has become the arena of [[Realpolitik]]" and warned them they were "headed for disaster."  Darlington later met Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] and the German Ambassador, and used his influence to try to broker a policy of [[appeasement]] towards [[Nazi Germany]], based on his belief that Germany had been unfairly treated by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] following the [[First World War]] and only desires peace. In the midst of these events - and after overhearing Sir Geoffrey Wren praising [[racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial laws]] - Darlington suddenly requested that two newly-appointed [[German-Jewish]] maids, both sisters and refugees, should be dismissed, despite Stevens's mild protest that the sisters were good workers. Nevertheless, Stevens carried out Lord Darlington's command, despite a horrified Miss Kenton threatening to resign in protest. Miss Kenton later confided in Stevens she had no family and nowhere to go to should she leave Darlington Hall, and was ashamed to not follow up on her threat to resign.  Lord Darlington's godson, journalist Reginald Cardinal, was appalled by the nature of the secret meetings in Darlington Hall; concurring with Congressman Lewis' earlier protestations, Cardinal told Stevens that Lord Darlington was a pawn, being used by the Nazis. Despite Cardinal's indignation, Stevens did not denounce or criticise his master. Later, Lord Darlington expressed regret for having dismissed Ilsa and Irma, the two German-Jewish maids. He asked Stevens to locate them and Stevens enquired Miss Kenton as to the maids' whereabouts. (It is revealed the sisters had returned to Germany; their ultimate fate is unknown.)  Eventually, Miss Kenton formed a relationship with a former co-worker, Tom Benn, who proposed marriage and asked Miss Kenton to move away with him to run a coastal boarding house. Miss Kenton mentioned this proposal to Stevens, in effect offering him an ultimatum, but Stevens would not admit his feelings, offering Miss Kenton only his congratulations. Miss Kenton left Darlington Hall prior to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]]. Before Miss Kenton's departure, Stevens found her crying in frustration, but the only response he could muster was to call her attention to a neglected domestic task.  En route to meeting Miss Kenton in 1958, when asked by locals about his former employer, Stevens at first denies having served or even met Lord Darlington, but later admits to having served and respected him. He meets Miss Kenton (now Mrs Benn), and they reminisce. Stevens mentions in conversation that Lord Darlington's godson, Reginald Cardinal, was killed in the war. He also says Lord Darlington died from a broken heart - after the war, Lord Darlington sued a newspaper for [[libel]], losing the suit and his reputation in the process. Stevens reveals that in his declining years, Lord Darlington at times failed to recognise Stevens and carried on conversations with no one else in the room.  Miss Kenton declines Stevens's offer to return to Darlington Hall, wishing instead to remain near her pregnant daughter. After the meeting, Miss Kenton is emotional, while Stevens is still unable to demonstrate any feeling. Back in Darlington Hall, Lewis asks Stevens if he remembers much of the old days, to which Stevens replies that he was too busy serving. A pigeon then becomes trapped in the hall, and is eventually freed by the two men, leaving both Stevens and Darlington Hall far behind.  
Red Rock West
 Michael Williams ([[Nicolas Cage]]) is a drifter living out of his car after being discharged from the Marine Corps. A job on an oilfield falls through due to his unwillingness to conceal a war injury on his job application, so Michael wanders into rural Red Rock, [[Wyoming]], looking for other work. A local bar owner named Wayne ([[J. T. Walsh]]) mistakes him for a hit man, "Lyle from Dallas", whom Wayne has hired to kill his wife. Wayne offers him a stack of cash—"half now, half later"—and Michael plays along by taking the money.  Michael visits Wayne's wife, Suzanne ([[Lara Flynn Boyle]]) and attempts to warn her that her life is in danger instead of killing her. She offers him more money to kill Wayne. Michael tries to leave town but a car accident leads him to encounter the local sheriff, who turns out to be Wayne. Michael manages to escape from Wayne but runs into the real Lyle from Dallas ([[Dennis Hopper]]). Lyle and Wayne quickly figure out what has transpired, while Michael desperately tries to warn Suzanne before Lyle finds her.  The next morning, when Lyle comes to get money from Wayne, he kidnaps both Suzanne and Michael, who are trying to retrieve hidden cash from Wayne's office. Wayne and Suzanne are revealed to be wanted for embezzlement and Wayne is arrested by his own deputies. Lyle returns with Michael and Suzanne hostage and gets Wayne out of jail to retrieve their stash of money. At a remote graveyard, Wayne pulls a gun from the case of money and holds Lyle at gunpoint before Lyle throws a knife into Wayne's neck. Michael and Lyle fight, with Lyle ending up being impaled on a grave marker. When Lyle rises to attack Michael, Suzanne shoots him dead.  Michael and Suzanne escape onto a nearby train, but when Suzanne tries to betray Michael, he throws the money out of the speeding train and then throws Suzanne off to be arrested by the police accompanied by a wounded Wayne. Michael's train continues its journey into a new town.

Rigoletto (film)
   Rigoletto stars [[Joseph Paur]] as Ari Ribaldi and [[Ivey Lloyd]] as Bonnie Nelson, a singer.  Bonnie reads a part of [[Rigoletto]] each night to her younger brother.   The film time shifts to the 1930s, during America's [[Great Depression]]. The following scene shows an old house which newcomer Mr. Ribaldi purchases.  The next day, Bonnie performs in a singing contest. While Bonnie does not win, she manages to attract the attention of a mysterious man. He says nothing to her and only nods and leaves.  That night as the children walk home, they spot the old house which has been renovated. The townspeople also spot the house and think it is unusual for a house to be renovated so fast.  The same moment, the town banker sells the mortgage on one of his houses and the Nelson family are evicted. Bonnie's mother immediately leaves to locate the person who bought their house. She knocks on the door  only to find the same man who was watching Bonnie's contest: Hans the Butler. He is tense, but welcomes Mrs. Nelson inside and shows her to The Master of the home (Mr. Ribaldi), when she is sternly instructed to stop at the rug. The man remains seated in the darkness.  He answers to Mrs. Nelson's demands by returning their home directly to them in exchange for an agreement in which Bonnie would "work" for him. Mrs. Nelson asks why she can't do the job instead of her daughter. He evades the question which alarms Mrs. Nelson. She refuses, which enrages Ribaldi and he has her thrown out of the mansion, but not before she catches a glimpse of Ribaldi's scarred face.  Later, she tells Bonnie the bad news but Bonnie asks her permission to accept the job. Mrs. Nelson reluctantly agrees and sends Bonnie to the mansion. For the moment, her only chores are to assist Hans.  He informs Bonnie that she is free to go into any room in the house, except for the master suite, though he has to resort to bribery to keep from explaining why. However, she walks into the forbidden area once she hears a woman taking singing lessons from Mr. Ribaldi. He angrily grabs Bonnie but the woman (Gabriella) sends him away "to pout".  Meanwhile, many in the town are risking foreclosure as a result of the Depression and suspect the mysterious Ribaldi, who initially did the very same thing to The Nelsons.  The people in town also begin receiving unknown sources of financial assistance. Some receive checks to pay for expensive medical procedures to heal crippling illnesses and others find employment. The townspeople suspect nothing of any of this.   The children become curious and decide to prowl the mansion late at night. Their pranks are halted when the "bloodsucker" abducts a young girl who had walked with a limp. A riot occurs over the missing child, who reappears unharmed (and with no limp.)  Trouble still plagues the citizens who place the blame on Ribaldi and his apparent antisocial behavior. They manage to disqualify Bonnie from the competition unless she stops visiting him. She refuses but Ribaldi insists she goes and casts her out of the mansion. However, both Ribaldi and Hans are astonished at her choice.  Hans takes Bonnie to the competition at the state capital and prepares to sing a song written by Ribaldi.  Georgie walks into the mansion and finds Ribaldi by himself. She asks for singing lessons, but Ribaldi says it is not a good day. He offers to take her part of the way home but Georgie insists on taking a dangerous shortcut near a [[Hydroelectricity|hyrdoelectric dam]]. She slips by a torrent and falls in the water.  The film returns to the competition, and it is now Bonnie's turn to sing.  Later, Mr. Ribaldi has an unconscious Georgie in his arms as he limps into town to find help. The townspeople think he caused her injury and so attack him. The town banker manages to stop the attack, but not before Ribaldi is badly battered. They proceed to the mansion in search of his bank book, leaving behind Ribaldi, Mrs. Nelson, and a few bystanders.  The film cuts to Bonnie, who finishes singing. She receives a standing ovation and first place.    In the next scene, the angry mob breaks into the completely empty house, trashing it, only leaving once they find the bank book, to their delight. Upon reading it, however, they are shocked, disappointed, and saddened. The only transactions they find show that he has paid their medical bills.  The banker then admits to increasing their house payments, and the mob leaves in disgust. The banker and his son take Mr. Ribaldi to the hospital.  Bonnie and Hans return only to find that Mr. Ribaldi died a few hours before. They hold a funeral. Afterward, Hans says that he is returning home to a "former employer".  After Hans departs, some of the people walk past the mansion. They hear familiar piano music. Bonnie walks in to discover a man who resembles Ribaldi, but with no scars. The man seems to have no knowledge of previous events, but then returns something Porter has left behind, despite them apparently having never met before.  Hans and Gabriella appear, and Bonnie asks for the man's name. He says, "Some people call me Rigoletto. But you probably don't believe that, do you?"  The movie ends with Bonnie reading the final lines of the story ''Rigoletto'', and her brother asks, "Do you believe that, Bonnie?" "I do," she replies, and the film ends on a close-up of the book.  
Remote (1993 film)
 Randy Mason (Chris Carrara) is a teenage tech whiz who lives in a suburban neighborhood located somewhere in the state of California with his mother Marti ([[Derya Ruggles]]), who creates designs for an ad agency and his father Brent (who's away for the duration of the film on a business trip). Randy designs and uses remote controlled models as a hobby, as well as using the modified controllers for other purposes as well. Among them is a helicopter named Huey, a double-winged plane, a WWII fighter plane called Zero, red and blue racecars, a green monster truck, a Godzilla knockoff and a yodeling mountain climber named Gunther. He shares the hobby with his good friend and love interest Judy Riley (Jessica Bowman), an avid baseball player and shows her the local model home which serves as his secret hideout.  After Randy pulls a prank on a bully across the street named Ben ([[Jordan Belfi]]) by using one of his remotes to mess with his TV control and then uses the helicopter to drop an empty Coke can on Ben's head (which Ben threw in his yard in the first place), Ben steals Randy's fighter plane. Randy reluctantly lets him take it, but tells him the controller is locked by at night with the others, so Ben insists he bring it to school the next day to give to him. Randy does, but brings his own controller to try to take it back from Ben when he's using it, but the dueling controllers result in the plane accidentally flying into the classroom where Randy's science class is and after causing chaos among the students, crashes into the project of his friend Jamaal ([[Kenneth A. Brown]]).  Getting the blame for it because no one saw Ben, Randy is expelled from the school and arrives home to hear Marti saying on the answering machine (she was stressed and too upset to think at the moment) that she heard about what happened and is going to confiscate all of his models. Randy then decides to hide them at the model home until Marti calms down. Judy suggests the best thing to do is tell the truth about Ben, but Randy also feels responsible for what happened and doesn't further wish to incur Ben's wrath. Judy helps him under protest and she reminds Randy of her baseball game that night. Despite having forgotten about it, he says he'll be there.  As Randy is leaving later, he stumbles across three store robbers named Delbert McCoy (John Diehl), Louis ([[Tony Longo]]), and Louis' cousin Richie Marinelli ([[Stuart Fratkin]]). The three robbers (having robbed a convenience store, but left the money behind by accident) decide to break into and hide at the model home until the road blocks the cops set up for them are cleared away in 3-4 days. The ill-tempered Delbert (embarrassed by his real name and insistent on being called Del) has a gun which is why they have been labeled on the news as armed and dangerous. They unwittingly trap Randy in the attic when he hides from them not knowing he's there by taking the ladder to the window away after he's climbed up. The robbers use the ladder and packs of cigarettes in order to create a path on the carpet that keeps them from walking on the alarm sensor pads.  Randy attempts to use his helicopter to contact the eccentric real estate agent Mrs. Williams ([[Lorna Scott]]) who's driving by in her car with a written message, but she doesn't see it and eventually, the helicopter can't keep up with the car. Randy also tries to trip the burglars up by using Gunther to put a tack in Richie's shoe, but he and Louis just barely avoid stepping on the alarm pads. Randy attempts to steal the gun, but it proves too heavy for Gunther to lift. Getting hungry, Randy uses Gunther to steal Louis' sirloin steak and then when attempting to steal the can of baked beans, Randy runs into the same problem he did with the gun earlier and is forced to drop the can on Richie's head, which he believes Louis did.  At her game, Judy gets worried about Randy not being there and calls his house and leaves a message. Marti hears the message when she comes home from work and not having any idea where Randy is, calls the police. When Marti tells Ben and his mother about Randy disappearing, Ben accidentally reveals a bit more than he should have known, to which his mother (hinted at being emotionally and possibly physically abusive) declares to Marti that she'll figure out if her son knows more than he's letting on and drags him away. After using his bag straps to try climbing out the window and failing, Randy falls asleep at about the same time as the crooks. Marti stays by the phone that night and falls asleep on the couch. Judy and her family get home late from the game and go straight to sleep, not noticing that Marti called earlier and left a message on the machine.  The next morning when Judy gets up, she notices the message and listens to it. After calling Marti and hearing how worried she is, Judy then sets out on her own to find Randy. Louis looks out the window and sees her coming towards the model home and alerts Delbert and Richie. Randy sees her coming too and when the crooks take Judy hostage, Randy proceeds to use the remote controlled toys against them to prevent them from escaping and to rescue Judy. After Louis breaks into the attic using a knife to pick the lock, Randy uses the Godzilla model to melt roofing tar in a bucket and dump it on Louis' head, causing Louis to fall onto the carpet that sets off the alarm. Randy then uses the helicopter to sic Mrs. Williams' bulldog Bluto on Richie and then uses the airplane to tie Richie up with a flag line.  Randy disarms Delbert using Gunther and Judy picks up his gun and throws it away. Delbert angrily makes his way towards Judy, but Randy gets Delbert to step on each of the racecars and uses them as remote controlled roller skates to lead him away. Delbert ends up crashing into rocks and is thrown through the air into a cardboard sign for the real estate company. The police arrive and arrest Louis and Richie (and presumably Delbert as well), Randy is reunited with Marti and Jamaal and Mrs. Williams with Bluto (who ran away from her). Randy and Judy quietly agree to find a new secret hideout and the film ends as Randy lures the yodeling Gunther down from the top of the roof.  
The Return of the Borrowers
 Once again the Clock Family (a teenage girl named Arriety and her parents, Pod and Homily), tiny "borrowers" who live in a cottage of regular sized human beings, are forced to find a new place to live when they learn of the upcoming departure of the humans in whose house they reside. Hendreary, Lupy, Eggletina remain behind at the cottage. With the help of their friend Spiller, Arreitty, Pod and Homily escape through the house drain system and temporarily move to a [[kettle]] Spiller has looked after. Spiller tells the Clock family about a [[model village]] called Little Fordham which is down the stream. Pod and Arrietty go back to the Manor where George provides them with a "boat" (which is actually a large cutlery holder with a pin for an anchor and a knife for steering).  Meanwhile, Pod's nephews Ditchley and Ilrick trap Pod and Homily in the kettle as a joke by jamming the lid on with a stick, then leave. A storm comes and the kettle is swept down the stream. A rock knocks the stick off the lid and Pod and Homily manage to get out of the kettle before it hits a large stick suspended across two rocks. The next morning, Spiller and Arrietty find the kettle sunk near the bank just as Ditchley and Ilrick arrive, realizing their joke went too far. Pod and Homily arrive and Pod interrogates Ditchley and Ilrick for their actions and scares them off. The Clock family sail down the stream overnight and are nearly caught by Mild Eye, who is stopped by a Police Officer who presumably arrests him. The Borrowers arrive in Little Fordham where they try to live in secret.  A relative of George's called Ms. Menzies arrives at the manor and explains to Mrs. Driver that George sent a letter to his parents saying that he wasn't happy at the manor. Ms. Menzies then explains it would be better if George were to spend his Summer Holidays with her instead. Mrs. Driver is more than happy to accept it and George leaves with Ms. Menzies to stay in a place called Fordham, which is like Little Fordham but bigger. Arrietty befriends Miss Menzies and also meets George, but unknown to Clocks, the owner of Little Fordham, Mr. Pott, sees two of them while attending to the model buildings.  The Borrowers are eventually discovered by a couple who own a rival model village and are kidnapped with the intention of being put on [[Tourist attraction|attraction]] when that model village opens for [[tourist]] season. Imprisoned in the couple's attic, the Clocks are able to use materials they find to create a hot-air [[balloon]] and basket which lifts them out of a window to freedom moments before they are to be put on display.  Knowing they cannot risk moving back into Little Fordham, the family again take to the great outdoors, in search of a new place to call home. Spiller tells the Clocks that there's an old [[watermill]], one human and plenty to eat down the stream. Arrietty writes a letter to George explaining that they are leaving Little Fordham, and thanking him, Ms. Menzies and Mr. Pott for everything. The series ends with the Borrowers sailing down the stream, and Pod says that whatever happens, there's always some way to manage.  
Rich in Love
 The Odom family lives in a large, white, Southern house in [[Mount Pleasant, South Carolina]], just off Pitt Street, looking out onto [[Charleston Harbor]].  Lucille Odom (Erbe) is nearing the end of her last year of high school when her mother, Helen Odom (Clayburgh), leaves the family, breaking all ties.  Lucille is left to care for her recently retired father, Warren Odom (Finney).   The family spends the summer trying to get their lives together, which is complicated when the older daughter of the family, Rae (Amis), moves back home with a new husband (MacLachlan) and a new baby on the way, about which Rae has mixed feelings.  While reminiscing about their mother, Rae tells Lucille that their mother tried to abort Lucille when she was pregnant. Warren notices his daughters in a new and different way now that his wife is gone and he is no longer working.  Everything changes for Lucille as she comes-of-age and learns about her family in new ways.  
Return of the Living Dead 3
 Curt Reynolds steals his father's security [[key card]], and he and his girlfriend, Julie, explore the military base where his father works. They observe Curt's father, Colonel John Reynolds, Col. Peck and Lt. Col. Sinclair overseeing an experiment with a deceased body.   The corpse is exposed to 2-4-5 Trioxin gas, which re-animates the corpse into a [[zombie]]. The military hopes to use zombies in combat. However, they are impossible to control as their hunger for human brains causes them to constantly attack.  To deter the zombies' vicious nature, Sinclair suggests permanently attaching the zombies to [[Powered exoskeleton|exoskeletons]] that will immobilize them when they are not in battle. Reynolds prefers a method referred to as "paretic infusion", which involves firing a chemical projectile into the forehead of the zombie. This causes an [[Endothermic process|endothermic]] reaction, freezing the zombie's brain and temporarily immobilizing it.  When the paretic infusion method is tested on the zombie in the lab, it is only successful for a few moments, wearing off much faster than expected; the zombie breaks free and attacks a scientist, biting his fingers off before bashing his head against a wall, killing him. Infected by the zombie's bite, the scientist re-animates and attacks another technician. The initial zombie and the reanimated scientist are paralyzed with bullets and the survivors in the room are quarantined. Reynolds is removed from the project and reassigned to Oklahoma City, while Sinclair is promoted to head of the project.  Reynolds informs Curt that they will be moving, something they have done multiple times, but Curt refuses. He rides off on his motorcycle with Julie. While they are speeding down the road, Julie playfully grabs Curt's crotch, causing him to lose control of the motorcycle. Julie is thrown from the bike into a telephone pole; the impact kills her.  Curt brings Julie's corpse to the military base. Using his father's key card, he accesses the Trioxin gas to reanimate her. This leads to Julie and Curt dealing with the effects of Julie being dead - not feeling pain and having no desire to eat normal food - and what they are to do about her condition.  Julie becomes hungry and Curt drives them to a store. A gang talk about her as she is eating snacks on the floor. Curt becomes angry and accidentally hits one of them. During the ensuing brawl one of the gang shoots the shopkeeper. Julie bites the shooter. The alarm goes off and the gang flees. While Curt and Julie are in a van with the wounded shopkeeper, Julie is overcome by her hunger for brains and attacks him, eating some of his brains before Curt stops her.  The gang chases Julie and Curt through the city, not realizing what is happening to their infected friend. Julie and Curt hide from the gang in the sewers, where they encounter Riverman, a vagrant who shelters them. Julie discovers that extreme pain seems to temporarily make the cravings to feed on humans go away. She mutilates her flesh with various items of junk found around Riverman's lair, until she is adorned with spikes, nails, and shards of glass sticking out of her flesh.  The gang tracks Julie and Curt down. Julie seduces the gang leader, then kills him and uses her new decorations to kill the rest of the gang. Julie's body becomes accustomed to the pain, and she turns on Riverman, infecting and killing him. The gang re-animates before the military arrive and neutralizes all of the zombies.  When the zombies are captured, Curt realizes Julie is going to be used as a weapon and goes into a rage, freeing the zombies which then kill the soldiers. In the commotion the base is set on fire and Curt is bitten. Curt's father tries to get Curt to leave but he realizes that he would be abandoning Julie, and also knows he is infected. Curt brings Julie to the furnace; when she asks where they are, Curt says "where we belong", and they kiss one last time before dying by [[Self-immolation|immolation]].  
Robin Hood: Men in Tights
 Robin of Locksley ([[Cary Elwes]]) is captured during the [[Crusades]] and is imprisoned at Khalil Prison in [[Jerusalem]]. With the help of fellow inmate Asneeze ([[Isaac Hayes]]), who was arrested for [[jaywalking]], he escapes and frees the other inmates. Robin is asked by Asneeze to find his son, Ahchoo ([[Dave Chappelle]], in his first major professional role). Upon returning to England, he finds Ahchoo and discovers that Prince John ([[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]]) has assumed control while King Richard is away fighting in the Crusades. Unbeknownst to Richard, the prince is abusing his power. Robin returns to his family home, Loxley Hall, only to find it being repossessed by John's men. His family's blind servant, Blinkin ([[Mark Blankfield]]), informs Robin that his family members and pets have all died as well, and the only thing his father left him is a key which opens "the greatest treasure in all the land."  Robin recruits the large and ignorant Little John ([[Eric Allan Kramer]]), and his friend Will Scarlet O'Hara ([[Matthew Porretta]]), to help regain his father's land and oust Prince John from the throne. On his quest, Robin also attracts the attention of Maid Marian ([[Amy Yasbeck]]) of Bagelle, who wants to find the man who has the key to her heart (and [[Everlast (boxing)|Everlast]] [[chastity belt]]). They are also joined by Rabbi Tuckman ([[Mel Brooks]]), who shares with them his sacramental wine and bargain [[circumcisions]]. While Robin is training his band of tights-clad [[Merry Men]], the [[spoonerism]]-spouting Sheriff of Rottingham ([[Roger Rees]]), hires the Mafioso [[Vito Corleone|Don Giovanni]] ([[Dom DeLuise]], parodying [[Marlon Brando]]'s performance of [[Vito Corleone]] in ''[[The Godfather]]'') to assassinate Robin at the Spring Festival (with archery tournament), spoofing a similarly outlandish plot twist from the [[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves|Costner movie]] involving Scottish mercenaries. The archer who will carry out the assassination is a parody of [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[Man with No Name]]'' character. Maid Marian hears of the evil plot, and sneaks out of her castle to warn Robin, accompanied by her frumpy [[Germany|German]] Lady-in-Waiting Broomhilde ([[Megan Cavanagh]]). The Sheriff and Don expect that Robin will not refuse a chance to participate in the archery tournament due to his pride, and Robin does just that.  At the archery tournament, a disguised Robin makes it to the final round, where he makes his shot but loses to his opponent. Robin calls this situation absurd, takes off his disguise and pulls out a copy of the movie's script to discover that he gets another shot. The Sheriff and Prince John then pull out their own copies and confirm this (much to their annoyance). Giovanni's assassin attempts to kill Robin by shooting at him with a scoped crossbow, but Blinkin catches the arrow in midair. Robin then takes the second shot, this time using a special "[[MIM-104 Patriot|PATRIOT]] arrow" and hits the target. After winning the tournament, Robin is arrested. Before Robin is taken away, Marian promises to do the most disgusting thing she can think of in exchange for Robin's safety: marry the Sheriff.  Several hours later, the ceremony commences with the opening prayer in "The New Latin" ([[Pig Latin]]). The Abbot ([[Dick Van Patten]]) quickly and discreetly reveals the Sheriff's unimposing first name, Mervyn. Before Marian can say "I do", the castle is attacked by the Men in Tights, led by Little John, Ahchoo, Blinkin, and Will. They quickly free Robin and a battle ensues. Marian is carried off to the tower by the Sheriff, who wants to [[deflower]] her but cannot get around the chastity belt without some uncomfortable chafing.  Robin arrives and begins to duel the sheriff, during which Robin's key falls into the lock of Marian's chastity belt, and Robin realises it really is the key to "the greatest treasure in all the land." After winning the fight Robin spares the sheriff's life only to miss his sheath and accidentally run the sheriff through. The witch Latrine ([[Tracey Ullman]]), Prince John's full-time cook and part-time adviser, saves him by giving him a magical [[Life Savers|lifesaver]] in exchange for agreeing to marry her. Before Robin and Marian can "celebrate" in her bedroom, Broomhilde arrives, insisting they get married first. Rabbi Tuckman conducts the ceremony, but they are suddenly interrupted by [[Richard I of England|King Richard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]), recently returned from the Crusades, who insists on sanctioning the marriage with a kiss to the new bride. He orders John to be taken away to the [[Tower of London]] and made part of the tour. He also announces that, as the Prince has surrounded his given name with a foul stench, all the [[toilet]]s in the kingdom are to be renamed "johns".  All being as it should be, Robin and Marian are married and Ahchoo is made the new sheriff of Rottingham. When the crowd expresses its disbelief at a black sheriff, Ahchoo reminds them that "it worked in ''[[Blazing Saddles]]''". When the night comes, Robin and Maid Marian attempt to open the [[chastity belt]] only to realise her lock will not open with his key (to her fury and dismay). The film ends with Robin calling for a [[locksmith]].  
Rookie of the Year (film)
  Henry Rowengartner (Nicholas), 12-year-old [[Little League Baseball|Little League]]r, has dreams of playing in the major leagues, although he is not very skilled. One day, Henry breaks his arm trying to catch a fly ball (he slips on another ball that is lying on the ground) and has to wrap it in a cast. Once the arm is healed, the doctor removes the cast and discovers Henry's tendons have healed "a little too tight," thus enabling Henry to cock his arm back and fire it forward with incredible force.  A fateful trip to [[Wrigley Field]] for a [[Chicago Cubs]] game results in Henry's friends getting a home run ball hit by the visiting team, the [[Montreal Expos]]. However, when they give it to Henry to throw back onto the field (per Wrigley tradition), his tightly-healed arm throws the ball so hard that it reaches home plate on the fly. Looking for a miracle to save the club, which is suffering slumping attendance, general manager Larry Fisher (Hedaya) begins efforts to get Henry to join the Cubs. Manager Sal Martinella visits Henry at home to scout him, bringing a radar gun, and discovers that Henry now has the ability to regularly pitch at over 100 miles per hour.  For the remainder of the season, Henry has to juggle the culture shock of actually playing in the major leagues—working with one of his heroes, aging pitcher Chet "Rocket" Steadman (Busey) and spending time with his friends. Under it all, his mother, Mary (Amy Morton), tries to keep him grounded while resisting attempts by Fisher and her boyfriend, Jack (Altman), to exploit his newfound fame.  Henry's first game is a relief appearance against the [[New York Mets]], in which he gives up a home run to the Mets' feared slugger Heddo (Tom Milanovich), an arrogant player who taunts him while at the plate and rounding the bases. Despite wanting to quit after the game, he then shows marked improvement under the tutoring of Steadman, and records a second consecutive save against the [[San Francisco Giants]] capped off with his first MLB strikeout.  Continuing to impress leading into and during a road game against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], Henry bats for the first time, and his extremely small stature (and subsequent extremely small strike zone) frustrates the Dodger pitcher to the point where he walks on four straight pitches. He subsequently scores a run, followed by an adult player who scores behind him (they are limited by Henry's speed, as baseball rules dictate that a trailing runner cannot overtake another runner in front or they will be called out.)  During the course of the season, relationships begin to get strained, as Henry gets into a fight with his friends who have grown increasingly jealous of his star status, and Mary breaks up with Jack over a supposed endorsement deal that was actually a free-agent contract unknowingly signed by Mary to join the [[New York Yankees]] the next season. Eventually, Henry resolves the conflict with his friends, and when he asks team owner Bob Carson (Bracken) about the contract with the Yankees, Carson explains that he never authorized such a deal, and that he wants to retain Henry's services. At this point, Henry tells Carson that he will retire at the end of the season. Carson is at first disappointed but respects Henry's decision, wishing him the best of luck and then demotes Fisher to Hot Dog Salesman after finding out that Fisher tried to set up the deal.  On the last day of the season, presumably the deciding game for the [[National League]] [[National_League_East#Former_members|Eastern Division]] seat, the Cubs face the Mets once again at Wrigley Field, with Steadman starting. At first, Steadman pitches well, but then by the 6th inning, feels pain in his arm each time he throws, eventually allowing the Mets to load the bases. However, he makes one final play, and despite damaging his arm, managed to tag a runner out at home, and subsequently turns the ball over to Henry. As before, Henry easily strikes out the side in the seventh and eighth innings, but in the top of the ninth, he slips on a baseball and lands on his side, reversing the effects of his first fall and reducing his arm strength to normal again.  Henry frustrates the Cubs and their fans by refusing to throw pitches that his catcher signals for, and only throws once the catcher stands up, setting up an intentional walk. He then brings in the disappointed Cubs players, explaining why he can no longer throw fastballs, and sends them back to their positions with a plan he came up with. With their cooperation, [[hidden ball trick|Henry sneaks the ball to the first baseman]], who subsequently tags the runner out. Henry then issues an intentional walk to the next batter, with whom he trades insults. When the runner dares him to throw the ball high, Henry starts to do so, but stops as the runner takes off for second. He is tagged out as well, setting up a final showdown with Heddo, who had hit the home run in Henry's debut and gloats as he recalls that moment. Henry has an idea and throws a changeup, which Heddo swings at and misses. Heddo hits the next pitch down the left-field line and into the bleachers, but it is ruled a foul ball; this angers Heddo, who tells Henry that he "has nothing". Henry opens his glove to find not his father's name, but Mary's. He looks to her in the stands and she confirms that she was the ballplayer who was his parent. She then signals him to throw a floater, an unusual pitch that rises very high in the air. He does so, and strikes out a shocked Heddo to win the pennant for the Cubs.  The next spring, Henry is playing Little League baseball again, with Steadman and Mary as the coaches of his team. After catching a home run ball that ensures victory, while celebrating with his teammates, raises his fist to the camera and reveals he is wearing a Cubs World Series championship ring, signifying he helped the Cubs win the World Series (even though he did not pitch in it).  
Rising Sun (film)
 During a commencement gala at the newly opened Los Angeles headquarters of Nakamoto, a Japanese [[keiretsu]], a [[call girl]] named Cheryl Lynn Austin, is found dead, apparently after a violent sexual encounter. Police Detectives Web Smith and John Connor, a former police captain and expert on Japanese affairs, are sent to act as liaison between the Japanese executives and the investigating officer, Smith's former partner Tom Graham. During the initial investigation, Connor and Smith review surveillance camera footage, and realize that one of the discs is missing.  Smith and Connor suspect Eddie Sakamura, Cheryl's [[yakuza]] boyfriend, of killing her, and interrogate him at a house party. Sakamura promises to bring Connor something, and Connor reluctantly lets him go after confiscating his passport. Ishihara, a Nakamoto employee whom Connor had previously interrogated, delivers the missing disc, which clearly shows Sakamura killing Cheryl. Graham and Smith lead a SWAT raid on Sakamura's house. He tries to flee in a sports car, but crashes and is killed.  Smith learns that Sakamura had attempted to contact him about the missing disc, so he and Connor take the disc to an expert, Jingo Asakuma, who reveals that the disc has been digitally altered to implicate Sakamura.   Nakamoto is in the midst of sensitive negotiations for the acquisition of an American semiconductor company, with Senator John Morton, a guest at the party, abruptly changing his stance on a bill that would prevent the merger from going through. Suspecting his sudden shift is somehow related to the murder, Connor and Smith attempt to interview him at his campaign office, but without success. Upon returning to Smith's apartment, the duo find Sakamura alive and well. He reveals that he was being tailed that day by Tanaka, a Nakamoto security agent attempting to locate the original disc. Not wanting to be seen with Sakamura, Tanaka stole his sports car and committed suicide by crashing it. Sakamura gives Connor the original disc, but before he can leave, Lt. Graham arrives with Ishihara. Sakamura is killed fighting off Ishihara's men, and Smith is shot and left for dead, surviving only thanks to a bulletproof vest.  After being interrogated, Smith is put on paid leave due to an ongoing investigation of an earlier corruption charge. Regrouping with Connor and Jingo, the three view the original surveillance footage, which shows Senator Morton performing [[erotic asphyxiation]] on Cheryl. Falsely believing he killed her, Morton changes his position on the regulation bill to stay in Nakamoto's good graces. After leaving the boardroom, the footage shows another figure approaching and killing Cheryl by strangulation.  Hoping to draw the killer out, Connor and Smith fax Morton stills of the footage showing his involvement in the murder. Morton contacts Ishihara, revealing the executive to be in on the cover-up, and then Morton commits suicide. Connor, Smith, and Jingo interrupt the merger negotiations to show Nakamoto President Yoshida the surveillance footage. Bob Richmond, an American lawyer working for Nakamoto, reveals himself as the killer and tries to run away, only to be killed by Sakamura's friends.  Yoshida maintains his and his colleagues innocence, quietly exiling Ishihara to a desk job back in Japan. Smith drives Jingo home, where she casts doubt on whether Richmond was really the murderer, or if he was simply taking the fall to protect someone higher up in the company.  
RoboCop 3
 OCP is on the verge of [[bankruptcy]] after a series of failed business plans and drop of stocks, and are now struggling with their plans to create the new Delta City. To speed up the process, OCP creates an armed force called the Urban Rehabilitators, nicknamed "Rehabs," under the command of Paul McDaggett ([[John Castle]]). Ostensibly its purpose is to combat rising crime in Old Detroit, augmenting the ranks of the [[Detroit Police Department]] in apprehending violent criminals. In reality, it has been set up to forcibly relocate the residents of Cadillac Heights. Nikko, a Japanese-American computer whiz kid, loses her parents in the process.  The police force is gradually superseded by the Rehabs, and violent crime begins to spiral out of control. The Delta City dream of the former OCP [[CEO]], "Old Man", lives on with the help of the Japanese Kanemitsu Corporation, which has bought a controlling stake in OCP and is trying to finance the plan. Kanemitsu ([[Mako Iwamatsu|Mako]]), Chairman of the Kanemitsu Corporation, sees the potential in the citywide redevelopment, and moves forward with the plans to remove the current citizens in order to create Delta City. The company develops and uses its own [[ninja]] androids called "Otomo" ([[Bruce Locke]]) to help McDaggett and the new OCP president ([[Rip Torn]]) overcome the resistance of anti-OCP militia forces.  RoboCop (Burke) and partner Anne Lewis (Allen) try to defend civilians from the Rehabs one night, but Lewis is killed by McDaggett. Unable to fight back because of his "Fourth Directive", members of a resistance movement composed of Nikko and residents from Cadillac Heights save RoboCop and he joins them. Due to damage sustained in the shoot-out, RoboCop's systems efficiency plummets, and he asks the resistance to summon Dr. Marie Lazarus ([[Jill Hennessy]]), one of the scientists who created him. Upon arrival she begins to treat RoboCop, deleting the Fourth Directive in the process.  After recovering from his injuries, RoboCop conducts a one-man campaign against the Rehabs and OCP. He finds McDaggett and attempts to subdue him, but McDaggett escapes. McDaggett then learns the location of the resistance fighters' base from a disgruntled resistance member named Coontz ([[Stephen Root]]). The Rehabs attack and most of the resistance members are either killed or taken prisoner. RoboCop returns to the rebel base to find it abandoned. One Otomo unit arrives and attacks him. RoboCop experiences another power drain and his left arm and auto gun is destroyed, but eventually he overcomes his opponent with his arm-mounted gun. Nikko infiltrates the OCP building and assists a captured Lazarus in broadcasting an improvised video, revealing OCP's responsibility for the criminality in the city and implicating them in the removal and killing of the Cadillac Heights residents. The broadcast causes OCP's stock to plunge, driving the company into financial ruin and bankruptcy.  McDaggett decides to execute an all-out strike against Cadillac Heights with the help of the Detroit police, but the police officers, enraged at the company's sadistic ways, refuse to comply and instead defect to the resistance in order to get revenge for Lewis and their salaries and pensions. The rebellion against OCP escalates into a full-scale city war. As a result, McDaggett turns to hiring street gangs and hooligans to assist with his plans.  Having heard Lazarus' broadcast, RoboCop provides aerial support for the entrenched resistance forces, using a [[jet pack]] prototype the resistance had stolen during an earlier raid on an armory. He then proceeds to the OCP building and confronts the waiting McDaggett. RoboCop is then attacked, and nearly defeated, by two Otomo robots. Nikko and Lazarus succeed in reprogramming them using a wireless link from a laptop computer forcing them to attack each other. The Otomos' self-destruct system activates, forcing RoboCop to flee with Nikko and Lazarus. The flaming discharge from the jet-pack immobilizes McDaggett, leaving him to perish in the blast.  As Old Detroit is being cleaned up, Kanemitsu arrives on the scene. He fires the OCP president and orders the shutdown of OCP and cancellation of its Detroit operations, before finally bowing to RoboCop and his group in deference.  
Romeo Is Bleeding
 Jack Grimaldi, a corrupt cop who does favors for the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] in exchange for large fees, has a loving wife, Natalie, and an adoring mistress, Sheri. He thinks he has it all, until both the cops and mob are outwitted by a psychopathic Russian female mob assassin, Mona Demarkov.  Italian crime boss Don Falcone orders Jack to deal with Demarkov. Jack is unable to kill her; she seduces and makes a fool of him. Falcone, disappointed in Jack's ineptitude, orders one of his toes amputated. Realizing he has endangered both his wife and mistress, Jack instructs Natalie to leave the city immediately, giving her all the payoff money he's saved as well as instructions where to meet him out West when the time is right. Jack ends his affair with Sheri and puts her on a train out of the city. Jack tries to hunt Demarkov but soon realizes that he is putty in her hands. He is attracted to her sexually and no match for her professionally. Mona forces him to help her bury Falcone alive, then offers to pay Jack to help her fake her own death.  Although he obtains phony papers for her, she refuses to pay and attempts to strangle him. He shoots and wounds her in the arm, then tries to drive away with her handcuffed in the back seat. Mona escapes by hooking her legs around his neck, causing him to crash the car. She slithers out through the shattered windshield without freeing her hands. Mona lures Jack to an abandoned warehouse. He again attempts to kill her but is tricked into shooting Sheri instead. Mona fixes the corpse so as to suggest that it was she, and not Sheri, who died. Mona handcuffs Jack to the bed and they have sex.  She turns Jack in, copping a plea deal that will indict Jack for the multiple murders that she tricked him into committing. The police arrange a confrontation between Jack and Demarkov at the courthouse, as he is heading in and she is heading out. She threatens to kill his wife. Jack grabs a gun from the ankle holster of a fellow officer and shoots her dead. He turns the gun on himself, only to discover that the revolver is empty. Instead of being sent to prison for the murder, he is given a commendation. This frees him to begin a new life out West, with the new identity of "Jim Daugherty". He imagines Natalie's return, but, as Mona told him, Natalie is long gone, never to return. A despondent Jim is resigned to living life alone in a remote desert town.  
Robot Wars (film)
 By 2041, North America has been ravaged by "the great [[toxic gas]] scare of 1993": large swaths of land have been turned into inhospitable desert, where bands of raiders called "Centros" attack transports. The former United States have been assimilated into a [[Western bloc]] called the North Hemi. The opposing Eastern bloc is known as the Eastern Alliance, and the North Hemi is planning to salvage its economy by manufacturing defense robots called "mini-megs" for the Eastern Alliance. These robots would be smaller offshoots of giant "mega-robots", once ubiquitous in warfare but now reduced to a single specimen, the MRAS-2 (which looks like a mechanized scorpion).  MRAS-2 conducts tours for civilians, and carries [[laser]] assault weapons to defend itself. It is operated by Drake ([[Don Michael Paul]]) and his [[copilot]] Stumpy ([[James Staley]]). During a transport run, Drake's mech is ambushed by Centros. Drake opts for a defensive strategy, but his boss Rooney orders him to attack so he can show off the robot to general Wa-Lee ([[Danny Kamekona]]), a visiting dignitary from the Eastern Alliance sent to negotiate the purchase of the mini-megs. The violent rocking motions of the mech during the battle cause an [[archaeologist]] passenger, Leda ([[Barbara Crampton]]), to drop and break her valuable specimens. When Drake brings the robot to port, Leda angrily confronts him about the specimens, but he dismisses her with flirtatious remarks.  Drake is summoned to Rooney's office, and shows him a recovered Centro weapon which appears to be of Eastern alliance origin. Drake deduces that the Eastern alliance is conspiring with the Centros, but Rooney disbelieves him. Drake pressures Rooney to stop the MRAS-2 tours to avoid risking more lives, and when his boss refuses, Drake vows to quit piloting the robot. Meanwhile, Leda has met with her journalist friend Anne, and exposes some suspicious activity going on in Crystal Vista, a perfectly preserved 20th-century town that survived the toxic gas scare: the town is built on a layer of 21st-century materials which are impenetrable to satellite imaging, and she has found components similar to those of the old MEGA-1 robot, which was supposedly dismantled.  Later, Wa-Lee holds a traditional fighting ceremony and invites Drake, who apparently has long-standing animosity against him, to fight. Drake accepts, and knocks Wa-Lee down before the battle begins proper, cementing the tension between them. Drake then makes good on his promise to Rooney and gives up pilot duty to volunteer for a special op against the Centros; there he recovers more Eastern-manufactured equipment. Despite Drake's insistence that the MRAS-2 is under threat from Centros, Rooney allows the tour to proceed, and even has Wa-Lee taught how to pilot the robot as a courtesy. At a bar later on, Stumpy tells Drake that his grandfather was part of an effort to hide MEGA-1. Meanwhile, Leda and Anne have ridden the MRAS-2 to Crystal Vista. There, they go underground through the basement of a schoolhouse, and find the micron [[transponders]] of the MEGA-1. Anne returns to catch the MRAS-2 return trip, while Leda stays behind to continue the investigation.  Suddenly, Centros appear and chase Leda. She escapes for a while, and the rest of the Centros head for the Crystal Vista robot port. There, they join Wa-Lee's officers in a mutiny and kill the North Hemi security, proving Drake right about the Eastern alliance's duplicity. Wa-Lee hijacks the MRAS-2, taking the passengers [[hostage]], and begins destroying strategic targets. Rooney pleads with Drake and Stumpy to retake the robot, and they agree upon learning that the Centros have captured Leda. The general heads for Crystal Vista to kill Drake, who has freed Leda, found the MEGA-1 intact, reactivated it and is now piloting it.  The two robots meet in the desert and begin fighting. Drake removes the MRAS-2's cabin, saving the passengers, and eventually manages to subdue the general. The film ends happily as he and Leda admit their attraction to each other.

Rudy (film)
  In the late 1960s, Daniel Eugene "Rudy" Ruettiger grows up in [[Joliet, Illinois]], dreaming of playing [[college football]] at [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]]. Though he achieved some success with his [[high school football|high school]] team at [[Joliet Catholic Academy|Joliet Catholic]], he lacks the grades and money necessary to attend Notre Dame, as well as the talent and physical stature to play football for a major intercollegiate program.  After high school, Rudy takes a job at a local steel mill like his father, Daniel Sr., a Notre Dame fan, and his two older brothers, Frank and John. When his best friend Pete, who supports his dream of playing football for Notre Dame, is killed in an explosion at the mill, Rudy decides to follow his dream of attending Notre Dame and playing for the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Fighting Irish]].  In 1972, Rudy travels to [[South Bend, Indiana]] to the Notre Dame campus but is not academically eligible for Notre Dame. With the help and sponsorship of a Notre Dame priest, Father Cavanaugh, Rudy enrolls at [[Holy Cross College (Indiana)|Holy Cross College]], a nearby [[junior college]], hoping to get good enough grades to qualify for a transfer. He then approaches a Notre Dame stadium head groundskeeper named Fortune and volunteers to work on the field for free. Fortune offers a job at minimum wage. Currently homeless, Rudy sneaks in and out of Fortune's office at night through a window and sleeps on a cot. At first, Fortune is indifferent towards Rudy but later provides him with blankets for the cot and a key of his own to the office, even though Fortune later denies it. Rudy learns that Fortune has never seen a Notre Dame football game, despite having worked at the stadium for years.  Rudy befriends D-Bob, a graduate student at Notre Dame and a [[teaching assistant]] at Rudy's junior college. D-Bob offers to tutor Rudy in exchange for help in meeting girls around the Holy Cross campus. After some time, suspecting an underlying cause to Rudy's previous academic problems, D-Bob has him tested, and Rudy finds out that he has [[dyslexia]]. Rudy learns how to overcome his disability and becomes a better student. During Christmas vacation, Rudy returns home to his family's appreciation of his college attendance and report card but is still mocked for his attempts at playing college football and loses his fiancée to his older brother John.  After two years at Holy Cross and three rejections from Notre Dame, Rudy is finally admitted to Notre Dame during his final semester of transfer eligibility. He goes home to tell his family, with his father announcing the Notre Dame admission news to his steel mill workers over the loudspeaker. Rudy decides to  return to Notre Dame immediately and attempt to make the football team as a walk-on. Rudy soon persuades Fortune to promise to come see his first game if Rudy is permitted to suit up for one game. After [[Walk-on (sports)|"walking on"]] as a non-scholarship player for the football team and competing well, a strong-willed Rudy convinces head coach [[Ara Parseghian]] to give him a spot on the daily practice squad. Assistant coach Yonto warns the walk on players that thirty five scholarship players will not even make the "dress roster" of players who take the field during the games but at practices notices that Rudy exhibits more drive than many of his scholarship teammates at Notre Dame.  At season's end, Coach Parseghian agrees to Rudy's request to suit up for one home game in his senior year so his family and friends can see him as a member of the Notre Dame team. However, Parseghian retires as coach following the [[1974 NCAA Division I football season|1974 season]] and is replaced by a former [[National Football League|NFL]] coach [[Dan Devine]]. Coach Devine keeps Rudy on the practice team but refuses to place him on the active playing game day roster. When Rudy sees that he is not on the dress list for the team's next-to-last home game, he becomes distraught and quits the team.  Fortune sees Rudy at the stadium instead of at practice and chastises him for quitting the team. As they talk, Rudy learns that Fortune ''has'' seen his share of Notre Dame games because he was once on the team but has never seen one from the stands. Years earlier, Fortune had angrily left the team because he felt that he was not playing in games due to his color. Fortune reminds Rudy that he has nothing to prove to anyone but himself, and that not a day will go by when he will not regret quitting. With that advice, Rudy returns to the team.  In an attempt to get Devine to list Rudy on the game day roster, led by [[Captain (sports)|team captain]] and [[All-America]]n Roland Steele, the other Notre Dame seniors rise to Rudy's defense and lay their jerseys on Devine's desk, each requesting that Rudy should be allowed to dress in his place for the season's final game. In response, a relunctant Devine lets Rudy suit up for the next game against [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]].  On gameday, with Rudy's family and D-Bob in attendance, Captain Steele invites Rudy to lead the team out of the tunnel onto the playing field. Fortune is there to see the Notre Dame-Georgia Tech game as promised. As the game nears its end with Notre Dame winning 17–3, Devine sends all the seniors into the game but not Rudy, despite urging from Steele and other assistant coaches. That week at Notre Dame there had been a story about Rudy and his walk-on football career in the student newspaper, so the fans are aware of what Rudy was trying to accomplish. Suddenly, a fan led "Rudy!" chant begins in the stadium. Hearing the chants, the Notre Dame offensive team, led by [[Halfback (American football)|tailback]] Jamie O'Hara, overrules Devine's call for [[Quarterback kneel|victory formation]] and scores another quick touchdown instead, providing defensive player Rudy with one more chance to get into a game and thus be entered onto the official roster of Notre Dame football players.  Devine finally lets Rudy play on the kickoff by Notre Dame to Georgia Tech. Rudy then stays in for the final play of the game and sacks the Georgia Tech quarterback. Rudy is carried off the field on his teammates' shoulders o cheers from the stadium.  An epilogue to the 1993 film stated that after 1975, no other player for Notre Dame had been carried off the field to the time of the film's release. Rudy graduated from the university in 1976, and all his younger brothers later went on to college to earn degrees.

Rudaali
 As the narrative begins, the dying zamindar/ Thakur (translation: landlord) ([[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]]) of the desert village of Barna has been shifted from his mansion to an outbuilding and is performing the rite of ''godaan'' or gifting a cow to a brahman. Anticipating his imminent death, and realizing that none of his close relatives are likely to mourn him, he summons a rudaali named Bhikni ([[Rakhee Gulzar|Rakhee]]) from a nearby town. While waiting for her client to die, Bhikni temporarily lodges in the modest home of Shanichari ([[Dimple Kapadia]]), a widow whose life has been plagued by misfortune. Born on a Saturday (a bad-luck day ruled by the malefic planet Shanichar or Saturn), the ill-omened young girl was blamed by villagers for the untimely death of her father, and then for her own abandonment by her mother, Peewli, who ran off to join a ''nautanki'' folk theatre troupe. The tale of Shanichari’s life, told to the sympathetic Bhikni, unfolds in a series of flashbacks.<ref>[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1809394439/details Rudaali Production Details | Box Office - Yahoo! Movies]</ref>  Shanichari's early marriage to a drunkard named Ganju ends abruptly when her husband succumbs to an outbreak of plague at a village fair. She is left with a son, Budhua (played as an adult by [[Raghubir Yadav|Raghuveer Yadav]]), whom she adores, though she realizes that he has inherited her mother's penchant for irresponsible wandering. Her poverty is relieved somewhat by employment at the zamindar's haveli (mansion) after the master's son, Lakshman Singh ([[Raj Babbar]]) takes a fancy to her. She attends on his spoiled but strictly secluded wife, and periodically converses with her benefactor, who lectures her on social equality and urges her to "look up" into his eyes when speaking to him. This romance leads to the master's gift to Shanichari, one night after a singing performance, of her own house and two acres of land—a gesture that offers her a modicum of financial security within the village.  One day, Budhua brings home a pregnant young prostitute, Mungri ([[Sushmita Mukherjee]]) as his wife. Their marriage is brief, as the quarrelsome Mungri aborts their child, Shanichari's hoped-for grandson. Budhua then runs away from home.  Shanichari's painful reminiscences of these trials—throughout which, she says, she has never been able to shed a tear—alternate with scenes in the present, depicting her growing bond with Bhikni.  On the very night of the old zamindar's long-awaited death, Bhikni is called over to meet Bhimdata from the neighbouring village. As Shanichari bids adieu to Lakshman Singh, who plans to leave the village after his father's death, a messenger comes from Bhimdata. The messenger tells her of Bhikni's untimely death due to the plague, and of how in her dying breath she had asked Shanichari to be informed of how she was actually Peewli, her mother. This unleashes Shanichari's pent-up emotions and transforms her, too, into a rudaali.

Seeing that his charade is about to come to an abrupt end, Jugran tries to run away. It is revealed that Ramesh had given the tip-off about Jugran to Ravi.

Clips appear from the debut of each Sailor Guardian, and that girl's [[image song]] plays in the background. When even Tuxedo Mask has been mentioned, and the girls are about to leave, Usagi butts in on their conversation and asks them directly about Sailor Moon. The girls give a series of glowing compliments about Sailor Moon, but unlike their analysis of the other Sailor Guardians, they also list her faults.

The Sandlot
  In the [[San Fernando Valley]] during the summer of 1962, Scotty Smalls is the new boy in the neighborhood, seeking desperately to fit in. He would be welcomed on the local sandlot baseball team that practices every day, which only has eight players. Smalls, however, cannot play baseball; on his first visit to the sandlot he finds himself in the outfield with a [[Batted ball|fly ball]] descending toward him which bounces off his glove, causing the other boys, except Benny "the Jet" Rodriguez, the team's leader, to burst out laughing. Smalls, humiliated, leaves the baseball field.  Smalls asks his stepfather to teach him to play, and while his stepdad agrees, Scott cannot successfully catch or throw the ball. Benny soon teaches him what he needs to know, and with Benny's support, he gets a place on the team.  Meanwhile, behind a wall at the end of the sandlot is a backyard inhabited by "the Beast", an [[English Mastiff]] so large and savage that it has become a neighborhood legend. One day, the boys' last ball lands in the Beast's backyard. Smalls attempts to retrieve it, but the others, knowing about the Beast, stop him. That evening, they tell him all about the Beast, and that his owner, Mr. Mertle, got him when he was just a puppy when thieves were plaguing his junkyard, Mertle's Acres. After a couple of weeks, the puppy became the Beast; he grew enormous and aggressive, killing and devouring the thieves, bones and all. Eventually, Squints' grandfather, who was the police chief at the time, had Mr. Mertle chain up the Beast in the backyard and keep him under his house forever. Smalls also learns that many baseballs end up in the backyard, and then they just disappear.  The next day, at a local swimming pool, Squints pretends to drown so that he can kiss the lifeguard, Wendy Peffercorn, whom he has a crush on. She does not take too kindly to it, and they are banned from the pool. Nonetheless, she realizes that Squints has feelings for her.  One day, Benny busts the guts out of their baseball and Smalls steals his stepfather's ball. After that ball also ends up with the Beast, Smalls discovers the ball was special; it was signed by [[Babe Ruth]]. Smalls' stepfather has gone to Chicago for a week-long business trip, putting Smalls and the others on a race against time to recover the ball before he returns. They make many attempts to retrieve the ball, but the Beast thwarts each attempt. One night, Benny has a dream in which Babe Ruth gives him advice, and Benny explains to him about the Beast, saying that he ate one kid who hopped the fence and went into Mr. Mertle's backyard.  The next day, Benny puts on [[PF Flyers]], shoes "guaranteed" to make a kid run faster and jump higher, and goes into Mr. Mertle's backyard, despite protests from his team. Benny retrieves the ball, but the Beast breaks his chain and escapes, chasing Benny through the streets, a theater, a picnic, the local swimming pool and eventually back to the sandlot. Mr. Mertle's fence falls on top of the Beast, but Smalls and Benny manage to get the fence off him; he shows the kids that he has been keeping all the baseballs they hit into the backyard in a small hole. Smalls and Benny then meet Mr. Mertle, who reveals that the Beast's real name is Hercules, an [[English Mastiff]], and that he knew Babe Ruth, because he was also a baseball player who went blind after getting hit by a baseball. Mr. Mertle trades the destroyed Babe Ruth-autographed baseball for a baseball signed by all of the [[1927 New York Yankees]], which Smalls gives to his stepfather as a gift to make up for the other ball.  The sandlot boys enjoy the rest of the summer and the next few years, with the Beast as their mascot. Over the next three decades, the boys grow up and go into different careers. Benny and Smalls remain close; Benny becomes a famous [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] player, while Smalls becomes a sportscaster.  
Sankofa (film)
 The film starts off with an elderly Divine Drummer, Sankofa (played by [[Kofi Ghanaba]]), beating on African drums chanting the phrase, "Lingering spirit of the dead, rise up". This is his form of communication with the [[ancestor]]s of the African land. He believes that his drumming is essential in bringing the spirit of his ancestors who were killed in the African diaspora back home.<ref name=":0" /> The story then goes on to show Mona (Oyafunmike Ogunlano), a contemporary [[African-American]] [[Model (person)|model]] on a film shoot in [[Ghana]]. She has a session at [[Cape Coast Castle]], which she does not know was historically used for the Atlantic [[slave trade]]<ref name="Kandé">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3820726 Sylvie Kandé and Joe Karaganis, "Look Homeward, Angel: Maroons and Mulattoes in Haile Gerima's "Sankofa", ''Research in African Literatures''], 29 (Summer, 1998), pp. 128-146</ref> because she has been disconnected from her [[Africa]]n roots for so long. While Mona is on the beach modeling, she encounters the mysterious old man, Sankofa, who was beating on the drums at the beginning of the film. Sankofa persistently reminds Mona to return to her past and is very belligerent when it comes to keeping the place of his ancestors’ sacred, so he attempts to kick white tourists out of the slave castle.<ref name=":1"></ref> When Mona decides to go take a look inside the castle herself, she gets trapped inside and enters a sort of [[trance]] in which she is surrounded by chained slaves who appear to have risen from the dead. Mona attempts to run out of the slave castle and is met by white slave masters who she tries to reason with by claiming she of American descent and not of [[African descent]]. The slave masters pay no attention to Mona’s claim and push her to a fire, strip off her clothing and put a hot iron on her back.  Mona is then transported into the body of a house servant named Shola "to live the life of her enslaved ancestors."<ref name=":0" /> She is taken to the Lafayette [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] in the [[Southern United States]] where she suffers abuse by her slave masters and is often a victim of rape. On the plantation, Shola encounters many characters including Nunu (Alexandra Duah), an African-born field hand who went about her day-to-day life with Africa still living in her heart and was characterized as a "strong motherly slave with a rebel mindset";<ref name=":3"></ref> Noble Ali ([[Afemo Omilami]]), a headman with split loyalty between his masters and fellow slaves and who deeply loved Nunu and refused to let anything happen to her; and Shango ([[Mutabaruka]]), a rebellious [[West Indian]] slave who was sold to the Lafeyettes' after being deemed a trouble-maker and who soon became the lover of Shola. Shango is named after [[Shango|a Yoruba god]] and displays loyalty to his fellow slaves to the extent that he would risk his own life. There are many instances where Shango gets himself in trouble for attempting to fight on behalf of another slave.<ref name=":0" /> Shango often performs rebellious acts such as trying to get Shola to poison the overseer or even cutting down sugar canes out of anger. When asked about why he will not simply run away from the plantation, he says it is because he can not leave his fellow slaves behind. Both Nunu and Shango resist and rebel against the slave system by doing everything in their power to gain freedom. Shola witnesses Nunu and Shango being actively involved in a secret society that had meetings at night and had memberships consisting of slaves from the Lafayette plantation as well as other plantations.  At first, Shola claims that she can not get herself to join the secret society due to the Christian in her.<ref name=":2"></ref> The slaves of the society altogether decide to execute a revolt which leaves a bunch of sugar cane land in ashes.  Nunu comes into conflict with her own [[mixed-race]] son, Joe, who is fathered by a white man who raped Nunu on a slave ship. Joe (Nick Medley) has been made a head slave and often has to discipline other slaves in order to keep his master happy. Joe completely neglects his African identity and considers himself a white Christian male.<ref name=":1" /> He is brainwashed by Father Raphel ([[imdbname:0141883|Reginald Carter]]) who teaches Joe that the Africans on the plantation, including his own mother, are devil worshippers and that Joe could not identify with them.<ref name=":0" /> Joe ends up killing his mother, Nunu, because he believes that she is possessed. He later realizes that his action was demoralizing and that he had no reason to forgive himself. After Nunu’s death, some believe that she was metaphorically able to return home on the wings of a bird, meaning that her deep desire to return to Africa was finally fulfilled.  Throughout the film, Shola gradually transforms from being a compliant slave to one that gains rebellious instincts after being given the Sankofa bird by Shango.<ref name=":2" /> The bird once belonged to Shango’s father and Shango decided to pass it on to Shola after she was [[flogged]] for attempting to run away. Inspired by Nunu and Shango's determination to defy the system, Shola joins them in fighting back against her masters in a rebellion where she retaliates at her white rapist and kills him.<ref name=":2" /> After her trials, Shola returns to the present as Mona, deeply aware of her African roots.<ref name="Kandé" /> She is greeted by a woman who says "My child, welcome back" and walks past the photographer who symbolizes [[colonialism]] and [[westernization]].<ref></ref> Mona is now enlightened and is captivated by the sound of Sankofa’s chants and his African drum. She joins a group of black people who have also learned what Sankofa really means and are reconnecting to their roots. Nunu comes out of the slave castle while Mona was in a trance and sheds tears of joy. Meanwhile, Sankofa, the Divine Drummer, beats on his African drums chanting: "Lingering spirit of the dead, rise up and possess the stolen spirit of those stolen in Africa". The film<ref></ref> ends with a bird soaring high in the sky signifying the final liberation of those who had found the true meaning of the word "Sankofa" and had reconnected to their past.

Schindler's List
 In [[Kraków]] during [[World War II]], the Germans have forced local [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] into the overcrowded [[Kraków Ghetto]]. [[Oskar Schindler]], an [[ethnic German]], arrives in the city hoping to make his fortune. A member of the [[Nazi Party]], Schindler lavishes bribes on [[Wehrmacht]] (German armed forces) and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officials and acquires [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory|a factory]] to produce [[enamelware]]. To help him run the business, Schindler enlists the aid of [[Itzhak Stern]], a local Jewish official who has contacts with [[black market]]eers and the Jewish business community. Stern helps Schindler arrange financing for the factory. Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys wealth and status as "Herr Direktor", and Stern handles administration. Schindler hires Jewish workers because they cost less, while Stern ensures that as many people as possible are deemed essential to the German war effort, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps or killed.  SS-''[[Untersturmführer]]'' (second lieutenant) [[Amon Göth]] arrives in Kraków to oversee construction of [[Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp|Płaszów concentration camp]]. When the camp is completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are shot and killed in the process of emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat as she hides from the Nazis, and later sees her body among a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. Göth brutally mistreats his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa, and the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp.  As the Germans begin to lose the war, Göth is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at Płaszów to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Schindler asks Göth to allow him to move his workers to a new munitions factory he plans to build in [[Brněnec|Brinnlitz]] near his home town [[Svitavy|Zwittau]]. Göth agrees, but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern create "Schindler's List" – a list of about 850 people to be transferred to Brinnlitz and thus saved from transport to Auschwitz.  The train carrying the women and children is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes [[Rudolf Höss]], the commandant of Auschwitz, with a bag of diamonds to win their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the factory floor and encourages the Jews to observe the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]]. Over the next seven months, he spends much of his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies; due to Schindler's own machinations, the factory does not produce any usable armaments during this period. Schindler runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders, ending the war in Europe.  As a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing [[Red Army]] to avoid capture. The SS guards in Schindler's factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to, so that they can "return to [their] families as men, instead of murderers." He bids farewell to his workers and prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give Schindler a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a [[Talmud]]ic quotation: "Whoever saves one life saves the world entire." Schindler is touched, but also ashamed, as he feels he should have done even more. As the ''[[Schindlerjuden]]'' wake up the next morning, a Soviet soldier arrives to announce that they have been liberated. The Jews leave the factory and walk to a nearby town.  In an epilogue, actual ''Schindlerjuden'', accompanied by the actors who portrayed them, place stones on Schindler's grave.

Head housekeeper Mrs. Medlock informs Mary she will not be spoiled as she was in India and that her uncle, who spends extended periods of time away from the Manor, will likely not see her. Mary is ordered not to leave her room, but strange noises lead her to explore the mansion on her own. Mrs. Medlock eventually allows her to play outside to keep her from poking about the house.  In the expansive grounds of the Manor, Mary discovers her late aunt's garden, which was locked and neglected since her accidental death ten years prior.  Martha Sowerby, a maid, and her brother, Dickon, a nature-loving boy who can "talk" to animals, befriend Mary. Fascinated by the "secret garden," Mary enlists Dickon to help her bring it back to life, gradually becoming a more friendly, happy child in the process.

She shows him that he's not actually sick, and that the outside world is not as dangerous as Mrs. Medlock, who is in charge of caring for him, claims.  Encouraged by Mary, Colin decides to go outside for the first time in his life. Mary and Dickon take him to the secret garden and Colin begins his own healing process.  Colin, Mary, and Dickon spend all of their time in the garden, where Colin learns to both stand and walk on his own. Anxious to show Colin's new-found life to his father, they perform a "magic" ceremony in hopes to bring him back home. It appears to work, as Lord Craven awakens suddenly from a dream of his late wife calling him home. He immediately returns to Yorkshire. He discovers Colin walking and playing upon his return, which leaves him dumbfounded with joy. Mary runs off and breaks down in tears, fearful that both she and the garden will be neglected and locked away again.

Short Cuts
 A fleet of helicopters sprays for [[medfly|medflies]] and reveals all the characters along the path of their flight. Dr. Ralph Wyman and his wife, Marian, meet another couple, Stuart and Claire Kane, at Zoe Trainer's cello concert and make a spontaneous Sunday dinner date. Marian's sister, Sherri, is married to philandering cop Gene, who invents unbelievable stories to hide his affair with Betty Weathers. Betty is in the process of divorcing one of the helicopter pilots, Stormy. Waitress Doreen Piggot is married to an alcoholic limo driver, Earl. Television commentator Howard Finnigan lives with his wife, Anne, and their young son, Casey, next door to Zoe and her mother, cabaret singer Tess. Their pool cleaner is Jerry Kaiser, whose wife, Lois, works from home as a phone sex operator by tending to the children while she talks off strange men. Jerry and Lois are friends with Doreen's daughter, Honey, and her husband, Bill, who works as a makeup artist.  The day before the eighth birthday of Casey, Doreen hits him with her car as he is running to school. Casey appears fine and refuses Doreen's offer of a ride home, as she is a stranger. His mother comes home from ordering his birthday cake to find him slumped lethargically on the couch. Howard convinces her to take Casey to the hospital, where he remains unconscious. The baker calls the next day to inform Ann that the cake is ready, but Howard, wanting to keep the line free, briskly ends the conversation. The baker immediately calls back, incensed at being hung up on. While the Finnigans maintain their vigil, the baker continues to call and harass the couple. Howard's estranged father turns up at the hospital and recalls that Casey's hospitalization reminds him of the day that Howard was in a car accident as a boy. When Howard's mother went to her sister's house, she found her in bed with her husband, whom she had seduced. That led to the estrangement between father and son.  Stuart and his two friends, Gordon and Vern, harass Doreen at the diner before they head out on their three-day fishing trip. On the first day, they find a young woman's body, submerged near some rocks. After some debate, they decide to tie her to the rocks, continue fishing, and report the body when they are done. When he comes home, Stuart eventually admits to Claire what they had done, and she is disgusted that they could fish for days with the woman's body nearby. The body is identified as a 23-year-old woman, and Claire visits the funeral home out of a sense of guilt.  Stormy visits Betty's house, ostensibly to pick up his mother's clock but instead spends the day destroying her belongings. Bill and Honey entertain themselves in the apartment that they are watching while its owners are on vacation by taking some pictures of Honey in which Bill has made her up to look as if she were brutally beaten. Gene abandons the family dog on a strange street because he cannot endure its barking, but after several days of his distraught children's inquiries, he returns to the neighbourhood and retrieves the dog, who had been picked up by Vern's family. The Wymans get into a massive argument just before their dinner party with the Kanes. Marian admits to an affair. Both couples alleviate their stress by drinking heavily, and the party lasts all night long.  One day, Casey's eyes begin to flutter. Ann's excitement grows, but just as he appears to be fully waking, he suddenly dies. Seeing that and being overwhelmed, Howard's father, Paul, leaves the hospital while the distraught couple returns home and informs Zoe of Casey's death. The next day, they go to the bakery to shame the baker over his abuse of them. When he learns why they never picked up the cake, he asks them to stay and gives them baked goods. Zoe, worn to the breaking point by her mother's alcoholism and her isolation, commits suicide by starting a car engine inside her garage; she plays the cello as she asphyxiates. Later that day, her mother discovers Zoe's death and is bewildered.  When Honey picks up the pictures from the developer, they are mixed up with Gordon's. He is horrified to see the pictures of Honey, who is apparently beaten so badly, and she is horrified by the pictures Gordon took of the submerged body on his fishing trip. They walk away from each other, memorizing each other's license plates. Honey and Bill are on their way to a picnic with Jerry and Lois. In the park, Jerry and Bill try to rape two young women they encountered earlier, and Bill quickly makes an excuse to divvy up into couples. As he and one of the girls walk away from Jerry and the other girl, they hear her scream. They turn around to see Jerry hitting her in the head with a rock, just as a major earthquake strikes. In the aftermath, Jerry's murder of the girl is attributed to a falling rock during the earthquake.  
Sidekicks (1992 film)
 Barry Gabrewski is an [[asthma]]tic boy who lives with his widowed father, Jerry Gabrewski ([[Beau Bridges]]), in [[Houston, Texas]]. A loner, Barry has vivid [[daydream]]s about being [[Chuck Norris]]' sidekick, battling against Norris's movie enemies, who are often personified by Barry's everyday bullies such as Randy Cellini (John Buchanan). Noreen Chan ([[Julia Nickson-Soul]]), his favorite teacher, often plays the damsel in distress in these daydreams.  Barry wants to learn the martial arts, but is rejected by the arrogant dojo owner Kelly Stone ([[Joe Piscopo]]) for being too weak. Instead, he is taken on as a student by an old Chinese man called Mr. Lee ([[Makoto Iwamatsu|Mako]]), the sly uncle of his teacher and the owner of a local Chinese restaurant, "Frying Dragon". Mr. Lee finds creative ways to teach Barry to defend himself from his bullies. Lee devises training methods that increase Barry's endurance, which helps his asthma. Lee also deduces Barry's hero worship of Norris and from that, deduces at least some of Barry's daydreams. He creatively incorporates this into Barry's training, creating training scenarios that seem more dangerous than they are so that Barry will feel heroic for succeeding at them.  Lee enters himself, Barry, and Chan into a local team Karate tournament but is a bit stymied to learn that a team must have four members. Norris is attending the tournament as a guest. Chan (at Lee's urging) convinces Norris to join the team. Norris is both willing to help an ardent fan and has his own motivation for participating: he has encountered Stone on several prior occasions and wants to teach him "a lesson in humility." Barry is stunned to find himself working together with his hero.  The tournament involves four events: [[Breaking (martial arts)|Breaking]], Men's Weapons, Female Kata, and Freestyle fighting. Stone's team narrowly defeats Chan in the Female Kata, but Lee defeats Cellini, one of Stone's students, in Breaking. True to his word, Norris defeats Stone in Freestyle fighting. Barry—aided by a vivid daydream—scores a victory in Men's Weapons. The result is a tie between Stone's team and Lee's team. In the tie-breaker, Lee is allowed to choose the participants, and chooses Barry and Cellini, saying Barry is the member of the team with "something to prove." Stone chooses the event, Breaking. Barry is dismayed to be confronting Cellini in the latter's best event but Lee tilts the odds in Barry's favor by using a small amount of lighter fluid to set Barry's bricks on fire. Faced with a much more heroic-seeming task, Barry wins.  After the tournament, Barry is seen talking to Norris, thanking him for his help. Norris vanishes, and it is implied that Barry has found the strength to live his life without the need for his daydreams. Before the movie fades to black, a young boy finds Barry's Chuck Norris magazine. With an excited "Wow" the camera pans out to reveal the young man is in a wheelchair.  
Shattered Trust: The Shari Karney Story
 Situated in the early 1980s, Shari Karney is a successful attorney, assigned to an [[incest]] case, involving a three-year-old girl, Christie, who is being [[child molestation|molested]] by her father.  She initially refuses to take the case, explaining that she isn't familiar with cases involving [[sexual abuse]]. She is later convinced by the child's mother, Darlene Holland, but the trial proves to be difficult.  Nine months later, she is heavily invested in the case, which involves her private life.  She has trouble sleeping at night and is often bothered by flashbacks of her own past.  Whenever she tries to make love with her boyfriend Mark, she suffers [[panic attack]]s.   She eventually attacks David Holland, the man charged, in the courtroom and is therefore sent to jail for two days.  Shari fears she has ruined the case, but Darlene insists on holding her as her lawyer.  The judge, however, puts her on [[probation]] and forces her to seek psychological help.  She contacts psychiatrist Joan Delvecchio and admits to her that she is constantly hearing typing sounds.  She reveals that as a child she was [[child abuse|physically abused]] by her mother, and that her father had done nothing to protect her.   Her sister Linda thinks therapy would be good for her, explaining that there must be a reason that she never wore make-up and always wore baggy clothes. At court, David is prohibited from seeing his daughter for six months.  Shari is furious that thereafter, he is allowed to see her again, claiming that he then will keep on [[rape|raping]] her. Meanwhile, in therapy, Joan notices that Shari shows the same symptoms as rape victims, but thinks it could be explained by her fathers's abuse.  When Mark finds out she has taken another incest case, he leaves her.   She turns to her parents, but her mother blames her for having driven Mark away.  Her therapist makes her write a letter to her mother.  When writing, not only does she express the hatred she feels for her mother, but also reveals that she is an incest victim herself, having been abused by her father for years. She starts to remember everything and finds out that she buried the abuse so deep that she didn't consciously remember it.    In sessions, Joan helps her remember the entire truth and eventually Shari tells that her father raped her after typing, which explains the sounds of typing she heard.  She confronts her parents, but they respond with outrage, claiming they will never forgive her for the accusation.  Linda refuses to believe her as well and has trouble even accepting the possibility.  At work, her new client withdraws and Christie is hospitalized.  Frustrated, she is determined to change the law, allowing incest victims to sue their parents whenever they want to, without a [[statute of limitations]].   She contacts Stephanie Chadford, another lawyer who tried to change the incest law.  This requires her to step to the media, telling her own story.  She is immediately estranged from her sister and disowned by her parents.  Meanwhile, the process of changing a law proves to be exhausting, taking up to six years to even qualify in court, and her emotional involvement upsets her partners, who eventually fire her.  In the end, however, the law changes, with Shari's help.

At lunch the next day, Tom confronts Ken when he has heard that he took the credit for his beating the day before. Ken tries to deny it and reason with Tom. However, Tom doesn't listen and proceeds to humiliate Ken by beating him down with his martial arts skills. When Ken is seriously hurt, Mike takes him to Billy. A stunned Billy asks what has happened and Ken, in a fit of rage and embarrassment, tells Billy that he told her mother he didn't want to move. Billy finally tells Ken that he needs to learn to defend himself, and that he will teach him. After school, Billy and Ken begin their training by making Ken do some of Billy's duties by cleaning toilets, dumping trash, and other janitorial duties before they get into the physical training.

She takes him to the dojo, which is also a front for an illegal martial arts competition in which it is revealed that Lee and Tom have been winners in. Kate offers Ken an advance to eventually come up to fight in the ring. Ken refuses and the next day, ken explains to Billy about the money the fighters make. This angers Billy, who has been going undercover and tracking the dojo down. Billy finally reveals to Ken that he was once a cop and he regrets quitting. Ken knows that Billy wants to take the dojo down because of the kids who are fighting. That night, Billy and Spinelli, who Billy called earlier in the day, reunite at the dojo but come up with nothing. Billy takes photos and as the duo walk out, they are met by some of Lee's men.

The following morning, police tape is all over the gym and Ken is concerned and he thinks Billy may be involved.

Tom is infuriated and smacks Julie across the face, prompting Ken to push Tom away. Ken warns Tom never to touch her again. Tom claims to own Julie but Ken reminds him that he doesn't own anyone. As Ken and Tom are about to go to blows, they are stopped by Rob and Gina, Ken decides enough is enough and takes up Tom's challenge to fight at Lee's dojo that Friday night. Without Billy, Ken begins to train hard and even teaches the nerdy Mike a little martial arts too. Meanwhile, Tom really lets his anger out on Rob, who also has had enough of Tom's aggressive behavior.  When the fight is on, Julie is worried that Ken will lose badly. Mike tells Julie that he called the police and told them to show up, but can't remember the time. Both Tom and Ken go back and forth hitting each other to the delight of the crowd. However, Tom soon gets the upper hand, making Lee very happy. When Tom nearly knocks out Ken, Ken looks on the ground and sees Mike and Julie, Billy returns in time, forcing Ken to begin to get the upper hand. As Tom attempts to attack, Ken continues to counter and attack. He finally beats Tom by using a spin kick followed by a jump spinning kick, knocking Tom out. As Ken raises his hand in victory, Lee, upset at Tom, knocks out down and begins to pummel Tom. Ken attempts to stop Lee but fails. As Lee chokes Tom, Billy intervenes and now, it is between Lee and Billy. Both try to out do each other, with Tom now rooting for Billy. However, Lee resorts to dirty tactics such as whipping Billy with a belt and then choking him with the belt, but Billy stops Lee and begins his assault. When he tells Lee he won't hurt any more kids, Billy does the jump spinning kick he taught Ken and knocks Lee out. The police show up and as Kate attempts to escape, she is stopped by Mike. Tom, finally realizing his mistake, offers him hand to Ken only to stop and tells him he will see him around and thanks Billy for saving him.

Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit
 Deloris van Cartier has become a famous actress since her time posing as a [[nun]], performing in [[Las Vegas]]. During her latest performance, she reunites with her friends, Sisters Mary Patrick, Mary Robert, and Mary Lazarus. They ask for her help, reuniting her with Reverend Mother, who explains that the convent nuns now work as teachers at the St. Francis Academy in [[San Francisco]], which Deloris attended as a child. The school faces closure at hands of its administrator, Mr. Crisp, unless the school’s reputation can be improved. The nuns ask Deloris to reprise her persona as Sister Mary Clarence and become the new music teacher. Deloris reluctantly agrees.  At the school, Mary Clarence meets the school’s staff of monks, led by the humble but inept Father Maurice. She attends her first music class, meeting the rowdy teenagers, who are merely there to “pass” just by attending classes. Mary Clarence butts heads with the ringleader, Rita Louise Watson, who walks out when Mary Clarence introduces a firmer hand in class. The other students stay to avoid failure. When they break into spontaneous, synchronised singing, Mary Clarence decides to turn them into a [[choir]], which the students at first object to.  Mary Robert overhears Rita singing, and Mary Clarence convinces her to return to the class. The class and nuns restore the school’s decrepit music room and practice extensively, later performing "Oh, Happy Day" before the whole school, led by the preachy but talented vocalist Ahmal. The nuns discover numerous trophies, revealing the school won the All-State Choir Championship in the past, and decide to enter the choir once again. Father Maurice gives his blessing to the choir’s entry, as long as they raise the money themselves and each student obtains parental consent to attend.  However, Rita’s strict but well-meaning mother Florence refuses to let her daughter attend, believing a musical career is a dead end after her husband died trying to make a name for himself. However, Rita forges her mother’s signature to go on the trip, but leaves an apology note for her, prompting Florence to drive to Hollywood to see the competition for herself. Mr. Crisp recognises Mary Clarence as Deloris and warns Father Maurice of the sham, but the choir has already left for the competition. The monks pile into their old van and race to confront Mary Clarence.  Backstage at the competition, the choir are intimidated by the seasoned veterans and consider quitting, but Mary Clarence’s commitment inspires them to carry on. The monks arrive, and after Father Maurice decides to support the choir upon seeing their change in enthusiasm, the other monks trap Mr. Crisp in a closet to prevent him from interfering with Mary Clarence. The choir takes to the stage, Rita performing a solo before the choir perform an [[urban contemporary gospel]] rendition of “[[Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee]]”, with [[hip hop]]-inspired choreography.  The choir win the competition. The school’s local [[diocese]], impressed with the performance, agree to keep the school open and give the freed Crisp a promotion, Reverend Mother claiming that he came up with the idea for the school choir to begin with. Rita and Florence make amends, while the choir learns that Mary Clarence is actually an actress. They ask her if she is a Las Vegas [[showgirl]], to which Mary Clarence claims she has never been such, but is a “headliner”.  The film closes with the choir and their teachers performing “[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]].”

So I Married an Axe Murderer
 Charlie MacKenzie ([[Mike Myers|Myers]]) is a [[beat poet]] living in [[San Francisco]], after having broken up with yet another woman based on paranoid perception. His friend Tony, a policeman, points out that Charlie simply is afraid of commitment and tries to think of or invent any reason to break up with someone.  Charlie encounters a butcher named Harriet, and the two quickly find common bonds between them. They start to date, and Charlie learns she used to live in [[Atlantic City]], had been involved with a trainer in Russian martial arts, and screams for someone named Ralph in her sleep. After staying at her place one night, Charlie meets Harriet's eccentric sister, Rose, who warns Charlie to be careful. As they continue to see each other, Charlie and Harriet fall in love. He arranges a dinner with her to meet his parents, Stuart and May, who both believe in conspiracy theories and get their news from the ''[[Weekly World News]]'' tabloid. While there, Charlie spots one paper that describes a story about a "Mrs. X", a bride who kills her husbands on their honeymoons using an axe and matches all the mannerism that Harriet has thus far shown.  Charlie becomes paranoid and asks Tony to investigate Harriet and the Mrs. X story. Tony reveals that the husbands of Mrs. X were all reported missing alongside their wives, assuring that Harriet is unlikely to be Mrs. X. Charlie remains on edge, and after a few more troubled dates, decides to break up with her. Tony later reports that a killer in the Mrs. X story has confessed. Relieved, Charlie apologizes to Harriet by reciting one of his beat poems to her from his rooftop. They make up, and Harriet explains away some of the confusion Charlie had from her history, such as Ralph being the name of a woman she knows.  Some time later, Charlie proposes to Harriet, which she reluctantly accepts after some hesitation. Following the wedding ceremony, they embark on a honeymoon to a secluded mountain hotel. After they depart, Tony learns that the confessed killer is actually a [[compulsive liar]]. He sends a photo of Harriet to the known associates of the missing husbands, and all report back that she was their friends' wife. With phone lines to the hotel down due to a storm, Tony charters a plane. Once he lands, he is able to call Charlie locally and warn him that Harriet is really Mrs. X, but the hotel phone line is knocked out and power is lost.  Charlie is panicked and tries to stay away from Harriet without letting her know what he knows, but the hotel staff force him into the honeymoon suite for their first night together. Charlie finds himself alone and discovers a "Dear Jane" letter, purportedly written by him, explaining his absence to Harriet. Suddenly, Rose appears wielding an axe. Rose tells Charlie he was not supposed to find the letter, and reveals herself as the Mrs. X killer - she feels that Harriet's husbands are taking her sister from her, and so killed them on their honeymoon night, leading Harriet to believe that each husband simply left her. Charlie is then trapped in a game of cat-and-mouse, staying away from Rose while waiting for the police to arrive.  Tony leads the police into the hotel but arrests Harriet, still believing her to be the murderer. Having chased Charlie to the hotel roof, Rose swings the axe at Charlie and is thrown off the building, with only Charlie holding her up from falling to her death. Tony comes to catch her fall, where she is arrested and taken away. Charlie and Harriet resume their lives afterward as a happy couple.

Sniper (1993 film)
 [[Master Gunnery Sergeant]] Thomas Beckett (Berenger), [[Force Reconnaissance]] Marine, an experienced sniper, and his spotter, Cpl. Papich ([[Aden Young]]), are on a mission to assassinate a Panamanian rebel leader in the jungle.  Because they are extracted in daylight instead of at night, Papich is killed by a sniper. Beckett runs back under fire to carry Papich's body to the helicopter.  Later, Beckett is paired up with an inexperienced civilian, Richard Miller (Zane), to eliminate a rebel general financed by a Colombian drug lord. Miller is a [[SWAT]] team sharpshooter, with no combat experience or confirmed kills to his name. While on the way to the staging area, Miller's helicopter is attacked by a guerrilla, and several members of the crew are killed. Miller is unable to take out the attacker; instead, the chopper's dying gunner makes the kill, but the co-pilot believes Miller made the crucial shot, earning Miller a false reputation.  On the mission, Beckett insists on deviating from the plan that Miller was given.  This, together with the fact that Miller has no experience or aptitude for jungle operations, sparks friction between the two. Early on, they encounter a group of Indians, who agree to lead them past the rebel guerrillas, in return for a favor: they must agree to eliminate El Cirujano ("The Surgeon"), an ex-CIA agent and expert in torture who has been aiding the rebels.  Beckett agrees to do so.  Uncertain of Miller's reliability and skeptical about his "kill" while aboard the helicopter, he tells Miller to kill El Cirujano in order to prove himself. However, when the time comes, Miller fails again by first firing a "warning shot," followed by a shot at Cirujano's head.  Cirujano is able to dodge the head shot by ducking under it into the river in which he has been swimming.  In the ensuing firefight with the alarmed guerrillas, one of the Indians is killed.  Although the Indians do not directly blame either Beckett or Miller, they withdraw further help.  En route to the target, they realize they are being followed. They head to a village to contact their informant, a priest, only to find that he has been tortured and murdered by Alvarez's men well before they arrived. Beckett speculates out loud that it is the work of El Cirujano, calling into question Miller's credibility. That night, Beckett marks their track to bait the follower - the sniper that killed Papich - into a trap and uses Miller as bait to pull the sniper out of hiding to take him out.  The two men finally reach the general's [[hacienda]]. While waiting for their targets to emerge, they find Cirujano to be alive after all. Miller isn't hidden very well, and is spotted by one of the guards trying to sneak up on Miller. Beckett kills Miller's attacker while Miller takes out the drug lord. Having had to save Miller's life instead of killing the general, Beckett insists on going back to take out the general. Miller's refusal leads to an exchange of fire between Beckett and Miller. Miller ceases after running out of ammunition and suffers a mental breakdown.  As rebels close in on the two, Beckett attempts to provide cover fire for Miller. Seeing himself outnumbered, he surrenders to the rebels and, knowing Miller is watching, stealthily ejects a round from the chamber of his rifle while holding it up, then drops the bullet on the ground; Miller picks it after Beckett is taken away.  With nighttime approaching, Miller goes to the extraction site, but instead of boarding the helicopter, he heads to the base camp, where he kills the general with his knife.  He finds Beckett being tortured by El Cirujano, who has cut off the trigger finger of Beckett's right hand. Beckett spots Miller in the distance and uses a ploy to both distract Cirujano and mouth Miller instruction to kill both of them with one shot. Instead, Miller sticks to "one shot, one kill" and shoots Cirujano in the head. The two run to the helicopter for extraction, and Beckett once again saves Miller's life: using his left hand, he shoots an ambushing sniper. The final scene shows Beckett and Miller on the way back home.

Smoking/No Smoking
 "Smoking" and "No Smoking" are two segments of the film which are based on closely connected plays. The original plays covered eight separate stories, which have been pared down to three each for these movies. At a certain point in the story of each segment, the five female characters (all played by Sabine Azema) and the four male characters (all played by Pierre Arditi) have their lives skillfully recapped in terms of "what might have happened" if they had made or failed to make certain choices. For example, "No Smoking" focuses chiefly on the relationship between the mild-mannered Miles Coombes and his infinitely more aggressive and ambitious wife, Rowena.  The narrator is voiced by [[Peter Hudson (actor)|Peter Hudson]].

Sonatine (1993 film)
 Kitano plays Murakawa, a [[Tokyo]]-based [[yakuza]] enforcer who has grown tired of gangster life. He is sent by his boss to [[Okinawa]], supposedly to mediate a dispute between their allies, the Nakamatsu and Anan clans. Murakawa openly suspects the assignment is an attempt to have him removed and even beats up one of his colleagues, Takahashi, whom he distrusts, but ends up going with his men. He finds that the dispute is insignificant, and while wondering why he was sent to Okinawa at all, the group's temporary headquarters are bombed and they are then ambushed in a bar, leaving several of his men dead.  Fleeing to the seaside, the survivors take refuge in a remote beach house belonging to a brother of one of the Nakamatsu members and decide to wait for the trouble to blow over. Whilst spending time at the beach, the group engages in childish games and pranks and begins to enjoy themselves. However, the games frequently have a violent undertone. When two of his men alternate shooting at a beer can on each other's head, Murakawa turns it into a game of [[Russian roulette]]. Putting the seemingly loaded gun to his head, he pulls the trigger on the last chamber. The chamber is revealed to be empty and Murakawa is unharmed.  Murakawa later dreams of the Russian roulette game, although in his dream, the revolver is loaded and he is killed. When he wakes up, he walks down to the shore. He sees a car pull up, and a man drags a woman into the sand and attempts to rape her. Murakawa stoically watches for a while and then walks past them. When the man realizes Murakawa has been there the whole time and shouts at him, Murakawa headbutts him. The man pulls out a knife and threatens Murakawa. Murakawa then shoots the man, but to his companions, he claims the woman shot him. She then joins Murakawa and the gang at the beach house, and comes frequently to visit, spending time with Murakawa.  Later, an assassin disguised as a fisherman appears. He kills several people, including the boss of the Nakamatsu clan and one of Murakawa's men, in the middle of a frisbee match. Learning that Takahashi is arriving in Okinawa, Murakawa and two of his surviving men visit his hotel. Unable to find him at first, they unexpectedly run into Takahashi and the assassin in the elevator, which results in a shootout, killing the assassin and Murakawa's men. Murakawa learns from interrogating Takahashi that their boss had intended all along to partner with the Anan clan and had sent Murakawa on a suicide mission to take over his turf. He also learns that the boss will be meeting with the Anan that night in a hotel. Takahashi is killed and Murakawa sets off with the only survivor of the group, a member of the Nakamatsu clan, who helps him by rigging the electricity in the hotel to go off at a certain time. Murakawa tells the woman that he may come back, and the woman promises to wait for him.  Later that night, while waiting for all the yakuza to arrive, the Nakamatsu member asks Murakawa to take him with him, but admits that he has had enough when Murakawa asks. When the electricity goes off, Murakawa goes into the hotel and slaughters both clans with an assault rifle. The next morning, while the woman continues to wait for him, Murakawa drives to a spot near the beach and commits [[suicide]] by shooting himself in the head. The scene then switches to the car and the horizon and slowly fades.  
Sommersby
 John "Jack" Sommersby (Gere) left his farm to fight in the [[American Civil War]] and is presumed dead after six years. Despite the hardship of working their farm in Vine Hill, [[Tennessee]], his apparent [[widow]] Laurel (Foster) is content in his absence, because Jack was an unpleasant and abusive husband. She  makes remarriage plans with one of her neighbors, Orin Meacham (Pullman), who has been helping her and her young son with the farmwork.  One day, Jack seemingly returns with a change of heart. He is now kind and loving to Laurel and their young son, Rob. In the evenings, he reads to them from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', which the old Jack never would have done. He claims that the book was given to him by a man he met in prison. Jack and Laurel rekindle their intimacy, which leads to Laurel becoming pregnant.  Displaced from his courtship of Laurel, Meacham suspects Jack as an impostor. The town shoemaker also finds that this man's foot is two sizes smaller than the [[last]] which had been made for Sommersby before the war. In order to revive the local economy, Jack suggests [[Burley (tobacco)|Burley tobacco]] as a cash crop. He raises the seed money by selling parts of his own farm to people who will then work the land to grow tobacco. This raises further doubts in his old neighbors who believe that the "old" Jack would not be so hasty to give away his father's land, as well as resentment among [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] veterans about the inclusion of former slaves.  One black freedman living on Sommersby's land is attacked and dropped at Sommersby's door by men proclaiming themselves the [[Knights of the White Camellia]] (one of them is Meacham). Jack is threatened in an attempt to force him to exclude black people from the landowning, but he refuses.  Upon taking the townspeople's money, he buys the tobacco seed claiming that the crops will raise enough funds to rebuild the town church. All those that bought in on the deal set to work, transforming the plantation into a breeding ground of promise and prosperity. Laurel gives birth to a daughter, Rachel.  Shortly after Rachel's [[baptism]], two [[U.S. Marshals]] arrest Jack on the charge of murder, which carries the [[death penalty]]. Laurel's attempts to save her husband focus on the question of his identity: whether this "Jack" is who he claims to be, or a lookalike who met the real Sommersby whilst in prison for deserting the [[Confederate Army]]. Laurel and Jack's lawyer agree to argue that her husband is an impostor. This would save him from hanging for murder, but he would still be imprisoned  for fraud and military desertion. Meacham devises this plan in exchange for Laurel promising to marry him upon "Sommersby's" imprisonment.  Jack fires the lawyer and sets about re-establishing himself as the real Sommersby. Several witnesses are brought up to discredit this Sommersby as a fraud, who state that he is  Horace Townsend, an English teacher and con artist from Virginia. One witness says that the man currently posing as Jack defrauded his [[township]] of several thousand dollars after claiming he wanted to help rebuild the schoolhouse there. He is also said to have deserted the Confederate Army and ended up in prison. Sommersby discredits the man's testimony by identifying him as one of the Klansmen who had threatened him earlier. He points out that Orin Meacham was another of those men and that this is all a set-up to try to rob the new black farmers of the land they have bought.  When Laurel is called as a witness, she reveals that his kind nature convinced her of his being an impostor, admitting "…because I never loved him the way I love you!" With this, she says that she believes the man before her to be her real husband. Judge Isaacs calls Jack to his bench to ask whether he wishes to be tried as Jack Sommersby, even if it will certainly mean death by hanging. Jack states that he wants to be tried as John "Jack" Sommersby.  Jack is convicted of [[first degree murder]] and sentenced to death by hanging.  While awaiting death, he is asked by Laurel to tell the truth about his identity and Horace Townsend. Laurel mentions the book on Homer's works that he holds. Jack tells her the story of how a man had to share a cell with another man, who looked like they could have been brothers. After sharing a cell for four years, they got to know everything about each other.  Upon his release, Jack Sommersby killed another man, then died from a wound he got during the fight. Horace Townsend then buries Jack Sommersby, which is seen in the opening scene of the film. Horace decided to assume Jack Sommerby's identity. Jack concludes by saying he can't admit to being Horace, because Laurel and the children would lose everything.  As Jack is taken to the [[gallows]], he asks Laurel to be amongst the crowds, as he cannot "hang alone". As Jack is about to be hanged, Laurel makes her way to the front of the crowd. Jack calls for her, claiming to the executioner that he "isn't ready". She calls back to him, and the two see each other before he is executed.  The closing scenes show Laurel walking up a hill with flowers. She then kneels by the gravestone of "John Robert Sommersby" and lays the flowers down for him. It is revealed that work is being done on the steeple of the village church, as Jack had wished.  
Son of the Pink Panther
  Princess Yasmin of Lugash ([[Debrah Farentino]]) is abducted in French territorial waters off the coast of [[Nice]] by terrorists led by a mercenary named Hans ([[Robert Davi]]) in order to force her father to abdicate and allow her disgraced stepmother's lover, a military general with terrorist ties to an unfriendly neighboring kingdom, to claim the throne. Police Commissioner Dreyfus ([[Herbert Lom]]) is tasked with solving the case of the kidnapped princess. While investigating her disappearance in the South of France, he has a run-in with the kidnappers, and a local ''gendarme'', named Jacques Gambrelli ([[Roberto Benigni]]). Gambrelli opens the rear doors of the kidnapper's van and unknowingly spies the Princess who he believes is the driver's sister en route to the hospital.  Hans becomes aware that Gambrelli witnessed the Princess in the back of his van and sends his henchmen to kill Gambrelli as a routine precaution. Dreyfus follows Gambrelli to the hospital where he observes the bumbling Gambrelli's antics with stumbling around as well as getting his bicycle stuck in a wet cement sidewalk outside the hospital. When Hans' henchmen arrive and chase after Gambrelli on his bicycle, Dreyfus intervenes and saves the klutzy policeman. He then takes Gambrelli to his home where he lives with his mother Maria ([[Claudia Cardinale]]) whom Dreyfus recognizes as a suspect in a murder case 30 years ago. During the casual encounter with Maria, Dreyfus learns from her Gambrelli is in fact the illegitimate son of the late Inspector Jacques Clouseau. When Hans' men attempt to plant a bomb under the Gambrelli house, it leads to Dreyfus becoming injured instead and sent to the hospital.  While Maria decides to stay beside the injured Dreyfus at the hospital to see him recover, they both reveal Gambrelli's origins to him as the only known offspring of the late Inspector Clouseau. Gambrelli finally decides to set off to rescue Princess Yasmin and prove himself his father's true heir and legacy. Gambrelli recognizes one of Hans' henchmen at the hospital who is inquiring about a doctor for Hans who is injured after Yasmin had attempted to escape. Impersonating a doctor, Gambrelli gains access to Hans hideout and clumsy attempts to treat the injured Hans, who soon sees through Gambrelli's charade and has him locked up with the princess.  Hans decides to move his safe house out of France and to Lugash, and sends his men to kill Gambrelli by placing him in a van and rolling it down a steep road off a cliff, but Gambrelli manages to escape. Seeking help, Gambrelli travels to Paris to look up Clouseau's old friends and soon meets his late father's former manservent Cato Fong ([[Burt Kwouk]]) who directs him to Inspector Clouseau's former costumer Professor Auguste Balls ([[Graham Stark]]) to assist them with making new disguises for themselves to travel to Lugash to rescue Princess Yasmin. Gambrelli and Cato fly to Lugash where they meet a government agent at a local restaurant to point them the location of Hans' new hideout.  While being followed by the Lugash Army, as well as Cato, Gambrelli ventures to a castle located outside the Lugash capital city where in a climatic gun battle, Gambrelli gains access to the castle with the assistance of the army and after confronting Hans and his henchmen, defeats them, with a little of Cato's help and rescues Princess Yasmin.  After returning to France, Gambrelli is promoted to detective and transfers to Paris' metro police force as a full Police Inspector. He attends the wedding of Maria and Dreyfus whom have gotten engaged during their time together while Dreyfus recuperated at the hospital. During the reception, Dreyfus is uncomfortably shocked when Gambrelli's twin sister Jacqueline Gambrelli ([[Nicoletta Braschi]]) appears and who turns out to be just a clumsy and dim-witted as her brother, as Maria tells Dreyfus that she in fact had twins from her one-time tryst with Inspector Clouseau.  The final scene has Inspector Gambrelli attending a ceremony in Lugash attended by King Haroak and Princess Yasmin who award him with a special medal for his rescue of Yasmin which is attended by Maria, Dreyfus, Cato, Prof. Balls and Jacqueline Gambrelli where his clumsy antics disrupt the proceedings just like his father's Inspector Clouseau's antics used to do in previous Pink Panther films. Gambrelli closes the film with the line: "That felt good!" following by the image of Gambrelli freezing as the animated Pink Panther walks across the still of Jacques, until an animated Gambrelli suddenly cuts away the head of live-action Gambrelli and pops out of the hole, dropping the head on the Panther's foot; the enraged Panther chases him into fading blackness.

 In August 1942, German soldiers enjoy leave in [[Cervo, Liguria]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] after fighting in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]]. An assembly is then held and several of the men are awarded medals, including [[Unteroffizier]] Manfred "Rollo" Rohleder (Jochen Nickel) and [[Obergefreiter]] Fritz Reiser ([[Dominique Horwitz]]), who are both introduced to [[Leutnant]] Hans von Witzland ([[Thomas Kretschmann]]), their new platoon commander. The unit is promptly sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] to participate in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].  Witzland's platoon joins a company commanded by [[Hauptmann]] Hermann Musk ([[Karel Heřmánek]]). Musk leads an assault on a factory, which results in heavy casualties and the survivors being surrounded in a decrepit building. After a botched ceasefire to rescue some wounded outside, they capture Kolya, a young Russian boy. The Russians attack again the next day, and Kolya escapes in the confusion. With the radio not working, von Witzland, Reiser, Rollo, Emigholtz ([[Heinz Emigholz]]), "GeGe" Müller (Sebastian Rudolph) and Wölk (Zdenek Vencl) enter the sewers to go for help. Witzland gets separated from the others and captures a Russian soldier named Irina ([[Dana Vávrová]]), who offers to lead him to safety, but instead she pushes him into the water and escapes. His men rescue him, and Emigholtz is found severely wounded by an explosive trap; they take him to a crowded [[aid station]], where Reiser forces an orderly at gunpoint to work on him. Emigholtz dies anyway, and they are arrested by Hauptmann Haller (Dieter Okras), who has already clashed with von Witzland. They end up in a [[Strafbattalion|penal battalion]] disarming [[land mine]]s.  Four weeks later, a brutal winter has set in and the [[Operation Uranus|Soviets have surrounded the German Sixth Army]]. Hauptmann Musk thus reassigns the penal battalion – which includes disgraced fellow officer Otto ([[Sylvester Groth]]) – to combat duty. Witzland's platoon defends a position from a Russian tank column, and emerge victorious after a bloody battle (during which Wölk is killed). Hauptman Haller later orders von Witzland and his men to execute some unarmed civilians, including Kolya, whom Witzland tries to save but to no avail.   Witzland, GeGe, and Reiser decide to desert and head towards [[Pitomnik Airfield]] in hopes of catching a plane back to Germany, stealing medical tags from some dead bodies along the way to feign being wounded. By the time they arrive, the last transport leaves without them as the base is shelled by Russian artillery. They rejoin the others in the shelter, where they find Musk suffering from severe [[trench foot]]. A German aircraft suddenly drops a container full of supplies, and the men rush out to devour its contents. Haller appears and holds them at gunpoint, but is quickly subdued; he accidentally shoots GeGe as he falls, killing him. Haller then pleads for his life, telling them about the supplies he is hoarding in a nearby house before being executed by Otto.  In the house's cellar they find shelves stocked full of food and liquor, and Irina tied to a bed. Von Witzland cuts Irina free and befriends her; she reveals she was a German collaborator, and both share in their despair and disillusionment. As the rest of the men gorge themselves, a deluded and dying Musk tries to rally them to rejoin the fighting. Otto becomes hysterical and commits suicide. Rollo, the only one to obey the order, is last seen carrying Musk's corpse outside, only to find the Sixth Army surrendering to the Russians.   Irina offers to help Witzland and Reiser avoid capture, but while trudging through the snow they are shot at by the Soviets; Irina is killed and Witzland is mortally wounded. The Germans get away, but Witzland eventually becomes too weak and dies in Reiser's arms. Reiser cradles his body, reflecting on his time spent in North Africa before freezing to death.  
Splitting Heirs
 The film centres on the [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] family of the Dukes of Bournemouth ([[England]]), upon which misfortune has fallen throughout history, leading its members to believe the family is cursed. The most recent heir, Thomas Henry Butterfly Rainbow Peace, was left in a restaurant as an infant in the 1960s; by the time his parents remembered him, he had disappeared.  Meanwhile, in the 1990s Tommy Patel has grown up in an Asian/Indian family in [[Southall]], never doubting his ethnicity despite being taller than anyone else in the house, fair-haired, blue-eyed, light-skinned—and not liking curry. From the family corner shop he commutes to the City where he works for the Bournemouth family's stockbroking firm, handling multimillion-pound deals.  Tommy is given the job of acting as host to the visiting American representative of the firm, Henry Bullock, who turns out to be the son of the head of the firm, the present Duke. They become friends and the friendship survives Henry becoming the new Duke when his father dies. Circumstantial evidence shows that the true Bournemouth heir is actually Tommy; we see a series of family portraits each of which captures something of Tommy's facial characteristics, and his Indian mother tells him the story of his adoption. He consults the lawyer who dealt with his adoption, Raoul P. Shadgrind, who says Tommy has no hope of proving his claim, but plants the idea of him obtaining his rightful place in the family by getting Henry out of the way; Shadgrind himself then engineers a variety of 'accidents' in the belief that he will share in the spoils as Tommy's partner. The delightfully-complicated love interest comes with Tommy's and Henry's (shared at the same time) lover, later the new Duchess and their (shared at different times) mother, the dowager Duchess. As befits a classical comedy of errors, the final resolution of everyone's doubts and misconceptions leaves everyone living "happily ever after - "well, for a bit, at least..."  
Speak Up! It's So Dark
 An elderly [[Jewish]] man ([[Etienne Glaser]]) befriends a young [[neo-nazi]] ([[Simon Norrthon]]) on a train and invites him to his home. Through a series of discussions the two gradually come to understand each other better.  
Sparrow (1993 film)
 In cholera-ridden Sicily of 1854, Maria, a future nun is evacuated from her convent home in [[Catania]] to her father's [[Mount Etna]] shadowed villa. During her stay she falls in love with Nino, a family friend. But things fall apart when Catania is declared safe for her to return to, meaning she must renounce her love and concentrate on serving God.

He manages to get his king's prestigious Knife Nandikanta Potaraju Katari, which was taken away by Lingamanedu ruler of Devarakonda in return for his literary prowess. Srinatha marries another poet Potana's sister Sridevi.  
Striking Distance
 Thomas Hardy, a [[Pittsburgh Police]] homicide detective, has broken the ranks by informing on his partner and cousin, Jimmy Detillo, for using excessive force. On route to the Policemen's Ball with his father, Vincent Hardy, the ball is postponed after a call indicating a [[serial killer]] nicknamed the ''[[Polish Hill (Pittsburgh)|Polish Hill]] Strangler'' has been spotted. As Tom and Vince pursue the killer's vehicle, the vehicles collide and both roll down an embankment. When Tom regains consciousness, he learns his father has been shot dead and the killer has escaped. Police arrest a criminal named Douglas Kesser as the Strangler. Later, rather than go to prison, Jimmy climbs to the top of the [[31st Street Bridge]] and jumps off. His body is never found.  Two years later, Tom is drinking heavily and has been reassigned to the River Rescue Squad. His cousin Danny, Jimmy's brother, has stepped down from the force and also drinks heavily. Called to the scene of a body dump, Tom finds the victim is an ex-girlfriend. Tom is assigned a new partner, Jo Christman, who learns from District Attorney Frank Morris that Tom had been demoted after telling a television reporter that he believed the Polish Hill Strangler was a policeman.  A nurse is abducted. Tom receives a phone call similar to ones left by the Polish Hill Strangler: the nurse screams before she is shot and the phone goes dead. Detective Eddie Eiler, who hates Tom for turning in Jimmy, states on TV the murder was committed by a copycat. Tom is met with strong opposition by his uncle, Captain Nick Detillo, after suggesting the Strangler is back. Tom goes to the precinct and steals the Strangler file in order to conduct an unauthorized investigation. Soon after, the body of another of Tom's ex-girlfriends is found.  Tom is invited to the Policemen's Ball by Jo as she is not familiar with any other officers there.  Despite understanding that he won't be very welcome, which he initially isn't, Tom goes and accompanies Jo.  Tom and Jo then join the Hardys (who represent a large portion of the officers present). Nick and Danny arrive and Danny is already drunk.  Danny has an outburst while a toast is being proposed to Vince and a fight ensues between Tom and Eddie.  Jo takes Tom home and after in initial fit from Tom the two partners kiss and then proceed to have sex while being observed by an unseen person.  The next night on patrol, Tom and Jo stumble upon the scene of someone dumping what appears to be a wrapped body off a bridge. Tom destroys the suspect's car but the unidentified individual escapes. Divers retrieve the body only to find it to be merely a bunch of rugs, which leads to Tom and Jo being humiliated by their peers.  While Jo stumbles upon Tom's investigation notes of the Stangler, Eiler informs Nick he suspects Tom. Nick discloses Tom has been under scrutiny by [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]]. During a court hearing to have Tom removed from the force, it is revealed Jo is really Emily Harper of the [[Pennsylvania State Police]], who has been monitoring Tom to find evidence of misconduct. Harper [[Perjury|perjures]] herself and Tom goes unpunished.   Emily is kidnapped from her apartment just as Tom finds the body of another female victim, a police dispatcher he knows, outside his boathouse. Thinking that Danny is the killer & angry about Jimmy's death, Tom heads upriver to the Detillo family cabin. Just as Danny arrives, someone from behind knocks Tom unconscious. Tom awakens to find himself, Danny, and Emily handcuffed to chairs, with the killer, who turns out to be none other than Jimmy, who survived the fall into the river two years earlier, standing in front of them.  Jimmy is about to kill Emily when Nick suddenly walks in and he tells his son to turn himself in, but Jimmy is defiant and commands Nick to tell how Vince really died.  A flashback reveals Nick arrived on the scene immediately after Tom and the Strangler crashed their cars. He was horrified to find Jimmy and let him escape. Vince emerged from the wrecked car and took aim at the fleeing killer, unaware it was Jimmy. Nick tried to stop him and, in the ensuing struggle, accidentally killed Vince.  After this revelation, Jimmy takes aim at Nick, who shoots first.  Jimmy is wearing a bulletproof vest and returns fire, killing his father. In a fit of rage, Danny charges at Jimmy, giving Tom a chance to free himself. As the police close in, Jimmy flees on a motorboat with Tom in pursuit. The two get into a scuffle in which Tom kills Jimmy by tasering him in the mouth. After Tom is escorted by a paramedic, an officer attempts to remove the handcuffs from Tom's wrists, but Eiler steps in to remove them, and apologizes.  In the process, he offers Tom to punch him in the face, which Tom briefly declines and after a second of reluctance, he punches Eiler in the face. Afterwards, Tom and Emily embrace each other.  The movie ends with Tom, who has been reinstated as a detective, visiting his father's grave with Emily and her daughter at his side.  
The Strategy of the Snail
 The film starts with news reporter Jose Antonio Pupo (played by [[Carlos Vives]]) interviewing a man after the movie events had taken place. This gentleman, who is also a [[leasehold estate|tenant]], reveals to the journalist how the physical house where the tenants lived for so many years was taken to a different place by rudimentary but ingenious means.The man's story in interwoven with the depiction of the events.   The building is an old one and it is home to different kinds of people. All of them are humble and from diverse backgrounds. They are told to leave the house because its owner, a  obnoxious, rich man from Bogotá's exclusive area, has new plans for it. The tenants are confronted with the authorities who are trying to evict everyone from the building. Then, the tenants decide to take a stand by locking doors and shooting at the policemen who try to carry out their orders.  After this confrontation the tenants are given more time so everyone in the house has enough time to find a new place to live. The tenants are legally represented by "Perro" Romero (Frank Ramirez)(who is extremely annoyed by anyone using the nickname "Perro" meaning dog). Romero is a man with some academic background and has the means to deal with the authorities and Dr. Holguin's (the house owner) lawyers.  Dr. Holguin uses dirty tricks to create pressure on Romero to the extent that he is kidnapped and beaten by Dr. Holguin's men. Meanwhile, at the building, Jacinto (Fausto Cabrera), an intellectual and rebellious Spaniard, devices a way to remove everything inside the house (walls, windows, bathtubs, kitchens, toilets, roofs, etc.) and have all of it moved to a piece of land located on the hills of western Bogotá. Jacinto shows "Perro" Romero how it can be done by the use of a rope and [[pulley]], which he does by demonstrating him how the pulleys and ropes are used in theatrical stages to lift very heavy weights. He does this on the stage of the Colon theater.  Jacinto is able to convince the rest of the tenants so everyone becomes a team player and helps in the construction of a tall wooden tower that would help move everything to another house couple of blocks away.   As the house is being dismantled by the tenants Misia Triana (actress Delfina Guido) accidentally finds the silhouette of [[virgin Mary]] on a wall. Misia Triana, a very religious lady who was the fiercest opponent of Jacinto's project, finally agrees with the condition of having the virgin moved first.  After going through a series of events and hazards the tenants are able to remove all the insides of the house, but in order to gain more time, Romero tells Dr. Holguin's lawyer Victor Honorio Mosquera (Humberto Dorado) that the tenants wanted to paint the house as a way to apologize for any inconvenience they might have caused, to which Mosquera agrees.  As the deadline approaches, the tenants have removed everything inside the house and have moved it to the hills by using horse-drawn wagons, informally known in Bogotá as ''zorras''. By the time lawyers, policemen and Dr. Holguin himself eagerly approach the house to witness that the tenants have actually left they are surprised by a huge explosion and the collapsing of the house's facade. After the dust and debris have dissipated they find a house painted in a wall with a graffiti style writing superimposed that reads "AHÍ TIENEN SU HIJUEPUTA CASA PINTADA" -- "Here's your motherfucking painted house."   The movie goes back again to news reporter Jose interviewing the man who is finally upset by a reporter's question and so he leaves the scene. Finally the tenants are shown gathered in one of the hills with a panoramic view of Bogotá and a [[Colombian flag]] can be seen waving.  
Street Knight
 Jake Barrett ([[Jeff Speakman]]) is a former cop who retired from the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] following an incident where he failed to save a young hostage from a disturbed criminal. This incident has haunted him for the past several years, and he now works repairing cars at a garage once owned by his father.  The city, which has been the battleground for a conflict between [[street gangs]] the Latin Lords and Blades, is currently under a tenuous truce negotiated by the heads of the two gangs. A group of Latin Lords members drive to a meeting supposedly arranged by Blades leader "8-Ball," where they are ambushed by criminals led by James Franklin ([[Christopher Neame]]). All of them are killed by Franklin except for their driver, Carlos Sanchez (Richard Coca), who flees. Franklin stages the scene of the crime to look like the Blades carried out the killings.  A friend informs Barrett of a woman who needs his help. He meets with her and learns that she is Carlos's sister Rebecca ([[Jennifer Gatti]]). She tells him that Carlos has been missing for the two days since the shooting and asks for his help, but he initially refuses, telling her that he no longer does police work. Meanwhile, several more killings are carried out by Franklin's group as they search for Carlos. Each of the victims is a member of one of the two gangs, and their murders are carefully staged to implicate the opposing gang in each case. As a result, tension between the gangs begins rising.  Barrett meets with Latin Lords leader Cisco ([[Ramón Franco]]) and later 8-Ball (Richard Allen) and asks both gangs for time to investigate the case, having become suspicious after reviewing evidence from the first shootings. He then meets with Rebecca and agrees to help her, before asking his friend Raymond ([[Bernie Casey]]), a forensics expert, for help. However, Franklin discovers Barrett's involvement in the case and sends two men to kill him. Barrett successfully kills the two before delivering their bodies to Raymond for identification.  As a result of the staged killings, the Blades and Latin Lords are about to go to war. Barrett asks for a meeting with 8-Ball, but before they can meet, one of Franklin's men disguised as Barrett guns him down at a strip club. Raymond is also killed after Franklin learns of him through a [[wiretap]] on Barrett's phone, but before he dies, he passes a disk containing the results of his analysis to Barrett. Now a wanted man, Barrett acts on information from Rebecca and finds Carlos at an observatory, taking him into protective custody. However, Franklin learns of Rebecca and abducts her, then sends information to Barrett demanding he trade Carlos for her. Barrett discovers that the criminals are corrupt cops led by Franklin, who is an ex-[[Special Forces]] soldier. He drops Carlos off at a safehouse before going to the abandoned rail yard described in the demand, but Carlos secretly follows.  With the police sufficiently distracted, Franklin and his men enact their plan to rob a jewelry store of precious [[diamonds]]. After stealing the diamonds they frame the heist as the deed of the Latin Lords before heading to the rail yard. Barrett informs the investigating officer, Lt. Bill Crowe ([[Lewis Van Bergen]]) of the rail yard before going there himself. He battles Franklin's gang, but is unaware that the Latin Lords and Blades are present and giving him aid. He confronts Franklin, who has Rebecca as a hostage, duplicating the situation from years ago that caused Barrett to quit the force. When Barrett puts down his gun, Franklin releases Rebecca and opens fire, but Barrett uses a hidden gun to shoot back. After they fight with hand to hand combat, Rebecca returns Barrett's gun to him, allowing him to open fire and kill Franklin.  In the aftermath, Barrett's name is cleared. The Blades and Latin Lords, who were informed of the truth by Carlos, lay down their grudges against each other. Carlos and Rebecca are reunited, and they leave together with Barrett, who has become Rebecca's love interest. Before leaving, Barrett is told by Crowe that the department is willing to reinstate him, to which Barrett says "I'll think about it."  
Stepmonster
 The movie starts off with art supplies and dramatic music. The art supplies draw an [[EC Comics]] knockoff that the camera zooms into, showing a family vacation.  The family sees a "No Hunting" sign that seemingly says you can only hunt monsters called "tropopkins", and the kid of the family, Todd ([[Billy Corben]]), just happens to have a comic detailing what a tropopkin is. Todd's mom Abby ([[Molly Cheek]]) has a weird sense of humor and suggests that the sign could mean only tropopkins are allowed to hunt.  Almost instantly the roar of a tropopkin is heard. Todd doesn't see the tropopkin, but he does find a giant chicken-like footprint, which matches the tropopkin footprint in his comic. Just then a random sexy woman appears. Right off the bat she's extremely suspicious, and seems to be flirting with Todd's dad George ([[Alan Thicke]]), who's humorless, irritating, super-serious, and he seems to be like a generic grumpy 1950s dad. Also pages from the comic are shown throughout the film, which happen to detail what's going on. The monster appears, and wraps up Abby in a cocoon. 6 months later, Todd, sadly, is living with his grandparents Shirley and Norman ([[Alice Hirson]] and [[George Gaynes]]) after the incident, and they all, except Todd, believe the mother is dead.  In the meantime, George has hooked up with Denise Gore ([[Robin Riker]]), the suspicious sexy woman from earlier. Todd didn't know they were dating. Even Todd's grandparents end up chewing George out. It is believed George had been dating Denise for 6 months, and for that entire time Todd got left with his grandparents. We get a short little heartwarming scene between the kid and his grandpa Norman, filled with random sports metaphors, in the style of Sisko from [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]], how everything is like baseball, or how everything ties into baseball.  There's some more random suspiciousness with Denise, as Todd sees her gnawing on a bone, as Todd saw a tropopkin do the same thing in that magical comic book that details various things we've seen before. Also Denise has some tiny creature in a box she talks to, and feeds it a live goldfish. George comes in, notices a missing fish automatically, and blames Todd for it. The scene cuts to Todd being a peeping tom and watching his neighbor Wendy ([[Ami Dolenz]]) strip down. This ties into the plot, because Todd catches Denise eyeing a jogger at night. She flirts with some fat, bald, middleaged jogger (Mark Barbolak) who follows her, steps in a gooey dog mess leftover from a pet dog she seemingly ate, doesn't find this suspicious at all, and continues following her. The jogger seemingly finds a half eaten dog with her shoe, and he doesn't find this at all suspicious, and off-camera, Denise eats the jogger.  The next morning, the newspaper headline states "Jogger Found Dead", presumed to have been eaten by a dog. The parents decide to go out, and then hire a babysitter, which happened to be Wendy, the neighbor that Todd was peeping on earlier. The movie has the [[Cassandra]] complex--the cliché where someone spends most of a movie telling the whole truth and nothing but, and nobody believes them.  Wendy's boyfriend "Phlegm" ([[Corey Feldman]]) comes in, and he and Wendy have a date, much to Todd's dismay.  Phlegm turns out to be smart. He explains about how Denise is waiting on the [[summer solstice]] to eat George, Phlegm knows this because he also reads comic books. It happens the summer solstice is the same day as the wedding.  The next night, Denise is following a young paperboy (Eric Mettner) around, but this time Todd is there to watch her become her monstrous form. Todd watches her eat the little kid alive, tries to take photos for evidence that he wasn't just reading too many comic books about monsters, and runs off.  Denise revealed she hates violin music, as George repeatedly tells Todd to practice the violin. Over, and over, and over.  Todd gets the photos developed and shows them to his neighbor/babysitter without looking at them. They all seem to be photos from when he was peeping on her, as the ones of Denise in her real form, sadly, came out in nothing but fuzz.  Todd later that day found out the thing Denise keeps in her box is a giant bat-like monster. Todd goes after it with a baseball bat, breaks a bunch of things in the process, and as you'd expect, gets in trouble with his dad over it.  He tells George, his dad, that the bat-like thing is called a harpy, and that harpies help tropopkins. George just gets angry, grounds Todd, and throws away his comics. George goes off to leave Todd alone with Denise. Due to this, Todd runs off to tell his grandfather all about tropopkins, but of course, his grandfather doesn't believe him. We then get a montage of the evil monster forcing Todd to do chores. Todd suddenly gets the idea to make a big trap to catch Denise in her monster form. Predictably, she turns back into a human the second George comes back.   Todd gets taken to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Emmerson ([[Edie McClurg]]). He tells Dr. Emmerson the whole truth and nothing but, and she predictably ignores it all and assumes that he's just exaggerating things and that the two would get along if Todd gave her a chance. Denise is then sent to go see Dr. Emmerson, and predictably, she turns into her tropopkin form and eats her, destroying evidence that Todd knew what he was talking about.  Todd's grandpa takes him out to a comic shop run by a flamboyant, cleanfreak [[Spock]]-like guy ([[Sean Whalen]]), and they look for a comic on tropopkins so Todd can find out how to defeat them. Sadly, the comic is $500, being a collector's copy.  Todd then seemingly goes to peep on Wendy again, but sees Denise going after her. He goes to warn her, sees her in her underwear, she freaks out as you'd expect, but then the monster bursts through her door. Thankfully it freaks out when its covered by a blanket, and then runs away. At least now someone believes Todd.  Todd has a plan: to get a loan on his violin to buy the $500 comic--only to gain the defeating information and simply return the comic and pay the [[pawnbroker]] right back, but Todd's dad George caught Todd in the act, got angry and threatened to throw the comic book away. Upon finding out he got a loan on the violin, he angrily and rashly ripped up the $500 comic into tiny shreds. Todd and Wendy then find all but the piece of the comic book that reveals the monster's one weakness--just what Todd needed.  It's the wedding day, and we get a shot of Denise, in monster form, in her wedding dress, using a deep voice--her real voice, which George doesn't find suspicious for more than a split second. At the same time, Todd waxes the steps, hoping Denise will fall.  All is not well, as Denise falls down the steps and...is completely fine.  The minister ([[John Astin]]) pronounces George and Denise man and wife.  Thankfully, by coincidence, the kid manages to find the piece of the comic with the weakness: It turns out the weakness is violin music! (That's why Denise hates the violin!)  Todd got his [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] recording of violin music, and Phlegm brought a bunch of [[Marshall amps]] to make the music loud to defeat the monster. Todd's grandfather now believes him, as he's there helping to blare the violin music to defeat the monster. George finally witnesses his wife transform. She doesn't kill him though, only knocks him out with a wine bottle before running outside and being incapacitated by the violin music.  But it's a trick! She gets back up, goes after Todd, and her harpy comes to destroy the cords that connect the amps, stopping the violin music and wrecking the cassette--a [[Deus ex machina]].  Just then George comes around, comes out with a violin (George paid the loan back), and plays it at the monster. The grandfather's non-sequitor baseball reference earlier turns out to be useful, as the kid ends up killing the harpy with it.  The violin music kills Denise, and she disintegrates to nothing.  Todd and his dad make-up.  The next day, also to make-up, they go hiking in the area from the beginning of the film, and find Denise's cave, complete with cocoons where Denise stored food for the winter. Todd and his dad free the victims from the cocoons, as the 3rd and final cocoon happened to be...Todd's mom Abby, a-okay! The film ends as the family's happily together again, and altogether going on a hike.   <ref>[http://www.allmovie.com/work/stepmonster-46838 allmovie website]</ref>

Unable to fix the flooding, Luigi and Daisy rush back to his apartment where they inform Mario about the incident. The trio returns to the flooding where the Mario Bros. manage to fix it but are knocked unconscious by Iggy and Spike, who proceed to capture Daisy.  Moments later, Mario and Luigi awaken and head deeper into the caves following Daisy's screams and discover an interdimensional portal allowing the Mario Bros. to follow Daisy. It turns out that Iggy and Spike are henchmen (and cousins) of the other world's germophobic and obsessive–compulsive dictator, [[Bowser (character)|King Koopa]], who descended from the [[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus Rex]]. Iggy and Spike realize they didn't bring Daisy's rock, a meteorite fragment which Koopa is trying to get in order to merge his world with the human world. It is then revealed that Daisy is the long-lost Princess of the other dimension. When Koopa overthrew Daisy's father (and devolved him into fungus), her mother took her to Brooklyn using the interdimensional portal. The portal was then closed, with Daisy's mother killed in the process, but Scapelli's men inadvertently reopened the portal when they blasted the cave. Upon hearing this, Koopa sends Spike and Iggy to find both Daisy and the rock to merge the dimensions and make him dictator of both worlds. However, after Koopa subjects them to one of his experiments to make them more intelligent, Spike and Iggy realize Koopa's evil intentions and side with the Mario Bros. in the desert. Daisy is taken to Koopa-Tower, where she meets a young [[Yoshi]]. Koopa informs Daisy that she descended from the dinosaurs, believing only Daisy can merge the worlds because of her royal heritage. Eventually, the Mario Bros. rescue Daisy with the help of Toad, a good-natured guitarist who was punished by Koopa for performing music that protests his reign (for which he is devolved into a Goomba).  Eventually, the two worlds merge and Koopa devolves Scapelli into a chimpanzee before going after Mario, but Luigi and Daisy manage to remove the fragment from the meteorite and the worlds separate again. In Dinohattan, Mario confronts Koopa and eventually defeats him when he and Luigi fire their devolution guns at Koopa and blast him with a Bob-omb. Koopa, now transformed into a ferocious, semi-humanoid Tyrannosaurus attempts to kill the Mario Bros., but they destroy him once and for all by transforming him into an actual [[T. rex]], which is too intense for him to live through and instead turns him into [[Primordial soup|primeval slime]]. With Daisy's father restored after Koopa's defeat, he reclaims control over the kingdom. The citizens celebrate and immediately destroy anything under Koopa's influence. Luigi professes his love for Daisy and wants her to come to Brooklyn with him, but Daisy cannot come until the damage caused by Koopa is repaired and thus, she wants to spend more time with her father. Heartbroken, Luigi kisses Daisy goodbye as he and Mario return home to Brooklyn, with Daisy watching them leave. Three weeks later, the Mario Bros. are getting ready for dinner when their story comes on the news and the anchorman says they should be called the "Super Mario Bros." Daisy then arrives and asks the Mario Bros. to help her and says, "You're never gonna believe this!"  In a [[post-credits scene]], two Japanese business executives propose making a video game based on Iggy and Spike, who decide on the title ''The Super Koopa Cousins''.  
Surf Ninjas
 Johnny and Adam are teenage surfers who live in Los Angeles with their father, Mac. Two weeks before Johnny's 16th birthday, ninjas attack the teenagers, but they are defeated by Zatch, a mysterious warrior with an eye patch. A follow-up attack results in Mac's kidnapping, though Zatch is able to protect the teenagers and their friend Iggy from the ninjas. Adam discovers that the video game on his [[Sega Game Gear]] matches the events happening around him and finds he can control some events through his Sega.  Zatch reveals to Johnny and Adam that they are actually the sons of the king of [[Patusan]], whose land and monarchy was overthrown by the evil Colonel Chi when the boys were young. It is their destiny to return to Patusan, overthrow Colonel Chi, and free the people. Zatch takes them to the Patusani district in Los Angeles, where Johnny is introduced to a Patusani princess, Ro-May, who has been betrothed to Johnny since they were infants.  Ninjas again attack, but Johnny's abilities as a warrior prince emerge and he defeats several of his foes. Johnny, Adam, Iggy, Zatch, and Ro-May decide to return to Patusan. They are followed by a Los Angeles detective, Lieutenant Spence, who had been investigating the ninja attacks. They reach Patusan and discover what Colonel Chi's rule has wrought, including a burned village and a chain gang of political prisoners. The guards spot them and they are forced to fight. Johnny and Adam defeat them and free the villagers from their captivity.  Zatch leads the crew to a hidden cave in which the ancient weapons of the Patusani monarchy are preserved. Zatch arms Johnny and attacks him to prepare him for future challenges. Johnny is beaten repeatedly, but he is finally able to disarm Zatch. They rally the villagers and they travel to the coast opposite from an island that houses the royal city and Colonel Chi's dungeon. Unable to go by boat due to an impassable reef, Johnny and Adam tell the Patusanis to make surfboards. They then paddle to the unguarded side of the island.  Landing on the island, Johnny and Zatch lead the attack on the royal city, taking down Chi's henchmen and freeing Mac. During the battle, Zatch is revealed to be the boys' paternal uncle.  Johnny confronts Colonel Chi, successfully defeating him by knocking him into a body of water with the help of Adam and his Game Gear. With Chi's rule undone, peace is restored to Patusan. Johnny is seated as the heralded warrior prince with Ro-May as his princess and Adam as a prince. Johnny declares the monarchy to be dissolved and announces that Patusan will operate as a democracy. His reason for doing this is for the people to finally be free of rule, good or evil.

Super Hornio Brothers
 ===''Super Hornio Brothers''=== Programmer Squeegie Hornio (Ron Jeremy), based on Luigi, and his brother Ornio Hornio (T.T. Boy), based on Mario, are [[Teleportation in fiction|teleported]] into Squeegie's in-development [[PC game]] after a freak power overload. After regaining their bearings, Squeegie figures out and explains to Ornio that they are stuck in the black void of a [[computer monitor]] when it's turned off. A [[computer virus]] informs the brothers that King Pooper (Buck Adams), based on [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] (also known as King Koopa), has kidnapped Princess Perlina (Chelsea Lynx), based on [[Princess Peach]]. King Pooper intends on forcefully having Perlina help him travel to Earth with a tub full of [[semen]] energized by a special [[Wikt:generator|generator]].  Squeegie and Ornio travel through the computer world, encountering other [[villain]]s who attempt to delay them and hamper their efforts. Squeegie is temporarily separated from his brother in the process. Finding King Pooper's lair first, Squeegie attempts to free Princess Perlina, only to be found by King Pooper. Attempting to fight King Pooper alone, Squeegie is about to lose when Ornio reappears and shoves King Pooper into the tub, where he melts and dies. The brothers ask Princess Perlina to teleport them back to Earth, but Perlina only transports herself and Ornio back, leaving Squeegie behind in the cyberworld. Attempting to manipulate the generator to get back to the real world, Squeegie is confronted and appears to be captured by a revived King Pooper.  ===''Super Hornio Brothers II''=== After a lengthy recap of the first installment, Princess Perlina and Ornio teleport back to Squeegie's office. Wondering where Squeegie is, Ornio is distracted by Princess Perlina offering sex as a reward for saving her from King Pooper. After [[sexual intercourse]], Ornio asks Perlina to bring Squeegie back to the real world. The teleportation goes horribly wrong; Perlina teleports both Squeegie and King Pooper just as King Pooper confronts Squeegie at the generator seen at the end of ''Super Hornio Brothers''. King Pooper escapes, and he begins to enact his ultimate goal, bluntly explained by Perlina to the Hornio Brothers as to "[[procreate]] and create more King Pooper offspring." While King Pooper hires a [[prostitute]] to start his plan, Squeegie theorizes that the generator is the key to King Pooper's scheme and draws up plans to destroy it.  Mimicking what they did the first time around, Squeegie and Ornio teleport back into the computer. Guided by the computer virus, Ornio distracts a hooker, which allows Squeegie and the computer virus to go back to King Pooper's lair. Squeegie comes up with a plan to thwart King Pooper by having the computer virus "overload" the generator and knock it out. The computer virus [[Non-penetrative sex|rubs his body]] against the machine, causing it to overload. Squeegie explains to Ornio and Princess Perlina back in the real world that by overloading the generator, King Pooper is now in "a state of limbo" and won't cause any more trouble. Ecstatic, Princess Perlina embraces and hugs Ornio while ignoring Squeegie. A spurned Squeegie [[fourth wall|turns to the camera]] and says that he expected the film to end this way.

Tai Chi Master (film)
 [[Zhang Sanfeng|Junbao]] and Tienbo grow up together in a [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin Temple]] as monks, studying the [[martial arts]] and generally getting into trouble. They are both expelled from the temple after Tienbo almost kills a fellow student who cheats in a fight against him. Aided in their escape by their sympathetic teacher, they receive final instructions regarding the potential paths of their different personalities, with a specific warning given to Tienbo.  Junbao and Tienbo then go into the outside world to find their way in life. Meanwhile, a gang of henchmen are forcibly taking money from a local shop owner. A woman named Miss Li steals the money and returns it. Having noticed the money gone, the henchmen start to fight with Miss Li. Miss Li holds her own during the fight, but soon gets into a bit of trouble due to her being outnumbered. Junbao comes to her aid and defeats the gang. Army reinforcements arrive to break up the fight and so the trio run away to escape capture. At this moment the [[eunuch]] governor travels through the town, roughing up the locals as he does so. Tienbo realizes that he wants to be as rich and powerful as the governor, but Miss Li warns him that the governor has "the heart of a viper" and wonders if he could handle this power. Miss Li then shows them to a pub to get food.  Inside the pub, they find a woman named Siu-lin. Siu-lin is searching for her lost husband, during which she supports herself by playing on a [[sanxian]] that said husband gave to her as a gift. She finds him inside the pub as the new husband of the governor's niece. The niece starts a battle with Siu-lin where they both seem equal, but the husband hits Siu-lin on her head with a stool causing her to collapse. Junbao helps Siu-lin by defending her against her ex-husband and the niece's guards.  The next day, while Junbao and Tienbo are making money with their amazing [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] skills, the governor's second in command spots them and is impressed with Tienbo's abilities (and his eagerness to kow-tow to authority). He offers him a position in the army, which Tienbo readily accepts. However, Junbao is more reluctant to do so and declines going with Tienbo, and so the two go their separate ways.  Later, some soldiers come to the pub to collect taxes (which have increased due to the governor’s greedy nature), but Junbao and the rebels (who have stolen great valuables from the governor to give back to the poor) fight and kill them one by one. One soldier escapes alive and starts off towards the army's camp to warn them about the rebels with Junbao in pursuit. Just in front of the army encampment, Tienbo kills the soldier before he warns the rest of the army about the rebels whereabouts. Tienbo warns Junbao to stay clear of the rebels as they'll get him into trouble. Now knowing where the rebels are hiding however, Tienbo takes this unique opportunity to gain a promotion. He sets a trap for Junbao and the rebels by telling them that the army is on patrol and when would be the best time to attack them.  Junbao and Siu-lin collect all the rebels from the region and go to the army camp (thus, falling for Tienbo's trap). A big battle occurs where most of the rebels die. Tienbo captures Miss Li and Siu-lin. In the end, the only survivors are Junbao and a few rebels.  Because of the trap, the governor promotes Tienbo to [[lieutenant]]. With his new authority (and some poignant advice from the governor), Tienbo kills Miss Li and holds Siu-lin as bait, so that he can try to convert Junbao to the army's cause. This is unsuccessful, and Junbao rescues her. Due to the fact that his best friend betrayed him, Junbao's mind snaps, and he goes crazy for days. While recuperating in the countryside with Siu-lin, he has a sudden epiphany that leads to him regaining his mental health and inspiration for the creation of the martial art of [[Tai chi|Tai Chi Chuan]].   While the governor is traveling to [[Beijing]] to see the empress, he encounters Junbao and Siu-lin who defeat his niece and the soldiers guarding him. With the governor captured as a hostage, they go to the army camp and demand Tienbo surrender his wealth and his power. Due to his arrogance, Tienbo declines and starts to fight Junbao, thinking that he is still the inferior fighter. To Tienbo's surprise, however, Junbao is now fighting using the heretofore unseen style of Tai Chi Chuan. Because the style relies less on size, power, speed and strength, Junbao is able to fend off Tienbo with ease. Seeking an additional advantage in their fight, Tienbo kills the governor in order to gain complete control over the troops surrounding them. Siu-lin intervenes and convinces them not to listen to Tienbo as he just betrayed their leader. Seeing this (and also the way Tienbo utilizes his troops as battle fodder), the troops back off and leave Tienbo's fate to Junbao. After a stunning series of parries and blows by Junbao, Tienbo is defeated and ultimately killed due to his reluctance to accept fate and admit defeat. After the fight, Siu-lin and Junbao go their separate ways, with Junbao returning to the Shaolin temple and establishing [[Wudang Mountains|his own school]] to teach [[T'ai chi ch'uan|Tai Chi Chuan]].

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III
  In 1593, in feudal Japan, a young man is being chased by four [[samurai]] on [[horse]]back. As they go into the woods, a mysterious woman emerges from the underbrush and watches closely. However, the samurai eventually capture and take the youth, revealed to be a prince named Kenshin, with them.  In the present, two years after the events of the previous film, [[April O'Neil]] has been shopping at the flea market in preparation for her upcoming vacation. She brings her friends gifts to cheer them up. [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]] is given an old lamp (the lampshade of which he wears as an impression of "[[Elvis Presley]] in ''[[Blue Hawaii]]''"), [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] is given a broken radio to fix, [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] is given a book on swords, and [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]] is to receive a fedora but, having stormed off earlier, he is never formally given it. For [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], she brings an ancient Japanese [[scepter]]. Back in the past, Kenshin is being scolded at by his father, Lord Norinaga, for disgracing their family name, but Kenshin argues that his father's desire for war is the true disgrace. Their argument is interrupted by Walker, an English trader who has come to supply Norinaga with added manpower and firearms, and Kenshin leaves his father's presence to brood alone in a temple. There, he finds the same scepter and reads the inscription: "Open Wide the Gates of Time".  In the present, April is looking at the scepter and it begins to light up. She is then sent back in time, while Kensin takes her place; each wears what the other did. Upon arrival, April is accused of being a witch, but Walker deduces she has no power and has April put in prison to suffer. Back in the present, Kenshin is highly distressed upon seeing the turtles and calls them "[[Kappa (folklore)|kappa]]". After learning from Kenshin of the situation, the turtles decide to go back in time to get April. However, according to Donatello's calculations, they have to do it within 60 hours, otherwise the scepter's power will disappear due to the space-time continuum being out of sync. They bring in [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]] to watch over the lair and use the scepter to warp through time. When doing so, the turtles are replaced by four of Norinaga's Honor Guards and are confused at their new surroundings.  Back in time, the turtles awake on horseback and make a poor show of riding their steeds. During the confusion, Mikey (who is carrying the scepter) ends up riding off alone into the forest and gets ambushed by an unknown assailant. The others go to search for April at Norinaga's palace, where their identity as Honor Guards allows them cover in their search. After following one of Walker's thugs into the prison, the turtles rescue April and also free another prisoner named Whit (locked up for trying to start a mutiny against Walker, and who bears a striking resemblance to Casey), but their sloppy escape ends up leaving them all alone in the wilderness and without a clue where to go. Meanwhile, in the present, Kenshin is getting impatient and anticipates a fight from Casey. Casey instead introduces him and the Honor Guards to television hockey, which manages to calm them down for the time being.  Out in the woods, the turtles, April, and Whit are again attacked, this time by villagers mistaking them for Norinaga's forces. The attack stops when Mitsu, leader of the rebellion against Lord Norinaga, unmasks Raphael and sees that he looks just like one of her prisoners. The turtles realize that she is talking about Mikey and accompany Mitsu to her village. When they arrive, the village is being burned down by Walker's men. As the turtles help the villagers save it, Mikey is let out by a pair of clueless soldiers and joins in the fight. Walker is forced to retreat, but the fire continues to burn and has trapped a young boy named Yoshi inside a house. Michelangelo saves Yoshi from the fire, then Leonardo helps him recover by performing [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]].  As Walker continues bargaining with Lord Norinaga over buying guns in exchange for gold, the turtles spend some time in the village. Donatello decides to have a replica scepter made so they can get back home, while Michaelangelo teaches some of the people about pizza and later tries to console Mitsu about Kenshin, whom she is in love with. Raphael also gets in touch with his sensitive side through the child Yoshi, and teaches Yoshi how to control his temper. Back in the present, the Honor Guards from the past are quickly adjusting to life in the 20th Century, and Casey decides to challenge them to a hockey game. To Casey's dismay, the Honor Guards think hockey is about beating up each other. Meanwhile, Kenshin and Splinter fear that the ninja turtles will not return home in time before their sixty hours are up.  In the past, the replica scepter is completed, but an argument between Michelangelo and Raphael ends up breaking it. To make matters worse, Mitsu informs them that Lord Norinaga has agreed to purchase Walker's guns and will attack the village in the morning. When Raphael sneaks off to visit Yoshi, however, he is surprised to find the original scepter in the child's possession. The turtles are overjoyed to see it but are angry at Mitsu for hiding it and essentially forcing them to fight her war, however, Mitsu's grandfather clarifies that it was ''his'' idea to have the turtles fight in her place.  Suddenly, Whit betrays everybody and captures Mitsu, and the turtles return to Norinaga's palace to save her. After rescuing her, they are cornered by Norinaga and are made to fight waves of his soldiers. The turtles respond by freeing the prisoners in the palace, starting an all-out war on the palace grounds. After a while of fighting, Leo defeats Lord Norinaga in a heated sword duel, comedically finishing him by cutting his hair and then trapping him inside of a bell. Deciding to cut his losses, Walker takes the scepter and tries to escape to his boat. When cornered by the turtles at the dock, Walker throws the scepter into the air as a distraction. The turtles catch the scepter, while Whit launches a catapult at Walker and knocks him off the dock to his death.  The turtles are now ready to return to their own time, but Mikey says he'd rather stay (in particular because he wanted to be with Mitsu). Raphael decides he wants to stay as well because he feels like the Turtles are appreciated in Japan unlike back home. The other turtles and April try to convince them otherwise until Kenshin activates the scepter and makes the decision harder. After a long debate (which included Mitsu telling Mikey to keep his promise about Kenshin returning to the past), Michelangelo reluctantly agrees to go home with his brothers, but just barely misses grabbing the scepter in time. The Honor Guards switch back with the Turtles (all except for Michelangelo). Fortunately, the last remaining Honor Guard activates the scepter and swaps places with Mikey just before the scepter burns out.  In the past, Norinaga admits surrender to Mitsu and Kenshin, and the two lovers share a tender reunion. Michaelangelo, meanwhile, is depressed over the thought of growing up, but Splinter cheers him up by performing the "lampshade Elvis" impression, and the rest of the turtles join in with a final dance number.

TC 2000 (film)
 In 2020, ecological disaster has driven the wealthy to an underground city.  Jason Storm is part of an elite security force called the Tracker-Communicators who protect the city against the surface world survivors who could not afford to escape.  Zoey Kinsella, the deceased founder's daughter, joins him as his rookie partner.  After a raid by starving surface world survivors breaches the city's force field, Zoey comes to believe they have inside help.  Storm acknowledges the possibility but is more concerned with his clashes against the Controller, the leader of the city's security, and his enforcer, Bigalow.  The Controller wants to use a  cybernetic project to replace the Tracker-Communicators, but he can not find any volunteers  Niki Picasso and his gang penetrate the underground city's force field and head directly to a disused area of the city.  There, in a hidden cache, they find ammunition and an automatic rifle, a weapon that has become extremely rare.  While Picasso pins down Storm and Kinsella, an unseen adversary shoots Kinsella dead.  Convinced of a coverup, Storm angrily resigns, only to have the Controller send Bigalow to kill him.  When Storm escapes the city, the Controller frames him for Kinsella's death and sets the security forces after him.  Unknown to Storm, the Controller has Kinsella resurrected as a cyborg and programs her to be his personal assassin.  Her first mission is to seduce Picasso and recruit him to take over a research facility guarded by the Lifers, a powerful gang.  On the surface world, Storm encounters a martial arts master, Sumai, and his daughter.  Sumai helps Storm infiltrate Picasso's lair, but the cybernetic Kinsella easily defeats Storm.  As Storm recovers, Sumai trains him.  Sumai, former head of security at the research facility, tells Storm that Kinsella's father was the person who founded it.  The facility was originally meant to counter the ecological damage but was converted into a chemical weapons factory.  Suspecting that the Controller seeks the biological weapons to take over the surface world, Storm and Sumai recruit fighters who are willing to stand up to Picasso.  As Picasso overpowers the Lifers with his rifle, the Controller murders the city's leader, the Overlord, and joins him.  After launching the chemical weapons, the Controller double-crosses Picasso.  As the Controller flees the facility, Picasso confronts and kills him, though he left trapped in a silo.

The Temp (film)
  Peter Derns ([[Timothy Hutton]]) is an executive for a cookie company. He has just been released from a clinic after being treated for paranoia and he is still in a shaky emotional state. On his first day back at work, he becomes further upset when he walks into a marketing meeting to make a new product presentation without knowing that his company has been taken over by a major food conglomerate. The company's new owners are looking to make cutbacks and Peter's whole career is riding on his new-product introduction. Peter's ruthless boss and supervisor, Charlene ([[Faye Dunaway]]), whose job is also at risk, wants a complete report by Peter on her desk no later than noon on the following day. When Peter's male personal assistant, Lance, takes off, he frets that he will never make the deadline. But to Peter's good fortune, the company assigns him a temp worker, the brunette, seductive-looking Kris Bolin ([[Lara Flynn Boyle]]).  Kris soon proves herself to Peter by solving two marketing problems with Peter's new product in short order over the next few days. Peter and Kris soon bond over their lunch breaks where Kris tells Peter about herself: she has an office-skills degree from Stanford and has a husband and young daughter. Kris, being ruthlessly efficient, brilliant and unflaggingly loyal to Peter, hopes to use her skills to become his permanent secretary. Despite Kris's possessive attitude, Peter cannot seem to do without her, nor can the rest of the office. Not only does Kris help him deliver his report to Charlene on time, she passes on credit to him for her own ideas.  However, soon various people around the office meet with unfortunate "accidents," beginning when Peter's assistant, Lance, returns the following week and, while attempting to fix a paper shredder during his first day back, is maimed when his right hand gets stuck and mutilated, forcing him to take permanent leave. Peter starts to note the deaths of some of his rivals for advancement in the company, such as Hartsell ([[Oliver Platt]]), who is found dead in his stalled car on a busy expressway after being stung by a wasp. Another few days later, Jasser ([[Dwight Schultz]]) is found in his office after hanging himself in an apparent suicide. Peter begins to suspect that Kris is responsible for these deaths, but he cannot prove it or get anyone to listen to him due to his recovering mental state. Nevertheless, the deaths of the executives lay the groundwork for Peter's own unearned promotions.  Meanwhile, Peter is determined to win back his estranged wife ([[Maura Tierney]]), and starts to distrust Kris. He refuses her advances for a romantic relationship, as well as a professional partnership, and even a simple friendship. Soon things for Peter begin to go wrong. A marketing test for Peter's new cookie product is horribly sabotaged when broken glass is added to the batter of the cookies, injuring people who test the new product out. Peter becomes more convinced that Kris is behind the mayhem, but he still cannot get anyone to listen to him because everyone around him writes off his claims as more paranoia.  Soon, Peter's paranoia begins to work against him as he starts to suspect an old friend ([[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]]), at a rival cookie company, of being behind the events. Peter also begins to suspect Charlene herself is trying to destroy his career to protect her own. Peter begins looking into Kris's past and learns that at her last temp job at a local bank, her boss, whom she may have had an affair with, died mysteriously. Peter also learns that Kris never went to Stanford, nor does she have any husband or child. Peter confronts Kris about what she may be doing behind the scenes, but she naturally denies doing anything wrong. The very next day, Peter is shunned from his job after someone frames him for leaking company information to a rival company. However, Kris comes to his aid by accepting responsibility for the "computer error", which earns Peter's promotion to vice president and Kris's promotion to marketing executive.  By the climax of the film, Peter and Kris are sent to the company's bakery on a weekend retreat, where the car in which they are both riding nearly runs off the road after someone tampers with the brakes. After checking into their hotel for the night (in separate rooms), Peter gets a message from Charlene about an emergency at the company's bakery. Upon going there, he finds a dead security guard, killed by a letter opener knife that Kris had earlier given him. Kris is also present at the bakery, but appears to be suffering from a mild concussion due to a supposed blow to her head. He enters the bakery grounds office and attempts to call for an ambulance, but someone hits him from behind and tries to finish him off, only for someone else to tackle his attacker.  In his disoriented state, Peter wanders out of the office to see Kris struggling with Charlene in a brutal fight along a catwalk. Yet it is nearly impossible to tell from Peter's point-of-view if Kris is trying to kill Charlene, or if Charlene is trying to kill Kris. Peter intervenes in the fight and Charlene falls from a plank and is left hanging from a railing. He attempts to pull her up but she slips from his grasp and falls to her death, but not before saying "The picture".  Months later, Peter works on rebuilding his relationship with his family, is made president of the company, and privately thanks Kris for saving his life. However, as he settles into Charlene's office, he glances at an open box containing some of her things that are still being cleared out, and spots four exact photos of Kris's husband and child together, each in exactly the same frame that she uses. After Charlene's secretary explains that they were a cheap gift from her to Charlene, and that the photos just came with the frames, Peter suddenly realizes what Charlene meant by her last words.  Peter theorizes that Charlene did indeed look into his earlier claims about Kris' lies and discovered that she had not only lied about her educational background, but also about having been married, having no doubt seen the photo she used. Knowing she would be fired, Kris orchestrated the incident at the bakery with the intent to kill Charlene, and possibly Peter as well.  Peter confronts Kris with this revelation, but she yet again denies everything and states that the photo is a means for single office women like her to discourage male co-workers from hitting on them. (Note: throughout the entire film, whenever Kris is caught in a lie about her past or work, she makes up a whole new lie on the spur of the moment to replace or patch up the old lie). Peter, however, refuses to believe her anymore. He is now aware that Kris is a master manipulator and [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]], but also aware that he will never be able to prove that Kris was responsible for all the deaths and incidents at the company nor will she ever admit to any wrongdoing. Peter decides to remove Kris the old fashioned way: he fires Kris and orders her detained until the police can escort her out.

She is infatuated with the girl across the street, 17-year-old Sheryl O' Connor ([[Juliette Lewis]]). She often looks at her from her bedroom window.  Alice starts to copy every detail about Sheryl, including her perfume and even the record she listens to.  She admires the affection that Sheryl's father gives her, as she doesn't receive the same from her own father.  She then tells her mother about how amazing Sheryl is but Alice's mother pays little attention.  One day she goes bowling with some of her friends and is ridiculed by them. Reeling from comments made to her, she immediately becomes excited when Sheryl walks into the bowling alley along with a group of guys trying to win her affection. Sheryl, seemingly innocent and moral, rejects their advances. Sheryl meets the counter boy named Rick ([[C. Thomas Howell|C. Thomas Howel]]<nowiki/>l). They are instantly attracted to each other. As Alice continues to bowl with her friends, she constantly watches Sheryl's every move. Her friends doubt she even knows Sheryl. Rick pages Sheryl to come back to the desk, and a police officer tells her that her father just died.  During the funeral, Sheryl is obviously upset. Afterwards she returns her bowling shoes to the bowling alley. Rick tells her they are closed, and she starts crying over her father. After some conversation, Rick walks Sheryl home, and this leads to their first kiss which is seen by Alice. The next day Rick comes back with his gang, and they take Sheryl to the beach, where they have oysters and tequila and Sheryl pours her heart out over her father's death. They spend the whole day and night together.  All is not well, however.  Sheryl's mother disapproves of the relationship between her and Rick.  Eventually, she bars her from seeing him, and the neighborhood begins to gossip.  Sheryl refuses to listen to her mother.  Sheryl babysits Alice and a friendship begins with Sheryl imparting wisdom about boys.  Alice offers help to Sheryl to sneak out and see Rick.  The three of them spend much of the night together which includes bringing Alice to seedy places like dive bars and under the boardwalk.  She also makes a record in a booth detailing everything that happened that night.    Alice continues to help Sheryl and Rick hide their relationship.  She goes to the bowling alley to explain to Rick why Sheryl couldn't see him one day.  Alice's father tells her to stay away from the older Rick.  It's revealed that Sheryl is pregnant.  Her mother decides to send her to an unwed mother's home 300 miles away.  Rick repeatedly calls Sheryl's house only to have her mother tell him not to call. Finally, he and his gang drive to her house where Rick pleads to speak to Sheryl.  This captures the attention of most of the immediate neighbors.  Her mother informs him that Sheryl is gone and he is to leave.  He refuses to believe her and pushes her aside to go into the house.  The neighborhood fathers then rush to help Ann, and a brawl ensues between Rick's gang and the neighbors.  Rick spends a week in jail and it's assumed that no serious charges were filed.  Alice becomes withdrawn from the incident and she decides to run away.  Rick finds her under the boardwalk and the two talk.  Reluctantly, Rick agrees to drive upstate with Alice to meet Sheryl at the unwed mother's home.  Alice arranges for Sheryl to sneak out at midnight to meet Rick at the restaurant.  The couple meet but Sheryl has decided that she wants to put the baby up for adoption.  She realistically can't see a life with Rick and a baby. They have no money or viable jobs.  Rick is upset and hands her an engagement ring that he suggests she pawn.  Alice then talks to Sheryl and asks her what happened to  true love.  Sheryl tells her that she is simply too young to understand.  Alice still wants the three of them to run away together.  Sheryl tells Alice that she can't leave her family.  As Alice is put on a bus back to Long Island, she stares out the window as Rick and Sheryl embrace.  Alice makes it home, and her parents are relieved to have her back.  She states that despite the gossip about Sheryl, she received a postcard telling her the truth: Sheryl and Rick were well on their way to the west coast and they were doing well.  Alice then reveals that she learned some things that summer that she would never forget.  
There's a Zulu On My Stoep
 In [[Apartheid]] [[South Africa]], white boy Rhino Labuschagne and Zulu Mashebela were best friends until Rhino, pressured by his American girlfriend, Rowena, shoots a can off Zulu's head, abruptly ending their friendship. 25 years later, Zulu has become a car thief in New York, picking up an American accent but not forgetting his roots as "the champion mud slinger of the world". The prison's warden gets Zulu deported back to Africa by the Threatened Immigrants Right-wing Defence, or TIRD.  TIRD is a [[fascist]] organization run by a [[Germans|German]] named Gen. "Diehard" who is now dating Rowena. Rhino has become a game farmer with a black daughter named Tinkie, from a woman named Thandi. Rhino is losing money due to his ex-wife Rowena's divorce settlement.

Then his elephant sits on him.  
The Thief and the Cobbler
 The film opens with a narrator describing a prosperous city called the Golden City, ruled by the sleepy King Nod and protected by three golden balls atop its tallest [[minaret]]. According to a prophecy, the city would fall to a race of warlike, one-eyed monsters, known as "One-Eyes", should the balls be removed, and could only be saved by "the simplest soul with the smallest and simplest of things". Living in the city are the good-hearted [[Shoemaking|cobbler]] Tack, named for the ubiquitous pair of tacks held in his mouth, and a nameless, unsuccessful yet persistent [[thief]].  When the thief sneaks into Tack's house, the two fight and stumble outside, causing Tack's [[Nail (fastener)|tacks]] to fall onto the street. Zigzag, King Nod's [[Grand Vizier]], steps on one of the tacks and orders Tack to be arrested while the thief escapes. Tack is brought before King Nod and his daughter, Princess Yum-Yum. Before Zigzag can convince Nod to have Tack executed by [[Decapitation|beheading]], Yum-Yum saves Tack by breaking one of her shoes and ordering him to fix it. During repairs, Tack and Yum-Yum become increasingly attracted to each other, much to the jealousy of Zigzag, who plots to take over the kingdom by marrying the princess. Meanwhile, the thief notices the golden balls atop the minaret and decides to steal them. After breaking into the palace through a gutter, the thief steals the repaired shoe from Tack, prompting the cobbler to chase him through the palace. Upon retrieving the shoe, Tack bumps into Zigzag, who notices the shoe is fixed and imprisons Tack in a dungeon.  [[File:ThiefChars.PNG|thumb|left|From left to right: Tack the Cobbler, Zigzag the Grand Vizier, King Nod and Princess Yum-Yum. The [[model sheet|character designs]] are a combination of [[United Productions of America|UPA]] and [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] styles,<ref name=Briney/><ref name="Summer"/> and the overall style and flat [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] are inspired by [[Persian miniature painting]]s.<ref name="Summer"/><ref name=AlxWlms/><ref name=doc2/><ref name=doc1></ref>]] The next morning, Nod has a vision of the Golden City's destruction by the One-Eyes. While Zigzag tries to convince Nod of the kingdom's security, the thief steals the balls after several failed attempts, only to lose them to Zigzag's minions; Tack escapes from his cell using his cobbling tools during the ensuing panic. Nod notices the balls' disappearance when a mortally wounded soldier warns them of the invading One-Eyes. Zigzag attempts to use the stolen balls to blackmail the king into letting him marry Yum-Yum. When Nod dismisses him, Zigzag defects to the One-Eyes and gives them the balls instead.  Nod sends Yum-Yum, her nurse, and Tack to ask help from a "mad and holy old witch" in the desert. They are secretly followed by the thief, who hears of treasures on the journey but fails in stealing any. In the desert, they discover a band of dimwitted [[brigands]], led by Chief Roofless, whom Yum-Yum recruits as her bodyguards. The protagonists reach the hand-shaped tower where the witch lives, and, after the witch kills herself, learn that Tack is prophesied to save the Golden City. The witch also presents a riddle: "Attack, attack, attack! A tack, see? But it's what you do with what you've got!" before destroying the entire tower with a storm cloud.  The protagonists return to the Golden City to find the One-Eyes' massive war machine approaching. Remembering the witch's riddle, Tack shoots a single tack into the enemy's midst, sparking a [[Rube Goldberg machine|Goldberg-esque]] chain reaction that destroys the entire One-Eye army. Zigzag tries to escape, but steps on the tack which leads to him falling into a pit where he is eaten alive by alligators and his fat lazy vulture, Phido. The thief, avoiding many deathtraps, steals the golden balls from the collapsing machine, only to have them taken from him by Tack. With peace restored and the prophecy fulfilled, the city celebrates as Tack and Yum-Yum marry. The film ends with the thief stealing the reel of film and running away.   ===Changes made in subsequent versions===  *'''''The Princess and the Cobbler''''' (1993, [[Allied Filmmakers]]) The Allied Filmmakers cut is drastically different from Williams's workprint. Four musical numbers have been added; the film originally had none. Many scenes have been cut: These primarily consist of scenes involving the thief, most notably his attempted theft of an emerald and his subsequent evasion of capital punishment for it (though many of these scenes appear in the credits), and the subplot wherein Zigzag tries to feed Tack to Phido. Also removed are any references to the maiden from Mombassa, whom Zigzag gives to King Nod as a "plaything" in the workprint. Tack, almost mute in the workprint, speaks several times and narrates most scenes in [[past tense]]; the workprint had narration only in the beginning by a voice-over. Some subplots have been added; in one, Yum-Yum is tired of living a life of "regal splendor", and wishes to prove her worth to her father. Another subplot sees the nurse initially disliking Tack, and scolding Yum-Yum for harboring romantic feelings for him, but warming to him later on.  *'''''Arabian Knight''''' (1995, Miramax) The Miramax cut includes all changes made in the Allied Filmmakers cut. In addition, several previously mute characters are given voices, most notably the thief, who narrates over all of his scenes in the form of an [[inner monologue]]. The Golden City is now referred to as [[Baghdad]]. Most scenes featuring the Mighty One-Eye's slave women in detail have been removed, although he can still be seen sitting on them. The sequence featuring the witch has been almost entirely removed, as is most of the climactic battle sequence, which had already been greatly shortened in the Allied cut. One-Eye's death is cut, though he can be heard crying: "My machine!" as the war machine burns, whereupon he presumably burns with it.  *'''''The Recobbled Cut''''' (2006, 2007, 2013) Garrett Gilchrist's fan restorations mostly follow Richard Williams's workprint very closely, at least in their intent, using most of its original audio track and editing structure. In order to present a more complete film, Gilchrist added additional music (some from the released versions) and sound effects, and also included finished footage that does not appear in a finished state in the workprint, whether taken from the released versions or from other rare sources. Most of the story changes made by Fred Calvert and Miramax are not present, but it does include a few minor Calvert-only scenes or alterations, either as a side effect of using Calvert's footage as replacements for unfinished scenes in the workprint or because Gilchrist felt these scenes were useful to the plot. For this reason, Gilchrist does not refer to his edit as a "Director's Cut."<ref name=ocpinterview2></ref>  
Thanga Pappa
  Ravi ([[Thalaivasal Vijay]]), his wife Gowri ([[Aishwarya (actress)|Aishwarya]]), and their little daughter Abhirami ([[Shamili]]) move in an abandoned house. Ravi starts to work as an export manager in Ananthu ([[Keerikkadan Jose]]) and Swamy's ([[Thyagu (actor)|Thyagu]]) company. Ravi is helped in his work by the police officer Rajasekhar (Raviraj), the customs officer Ameer (Murali Kumar), and Ananthu's son Balaji (Prabhakaran). That night, strange things happen in their house. Abhirami often meets the old man Adaikalam ([[M. N. Nambiar]]) after the school in secret.  One day, Ameer, scared of something, accidentally falls off the ship and dies. The next day, Balaji is set on fire and dies from severe burns. TAdaikalam then confesses to Gowri that Abhirami is in fact possessed by the spirit of his granddaughter Angela.  Four years ago, Adaikalam's son [[Deputy superintendent|Assistant Commissioner of Police]] Lawrence ([[Ramki]]) got a transfer in a harbour city. He and his pregnant wife Thulasi ([[Sreeja]]) moved to the city and eagerly waited for the birth of their baby. The scanning had revealed that the baby is a girl, so they named her Angela. From the very earliest days of his posting, Lawrence became well-known by the local criminals. The smuggler Ananthu, his brother Swamy, and Balaji even threatened Lawrence and his wife, but Lawrence continued to seize Ananthu's illegal loads. Lawrence became friends with the Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajasekhar, his colleague. One night, Lawrence arrested Ananthu, Swamy, Balaji, and Ameer. They were all locked in the local police station. Rajasekhar released them and betrayed Lawrence's trust. Later that night, Lawrence was brutally killed and Thulasi was severely beaten up by the criminals in their house, resulting in abortion which left her mentally ill.  Ananthu, Swamy, and Rajasekhar also realize that Abhirami is possessed by the spirit. They are urged to kill the little girl. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.  
Three Colours: Blue
 Julie ([[Juliette Binoche]]), wife of the famous composer Patrice de Courcy, must cope with the death of her husband and daughter in an automobile accident she herself survives. While recovering in hospital, Julie attempts suicide by overdose, but cannot swallow the pills. After being released from hospital, Julie, who it is suggested wrote (or helped to write) much of her husband's famous pieces, destroys what is left behind of them. Calling Olivier ([[Benoît Régent]]), an unmarried collaborator of her husband's who has always admired her, she spends a night with him and says goodbye. Emptying the family house and putting it up for sale, she takes an apartment in Paris near [[Rue Mouffetard]] without telling anyone, her only memento being a mobile of blue beads that the viewer assumes belonged to her daughter.  Julie disassociates herself from all past memories and distances herself from former friendships, even being no longer recognised by her mother, who suffers from [[Alzheimer's disease]]. She also reclaims and destroys the unfinished score for her late husband's last commissioned work—a piece celebrating European unity following the end of the [[Cold War]]. Snatches of its music, however, haunt her throughout the film.  Despite her desire to live anonymously and alone, life in Paris forces Julie to confront elements of her past that she would rather not face. A boy who saw the accident seeks her out to give her a Christian cross he found by the car and to repeat her husband's last words, the punchline of an indelicate joke. She reluctantly befriends an [[exotic dancer]] named Lucille (Charlotte Véry) who is having an affair with one of the neighbors and helps her when she needs moral support. Then on TV she sees Olivier in an interview, announcing that he will try to complete Patrice's commission and showing pictures of Patrice with an attractive young woman.  While trying both to stop Olivier from completing the score and to find out who her husband's mistress was, she becomes more engaged in her former life. She tracks down Sandrine ([[Florence Pernel]]), Patrice's lover, and finds out that she is carrying his child; Julie arranges for her to have her husband's house, not yet sold, and recognition of his paternity for the child. This provokes her to restart her relationship with Olivier and to collaborate with him after all.  In the final sequence, part of their completed Unity of Europe piece is played (which features [[Choir|chorus]] and a solo [[soprano]] singing in [[Koine Greek|Greek]] the praise of divine love in [[Saint Paul (apostle)|Saint Paul]]'s first letter to the [[1 Corinthians 13|Corinthians]]) and images are seen of all the people Julie has affected by her actions. The final image is of Julie, crying—the second time she does so in the film.<ref>Kieślowski, Krzysztof, and Krzysztof Piesiewicz. ''Three Colours Trilogy: Blue, White, Red''.

Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould
 With memories revolving around the family's cottage near [[Lake Simcoe]], [[Glenn Gould]] recalls how in his childhood, he had ostensibly made the decision to become a concert pianist at age five. In fact, he believes his mother had already chosen that career for him. He recalls being able to read music before he could read books, and learned the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] from his mother. Gould later imagines [[interview]]ing himself, in which he confronts himself about why he chose to quit giving concerts at the age of 32, preferring to communicate to his audience through media instead. Gould reminds himself that the musician is inescapably an autocrat, no matter how benign.  In crafting [[radio documentary|radio documentaries]], Gould works on a piece called ''The Idea of North'', which touches on the effects the environment has on the solitude and isolation of the people of [[Northern Canada]]. In a media interview, Gould reveals that ''The Idea of North'' is one of only five of his documentaries about isolation, and that he intends to make a comedy next because he is tired of serious expression. Interviewers also push him to explain how he could achieve his level of musical perfection without interest in being overly technical in his piano playing. They ask why he insists on being interviewed only over the telephone. Others question if Gould's supposed obsession in technology is merely a smokescreen to keep his distance from real people.  As the markets plummet, Gould picks up word from the bodyguard of the visiting [[Ahmed Zaki Yamani|Sheik Yamani]] to invest in an obscure company called Sotex Resources, which is set to benefit from an exploration contract. Gould becomes the only client to profit in the wake of financial meltdown. However, Margaret Pacsu, a friend, notices Gould's bathroom is stocked heavily with various pills, including [[Valium]], [[Trifluoperazine]] and [[Librax]]. Gould laughs off the idea that he is taking all of the pills simultaneously, and Pacsu does not notice any affects on his personality. As his birthday approaches, Gould becomes concerned that no one will attend his funeral, despite being aware of strong record sales in [[Central Europe]] and Japan. Gould dies at age 50 of a stroke. His cousin, Jessie Greig, says Gould was wrong and his funeral was heavily attended.

The Three Musketeers (1993 film)
 In 1625, young-but-skilled fencer [[Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan#Portrayals in fiction|d'Artagnan]] sets off for [[Paris]], [[France]] in hopes to follow in his murdered father's footsteps and become a member of the [[musketeer]]s: the personal guard of the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]]. He is pursued by Gérard and his brothers, accused of blemishing their sister's [[honor]]. Unfortunately, [[Comte de Rochefort|Captain Rochefort]] of the [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]]'s Guards has disbanded the musketeers per the orders of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], the King's Minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with [[England]]. Rochefort informs Richelieu that three musketeers refused to relinquish their duties: [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]], [[Porthos]], and [[Aramis]].  In Paris, d'Artagnan encounters, and takes a liking to, Constance, a handmaiden of the Queen, and has a series of physical encounters with all three musketeers, though he doesn't ''know'' they are musketeers, resulting in a duel with each. At the dueling locale, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reveal themselves as musketeers to d'Artagnan's surprise. Before they can duel, a Captain of the Cardinal's Guard arrives to arrest the musketeers; although d'Artagnan is not under arrest, he allies with the musketeers during the skirmish. Impressed but displeased at d'Artagnan's involvement, the musketeers leave d'Artagnan behind after encouraging him to flee and maintain his innocence. When more of the Cardinal's Guards arrive, d'Artagnan is captured.  d'Artagnan eavesdrops on a conversation between Richelieu and the mysterious [[Milady de Winter]] whereupon he tasks her with delivering a signed [[treaty]] to England's [[Duke of Buckingham]]. d'Artagnan is unable to see her face before being caught by Rochefort; Richelieu orders him executed for refusing to give up the musketeers' location, but he is saved by the musketeers. As they flee, d'Artagnan reveals Richelieu's plans; they decide to find the spy and get the treaty to prove Richelieu's guilt.  During a skirmish, the party splits up; d'Artagnan rides ahead to intercept the spy, but passes out from exhaustion. He wakes in a bed stripped of his weapons and clothes as Milady de Winter tries to seduce him. d'Artagnan speaks freely of his plans, not knowing she is the spy; she tries to kill him, but he convinces her to keep him alive. As her party tries to escape by boat to England, they are confronted by the musketeers. Milady attempts to run away but is stopped by Athos, who calls her Sabine; they had been lovers, but he regretfully betrayed her to the authorities when he found out she was branded for execution. The musketeers retrieve the treaty and Sabine is sentenced to beheading for killing her first husband, Lord de Winter; just before she is executed, Athos begs her forgiveness. Moved, she reveals the Cardinal's plans to assassinate the king at his birthday celebration before throwing herself off a cliff to her death.  Athos, Porthos and Aramis send missives to rally the rest of the musketeers. Richelieu and Rochefort hired a [[sharpshooter]]; during the assembly, d'Artagnan makes the sniper's shot go wide, narrowly missing the king.

Eventually Ross abandons the film, only to continue it later: his wife is pregnant. The pregnancy comes to term and Ross and Marilyn go with their baby son to visit Charleen, who criticizes them for bringing children into such a hostile and unpredictable world but speaks to the passion that drives life and procreation.

[[Josephine Earp|Josephine Marcus]] and Mr. Fabian are also newly arrived with a traveling theater troupe. Meanwhile, Wyatt's common-law wife, [[Mattie Blaylock]], is becoming dependent on laudanum. Wyatt and his brothers begin to profit from a stake in a gambling emporium and saloon when they have their first encounter with the Cowboys. The Cowboys are identifiable by the red sashes worn around their waists.  As tensions rise, Wyatt is pressured to help rid the town of the Cowboys, though he is no longer a lawman. Curly Bill begins shooting at the sky after a visit to an opium den and is told by [[Fred White (marshal)|Marshal Fred White]] to relinquish his firearms. Curly Bill instead shoots the marshal dead, and is forcibly taken into custody by Wyatt. The arrest infuriates [[Ike Clanton]] and the other Cowboys. Curly Bill stands trial, but is found not guilty due to a lack of witnesses. Virgil, unable to tolerate lawlessness, becomes the new marshal and imposes a weapons ban within the city limits. This leads to a [[gunfight at the O.K. Corral]], in which Billy Clanton, Tom McLaury, and Frank McLaury are killed.

Tokyo Babylon
 The plot is told in a series of substories, published monthly or as 2-3 per volume. While it begins with a [[monster of the week]] approach, with somewhat independent running chapters, the plot gradually becomes continuous and backstory is introduced. It focuses on the development of the characters and the relationships between them.  Sixteen-year-old [[Subaru Sumeragi]], the main character, is a very powerful magician, the thirteenth head of the foremost family of [[onmyōji]] in Japan, which has served the Emperor for centuries. As such, he is called upon to solve various occult mysteries, or stumbles himself on people whom his kind nature compels him to help. These occurrences form the main plot of most chapters. He lives in Tokyo with his twin sister Hokuto, an exuberant girl whose chief occupations are to design eccentric clothing for herself and her brother, and to egg on their mutual friend [[Seishirō Sakurazuka]], a kindly, 25-year-old veterinarian, when he declares his love for Subaru.  There are early hints that Seishirō may not be all that he appears. Hokuto jokes about him being a member of the family of ''Sakurazukamori'', a clan of assassins who use onmyōjitsu to kill, and are pronounced to be the Sumeragis' opposite. Also, Subaru has dreams about having met someone under a cherry tree blooming out of season when he was but a small child, but he cannot quite recall what was being said. This person was actually Seishirō, upon whom Subaru stumbled when he had just performed a kill. According to the rules of the Sakurazukamori, Seishirō should have killed him, but impressed with the child's purity, he made a bet with him instead: He would meet Subaru again, and would then spend one year with him, protecting him and trying to love him. If, at the end of that year, he felt something for Subaru which distinguished him from a thing he could easily destroy, as he could not with any other person, then he would not kill him. To recognize him, he marked him with inverted pentagrams on both hands, the sign of the Sakurazukamori's prey. These marks are for most of the story hidden beneath the gloves Subaru continually wears on the direction of his grandmother, the previous family head, who recognized the marks and so hopes to conceal them with her magic.  Things come to a head when Seishirō loses an eye protecting Subaru, and Subaru realizes that he is in love with Seishirō. But the year is over, and Seishirō declares himself the winner of the bet. He breaks Subaru's arm and tortures him, but does not succeed in killing him, as Subaru's grandmother breaks his spell - an action which leaves her crippled. Subaru's shock and heartbreak leave him [[catatonia|catatonic]]. Hokuto, feeling guilty for her promotion of Seishirō, whom she knew to be dangerous, but also believed to be the only one who might touch Subaru's heart, leaves to find Seishirō and confronts him, asking to be killed by him and casting a spell with her death. Subaru, seeing her in a dream, is shocked out of his catatonia by her action. He vows to find Seishirō and take revenge for his sister's death.

Twenty Bucks
  An armored truck brings money to load an ATM. A woman withdraws $20 but the bill slips away. A homeless woman, Angeline ([[Linda Hunt]]), grabs the bill and reads the serial number, proclaiming that it is her destiny to win the lottery with those numbers. As she holds the bill, a boy grabs the bill from her and uses it at a bakery. The baker sells an expensive pair of figurines for a wedding cake to Jack Holiday (George Morfogen) and gives him the bill as change. At the [[rehearsal dinner]] for the upcoming wedding of Sam Mastrewski ([[Brendan Fraser]]) to Anna Holiday ([[Sam Jenkins]]), Jack reminisces about exchanging his foreign money for American currency when he first came to America, and he presents Sam with the $20 bill as a wedding present. Sam is taken aback by the perceived cheapness of his father-in-law-to-be, but is quickly "kidnapped" for his [[bachelor party]], where he uses the bill to pay the stripper ([[Melora Walters]]). Anna shows up to explain that the $20 is not the entire present and suggests they frame it to show that they understand its significance. Sam is unable to explain the absence of the bill, when the stripper comes in from the fire escape to offer it back to him. Anna apparently breaks the engagement.  The stripper uses the $20 bill to buy a herbal remedy from Mrs. McCormac ([[Gladys Knight]]). Mrs. McCormac mails the bill to her grandson Bobby (Willie Marlett) as a birthday present. Bobby goes to a convenience store where Frank ([[Steve Buscemi]]) and Jimmy ([[Christopher Lloyd]]) are engaged in a string of robberies. (During their spree, they prevent Angeline from buying a lottery ticket at a liquor store.) Not knowing he's a robber, the underage Bobby gives Jimmy the $20 bill to buy him wine. Jimmy goes into the store to find that Frank has botched the robbery. Jimmy and Frank leave, giving Bobby and his girlfriend Peggy champagne. The police chase the robbers, who hide in a used car lot. After the police pass by, Jimmy and Frank split up the money, but when Frank sees the $20 Jimmy got from the kid, he assumes that Jimmy is holding out on him. Jimmy tries to explain but Frank pulls a shotgun on him. Jimmy shoots Frank and takes all the money they've stolen, but leaves the $20 bill. The bill, now dripped with Frank's blood, winds up in the police evidence locker but falls into the wrong box.  Waitress and aspiring writer Emily Adams ([[Elisabeth Shue]]) shows up at the police precinct with boyfriend Neil ([[David Schwimmer]]) to claim some items the police recovered. The police officer ([[William H. Macy]]) unwittingly includes the $20 bill. After flying out of the box from the back seat of  Emily's convertible, the bill floats around town, and is picked up by a homeless man who uses it to buy groceries. (In this scene, Angeline is again unable to buy a lottery ticket.) The bill is given as change to a wealthy woman who uses it to snort cocaine off the back of her stretch limousine, although she leaves it on her car, where it is picked up by the drug dealer ([[Edward Blatchford]]).  The drug dealer also runs a day camp for youth, and he puts the bill into a fish where it is caught by a teen who has it converted to quarters and uses them to call a phone sex hotline in a bowling alley. The bowling alley owner ([[Ned Bellamy]]) gives the bill to his lover ([[Matt Frewer]]) and tells him to go out and have fun. The Frewer character encounters Sam, who is loitering in a daze behind the bowling alley. Sam turns down an offer of the $20 bill, not knowing it is the cause of his downfall. The Frewer character then uses it to play bingo at a church, where the priest is portrayed by [[Spaulding Gray]].

For this action of bravery, the King makes him [[Count]] of Montmirail and promises him the woman he loves, the beautiful Frénégonde de Pouille. On his way to the castle to marry Frénégonde, Godefroy takes a witch prisoner, and she drugs his drinking flask. Hallucinating, he believes the [[Duke]] of Pouille, father of his future wife, is a ferocious bear, and kills him with a crossbow bolt. During the Duke's funeral, Frénégonde refuses to marry Godefroy because of the tragedy; meanwhile, Godefroy's servant, the disreputable Jacquouille la Fripouille, steals the Duke's jewels at end of the funeral.  In an attempt to repair his mistake, Godefroy asks the wizard Eusebius to send him back in time to a moment before he shot the Duke. The old wizard muddles his magical spell, accidentally sending Godefroy and Jacquouille to the year 1992. There, they immediately run into trouble. Godefroy attacks a postman driving his car, mistaking him for a Moor in a devil's chariot; when he meets his descendant, Béatrice de Montmirail, an aristocrat who looks exactly like Frénégonde, she calls the [[National Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie]], who first imprison him, then as Béatrice thinks Godefroy is her distant cousin suffering from amnesia, take him to a mental hospital. Jacquouille, meanwhile, is befriended by Ginette la Clocharde ("Ginette the Tramp" in French), an attractive vagrant they meet early in their adventure.  Béatrice, thinking Godefroy to be her long-lost stuntman cousin Hubert, gets Godefroy out of the mental hospital and takes them back to her home, much to her husband (who greatly dislikes the fact of the two being in their home) Jean-Pierre's dismay. There, various culture-shock comedy ensues as Godefroy and Jacquouille attempt to fathom modern household appliances, such as flooding the bathroom by leaving the tap open, using an umbrella as a pike to roast a chicken and setting it on fire, drinking from the toilet bowl, trashing the bathroom during their baths and wasting all of the family's 6,000 [[French franc|FF]] [[Chanel No. 5]], greatly angering Jean-Pierre.  Seeing the family seal on Godefroy's hand, Beatrice assumes he stole the jewel from the castle de Montmirail, now renovated into an expensive hotel. They go there and meet the owner of the castle, the effete Jacques-Henri Jacquard, the unwitting descendant and close likeness of Jacquouille (they react to each other with mutual disgust). The jewel on Godefroy's hand starts to burn as they get closer to the castle, where the present-day version of the seal is. The two seals explode and destroy Jacquard's brand new [[Range_Rover#First_generation_.281970.E2.80.931996.29|Range Rover]].  Godefroy books a room for the night and reopens a secret passage known only to him. There he finds a letter telling him to go to a certain address, where an aged Monsieur Ferdinand, the last descendant of the wizard Eusebius, gives him the potion that will return him to the year 1123. Jacquouille, however, wants to stay, enjoying Ginette's company and having proved more adaptable than Godefroy in discovering toothpaste, modern clothing and other amenities of the future. Furious at his behavior, Godefroy finally brings him to the hotel room by force.  While Godefroy is talking with Béatrice, Jacquouille swaps jackets with his descendant, closes the curtains, dims the lights, drugs Jacquard and puts him on the bed in his place. In the dark, Godefroy gives Jacquard (thinking it is Jacquouille) the potion which then sends him back to the year 1123. Godefroy equally comes back just in time to stop himself from shooting Frénégonde's father, and the deflected [[crossbow]] bolt kills the witch who caused the whole misadventure by drugging Godefroy's [[Canteen (bottle)|flask]]. The bewildered Jacquard finds himself stranded in the past in the role of Godefroy's servant as Godefroy leaves on horseback with Frénégonde.

The Wedding Banquet
 Wai-Tung Gao and Simon are a happy [[same-sex couple|gay couple]] living in [[Manhattan]]. Wai-Tung is in his late 20s, so his tradition-minded parents are eager to see him get married and have a child in order to continue the family line. When Wai-Tung's parents hire a dating service, he and Simon stall for time by inventing impossible demands. They demand an opera singer and add that she must be 5'9", have two PhDs, and speak five languages. The service actually locates a 5'8" Chinese woman who sings Western opera, speaks five languages and has a single PhD. She is very gracious when Wai-Tung explains his dilemma, as she, too, is hiding a relationship (with a Caucasian man). At Simon's insistence, Wai-Tung decides to marry one of his tenants, Wei-Wei, a penniless artist from [[mainland China]] in need of a green card. Besides helping Wei-Wei, Simon and Wai-Tung hope that this will placate Wai-Tung's parents. Before Wai-Tung's parents arrive, Simon tells Wei-Wei everything she needs to know about Wai-Tung's habits, body, and lifestyle, and the three take down all homosexual content from their house and replace it with traditional Chinese scrolls.  Mr. and Mrs. Gao announce they will visit from Taiwan, bringing gifts and US$30,000 to hold an extravagant wedding for their son. Wai-Tung dares not tell his parents the truth, because his father, a retired officer in the [[National Revolutionary Army|Chinese Nationalist Army]], has just recovered from a stroke. As a part of the lie, Wai-Tung introduces Simon as his landlord. A day after Wai-Tung's parents arrive, he announces that Wei-Wei and he are planning to get their marriage certificate at city hall. However, the heartbreak his mother experiences at the courthouse wedding prepares the story for a shift to drama. The only way to atone for the disgraceful wedding is a magnificent wedding banquet, offered by Mr. Gao's former driver in the army who now owns a restaurant and reception hall. After the banquet, Wei-Wei has sex with a drunken Wai-Tung, and becomes pregnant. Simon is extremely upset when he finds out, and his relationship with Wai-Tung begins to deteriorate.  Shortly after, Mr. Gao has another stroke, and in a moment of anger, after a fight with both Simon and Wei-Wei, Wai-Tung admits the truth to his mother. She is shocked and insists that he not tell his father. However, the perceptive Mr. Gao has seen more than he is letting on; he secretly tells Simon that he knows about their relationship, and, appreciating the considerable sacrifices he made for his biological son, takes Simon as his son as well. Simon accepts the ''[[Red envelope|Hongbao]]'' from Wai-Tung's father, a symbolic admission of their relationship. Mr. Gao seeks and receives Simon's promise not to tell his secret for, as he points out, without the sham marriage, he'd never have a grandchild.  While en route to an appointment for an abortion, Wei-Wei decides to keep the baby, and asks Simon to stay together with Wai-Tung and be the baby's second father. In the final parting scene, as Wai-Tung's parents prepare to fly home, Mrs. Gao has forged an emotional bond to daughter-in-law Wei-Wei. Mr. Gao accepts Simon and warmly shakes his hand. In the end, both derive some happiness from the situation, and they walk off to board the aircraft, leaving the unconventional family to sort itself out.  
Weekend at Bernie's II
 Larry Wilson ([[Andrew McCarthy]]) and Richard Parker ([[Jonathan Silverman]]) are at a [[Manhattan]] morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax ([[Terry Kiser]]). Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel ([[Barry Bostwick]]), the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the  that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt.  Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's [[credit card]], in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a [[safe deposit box]] in [[St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the $2&nbsp;million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in.   Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu ([[Novella Nelson]]) is hired by mobsters to find the 2 million dollars Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry ([[Steve James (actor)|Steve James]]) and Charles ([[Tom Wright (actor)|Tom Wright]])—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a [[voodoo doll|voodoo]] ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy [[adult movie theatre|porno theater]] for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead. This limits Bernie's ability to walk toward the hidden money: he only moves when he hears music. At the [[Grand Central – 42nd Street (New York City Subway)|42nd St-Grand Central]] subway station, Henry and Charles soon abandon him to chase a man who stole their [[boombox]].  Later that night, Larry and Richard sneak into their office building to check Bernie's account, only to find that Bernie is the only one that can open it. They are soon arrested by the police for breaking and entering. After their release, they find Bernie (whom they believe is still dead), stuff him into a suitcase, bring him with them to the Virgin Islands, and put him into a small refrigerator in their hotel room. Unbeknownst to the two, Hummel is following them to recover the embezzled money. The guys successfully use Bernie to open his safety deposit box but they only find a map. Meanwhile, Larry befriends a lovely native girl named Claudia ([[Troy Beyer]]), and gives her the map. Later, he and Richard are captured by Henry and Charles, who take them to Mobu. With one of the mobsters holding a gun to his head, she forces Richard to drink a poisonous concoction and tells them they must find the map by sundown to get the antidote.  When Larry, Richard, and Claudia are reunited, they are shocked to discover that Bernie is moving and realize he is leading them towards the cash. To keep him moving, they put headphones on his head. As Bernie finds a large chest underwater, Larry accidentally shoots him in the head with an underwater [[speargun]], destroying the headphones. They attempt to bring Bernie back to the surface but he will not let go of the chest, which is too heavy to hoist out of the water. They end up attaching Bernie to a horse carriage with music playing. It seems to work at first, but when they go downhill, the carriage goes out of control. Eventually, the carriage ends up at Mobu's compound. Bernie hits a large tree branch and spins himself into a somersault before knocking out Mobu. The crash also causes Bernie to drop the chest on the ground and it breaks open. Larry tries to scoop up the money but is caught by Hummel (now slightly unhinged upon seeing the undead Bernie walk) and he relinquishes the $2 million to him. With Mobu out of commission, Claudia's father, a medical doctor, says that he can cure Richard if he can get the blood of a virgin (which Larry confesses he can provide). The mobsters and Mobu are arrested, and Bernie is last seen leading Henry and Charles, who have been transformed into goats by voodoo, in a carnival parade.  Larry confesses to Richard that he returned the $2&nbsp;million to the insurance company, but only after learning Bernie actually stole $3&nbsp;million. Larry and Richard use some of the remaining million to purchase a yacht crewed by attractive women.

In a [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] jungle, Rex is terrorizing other dinosaurs when a spaceship lands on [[Earth]], piloted by an alien named Vorb. Vorb captures Rex and gives him "Brain Grain", a breakfast cereal that [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphizes]] Rex and vastly increases his intelligence. Rex is introduced to other dinosaurs altered by the Brain Grain: a ''[[Triceratops]]'' named Woog, a ''[[Pteranodon]]'' named Elsa, and a ''[[Parasaurolophus]]'' named Dweeb. They soon meet Vorb's employer Captain Neweyes, the inventor of Brain Grain, who reveals his goal of allowing the children of the present time to see real dinosaurs. He plans to take them to Doctor Julia Bleeb who will guide them to the [[American Museum of Natural History|Museum of Natural History]], and warns them to avoid Professor Screweyes, his insane brother.  Neweyes drops the dinosaurs off in the [[Hudson River]] in the present day, but they are unable to meet with Bleeb. Instead, they meet a young boy named Louie, who plans on running away to join the circus. Louie agrees to help the dinosaurs get to the museum. Riding on Elsa, Louie soon encounters a girl named Cecilia, who is miserable with her life because of her neglectful parents. She agrees to run away with Louie and help the dinosaurs. To prevent mass panic, Louie decides that the dinosaurs need to stay hidden during their journey to the museum. He disguises them as floats in the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]]. When the audience realize that live dinosaurs are among them, they fly into a panic, and the dinosaurs flee to [[Central Park]] while being pursued by the police and the army.  Meanwhile, Louie and Cecilia meet Professor Screweyes, who is running his "Eccentric Circus". Unaware of Screweyes' sinister nature, the children sign a contract to perform in his circus troupe. When the dinosaurs arrive at the circus, Screweyes explains that he delights in scaring people and believes that the dinosaurs would make a great addition to his circus. Using his "Brain Drain", pills that are the polar opposite of his brother's Brain Grain, Screweyes [[Devolution (biology)|devolves]] Louie and Cecilia into [[chimpanzee|chimpanzees]]. When he offers the dinosaurs to consume the pills and join his circus as a ransom in exchange for the two children's freedom, they reluctantly accept and Screweyes releases Louie and Cecilia, agreeing to tear up their contract in the process. Knowing their friendship will be lost forever, Rex transforms Louie and Cecilia back to their human forms with his gentle pats.  As the kids awake the next morning, they are greeted by a circus clown named Stubbs, who works for Professor Screweyes and explains everything. Upon seeing the dinosaurs returned to their natural savage states, Louie and Cecilia plan to sneak into the night's show and save the dinosaurs with Stubbs' help. That night, Professor Screweyes opens his circus and unveils the dinosaurs to the terrified audience. Screweyes says he can control Rex, and proceeds to hypnotize him. However, a [[crow]] unintentionally activates the flare lights, breaking Rex out of the trance. Realizing he has been tricked, Rex becomes enraged and attempts to eat Screweyes. However, Louie steps in and desperately talks Rex out of killing Screweyes. His impassioned pleas and loving touches, along with Cecilia's, return Rex and the other dinosaurs to their kind and friendly natures. Captain Neweyes arrives in his ship and congratulates Louie and Cecilia, who proceed to kiss, while Stubbs announces his resignation from Professor Screweyes' employ. Neweyes, Louie, Cecilia and the dinosaurs board the aircraft, leaving Screweyes to be swarmed upon and devoured by the crows.  The dinosaurs spend the rest of their days in the museum, allowing children to see live dinosaurs, and thus fulfilling their wishes. Back in the present, Rex tells Buster that he and his fellow dinosaurs are still in the museum. He also reveals that Louie and Cecilia have reconciled with their respective parents and become a couple. Rex returns Buster to his family and tells him to remember his story and before leaving for the museum.

What's Eating Gilbert Grape
 In the small town of Endora, [[Iowa]], Gilbert Grape ([[Johnny Depp]]) is busy caring for Arnie ([[Leonardo DiCaprio]]), his mentally challenged brother, as they wait for the many tourists' trailers to pass through town during an annual [[Airstream#Airstreamers|Airstreamer's Club]] gathering at a nearby recreational area. His mother, Bonnie ([[Darlene Cates]]), gave up on life after her husband hanged himself in the basement seven years<ref></ref> earlier. She spends almost all of her time on the couch watching TV and eating. With Bonnie unable to care for her children on her own due to her morbid [[obesity]], Gilbert has taken responsibility for repairing the old house and looking after Arnie, who has a habit of climbing the town water tower, while his sisters Amy ([[Laura Harrington]]) and Ellen ([[Mary Kate Schellhardt]]) do the rest. The relationship between the brothers is of both care and protection, as Gilbert continually enforces the "nobody touches Arnie" policy. A new [[FoodLand]] supermarket has opened, threatening the small Lamson's Grocery where Gilbert works. In addition, Gilbert is having an affair with a married woman, Betty Carver ([[Mary Steenburgen]]).  The family is looking forward to Arnie's 18th birthday. A young woman named Becky ([[Juliette Lewis]]) and her grandmother are stuck in town when the [[International Harvester Travelall]] pulling their trailer breaks down. Gilbert's unusual life circumstances threaten to get in the way of their budding romance. In order to spend time with Becky to watch the sunset, Gilbert leaves Arnie alone in the bath. He returns home late and finds that Arnie is still in the bath the following morning, shivering in the (now cold) water; his guilt is compounded by his family's anger. His affair with Betty ends when she leaves town in search of a new life following her husband's death—he drowned in the family's [[Swimming pools#Children's pools|wading pool]] after suffering a heart attack. Becky becomes close to both Gilbert and Arnie. While they are distracted during one of their talks, Arnie returns to the water tower that he is always trying to climb. Arnie is arrested after being rescued from the top of the tower, causing his mother—who has not left the house in seven years—to become the object of pointing, laughing, and gawking from the townspeople as she goes to the police station, forcing Arnie's release.  Soon after, Arnie tries to run away yet again from his bath and in his frustration, Gilbert finally snaps, hitting Arnie several times. Guilty and appalled at himself, Gilbert runs out and drives away in his truck without another word. Arnie also runs out and goes to Becky's, who takes care of him for the evening until he is picked up by his sisters. After some soul searching aided by Becky, Gilbert returns home during the birthday party to make amends to his family for running out and to be forgiven by Arnie which, with only the slightest hesitation, he is. He apologizes to his mother for his behavior and promises that he is not ashamed of her and that he will not let her be hurt any more. She admits to Gilbert her knowledge of what a burden she has become to the family, and he forgives her. He introduces her to Becky—something he had been reluctant to do earlier.  Following Arnie's 18th birthday party, Bonnie climbs the stairs to her bedroom for the first time since her husband's suicide. Arnie later tries to wake her but discovers that she has died. The children, not willing to let their mother become the joke of the town by having her corpse lifted from the house by crane, empty their family home of possessions and set it on fire. A year later, Gilbert describes what happened to his family after his mother's death, as Gilbert and his brother Arnie wait by the side of a road for Becky, who arrives with her grandmother, and picks them up.

Burton, now living and working as the chief [[Taxidermy|taxidermist]] at a [[Museum of Natural History]], is searching for a centerpiece display for an exhibit in his Hall of Contagion. He comes up with the idea of featuring AIDS and the [[Index case|Patient Zero]] hypothesis. Accepting the popular belief that Zero introduced the virus to North America, Burton sets out to collect video footage from those who knew Zero to support the hypothesis. When Zero's doctor ([[Brenda Kamino]]), mother ([[Charlotte Boisjoli]]) and former airline colleague Mary ([[Dianne Heatherington]]), who is now with [[ACT UP]], all refuse to demonize Zero, Burton manipulates the footage to make it appear as if they do and includes doctored photographs of Zero showing signs of [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]. He presents this preliminary version to the press.  The ghost of Zero ([[Normand Fauteux]]) materializes at a local [[gay bathhouse]]. No one can see or hear him, until Zero runs into Burton while Burton is spying on Zero's friend George. Zero realizes that Burton can see him, although Zero does not show up on Burton's video camera. The two strike a deal; Zero agrees to help Burton with his Patient Zero exhibit if Burton finds a way to make Zero appear.  The two return to the museum where Burton makes a ridiculous attempt to seduce Zero to ensure his participation. Rejecting his advances, Zero examines some of the other exhibits (including displays on [[Typhoid Mary]] and the [[Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male|Tuskegee syphilis study]]) before finding an [[African green monkey]], another suspected early AIDS vector. The monkey ([[Marla Lukofsky]]) angrily denounces Zero for scapegoating her just as he has been scapegoated. Zero turns to Burton and they make love.  Under pressure from his director and the exhibit's drug manufacturer sponsor, Burton steals Zero's medical records in hopes of discovering new information. Zero and Burton examine an old blood sample of Zero's under a microscope and discover Miss HIV ([[Michael Callen]]), who points out that the original study that was used to label Patient Zero as the first person to bring HIV to North America did not prove any such thing, but instead helped prove that HIV was sexually transmitted, leading to the development of [[Safe sex|safer sex]] practices. Under this interpretation, Zero could be lauded as a hero for his candor in participating in that original study. As Burton ponders this, an unknown fluid squirts from the eye pieces of the microscope, drenching Zero and making him appear on video. He joyously declares his innocence on tape but the effect only lasts five minutes before he fades away again. Zero angrily accuses Burton of not caring for him at all and only wanting to use him for the exhibit, then storms out.  Burton fails to complete the revised Patient Zero exhibit before its scheduled opening date. The museum curator substitutes the original presentation instead over Burton's protests, leading to a renewed rush of press scapegoating Zero. The night after the exhibit opens, Mary and other ACT UP members break into the Hall of Contagion and trash the exhibit. Zero returns and Burton explains that he tried to stop the exhibit. Zero forgives Burton but says he wants to disappear again completely. Zero merges with his disfigured video image and, smoking a cigarette inside the video, sets off the fire alarm. The sprinklers destroy the video player and Zero vanishes.  A major subplot involves George ([[Richardo Keens-Douglas]]), a French teacher and former intimate of Zero's. George is losing his sight to [[cytomegalovirus]] and is taking a drug that is manufactured by a company that, as a member of ACT UP, George is protesting. George struggles through the film to resolve his conflicted feelings over this, his guilt over abandoning Zero during the final days of his illness and his fear that the same thing will happen to him.
