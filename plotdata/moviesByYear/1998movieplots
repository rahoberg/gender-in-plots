 Johnnie Maher is under a lot of pressure.  Recently emigrated from Ireland to The Bronx, he sleepwalks and experiences nightmares.  Try as he might, he can not identify the cause of his torment or make sense of the fleeting remains of his dreams.  He shrugs them off, but things seem to be getting worse.  Johnnie works as foreman on his uncle Trump's construction crew.  Work tensions run high as the building owners complain about the cost and pace, while the workers constantly find their pay-packets shorted.  Sly as a fox, Uncle Trump always explains everything away.  Even when arrested for indecent exposure in a park frequented by gay men on the prowl for sex, he handily swears he only stopped there to relieve himself and was arrested by mistake.  Openly bisexual, Johnnie's pressures mount when his girlfriend, Maria, and a sex-partner, Christian, begin to pressure him for more commitment.  He fumbles his responses, and no one is satisfied.  Finally, Johnnie catches his Uncle Trump in an act that fractures the dam of memories, and in a short time, they come flooding back into Johnnie's consciousness.  Although shaken to his core, Johnnie finds the answers he needs.  Most importantly, he survives the flood and can finally move forward.

Affliction (1997 film)
 The film begins with a voice-over narration by Rolfe Whitehouse, announcing the story of his brother Wade's "strange criminal behavior" and subsequent disappearance.  Wade Whitehouse is a small-town policeman in [[New Hampshire]]. On [[Halloween]] night, Wade meets his daughter Jill from his divorced marriage, but he is late and the evening is overshadowed by disharmony. Jill eventually calls her mother to come and pick her up. When his ex-wife finally arrives, Wade shoves her lover against their car and watches them drive away with Jill. Wade vows to get a lawyer to help gain custody of his daughter.  The next day, Wade rushes to the scene of a crime. A hunting guide named Jack claims that the man with whom he was hunting accidentally shot and killed himself. The police believe Jack, but Wade grows suspicious, believing that the man's death was no accident. When he is informed that the victim was scheduled to testify in a lawsuit, his suspicion slowly turns into conviction.  A while later, Wade and his girlfriend Margie Fogg arrive at the house of Wade's father, Glen Whitehouse, whose abusive treatment of Wade and Rolfe as children is seen in flashbacks throughout the film. Wade finds his mother lying dead in her bed from hypothermia. Glen Whitehouse reacts to her death with little surprise. At the funeral wake, the father gets drunk and loudly exclaims, "Not one of you is worth one hair on that woman's head!", resulting in a confrontation between himself and Wade.  Rolfe, who has come home for the funeral, suggests at first that Wade's murder theory could be correct, but later renounces himself of this presumption. Nonetheless, Wade becomes obsessed with his conviction. When Wade learns that town Selectman Gordon Lariviere is buying up property all over town with the help from a wealthy land developer, he makes the solving of these incidents his personal mission. Suffering from a painful toothache and becoming increasingly socially detached, he behaves more and more unpredictably. He follows Jack, convinced that Jack is running away from something and is involved in a [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]]. After a car chase, a nervous Jack finally pulls over, threatens Wade with a rifle, shoots out his tires, and drives off.  Finally, Wade is fired from his police job both for his constant harassment of Jack and his trashing of Lariviere's office. He collects Jill from her mother's house, where his ex-wife furiously castigates his plans to sue for full custody. At the local restaurant, he attacks the bartender in front of his daughter after he jokingly insults Wade. Then Wade takes Jill home to find Margie leaving him. Wade grabs Margie and begs her to stay with him, but Jill rushes up and tries to push Wade away. In response, Wade pushes Jill, causing her nose to bleed. She and Margie drive off. Wade is then approached by his father Glen, who congratulates him for finally acting as a "real man". The latent aggression between the men culminates in a fight in which Wade accidentally kills his father. He burns the corpse in the barn, sits down at the kitchen table and starts drinking, while the barn can be seen burning down through a window.  Rolfe's narration reveals that Wade eventually murdered Jack and left town (possibly to Canada, where Jack's truck was found three days later), never to return. Rolfe relates that the town later became part of a huge ski resort partly organized by Gordon Lariviere. He concludes that someday a vagrant resembling Wade might be found frozen to death, and that will be the end of the story.

Every Monday, a new group of recently deceased people check in, and the "social workers" in the lodge explain their situation.

The Acid House (film)
  The film dramatises three stories from the book: * "The Granton Star Cause": A comedy, in which Boab is having a very bad day indeed. His parents throw him out so they can indulge in [[sado-masochism]] and he is sacked from his job, dumped by his girlfriend and dropped from his [[football (soccer)|football]] team. It has elements of [[Franz Kafka]]'s ''[[The Metamorphosis]]''. One of the characters is a pitiless and profane God, who transforms him into a fly as punishment for wasting his life. Named after an Edinburgh housing district, "The Granton Star Cause" was filmed on location in the area as well as nearby West Pilton, including Ferry Road Drive. * "A Soft Touch": [[Kevin McKidd]] plays a cuckolded husband while [[Gary McCormack]] is Larry, the ruthless upstairs neighbour who steals his electricity and his wife, played by [[Michelle Gomez]]. * "The Acid House": An [[LSD|acid]] trip and a bolt of [[lightning]] result in amiable schemie Coco Brice exchanging bodies with the baby of a [[middle class|middle-class]] couple.  All three sections are independent, but are linked by setting and by the reappearance of incidental characters, in particular [[Maurice Roëves]] who appears variously as an inebriated wedding guest, a figure in a dream, and a pub patron. All three of his parts symbolise a human manifestation of God.  The film offended elements of the UK tabloid press with a depiction of a cynical and jaded, foul-mouthed God. In some English-speaking countries (such as Canada and the United States) it has been screened with subtitles because of the heavy [[Edinburgh]] accents.

Almost Heroes
 Leslie Edwards ([[Matthew Perry]]), a foppish aristocrat, and the loud, low-brow Bartholomew Hunt ([[Chris Farley]]) are competing against the renowned [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis & Clark]] to be the first to chart and make it across the [[United States]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. In the beginning of the film, Edwards has high hopes to head the first expedition to make it across the U.S., but while he has ambition and funding, he has grown up sheltered and knows little of the wilderness he seeks to cross. To aid in his journey, he hires the services of a supposedly knowledgeable wilderness-man and tracker, Hunt, who, once they get underway, turns out to be less than advertised.  They are aided by a crew of varied, rugged and grizzled frontiersmen, including the group's version of [[Sacagawea]], a young Indian woman by the name Shaquinna ([[Lisa Barbuscia]]), who is integral in helping them find their way across the dangerous and unknown terrain ahead, as well as eventually becoming Edwards' love interest. Along the way, the group goes through various mishaps and ordeals from having to deal with quirky, indigenous Indian tribes and vicious eagles, to running out of food and romantic snafus, as Hunt's ineptness often causes more problems than it solves. Along the way, Edward and Hunt's shared journey helps Edwards shed his aristocratic, snooty ways and he learns camaraderie and honor, as well as a more humble view of a world he thought he understood. Hunt finds true friendship in Edwards and a sense of self-confidence he had not known before.  After many hardships and setbacks, they eventually make it to the Pacific coast just minutes before Lewis and Clark's expedition; however, once the celebration is over, they find that they do not necessarily want to go back to their old lives and collectively decide to continue their adventure, leading Edwards and Hunt's expedition to further explore the great uncharted world.

Against the child’s wishes his mother sends Martin to live with his father, who until then he does not know. Victor is married and has three sons older than Martin. The move is not a happy one and quickly Martin finds himself in conflict with his brash, cold father.  Ten years later, just after his twentieth birthday, Martin flees his home following his father's death. He disappears wandering across the country side and tries unsuccessfully to drown himself. Martin emerges weeks later at his half-brother Benjamin’s apartment in Paris. Benjamin is a struggling actor sharing living arrangements with his best friend Alice, a violinist in a local quintet that specializes in tango music. More outgoing that his younger brother, Benjamin, who is gay, has a close platonic relationship with Alice. Martin finds success quickly–within weeks he is a highly sought-after model. Alice is nervous and brittle, harboring her own private grief, the tragic death at age eleven of her gifted sister. At first Alice resents Martin's presence in the apartment and she is cold towards him. Though Alice does not like the brooding Martin much, he becomes obsessed with her and starts surreptitiously following her. Alice discovers it and confronts him. She is gradually captivated by his attentions, and the two begin a passionate love affair.  Leaving Benjamin behind, Alice accompanies Martin to Granada, Spain, on a modeling shoot. Their happiness is brief. During the trip Martin's behavior becomes erratic and he becomes more and more self-obsessed. When Alice reveals she is pregnant, his decline continues. Martin suffers a nervous breakdown and falls into coma. The doctors determine that his condition is psychosomatic. In an effort to restore his health, Alice rents a cabin by the sea in Spain’s south coast. Martin swims for hours each night, but remains withdrawn. He is haunted by his father’s death.  A flash back recounts the period preceding Victor Sauvagnac’s death. His relationship with his sons was problematic: the aimless and withdrawn Martin failed to please him; Benjamin irritated him and a reunion about the prospects of the family's business ended up in a fist fight between Francois and Frédéric, the two eldest siblings. Martin celebrates his 20th birthday with Benjamin, who comes from Paris for the occasion. Their reunion is interrupted by a phone call from Francois who commits suicide hanging himself in the family's factory. When Martin decides to leave for Paris an argument erupts and Martin pushes his father downs the stairs killing him. Unable to deal with what he has just done, Martin runs away.  After Martin reveals that he caused his father's death, unable to bear the guilt and pain any longer, he commits himself to a mental institution. Alice, following Martin’s wishes, travels to Cahors  to talk to the Sauvagnac family. She befriends Martin's mother, but Lucie, Victor’s widow, is unsympathetic. Frédéric Sauvagnac, who is the town's major, is openly hostile. Benjamin comes to town in an effort to stop Alice interfering in his family affairs. However they two reconcile. Eventually Lucie decides to tell the authorities about Martin’s culpability in her husband’s death. Martin confesses his crime, surrender to the authorities and goes to prison. Alice decides to have her baby. She appears playing her violin in a wedding. Martin is in prison but, in a letter to Alice, he seems to be finally at peace with himself.  
All I Wanna Do (1998 film)
 The film takes place at an elite [[New England]] [[boarding school]] in 1963 before the assassination of President [[John F. Kennedy]].  Odette "Odie" Sinclair (Hoffmann) is forcibly transferred by her parents to Miss Godard's Preparatory School for Girls after her parents find out that she has planned to have sex with her boyfriend, Dennis (Matthew Lawrence).  Upon arrival to the school, which is run by the stern but kind headmistress Miss McVane (Redgrave), Odette is introduced to her roommates, the intelligent and charismatic Verena von Stefan (Dunst) and the promiscuous Tinka Parker (Keena).  Verena and Tinka are the school's primary troublemakers; both mock an uptight [[hall monitor]] named Abigail "Abby" Sawyer (Cook), who has a penchant for tattletaling, and Verena regularly buys [[cigarettes]] from a lunch cook and is constantly late for classes.  After a brief [[hazing]] period, Odie is welcomed into the D.A.R. (Daughters of the American Ravioli), a club of several girls at the school who have greater aspirations than those of their peers; the members congregate in the school's attic, where they have access to canned ravioli stored above the cafeteria.  The club is led by Verena, and consists of several other girls, including Theresa "Tweety" Goldberg (Matarazzo), a [[bulimic]] who self-induces vomiting by drinking [[ipecac]] syrup and plans to be a child psychologist; and Maureen "Momo" Haines (Merritt Wever), a well-spoken science nerd and aspiring biologist.  Verena has plans to start a fashion magazine like ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', while Tinka plans to be an "actress-folk singer-slut".  Odette declares her interest in politics, but pines to finish what she started with Dennis and lose her virginity.  The D.A.R. begins planning a rendezvous for Odie and Dennis, but when it is discovered that Miss Godard's is considering going [[co-ed]] with the nearby St. Ambrose boys' academy, the girls become divided on the matter and ultimately the club breaks up, leaving Verena and Momo to plan a sabotage for an upcoming dance with the St. Ambrose boys.  Meanwhile, the board of [[trustees]] for the school, which include Abby's parents, deliberates on the matter.  Miss McVane detests the [[merger]], but can do little about it because of the school's financial problems.  As the St. Ambrose dance arrives, Verena and Momo concoct a plan to cast the boys' academy in a bad light, by spiking the fruit punch with alcohol from the [[chemistry]] lab and feeding them Tweety's ipecac to induce vomiting during their choir performance; Verena then plants empty liquor bottles in their school bus.  The same night, Dennis arrives at the academy dressed in a St. Ambrose uniform and meets Odette for their rendezvous in the attic of the school.  Tweety and Tinka have a change of heart on the co-ed integration after Tweety is humiliated by some St. Ambrose students.  With the help of a group of teenage male townies called "The Flat Critters", led by Snake (Kartheiser) who has a crush on Tinka, they end up sending the intoxicated St. Ambrose boys home with a poor reputation.  Miss McVane recognizes Verena as the mastermind behind the sabotage.  Despite Miss McVane's appreciation for Verena's efforts, she is forced to expel Verena for having been caught fraternizing in her undergarments with a St. Ambrose boy.  The following week at the end of the year ceremony, the announcement of the merger is made by Mrs. Sawyer, much to the disapproval of the girls, including Abby.  The students, led by Odie, hole up inside the school dormitories and demand a student body vote count as a single vote on the board of trustees.  Meanwhile, a media circus surrounds the school, and the board of trustees agree to a student vote.  Ultimately, the votes against the integration outnumber those for it, and the students donate their personal savings to help with the school's debt.  In a humorous epilogue prior to the credits, the following is revealed: Verena goes on to publish ''Moi'', one of the most-read women's publications in the world; Odette becomes a congresswoman and declares war on the [[tobacco industry]]; Momo is a scientist developing the first male oral [[contraceptive]]; Tinka, a famous actress, [[coming out of the closet|comes out]] to [[Barbara Walters]] in a 1997 interview; Tweety became a psychologist and wrote a best-seller about bulimia; Abby, a radical [[political activist]], is serving a prison sentence for a 1970 bank holdup; and Miss Godard's is still a girls school.  
American History X
 High school student Danny Vinyard receives an assignment from his history teacher Mr. Murray to write a paper on "any book which relates to the struggle for human rights." Knowing Murray is Jewish, Danny writes his paper on [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. Murray attempts to get Danny expelled for doing this, but African-American Principal Dr. Bob Sweeney refuses, instead informing Danny that he will study history and current events under Sweeney, and that the class will be called "American History X." Danny's first assignment is to prepare a paper on his brother Derek, a former [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] leader.  A few years earlier, Danny and Derek's father Dennis Vinyard was murdered by black drug dealers after being sent on a call to fight a fire in a drug den. In a television interview conducted after Dennis's death, Derek erupts in a long racist tirade. Shortly thereafter, Cameron Alexander and Derek form a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] gang called the Disciples of Christ (D.O.C.). As a skilled basketball player, Derek is reluctantly dragged into a 3-on-3 game against several members of the [[Crips (gang)|Crips]] in which the prize is control of the recreation center basketball courts. After winning with his friends, Derek leads a large gang of skinheads to attack a supermarket owned by a Korean that included African-American and Latino workers. Derek's mother Doris invites Murray, whom she is dating, home for dinner, which turns into a full-blown argument between Derek and Murray, causing them to leave. That night, as Danny hears people attempting to steal Dennis' truck, Derek shoots and kills one of the thieves and [[curb stomp]]s another, before being arrested. He is sentenced to three years in prison for [[voluntary manslaughter]].  Derek is given a job in the prison laundry and assigned to be the partner of Lamont, a black man who is serving six years for assaulting a police officer. The pair later develop a rapport over their shared love of basketball. Derek joins the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], but after about a year, he becomes disillusioned because some members have ties to other prison gangs who are of different ethnicities. As punishment, he is beaten and raped in the shower by the Aryan Brotherhood members; Derek recovers and is visited by Sweeney, whom he asks for help to be paroled. Sweeney informs him of Danny's involvement with neo-Nazis, and warns that he is on the same path as Derek. Derek further distances himself from the Aryan Brotherhood and spends the remainder of his time in prison alone, reading books that Sweeney sends him. Finally realizing the error of his ways, Derek leaves prison a changed man. Upon arriving home, he finds that Danny has a D.O.C. tattoo and tries to persuade him to leave the gang. They subsequently go to a neo-Nazi party, where Derek tells Cameron that he and Danny will no longer associate with the movement; this causes Cameron, Derek's girlfriend, and all the other neo-Nazis to turn on him. After leaving the party, Derek tells Danny about his experience in prison, which seems to prompt a change in Danny.  The next morning, Danny finishes his paper, which reflects on why he had adopted Nazi values and why they were deeply flawed. Derek walks Danny to school, and on their way they stop at a diner. Sweeney and a police officer tell Derek that his friend Seth and Cameron were attacked the previous night. At school, Danny is ambushed and killed in the bathroom by a young black student named Little Henry. Derek arrives at the school and mourns for Danny.  
An American Tail: The Treasure of Manhattan Island
 The story begins in [[New York City]] setting either sometime before or after the second movie, as Fievel and Tony discover that an ancient treasure lies underneath [[Manhattan]] when snooping around an abandoned subway (the [[Beach Pneumatic Transit]] system) and stumbling upon the remains of a dead mouse clutching a treasure map, deciding they must find it with the help of an [[archaeologist]] Tony knows: Dr. Dithering, along with fighting five villains as well.  The movie focuses on the relationship between the over-exploited workers of a [[sweatshop]] (in this case, a [[cheese]] production line) and the factory's [[Robber baron (industrialist)|robber baron]] owners: Mr. Grasping ([[Ron Perlman]]), Mr. Toplofty ([[Tony Jay]]) and Mr. O'Bloat ([[Richard Karron]]). It also focuses on the plight of the Native Americans in the United States. The treasure under Manhattan turns out to be a group of [[Lenape]] mice living a long distance beneath the surface (far below the sewers, riding in [[Beach Pneumatic Transit|an underground pressurized train]]) that decided to hide when they saw how the first Europeans only brought war and disease with them and didn't want to wait for the European mice to do the same to them. An emotional scene ensues when Fievel must struggle with how cruel his own people, the Europeans, were (and still are at the time the film takes place) to the [[Native Americans in the United States|natives of America]].  The sachem, Chief Wulisso ([[David Carradine]]), decides to send his daughter Cholena (Elaine Bilstad), to the surface to see if they have "changed their ways." Upon their return, Scuttlebutt ([[John Kassir]]) (one of the members of the expedition to find the treasure) reports to the villains unbeknownst to the rest of the members of the expedition, who then decide to use this to their advantage. They lie to all the workers of the sweatshop about Cholena (obviously not by name), telling them that she is their enemy. The mouse [[NYPD]] Chief, McBrusque ([[Sherman Howard]]) and Scuttlebutt engage in a bout of [[police brutality]], scavenging every nook and cranny until they find her. After the angry mouse mob try to capture Cholena and anyone else involved with her, Fievel and his friends decide to take Cholena back underground, but the police find out and go after them. Meanwhile, everyone finds out about Dr. Dithering's friendship with the Indian and take him to the butcher shop for his execution. Papa tells everyone about how madness like this is why they all left for America and should work together to become friends with those different from them as the fellow Americans they are. Tiger saves Dr. Dithering from the villains, who escape and order McBrusque and his men to find and murder the Native Americans. Upon returning Cholena to her home, they tell the chief what is happening. McBrusque, Scuttlebutt, and the other police officers show up to the village, but the Chief, the Native Americans, Fievel and his friends drive the villains away. The chief gives them a [[gunpowder]] [[bomb]] to collapse the tunnel connecting the Native Americans to the outside world. But before they can do so, they are ambushed by the enraged McBrusque and Scuttlebutt who attempt to kill the kids once and for all, but the two crooks are overpowered and Fievel manages to set off the bomb. This floods the tunnel, together with McBrusque and Scuttlebutt as they fall into the [[chasm]] to their deaths. Tony and Tanya managed to reach higher ground, but Fievel is seemingly carried off by the current. When the water recedes Tanya and Tony desperately search through the mud to find him, before giving up. But just then, Fievel breaks through the surface, and they all three share a muddy group hug, thankful that everyone survived.  The movie ends with Fievel's papa forming a [[worker's union]] and the villains agreeing amongst themselves to negotiate "with that riff-raff" because otherwise, they'll go on strike and make them go bankrupt while Tiger the Bass, Baritone, and Tenor-singing orange tabby cat, who is now the new police chief, watches them. The last scene is Fievel seeing, through a foldable telescope, Cholena and her father disappearing into a hidden door at the foot of a statue, which pleases Fievel.

Among Giants
 Ray (played by Postlethwaite) is a middle-aged Sheffield father of two, down on his luck. Separated from his wife, his life revolves around his close friendship with his much younger flatmate Steve (Thornton) and a passion for climbing.  One summer, the pair and their loose gang of workers gain illicit, cash-in-hand employment painting the [[electricity pylon]]s of the [[Yorkshire Moors]]. Their deadline is tight and their terms of employment precarious, but both are grateful for money and the opportunity to climb daily.  The pattern of life is interrupted by the arrival of footloose Australian backpacker Gerry (Rachel Griffiths). Attractive, and a talented climber, she and Ray fall in love and become a couple despite Steve's apparent interest.  Ray harbours some reluctance at Gerry's wild ways, but manages to overcome these to propose marriage. Gerry too is doubtful that her wandering days are over, and wonders if she can live the staid existence on offer, despite her love for Ray. Things come to a head when she and Steve, both clearly affected by the backpacking bug, are caught drinking vodka atop a tall pylon.   Abseiling recklessly to face an angry Ray, she and Steve are fired on the spot.  In a confrontation, Gerry tells Ray that she cannot commit to the relationship, nor be tied down. Meanwhile, Ray's friendship with an increasingly jealous Steve is also in trouble, and the younger man moves out of the flat, planning his own travels to [[India]]. He and Gerry have a brief sexual encounter, but back out when they recognise the wrongs of their actions.  Gerry waits on Ray's doorstep, hoping for some form of reconciliation, but is rejected. Upset, and undertaking a solo rock climb, she falls and is hospitalised with serious injuries. As Ray is being told this by an emotional Steve, the pylons are electrified as Ray's gang are still at work, and the crew are lucky to escape without electrocution.   This heralds the end of the summer's work, and their elusive paymaster Derek, the electricity company official, arrives on the scene. He is apologetic at the mistake, but cannot say when the workers will receive their pay.  The film ends on an uncertain note, with Steve departing for India, a recovered Gerry deciding to return to Australia, and Ray left standing on the Moors contemplating his scant options.  
Antz
  In an [[ant colony]], Z-4195, or "Z" for short, is a neurotic and pessimistic worker ant who longs to express himself. Bala, the princess of the colony, visits a bar to escape her suffocating royal life, and Z falls in love with her there.  The ant colony declares war on an encroaching [[termite]] colony and a large force of soldier ants is mobilized for an attack. To see Bala again, Z exchanges places with his soldier friend Weaver and joins the army, where he befriends Barbatus, a staff sergeant. Z is unaware that the army's leader and Bala's fiancé General Mandible is secretly sending the soldiers loyal to the Queen Ant to die so he can stage a [[coup]]. At the base of a tree near nightfall, Z realizes he is marching into battle. Everyone except Z is killed by [[Fontanellar gun|acid-shooting]] termite defenders. Before dying, Barbatus tells Z to think for himself instead of following orders.  Z returns home and is hailed as a war hero. Secretly irate, Mandible congratulates him and introduces him to the Queen. There he meets Bala, who eventually recognizes him as a worker. Z panics and pretends to take Bala hostage, causing him and Bala to fall out of the anthill via a garbage chute. Z decides to search for Insectopia, a legendary insect paradise. Bala attempts to return to the colony but quickly rejoins Z after encountering a praying mantis.  News of the incident spreads through the colony, and Z's act of individuality inspires the workers and some soldier ants, halting productivity. To gain control, Mandible publicly portrays Z as a self-centered war criminal. Mandible promotes the glory of conformity and promises them a better life through the reward of completing a "Mega Tunnel" planned by himself. However, Colonel Cutter, Mandible's second-in-command, becomes concerned about Mandible's plans.  After various misadventures, Z and Bala find Insectopia, a human waste-bin overfilled with decaying food. Bala begins to reciprocate Z's feelings. After interrogating Weaver, Mandible learns that Z is looking for Insectopia and sends Cutter to retrieve Bala and kill Z. That night, Cutter arrives in Insectopia and forcibly flies Bala back to the colony. Z finds them gone and returns to the colony.  When Z arrives, he finds Bala held captive in Mandible's office. After freeing her, she tells him that Mandible's "Mega Tunnel" leads straight to the lake (a puddle next to Insectopia) which Mandible will use to drown the Queen Ant and workers at the opening ceremony. Bala warns the ants at the ceremony, while Z goes to the tunnel exit to stop the workers but fails, and the water leaks in. Z and Bala unify the workers into building a [[Human tower (gymnastic formation)|towering ladder]] of themselves towards the surface as the water rises.  Meanwhile, Mandible and his soldiers gather at the surface, where he explains his vision of a new colony with none of the "weak elements of the colony". When the workers break through, Mandible tries to kill Z, but Cutter rebels against Mandible and instead helps Z and the worker ants. Enraged, Mandible rushes to kill Cutter, but Z pushes Cutter out of the way and is accidentally tackled into the flooded colony with Mandible, who lands upon a root, killing him on impact. Cutter orders the soldiers to help the workers and the Queen Ant while he himself goes after Z. Although Z has seemingly drowned, Bala resuscitates him.  Z is praised for his heroism and marries Bala. Together they rebuild the colony, transforming it from a conformist military state into a community that values all of its members. The camera zooms out to reveal the whole story took place in the middle of [[Central Park]], [[New York City]].

Harry insists he will need his full team to help execute NASA's plan, and they agree to help but only after their list of unusual rewards are met.  NASA plans to launch two specialized [[Space Shuttle orbiter]]s, the X-71s, ''Freedom'' and ''Independence'', to increase the chances of success; the shuttles will refill with [[liquid oxygen]] from the 11-year-old Russian space station ''[[Mir]]'' (which is modified to have [[artificial gravity]] by rotating on itself) before making a [[Gravity assist|slingshot maneuver]] around the Moon to approach the asteroid from behind. NASA puts Harry and his crew through a short and rigorous astronaut training program, while Harry's team re-outfit the mobile drillers, "Armadillos", for the job. During training, Truman and Harry are skeptical about the abilities of A.J. Frost, a hot-headed drill operator who has been dating Harry's daughter Grace against Harry's wishes.  The destruction of [[Shanghai]] by a meteorite forces the government to reveal the asteroid's existence, as well as their plan. The shuttles are launched and arrive at the space station, where its sole cosmonaut Lev Andropov helps with refueling. A major fire breaks out during the fueling process, forcing the crews, including Lev, to evacuate in the shuttles before the station explodes. The shuttles perform the slingshot around the Moon, but approaching the asteroid, the ''Independence'''s engines are destroyed by trailing debris, and it crash-lands on the asteroid. Grace, aware A.J. was aboard the ''Independence'', is traumatized by this news, believing he was killed. Unknown to the others, A.J., Lev, and "Bear" (another of Harry's crew) survive the impact and head towards the ''Freedom'' target site in their Armadillo.  ''Freedom'' manages to land on the asteroid, but overshoots the target zone, landing on a much harder metallic field than planned, and their drilling quickly falls behind schedule. The military initiates a backup plan they call "secondary protocol", planning to remotely detonate the weapon at the asteroid's surface, despite Truman and Harry's insistence that it would be ineffective. Truman delays the military, while Harry convinces the shuttle commander Colonel Willie Sharp to disarm the remote trigger. Harry's crew continues to work, but in their haste, they accidentally hit a gas pocket, blowing their Armadillo into space and losing another man. As the world learns of the mission's apparent failure, another meteorite decimates most of [[Paris]].  All seems lost until ''Independence'''s Armadillo arrives. With A.J. at the controls, they reach the required depth for the bomb. However, flying debris from the asteroid damages the triggering device, requiring someone to stay behind to manually detonate the bomb. The crew [[drawing straws|draw straws]] and A.J. is selected. As he and Harry exit the airlock, Harry rips off A.J.'s air hose and shoves him back inside, telling him that he is the son Harry never had and gives his blessing to marry Grace. Harry contacts Grace to bid his final farewell. After some last minute difficulties involving both the shuttle engines and the detonator, the ''Freedom'' moves to a safe distance and Harry triggers the detonation while his life flashes before his eyes. The bomb successfully splits the asteroid, avoiding the collision with Earth. ''Freedom'' safely returns to Earth, and the surviving crew is treated as heroes. A.J. and Grace get married, with photos of Harry and the other lost crew members present.  
Apt Pupil (film)
 In [[Southern California]] in 1984, 16-year-old high school student Todd Bowden (Renfro) discovers that his elderly neighbor, Arthur Denker (McKellen), is in reality Kurt Dussander&nbsp;— a former [[Sturmbannführer]] in the [[SS]] who is now a fugitive [[war crime|war criminal]] hiding from justice. Todd blackmails Dussander by threatening to turn him in to the police. However, the teenager is fascinated with [[Nazi]] atrocities perpetrated during World War II, and forces Dussander to share disturbing stories of what it was like working at Nazi [[extermination camp]]s, and how it felt to participate in [[genocide]].   Todd purchases an SS uniform from a costume shop, and forces Dussander to wear it. When he spends more time with the old man, his grades suffer, he loses interest in his girlfriend, and he conceals his bad grades from his parents. In turn, the Nazi blackmails the young boy into studying to restore his grades, threatening to expose the boy's subterfuge and his dalliance with Nazism to his parents. Dussander even poses as Todd's grandfather and goes to an appointment with Todd's school counselor Edward French ([[David Schwimmer]]). Talking about the war crimes affects both the old man and the young boy, and an intoxicated Dussander [[Cruelty to animals|attempts to kill a cat]] in his gas oven but fails when it attacks him and escapes. Dussander also takes great pride in Todd's unbelievable turnaround, going from near dropout to straight As in a matter of weeks.  One night, Dussander tries to kill a hobo who earlier had seen him in the uniform. When Dussander has a [[heart attack]], he calls Todd, who finishes the job, cleans up, and calls an ambulance for Dussander. At the hospital, Dussander is recognized by a death camp survivor sharing his room and he is arrested, prior to being extradited to [[Israel]]. Todd graduates as his school's [[valedictorian]] and gives a speech about [[Icarus]], saying, "All great achievements arose from dissatisfaction. It is the desire to do better, to dig deeper, that propels civilization to greatness." The scene is juxtaposed in a montage with Dussander's home being searched and the hobo's corpse being found in the basement.  Todd is briefly questioned about his relationship with Dussander, but he manages to convince the police that he knew nothing of the old man's true identity. At the hospital, Dussander hears a group of [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazis]] demonstrating outside the hospital; realizing his identity has been hopelessly compromised, he commits suicide by giving himself an [[air embolism]]. When French learns that the man who met Todd at school was not Todd's grandfather but a war criminal, he confronts Todd, who then blackmails him into silence by threatening to accuse him of making inappropriate sexual advances towards him, and to thereby expose him publicly as a homosexual and pederast.

Arrival II
  This film takes place two years after the first film. Zane Zaminski (the protagonist from ''[[The Arrival (1996 film)|The Arrival]]'') is found dead in a remote Eskimo community. It is believed that he died of a heart attack. His broadcast to the world about the aliens is believed to have been a UFO hoax due to his dismissal from NASA (this despite Earth continuing to have record temperatures). As his death is announced on TV, five people receive envelopes with details of an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] invasion. This group of five consists of three scientists, Zane's step brother Jack Addison (a computer expert whom he has not seen in seven years), and a reporter named Bridget Riordan. They receive papers talking of global warming and of aliens terraforming Earth into a planet hot like their own dying world.  The group gets together in a large freezer (as the aliens can't stand cold) to see what Zane has left them. They find some alien artifacts in an envelope left to the group. One of the five, Trevor Anguilar, suffers from the cold and is revealed as an alien. He sets off a metal sphere (a "[[black hole bomb]]" or BHB as it rises into the air, revolves then sucks everything in a large area into it, causing it to vanish permanently). The alien and one of the men, Tom Billings, are sucked into the BHB's area of influence as well as the contents of the room but Addison, Riordan and Zarcoff manage to escape.  Zarcoff in his hotel room is killed by an alien metal spider machine which injects him, making it look like his death was from a heart attack. Addison goes back to his rooms to find a BHB has cleared them of everything. Sandra Wolfe, a girl he picked up and slept with last night turns out to be an alien. She and another alien, Wotan, inject Addison and he later wakes up to find himself being "taken for a ride".  Addison rolls out of the car and despite terrible disorientation manages to elude them and team up with Riordan again. The aliens have set the FBI on the two as well as cancelling their credit cards and emptying Addison's bank account of $15,000. The pair have only one artifact left and that produces a perfect 3D hologram when a laser beam is shone through it. They use it to find out that an atomic power plant due to be opened near where they are in Quebec is in the hands of the aliens. Later it is revealed that it is to go critical and will spread deadly radiation over many hundreds of miles (the aliens are immune to radiation).  Addison and Riordan attempt to show the hologram at a climate seminar, and Addison's boss, Burke, agrees to help them. But before they can activate the device, they are caught by Dave Cyrus, another of Addison's co-workers who has sold them out to the FBI. Burke kills Cyrus and frames Addison for it, revealing himself to be an alien as well. Barely escaping, Addison and Riordan break into a university and use an industrial laser to properly activate the artifact  Addison uses his computer skills to walk around and interact with an alien ship in space and to program a giant BHB deep below the power plant to go off in one hour. The aliens arrive and both are captured from the hologram. In the atomic power station, their time seems to be up till the giant BHB goes off in the alien area below it and starts ripping apart and swallowing the atomic power station. Wotan and Wolfe are dragged through the gaping hole in the floor. Nearly dragged into its sphere of influence himself, Addison uses a small BHB to stop the giant one long enough for he and Riordan to escape. They just make it as all that is left of the power station is a huge hole in the ground. Burke also survives, but injured, his alien features partly visible. He warns Addison that the aliens haven't been stopped, just delayed.  Some time later, Riordan's book ''Alien Agenda'' (which details their recent adventures as well as the alien's plans for the world) is still top of the [[New York Times best seller list| ''New York Times'' best seller list]]s after 2 months. The world still seems to consider it all fiction. The film ends with the married couple driving to Alaska and it is just beginning to snow as they cross the border, which suits them fine.

She decides to enter Babe and they leave the farm together.  At the airport in the city of Metropolis, a sniffer dog falsely detects that Babe and Esme are accused of carrying illegal substances. Airport security officers interrogate them, causing them to miss their connecting flight. An airport cleaner informs them about a hotel that is suitable for accommodating animals, so Esme and Babe go there.

Next, we see Dr. Emma Peel ([[Uma Thurman]]) at home where she receives a phone call telling her to go to a gentlemen's club - no women allowed - where she meets Steed for the first time. The two head off to the Ministry to meet [[Mother (The Avengers)|Mother]] ([[Jim Broadbent]]), who informs them  the Prospero project - an attempt to influence the weather - was sabotaged apparently by Emma Peel. Dr. Peel claims she is innocent, but she is sent to work alongside Steed to find the real culprit. Mother's off-sider, [[Father (The Avengers)|Father]] ([[Fiona Shaw]]), claims Peel suffers from a mental disease. They go off to visit Sir August De Wynter ([[Sean Connery]]), an old ally of The Ministry. He takes an instant liking to Peel, as they both share a love of weather.  Steed and Emma follow a lead to Wonderland Weather - a business that artificially creates heat or rain with a special machine - where they discover two dead men in teddy bear suits. The members of a secret organization — led by De Wynter — all wear teddy bear suits to disguise their identities. One of them, however, looks exactly like Emma Peel. Steed arrives in time to save Peel, as the double jumps off a roof and disappears.  Steed and Emma go off to visit De Wynter at his mansion, but are attacked by mechanical bees. Alice ([[Eileen Atkins]]), a Ministry agent, helps them to flee; nevertheless, De Wynter captures Emma who then tries to escape but finds herself trapped due to the mansion's ever-changing floor plan. She smashes her way through a window, and Steed rescues her. Back at Steed's apartment, however, Peel is arrested by Father, as Steed visits Invisible Jones ([[Patrick MacNee]]), a man inside The Ministry, to investigate the meaning of a map Steed found at Wonderland Weather.  After viewing some photos of failed genetic experiments including cloning (revealing that the other Emma Peel is a clone), Steed determines Father is working with De Wynter. Father and Peel's clone capture Peel but are confronted by Mother, who is then incapacitated. De Wynter, controlling Prospero and the weather, confronts the world's leaders. He boasts that he controls the weather, and they will have to buy the weather from him, will pay a lot for it, and will have until midnight to pay.  Father and Peel's clone take Emma to a [[hot air balloon]], where Emma escapes during a snowstorm. Father and the clone perish when the balloon crashes and explodes. Invisible Jones determines De Wynter is using the Prospero instruments on a secret island, and Peel and Steed arrive at the island to stop him. Emma defuses the Prospero device just as a hurricane forms over London. Steed duels De Wynter and eventually gains the upper hand by impaling him with his own cane, causing De Wynter to be struck by a bolt of lightning. Emma and Steed escape just as the base self-destructs, and share champagne on the roof of a building with Mother.

Somehow, Jeeva knows the truth and claimed to be proud to become Divya’s husband. This distracts Prithvi, who then decides to stop the marriage.  What can Janaki do to stop Prithvi? She poisons him and kills herself too for the sake of a peaceful life for Divya.

Bad Company (manga)
 ''Bad Company'' is made up of two parts, each dedicated in part to how Eikichi Onizuka and Ryuji Danma meet and get their motorcycles.  ===Part I=== The story is told from Ryuji's point of view, it begins when Ryuji is trying to avoid attending class at his new school and by chance witnesses the end of a fight that Onizuka has just won. Haunted by the demonic expression on his eyes while his face is covered in blood he becomes obsessed with seeing it again, sure that one day they will have a fight from which only one of them will survive.  To his surprise, he discovers that not only he is in the same school as Onizuka but in the same class as well. Wanting to be the strongest in the school, he tries several times to bring out the demon out again, but soon realizes that Onizuka won't be angered by teenage bravados, although the rest of the bad-asses in the school are soon under his command. Ryuji never gets the fight he desires with him (or at least at the level he desires).  Sakura Yamato, a girl in Onizuka's group of friends tries to show Ryuji Onizuka's true face, and so walks him to the garage where Onizuka, Fukitoshi and Isami are mending a bike they found in a dump, which happens to be the [[Kawasaki Z400GP]] that Onizuka drives in the sequels. Sakura tells Ryuji that Onizuka is not the kind of person to be interested in power or who is better, he only wants to have a good time with his friends. Ryuji rejects it at first, again trying to pick a fight but is slowly won over and helps them in repairing the bike.  The next day, Sakura, Ryuji and Onizuka have gone for food to celebrate just before trying the bike, but when they are back, the bike has disappeared and Fukitoshi and Isami are beaten on the floor. It turns out that the Skull Gang also had their eyes set on the bike, and so have waited for it to be repaired so they can sell it at a good price. Onizuka quickly goes to recover it, and is followed by Ryuji. Onizuka fights the leader of the Skulls for his bike, but the fight is interrupted by Sakura, who has brought the Running Wild Angels, another ''[[bōsōzoku]]'' gang, whose leader, Masaki, becomes their role-model. After seeing the fight, Masaki asks Onizuka and the others to ride with them next time they meet.  ===Part II=== The boys have just found a porn magazine vending machine, and are trying to be bold enough to go and buy one, but to no avail, somebody always passes by. A woman approaches and buys one, with no sign of hesitation, then gets into her car and drives dangerously close to them saying that no one who has seen a woman purchase a porn magazine can be left alive, but then laughs it off as a joke. The woman's name is Natsuki, and she drives them around town.  Meanwhile, Ryuji is just entranced by her femininity, and as his parents have locked him out of the house, ends up sleeping at her apartment. She tells him that her parents used to do the same thing, and so, they are very similar. The next day she gives him the [[Honda CBX]] she used to own. That night they go driving with the Running Wild Angels, everybody is very surprised, Onizuka is jealous and Ryuji leads the way. Masaki recognizes the bike and it turns out that Natsuki used to be one of them.  The next morning Ryuji goes again to Natsuki's house and finds she has been beaten by her boyfriend, Nezu Akira, who also bullies him. Now Ryuji has to pay him an enormous amount of money or he will be killed, since the CBX used to belong to him. After more threats, Ryuji goes again to Natsuki's house, intending to kill him with a suspension bar.  
Bandhan (1998 film)
 Thakur Suraj Pratap ([[Jackie Shroff]]) sees a young woman performing pooja at a temple, and instantly falls in love with her. This is Pooja ([[Ashwini Bhave]]), who belongs to a poor family, consisting of her dad, Ramlal, her mom and a kid brother named Raju ([[Salman Khan]]). Thakur sends an emissary to Ramlal, who is delighted to give his daughter to Thakur in marriage, and the wedding is celebrated with due ceremony. Pooja is very fond of Raju, and takes him along with her to her husband's house. This is the only "gift" that Pooja's impoverished parents are able to give their daughter at the wedding, and it is also beneficial for the young boy to grow up in a more affluent household. At the Thakur's palatial home, Pooja is greeted by Jyoti ([[Rambha (actress)|Rambha]]), Thakur's kid sister.  The years pass. Unfortunately, Pooja has been unable to bear children. Raju, now grown up, is intensely attached and loyal to Thakur, his brother-in-law. He and Thakur's sister Jyoti are in love. One day, Thakur meets Vaishali ([[Shweta Menon]]), a courtesan who sings and dances for a living. Vaishali has no relatives except one brother, an unscrupulous card-sharp named Gajendra who lives off his sister's earnings. Vaishali seduces the Thakur and becomes his mistress. Her brother, posing as a respectable man, demands that Thakur marry Vaishali and make the relationship public. Thakur is reluctant. On the one hand, he possibly hopes that Vaishali will make him a father. On the other hand, he is attached to his dutiful wife and loving brother-in-law. Gajendra and his friends hatch a plot to kill two birds with one stone: to induce Thakur to marry Vaishali, and at the same time, break the strong relationship between Thakur and Raju. The conspirators make a fool of Raju, as a result of which he causes the police to raid Gajendra's house, on the allegation that the house is being used as a brothel. During the police raid, Raju is horrified to find that the 'customer' found in Vaishali's company is none other than his brother-in-law. Thakur is also angered to find that the person who has caused him this infamy and police entanglement is none other than Raju. In order to avoid legal proceedings, Thakur tells the police that he is present in the house in order to discuss the possibility of marrying Vaishali, reason being that his wife has remained childless. Raju falls at Thakur's feet, begs forgiveness, and pleads with him not to take a second wife. His pleas fall on deaf ears; Thakur duly marries Vaishali and takes her home. Raju tells his parents of what has happened, of how Pooja now has a co-wife. They come to Thakur's mansion and create a scene. Annoyed at the commotion, Thakur tells Pooja to make her choice once and for all: she can either accept Vaishali as her co-wife and remain in his household with the respectability of being the senior wife, or depart with her parents for good. Pooja chooses to remain with her husband and co-wife, for as she says, that is her wifely duty; her husband's house is the only suitable residence for a married woman. Raju, who has lived in Thakur's household for many years, now goes away with his parents.  These events cause a great rift between the two families, because of which the two lovers (Raju and Jyoti) are separated. Vaishali is ensconced in the Thakur's mansion, and her brother becomes Thakur's confidant. He now wants to marry Thakur's sister Jyoti, so that he and his sister Vaishali will totally control the vast wealth of the Thakur family. A naïve Thakur is taken in by his new brother-in-law's seeming decency, and it is arranged that Gajendra will marry Jyoti. However, Jyoti bravely refuses to marry anyone except Raju. She is supported by Pooja, who makes the point that it would be wrong and even sinful for Jyoti to marry one man while being in love with another; chasteness of the mind is as important as chasteness of the body.  Thakur decides to delay the matter for the time being. Gajendra is aghast at this, and makes a plan to abduct Jyoti, so that afterwards she will have no choice but to marry him. He reveals his plan to his sister and asks her to help him, but Vaishali has undergone a personality change after her marriage. She now wants to be a respectable woman, and is extremely grateful to Thakur for having given her the chance to reform. She berates and opposes her brother, and makes it clear that she will inform her husband. Gajendra feels betrayed by his sister and sees that she has gained so much (Thakur's wealth, his social standing and the respectability of wifehood), whereas he, Gajendra, has in fact lost his only source of income, which was the money from his sister's song-and-dance performances. In a fit of rage, he plunges a knife into Vaishali's stomach and kills her. He then makes an effort to frame Thakur for Vaishali's murder. There are some further (rather incomprehensible) shenanigans until, in the climax, Thakur realizes that he has been used and manipulated, and also that Raju (the hero of the film), is the epitome of goodness, loyalty, affection and every noble human quality. At Thakur's behest, Raju dispatches the villains, rescues Jyoti and protects Thakur's honour, gamely taking a bullet in the shoulder during the Big Fight. He survives to dance another song, and Thakur, now reconciled with his beloved and loyal Raju, gives Jyoti in marriage to him. The two couples live happily ever after, with great love existing both within each couple and between the two couples.

All the while, Baby Bop is looking for her small, yellow blanket, and B.J. and Baby Bop arrive just in time to see the egg hatch.  After they return the egg to the barn, it finally hatches into a koala-like being named Twinken who shows everyone Abby's dream and then Barney's.

BASEketball
 Joe "Coop" Cooper and Doug Remer, both aged 23 and unemployed, arrive uninvited at a party hosted by a former high school classmate; they are shunned by their more mature (and successful) classmates. Coop and Remer find themselves outside drinking beer and shooting basketball when two classmates challenge them to a game. After seeing that their opponents are very good at basketball, they say they will only play a game they picked up in the streets (while secretly inventing the rules as they play, based on both basketball and baseball). After winning, they decide to refine the rules to the game and Coop makes the first BASEketball out of a [[La-Z-Boy]] chair. Their friend, Kenny "Squeak" Scolari, tags along and the sport becomes very popular in the neighborhood over the next six months.  Businessman Ted Denslow meets Coop and Remer and proposes the creation of the National BASEketball League (NBL) along with numerous rules in place to prevent its decline: teams cannot switch cities, players cannot be traded, individuals cannot make money via corporate sponsorship deals, and it is completely open to anyone who wants to play, with Denslow stating that "anyone can be a sports' hero". Coop initially hesitates, but quickly accepts the opportunity at hand.  Five years later, the NBL is in full swing with teams, fans, stadiums, and a major championship, the Denslow Cup. Denslow is owner of the Milwaukee Beers, Coop and Remer's team. During the championship game, Denslow dies from choking on a hot dog, causing Coop to miss his shot and costing the Beers the game. Denslow's [[Will and testament|will]] names Coop as owner of the Beers for one year on the condition that they win the next Denslow Cup; otherwise, ownership reverts to Denslow's widow Yvette. Coop declares Remer part owner of the team, and they come to meet Jenna Reed, head of the Dream Come True Foundation, and Joey, one of the children in her care and an avid fan of BASEketball.  Baxter Cain, owner of the Dallas Felons, wants to remove Denslow's rules preventing [[monetization]] of the sport, but could not while Denslow was alive. However, Coop refuses to accept any changes; Cain partners with Yvette as he tries to make the Beers lose the next Denslow Cup so she will own the team.  Cain cuts the funding to Jenna's foundation to get Coop and Remer to adopt a clothing line; Coop is against it, but Remer agrees and becomes obsessed with his newfound status. After the semifinals, Cain informs Coop and Remer that the clothing line has been produced through [[child labor]] in [[Calcutta]]; if the public finds out, the team and Jenna's foundation will be ruined. Cain blackmails Coop and Remer into losing or forfeiting the Denslow Cup game or he will inform the public. Jenna learns about the scandal and breaks up with Coop as Coop and Remer blame each other for the predicament.  With their friendship in shambles, Coop goes to Calcutta, aiming to resolve the situation by replacing the child workers with adults. Making it back to the championship game just as it begins, Coop still blames Remer and the Beers perform abysmally; by the seventh-inning stretch, the Beers are down 16–0. Having had enough of Coop and Remer's fighting, Squeak gives the stadium a passionate speech, reminding Coop and Remer where they came from, how much they changed everyone else's lives, and what they risk losing. Moved, Coop and Remer reconcile their differences as Yvette breaks off her alliance with Cain. After shifting their focus back in the game, they are poised to win when Coop's La-Z-Boy pops. Coop is distraught until Joey brings him a new BASEketball made from a [[Barcalounger]]. After a harrowing last throw, they win the Denslow Cup. Jenna forgives Coop as Yvette makes out with Remer.

After punishing the submarine crew by freezing them with his trusted freeze gun, Freeze returns to [[Gotham City]] with his companions and enlists the help of his old colleague Dr. Gregory Belson to find a cure. Belson determines that Nora needs an organ transplant, but due to her rare blood type there are no suitable donors available.

Back in Gotham, [[Bruce Wayne]] (Batman) and Dick investigate Barbara's kidnapping and learn that Belson is also missing. From a telephone conversation between Belson and his broker, Dean Arbagast, Batman and Robin discover where Freeze has taken both Barbara and Belson, and learn of the organ transplant from a list of equipment Belson left behind.

Nora, Koonak and Barbara are put safely aboard the waiting Batwing with Robin piloting it, but despite his efforts, Batman is unable to save Freeze from plummeting into the ocean to his apparent death. Batman makes it back to the Batwing, and they fly away just as the oil rig finally explodes, though Freeze is revealed to have survived and escapes with his polar bears.  Sometime later, Freeze returns with his polar bears to the Arctic to resume his life alone, having frozen his leg in an ice cast.

Leo has a complicated personal history with some of the guests and hides in his bedroom, feeling grumpy and old. The movie then goes into an extended flashback which explains this history.  It turns out that his colleague had encouraged Leo to attend his weekly men's group run by New Age type goofball Keith ([[Simon Callow]]) whose wife is Sybil ([[Harriet Walter]]). There, Leo meets hunky Irishman Brendan ([[James Purefoy]]) whom he develops a crush on, which he reluctantly reveals to the group.

In the men's group, one of the other groupsmen become very jealous of Leo's "friendship" with Brendan and that he does not have that with Leo. Brendan fights with the lad over Leo. The friendship is soon to become more, as Brendan appears unexpectedly late one night at Leo's door and sleeps with him; after which they become something of a couple, to the consternation of one man in their men's group, though it encourages another, Terry ([[Con O'Neill (actor)|Con O'Neill]]), to explore his sexuality.  Meanwhile, flamboyant Darren has met real estate agent Jeremy ([[Hugo Weaving]]), who gets a kick out of having sex in houses for sale he has been given the keys to. However, he is not interested into "couply" things, despite Darren's attempts. Eventually this leads to them having sex with handcuffs and blindfolds in the bedroom of the house which Sally has on the market, during which she unexpectedly returns home. Jeremy abandons Darren, who dumps him. Leo gets close once more with Sally, and ends up kissing her. Feeling guilty, he leaves in a panic, and ends up telling Brendan what happened, who goes ballistic as he still has feelings for Sally. Leo finds himself in a quandary, and decides to confess to Sally that he is the one who is seeing Brendan (Sally had previously believed it was Leo's roommate Angie). He inadvertently does so while Brendan is there too, and leaves Brendan to face Sally.  The film then returns to the party, where Brendan and Terry get into an argument over Leo and take it outside, where Brendan punches Terry on the nose, who crumples. Brendan asks him to go with him for a drink (the same tactic he had employed with Leo). Thus, Brendan starts dating; Leo's colleague and Angie get together; Jeremy and Darren make up; and Leo sleeps with Sally.  
Beast Cops
 Tung (Anthony Wong) is a street cop in [[Hong Kong]] who is friends with a [[Triad (underground society)|triad]] ''dai lo'' named Fai (Roy Cheung). Fai hires a hitman to murder a business rival; the hit goes wrong and Fai, implicated in the incident, goes on the run. This leaves Tung in the put upon position to look after Fai's affairs.  Soon, however, Tung's squad is assigned a new Commanding Officer in the form of Lieutenant Michael Cheung (Michael Wong), a no-nonsense, tough as nails cop who was transferred for having punched out his own previous Commanding Officer. In an attempt to keep tabs on Cheung and similarly introduce him to their precinct Tung takes Cheung to the disco owned by Fai. There, Cheung meets a madam named Yoyo (whose name in dubbed version is sometimes given as [[Yo-Yo Ma]]), who is also Fai's moll. Angry and upset that Fai left on such short notice without her, Yoyo accepts Cheung's overture and the two soon find themselves genuinely in love.  In the meantime Fai's eager underling, Push-pin, moves himself into Fai's role and attempts to force Yoyo to peddle customers drugs through her escorts. Yoyo refuses, an action which results in Push-Pin slapping her across the face. Cheung finds out and takes revenge by inspecting Push-Pin's establishments every night.  As Cheung and Yoyo's relationship turns serious, Tung finds his own relationship with a married woman turning sour. She routinely asks him for money [note: seems she's paying him for sex], which leaves him constantly broke. When Push-pin realizes slapping Yoyo has resulted in Cheung becoming an enemy, Push-pin hands Tung a handful of money, "as a gift." Actually, this act is a bribe, and when Cheung is later attacked by a group of Push-pin's men and Tung, having made the connection, attempts to bring Push-pin in, Push-pin reminds Tung of the money he'd given him. Tung finds himself powerless to arrest Push-pin without exposing himself as having been bribed.  Things come to a head when Fai returns to town and learns that Yoyo is seeing Cheung. Fai goes after Cheung; their fight leads to a standoff with Tung between them, and Yoyo proclaiming she and Cheung are in love and are having a baby. Fai storms off, followed by Tung. The two decide it's time to pay a visit to Push-pin, who has now been officially promoted by the area's lead triad boss, Tai, into Fai's place as ''dai lo''.  While Tung waits outside the disco, Fai goes in to confront Push-pin. After an emotional confrontation, Push-pin chops Fai in the neck with a machete, killing him.

Beast Wars II: Lio Convoy's Close Call!
 In Gaia’s atmosphere, the Jointrons and the Seacons battle each other but both factions are interrupted by the arrival of a large space ship which rams into them and sends them all flying into space before crash landing on the planet, and the Maximals and Predacons are immediately alerted. On the Galvaburg II, Gigastorm recommends destroying the ship but Galvatron is interested and believes it may hold good fortune for the Predacons. On the Yukikaze Lio Convoy orders a unit sent to investigate the ship but Lio Junior, Lio Convoy’s son, wishes to go but the other Maximals shoot him down, but Tasmania Kid stands up for him and asks if both can go and Lio Convoy approves and has Stanton and Skywarp accompany also. The 4 Maximals arrive at the ship and discover a “teleport gate”, an ancient device capable of opening a doorway into the past and transporting any living creature into the present, Transformers included but it requires a control unit to function. When Lio Junior finds it the Predacon Combaticons Hellscream, Dirgegun, Thrustor and Max-B swoop in and steals it but Lio Junior dives off after it alone and the Predacons overpower and nearly kill him, but before Hellscream can fire a finishing blow Kid takes the hit as the other Maximals arrive and scare off the Predacons and secure the control unit.  When Kid doesn’t respond to medical treatment the other Maximals blame Lio Junior for his condition and he becomes mad at them as they have the ship and the control unit, and is frustrated of not having any respect. Lio Convoy though agrees with his troops and scolds Lio Junior’s actions calling him reckless, impatient and is more concerned with destroying Predacons, not protecting innocent lives as per the Maximals code. Lio Junior though snaps and runs off vowing to kill the Predacons himself but forgetting to return the control unit first. As the Maximals return to their ship to tend to Kid’s wounds Dirgegun informs Galvatron how the machine works and seeking advantage of Lio Junior’s feud with his father, seeks him out and deceives him. He tells Lio Junior that the Predacons accidentally activated the teleport gate and it will self-destruct in under an hour and destroy the whole planet unless the control unit is returned. A barely functioning Tasmania Kid however arrives and begs Lio Junior not to trust him but Galvatron knocks him out and despite his hatred for Galvatron, Lio Junior accompanies him back to the Galvaburg to shut down the machine, and to prove his worth to the Maximals, but once Galvatron has the control unit he drops the facade and has Lio Junior imprisoned in the ship. Galvatron announces his intention to the Predacons, and Lio Junior, to summon the Predacon Megatron from the Beast Wars on pre-historic Earth (set during ''Beast Wars'') to assist him destroying the Maximals.  After Kid awakens and returns to the Maximal’s ship he informs Lio Convoy of his son’s defection and Galvatron having possession of the control unit so Lio Convoy orders the Maximals to rescue his son and stop Galvatron from activating the teleport gate. Before doing so Lio Convoy expresses a deep resentment for his son’s actions but Kid begs him not to treat him so harshly as he is just young, and Lio Convoy eases up. Elsewhere Gigastorm activates the teleport gate to summon Megatron but miscalculates and instead summons the colossal Decepticon giant Majin Zarak but due to his immense strength and arsenal of weapons Galvatron is even more pleased. Galvatron assumes command of the seemingly mindless giant and transforms him into aircraft carrier mode and takes Hellscream, Max-B and the Autorollers to face down the Maximals while Dirgegun and Thrustor guard Lio Junior.   The Maximals detect the arrival of Majin Zarak, much to their horror, and prepare to face him using a small shuttle but Zarak’s firepower proves too intense to evade and they regroup for a land ambush. Meanwhile, Lio Junior escapes as Stanton and Skywarp arrive and Lio Junior apologises for his rash behaviour and asks them to accompany him to the teleport gate, as he plans to even the odds. They agree and the trio combine into Magnaboss who easily defeats Thrustor and Dirgegun but not before the former delivers a fatal blow to his chest and with his last ounce of strength, Magnaboss uses his own spark energy to activate the teleport gate and summon someone else to assist them.  In a canyon Lio Convoy leads the other Maximals against the Predacons, using Majin Zarak as their new base.The Maximals are able to force Hellscream, Max-B and the Autorollers into retreating but Galvatron and Gigastorm continue to have Zarak attack them and though Lio Convoy is able to defeat Gigastorm, Galvatron eventually unveils Zarak’s robot mode to deliver a massive energy burst to vaporise the area and believing all the present Maximals to be destroyed but receives a call from a “Convoy” challenging him to another fight in “Point B-2”. Believing Lio Convoy to have sent the message Galvatron accepts and takes Majin Zarak to the point. Underground however a barely conscious Lio Convoy is contacted by a familiar voice who informs him that his son nearly killed himself to summon him to the present time and praises Lio Convoy’s abilities as a commander and asks to team up, one commander to another.  When Lio Convoy wakes up he discovers every Maximals has survived the blast, including a fully recovered Tasmania Kid, and Lio Convoy apologises to Magnaboss for mistreating him and is praised for his selfless act and is introduced to the legendary former Maximal commander from the past: Optimus Primal who agrees to follow Lio Convoy’s lead into battle against Galvatron and Majin Zarak. Magnaboss begs to participate also but Lio Convoy forbids it with his injuries but Kid persuades to him to change his mind when he merges with Magnaboss to give him his needed strength back. Galvatron and Majin Zarak arrive at Point B-2 but Galvatron is enraged to learn that it wasn’t Lio Convoy who sent the call but Optimus and attempts to kill both of them, but is stopped by Magnaboss who tosses Zarak and throws Galvatron out of his ship-mode and is saved by Gigastorm but vows revenge.  With Majin Zarak inoperable the battle appears won but Zarak transforms on his own will revealing he has a sentience of his own and was never under Galvatron’s control to begin with, and attacks the Maximals using numerous attack methods and severely injuring Bighorn and Apache, Kid and Magnaboss leaving only Lio Convoy and Optimus to fight Majin Zarak. However Scuba and Diver learn that Zarak’s weakness is his third eye as his nerve clusters are gathered there and as Zarak moves in to kill both commanders they combine their Energon Matrix powers and immensely power each other up as they launch a combined attack against Zarak and kill him. After the battle Optimus prepares to return to his own time in the Beast Wars on pre-historic Earth, Gaia’s pastime counterpart, and though the other Maximals beg him to stay Optimus knows his presence will endanger existence itself, supported by Apache's theory that the civilization who created the teleport gate sent it to Gaia preciously to be destroyed. Before leaving Optimus commends Lio Convoy and the other Maximals for their unity and accomplishment and is honoured to have battled alongside them, and departs back to his own time as Lio Convoy orders the teleport gate destroyed behind him to prevent its power from being abused again.  
Beloved (1998 film)
 Sethe is a former [[slave]] living on the outskirts of [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] shortly after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. An angry [[poltergeist]] terrorizes Sethe and her three children, causing her two sons to run away forever. Eight years later, Sethe ([[Oprah Winfrey]]) lives alone with her daughter, Denver ([[Kimberly Elise]]). Paul D. ([[Danny Glover]]), an old friend from Sweet Home, the [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] Sethe had escaped from years earlier, finds Sethe's home, where he drives off the angry spirit that inhabits it. Afterwards, Paul D. proposes that he should stay and Sethe responds favorably. Shortly after Paul D. moves in, a clean and seemingly mentally handicapped young woman ([[Thandie Newton]]) named Beloved finds her way into Sethe's yard and is taken in by her.  Denver is initially happy to have Beloved around, but learns that she is Sethe's [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] daughter. Nonetheless, she chooses not to divulge Beloved's origins to Sethe. One night, Beloved, aware that Paul D. dislikes her, immobilizes him with a spell and proceeds to rape him. Paul D. resolves to tell Sethe what happened, but instead tells what has happened to a co-worker, Stamp Paid ([[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]]). Stamp Paid, who has known Sethe for many years, pulls a newspaper clipping featuring Sethe and tells her story to the illiterate Paul D.  Years ago, Sethe was raped by the nephews of Schoolteacher, the owner of Sweet Home. She complained to Mrs. Garner, Schoolteacher's sister-in-law, who confronted him. In retaliation, Schoolteacher and his nephews brutally whip Sethe, leaving a "tree" of keloid scars on her back. Heavily pregnant with her fourth child, Sethe planned to escape. Her other children were sent off earlier to live with Baby Suggs, Sethe's mother-in-law, but Sethe stayed behind to look for her husband, Halle ([[Hill Harper]]). Sethe was assaulted while searching for him in the barn. The Schoolteacher's nephews held her down, raped her and forcibly took her breast milk.  When Halle failed to comply, Sethe ran off alone. She crossed paths with Amy Denver, a white girl who treated Sethe's injuries and delivered Sethe's child, whom Sethe named Denver after Amy. Sethe eventually reached Baby Suggs' home, but her initial happiness was short-lived when Schoolteacher came to claim Sethe and her children. In desperation, Sethe slits her older daughter's throat, and attempts to kill her other children. Stamp Paid manages to stop her and the disgusted Schoolteacher departs.  Paul D., horrified by the revelation and suddenly understanding the origin of the poltergeist, confronts Sethe. Sethe justifies her decision without apology, claiming that her children would be better off dead than enslaved. Paul D. departs shortly thereafter in protest. After Paul D.'s departure, Sethe realizes that Beloved is the reincarnation of her dead daughter. Feeling elated yet guilty, Sethe spoils Beloved with elaborate gifts while neglecting Denver. Beloved soon throws a destructive tantrum and her malevolent presence causes living conditions in the house to deteriorate. The women live in squalor and Sethe is unable to work. Denver becomes depressed yet, inspired by a memory of her grandmother's confidence in her, she eventually musters the courage to leave the house and seek employment.  After Denver attains employment, women from the local church visit Sethe's house at the request of her new co-worker to perform an [[exorcism]]. The women from the church comfort the family, and they are praying and singing loudly when Denver's new employer arrives to pick her up for work. Sethe sees him and, reminded of Schoolteacher's arrival, tries to attack him with an icepick, but is subdued by Denver and the women. During the commotion, Beloved disappears completely and Sethe, freed from Beloved's grip, becomes permanently bedridden.  Some months later, Paul D. encounters Denver at the marketplace. He notices she has transformed into a confident and mature young woman. When Paul D. later arrives at Sethe's house, he finds her suffering from a deep malaise. He assures Sethe that he and Denver will now take care of her. Sethe tells him that she doesn't see the point, as Beloved, her "best thing", is gone. Paul D. disagrees, telling Sethe that she herself is her own best thing.  
Belly (film)
 The film begins in early 1999, with two young [[Queens]], [[New York City|New York]] street criminals Tommy "Buns" Bundy ([[DMX (rapper)|DMX]]) and Sincere ("Sin") ([[Nas]]), along with their associates in crime Mark and Black. The four violently rob a nightclub, murdering five people. Escaping in a stolen car, they cheer their success with chicken legs and Cristal. Black goes to dump the car while the rest retreat to Tommy's [[Jamaica Estates, Queens|Jamaica Estates]] house, where they celebrate and joke around (The movie ''[[Gummo]]'' is playing on the TV), waking Tommy's girlfriend Keisha ([[Taral Hicks]]). Sincere soon leaves and is followed in gesture by the others. He returns to his [[St. Albans, Queens|St. Albans]] home to his girlfriend Tionne ([[Tionne Watkins|Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins]]) and infant daughter Kenya. Meanwhile, Tommy learns of a new form of heroin which he takes as a lucrative business opportunity.  The next day, Tommy meets with Sincere to discuss the venture. His rhetoric is met with resistance from the more intellectually inclined Sincere, who has become enlightened to the plight of urban poor and seeks a life free of crime. After Tommy ridicules Sincere for his sentiments and mentions his connection with a Jamaican drug lord "Ox" residing in New York City, Sincere reluctantly agrees. Tommy then visits Ox in his lavish mansion, to plead for Ox's assistance in obtaining the heroin. Ox agrees on the grounds that Tommy repays him via a huge favor at a later date.  In Mark's grandmother's basement, the group convenes to discuss the imminent flux of business. Sin explains via narration that one of Tommy's associates, Knowledge, is to be involved in the operation. Meanwhile, Sincere teases Black, who is upset that his share of the money from the robbery was less than Sincere received. While this is happening, Knowledge tells Tommy over the phone that he had heard that Black had been talking about wanting to rob Sincere. Tommy becomes incredibly enraged. He pushes Black to the floor and forces him to strip naked in front of everyone while firing a handgun wildly into the floor. Tommy then orders Black to sit on the couch, as he visibly harbors hostile feelings towards the rest of the men.  The duo, along with some of their friends, including Knowledge and Mark, start transporting drugs from [[Queens, New York|Queens]] to [[Omaha]], and begin to overrun the drug business there. This is met with jealousy from a local drug dealer Big Head Rico ([[Tyrin Turner]]), who informs the police of their activities. This results in a raid at their stash-house, which results in Mark's death and Knowledge's arrest. Knowledge calls Tommy's house from jail and is told by Keisha that Tommy isn't there, nor should he have called since the [[FBI]] could have tapped their phone. Knowledge gets angry that Tommy won't come to bail him out, and calls Shameek, aka Father Sha ([[Method Man]]), to not only infiltrate Rico's gang, but to handle Tommy. While at a strip club in [[Omaha]], Shameek confronts Rico and informs him that Knowledge sent him here to kill him and his associates. When Rico tries to run from Shameek, Shameek shoots and kills Rico as well as some members of his crew. While reloading, Shameek is shot by the bartender. Stumbling out the club, he manages to evade police.  Meanwhile, Tommy goes to Jamaica with Ox, and repays him by killing Sosa, the son of a local drug lord. Back at Tommy's house, Keisha is arrested by police and later bailed out by Tionne. Tommy finds out about the raid and leaves town. Later, when Sosa's family and friends find out that it was Ox who ordered the hit, Pelpa, the gang's leader and close friend of Sosa, sends a hit squad to kill him in his home. Ox is able to kill most of them before he himself is finally killed by a female assassin named Chiquita.  While these events occur, Sincere prepares to leave the drug game and move his girlfriend and child to Africa, despite Tommy's jokes that he was getting soft for wanting to leave. They make plans to leave on New Years Day, 2000. However, Sincere is now suspicious of Tommy since the Omaha incident. Tommy, meanwhile, has been laying low in Atlanta, selling marijuana with Wise and LaKid, two younger men from New York. One night at dinner, Tommy instigates an argument between Wise and LaKid, in which ends with both men to drawing their guns and LaKid shooting Wise dead. Tommy, extremely intoxicated, remains seated, calmly glancing at Wise's dead body as the police arrive to arrest him and is, inexplicably, later released. It is later revealed that Tommy was chosen by federal agents to [[assassinate]] a black Muslim leader, Rev. Saviour, (Dr. [[Benjamin Chavis]]) who plans to preach against the government on New Year's Eve.  Tionne comes home from shopping to find Shameek and a few other men waiting for her inside and is confronted concerning the whereabouts of Sincere and Tommy. After a tense standoff with pistols, the men leave. Later while talking to a friend ([[AZ (rapper)|AZ]]) outside a barbershop, Black (who had sworn that he'd get revenge after the basement incident) and an accomplice confront Sincere and shoots him in the leg, causing Sincere to shoot back in self-defense, killing Black and his accomplice, before fleeing the scene.  On [[New Years' Eve]] 1999, Tommy confronts Rev. Saviour in his study before he was to make a massive speech of hope and points his gun at him. Saviour convinces Tommy not to go through with his mission, even though this will be seen as an act of betrayal by the feds and will put his life at risk. Tommy, in tears, agrees, and the two men embrace.  Shameek visits Keisha's home, in the hopes of finding Tommy there. He physically assaults Keisha, and after a struggle, Keisha gets hold of Shameek's gun, and shoots him in the face at point-blank range.  Sincere, now in Africa with Tionne and their child, reflects on recent events, relieved and happy to start a new life.

Belle's Magical World
 ===The Perfect Word=== Beast ([[Robby Benson]]) and Belle ([[Paige O'Hara]]) plan to eat together, and Beast asks for advice from Lumiere ([[Jerry Orbach]]). While Cogsworth ([[David Ogden Stiers]]) escorts Belle to the dining room, they come across the castle's well-meaning but rather verbose scribe, Webster ([[Jim Cummings]]), turned into a dictionary, whom Belle invites to join them in the dining room (to Cogsworth's dismay).  During the meal, while Belle explains a story she has been reading to Beast, Beast gets sweaty. He demands for the windows to be opened, despite there being a draft of air in the room and the servants getting cold. Beast and Belle get into an argument, and Beast strikes Webster off the table when the dictionary begins giving unwanted [[synonym]]s to Belle's insults. Subsequently, they both stop speaking to each other, despite Lumiere and Cogsworth's attempts to patch things up. Eventually, Webster, feeling guilty for his part, forges a letter of apology from Beast to Belle with his friends, a pile of papers named Crane ([[Jeff Bennett]]) and a quill named LePlume ([[Rob Paulsen]]). Belle sees the letter, and makes amends with Beast.  That night, however, the truth comes out, and after a furious chase around the castle, Beast catches and banishes Webster, Crane and LePlume for the forgery, throwing them into the forest. Belle ventures out and brings them back, and Beast, touched by Belle's sympathy, forgives the three and allows them back in, realizing that their intentions were good. The moral of the story being that it is easy to forgive.  ===Fifi's Folly=== On the anniversary of Lumiere's first date with Fifi ([[Kimmy Robertson]]), Lumiere grows so nervous to the point that he cleans himself excessively and turns to Belle for advice, by walking with her in the garden and reciting what he plans to say to Fifi to her. Fifi overhears this, and believes that Lumiere and Belle are having an affair behind her back. In reality, Lumiere has planned a surprise snow ride around the castle gardens with Fifi. To get back at Lumiere, Fifi attempts to make Cogsworth like her, who is apparently not interested.  In the end, things are cleared up and Lumiere and Fifi go for the ride, but the pot they are sitting in slips off the edge of the balcony and hangs over the moat (the same chasm in which [[Gaston (Disney)|Gaston]] will eventually meet his doom). Lumiere holds onto Fifi while hanging for dear life, and tells her that he loves her. Before they can fall, Belle, Cogsworth and a few more servants arrive and get them back to safety. Everyone ends up learning to not jump to conclusions and that sometimes things are just as they seem.  ===Mrs. Potts' Party=== Mrs. Potts is feeling depressed due to dreadful weather, and Belle decides to cheer her up by throwing a surprise party for her. Belle has come to look at Mrs. Potts as a mother figure by this point. During preparations for the party, Belle and her friends have to avoid waking up the sleeping Beast. Beast spent the entire previous night fixing a leak in the roof and needs his sleep. However, Lumiere and Cogsworth's rivalry gets in the way. The two argue and compete over the tasks of composing music, choosing Mrs. Pott's favorite flowers, and choosing the flavors of the cake that will be served at the party. Two oven mits, Chaud (the red mit) and Tres (the blue mit), also take part in the argument, as they each side with one of the rivals.  Eventually, Lumiere and Cogsworth's attempt to sabotage one another's decisions has consequences. The baking cake explodes and makes a complete mess in the kitchen. Lumiere and Cogsworth, after a scolding from Belle, decide to put their rivalry behind them for good and work together to make a small surprise for Mrs. Potts. The plan goes well, and Mrs. Potts is cured of her depression, and the sun finally shines again. Everyone learns the power of cooperation and compromises.  ===The Broken Wing=== Belle and Beast arrange to have lunch together again, but an injured bird accidentally flies into Belle's room, and she forgets her arrangement, instead paying more attention to the bird. Beast discovers this, and flies into a rage, as he has a strong dislike for birds, trying to catch the bird, but he trips over Cogsworth and hits his head hard on the floor. This strips him of his hatred for birds, but his selfishness remains, driving him to lock the bird in a cage and demand that he sing for him when he pleases, but the obviously saddened and frightened bird refuses.  Meanwhile, Cogsworth feels he is losing control over his staff, and demands their respect with harsh treatment. In the meantime, Belle convinces Beast to release the bird once its wing is cured. But the bird, still too weak, begins to fall, and Beast rushes to rescue it. In the process, Cogsworth falls from the West Wing balcony and into the garden. He is unhurt, and learns that you cannot demand respect, but you can earn it by giving it. Belle and Beast make amends, and Beast learns to treat people and animals with respect and compassion.

 In 1991 [[Los Angeles]], slacker Jeff "the Dude" Lebowski is assaulted in his home by two hired goons who demand money that the wife of a Jeffrey Lebowski owes to a porn magnate and loan shark named Jackie Treehorn. The two soon realize they have attacked the wrong Jeffrey Lebowski and leave but not before one of them urinates on the Dude's rug.  The next day, the Dude explains this incident to his two friends and [[bowling]] partners: timid Donny and temperamental [[Vietnam veteran]] Walter Sobchak. Encouraged by Walter, the Dude pays a visit to the other Jeffrey Lebowski, the eponymous "Big Lebowski", a cantankerous elderly wheelchair-bound millionaire, to seek compensation for his ruined rug. Although his request is promptly refused, the Dude craftily steals one of Lebowski's expensive rugs by telling Brandt, Lebowski's [[sycophant]]ic assistant, that his boss told him to take any rug in the house. The Dude subsequently meets Bunny, Lebowski's young [[trophy wife]].  Days later, Lebowski contacts the Dude stating that Bunny has been kidnapped. He wants the Dude to deliver a briefcase containing the million-dollar ransom and see if he can recognize the culprits. Later, a different pair of thugs appear in the Dude's apartment, knock him unconscious and take Lebowski's rug. When Bunny's kidnappers call to arrange delivery of the ransom, Walter instead gives the kidnappers a fake ransom, namely, a briefcase filled with dirty underwear. The kidnappers grab the fake ransom and leave. Later that night, the Dude's car is stolen with the actual ransom money briefcase still inside.  Jeffrey Lebowski's adult daughter Maude contacts the Dude and reveals that she took the rug, explaining that Bunny is one of Jackie Treehorn's porn stars. She reasons that Bunny 'kidnapped' herself and asks the Dude to recover the ransom which her father illegally withdrew from the family's [[foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]]. Lebowski is angry that the Dude failed to deliver the ransom money and shows him a severed green-painted toe, allegedly belonging to Bunny and delivered by the kidnappers. Later, a gang of German nihilists invade the Dude's apartment and threaten him, identifying themselves as the kidnappers. Maude says the German nihilists are actually Bunny's friends.  The Dude's car is found by the police without the ransom money, and he reclaims it. Later, while cruising around in the car, the Dude finds the homework assignment of a high school student named Larry inside. Assuming that Larry was the one who stole the car, Walter and the Dude go to his house, believing Larry has also stolen the money. When Larry refuses to respond to Walter and the Dude's threats, Walter wrecks a new sports car parked outside which they assume Larry bought with the money. However, a neighbor rushes outside, reveals himself as having just bought the car and angrily wrecks the Dude's car in revenge, thinking it to be Walter's.  The Dude is then forcibly brought before Treehorn, who asks the whereabouts of Bunny and says he wants the money she owes him. He drugs the Dude's [[White Russian (cocktail)|White Russian]] cocktail, causing the Dude to have a dream sequence involving Maude and bowling. The Dude awakens in police custody, where he is verbally and physically assaulted by the [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] police chief. During the cab ride home, the Dude gets thrown out after he asks the cab driver to change the radio station playing an Eagles song. A red sports car zooms past and the viewer sees that Bunny is driving with all her toes intact.  The Dude then finds his bungalow completely trashed and is greeted by Maude, who seduces him. He figures that Treehorn drugged him so that his goons could look for the ransom money at the Dude's home. After Maude has sex with him, she says she hopes to conceive a child. The Dude protests being a father but Maude tells him that he will not be involved in the child's upbringing. Maude also explains that her father has no money: her mother was the wealthy one and she left her money exclusively to the family charity. Having an epiphany, the Dude and Walter travel to the Lebowski estate, while the Dude explains: when Lebowski, who apparently hated his wife, heard of the kidnapping, he withdrew money from the foundation, kept it for himself and gave the Dude a briefcase without any money in it, lying that it contained a million dollar ransom. The kidnapping was also a ruse: when Bunny took an unannounced trip, her friends (the nihilists) faked a kidnapping to be able to extort money from Lebowski. Walter and the Dude confront the Big Lebowski, who refuses to admit responsibility but is thrown out of his wheelchair by Walter, who believes that he's faking his paralysis.  The affair apparently over, the Dude and his bowling teammates return to the bowling alley. As they leave, they are confronted in the parking lot by the nihilists, who have set the Dude's car on fire. They once again demand the ransom money. Even after the Dude and Walter explain they don't have the money, the nihilists try to rob them anyway. Walter violently beats all three, biting the ear off of one. However, in all the excitement, Donny suffers a fatal heart attack.  Walter and the Dude go to the beach to scatter Donny's ashes. Walter turns an informal eulogy into a tribute to the [[Vietnam War]]. After accidentally covering the Dude with Donny's ashes and after a brief argument, Walter hugs him and says, "Come on, Dude. Fuck it, man. Let's go bowling." At the bowling alley, the story's cowboy narrator tells the viewer that Maude is pregnant with a "little Lebowski" and expresses his hope that the Dude and Walter will win the bowling tournament.  
The Big Hit
 Melvin Smiley is a hitman leading a secret life and maintaining two relationships, one with the demanding and demeaning Chantel, who does not accept his work, and another with Pam, who knows nothing of his job. Melvin is somewhat of a pushover, trying to appease all of Chantel's demands, even her most expensive wishes, as well as rolling over whenever one of his co-workers takes credit for his achievements. Perhaps as a result of his helplessness in asserting himself, throughout the early scenes Melvin is often seen drinking [[Maalox]] to relieve a developing [[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]].  Feeling underpaid for their work for mob boss Paris, the assassin team of Smiley, Cisco, Crunch, Vince and Gump take an independent job, kidnapping Keiko Nishi, the teenage daughter of local electronics magnate Jiro Nishi, for a hefty ransom. Unfortunately, the team does not realize that Nishi has recently gone [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] over his failed foray into films and furthermore, their boss Paris is the girl's godfather. Enlisted by the group to hold Keiko, Melvin has to hide the bound and gagged schoolgirl on his property, attempting to keep her presence hidden from Pam and her parents, who are coming for dinner.  Melvin feels sorry for the girl and relieves her from her bondage. In the ensuing hours they build up a rapport preparing dinner together, an act which leads into a love scene reminiscent of the pottery scene from ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', but which is cut short when Keiko attempts to escape.  Ordered by Paris to discover the kidnappers of his goddaughter, a panicked Cisco kills Gump, but not before coaxing him into also implicating Melvin for the kidnapping.  A team of assassins crash Melvin's dinner with Pam's family, leading to a shootout during which Melvin realizes Pam was going to break up with him under pressure from her stereotypically [[Jew]]ish mother. Melvin and Keiko's feelings for each other lead them to form an awkward romance, and she and Melvin attempt to escape from the fiasco, pursued by Cisco. In the chaos, Melvin happens to run into Chantel and finally takes the opportunity to stand up to her and end their relationship.  A fight ensues between Cisco and Melvin, culminating at a video store where the ever-honest Melvin stops to return an overdue tape. Melvin kills Cisco by stabbing him in the chest, but not before Cisco arms an explosive device. Melvin leaves the building and is confronted by Keiko, her father and Paris. He re-enters the building, which explodes.  Paris and Nishi, believing Melvin to be dead, call off the manhunt. Soon Melvin is revealed to have survived, sheltered from the blast by an enormous solid [[gold]] film stand-up made for the flop that destroyed Nishi's career. Melvin and Keiko are reunited and ride off together, while Nishi recoups his losses by making a film out of the story of his daughter's kidnapping.  
Billy's Balloon
 A stick figure toddler (presumably named Billy) is repeatedly attacked by his red balloon. No explanation for how or why the balloon is doing so is ever given. Similar events are shown to be occurring with other children as the short progresses. The story is considered a parody of French film director [[Albert Lamorisse]]'s 1956 [[short film]] ''[[The Red Balloon|Le ballon rouge]]''.  There have been many interpretations on what themes the short represents, but Hertzfeldt intentionally avoids talking about them, as to not invalidate the personal experiences the audience has with the film.<ref>http://www.bitterfilms.com/articles-c.html</ref>  
Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss
 Billy Collier ([[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean P. Hayes]]) is an aspiring photographer in [[Los Angeles]] who has had little artistic success and much romantic frustration. He comes up with the idea of recreating iconic screen kisses from [[Hollywood]] movies (such as [[Burt Lancaster]] and [[Deborah Kerr]]'s in ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'') using [[drag queen]]s in the female roles. While out for coffee with his roommate Georgiana ([[Meredith Scott Lynn]]), he meets Gabriel ([[Brad Rowe (actor)|Brad Rowe]]), the server. That night at a party, Billy's friend Perry (Richard Ganoung) agrees to finance Billy's Screen Kiss project and Billy [[Serendipity|serendipitously]] runs into Gabriel. Billy recruits him to model and the two develop a friendship (although Gabriel says that he has a girlfriend in [[San Francisco]]).  Billy quickly becomes infatuated with Gabriel, but cannot figure out if Gabriel is really straight; Gabriel does little to help, continually sending ambiguous signals. At Perry's invitation, the two attend an exhibit by photographer Rex Webster, who tries to poach Gabriel as a model (and potential trick). Webster offers to take Gabriel to [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]] for an underwear ad shoot, sparking Billy's jealousy. Back at Gabriel's place, Billy and Gabriel seem to be getting closer but their rapport is interrupted by a phone call from Gabriel's girlfriend Natalie.  Billy shoots his first setup with Gabriel, the Lancaster-Kerr kiss. Following the shoot, Gabriel tells Billy that his relationship with Natalie is over. Billy mentions the [[Kinsey scale]], on which Billy describes himself as a "perfect six," but Gabriel admits he does not know where on the scale he falls. Back at Billy's apartment, they continue to talk and drink and Gabriel asks if he can spend the night on the couch. Billy suggests that Gabriel sleep in his bed (ostensibly because of Gabriel's height), to which Gabriel eventually agrees. When the two are in bed, Billy makes tentative overtures, to which Gabriel seems to respond initially; however, Gabriel suddenly pulls away, after which Billy apologizes and gets up to sleep on the couch.  Gabriel gets the underwear modeling job and goes to Catalina. Billy follows after him to Catalina with Georgiana, who, on the rebound from her boyfriend, Andrew (Christopher Bradley), hooks up with drug-addled island resident "Gundy" ([[Carmine Giovinazzo|Carmine D. Giovinazzo]]). Billy crashes Rex Webster's ([[Paul Bartel]]) underwear shoot looking for Gabriel, but does not find him.  Billy eventually tracks Gabriel down at Rex's party later that night and the two talk on the beach. Billy relates to Gabriel how confused he was when he [[coming out|came out]], saying, "I swore to myself that if I could ever be there for somebody, I would, so that that person wouldn't have to go through all the shit I went through. What I'm trying to say is, if you're having problems figuring out where you stand, even if you're not sure of what you're supposed to want-" Abruptly, however, before Billy can finish, one of Gabriel's fellow male models walks up to them. Billy instantly realizes that the two of them are in some kind of relationship with each other and Gabriel tells Billy straightforwardly, "Billy, I'm pretty sure what I'm supposed to want." Gabriel tries to soften the blow, but Billy rebuffs him. Billy feels hurt and humiliated and even wonders if Gabriel used him to get his modeling career off the ground. Later, Perry tries to console Billy, telling him that a few years earlier Perry had similarly fallen for someone who did not return his affections; Perry confesses that that man was Billy. The next morning, Georgiana has ditched Gundy. Billy and Georgiana then head back home.  The movie ends with the opening of Billy's "Hollywood Screen Kiss" series exhibition in Los Angeles, which includes his photos of Gabriel. The exhibit appears to be very successful and Billy receives many congratulations from various visitors. Perry shows Billy a magazine with an underwear ad featuring Gabriel and suggests that Billy give him a call. Billy demurs, saying he needs some time away. Toward the end of the night, after his friends have gone, Billy meets a handsome young man named Joshua (Robbie Cain) who enthusiastically admires Billy's photographic work. It is suggested that along with his newfound artistic success, Billy may at last find romantic fulfillment as well.  The film is punctuated with Billy's fantasy sequences of himself and Gabriel in pastiches of romantic film scenes, including the aforementioned ''From Here to Eternity'' and the films of [[Fred Astaire]]. Billy carries a [[Instant film|Polaroid]] camera with him everywhere, and his reminiscences are illustrated with Polaroid photographs.  The film in fact opens with such a monologue, with Billy relying on a series of Polaroids while relating how he grew up gay "in a small town in Indiana, where there's plenty of corn, fast cars, and straights. Lots and lots of straights. I mean, ''a lot.''" Billy's opening narrative demonstrates his awareness that he is in a film and breaking the [[fourth wall]].  Several scenes in the movie are backed up by classic songs of bygone times sung by notable and lesser known divas; these are lip-synced by more or less the same troupe of drag queens, a running gag throughout the film.  
Beyond Paradise
 The film is a true tale of Cunningham's years in [[Hawaii]]. He leaves [[Los Angeles]] and moves with his mother to the Big Island and befriends three "locals", Ronnie, Zulu and Keao. At the same time, he is bullied and harassed for being a "[[haole]]" or foreigner.  The three lead characters were inspired by Cunningham's real life high school friends, as seen in the ending credits. The film is dedicated to Donald Boy (Ronnie), Zulu (Zulu), while Keao was a composite of two friends combining the humor of one friend and the drug element of another into one character.  
The Big Swap
 A group of friends meet and plan to swap partners for one night. Every man brings his car key and they all throw it in a bunch of bowl and mix it up. Then the women picks up blindfolded one of the car keys and has to spend a night with whoever's owner of that car key. It's all fun and games at first, but after the party they all begin to regret their choices and the direction of their lives.  
Billy Frankenstein
 ''Billy Frankenstein'' tells the story of a kid named Billy Frank (Jordan Lamoureux), who is related to the distant [[Victor Frankenstein]], along with his artistic mother, Sandy ([[Mary Elizabeth McGlynn|Melissa Williamson]]) and [[workaholic]] father George ([[Daran Norris]]). Meanwhile, a man named Bloodstone ([[Peter Spellos]]) dreams of bringing [[Frankenstein's monster|the Frankenstein monster]] to life, but is now unable to because the Frankenstein castle is up for auction. He invites the Franks to move into the castle in the hopes of using Billy (who is the latest relative to Frankenstein) to bring the monster to life. Also, an unintelligent officer named Constable Frogg (John Maynard) has a family history of other Froggs capturing the Frankenstein monster, and dreams of continuing the legacy. Frogg also constantly receives phone calls from [[prank call]]ers who say "ribbit ribbit". Frogg is hired by a man named Otto von Sloane ([[Vernon Wells (actor)|Vernon Wells]]), and his lady Fraulein (Griffin Drew), to scare the Franks into selling him the castle and make way for a [[Shopping mall|mall]].  Billy, his mother Sandy and Billy's aunt Thelma (Kristin Jadrnicek) arrive at the castle and meet Bloodstone, who introduces himself as the caretaker of the house. Billy discovers one of Dr. Frankenstein's books about life and death and finds a map of the castle inside the book which leads him into the basement where he discovers the inanimate Frankenstein monster. When Billy falls asleep in the basement, the monster comes to life. Rather than being scary and threatening, the monster turns out to be friendly and confused. Billy wakes up later to discover the monster had gotten loose and goes out to find him, as does Bloodstone, who hires Sloane's lawyer (who announced the house repossession) to find Billy and the monster. Frogg disguises himself as a cable guy and sets up microphones around the house. Billy eventually comes across the monster, befriends it and brings the monster, poorly disguised as his grandmother, through a nearby village. Soon though, the monster begins to run out of power and so Billy and Bloodstone take him back to the lab basement to recharge him.  Billy's father, George, finally arrives home much to Billy's excitement. George announces that he got fired from his job, but isn't worried because of his family importance and inheritance to the castle, but Billy and Sandy tell him that the lawyer had told them earlier in the film that they need to raise $25,000 to buy the castle, so George comes up with the idea of inviting Sloane to dinner to discuss the payment. Billy and Bloodstone try bring the monster back to life, but leave when they think they've failed, but the monster shows signs of life when they leave. Billy and Bloodstone try to hide the monster from prying eyes, but Thelma faints after seeing him. Sloane and Fraulein visit Frogg to find he has disguised himself as the monster, which Sloane takes an interest in. While out shopping, George and Sandy buy a Frankenstein monster doll to give to Billy as a present and arrive home to give Billy the doll and have dinner with Sloane and Fraulein. Finally, Sandy sees the monster for herself, who Sloane mistakes for Frogg. When Sloane is convinced of the monster's existence, he and Fraulein both flee.  The film ends with the Franks, Thelma, Bloodstone and Frogg, raising the $25,000 by having tourist attractions in their castle, complete with photos with the Frankenstein monster and tours down to the lab, where a little girl pulls the lever and electrocutes herself, making her resemble the ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]''. When the Franks end up wondering what happened to Sloane's lawyer, we see the lawyer, still looking for Billy and the monster, asking [[Dracula]] where they are, and Dracula points into the direction of [[Transylvania]], which the lawyer follows.  
Black Cat, White Cat
 Matko Destanov, a small-time [[Romani people|Romani]] smuggler and profiteer, lives with his teenage son Zare in a ramshackle house by the [[Danube|Danube River]] in eastern [[Serbia]] near the [[Bulgaria]]n border.  He has plans to acquire a whole train of smuggled fuel, which he finds at cut-price. To obtain a loan that would subsidize the heist, he visits Grga Pitić, a wheelchair-using old gangster, who's an old friend of Zarije Destanov, Matko's father and Zare's grandfather. Matko then plots the details of the job with an ally named Dadan, a rich, fun-living, drug-snorting gangster who has a harem, juggles grenades, and cheats at gambling. However, Dadan double-crosses him and glitches up the deal by giving Matko a drink that is drugged, and carrying out the job while Matko is unconscious, which means that Matko owes Dadan a great deal of cash. Matko cannot afford to pay, so Dadan makes a deal whereby he would forgive the debt, thereby wiping the slate clean, if Zare and Afrodita, Dadan's dwarf sister whom he desperately wants to marry off, get married. However, Zare is in love with Ida, a barmaid who works in an establishment run by her Roma grandmother Sujka, and Afrodita is waiting for the man of her dreams. Dadan coerces Afrodita into marrying by dunking her in a well, while Zare first learns of the scheme to marry him off from Ida, who has overheard Dadan and Matko plotting it in the restaurant where she works. Meanwhile, Zare retrieves Zarije from the hospital where he is being kept, with the aid of a gypsy band. Grga Pitić is having problems of his own, as he wants his grandsons, including six-foot plus giant Grga Veliki, to get married.  The two reluctantly endure the wedding ceremony held at Matko's house, which Dadan refuses to postpone after the sudden apparent death of Zarije. They were not supposed to have a wedding while in mourning, but Dadan decides to delay the death announcement, so Matko and Zare hide Zarije's body in the attic, packed in ice. Zare is dismayed, since he wants to leave the place, and had hoped that the required mourning period for his beloved grandfather would give him the opportunity to get away, and thus avoid being married off against his will. Ida and Sujka provide the catering for the wedding, and Ida is upset at seeing her beloved married off to someone else. By contrast, Dadan is really enjoying himself, whether dancing to gypsy band music, bouncing on the bed with his harem, and juggling grenades. However, the bride runs away mid-ceremony, pursued by Dadan, Matko and Dadan's criminal cronies. Meanwhile, Grga Veliki is driving his father and brother to Matko's house so that they may visit Zarije's grave (Grga Pitić and Zarije are old friends). The fleeing bride then stumbles across Grga Veliki, and he stops the truck when he sees her crossing the road; he is willing to protect her from her villainous brother, and the couple fall instantly in love. Grga Pitić arrives on the scene, after his wheelchair had fallen out the back of the truck and rolled downhill, and he is delighted that Grga Veliki has found his mate. The old gangster forces Dadan, who had once worked for him, to accept the match.  The groom meanwhile conspires with Sujka and Ida to bring Dadan down a peg, and rigs the [[outhouse]] so that the seat will come apart. While the preparations for the wedding ceremony of Afrodita and Grga Veliki are being conducted, Matko and Dadan pass the time by playing dice, with Dadan cheating. Sujka comes in during the game, and serves the unsuspecting Dadan a drink spiked with something that would give him diarrhea. Furthermore, Grga Pitić apparently dies, and Dadan and Matko hide his body in the attic, where Zarije's body is also hidden. However, the two corpses soon both come back to life; they were not dead after all. They are surprised to find themselves together, as they had not seen each other for 25 years and each had thought the other was dead. During the ceremony, Dadan starts to feel uncomfortable and rushes into the outhouse ... and falls into the manure. His harem and cronies desert him, and as he tries to clean himself off on a goose, only Matko remains loyal, and he provides Dadan with a shower from the garden hose. Zare meanwhile grabs the wedding official at gunpoint and orders him to solemnize his marriage with his sweetheart, Ida, and the two sail off together on a riverboat set for [[Bulgaria]] with a fistful of cash stashed in his grandfather's accordion, the blessing of their respective grandparents and, as witnesses, a black cat and a white cat.  
Bio Zombie
 Woody Invincible and Crazy Bee are two young men selling [[Bootleg recording|bootlegged]] DVDs at a small stall in the ''New Trend Plaza'' Mall. They spend most of their days gambling and committing petty crimes. They meet Rolls, an employee at the beauty parlor, then have a run-in with Mr. Kui, the cellphone store owner. Rolls frequents a [[sushi]] bar in the mall, and flirts with the waiter Loi, who is smitten with her.  Elsewhere, black market dealers sell to three government agents a [[bioweapon]] which turns people into zombies. They brought a zombie to demonstrate the substance's effect, but it breaks out and kills two agents. On the way back after picking up their boss' fixed car, Woody hits the surviving agent, who is carrying a sample of a bioweapon contained in a soft drink bottle. Thinking he needs a drink, Woody pours the sample into his mouth. The two bring him back to the mall, and Woody damages the car again. The reanimated agent slips out of the car, dropping his cellphone.  Woody sells the cellphone to Kui, but still doesn't have enough money to fix the car. The two then robs Rolls’ money and ring. A suspicious Rolls asks Woody to find the robbers in return for a free meal. She intends to get him drunk, so he would admit committing the robbery. At the Sushi bar, they get drunk, much to the chargrin of Loi. Woody and Rolls head to the bathroom to have sex. An anxious Loi follows them, but is injured by the zombified agent. He alerts Woody and Rolls, but the zombie is already gone when they check.  Rolls lets Loi rest at the beauty parlor. Loi reanimates and keeps Rolls captive as he still has affection for her. The agent retrieves his cellphone from Kui's shop. Kui accuses Woody and Bee of theft, and Ox, a security guard, calls the police. Two policemen, known only by their badge numbers, #3001 and #9466, question the Kui's, Woody and Bee. Woody and Bee's behaviors makes the officers suspicious, and #9466 eventually handcuffs them in the security guard's office. While #3001 goes around the mall to find witnesses to the theft, he is killed by Loi.  The agent burst into the security office, kills Ox and attacks #9466. The policeman kills the zombie, but dies from his injuries. Bee gets the handcuff key from #9466, and frees himself and Woody. The two heads to the mall entrance, and sees Jelly, Rolls' co-woker, who just got back after a walk. The reanimated Ox remotely closes the mall's shutter, trapping everyone inside. The three then meets the Kui's, who just had a brief run-in with a zombie, and the group hides in the beauty parlor.  Woody heads out alone to call the police. He rescues Rolls while Loi is distracted fighting off the zombies coming for her. They head back to the beauty parlor, and the group decide to escape instead of waiting for rescue.  They board an elevator, but it cannot move due to the weight limit. When a zombie closes in, Kui pushes Jelly out. Disgusted, the rest of the group exits the elevator and goes back for Jelly, but finds her dead. They head to the security office, killing zombies on the way. Mrs. Kui is separated from the group and attacked by zombies. Kui, who is hiding nearby, tries to help, but is killed along with his wife. Bee arrives and, distracted by Mrs. Kui's death, is bitten.  At the security office, Woody, Rolls and Bee cannot find the security key to open the entrance door. After saying his last works, Bee is killed by Ox. Enraged, Woody beheads Ox, then cuts off Bee's head before he reanimates. Woody and Rolls head down the parking garage, now crawling with zombies. Fighting their way through the shambling undead, they reach Woody’s boss’ car. Loi appears, lifts up the garage shutter, then pushes the car out so that the two can escape.  At a gas station, Woody is unable to find a working phone. He sees an emergency broadcast, which warns people against drinking soft drinks. Looking outside, Woody sees Rolls drinking from the bottle which he earlier took from the agent. Woody briefly considers killing Rolls, but instead drinks the rest of the soft drink, and the movie ends.  
Black Dog (film)
 The movie first starts out with [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] agents on a pursuit to stop a truck carrying [[Gunrunning|illegal guns]] as part of an illegal arms operation. The result is the death of the driver, which leads to a disagreement with FBI and ATF agents on involvement with the case.  Jack Crews ([[Patrick Swayze]]) is a truck driver who has just been released from jail for [[vehicular manslaughter]], for accidentally hitting and killing a motorist and his passenger on the side of the road during a trip in which he experienced a [[Black dog (ghost)|Black Dog]] hallucination brought on by exhaustion. Along with his imprisonment, he also lost his [[Commercial driver's license]]. Following his release, he attempts to get back to a normal life, but this time holds a job as a truck mechanic for a local repair shop in [[New Jersey]], unable to drive himself. He is then offered a job by his manager, Cutler ([[Graham Beckel]]) to drive a load of toilets from [[Atlanta]] to [[New Jersey]] for $10,000. Crews initially declines the offer, but then finds out that his house will be repossessed unless he pays off his debt. He then changes his mind and takes the job where he flies down to Atlanta to meet up with Red ([[Meat Loaf]]), who runs the trucking yard.  Red initially gives Crews a brand-new truck to haul the load, but Crews chooses an older [[Peterbilt 379]] in order to not draw too much attention. He is accompanied on the trip by Earl ([[Randy Travis]]) riding shotgun, and Sonny ([[Gabriel Casseus]]) and Wes (Brian Vincent) following in Sonny's [[Chevrolet Camaro]] for policy protection. As they make their way to New Jersey, Crews and the guys experience several run-ins with Red and his crew as they attempt to hijack the load, in retaliation for the failed negotiations with Cutler about money. During the trip, Crews finds out that his load also contains illegal guns (over $3,000,000 worth, according to ATF), and that Wes has been informing Red of their whereabouts throughout the trip. Crews also discovers that Sonny is an [[FBI]] agent when he is shot and killed by Red during another hijack attempt, and that the FBI has been tracking their whereabouts as well. Crews reveals the reason why he lost his license with his sighting of the Black Dog, a herald of destruction for truckers, and how he didn't see the motorist until it was too late.  Things take a turn for the worse when Cutler takes Crews' wife Melanie and daughter Tracy hostage to ensure that Crews will complete the job and finish the entire trip. Despite the numerous attempts from Red to hijack the load, as well as Sonny's death, Crews manages to survive each attempt. When they make it to [[Maryland]], Crews now officially knows what the whole plot is and formulates a plan to turn over the guns to the [[FBI]] and to get his family back. Wes, at this point has gone his separate way, while Earl decides to stay on until the end. Crews puts the FBI tracking device on the truck that Wes is leaving on and eventually the FBI pulls over the truck to realize it is the wrong one. However, Crews calls Agent Allen Ford ([[Charles S. Dutton|Charles Dutton]]) who is leading the case on Wes' cell phone. He tells him his plan which is to meet him at a loading dock in Jersey, where he will be meeting with Cutler to exchange the guns for his family.  Eventually when the meeting occurs, the FBI shows up and a shootout occurs with Cutler's men. Crews is able to catch Cutler before he can escape and then turns him over to the FBI. As a token of gratitude, the FBI gives Crews his commercial driver's license back, and also tells Crews that his house won't be foreclosed, in return for his assistance during the operation and they thank him for bringing Sonny's body back. He is also given the key to drive the truck one last time to the impound lot. Also, Crews thanks Earl, who was wounded in the shootout between the FBI and Cutler's men, for staying, and in return Earl tells Crews to take care of his dog, Tiny (a [[American Pit Bull Terrier|pit bull]] riding in the trailer as a guard), until he heals and everything is sorted out.  As Crews and his family leave the docks for the impound lot, they are intercepted by Red who makes one last attempt at Crews' life, but ultimately their slamming into each other causes Red to lose control of his truck, which then flips over numerous times before getting hit by a train and exploding.  
Birdcage Inn
 Jin-a (Lee Ji-eun), a 22-year-old prostitute, arrives at a small seaside motel called the Birdcage Inn to replace the previous one. The inn is run by a couple who have a daughter and a son. They provide Jin-a with room and board and make a living by renting out rooms and taking a cut of the money she earns. Jin-a works at night and spends her daytime drawing and watching the sea.  In addition to her circumstances Jin-a has a hard time because of the family. The well regarded, silent, apparently caring, father providing for his family rapes Jin-a. The mother only sees Jin-a as a source of money to make a living and to fund the education of her college student daughter and high school student son. The son, Hyun-woo ([[Ahn Jae-mo]]) begs to be allowed to take naked pictures of Jin-a for a photo contest and to have sex with her. At first, Jin-a turns him down. However, after Hyun-woo's long imploration, Jin-a poses for him on the deck of a ship by the seaside and has sex with him. Afterwards he uses his walkman to tap Jin-a's room to listen in on Jin-a and her guests.  The daughter, Hye-mi (Lee Hye-eun), who is sexually repressed, is the same age as Jin-a, does nothing to hide her contempt towards Jin-a.

Blues Brothers 2000
  Elwood Blues is released from prison after serving eighteen years for the events of the [[The Blues Brothers (film)|previous film]]. After waiting a day for his brother, "Joliet" Jake Blues, to pick him up, he is informed that Jake has died (it is never revealed how Jake died, or how he was released before Elwood). He is picked up by Matara, a friend who works for his former drummer [[Willie_Hall_(drummer)|Willie Hall]], who wishes to help him get back on his feet. Before meeting with Willie, Elwood is dropped off to see Sister (now Mother) Mary Stigmata, who is now working at a hospital. She reveals that Curtis has also died, but fathered an illegitimate son Cabel "Cab" Chamberlain, who is an [[Illinois State Police]] commander, and introduces him to an orphan, Buster, to suggest mentoring him. Elwood tracks down Cab and asks him to join [[The Blues Brothers Band]], which he plans to re-form. Elwood always reveals the truth about Cab's birth, which he was unaware of. Cab is offended at the suggestion to join him after seeing Elwood's and Jake's criminal history, and throws him out of the building. Buster steals his wallet, which contains enough money for Elwood to purchase a new [[Bluesmobile]].  While working as a singer at Willie's strip club, Elwood discovers his friend is being shaken down by the Russian mafia. When two of them return, Elwood gets them drunk and dumps them in an alley, bound and gagged with duct tape, with the aid of bartender "Mack" McTeer. The Russians return, and burn the club down, but not before Elwood hears Mack sing. The next day, Elwood, "Mighty" Mack (the new lead singer) and Buster begin tracking down the Blues Brothers Band. [[Matt "Guitar" Murphy]] joins again, at the advice of his wife. Three members work at a radio station, and quickly agree to join. Their lead trumpet, "Mister Fabulous" is now a funeral director; Ellwood disrupts a Russian Orthodox graveside service, thereby incurring more wrath of the Russian Mob but getting their trumpeter back. Finally, [[Murphy Dunne]] joins up, after his boss at a [[634-5789|call center]] grants him permission.  The newly reformed band uses their old agent, Murray Sline, to book them a gig. On the way to the show, they are followed by Cab and the Illinois State Police, who are looking for Elwood for stealing Cab’s wallet; they also believe that he has kidnapped Buster. While avoiding the police, Elwood interrupts a militia group meeting, inadvertently destroying their boatful of explosives.  The Band arrives for their gig at a Kentucky county fair, to learn Murray Sline booked them in as a [[Bluegrass music|Bluegrass Band]]. They perform the show anyway to great acclaim by the crowd. Afterwards, they evade capture by the police, but the cops catch up with them at a [[tent revival]], where old friend Reverend Cleophus James is preaching. Before Cab can arrest them, after hearing the music he has an epiphany that he should join the Band instead of being a police officer. The Band evades capture once more, with the transformed Cab joining them in continuing on to their next gig, a tryout for a [[Battle of the Bands]], put on by Queen Moussette<ref name=BB2000/>, allegedly a 130 year old voodoo witch. Moussette requests that the band play something [[List_of_Caribbean_music_genres|Caribbean]], and when Elwood begins to explain they don’t play that kind of music, she casts a spell on them to play anyway. Moussette accepts the Blues Brothers for the Battle; however, Elwood, Mack, and Cab are transformed into stone statues.  At the show, Queen Moussette reverses the stone statue spell, to allow The Blues Brothers Band to play against The Louisiana Gator Boys, a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] of blues musicians. They lose to the Gator Boys. Afterwards, the show is interrupted by the arrival of the Russian Mafia and the militia group who lost their boat, who are turned into rats by Queen Moussette. The Illinois State Police arrive, but stand down after Cab informs them that he is all right and there by choice. Elwood suggests that the two bands jam together on stage, and uses the performance as cover when Reverend Mother Mary Stigmata arrives to say goodbye to Cab and Mack. Elwood escapes with Buster and the movie ends with the police once again in pursuit of the Blues Brothers in the Bluesmobile.  
Blade (film)
 In 1967, a pregnant woman is attacked by a vampire while giving birth. Doctors are able to save her baby, but the woman dies of infection.   Thirty years later, the child has become the vampire hunter Blade. He raids a [[rave|rave club]] owned by the vampire Deacon Frost. Police take one of the vampires to the hospital, where he feeds on [[hematologist]] Karen Jenson and escapes. Blade takes Karen to a safe house where she is treated by his old friend Abraham Whistler. Whistler explains that he and Blade have been waging a secret war against vampires using weapons based on their elemental weaknesses, such as sunlight and silver. As Karen is now "marked" by the bite of a vampire, both he and Blade tell her to leave the city.   Meanwhile, at a meeting of vampire elders, Frost, the leader of a faction of younger vampires, is rebuked for trying to incite war between vampires and humans. As Frost and his kind were not born as vampires and are therefore not pure-bloods, they are considered socially inferior. In response, Frost has one of the elders executed and strips the others of their authority.  Upon returning to her apartment, Karen is attacked by a policeman, who is a "[[Familiar spirit|familiar]]", a human slave controlled by a vampire. Blade subdues the familiar and uses information from him to locate an archive of vampire history. Later, at the hideout, Blade injects himself with a special serum that prevents him from succumbing to his desire to drink blood, which would ultimately turn him into a vampire. However, the serum is beginning to lose its effectiveness due to overuse.  While experimenting with the anticoagulant [[EDTA#Medicine|EDTA]] as a possible replacement, Karen discovers that it explodes when combined with vampire blood. She manages to synthesize a vaccine that can cure the infected, but learns that it will not work on a human-vampire hybrid like Blade. Frost and his men attack the hideout, infect Whistler, and abduct Karen. When Blade returns, he helps Whistler commit suicide and arms himself with special syringes filled with EDTA.  When Blade attempts to rescue Karen from Frost's penthouse, he is shocked to find his still alive mother, who reveals that she came back that very night and was brought in by Frost, who appears and reveals himself as the vampire who bit her. Blade is then subdued and taken to the Temple of Eternal Night, where Frost plans to perform the summoning ritual for La Magra, the vampire blood god. Blade is drained of his blood, but Karen allows him to drink from her, triggering his vampirism. Frost completes the ritual and obtains the powers of La Magra. Blade confronts Frost after killing all of his minions, including Blade's mother. During their fight, Blade injects Frost with all of the syringes, causing his body to inflate and explode, killing him.  Karen offers to help Blade cure himself, but he asks her to create a new serum instead. In a brief [[epilogue]], Blade confronts a vampire in [[Moscow]].

The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars
 Now being married anew and having moved to [[Albert Einstein House|112 Mercer Street]], which is a house formerly owned by [[Albert Einstein]], Rob and Chris have an infant son named Robbie. At first the appliances all fear that their masters will pay more attention to him but later grow accustomed to him. One night, Toaster awakes to find the hearing aid in the attic receiving a message which appears to be transmitted from space. The next morning, Toaster informs the other appliances and Ratso, the family's pet rat, of the events occurring the previous night, leading to the appliances and Ratso agreeing to carefully watch the junk drawer in case of Hearing Aid suspiciously escaping again. The following night, Hearing Aid escapes from the drawer and to the attic once more. Robbie, awakened by the sound of the transmission, climbs out of his crib and follows Hearing Aid. The appliances awaken, find Robbie going up the stairs and pursue him, leading them to enter the attic just as a beam of light appears. The shocked appliances pursue Hearing Aid, but in spite of this, Robbie is beamed into space. After grilling Hearing Aid and learning that Robbie has accidentally been transported to [[Mars]] in his place, the appliances contact Wittgenstein, an old [[supercomputer]] and friend from their days in college, for advice by connecting a computer to a security camera in the museum that acts like a phone. The appliances, as per a plan by Wittgenstein, create a makeshift spacecraft with the ceiling fan, a laundry basket, the microwave, and microwaveable popcorn as fuel (Calculator is also provided with the required data to be their navigator) and launch themselves into space, leaving only Ratso to prevent two baby monitor intercoms from alerting Rob and Chris. During their flight through space, the appliances meet a pack of sentient [[balloon]]s who have been let go by human hands and now float endlessly through the cosmos.   Eventually, the appliances reach Mars and, upon a rough landing due to Blanky foolishly turning off the microwave, encounter multiple satellites sent from Earth, among them being [[Viking 1]], in addition to a Christmas angel named Tinselina who was sent to Mars with the former. However, soon after their arrival, the appliances and Tinselina are taken hostage by an army of military toasters who escort them to their 'Supreme Commander', a colossal refrigerator. As revealed by Tinselina, the appliances Mars were built on Earth by a corrupted Alpine manufacturer named "Wonderluxe" and designed to fail from the get-go under a scheme of [[planned obsolescence]]. Angered with their design flaws, the Wonderluxe appliances escaped, left to Mars, and built a missile rocket set to destroy the Earth. Furthermore, the Wonderluxe appliances, harboring hatred for humans, have since built a weapon of mass destruction with the intention of destroying Earth in retaliation. Intent on averting the earth's destruction, and with an upcoming election, Toaster decides to challenge the Supreme Commander for his seat, appointing Hearing Aid as his running mate. As Toaster and the Supreme Commander engage in a heated debate, Robbie is able to push a hand out of his bubble and touch the Supreme Commander, who is briefly overcome with warmth.  The election ends with Toaster the victor. They then meet with the defeated Supreme Commander, who allows the appliances to discover what is behind his doors. As they venture into the icy interior of the Supreme Commander, they find the true form of Supreme Commander, who Hearing Aid recognizes as his long lost brother, who he has not seen in sixty years. Hearing Aid's brother then reveals that he also originally belonged to Albert Einstein, who left him in the wake of World War II, during which he fell into the hands of a Nazi leader, whose ideals influenced him, leading him to become disillusioned with mankind and to escape to Mars, where he assumed an alternate identity to rule through fear. Only after experiencing "the touch of the small boy's hand", combined with Toaster's convicted campaign, did he realize that not all humans are bad. With the conflict resolved, the appliances and Robbie, now joined by Tinselina and Hearing Aid's reformed brother, are about to return to Earth while the Wonderluxe appliances stay behind to wait for the next generation of humans to arrive in the future. After clearing the ground on their spacecraft, Hearing Aid's brother realizes that he forgot to deactivate the missile. Risking being left behind on Mars, Toaster and the ex-Commander jump out of the spacecraft, race to the missile's control panel and successfully abort its launch. The others turn back to rescue Toaster and the commander, and after the two are back on board, Tinselina gives up her clothes and hair so the spacecraft can be provided with organic fuel necessary to return to Earth. The appliances happily ride back to Earth and manage to return Robbie to his room as well as returning themselves to their original posts by sunrise. Tinselina, now stripped of her beauty and deemed 'worthless' by herself, throws herself into a trash can.  Later, on Christmas morning as Robbie is unwrapping his presents, Rob and Chris hear him speak his (second) first word: "toaster". Then, they watch as Robbie gathers Toaster, Blanky, Lampy, Kirby, and Radio around the Christmas tree. As the gang celebrates, Toaster turns on the lights on the tree, on top of which is Tinselina, who was previously rediscovered and restored by Rob and Chris. Meanwhile, Ratso and the other appliances celebrate Christmas in their own ways.

A Bug's Life
  Ant Island is a colony of ants led by the Queen and her daughter, Princess Atta. Every season, they are forced to give food to a gang of marauding grasshoppers led by Hopper. One day, when Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, inadvertently knocks the offering into a stream with his latest invention, a grain harvesting device, Hopper demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik suggests in earnest that they seek help from other stronger bugs, the other ants see it as an opportunity to remove him and send him off.  At the "bug city", which is a heap of trash under a trailer, Flik mistakes a troupe of Circus Bugs (who were recently dismissed by their greedy ringmaster, P.T. Flea) for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent, and accept his offer to travel with him back to Ant Island. During a welcome ceremony upon their arrival, the Circus Bugs and Flik both discover their mutual misunderstandings. The Circus Bugs attempt to leave, but are attacked by a bird; while fleeing, they save Dot, Atta's younger sister, gaining the ants' respect in the process. At Flik's request, they continue the ruse of being "warriors", so the troupe can continue to enjoy the hospitality of the ants. Hearing that Hopper fears birds inspires Flik to create a false bird to scare away the grasshoppers. Meanwhile, Hopper tells his gang how greatly the ants outnumber them and worries that they will eventually rebel against them.  The ants finish constructing the fake bird, but during a celebration, P.T. Flea arrives, searching for his troupe, and he inadvertently reveals their secret. Outraged by Flik's deception, Atta exiles him, and the other ants desperately gather food for a new offering to the grasshoppers. However, when Hopper returns to discover the mediocre offering, he takes over the island, and demands the ants' winter food supply, planning to assassinate the Queen afterwards. Overhearing the plan, Dot informs Flik and the Circus Bugs, convincing them to return to Ant Island.  After rescuing the Queen, Flik deploys the bird; it initially fools the grasshoppers, but P.T. Flea, also mistaking it for a real bird, burns it, exposing it as a decoy. Hopper beats Flik in retaliation, saying that the ants are humble and lowly life forms who live to serve the grasshoppers. However, Flik responds that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of, inspiring the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers. The ants attempt to force Hopper out of Ant Island using P.T. Flea’s circus cannon, but it suddenly begins to rain. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper frees himself from the cannon, and abducts Flik. After the Circus Bugs fail to catch them, Atta rescues Flik. As Hopper pursues them, Flik lures him to the nest of the bird he, Dot, and the Circus Bugs encountered earlier. Thinking that the bird is another decoy, Hopper taunts it before discovering it is real, and is captured and fed to its chicks.  With their enemies gone, Flik has improved his inventions along with the quality of life for Ant Island, Atta professes her love for Flik, and they give Hopper's younger brother Molt, and a few ants to P.T. Flea as new members of his troupe. Atta and Dot respectively become the new queen and princess. The ants congratulate Flik as a hero, and bid a fond farewell to the circus troupe, who promise to return in the future.

Bride of Chucky
 One month after the events of ''[[Child's Play 3]]'', Tiffany ([[Jennifer Tilly]]), a former girlfriend and accomplice of [[serial killer]] Charles Lee Ray ([[Brad Dourif]]), acquires Chucky's remains from a police compound after bribing and murdering a police officer who removed the doll's remains from an evidence locker. Believing that Ray's soul still inhabits the doll, Tiffany crudely stitches Chucky back together and reenacts the voodoo ritual which had instilled Ray's soul inside the doll ten years ago.  Though her incantations fail at first, Chucky unexpectedly comes alive and kills Tiffany's [[Goth subculture|Goth]] admirer Damien ([[Alexis Arquette]]) as Tiffany looks on with excitement. Hoping to pick up where she and Ray left off, Tiffany presents Chucky with a diamond ring which he left for her the night he was killed. Upon realizing that Tiffany believed the gift to be an engagement ring, Chucky explains that he stole it from one of his wealthier victims when he was a notorious human serial killer. Chucky and Tiffany have an argument because Tiffany thought Chucky wished to marry her. Upon learning he had no intention of doing so, a heartbroken Tiffany punishes Chucky by locking him in a playpen. Later, she gives him a doll in a wedding dress to mock him. While Tiffany is taking a bath, Chucky escapes the playpen and pushes the television set into the bathtub, electrocuting her. He then uses the same voodoo ritual to transfer Tiffany's soul into the bride doll in order for her to feel what he went through as a living doll.   Still intent on becoming human again, Chucky reveals his plan to Tiffany that they must retrieve a magical amulet that was buried with Ray's body in order to transfer their souls into the bodies of Tiffany's neighbor Jesse ([[Nick Stabile]]) and his girlfriend Jade ([[Katherine Heigl]]). Tiffany sends Jesse a message asking him to take the two dolls to [[Hackensack, New Jersey]], in exchange for money. Eager to elope with Jade and having been foiled in the past by her strict and overprotective uncle police chief Warren ([[John Ritter]]), Jesse accepts the offer. Jesse proposes to Jade and convinces her to go with him, but as they pack up, Warren plants a bag of [[marijuana]] in Jesse's van to frame him. To stop him sabotaging their plan, Chucky and Tiffany set up a car airbag to launch nails into his face and hide his body. Jesse and Jade return and begin their trip.  Outside a convenience store, they are pulled over by Officer Norton, who searches Jesse's car and finds the marijuana. As he goes back to his patrol car to report it, Chucky causes the car to explode, killing Norton in the process. Witnessing the explosion, Jesse and Jade flee the scene. They both begin to suspect that one of them might have caused the incident and begin to trust each other less, much to the amusement of Chucky and Tiffany. Despite their trust issues, Jesse and Jade stop at a [[wedding chapel]]/hotel and get married. Meanwhile, as Chucky and Tiffany are talking, they discover that Warren is still alive. Warren tries to escape, but he is killed by Chucky. While Jesse and Jade are at the hotel, a con artist couple steals Jesse's money. As the criminals make love in their room, Tiffany throws a bottle at the mirrored ceiling, killing the two con artists with falling shards of glass. Astonished, Chucky instantly proposes to Tiffany, consummating their marriage.  The next morning, a hotel maid finds the corpses of the couple, and Jesse and Jade drive away with their friend and confidante David (Gordon Michael Woolvett), who knew about their plan to elope and about the recent murders brought upon by the dolls. David reveals that Jesse and Jade are the main suspects for all of the deaths and concludes that they are both wrong. Upon realizing their misunderstanding, Jesse and Jade resolve their differences. Just as Jesse and Jade realize that they are innocent, David finds Warren's body in the trunk and confronts them. The dolls then come alive and hold them hostage with guns, ordering them to keep driving. David alerts a police officer and is instantly killed by an oncoming truck. Horrified, Jesse and Jade drive away with the dolls.  Chucky and Tiffany reveal their plan to Jesse and Jade. They then direct Jesse to steal a mobile home to use as a new vehicle to evade the police. Tiffany prepares Jade for the body-switch, and cooks Swedish meatballs and cookies for Chucky, who comments to Jesse that he loves his married life. Through the driving mirror, Jesse notices a large stack of dishes by the sink and gets an idea; remembering what Tiffany said to him about when a woman cooks for a man he should do the dishes in gratitude. He comments to Chucky about Tiffany's lack of tidiness. Jade continues the ruse by commenting to Tiffany that Chucky is being ungrateful for her hard work and should help her.   Soon a fight between Tiffany and Chucky ensues. Jade locks Tiffany into an oven, while Jesse pushes Chucky out the window. Chucky shoots at Jesse, causing the mobile home to run off the road and into a ditch. Chucky forces Jade at gunpoint to take him to his grave site, while Jesse takes Tiffany and follows them. Chucky orders Jade to open the casket and take the amulet, which she does. Jesse then appears with Tiffany and they trade hostages, but Chucky throws a knife into Jesse's back, and ties up the couple for the ritual.  As Chucky begins the incantation, Tiffany kisses him as a distraction and stabs him in the back with his  own knife, saying the two "belong dead". Chucky ends the fight when a shovel fight, and Tiffany is stabbed in the heart and collapses. Jesse then knocks Chucky into his own grave with a shovel. A private investigator ([[Lawrence Dane]]) arrives and witnesses the scene. Jade grabs the investigator's gun and shoots Chucky several times in the chest, killing him. After contacting the police, the investigator tells Jesse and Jade that Chucky is responsible for the murders and sends the couple on their way home.    As the investigator inspects Tiffany, she gives birth to a baby doll before finally dying. The baby doll then attacks the investigator and the scene cuts to black.  
Bulworth
 In March 1996, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United State Senate|U.S. Senator]] Jay Bulworth of [[California]] is losing his bid for re-election to a fiery young populist. Bulworth's [[Socialism|socialist]] views, formed in the 1960s and 1970s, have lost favor with voters, so he has conceded to more [[Conservatism|conservative]] politics and to accepting donations from big corporations. In addition, though he and his wife have been having affairs with each other's knowledge for years, they must still present a happy façade in the interest of maintaining a good public image.  Tired of politics, unhappy with his life in general, and planning to commit suicide, Bulworth negotiates a $10 million [[life insurance]] policy with his daughter as the beneficiary in exchange for a favorable vote from the insurance industry. Knowing that a suicide will void his daughter's inheritance, he contracts to have himself assassinated within two days.  Turning up in California for his campaign extremely drunk, Bulworth freely begins speaking his mind at public events and in the presence of the [[C-SPAN]] film crew following his campaign. After dancing all night in an underground club and smoking [[marijuana]], he even starts rapping in public. His frank, potentially offensive remarks make him an instant media darling and re-energize his campaign. Along the way he becomes romantically involved with a young black activist named Nina, who tags along with him on his campaign stops. He is pursued by the paparazzi, his insurance company, his campaign managers and an increasingly adoring public, all the while fearful of his impending assassination.  After a televised debate during which Bulworth drinks from a flask on air and derides insurance companies and the American healthcare system, he decides to hide at Nina's family's home, located in the [[South Central Los Angeles]] ghetto. While there he wanders around the neighborhood, where he witnesses a group of kids selling [[Crack cocaine|crack]], and buys the group ice cream. After saving the group from a racially motivated encounter with a police officer, he finds out they are "soldiers" of L.D., a local drug kingpin to whom Nina's brother owes money. Bulworth eventually makes it to a television appearance arranged earlier by his campaign manager, during which he raps and repeats verbatim statements Nina and L.D. have told him about the lives of poor black people and their opinions of various American institutions, like education and employment. Eventually he offers the solution that "everybody should fuck everybody" until everyone is "all the same color" stunning the audience and his interviewer.  After Bulworth's TV appearance (at the end of which one mysterious assassination attempt occurs) he escapes with Nina and goes with her back to her house where she reveals that she is the assassin he indirectly hired (ostensibly to make the money needed to pay off the debt her brother owes to L.D.) and will now not carry out the job. Relieved, Bulworth falls asleep for the first time in days in Nina's arms. Bulworth sleeps deeply for over 36 hours (with Nina tenderly watching over him), during which time the media is abuzz about his mysterious absence on election day. During this time, various people are shown reacting to the TV coverage and the impact Bulworth's escapade is making on the political/social conversation in the country (race, poverty, inequity, greed). Bulworth wins the primary election by a landslide.  The next morning the press and Bulworth's campaign managers converge on Nina's house, all eager to talk to him. L.D. also comes to Nina's house and, having had a change of heart, says he will let Nina's brother work off his debt instead of hurting or killing him. Bulworth emerges from the bedroom looking rested and, as he steps outside, he invites Nina to go with him; she eventually joins him, after some hesitation. Bulworth and Nina embrace and begin to kiss as people cheer. As Bulworth happily accepts a new campaign for the presidency, he is suddenly shot in front of the crowd of reporters and supporters by an agent of the insurance company lobbyists, who were fearful of Bulworth's recent push for [[single-payer health care]].  Bulworth's fate is left ambiguous. The final scene shows an elderly vagrant, whom Bulworth met previously, standing alone outside a hospital.  He exhorts Bulworth, who is presumably inside, to not be "a ghost" but "a spirit" which, as he had mentioned earlier, can only happen if you have "a song". In the final shot of the film, he asks the same of the audience.  
Buzz (film)
 The film is based on a real event in 1994, in which two 14-year-olds—Arbel Aloni and Moshe "Moshiko" Ben-Ivgi—murdered a taxi driver (named Derek Roth). In the film, their names have been changed to Ido Ben Ze'ev and Rafi, respectively. Ido comes from a wealthy family and acts as leader, while Rafi lives with his single mother and follows Ido.  The children start committing crimes such as vandalism and theft, with the knowledge of Ofer Reinitz, a police officer, and the school councilor, Naomi. They work together to put the children in juvenile jail, although Ido's father Gidi, who is a prominent lawyer and personal friend of Ofer's from the army, does not believe the accusations against his son and stops the children from being persecuted on several occasions. After they murder a taxi driver for thrills with an old revolver, both Ido and Rafi are arrested.  
Bunny (1998 film)
 Bunny, an elderly female rabbit, lives alone in a small cabin in the forest. While baking a cake one night, she is continually bothered by a large [[moth]] that keeps flying around her kitchen. No matter what she does, she cannot get rid of the intruder; she is especially annoyed when it runs into a photograph, taken many years ago, of herself and her late husband on their wedding day. Eventually she knocks it into the cake batter, which she quickly pours into a pan and shoves into the oven. She then sets the kitchen timer and falls asleep, only to be awakened by loud rumblings and blue-white light coming from the oven, whose door soon falls open. Crawling inside, she finds herself confronted by the moth and begins to float through an otherworldly space toward the source of the light, with a pair of giant moth wings sprouting from her back to propel her as the insect leads her along. She is soon revealed to be among dozens of moths being drawn to the light. The film ends with a close-up of the wedding photo, which comes to life as the younger Bunny nestles her head contentedly on her husband's shoulder; the shadows and reflections of two moths play across the image as well.  During his introduction to the film on the ''Ice Age'' DVD, Wedge offers his interpretation of these events. Bunny dies in her sleep, and the oven serves as a gateway to the afterlife. Her spirit is instinctively drawn into it, as a moth going toward a bright light, and reunited with that of her husband.

Campfire Tales (1997 film)
 In the 1950s, Jenny and Eddie are kissing in a car at a viewpoint. Jenny becomes nervous that someone is watching them after they hear a radio broadcast of a madman on the loose in the area. She forces Eddie to drive them back to town, thinking she sees someone lurking in the woods. They arrive at a [[drive-in]], and Eddie walks to the window to order a milkshake. When he returns toward the car, he sees a [[The Hook|hook hanging from the car's passenger door]].  In the present day, Cliff, his girlfriend Lauren, and her little brother Eric and friend Alex are driving home from a concert. Cliff, drunk and driving erratically, crashes the car in the woods. They light flares and discover an abandoned church foundation nearby, where they start a fire. To pass the time, they begin telling a series of campfire tales.  In the first story, Rick and Valerie are on their honeymoon driving through [[Nevada]]. They take a detour to visit caverns, and park their RV in a rural area. They are disturbed by a local man who warns them not to spend the night there, insisting they park elsewhere. They ignore him. As they have [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] in the RV, a creature watches through the window. Rick leaves to walk to a gas station nearby, and Valerie is attacked through the sunroof of the RV and terrorized by it before passing out. She awakens to a police officer knocking on the door of the RV. As she exits the RV, she hears a screeching noise; she looks back, and sees Rick's eviscerated corpse hanging upside down from a tree, his wedding ring scratching across the metal rooftop.  In the second story, twelve-year-old Amanda is in an online [[chat room]] talking to a girl named Jessica, who is actually an [[online predator]] posing as a young girl. One night, her parents go out and rely on her teenage sister Katherine to stay with her. Katherine leaves to go meet her boyfriend, leaving Amanda alone.  Later on while searching the garage to find her dog the lights go out, and she becomes anxious and feels as though there is someone else in her house. After finding out that her sister Katherine has just returned home, Amanda heads back to her room. Seeing what looks like her dog under the bed, she lies down and  puts her hand down to allow it to be licked by the dog. While looking in the mirror Amanda sees the phrase "People can lick too" and the man licking her hand. She runs to Katherine's room telling her to call 911. Katherine enters Amanda's room, finds the corpse of the family dog underneath Amanda's bed, and the window open.  In the third story, Scott is riding his motorcycle through the country. He notices a rural farmhouse and seeks shelter there during a rainstorm. Inside is a beautiful [[muteness|mute]] woman named Heather; she communicates with Scott by writing on a handheld chalkboard, and invites him to stay the night. During the night, they are disturbed when her father, a rancher, arrives. Scott hears a commotion downstairs, and runs to the kitchen, where he sees two bloodied bodies, and witnesses Heather's father throwing a woman's severed head into the well outside. He finds Heather unharmed, and she insists they leave the house. On the chalkboard, she writes that there are ghosts there. Suddenly, they are confronted by her father, who attacks Scott with an axe. They flee from the house, and as they leave, he passes by Heather's father, who walks toward the front door and enters the house, as if in a [[time loop]]. Scott and Heather ride away on his motorcycle, and spend the night under a willow tree. In the morning, he removes the locket from her neck and opens it; inside are a photo of him and her, dressed in old-fashioned clothing. As Heather awakens, a wound appears across her neck, and her head falls into his lap.  After each of the friends have told a story, Cliff decides to return to the road to see if anyone has stopped at the site of their car accident. Suddenly, Lauren, Eric, and Alex vanish, and their campfire has disappeared from the church. When Cliff returns to the road, he sees himself near the wreckage of his car and an RV, surrounded by paramedics who are attempting to revive him. Lauren, Eric, and Alex are lying dead on stretchers. The RV drivers are Rick and Valerie from the first story; Scott, from the third, is a paramedic attempting to revive Cliff. The attempts to resuscitate him fail, and Cliff dies. Later on, as the paramedics clean up, a car approaches the scene of the accident, with a hook emerging from the open window.  
The Butterfly Dance
 A freaky gardener. A scared young woman. A ghost. Things get a little strange as their small suburban lives go bump in the night.<ref name="RIIFF"/>  
Can't Hardly Wait
 The senior class of a suburban high school, Huntington Hillside, are attending a [[graduation]] party at a large house owned by a rich class member's family. Among them are Preston Meyers ([[Ethan Embry]]), who plans to proclaim his love to his four-year secret [[limerence|crush]] Amanda Beckett ([[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]). Amanda, the most popular girl in school and the senior class prom queen, has recently broken up with her popular [[jock (subculture)|jock]] boyfriend Mike Dexter ([[Peter Facinelli]]). Mike is targeted by [[nerd]] classmate William Lichter ([[Charlie Korsmo]]), who is plotting revenge against him for years of [[bullying]]. Preston's antisocial best friend Denise Fleming ([[Lauren Ambrose]]) has no intention of going to the party but is dragged along by Preston. Kenny Fisher ([[Seth Green]]) is a [[wigger]] who plans on losing his [[virginity]] by the end of the night.  Amanda is consoled by her popular girlfriends, whom she realizes she has nothing in common with, and her own second-cousin, who tries to hit on her. She tries to figure out if she has an identity beyond "Mike Dexter's girlfriend". She discovers a letter addressed to her by Preston and, moved by its contents, makes it her mission to find him, but she doesn't know what he looks like and no one she asks gives any helpful descriptions. Meanwhile, Denise and Kenny end up getting locked inside a bathroom, where they talk about their old friendship and how they had drifted apart; their conversation leads to the restoration of their friendship and escalates into them having [[Sexual intercourse|sex]].  Before the party, Mike convinces his fellow jock friends to dump their girlfriends and remain single as they go to college. Later, an intoxicated Mike learns from Trip McNeely ([[Jerry O'Connell]] in a cameo)—a graduate and former stud from his high school—that in college, guys like them are "a dime a dozen".  Trip emphasizes how he dumped his girlfriend in the same fashion that Mike did to score with women and was unsuccessful. Terrified, Mike tries to get Amanda back, but she is happier without him and humiliates him in front of everyone at the party. Preston finds Amanda and confesses his love, but she assumes he is another pervert and rejects him in front of the entire class. She later realizes her mistake when she sees Preston's yearbook picture and tries to find him, but he has driven home.  At the same time, William devises his plan to get revenge on Mike. He has two ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]''-obsessed friends wait on the roof, while he goes into the party to drive Mike out. While inside the party, William begins drinking [[alcohol]] to fit in, and drinks enough to make him forget what he is doing there. An impromptu sing-along to [[Guns N' Roses]]' "[[Paradise City]]" causes him to become popular. William begins talking with Mike, who apologizes for bullying him. William forgives him, and the two seemingly become friends. When Mike and William are jailed as a result of a police bust, Mike takes the blame.  The next morning, when William sees Mike and some of his friends at a diner, he tries to thank Mike for taking the fall. But Mike acts as though he remembers nothing that happened the previous night and ridicules William in front of his friends. Meanwhile, Preston is at a [[railway station]], about to leave for Boston. Amanda visits Preston at the station and asks him about the letter. Preston confesses he wrote it and is about to depart for a writing workshop with [[Kurt Vonnegut]]. The two say goodbye, but soon, Preston stops and runs back to Amanda, and they kiss.  As the film ends, the characters' fates are revealed: * Seven hours later, Preston got on a train to Boston. Amanda wrote him a letter for every day that he was away. They are still together. * The day after the party, Denise and Kenny meet up in a diner; five minutes later, Denise dumped Kenny. Ten minutes later, they found a bathroom and got back together. * Mike went to college but, after drinking too much, lost his football scholarship. He ended up forty pounds overweight and working at the car wash, a job he lost when incriminating Polaroids surfaced. * William became one of the most popular students at Harvard. He formed his own computer company that has made him worth millions, and he is dating a supermodel. * William's two nerdy friends were abducted by aliens after discussing that they did not miss anything by not attending the party.

Casper Meets Wendy
 A mysterious "spaceship" floats over a baseball game, eventually revealing Fatso, Stinky and Stretch, [[The Ghostly Trio]], who cause panic in the ballpark. Their nephew [[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper]], a shy, friendly ghost attempts to settle the agitated crowd, but the people are scared of him as well. The park empties, and Casper's uncles plan a vacation.  Meanwhile, an malefic warlock named Desmond Spellman who believes himself the greatest warlock to have existed gets an unwelcome messaged by the Oracle in the Mirror who tells him that in the future, a 10-year-old named [[Wendy the Good Little Witch]] will surpass him in being the greatest witch ever. In response, Desmond plans to get rid of her with the advised "Mystic Abyss". He creates two henchmen: Jules and Vincent, and assigns them to bring Wendy to him.  Wendy is living in the country with her three witch aunts, Gert, Gabby, and Fanny. Jules and Vincent arrive to abduct Wendy, who narrowly escapes with her aunts. To keep Wendy safe from Desmond, her aunts hide and vacation at a resort hotel, which happens to be the same place in which Casper and his uncles are vacationing.  Casper and Wendy meet in a barn and, due to their nice personalities and having been bossed around by their respective relatives, become great friends. Realizing that her aunts and his uncles might not get along because ghosts and witches are natural enemies, Casper gets his uncles to haunt a dance, to which Wendy convinces her aunts to attend. The Ghostly Trio [[spirit possession|possess]] three men at the party and flirt with the three witches.  Though everything seems to go well, the plan is foiled when the possession wears off and the ghosts' real selves are revealed to Wendy's aunts, who threaten them with magic. However, as Wendy explains to Casper, she and her aunts can't use powerful magic or else Desmond will be able to track them down. She begs Casper not to tell anyone about this. Unfortunately, when the Trio suspects Casper is protecting the witches, they pressure Casper into confessing that the witches cannot use their magic, prompting the Trio to attack Wendy and her aunts. Wendy feels she has no choice but to cast a spell on them, covering them in plaster, thus alerting Desmond's magic tracker.  Wendy, distraught that Casper broke his promise, ends their friendship. After trying to escape the resort the witches are then found by Desmond and his henchmen. After confronting the witches Desmond explains the Oracle's prediction and after trying to resist him Desmond casts Wendy into the Mystic Abyss to destroy her, but Casper dives in to save her. Her aunts try to fight Desmond but are not powerful enough. Yet before Desmond can turn the witches into fertilizer, a giant three-eyed monster pops up and frightens the evil warlock, turning the tables and along with Wendy's broom pushing him causing him to fall into the Abyss himself. The monster turns out to be the Ghostly Trio, who combined their powers to defeat him. While they hold the Abyss open, Wendy's aunts pull her and Casper out. Now saved, the two reconcile their friendship. The Oracle proclaims that Wendy is the greatest witch because she did something no other witch ever could: She befriended a ghost. Casper, his uncles, Wendy, and her aunts all bid each other goodbye, and Casper and Wendy assure each other they will meet again soon. Before flying back home with her aunts, Wendy gives Casper a goodbye kiss and his face blushed bright red.  
Cats (1998 film)
 [[Image:CatsGroup.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Partial cast of the filmed version of ''Cats''.]]    The musical centres on the "Jellicle Tribe", a tribe of cats who meet once a year at the Jellicle Ball, where they rejoice with their leader, Old Deuteronomy. During the Jellicle Ball, only one of the cats will be selected by Old Deuteronomy to go to the Heaviside Layer, be reborn and come back to a different life, which is known as a "Jellicle Life", just before dawn. The cats who may be considered for this honour, introduce themselves.  '''Act 1''' The musical starts out with an overture. During that, lots of eyes of what they're known as "Jellicle Cats", which are known as "Jellicle Eyes" glow at the audience in an empty junkyard, from one to many. The cats now shut their eyes off and a few start to gather on stage and ask to the audience about what they can and do as a Jellicle Cat, on purpose, by singing ''Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats'', as the rest joins in. The cats then see and hear a man from the audience asking to them, "What's a Jellicle Cat?", which they questioned it back, being annoyed by that. To answer that, in unison, they explain to him, and the rest of the audience, about different cats' names, by reciting the ''Naming of Cats'' poem.  Munkustrap appears and introduces the first cat: Jennyanydots (''The Old Gumbie Cat''). She "sits and sits and sits" all day and rules over the mice and teaches various activities to them. Jennyanydots finishes, greets the other cats, but is interrupted.  The music instantly changes and The Rum Tum Tugger makes an extravagant entrance (''The Rum Tum Tugger''). The Rum Tum Tugger is a tom with a wild mane and leopard spots on his chest. He is very fickle and unappeasable, "for he will do as he do do and there's no doing anything about it". He flirts with various she-cats in the tribe until his music is cut short at the end of his song.  An old grey cat stumbles out and looks around. It is Grizabella. All the cats back away and glare at her with resentment. The cats sing of her saddened, unfortunate state (''Grizabella: The Glamour Cat''), with Demeter elaborating.  Grizabella leaves and the music becomes upbeat. Bustopher Jones, a fat cat in "a coat of fastidious black", appears (''Bustopher Jones: The Cat About Town''). Bustopher Jones is among the elite of the cats, belonging to many clubs.  There is a loud crash, and Macavity, the most wanted criminal cat, is thought to have appeared, and all the cats flee the yard. However, two black and orange Toyger cats sneak out. They are Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer, two petty thieves, who are very mischievous, and enjoy causing trouble for their human family, leaving them wondering "Which was which cat?" (''Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer'').  Soon, the Jellicle Patriarch, Old Deuteronomy, appears (''Old Deuteronomy''). He is a large old cat that “has lived many lives” and “buried nine wives”. He is the one who will choose which Jellicle cat will go to the Heaviside Layer.  Munkustrap and the cats proceed to entertain Old Deuteronomy with the story of two dog tribes clashing in the streets, but were scared away by a superhero-like cat called the Great [[Rumpus Cat]]. ("The Awful Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles").  Another loud crash is heard, and the cats again suspect Macavity is around. He appears lurking in the shadows, but withdraws. And the cats come out again ("The Song of the Jellicles"). Munkustrap once again states why the cats are there and the celebration begins (''The Jellicle Ball'').  Grizabella shows up once again refusing to be left out of the festivities. Once again, she is shunned by the other cats, but that does not stop her from singing (''Memory'').  '''Act 2'''  Grizabella leaves and the cats, led by Old Deuteronomy and Jemima, sing of "What happiness is" (''The Moments of Happiness'').  Gus shuffles forward (''Gus: The Theatre Cat''). He is the cat that once was a famous actor but now he is old and “suffers from palsy that makes his paws shake”. He is accompanied by Jellylorum, who sings of his exploits in the theatre.  Skimbleshanks is sleeping in the corner. He is unofficially in charge of the railway train. He is very clever and very important because, "they must find him, or the train can't start." (''Skimbleshanks: The Railway Cat'').  Another crash and an evil laugh is heard. It is indeed Macavity. He kidnapps Old Deuteronomy with his henchcats, and Demeter and Bombalurina sing of his crimes (Macavity: The Mystery Cat). Suddenly, Old Deuteronomy comes back again, led by a few henchcats, but Demeter realises "Old Deuteronomy" is an imposter and exposes him to the rest of the tribe. It is Macavity in disguise. Macavity battles against Munkustrap, Alonzo, and many other cats, after trying to kidnap Demeter, eventually escaping, and turning off all the lights in the junkyard in the process.  The Rum Tum Tugger suggests they find Mr. Mistoffelees to help them look for Old Deuteronomy (''Mr. Mistoffelees: The Conjuring Cat''). Mr. Mistoffelees is black and small and can perform many feats of magic that no other cat can do (including producing "Seven Kittens, right out of a hat" ), and succeeds in bringing back Old Deuteronomy, and also turning the junkyard's lights on. He is praised by all the cats.  The Jellicle choice can now be made. Old Deuteronomy sits down and Grizabella appears for the final time. Old Deuteronomy allows her to have a chance to address the cats. Her faded appearance and lonely disposition have little effect on her song (''"[[Memory (Cats song)|Memory]]"'').  The appeal succeeds and she is chosen to be the one (''Journey to the Heaviside Layer''). A large tire rises up with Old Deuteronomy and Grizabella. Once at the top Grizabella finishes the journey herself. Old Deuteronomy gives his last speech to the cats (''The Ad-dressing of Cats'') and the show ends.  
Caresses
 [[Barcelona]] is the scenario for eleven entwined stories sharing the same characters. The movie deals with a variety of intimate relationships, portraying characters who have to experience intense emotions which cannot be materialised in caresses. Connections explored include several different family and romantic relationships across different genders, ages and generations.  A recurring theme is the irony of how difficult communication can be, even when there is close contact. Partial expression, instincts vs. emotions and physical communication all play a part.  
Carnival of Souls (1998 film)
  Although this film is a remake of 1962's ''Carnival of Souls'', it bears little resemblance to the original aside from the ending. This film centers on Alex Grant ([[Bobbie Phillips]]) who witnesses a carnival clown named Louis Seagram ([[Larry Miller (entertainer)|Larry Miller]]) [[rape|raping]] and murdering her mother on January 24, 1977. Twenty years later, Seagram returns after being released from prison and attacks Alex in her car. She drives the car into the river, and as she struggles back to shore she has hallucinations of Seagram and the same carnival where she met him. Alex is then drawn into a ghoulish game of cat and mouse with Seagram at the carnival.  
Caught Up (film)
  Daryl Allen (Bokeem Woodbine), who narrates, is an ex-con. After serving time on drug charges, he plans to get his life straight, open up a nightclub and be a part of his son Jerome's life. His friend Trip offers to give him money for his business and Daryl accepts. Daryl drives Trip to the bank, unaware he's taking part in a robbery, which makes him furious. The police chase them down and Daryl and Trip are involved in a car accident, which leads Trip getting killed and Daryl sent back to the slammer for a long stretch.  During that period, his girlfriend Trish (Cynda Williams) gets married and moves away with their son. Released after five years, Daryl meets his parole officer (Tony Todd) and is informed that if he gets into trouble again, he will serve 25 to life in prison. Daryl is unemployed when he meets a psychic woman named Vanessa Dietrich (Williams). Daryl and Vanessa seem to hit it off at first but a man in a black jacket and mask shoots and tries to kill them. Vanessa gives Daryl a gun and Daryl uses it to scare the man away. Daryl and Vanessa go to Daryl's apartment and Daryl tells Vanessa that she can stay as possible.  The next morning Daryl wakes up to a man, who puts a gun to his head. The man reveals himself as Billy, who is a friend of Vanessa. Billy tells Daryl that the gun is empty and that he was just testing him. Furious, Daryl hits Billy to the floor when Vanessa walks in and tells him that she has gotten him work as a limo driver. At first, Daryl refuses, since he doesn't like Billy, but he later changes his mind and takes the job. He meets a man named Herbert (Clifton Powell), who also works for Billy. Daryl and Herbert get along real well and find out that they have things in common. Later, Vanessa reads Daryl his future through tarot cards and Daryl realizes that the cards describe him in a lot of ways.  Vanessa and Daryl go to a club so Daryl can see how much things have changed since he went to prison. When they leave, the gunman from before shows up again and shoots at them. Daryl realizes that he gets shot at every time he's with Vanessa, leading him to believe that she knows something. Vanessa tells him that she suspects her ex-lover Ahmad is after her, but she doesn't know how he found her. Daryl doesn't believe Vanessa and refuses to speak or see her again, thinking that she will get him into trouble.  One late night, Daryl gets a call from Billy, who asks him to deliver a car for a client. The car gets a flat tire and Daryl opens the trunk to get the spare tire and finds a dead body in the trunk. While trying to change the tire, a police officer pulls up and asks him what happened. Daryl tries to explain what happened when the trunk opens up and the cop walks over to the car. Thinking that it will lead him to back to prison for life, Daryl picks up a tire iron and tries to knock the cop out, only to discover the cop close the trunk and does not find the body.  Daryl heads to Billy's office, beats him up, threatens him and quits the job. On the way back to his apartment, Daryl is arrested. Herbert walks in and reveals to Daryl that he is really a cop named Frank Lowden, who has been investigating Billy's business for months. He orders Daryl to go back on the job and that he is now working for him.  Daryl goes to Vanessa's apartment and orders her to tell him what has he gotten her into. Vanessa tells Daryl about Ahmad, the guy she mentioned before, and that he gave her a diamond that's worth half a million dollars. Daryl believes her but refuses to get involved in her situation, but he stays the night with her. The next morning, Daryl wakes up with blood on his hands and notices that Vanessa has been murdered. The police show up and Daryl escapes out the window. Daryl is now charged with killing Vanessa and now he has to find out who the real killer is. He goes back to his old hood and buys a gun from an old friend. Daryl goes to Billy's house and asks him about Ahmad, but Billy doesn't know who he is. Billy orders his bodyguard to come and hurt Daryl, but Daryl hides in the closet.  Suddenly, Billy's bodyguard is killed by Ahmad (Basil Wallace), a Jamaican mobster. Ahmad orders his men to tie Billy to a chair and he asks Billy how to find Daryl, since he is wanted for murdering Vanessa. Billy asks him why he's looking for Daryl and what can he do to help. Ahmad tells Billy a story about Vanessa, saying that she was his lover and she had helped him steal a case of diamonds. However, she betrayed him and took the diamonds for herself and disappeared and Ahmad has been looking for her since then.  Ahmad offers Billy one diamond and once again asks him where Daryl is. Billy tells Ahmad that Daryl is in the closet, but Ahmad doesn't believe him. Ahmad tells his men to kill Billy, thinking he is playing tricks on him, but instead he shows Billy a small bottle of sulfuric acid. Ahmad then tells one of his bodyguards to put a little drop of it on top of Billy's head, but the bodyguard accidentally puts too much and kills Billy. Ahmad orders his other bodyguard to check the closet. The bodyguard does and Daryl is hiding on top of the ceiling. As Ahmad and his men leave, Daryl exits the closet.  Daryl decides to leave town since he thinks he has nothing to stay for. He then pulls over and makes a call to Trisha's husband, Roger (LL Cool J). Roger tells Daryl that he and Trish had a fight and Trish left and has been gone for over a week. Daryl then asks Roger if can he speak to Jerome. He tells Jerome to stay out of trouble and hangs up. Thinking he will never be a part of his son's life, Daryl continues to leave town. He starts to have flashbacks and realizes he's making a mistake and goes back to L.A. Daryl goes to Vanessa's grave and digs up her body. He then pulls out a knife and cuts a piece of Vanessa's clothing and is shocked to discover that it is his ex-girlfriend, Trish.  Daryl follows Lowden to a house and waits for him to leave. He enters the house and sees that Vanessa is alive and she's the one who killed Trish and framed him in order to get Ahmad and his crew away from her. Daryl begins to take Vanessa to the police, but he is knocked out and handcuffed by Lowden. Lowden is revealed to be a crooked cop who was actually in on the whole thing with Vanessa and they both planned to sell the diamonds for money. Suddenly, Ahmad and his crew kill one of the guards and confront Vanessa and Lowden.  As Daryl begins to wake up, Ahmad orders Vanessa to give him the diamonds. Daryl notices a lamp on a table next to him. Suddenly, Vanessa, Lowden, Ahmad and his crew have a big shootout as Daryl attempts to knock the lamp over and break it. The shootout involves everyone being killed except Daryl. Before Vanessa dies, she tells Daryl that she never stopped loving him, despite what she has put him through. Daryl takes a bag of money and calls Jake from a pay phone. As Daryl explains the whole situation to Jake, he tells them that Ahmad and his crew were the ones who shot at him and Vanessa twice. However, Jake tells Daryl that Ahmad didn't know where Vanessa was until he heard that she was dead. Shocked, Daryl soon realizes that Vanessa was wrong and it wasn't Ahmad after all. Suddenly, the gunman from the last two times smashes into Daryl's car knocking him out.  As Daryl wakes up, the gunman finally confronts him, aiming his gun at him. Daryl asks who he is and the gunman reveals himself as a former security guard in the bank that his friend, Trip robbed. Trip also shot off the guard's private parts while robbing the bank, which is the reason why he has been stalking Daryl in order to kill him for revenge. Daryl tries to tell the gunman that it wasn't his fault and soon realizes that the gunman's actions resulted in Trish being killed. Angry, Daryl tries to attack the gunman but the gunman shoots him in the river below and commits suicide. Daryl suddenly comes back up and is still alive, due to the bulletproof vest he bought from a friend. With the money he took from Vanessa, Daryl is now the owner of his own club and his son, Jerome, lives with him. The film ends with Daryl saying: "Life is just a game, but to win you gotta avoid getting caught up."  
Captive (1998 film)
  After a [[failed suicide attempt]], Samantha Hoffman finds herself trapped in an [[insane asylum]].  
The Catcher
  Sick of his baseball-obsessed father Frank's abuse, a boy beats him to death with a bat while practicing in 1981. Seventeen years later, [[catcher]] David J. Walker of The Devils is kicked out of a baseball game attended by [[Scout (sport)|scouts]], and is blamed when The Devils lose. On the same day, David's girlfriend leaves, tired of him putting his love of baseball before her, and he is informed by Coach Foster that his contract is not being renewed.  Elsewhere, in a stadium locker room, Tyrone Jackson of The Wombats, who had just scored a major contract, is bludgeoned by someone wearing a catcher's uniform. Tyrone's assailant proceeds to delete David's file from the Devils' computer system, which they infect with a virus. The catcher's next victim is Devils player, and assistant coach Terry's fiancé Billy. He is taped onto a table, and is [[sodomy |sodomized]] with a baseball bat. Out on the field, one of the [[Sports commentator|commentators]] notices the catcher taking swings at non-existent balls, drilled by visions of Frank, who calls the catcher "Johnny". When the announcer goes to investigate, he is incapacitated, tied down to [[Baseball field#Home plate|home plate]], and killed when Johnny runs the bases, and kicks him in the head as he slides into home.  In her office, Terry notices that her computer has made a list (everyone killed by Johnny so far) and that it is typing out more names on its own. David drops by to deal with paperwork related to his dismissal, but since the computer system is down and the antivirus program will take a while to fix it, he and Terry go to a lunchroom being cleaned by the janitor, Carl. David's erratic behavior causes Terry to storm back to her office, where the computer still refuses to work. Carl barges in, and leads Terry and David to a large amount of blood he has found.

As that occurs, Carl tells Terry that it is the anniversary of the day Johnny McIntosh (the boy from the intro) bludgeoned his father, and that when Johnny was arrested he swore he would one day return. Terry dismisses Carl's story, until the two find Billy's body. The duo goes to look for David, and find him in the batting cages with Coach Foster's corpse. The two are convinced that David is the killer, and try to escape through the front gate, but David catches up to them, and a fight breaks out between him and Carl. David knocks Carl out, takes his keys, and chases after Terry, with the two of them encountering Johnny, who kills Carl.  Terry and David flee, but Johnny catches them, knocks them unconscious, and places them on the field, which has been decorated with the bodies of all the male victims. A bat-wielding Johnny enters the field (which he hallucinates is full of spectators and players) and goes to home base, where David is bound and dressed like a catcher. Johnny forces Terry to be his [[pitcher]], hits the third ball she throws, and drags her along as he runs the bases, distracting him and allowing David time to escape his binds. David and Johnny (who are dressed identically) fight, and Terry stabs one of them with a splintered bat, realizing too late it was David. As Johnny strangles Terry, she is saved by Anthony's girlfriend, and together the two bash Johnny's head in.

 [[File:Estação Central do Brasil.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Estação Central do Brasil]], the most famous and important railway station in Brazil. Also served as the setting and title of the famous film.]] Dora is a retired schoolteacher who has become embittered. She works at [[Central do Brasil|Rio de Janeiro's Central Station]], writing letters for illiterate customers, in order to make ends meet. She can be impatient with her customers and sometimes does not mail the letters that she writes, putting them in a drawer or even tearing them up. Josué is a poor 9-year-old boy who has never met his father, but hopes to do so. His mother sends letters to his father through Dora, saying that she hopes to reunite with him soon, but when she is killed in a bus accident just outside the train station, the boy is left homeless. Dora takes him in and traffics him to a corrupt couple, but she is made to feel guilty by her neighbor and friend Irene and later steals him back.  Dora is initially reluctant to be responsible for the boy, but ends up deciding to take a trip with him to [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Brazil]] in order to find his father's house and leave him there.  Dora tries to leave Josué on the bus, but he follows her, forgetting his backpack containing Dora's money. Penniless, they are picked up by a kind, Evangelical truck driver who abandons them when Dora encourages him to drink beer and then grows too friendly. Dora trades her watch for a ride to [[Juazeiro do Norte|Bom Jesus do Norte]]. They find his father's address in Bom Jesus, but the current residents say that Jesus won a house in the lottery, and now lives in the new settlements, adding that he lost the house and money through drinking. With no money, Josué saves them from destitution by suggesting Dora write letters for the pilgrims who have arrived in Bom Jesus for a massive pilgrimage. This time she posts the letters.  They take the bus to the settlements, but when they locate the address they have for Josué's father, they are told by the new residents that he no longer lives there and has disappeared. Josué tells Dora that he will wait for him, but Dora invites him to live with her. She calls Irene in Rio and asks her to sell her refrigerator, sofa and television. She says that she will call when she gets settled somewhere. After she hangs up, she learns that there are no buses leaving until the next morning.  Isaías, one of Josué's half-brothers, is working on a roof next to the bus stop, and learns that they are looking for his father. After introducing himself, Dora says that she is a friend of his father and was in the area. Isaías insists that she and Josué, who, suspicious of the stranger, has introduced himself as Geraldo, come to dinner. They return to his house, where they meet Moisés, the other half-brother. Later, Isaías explains to Dora that their father married Ana, who he doesn't know is Josué's mother, after their mother died, and that nine years ago, while pregnant, Ana left her drunken lover for Rio and never returned. Isaías asks Dora to read a letter that his father wrote to Ana when he disappeared, six months ago, in case she returned. In the letter, the boys' father explains that he has gone to Rio to find Ana and the son he has never met. He promises to return, asks her to wait for him, and says they can all be together—himself, Ana, Isaías and Moisés. At this point Dora pauses, looks at Josué and says, "and Josué, whom I can't wait to meet." Isaías and Josué both say that he will return, but Moisés doesn't think so. The next morning, while the sons sleep, Dora sneaks out to catch the bus for Rio.  She first leaves beside the letter from Jesus the one from Ana to Jesus, the one Dora carried with her from the Central Station but never mailed, expressing Ana's wish for the family to be reunited. Josué wakes up too late to prevent her departure. Dora writes a letter to Josué on the bus. Both are left with the photos they had taken by which to remember one another.

She then dumps fertilizer into the silo, killing the corn god in multiple explosions.  Alison then goes to Lily's house (Jacob's wife).

It observes the ending of the traditional English village way of life, with the arrival of motor cars and electricity, the death of the local [[squire]], and the declining influence of the church. As part of that breaking-down process, Lee's father deserts his family, leaving his wife to bring up eight children. A central theme is Lee's awakening sexuality, as he grows older, and the title refers to his first flirtation, with a village girl called Rosie.   The main action of the film ends before Lee departs on his early travels, which are dealt with in ''[[As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning]]''.  ''Videohound'' says of the film "Laurie's childhood consists of school, church, village festivals, eccentric relations and neighbors, and the usual childhood tribulations".<ref>''VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever 2001'' (Gale, 2000), p. xlix</ref>  
A Civil Action (film)
 Environmental toxins in the city of [[Woburn, Massachusetts]] contaminate the area's water supply, and become linked to a number of deaths of neighboring children. Jan Schlichtmann ([[John Travolta]]), a cocky and successful Boston attorney who zips around town in his [[Porsche]], and his small firm of personal injury lawyers are asked by Woburn resident Anne Anderson ([[Kathleen Quinlan]]) to take legal action against those responsible.  After originally rejecting a seemingly unprofitable case, Jan finds a major [[environmental issue]] involving groundwater contamination that has great legal potential and a couple of defendants with deep pockets. The local  [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]] could be responsible for several deadly cases of leukemia, but also are the main employers for the area. Jan decides to go forward against two giant corporations (real-life companies [[Beatrice Foods]] and [[W. R. Grace and Company]]) with links to the tanneries, thinking that the case could possibly earn him millions, as well as enhancing his and his firm's already considerable reputation.  Bringing a [[class action]] lawsuit in federal court, Jan represents families who demand a clean-up of contaminated areas and an apology. However, the case develops a life of its own and takes over the lives of Jan and his firm. The lawyers for the tanneries' parent corporations are not easy to intimidate, a judge ([[John Lithgow]]) makes a key ruling against the plaintiffs, and soon Jan and his partners find themselves in a position where their professional and financial survival has been staked on the outcome of the case.  Jan stubbornly declines settlement offers, gradually coming to believe that the case is about more than just the money. He allows his pride to take over, making outrageous demands and deciding that he must win at all costs. Pressures take their toll, with Jan and his partners going deeply into debt. After a lengthy trial, the case is dismissed in favor of Beatrice, Jan having turned down an offer of $20 million from Beatrice attorney Jerry Facher ([[Robert Duvall]]) while the jury was deliberating. The plaintiffs are forced to accept a settlement with Grace that barely covers the expense involved in trying the case, leaving Jan and his partners broke. The families are deeply disappointed, and Jan's partners dissolve their partnership, effectively breaking up the firm. Jan ends up alone, living in a small apartment and running a small-time law practice. He manages to find the last key witness to the case, but lacks resources and courage to appeal the judgement. The files are archived while Jan later files for bankruptcy.  In a postscript, a montage of short scenes involving the key characters in the film, combined with on-screen captions, reveals that the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], building on Jan's work on the case, later brought its own enforcement action against the offending companies, forcing them to pay millions to clean up the land and the groundwater. It takes Jan several years to settle his debts, and he now practices environmental law in Toms River, New Jersey.  ===Differences from the book===  The plotline has been greatly simplified from the book, e.g. later findings by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] and its potential consequences that might have allowed the plaintiffs another trial against Beatrice, and which did ultimately lead to a conviction of [[perjury]] against John Riley, and improper conduct for Mary Ryan, are referred to only briefly in the epilogue.  The characters [[Charles Nesson]], Mark Phillips, Rikki Klieman, Teresa Padro and others have been removed from the film version, as well as the plot points that they contribute.

Before long, she begins to receive suspicious phone calls; at work, she is called to the phone and when she answers there is no one on the line. At home in the middle of the night she receives another call. After hanging up, the phone rings again. She feels unsafe, that perhaps Roland has found her, and so she leaves her apartment and walks to a nearby bar. As soon as she walks in, she sits down at a man's table, asking if he is waiting for someone. When he says no, she asks him to dance with her. Claire and Elton dance for a few hours and we next see her waking up in his bed the next morning. It is apparent that she picked up someone to take her home with them, for a safe place to spend the night. When she arrives home, she feels something is out of place.  He watches her speak to someone (Roland), then follows her to a hotel where she stays for quite some time, then gives up waiting.  At Dolan's apartment, there is a knock on her door. Elton confronts her about who she really is, where she lives, and asks if she has a pimp and if she owes him any money. Over the next few days/weeks, they go to work and meet afterward. It is obvious that Elton has feelings for her, and the two exchange I-love-you's. Elton goes to see Roland, who has been expecting him. Roland  grabs the other man by the throat and tells him Claire always was and always will be a whore and that he should get out while he can.  It is implied she may be his own daughter. He also speaks with an Eastern European prostitute in a hotel room, but seems uninterested in having sex with her, and asks her some questions. He returns to the city. Claire has gone to the doctor and checks out okay. She continues to see a few clients, but during one visit, she thinks she sees Elton's reflection on the balcony outside and goes to the window, cracking it to look out. Her client comes into the room and has her leave it open for the air, and they carry on, with Elton on the balcony.  Now having enough money to pay off her debt, she goes to pay off Roland. He asks her if she is going to keep her baby, then congratulates her, offering her a packet of money "for the baby" but she refuses. He insists, but she continues to refuse his money as it would be something Roland could hold over her in the future. She goes home, packs a suitcase with an air of finality, and goes to the airport.   Elton is walking down the street with a blond woman when Roland passes by and stops him to say hello. Elton introduces the woman as his wife, and she and Roland talk for a moment. She is seven months pregnant with a girl.

Because they were poor as children, their family chose to sacrifice Bette and launch only Adeline into an advantageous marriage due to her greater beauty, a fact which has caused Bette much hardship and regret in life.   Believing the death of Adeline to result in reward at last, Bette is stricken and infuriated when what she believes to be a proposal of marriage and an offer of a true place in the family from Baron Hulot is, in fact, an offer of employment to work as their (unpaid) [[housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]].  Bette returns to her humble apartment and continues her meager living as the costume maker for a [[Burlesque]] theater, where she becomes friends with the headliner of the show: the famed [[courtesan]], (and Baron Hulot's mistress,) Jenny Cadine ([[Elizabeth Shue]]), and saves the life of a young and handsome [[sculptor]] living in her building: the displaced and impoverished [[Count]] Wenceslas Steinbach ([[Aden Young]]).

Instead, it is a policeman, who informs him that Marion has been killed in an apparent hit-and-run.  Jack finishes his book and gets it published anonymously. It is a big success, but he doesn't change anything about his life, continuing to work as a croupier and live in his basement flat, not even buying the new car he wanted.

Then she puts his father on the phone, and he implies that he set up the croupier job for Jack in order to arrange for the attempted robbery, and he benefited as well.

Curse of the Puppet Master
  The film begins at ''The House of Marvels'', a doll museum, with [[Andre Toulon|André Toulon's]] [[puppets]] in a cage, watching their current master, a man named Dr. Magrew (George Peck), stuffing something into a crate. Before leaving, he promises the puppets that things will be different next time. He drives into the woods, where he puts down the crate and douses it with gasoline, then sets it on fire. From inside the crate, faint screaming can be heard. The next morning, Dr. Magrew's daughter, Jane ([[Emily Harrison]]), has just returned home from college. She asks her father about Matt, his assistant. Her father tells her that Matt left, since his father was ill. He and Jane decide to drive into town to take their minds off things. Robert "Tank" Winsley (Josh Green), a very tall but meek young man, works at the gas station in town. He passes his time by carving small wooden statues. He is frequently harassed by [[bullying|bully]] Joey Carp ([[Michael D. Guerin]]). Jane and Dr. Magrew arrive and tell Joey to get lost. Jane finds one of the statues that Robert was carving and complements him on it, then shows it to her father. Dr. Magrew introduces himself and Jane to Robert, and offers Robert a job helping him with the Marvel show. Robert accepts and they drive back to the house.  Upon arriving, they introduce Robert to Toulon's puppets, which amaze him, since they're alive. At dinner, Magrew reveals that he bought the puppets at an [[auction]] years ago, and that he tried to make a living puppet just like Toulons', but has never been successful. He asks Robert if he'll help him carve the puppet, to which he agrees. The next day, during the show, the town [[sheriff]], Sheriff Garvey ([[Robert Donavan]]) and Deputy Wayburn ([[Jason-Shane Scott]]) arrive. They tell Magrew that Matt is missing, and they wonder if Magrew's seen him since he left. He insists that he has not, but they do not quite believe him. That night, Magrew gives Robert the wood and the [[blueprints]] for the puppet. Robert does not understand how the puppet will live. Magrew tells him the way to make a dead thing live is: "You put your [[soul]] into it". Robert begins carving and works non-stop. At dinner a few nights later, Magrew reveals that Matt did carving for him as well. While Matt's work had quality, Robert's work has perfection, which is what he wants to make. He uses Blade as an example: "He never tires, never hungers, knows no fear, tells no lies, feels no pain, knows no secrets. And what is man except a being at war with himself? But not Blade. He has no hidden motives, no secret self. He is purely and perfectly what he is. In fact, I think the world would be a better place if we were all like him."  That night, Robert wakes up and finds that his legs have turned into carved, wooden legs, like a puppet. But this ends up being a [[nightmare]]. While Robert carves the puppet, Jane thinks he is working too hard and while trying to get his attention, causes him to cut himself. She bandages the cut on his hand for him, and asks him about himself. He reveals that he is an orphan, and he has never been smart enough to go to college. Jane tells him that his hands can do things that people with brains only imagine being able to do. They both develop feelings for one another and kiss. Later that night, Robert has another nightmare, but this time, his entire body (minus his head) is wooden, complete with inner [[clockwork]] [[gears]]. The next day, Jane, thinking that Robert is working too hard, convinces him to take a break. They drive to the woods, and Jane tells him about a beautiful clearing in the woods she found as a little girl. On the way, they stumble upon the half-burnt box that Dr. Magrew burned at the film's beginning.  Robert reaches in and pulls out a carved wooden hand, much like a puppet hand. He tries to show it to Jane, but she is walking away. Meanwhile, Joey and his friends are in the woods when Jane arrives. Joey begins to harass her and steps in her way, blocking her. She continuously shoves him to the point where he is angry, and he [[sexual harassment|sexually harasses]] her. Robert arrives and tells Joey to leave her alone. Joey ignores Robert and threatens to rape Jane. Finally, Robert snaps and throws Joey onto the hood of his car and begins choking him. Jane pulls him off, and they drive back to the house. At the house, Robert confesses that when he was choking Joey, it had nothing to do with him or Jane. He felt like he was choking all the things that ever plagued him in his life. Dr. Magrew tells Robert that he is at war with himself: "There's another self inside, a true or more natural self. A creature of violence, with no fear, no conscience. A killer. You spend your whole life battling the self that lives inside. And what happened today, though just for a moment, you lost that battle. The real you, the true you, came out." Robert does not know if he is right or not, but he would "rather die than have it come out again."  Later that night, Joey comes to the "House of Marvels" to beat Robert up, but then decides to try to rape Jane again. As Jane sees him and tells him to get out, Pinhead, who was in the room, jumps at Joey and starts choking him, but Joey pulls him off and then starts squashing him with his foot, breaking off his left hand, and breaks his right arm. Dr. Magrew and Tank show up, but Joey makes a run for it. Dr. Magrew, who wants revenge, takes Blade and Tunneler to Joey's house, and sends them to kill him. Joey, who's lifting weights, gets his forehead slashed by Blade, and gets his [[crotch]] drilled by Tunneler. Back at the house, Robert shows up at Jane's room and shows her that he fixed Pinhead, Jane thanks Robert, then they start to kiss, she then tells him that he can stay if he likes, then they kiss again. As Dr. Magrew comes back, he sees Robert coming out of Jane's room, and then decides to talk to Jane, and is then surprised when he sees that Pinhead's fixed, but then he starts going crazy when Jane says she loves Robert, and tells her that he does not want to see her get hurt, and then leaves. Five days later, Friday, Jane finds Robert very sick, and then has her father call the doctor, but he really does not, he just fakes it. Then he tells Jane that he has to go pick up a stuffed mermaid oddity for the "House of Marvels" at the post office at the edge of town, and tricks Jane into offering to picking it up for him, while Dr. Magrew waits for the non-coming doctor to come. Back at Joey's house, the [[medical examiner]] ([[William Frederick Knight|William Knight]]) believes that Joey's death was [[intentional]]. Sheriff Garvey starts to ask one of Joey's friends, named Art ([[Marc Newburger]]), when was the last time they saw Joey and who else was there, and he says last Sunday in the woods, and Mr. Magrew's daughter was there. Hearing the name Magrew, Sheriff Garvey and Deputy Wayburn decide to give Dr. Magrew a little visit. But as Garvey and Wayburn arrive at the House of Marvels, Six Shooter throws a rope around Wayburn's neck and Pinhead pulls the rope, causing him to fall and gets his head tunneled by Tunneler, killing him. At the same time, Blade slashes Garvey's leg, making him fall and drop his gun, and then he and Jester start slashing his face, with Magrew laughing as he watches them kill. Meanwhile at the [[post office]], Jane keeps asking the shipping agent ([[Patrick Thomas (actor)|Patrick Thomas]]) if he is sure what her father ordered is not there, so the agent calls Tommy Berke ([[J.R. Bookwalter]]) to ask him will it come in, but Tommy says that Magrew has not bought anything from him in the past six months.  Hearing this, Jane decides to go back to the woods to see what that burned box was. She sees that it's one of Matt's carved puppets, then it starts to speak: "Jane!" for help in Matt's voice. She then realizes that her father's going to do the same thing to Robert, so she quickly drives back to the House. Meanwhile, at the house, Dr. Magrew puts Robert's soul into the puppet, named [[List of Puppet Master characters|Tank]], he especially made for Robert via [[electricity]], and it finally works this time, but the puppets are angry because they did not want him to kill Robert, so Blade slashes Magrew's legs, hand, and face, Tunneler drills through his leg, and Pinhead hits him with a metal cane. As Jane arrives at the house, she finds her father nearly dead, bleeding to death, with him pointing at Tank, saying "I did it". Suddenly, the Tank Puppet starts to move and points its arm at Dr. Magrew. The arm shoots out a bolt of electricity, and electrocutes Dr. Magrew straight between the eyes. The film ends with a shot of Dr. Magrew screaming before death, and Jane screaming in horrified terror.

 After burying his mother, Rafael Infante ([[Chayanne]]) comes from [[Santiago, Cuba]] to [[Houston, Texas]] to work for a man named John Burnett ([[Kris Kristofferson]]) as a handyman in Burnett's dance studio. It soon becomes clear to the audience that Burnett is the father Rafael never knew. While there he finds himself falling for a dancer and instructor Ruby Sinclair ([[Vanessa Williams|Vanessa L. Williams]]), who incidentally brought him to the studio.   It turns out that the dancers in the studio are preparing for a dance competition in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and that Ruby would be taking part as well. Rafael gets close to Ruby and their attraction to each other grows, but she is not willing to commit herself to a relationship as she seems more interested in her dancing.  Meanwhile, Rafael's arrival and persona wins him the friendship of an older dancer Bea Johnson ([[Joan Plowright]]) as well as the studio receptionist Lovejoy ([[Beth Grant]]), but it also causes some discomfort to Burnett, who suddenly begins to withdraw into himself and takes less interest in the preparations for the competition, much to the chagrin of his own partner Patricia Black ([[Jane Krakowski]]).   While visiting Burnett at his home, Rafael notices and offers to repair his old and broken-down truck. He and Ruby go downtown to get the parts needed to repair the truck and are invited to an engagement party by a Cuban man whose daughter was getting engaged. While there, both of them discover more about each other as he tells her that his mother had died but that he never knew his father.  Later, Rafael invites Ruby to a dance party at a club in the city and they agree to go on the following Saturday night. Before leaving, Rafael helps Patricia learn a [[dance lift]] she had been practicing, explaining that his mother made him take a little ballet. The following Saturday, he and Ruby go to the party in which they perform, along with other dancers, the Latin Salsa dancing to a song by [[Albita Rodriguez]].   After the party, he takes Ruby home where he discovers that she has a 7-year-old son Peter (Chaz Oswill) who is "looked after" by Bea in Ruby's absence and who happens to be fathered by Ruby's former dance partner, Julian Marshall ([[Rick Valenzuela]]). While there, he comes up to Ruby and they share a passionate kiss, but she eventually breaks it up.  Later on Rafael comes to Burnett's home to show him the refurbished truck, to the latter's delight. while there, Patricia comes to the house and has a discussion with John asking him to explain why he suddenly lost interest in their choreography preparations. John then tells her that she can dance with Rafael if she wants and both she and Rafael start their practice to the amazement of the other dancers at the studio.   After the rehearsal, Rafael overhears John telling Lovejoy that Ruby would be in Las Vegas without them and also asking her to switch his name with Rafael's when Patricia's dance comes up.   Sensing that she wants to reunite with Julian, Rafael goes to see Ruby who explains that she wanted Peter to see his father often and that she did not want to be in love. While at a fishing trip with Burnett, Rafael is shocked when Burnett tells him to go back to Cuba after the competition and that he did not have a son. Devastated by the double rejection, he decides to return to Cuba after his dance with Patricia.  At Las Vegas, Rafael meets Ruby and tells her that he was returning to Cuba after the competition. Burnett (who did not go) reflects on his cruel rejection of Rafael and decides to come to the dance to apologize to Rafael and persuade him not to go back to Cuba. Rafael dances with Patricia and while watching them, Ruby realized that she was in love with Rafael and felt a stab of jealousy seeing them together.   Just as Rafael and Patricia leave the stage, Bea comes in, saying, "I wanna do that too" and she and Rafael perform a very humorous dance to the amusement and delight of the crowd. After the dance, Burnett meets and apologizes to Rafael, eventually convinces him to stay back and also commending his dancing.  The main dances begin and Ruby and her partner Julian are involved. Despite the slight tension between them, they win the competition although Ruby almost all the time seems to keep her eyes on Rafael, who is in the audience and who is watching her, however he leaves and when Ruby looked around without seeing him, she breaks down in tears.   Later at a dance party for all the contestants, Ruby is met by a man who wishes to promote her. However, to her relief, Rafael appears again and leads her to the dance floor for a final dance scene that has the rest of the dancers watching with admiration.   The movie ends at the studio with the entire studio members and some new dancers dancing to the theme song "You Are My Home" by Chayanne and Williams themselves.

Dark City (1998 film)
 John Murdoch awakens in a hotel bathtub, suffering from amnesia. He receives a phone call from Dr. Daniel Schreber, who urges him to flee the hotel to evade a group of men who are after him. In the room, Murdoch discovers the corpse of a ritualistically murdered woman along with a bloody knife. He flees the scene, just as the group of men (known as the Strangers) arrive.  Following clues, Murdoch learns his own name and finds out he has a wife named Emma; he is also sought by Police Inspector Frank Bumstead as a suspect in a series of murders committed around the city, though he cannot remember killing anybody. Pursued by the Strangers, Murdoch discovers that he has [[psychokinesis]]—which the Strangers also possess, and refer to as "tuning": the ability to alter reality at will. He manages to use these powers to escape from them.  Murdoch explores the city, where nobody seems to realize it is always night. At midnight, he watches as everyone except himself falls asleep as the Strangers physically rearrange the city as well as changing people's identities and memories. Murdoch learns that he came from a coastal town called Shell Beach: a town familiar to everyone, though nobody knows how to get there, and all of his attempts to do so are unsuccessful for varying reasons. Meanwhile, the Strangers inject one of their men, Mr. Hand, with memories intended for Murdoch in an attempt to predict his movements and track him down.  Murdoch is eventually caught by Inspector Bumstead, who acknowledges Murdoch is most likely innocent, and by then has his own misgivings about the nature of the city. They confront Schreber, who explains that the Strangers are [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrials]] who use corpses as their hosts. Having a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]], the Strangers are experimenting with humans to analyze their individuality in the hopes that some insight might be revealed that will help their race survive.  Schreber reveals that Murdoch is an anomaly who inadvertently awoke when Schreber was in the middle of imprinting his latest identity as a murderer. The three embark to find Shell Beach, but it exists only as a poster on a wall at the edge of the city. Frustrated, Murdoch and Bumstead break through the wall, revealing outer space. The men are confronted by the Strangers, including Mr. Hand, who holds Emma hostage. In the ensuing fight, Bumstead and one of the Strangers fall through the hole into space.  The Strangers bring Murdoch to their home beneath the city and force Schreber to imprint Murdoch with their collective memory, believing Murdoch to be the culmination of their experiments. Schreber betrays them by instead inserting false memories in Murdoch which artificially reestablish his childhood as years spent training and honing his tuning skills and learning about the Strangers and their machines. Murdoch awakens, fully realizing his skills. He frees himself and battles with the Strangers, defeating their leader Mr. Book in a psychokinetic fight high above the city.  After learning from Schreber that Emma has been re-imprinted and cannot be restored, Murdoch exercises his new-found powers, amplified by the Strangers' machine, to create an actual Shell Beach by flooding the area within the force field with water and forming mountains and beaches. On his way to Shell Beach, Murdoch encounters a dying Mr. Hand and informs him that they have been searching in the wrong place—the mind—to understand humanity. Murdoch turns the habitat toward the star it had been turned away from, and the city experiences sunlight for the first time.  He opens a door leading out of the city, and steps out to view the sunrise. Beyond him is a pier, where he finds the woman he knew as Emma, now with new memories and a new identity as Anna. Murdoch reintroduces himself as they walk to Shell Beach, beginning their relationship anew.  
The Day of the Roses
  The film starts at an anniversary commemoration of the crash, where roses are dropped on the track to the aftermath of the wreck where first responders are arriving at the scene. Five months later the coroner, Tom Weir, brings in Boris Osman, an engineer to help him investigate the crash and immediately runs into stonewalling by the state-owned rail company, who don’t want him to examine the train. Osman thinks it’s because the investigation will have to disclose why the tracks that caused the wreck were in such bad shape. Osman thinks it was caused by the politicians in office allowing the rail system to deteriorate. The coroner learns the bridge was hit twice before. Pressure begins to be brought on the coroner from above to stop asking to look at the train. Osman learns this is the third time this locomotive went off the rails. The coroner uses the threat of contempt of court to force the rail company to let Osman examine the locomotive. The inquest begins, with Orman recounting how the tragedy happened on 18 January 1977,  alternating with the stories of  some  passengers who traveled on the ill-fated train, leading up to the depiction of the accident. Due to worn out track and worn out wheels on the locomotive, it  jumps the rails and hits a bridge support, causing it to collapse on the train.  The community springs into action to aid the survivors and recover the 83 dead. Several of the rescuers testify at the inquest and recount their actions on the day of the accident. Many rescuers risk their own lives to save the injured. Even when ordered to leave due to the danger of further collapse, many refuse to abandon injured survivors. Many of the rescuers are traumatized by what they saw. Ormond comes under attack for saying that it was the condition of the locomotive’s wheels that contributed to the accident, since while money has been allocated to repair the tracks, there is no money to also repair the locomotives. The families of the dead try to cope, while Gerry Buchtman, who went to Granville while on sick leave from his emergency responder job has to fight to keep his job, since the powers that be want to fire him for doing just that.  In spite of pressure, the coroner finds that the locomotive’s condition contributed to the accident. Osman later learns that even though the rail company knew this type of locomotive was dangerous due to a derailment 11 months before Granville, they took no steps to lower the speed on this line because it came from an electoral district that often decided national elections and the government did not want to anger the voters by making their train late. We return to the memorial service, while on screen captions tell us what happened to some of the people involved in the crash and the investigation.  
Dangerous Beauty
 [[Veronica Franco]] ([[Catherine McCormack]]) is an adventurous, curious, slightly tomboyish young woman in Venice. Her lover Marco ([[Rufus Sewell]]) cannot marry her because her family is of too low standing to be considered an appropriate match for a senator's son, and not wealthy enough to provide a good dowry. Marco, a future Senator, marries a foreign noblewoman instead. Veronica's mother ([[Jacqueline Bisset]]) must think of the future and her family's financial security, as she still requires dowries for her younger daughters and money for her son's commission. Rather than go to a convent, Veronica's mother suggests she become a [[courtesan]], a highly paid, cultured prostitute like her mother and grandmother before her. At first Veronica is repelled by the idea, but once she discovers that courtesans are allowed access to libraries and education, she tentatively embraces the idea.  Veronica quickly gains a reputation as a top courtesan, impressing the powerful men of Venice with her beauty, wit, and compassion. Marco finds it difficult to adjust to his new wife, who is nothing like Veronica, and becomes jealous as she takes his friends and relatives as lovers. After Marco's cousin Maffio, a poor bard who was once publicly upstaged by Veronica, attacks her, Marco rushes to her aid. They rekindle their romance.  Marco wishes her to stop seeing clients and accept his support instead; she rejects the idea, unwilling to sacrifice her financial independence or accept a faux-wife status.  Nevertheless, she spends a great deal of time with Marco in the country, neglecting her business, and ignoring her mother's warnings that such a relationship is dangerous for her.  The [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–73)|Fourth Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–73)]] breaks out, and the city appeals to France for aid. Veronica is encouraged to seduce the [[Henry III of France|King of France]] and secures a military alliance. Marco accuses her of enjoying being a courtesan, seeming to think she ought to have rejected the King despite the risk to Venice's military and political alliances. Veronica points out that she sacrificed their love for the good of the city, while he only did it to protect his family's political standing, and Marco leaves for war angry. While the Venetians are fighting at sea, a plague hits the city. Religious zealots take the war and plague as punishment for the city's moral degradation, and Veronica's home is quarantined and almost ransacked by a mob.  Veronica is summoned to appear before the [[Inquisition]] on charges of witchcraft and refuses to name her clients. When it appears that she will be executed, Marco publicly shames the Venetian ministers and senators into admitting their own adulteries and sins by standing up in the assembly. Bewildered by the extent of sin in the city, the Inquisitor drops the charges of witchcraft, and Marco and Veronica reconcile.  
The Day Lincoln Was Shot
 The movie shows the events leading up to and after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, as well as a look into the personal lives of both men. Lincoln is relieved that Richmond has fallen and the Civil War is over. He has contentious discussions with his Cabinet about the treatment of the defeated South. They want the Confederates punished while Lincoln argues for mercy. The President is despised by many Southerners and receives numerous death threats. Lincoln has a rather fatalistic attitude about these, however he has a disturbing dream about hearing cries in the White House and seeing a coffin in the East Room surrounded by mourners crying out that an assassin has murdered the President. Booth is the most popular actor in the country (it is pointed out that only Lincoln has his picture taken more). Coming from an acting family, he feels overshadowed by his father and brother and longs to make his mark on history. A fanatical Confederate sympathizer, Booth sees Lincoln as a tyrant and slavery as a proper way of life. He assembles a motley group of Confederates including former Soldier Lewis Paine and simple-minded David Herold. They form a plot to kidnap the President. However, the war ends and Booth is outraged when he hears Lincoln making a speech promising African-Americans citizenship and the vote. His plan to kidnap turns into a murder plot. He decides to assassinate Lincoln at Ford's Theatre and orders Paine to kill Secretary Of State William Seward and orders another accomplice to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson. Booth kills Lincoln and escapes after breaking his leg jumping to the stage. Paine attacks Seward who survives and the Vice President is unharmed. After an intense manhunt, Booth is shot and killed inside a burning barn surrounded by federal troops. He dies on the front porch saying that he died for his country. The credits reveal that Booth's confederates were put on trial and hanged. Ironically, Lincoln's successor Johnson was much harsher on the defeated South than Lincoln would have been.

Dark Harbor
  David Weinberg (Alan Rickman), a lawyer in his 50s, and his much younger wife Alexis (Polly Walker), drive through a torrential rainstorm to get the last ferry to their private island.  They catch sight of an injured young man (Norman Reedus) at the side of the road, whom they reluctantly drive to the nearest town.  Having missed their ferry, the couple checks into a motel, and take the next day's ferry.  The young man (never named in the course of the film), is also on the ferry, though they do not meet.  David and Alexis have a troubled seven-year marriage, punctuated by miscommunication and missed opportunities.  In an attempt to make up for his displays of temper, David arranges a romantic sailing excursion, but this goes terribly wrong when they encounter a fogbank and run aground.  They find the young man camping on the shore, and are invited, after an initial misunderstanding, to share his fire.  David recruits his assistance with ungrounding the sailboat, and invites him into his home.  That evening, Alexis dreams that she has taken a blanket to the young man and that her husband has attacked her in a fit of jealousy.  In the morning, the couple discovers that he has made them a lovely breakfast, and it transpires that David has actually delivered the blanket to him.  David invites the young man to stay for dinner that night to sample his own cooking in a challenge, then leaves to play golf.  Alexis and the man waste time together while downing a bottle of whiskey, talking about themselves and dressing up for fun in the boat house.  He explains that he is a poet, but that he is unable to write and shows Alexis his work, all in different handwriting.  He persuades her to take dictation of a quite dark poem describing drowning.  Eventually they go off on a wild mushroom hunting walk in the nearby woods, and Alexis stops the young man from consuming a mushroom that she says would have killed him in a minute.  She then shows him how to tell the difference between the lethal mushroom he almost ate, and one that looks almost identical, but is in fact an aphrodisiac.  After failing to convince her to eat the aphrodisiac mushroom, they return home, where he apologises.  David returns from golf, claiming to be ill, but he recovers enough to make dinner for his wife and the man when he is reminded of the challenge.  The plans to return the man to town are thwarted, however, when David takes him across on the boat and it dies half-way, leaving the man with no option but to stay with them another night, which he doesn't seem pleased about.  The next morning, however, David provokes an argument with Alexis and gets into a brief fight with the young man, who flees to hide in the shed when David comes after him.  He is driven out of the shed and runs into the woods, David still chasing after him.  When David approaches Alexis in the woods, she tells him that they're through and then finds the young man on the ground.  He seduces her while trying to coerce her into eating one of the mushrooms.  This time, unlike the last, she doesn't stop him from continuing.  A funeral follows, and the young man's poem, written in Alexis' handwriting and signed by her, is read, as if it was her suicide note.  David then returns to the island by boat.  He strips and swims to shore in the icy water, as if stripping off and washing away his former life.  Some time later, someone arrives at the house, seen from the back wearing a hooded jacket. The stranger kisses David, and is revealed to be the young man. It becomes abundantly clear that he and David are lovers, and that Alexis' death was planned by the two of them.  
Dark Soldier D
  Kawamata is a psychotic soldier who fell in with the Russian Special Operation Forces. It was at this time that Kawamata became the guinea pig for this secret scientific research organization. The Russians wanted to ensure that they were ahead of the U.S. in the arms race, and used this organization to develop a mobile combat suit, armed to the teeth with all kinds of weapons imaginable. During his tenure on the project, Kawamata met Matsuzaki, a twisted scientist who was kicked out of Japan for unscrupulous practices. Matsuzaki became lead engineer on the combat suit project and coded Kawamata’s thought impulses into the control mechanism, so only he can operate the walking arsenal. But when Communist Russia collapsed, Kawamata and Matsuzaki stole the armored battle suit and snuck it into Japan.  ===Acts===  * '''Act I'''  Kawamata, a former special forces, who becomes a mercenary for hire. In this part of the story we explore the mind of Kawamata, a wealthy man and an avid collector of military weapons. The monster in Act I is called the Dad Monster, according to Buildup. This monster is a businessman who was infected by the parasite ooze when he got too close to the meteor. He slowly began to turn into a monster; first brutally killing his wife and daughter…then feasting on both them.. Finally, he fully developed into the Dad Monster and goes on a killing spree; shredding people and biting victims in half. Kawamata heard of the monster and was excited to finally test his newly upgraded combat suit. After a couple of minutes of mindless destruction, Kawamata comes out triumphant against the Dad Monster by ripping him to shreds with his trusty machine gun…however…he kills 40+ innocent bystanders in the process.  * '''Act II'''  A year has passed since Kawamata single handedly vanquished the Dad Monster and killed many innocent bystanders in the process. Although he destroyed the monster, Kawamata was sentenced to death for the massacre in Shinjuku, however, the charges against him would be dropped if he cooperated with the government and used the combat suit to fight the meteor monsters, he reluctantly agrees. While in prison, he befriended a fellow inmate named Iba; it seemed that many of the prisoners feared Kawamata or hated him., but Iba didn't fear him because he loved weapons as much as Kawamata did. When a meteor crashes in the suburbs, the parasite ooze infects a chicken which began to eat livestock and the farmer before it ran into the city. The creature starts attacking an amusement park and Kawamata is quickly dispatched to intercept the monster. During the fight, Kawamata loses a leg and an arm; struggling, he barely managed to fight back and defeat the monster.  * '''Act III'''  Sergei and his commandos arrived in Japan to kill Kawamata for stealing one of Russia’s combat suits. Meanwhile, Kawamata’s limbs were replaced by the government. In addition, he began to feel sick and tired of fighting for the government and chose Iba as his successor to the combat suit. Sergei arrived at Kawamata’s home and successfully killed him despite Iba’s attempts to protect his mentor. Suddenly, another meteor appeared and was secured by Sergei’s commandoes, but in a freak accident, the meteor thawed from its confinement and the ooze infected Sergei turning him into the Combat Suit Monster and went on a rampage and ate the other commandos. Now it was up to Iba to fight this beast.  The end of the movie ended in a [[cliffhanger]], where Kawamata’s brain is preserved for study; further denying him any peace even after death.  
Deep Impact (film)
  On May 10, 1998, teenaged amateur astronomer Leo Biederman ([[Elijah Wood]]) discovers an unusual object near the stars [[Mizar and Alcor]] at a [[star party]]. His teacher has Leo take a picture and then sends it to astronomer Dr. Marcus Wolf. Wolf realizes that the object is a comet on a collision course with Earth. Unfortunately, Wolf dies in a car accident on his way to alert the authorities.  One year later, [[MSNBC]] journalist Jenny Lerner investigates the sudden resignation of [[Secretary of the Treasury]] Alan Rittenhouse and his connection to "Ellie", supposedly a mistress. After interviewing Rittenhouse, she is taken by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to see President Tom Beck. Lerner realizes that Ellie is really an acronym: "E.L.E." ([[extinction event|"extinction-level event"]]). Due to Lerner's investigation, President Beck makes an announcement earlier than planned: the comet, named Wolf-Biederman, is headed for Earth. It is  long, large enough to cause a mass extinction, and possibly wipe out humanity. He also reveals that the United States and Russia have been constructing an [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Orion spacecraft]] called ''Messiah'' in orbit that will transport a team, led by Oren Monash and including veteran astronaut Spurgeon "Fish" Tanner, to the comet, hoping to alter its path with nuclear weapons.   After landing on the comet, the crew plant nuclear bombs beneath the surface, but are caught in outgassing explosions when sunlight heats up the comet. Monash is blinded by unfiltered sunlight and suffers severe facial burns, while Gus Partenza is flung into space by an outflow of gas. When the bombs detonate, the ship is damaged by the blast and the team loses contact with Earth. President Beck announces that the bombs only split the comet into two smaller pieces, nicknamed "Biederman" ( long) and "Wolf" ( long), both still heading for Earth.  Beck then imposes [[martial law]] and reveals that governments worldwide have been building underground shelters.

Dead Man on Campus
 Josh ([[Tom Everett Scott]]) gets into college on a scholarship, and Cooper ([[Mark-Paul Gosselaar]]) is assigned as his roommate. Cooper does little work and instead spends all the time partying and consistently fails his courses, but his father continues to pay his tuition. The normally studious Josh is led astray by Cooper's lifestyle, and spends the first half of his first semester partying instead of studying, and consequently flunks all of his midterms. To his horror, he then finds out that a condition of his scholarship is a passing grade average each semester, and that with his poor midterm score, he needs an A+++ (which is impossible) in all of his courses or he will lose his scholarship.   Meanwhile, Cooper's father finally realizes Cooper is not trying to pass his course at all, and threatens to pull his funding if he does not get a passing grade this semester, leaving him in a similar position. They find out about an obscure academic rule that states that if a student's roommate commits suicide, then the roommates get perfect grades for that semester, regardless of any previous academic standing. Cooper and Josh set out to find roommates who are likely to commit suicide; their first potential roommate, Cliff O'Malley ([[Lochlyn Munro]]), is more likely to get himself (and any one with him) killed than commit suicide. They soon realize that he will likely get them killed or arrested and jump out of his moving car when he is being chased by the police.  Next, they try Buckley Schrank (Randy Pearlstein), a computer geek who thinks [[Bill Gates]] wants his brain. After they move Buckley in, they try to help push him over the edge. First, Cooper poses as a suicide hotline volunteer, and when Buckley calls, he tells him that he is Bill Gates and wants his brain. Then, Cooper buys equipment that may assist in a suicide (rope, daggers, prescription drugs) and as Josh and he are trying to plant the items around the dorm room, Buckley discovers the pair hiding from him with a noose and knife in hand. Buckley, who thinks that they are trying to kill him, and that the conspiracy to kill him and steal his brain is real, runs away.   Finally, Josh and Cooper move in Matt Noonan ([[Corey Page]]), a moody rock musician. Later, Cooper catches him singing [[show tunes]] and learns he was voted Mr. Happy in high school, leading them to believe that he is only pretending to be depressed to impress girls and make a name for himself in music. Facing the loss of his scholarship, Josh stands on the edge of a bridge, about to commit suicide himself. Cooper tells Josh he is not a failure and talks him down. When Josh comes down from the bridge, he reveals to Cooper that he was faking his suicide attempt so the school would not fail him, and Cooper would look like a hero to his father. The film ends with Josh narrating that he was given an additional semester to improve his grades, in which he saved his scholarship, and that Cooper became a more serious student, but did work summers cleaning toilets for his father's business to learn how to eventually take over.

Deep Rising
 Amidst a storm, Finnegan and his crew, Joey and Leila, are hired by a group of [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] led by Hanover to pilot their boat across the [[South China Sea]] to an undisclosed location in the middle of the ocean. Meanwhile, the ''Argonautica'', a luxury [[cruise ship]] built and owned by Simon Canton, is undertaking its [[maiden voyage]] when a saboteur disables the ship's navigation and communication systems. A large object rises from beneath and collides with the vessel, leaving it dead in the water, while the panicking passengers are attacked by unseen creatures.  Finnegan's boat collides with a [[speedboat]] shaken loose during the collision, at which point the mercenaries take over and reveal they intend to rob the ''Argonautica'''s passengers and vault, before sinking the ship with [[torpedo]]es. The group boards the ship, leaving Leila and a mercenary named Billy, behind to repair the boat, where they are both killed by the same creature. The group reaches the ballroom only to find blood and no sign of the passengers. Finnegan and Joey go to the engine room to scavenge parts to repair the boat, under the guard of T-Ray and Mamooli who are both killed as well; as they are escaping they run into Trillian, a passenger who was imprisoned for stealing. Meanwhile Hanover's group reaches the vault and Vivo opens it only to be accidentally killed by Canton, who was hiding inside the vault along with Captain Atherton and three other passengers. They explain that the ship was attacked by unknown creatures that killed everyone else on board.  Under questioning, Canton is found to be responsible for the ship's sabotage, having hired the mercenaries to sink the unprofitable ship so that he could [[insurance fraud|collect on the insurance]]. The group is attacked by the creatures, consisting of giant spike-covered tentacles, which ate Captain Atherton. Canton theorizes that the creatures are an extreme evolution of the [[Ottoia]], which liquefy their victims and then eject the carcasses. With the rest of the mercenaries being killed, the survivors are herded towards the bow of ship, where they find a "feeding room" full of bloody skeletal remains. The creatures break through the hull, flooding the lower decks and separating the survivors. Hanover tries to sacrifice Joey to save himself, but instead gets eaten himself.  Finnegan and Joey spot an island from a distance and make it back to Finnegan's boat, but they have lost their engine parts, rendering it useless as a means of escape. They instead set the boat's [[autopilot]] to crash into the ''Argonautica'' and detonate the torpedoes. As Finnegan and Trillian find [[jet ski]]s they can use to reach the island, the tentacles smash through the main deck, revealed to be part of a single giant creature. Finnegan discovers Joey has gone missing, leaving him and Trillian to escape while being pursued by the creature. Canton jumps onto Finnegan's boat, but is unable to disable the autopilot. The boat crashes into the ''Argonautica'', destroying both ships and killing Canton and the creature.   Finnegan and Trillian reach the island and are reunited with Joey, who survived the ordeal and paddled ashore using Finnegan's [[surfboard]]. As the three relax, a loud roar echoes from the forest and something huge crashes toward them through the trees. As the camera pulls back, the island is revealed to be [[wikt:primordial|primordial]].

The Dentist 2
 Dr. Alan Feinstone is in the maximum security mental hospital he was sentenced to at the end of [[The Dentist|the first film]]. While talking to the psychiatrist, he remembers the murders he committed in his own mind, while convincing the doctor that it was another man who did those things. His remorseful story distracts her from seeing him pull a sharpened tool that he stitched into his own leg, and he uses her as a hostage to escape. Alan's wife Brooke is alive despite her missing tongue and inability to speak (she has since had new [[dental implant]]s put in to replace all the teeth that Alan pulled out in the first film). She hires an investigator to find out where Alan has escaped to, believing that he had been putting away money before he went crazy. Brooke has in her possession some postcards that Alan had left behind, and she believes he is in one of those places.  Alan winds up in the small town of [[Paradise, Missouri]], pretending that he had grown upset at life in the big city. He uses a previously established false identity of Dr. Lawrence Caine, and has a bank account where he had been sending the money he skimmed off from his practice to hide from the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]. The bank officer Mr. Wilkes introduces Alan to his niece Jamie, hoping that she can rent out her small cottage for "Larry" to live in so she could collect money from it.  Jamie, who physically resembles Brooke, becomes a target of Alan’s affections. When he has problems with a cap on one of his teeth, Alan visits the inept town dentist, Dr. Burns, whom he takes an instant disliking to. Alan threatens Dr. Burns with a [[golf club]], causing him to accidentally fall down the stairs to his death. Mr. Wilkes convinces Alan that he should take over as the new dentist for Paradise; Alan soon resumes his murderous ways with a passing tourist (Clint Howard) who accidentally recognizes him from [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].  As the private detective tracks Alan down to Paradise, Alan learns that Jamie has an admirer named Robbie, who also is the [[drywall]] contractor hired to finish his new office. Alan's jealousy causes him to ruin a romantic dinner when it is interrupted by a call from Robbie on her answering machine, despite Jamie's insistence that she only thinks of Robbie as a friend. Meanwhile, Beverley, a teller at the bank, has doubts about "Larry" and finds out his real identity while researching on the computer.  Beverley sets up an appointment to tell him she knows the truth, but when she asks too many questions he realizes that she knows something. He goes behind her and sedates her with nitrous oxide. She finds herself duct taped to the dental chair and cries and begs him to let her go. He puts a mouth clamp in her mouth to keep it open and drills her bottom-right molar tooth to the raw nerve as a "lie detector" to find out who else she has told. If she lied, he would take a dental hook and painfully wiggle the tooth he drilled. Robbie comes to install some more drywall, and after Beverley screams Robbie goes to check on her. In the ensuing fight, Alan kills Robbie with a hatchet, turns back to Beverley and re-tapes her to the dental chair. He takes a pair of dental pliers and plays a game of "truth or tooth". He asks her what did she tell Jeremy about Washington but he doesn't believe her then pulls out her left front tooth, then he asks her what she did tell Jamie. He then pulls her left [[incisor]] tooth out. Before finishing her off, Alan painfully extracts all of her teeth.  Later that night Alan begins to have his obsessive-compulsive visions of germs and decay again after seeing his blood-stained uniform. Suddenly Brooke appears, and begins to seduce him into one of his chairs; just before she can cut his tongue off with a pair of [[scissors]], Jamie knocks her out with an overhead lamp. However, as Jamie is calling the police about Brooke, she spots the bloody hatchet, and opens a closet door to find Robbie's and Beverley's maimed corpses.  Alan turns on Jamie and a fight ensues, with him chasing her to an upstairs bathroom and finally overpowering her. He takes her to an unfinished room in the office, which in his mind is spotless, germ-free and pure white, with opera music playing, and picks up an electric drill (which in his mind is a dental drill) and tries to drill her teeth. Jamie escapes and hides, until Brooke has revived and she and Jamie trap Alan in a hallway. Brooke lunges to stab him with a pair of scissors, but Jamie inadvertently hits her over the head with a 2x4, killing her.  Alan finds Jamie hiding behind some drywall, and after banter between the two, Jamie fires a [[nail gun]] repeatedly and hits him with numerous nails. Stunned, Alan walks downstairs into the midst of a surprise welcome party being given to him by the people of Paradise. Alan calmly exits out the front door, leaving the townpeople shocked and Jamie to recover from what just happened. Alan drives off into the night with numerous nails embedded in his head and shoulders. He begins to pull them out, using one as a toothpick for his cap which was lost in his fights with Jamie and Brooke, and maniacally laughs repeatedly.  
Dennis the Menace Strikes Again
 Some years after the previous film, Dennis Mitchell ([[Justin Cooper (actor)|Justin Cooper]]) is worse than ever. At the beginning of the film, he goes over to the house of George Wilson ([[Don Rickles]]) to offer him some pets as gifts for his birthday. These include frogs, lizards, snakes, insects, tarantulas, scorpions, mice, exotic mammals, and even a baby alligator. This ordeal ends with George unintentionally riding down a flight of stairs in Dennis's red wagon and accidentally getting his birthday cake thrown in his face by Martha ([[Betty White]]). Soon after this incident, Mr. Johnson, who is Dennis's grandfather as well as Alice's father and Henry's father-in law ([[George Kennedy]]), shows up and announces that he is moving in with the Mitchells. Dennis starts spending more time with him than his annoyed neighbor. George, upset that he's getting older, gets tricked by two crooked con men, the Professor and his assistant Sylvester ([[Brian Doyle-Murray]] and [[Carrot Top]]), who try to talk him into buying a "rare" root used to make tea to make people younger.   George is about to pay $10,000 when Dennis comes by. Dennis then reveals that he owns a root of the same kind, which he says he found on a place where those abound. Soon afterwards, the Professor and Sylvester return and sell George a machine that allegedly makes people younger. Suddenly, the attitudes of him and Mr. Johnson reverse as the latter feels George's pain of living in the same neighborhood as Dennis, while he starts to feel youthful and happy.   While Dennis is trying to clean up a pile of garbage that he accidentally threw on Grandpa's car while he was taking out the trash, he accidentally destroys Mr. Wilson's machine with cotton candy mix that he mistook for soap. As a result of this, George declares that he and Martha will be moving away to be away from Dennis for good, whereupon Mr. Johnson decides to move into their house, although no one seems to really want to carry out this plan. Overhearing everything, the Professor and Sylvester decides to use George's plan as an opportunity to get more money from him.  Dennis helps the police (unintentionally) catching the con men, who were pretending to be several different workmen at the Wilson house when they were planning to move, attempting yet again to drain his bank account by stockpiling a hoard of his as yet unendorsed checks by claiming that the house needed several repairs before it could be sold. Dennis, who was a "menace" throughout the whole film, ends up being a hero. The police return the uncashed checks, and Mr. Wilson decides not to move. Mr. Johnson, however, announces intentions to get his motor home back, having promised to take Dennis to the Grand Canyon, also because of everything Dennis has put him through.  The film ends as Dennis and his grandfather are in his camper in the Grand Canyon and Dennis, wanting to take a rock home to Mr. Wilson as a present, accidentally takes the one from under the camper, causing it to roll down the incline it is parked on top of with Mr. Johnson still in it. While enjoying the Christmas season, George and Martha see on the news what has happened as Dennis explains to the camera and Mr. Johnson is being airlifted to safety. Dennis gives a shoutout to Mr. Wilson, which leaves him flabbergasted that he mutters to the viewers "He's a menace!".

He starts asking a mysterious person. A strong gust of wind blows the shawl off the person, revealing it to be an enigmatic woman ([[Manisha Koirala]]). He finds her very attractive and tries to strike up a conversation, but she ignores him for a bit and then asks him for a cup of tea. When he returns with the tea, he sees her board the next train with three male passengers.  Later, Amar spots the same woman in [[Silchar]]. He attempts to talk to her, but she says she cannot recall meeting him before. As part of his news reporting assignment, for the occasion of fifty years of Indian [[Independence]], Amar interviews many citizens of [[Barak Valley]], and an extremist chief (Gautam Bora ), who claim that the reason behind human rights violations and poverty in the region is due to the Indian Government, and that the [[United Liberation Front of Assam|Liberationist]]s do not wish to enter into any dialogue with the government, and further justify their resistance in [[Northeast India|Utthar Purv]].  A few weeks later, Amar describes his encounter with the woman, over the radio, which she hears. He again spots her at a [[post office]] (It is later revealed that she is corresponding to her terrorist group in New Delhi, planning a suicide attack.) At this juncture, she tells him to leave her; but he follows her to the house and tells her that he is in love with her, but she resists and tells Amar that she is married. Amar wishes to apologise to her, but she arrives with two men (who Amar believes are her brothers) who beat him unconscious.  During the beating, Amar learns that the men are presumably her brothers and that she had lied about her being married. He reaches her home, and learns from the locals that she has left the place. Amar then goes to the post office where he initially spotted her and bribes the PCO owner into giving him her contact details, and learns that she is telephoning to [[Ladakh]]. Subsequently, Amar travels to [[Leh]], and while recording the [[Sindhu Darshan Festival]], a suicide bomber is chased to death by the military, and Amar spots the woman again. (It is later revealed that the woman is associated with him). The woman boards the bus, and while Amar claims to the military, that he is here reporting on the festival, the woman uses Amar to her advantage, purporting in front of the military personnel that she is with her husband.  The bus takes off. After some travel, the bus breaks down and the passengers are required to walk to the nearby village. En route Amar forces the woman to reveal her name: Meghna ([[Manisha Koirala]]). The two end up travelling together and recuperate. Next day, Amar wakes to find Meghna gone (It is later revealed that Meghna is part of a [[United Liberation Front of Assam|Liberationist]]s group which plans multiple [[suicide attack]]s in New Delhi at the upcoming [[Republic Day]] celebration).  Amar returns to his home in Delhi, where his family has found in Preeti Nair ([[Preity Zinta]]) from [[Kerala]], a potential bride for him. Amar agrees to marry Preeti because he does not hope to meet Meghna again. On his date with Preeti, Amar spots one of Meghna's associates, Kim, who banished him earlier. Amar chases him down to [[Connaught Place, New Delhi|Connaught Place]], where the man kills himself with cyanide, and the police relinquish the situation to the [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]].  Much to Amar's surprise, Meghna is in Delhi with her group, and requests Amar to help her get an employment as an office assistant at Amar's All India Radio office. (It is later revealed that Meghna actually arrives to Delhi along with her terrorist group and stays in Amar's residence to escape from the [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] inquiry operation). Based on eyewitness claims of the Connaught Place incident, Amar is now a prime suspect of the CBI ([[Piyush Mishra]]). At this juncture Amar follows Meghna and questions her motives, and she reveals to Amar, that her name is actually Moina, and as a child, she had been [[Kunan Poshpora incident|a rape victim of the army]] and seeks liberation through her [[suicide attack]] on the Indian army and the President of India during the [[Republic Day]]. Now the CBI convinces the [[Army general]] of India to grant permission to conduct security checks of all the Army [[convoy]]s and tankers participating in the parade.  Amar is again assaulted by Moina's associate ([[Aditya Srivastava]]) and the terrorists and as Amar fights back the terrorists receive a call from Moina on their mobile. Amar grabs the mobile and pleads Moina to stop all this and marry him. Moina reveals that it is too late, and presumes Amar is being killed. But Amar returns home, only to find out from Preeti that Amar's mother is also being questioned and that Moina's location is at Sunder Nagar. The CBI also misconstrue that Amar is part of the terrorist group and arrest him.  Amar claims to the CBI that he is not in cahoots with the terrorists, but in love with Moina and that he has interviewed one of the extremist leaders and wants to prevent them from perpetrating the attack. The CBI rejects Amar's claims and sedates him for further interrogation. The next day Moina is ready for the suicide attack. Amar escapes from the CBI and tries to hold Moina back. Amar expresses his love and desire to be with her, embraces her and pleads her to live with him. As they embrace, the explosive vest worn by Moina explodes, killing them both.

He solicits Pignon's assistance in making a series of telephone calls to locate his wife, but Pignon gaffes each time, including revealing the existence of Brochant's mistress, Marlene Sasseur (thinking that she is Brochant's sister, since her name sounds like "sa soeur"), to his wife Christine and inviting tax inspector Lucien Cheval to Brochant's house where Brochant is forced to quickly hide most of his valuables in an attempt to disguise his tax evasion.

Disturbing Behavior
  Steve Clark ([[James Marsden]]) is a high school senior whose family moves to Cradle Bay, a picturesque island community in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state's [[Puget Sound]]. It has been nearly one year since Steve's older brother, Allen ([[Ethan Embry]]), committed suicide, which traumatized the family.  During Steve's first day at his new high school, he meets and befriends three outcast students, Gavin Strick ([[Nick Stahl]]), Gavin's friend, U.V. ([[Chad Donella]]) and Rachel "Rae" Wagner ([[Katie Holmes]]). Gavin tries to tell Steve that he believes there is something evil about the "Blue Ribbons" - a clique of students taking part in a "special program" led by the school psychologist, Dr. Edgar Caldicott ([[Bruce Greenwood]]). Later that day, Steve witnesses a fight in class between a rebellious student, Dickie Atkinson ([[Tygh Runyan]]) and one of the Blue Ribbons. Dickey is later accosted at a secluded marina by the Blue Ribbons. He later reappears at school as a clean-cut Blue Ribbon and assists in smashing his once-prized muscle car up in front of the students.  Steve goes to a local yogurt shop to meet Gavin, but the Blue Ribbons, keen to befriend him, invite him to sit with them. Gavin arrives to meet Steve, and takes him outside after a tense exchange with the group. Gavin shows Steve a photograph of himself and several of his friends, who were transformed into Blue Ribbons. The two eavesdrop on a parents meeting, where Gavin learns his parents have signed him up for Caldicott's program. Steve remains skeptical of Gavin's fears of the Blue Ribbons and the program, and wrestles a gun Gavin produces, which he planned to use against his expected abductors.  The following day at lunch, Gavin walks in with his hair cut, and looking like a Blue Ribbon. When Steve tries to confront Gavin, he gets punched in the stomach for his impertinence. Later, after being chased home, Steve finds Blue Ribbon member Lorna Longley (Crystal Cass) in his living room, waiting up after tutoring Steve's younger sister Lindsay ([[Katharine Isabelle]]). She goes to use the bathroom, then emerges, partially undressed, and forcefully kisses Steve. Her heightened arousal causes her right eye to glow red, startling Steve.  Lorna then starts saying: "Wrong, bad!" and then smashes her head into a mirror, attacks Steve with a mirror shard, and then leaves the house. She is later seen undergoing treatment at a medical facility under Dr. Caldicott's direction. He insists to Lorna's parents that the [[Brain implant]] where the pituitary gland and right eye are works, and she needed a new one.  During this time, Steve also befriends Dorian ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]), the school janitor, who appears to be mentally disabled and hunts rats for the city for some extra cash. Dorian demonstrates a device called an E-Rat-icator which emits a soft, high pitched whine that is supposed to be innocuous but annoying to rats. Dorian tells Steve that he suspects that the entire community of Cradle Bay is part of a massive conspiracy made up of nearly all of the parents, the local police chief, the school principal and entire school faculty, who hired Dr. Caldicott to "reprogram" their own children to become the perfect people that they want them to be and not rebellious teenagers.  Rachel finds a [[CD-R]] disc that Gavin hid in the school's boiler room, containing a video he made of himself before his "transformation", telling about the history of the club and Caldicott's background. A Blue Ribbon known as "Chug" ([[A.J. Buckley]]) assaults Rachel in the basement, when Dorian's E-Rat-icator goes off, and immediately sends Chug into an agonized frenzy, during which Rachel slips away.  Chug smashes the E-Rat-cator and walks out, apparently oblivious to what has just occurred.  During their personal investigation, Steve and Rachel try to find out what exactly has been happening to the Blue Ribbon kids, which leads them to a mental hospital called Bishop Flats following a lead on the disc. They find out that mind control is being used to make unruly teens become perfect so they can function properly in life, but the programming has some glitches that lead to momentary relapses and violent fits. They also find Caldicott's own daughter, Betty (Julie Patzwald), a failed project who appears to have been lobotomized by her father's experiments.  After escaping from the hospital, Steve and Rachel return to Cradle Bay to plan to rescue Lindsay and Gavin's friend, U.V. before fleeing town. They have a run-in with the town's police chief Cox ([[Steve Railsback]]) who is also involved in the conspiracy.  He tries to arrest them for being out after curfew, but Dorian shows up under the pretense that he is disposing of dead rats, then knocks out the police chief and frees Steve and Rachel, telling them to leave town and go public with what they know. When Rachel and Steve return to Steve's home to get Lindsay, Steve's parents reveal that they moved to Cradle Bay to sign him up for the program. A group of Blue Ribbons ambush them and drag Steve and Rachel to the programming center.  Steve grabs a scalpel before being strapped into a chair.  Before the reprogramming can start, Steve uses the scalpel to cut his bonds and rescue Rachel, and killing the medical techs. On the way out, they fight and kill Chug, who has been left behind to guard them.  Exiting what turns out to be the town hospital's basement, Steve and Rachel are met by Lindsay and U.V. in Rachel's truck. Rushing to catch the early ferry, they meet with a roadblock made of Blue Ribbons and Caldicott on the road. When hope seems lost, Dorian drives up, striking Caldicott, and activating multiple E-Rat-icators that scramble the mind control tech inside the Blue Ribbons' heads. They chase after Dorian and try to destroy the E-Rat-icators.  Dorian, having been fatally wounded by a gunshot from Caldicott, and believing the Blue Ribbons to be beyond help, drives his car off a cliff with most of the Blue Ribbons hanging onto it. A final battle ensues between Steve and Caldicott, which Steve wins by kicking Caldicott off the cliff. Steve and Rachel then leave Cradle Bay on the ferry with Lindsay and U.V. to begin a new life without their parents facing an uncertain future, but free.  The final scene shows a classroom in an urban high school with kids playing loud music, cursing, and acting up. They are informed that they have a new student teacher. The well-groomed teacher turns around after writing on the board and is revealed to be Gavin, with the Blue Ribbon "red twinkle" still active in his right eye.

Through all this, John begins learning to re-appreciate his gift, at one point confiding to Lucky that he has never felt excited about his work in years. However, Lisa and Mark catch him performing CPR on a [[rat]], and have him institutionalized.  Believing his gift is a hindrance, John rejects all abnormality in his life and returns to work, but in doing so, ostracizes Maya as well, who comes to believe he doesn’t like her. Maya admits to Archer that she liked the idea of her father talking to animals. John eavesdrops on the conversation and has a change of heart. John admits to Maya that he does like her for who she is, and encourages her to continue being what she wants to be. John then apologizes to Lucky, and together, they steal Jake from the circus to perform surgery on him. Mark and Gene catch John, but Gene tires of the former’s opportunistic attitude and helps John. When Jake is exposed to the party for the buyout, John calmly goes on with the operation. Archer reveals to Lisa that John's gift is real, encouraging her to venture into the operating theatre and keep Jake calm whilst her husband and Gene remove the cause of Jake’s pain, saving Jake's life.  Calloway is impressed with John's talent, but he declines the deal. John becomes both a doctor and a veterinarian, embracing his ability to talk to animals. In the film's final scenes, Maya's egg hatches, but is revealed to be a baby [[alligator]], and John and Lucky are shown walking to the circus and talking with each other.

Meanwhile, a drowned Nobita is rescued by a dolphin and taken to an island where Betty's younger brother, Jack lives. Although Nobita is unable to converse with Jack due to a language barrier, the two befriend and Nobita learns the dolphin's name, Ruffin, as well as the fact that Jack is also separated from his family, like himself. The pirate company eventually arrives at the island and begins searching for Nobita and Jack. One by one, the pirates and Doraemon's company are attacked and captured by the island's inhabitants, which Doraemon notes as being uncannily similar to a pirate simulator created in the 22nd century.

The sea monster crashes into the walls of the cave which contains the facility, effectively flooding it as well as the rest of the island.  As the island starts sinking, the company escapes from the island with the help of Ruffin and its other dolphin friends. Cash is arrested by the Future Time Patrols summoned by Ruffin, who is revealed to be a secret agent of them who was sent to bust out Cash and his associates. The pirates, having recovered their leader, Betty and Jack's father, are now rich as they have found the secret treasures on the island.

The Dreamlife of Angels
 The film is about two [[working class]] women, Isa and Marie. Isa is a drifter and searching for a lover she had met during the summer. When she realizes that her search for him is futile and turns elsewhere, she meets Marie, who lives in a small French town near [[Lille]]. The two young women instantly find a connection as they both have been treated harshly by life and are living from day to day in short-time jobs, such as working in a [[textile]] factory or delivering leaflets in the streets. Marie lives in an apartment that she is looking after because the owners had a car accident in which everyone died, except for Sandrine, a teenager, who is in a [[coma]]. Marie invites Isa to live with her. Shortly thereafter Isa and Marie meet up with two bouncers, Fredo and Charly, whom they befriend. The men help them out and they have genuine fun together, although they are not much better off than the women.  Isa is the kind of girl who always lands on her own two feet and has a casual [[wiktionary:c'est la vie|c'est la vie]] attitude when it comes to life and generally doesn't let the hardships get to her, while Marie finds it hard to express herself emotionally, and gets angry when she feels vulnerable. Marie cannot put up with the way she is tossed around by the world, and so, despite being in a relationship with Charly, she tries to escape through a local playboy, Chriss, a rich nightclub owner, who regularly goes out with girls and views Marie as just another one of his random flings. Isa is tougher in that she can take the beating and stick with what is around her, and does not get carried away by the false possibility of a better life. Significantly, Isa refuses to sleep with her casual boyfriend Fredo, drawing her strength from within, while Marie is emotionally dependent on Chriss, who, it is clear, does not love her. Isa is well aware of Chriss's true intentions and tries to warn Marie, who refuses to listen.  Isa finds Sandrine's diary and reads it to her during visits in the hospital. Meanwhile, Chriss decides to end his fling with Marie. Instead of breaking up with her in person, he asks Isa to tell her for him (she replies "it's not for me to tell her"), clearly afraid Marie would self-destruct in front of him, then leaving Marie's later calls unreturned. Meanwhile, Sandrine comes out of her coma, but Isa, who has visited her so faithfully while she was in a coma, decides not to see her while she is awake. After finally learning about Chriss' decision to end the relationship, Marie jumps out of a window. The film ends with Isa starting to work in a new factory.

Mary's [[Protestantism|Protestant]] half-sister, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], under house arrest for conspiracy charges, is freed and crowned the Queen of England.  As briefed by her adviser [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], Elizabeth inherits a distressed England besieged by debts, crumbling infrastructure, hostile neighbours and treasonous nobles within her administration, chief among them the [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]]. Cecil advises Elizabeth to marry, produce an heir, and secure her rule. Unimpressed with her suitors, Elizabeth delays her decision and continues her secret affair with [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Lord Robert Dudley]] while Cecil appoints [[Francis Walsingham]], a Protestant exile returned from France, to act as Elizabeth's bodyguard and adviser.  [[Mary of Guise]] lands an additional 4,000 French troops in neighbouring [[Scotland]]. Unfamiliar with military strategy and browbeaten by Norfolk at the war council, Elizabeth orders a military response, which proves disastrous when the younger, ill-trained English forces are defeated by the professional French soldiers. Walsingham tells Elizabeth that Catholic lords and priests intentionally deprived Elizabeth's army of proper soldiers and used their defeat to argue for Elizabeth's removal. Realizing the depth of the conspiracy against her and her dwindling options, Elizabeth accepts Mary of Guise's conditions, to consider marrying her nephew [[Henry III of France|Henry of France]].  To stabilize her rule and heal England's religious divisions, Elizabeth proposes the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement|Act of Uniformity]], which unites English Christians under the [[Church of England]] and severs their connection to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. In response to the Act's passage, the Vatican sends a [[John Ballard (Jesuit)|priest]] to England to aid Norfolk and his cohorts in their growing plot to overthrow Elizabeth. Unaware of the plot, Elizabeth meets Henry of France but ignores his advances in favour of Lord Robert. William Cecil confronts Elizabeth over her indecisiveness about marrying and reveals Lord Robert is married to another woman. Elizabeth rejects Henry's marriage proposal when she discovers he is a [[cross-dresser]] and confronts Lord Robert about his secrets, fracturing their idyllic affair and banishing him from her private residence.  Elizabeth survives an assassination attempt, whose evidence implicates Mary of Guise. Elizabeth sends Walsingham to secretly meet with Mary in Scotland, under the guise of once again planning to marry Henry. Instead, Walsingham assassinates Guise, inciting French enmity against Elizabeth. When William Cecil orders her to solidify relations with the Spanish, Elizabeth dismisses him from her service, choosing instead to follow her own counsel.  Walsingham warns of another plot to kill Elizabeth spearheaded by the priest from [[Rome]] carrying letters of conspiracy. Under Elizabeth's orders, Walsingham apprehends the priest who divulges the names of the conspirators and a Vatican agreement to elevate Norfolk to the English crown if he weds [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. Walsingham arrests Norfolk and executes him and every conspirator except Lord Robert.  Elizabeth grants Lord Robert his life as a reminder to herself to never be blinded by romance again.  Drawing inspiration from the divine, Elizabeth cuts her hair and models her appearance after the [[Virgin Mary]].

While at a party with Maggie, several guys from their school call Eric gay slurs that cause him to leave.  Later that night, Eric ventures out to the local gay disco "The Universal", a hopping joint run by none other than his old boss, Angie, who tells him not to worry about what everyone else thinks. He dances with a guy who takes him out to his car where the guy gives Eric a rim job, but then leaves shortly afterwards. Stung by a meaningless sexual experience, he calls Rod, who at first seems happy to hear from him, but then tells Eric that he probably shouldn't call him anymore. Eric then goes to Maggie's house where he finally tells her that he is gay. Maggie does not seem to be that surprised since she suspected Eric's relationship with Rod, but she comforts him nevertheless. Eric starts visiting the bar frequently, where he feels accepted by Angie and her close circle of friends.

When Eric goes home, he is ambushed by his mother, Bonnie, about his recent behavior and appearance, and says that people are getting the wrong idea about him. Eric leaves, and goes to see Angie. While at her house, Angie explains to Eric that it's difficult to accept yourself for who you really are, and that he should give himself some time. He reconciles with Maggie, but quickly realizes that it was a mistake after sleeping together. Crestfallen at his rejection and his willingness to toy with her affections, Maggie ends the friendship. After she leaves, Eric's mother confronts him about a pair of matches she found in his clothes that were from the bar. He quickly denies ever going to the Universal, and leaves. When Eric finally comes home, he finds his mother playing on the piano. He comes out to her; feeling a weight being lifted off his shoulders.

 NSA official Thomas Bryan Reynolds meets with U.S. Congressman Phil Hammersley in a public park to discuss support for a new piece of [[counter-terrorism]] legislation the [[U.S. Congress]] is pushing that dramatically expands the [[surveillance]] powers of intelligence agencies over individuals and groups. Hammersley remains committed to blocking its passage, since he believes it would almost totally destroy the privacy of American citizens. Reynolds, determined to have the bill pass so as to gain a long-delayed and anticipated promotion within the NSA, has his team murder Hammersley, spread heart pills over his car, place him in the car and push it in a lake to make it look like he had a heart attack. In the aftermath, they discover that wildlife researcher Daniel Zavits had a camera aimed in the woods at their location. Zavits inspects the footage and, realizing he has captured the congressman's murder, calls a journalist he knows. The call is monitored by Reynolds's team who attempt to break into Zavits' apartment to retrieve the tape. Realizing he is in danger, Zavits transfers the video to a disc before fleeing the apartment ahead of Reynolds's men.  Zavits bumps into an old college friend, labor lawyer Robert Clayton Dean, and slips the disc into his shopping bag without his knowledge. Shortly after, Zavits is killed when he collides with a fire truck on a stolen bicycle. When the NSA discovers that Dean might have the video, Reynolds's team raids his house and plants surveillance devices. They then disseminate false evidence to implicate Dean of working with the mob family of Paulie Pintero and having an affair with ex-girlfriend Rachel Banks. The subterfuge destroys Dean's life: he is dismissed from his job, his bank accounts are frozen, and his wife Carla throws him out of the house.  Dean believes Pintero is behind the [[smear campaign]] as revenge for a prior case, with help from Banks' secretive contact Brill. Dean sets up a meet with Brill, to which the NSA sends an impostor, but the real Brill rescues Dean. Brill explains that his pursuers are NSA agents and rids him of tracking devices hidden in his clothing. With Dean and Brill in hiding, the NSA agents kill Banks and frame Dean for the murder.  Dean obtains the disc and Brill identifies Reynolds in the recovered video, but the disc is destroyed during an escape from an NSA raid. Brill, whose real name is Edward Lyle, tells Dean of his past as a communications expert; he was stationed in Iran during the [[Iranian Revolution]]; his partner, Rachel's father, was killed, but Lyle made it out and has been in hiding since. Lyle tries to coax Dean into running away, but Dean is adamant about clearing his name.  Dean and Lyle trail another supporter of the surveillance bill, U.S. Congressman Sam Albert, videotaping him having an affair with his aide. Dean and Lyle "hide" one of the NSA's bugs in Albert's room so Albert will find it and have the NSA start an investigation into Albert's tapping. Lyle also deposits money into Reynolds's bank account to make it appear that he is taking bribes, putting pressure on Reynolds.  Lyle contacts Reynolds to set up a meeting to exchange the video and get Reynolds to incriminate himself. Reynolds' men instead ambush the meeting and hold Lyle and Dean at gunpoint, demanding the tape. Dean tells them that the Hammersley murder footage is in the hands of Pintero, knowing Pintero's restaurant is under [[FBI]] surveillance. Dean, Reynolds, and the NSA team head into Pintero's restaurant. Using ambiguous language, Dean convinces Pintero that Reynolds is after the incriminating video Dean blackmailed him with and the encounter turns into a massive gunfight that kills the mobsters, Reynolds, and several of his NSA team. Lyle escapes while the FBI rescues Dean and uncovers the entire conspiracy.  The U.S. Congress is forced to abandon the bill to avoid a national scandal, though they cover up the NSA's involvement to preserve the agency's reputation. Dean is cleared of all charges and is reunited with his wife. Lyle leaves Dean a "goodbye" message via his TV as he's watching, showing himself relaxing in a tropical location.

Her grandmother warns her never to go there again, because it was a cursed area. She narrates the legend behind it. Years ago, that area was once occupied by a newly wed  Namboothiri couple. The wife, Kunjathol, later found out that her husband was a womanizer. When she objected, her husband murdered her. Since then, Kunjathol, now a [[Yakshini|Yakshi]], is believed to be haunting that place, along with her associate Karineeli, another Yakshi, intent on killing anyone and drinking their blood who passed that very area. To prove this story true, her grandmother narrated another story. Once, two men lost their way while attending a nearby festival. A young woman then came up to them and asked them if they could give her a few [[Betel|betel leaves]] to chew. To their horror, it was none other than Kunjathol herself, who then killed them and drank their blood.  One day, Janakikutty happenes to come across Bhaskaran and her cousin Sarojini (Rashmi Soman), who are actually having an affair. This upsets her and she runs home in tears, but in between, sprains her leg and falls to the ground. Suddenly, a voice calls out her name. She encounters Kunjathol (Chanchal), who comes to her with a smile and introduces herself and Karineeli. She also says that since Janakikutty didn't commit any sin, she would instead like to befriend her and protect her.  Since then, Janakikutty and Kunjathol become the best friends, where Kunjathol helped Janakikutty whenever she needed.  In the meantime, Janakikutty's family is worried over her strange behavior. Occasionally, they would see her conversing with herself or talk rudely to elders. At the same time, an unseen force vandalizes the household. They believe that the ghost of Kunjathol must be haunting them. They conduct a number of rituals but to no avail.   Later, Sarojini's marriage is to be conducted. However, she is against it because she already loved someone else. Janakikutty decides to help her with Kunjathol's aid. However, when Janakikutty approached Kunjathol, she initially refuses. Nevertheless, on Janakikutty's request, she agrees. But when she tries to execute the plan as told by Janakikutty, she instead transforms into a fierce, [[Vampire|vampiric]] form, frightening Janakikutty, who then faints. Understanding the magnitude of the situation, her family decide to give her medical attention.  Kunjathol sees Janakikutty for one last time and then bids her goodbye. At this point, Bhaskaran is now completely aware of Janakikutty's feelings towards him and accepts her as his true love.

The Faculty
 One evening at Herrington High School in [[Ohio]], several teachers and Principal Drake leave after discussing the school's budget. When Drake returns to retrieve her keys, Coach Willis becomes increasingly erratic and stabs a pencil through Drake's hand when she attempts to leave. Drama teacher Mrs. Olson emotionlessly stabs Drake with scissors as she flees the school.  The following morning, the students arrive, including Casey Connor, the dedicated but perpetually harassed photographer for the school newspaper. Casey is the unappreciated assistant to spiteful Delilah Profitt, the paper's editor-in-chief and head cheerleader. Delilah's mistreated boyfriend Stan Rosado is contemplating quitting the football team to pursue academics. Zeke Tyler is an intelligent yet rebellious student repeating his senior year. Tyler sells, among other illegal items, a powdery [[MDMA|ecstasy]]-like drug he manufactures and distributes; he is confronted by Miss Elizabeth Burke, who expresses concern for him over his illegal activities. Naive transfer student Marybeth Louise Hutchinson befriends self-styled outcast Stokely Mitchell, who has deliberately spread rumors that she is a lesbian though she has a crush on Stan. Marybeth develops a crush on Zeke.  Casey notices a strange creature on the football field and takes it to science teacher Mr. Furlong, who believes it is a new species of [[cephalopod]]-specific parasite called a [[mesozoan]]. Delilah and Casey hide in the teachers' lounge to find a story. They witness Coach Willis and Ms. Olson forcing one of the creatures into the ear of school nurse Ms. Harper. They also find the body of Mrs. Brummel. Casey and Delilah flee, and Casey calls the police. Principal Drake claims nothing is wrong and Casey is seeking attention.  The next day, Casey tells Delilah, Stan, and Stokely he believes the teachers are being controlled by aliens. After Zeke and Marybeth tease them about their theory, Mr. Furlong confronts them. Furlong suddenly becomes defensive and attempts to infect them. Zeke cuts off Furlong's fingers, which keep moving on their own, and injects his homemade drugs into Furlong's eye, apparently killing him. Zeke takes the five to his house, where he experiments on a specimen retrieved by Casey. He discovers it needs water to survive and can be killed by his drugs. Zeke makes everyone take his drug to prove they are uninfected humans. Delilah is revealed as infected, and she destroys Zeke's lab and most of his drug supply before escaping.  Acting on Stokely's speculation that killing the alien queen will revert everyone to normal, the group returns to the school, where their football team is playing and infecting opposing players. Believing Principal Drake to be the queen, they isolate her in the gym and fatally shoot her. Stan confronts the coach and team to see if the plan worked, but becomes infected himself. Zeke and Casey retrieve more of Zeke's drugs from his car. Casey leads infected students away from Zeke, who encounters Miss Burke in the parking lot and seemingly kills her while escaping.  At the gym, Stokely becomes suspicious of Marybeth during a conversation about pretending to be what one is not. Marybeth subsequently reveals herself to be the alien queen; earlier on, she faked taking the drug. Casey and Stokely flee to the swimming pool, where Stokely is injured and becomes infected. Zeke and Casey hide in the locker room, where Marybeth reverts to her human disguise. She explains she is taking over Earth because her own planet is dying. Marybeth transforms back into her true form and hurls Zeke across the room into the lockers, knocking him out. Casey seizes the drug and tricks the queen into following him into the retracting bleachers, trapping her. He stabs the drug into the queen's eye. The queen infects Casey with her dying breath, but he almost immediately returns to normal upon her death. Casey returns to the locker room and finds Stokely and Zeke alive.  One month later, everyone has returned to normal. Stan and Stokely, who has shed her Goth girl image, begin dating, and Zeke takes Stan's place on the football team (while Miss Burke affectionately watches him practice). Mr. Furlong has miraculously survived the attack, now sporting an eyepatch and bandages on his hand. Casey begins dating Delilah, who is no longer vindictive, and is considered a local hero as verious newspapers reveal the attempted alien invasion is now public knowledge.  
Fallen (1998 film)
 An opening voiceover announces that this is the story of "how I almost died".  [[Philadelphia Police Department|Philadelphia Police]] Detective John Hobbes visits [[serial killer]] Edgar Reese, whom he helped capture, on death row.  Reese grabs Hobbes' hand and says something in an unknown language, later identified as [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. As he is [[Capital punishment|executed]] in the [[gas chamber]], Reese sings "[[Time Is on My Side|Time is on My Side]]" by the [[Rolling Stones]].   Hobbes and his partner Jonesy investigate a string of murders by an apparent [[Copycat crimes|copycat killer]]. Hobbes, through hints given initially by Reese, and later by the apparent copycat killer, tracks down a woman named Gretta Milano. Gretta explains that her father, a former detective, killed himself after being accused of a series of demonic-themed murders similar to the current ones. Hobbes goes to the Milano family's lake-house, and finds books concerning demonic possession. He also discovers the name "[[Azazel]]" written on a wall.  When Hobbes mentions the name to Gretta, she gravely advises him to drop the case to protect his life and family. However, she reconsiders after a terrifying encounter with a man on the street. Gretta explains to Hobbes that Azazel is a fallen angel with the power to possess human beings by touch. Hobbes realises that Azazel, while possessing Edgar Reese, touched Hobbes before the execution, but was not able to possess him. Gretta explains that the demon will try to ruin his life by another way, and warns him of the inevitability of Azazel's victory. Azazel finds Hobbes at his precinct and taunts him while jumping from body to body, singing "Time is on My Side." Hobbes counters that he knows of Azazel's true identity, to which the demon responds, "Beware my wrath", and disappears.  To provoke Hobbes, Azazel possesses his nephew Sam and attacks John's [[intellectually disabled]] brother Art in their home. He flees into other people on the street, ending up in a schoolteacher. As the teacher, Azazel draws a gun and forces Hobbes to shoot his host in front of a group of bystanders. Azazel boasts to Hobbes that even if his current host body is killed, he can transfer to any new host body in the surrounding area, without even needing to touch them.    Lieutenant Stanton informs Hobbes that his fingerprints were found at one of the murder scenes and along with the bizarre circumstances of the shooting of the teacher Azazel possessed, he has become a suspect for all the murders. Azazel inhabits several of the witnesses and gives false accounts that the shooting was unprovoked, throwing further suspicion on Hobbes. He also comes into his home and murders his brother, whilst also marking Sam. Hobbes then takes his nephew to Gretta's house, to keep him safe. Gretta explains that, if forced out of a host body, Azazel can only travel in spirit form for as long as one breath can sustain him; if he does not possess another host in time, he will die permanently.  Hobbes goes to the Milano's cabin and calls Jonesy, knowing he will trace the call. Stanton and Jonesy show up to arrest Hobbes; however, Jonesy reveals himself to be possessed by Azazel and kills Stanton. Azazel prepares to shoot himself, which will allow him to possess Hobbes, the only other person for miles. Hobbes attacks Jonesy and in the ensuing struggle manages to shoot and mortally wound him. Hobbes explains that he has poisoned himself, which will leave Azazel without a host, before shooting and killing Jonesy. Azazel takes possession of Hobbes' body and frantically attempts to flee, but succumbs to the poison and dies. Hobbes, in voiceover, reminds the viewer this is the story of how he ''almost'' died, revealing that he is really Azazel. A cat, who has been possessed by Azazel, emerges from underneath the cabin and begins heading back to civilization.  
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)
 In 1971, [[Raoul Duke]] and [[Oscar Zeta Acosta|Dr. Gonzo]] speed across the Nevada desert. Duke, under the influence of mescaline, complains of a swarm of giant bats, before going through the pair's inventory of psychoactive drugs. Shortly afterward, the duo stop to pick up a young hitchhiker, and explain what they are doing. Duke has been assigned by an unnamed magazine to travel to Las Vegas and cover the [[Mint 400]] motorcycle race. However, they have also decided to take advantage of the trip by purchasing a large number of drugs and renting a red Chevrolet Impala convertible. The young man soon becomes terrified of the antics of the duo and flees on foot. Trying to reach Vegas before the hitchhiker can go to the police, Gonzo gives Duke part of a sheet of Sunshine Acid, then informs him that there is little chance of making it before the drug kicks in. By the time they reach the strip, Duke is in the full throes of his trip, and barely makes it through the check-in, all the while hallucinating that the hotel clerk is a moray eel, and that his fellow bar patrons are lizards in the depths of an orgy.  The next day, Duke arrives at the race, and heads out with his photographer, a man by the name of Lacerda. During the coverage, Duke becomes irrational and believes that they are in the middle of a battlefield, so he fires Lacerda and returns to the hotel. After consuming more mescaline, as well as huffing [[diethyl ether]], Duke and Gonzo arrive at the [[Circus Circus Las Vegas|Bazooko Circus]] casino, but leave shortly afterwards, the chaotic atmosphere frightening Gonzo. Back in the hotel room, Duke leaves Gonzo unattended, and tries his luck at a quick round of [[Big Six wheel|Big Six]]. When Duke returns, he finds that Gonzo, after consuming a full sheet of LSD, has trashed the room, and is sitting fully clothed in the bathtub, attempting to pull the tape player in with him, as he wants to hear the song better. He pleads with Duke to throw the machine into the water when the song "[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]" peaks. Duke agrees, but instead throws a grapefruit at Gonzo's head before running outside.  The next morning, Duke awakens to an exorbitant room service bill, and no sign of Gonzo (who has returned to Los Angeles while Duke slept), and attempts to leave town. As he nears [[Baker, California]], a highway patrolman pulls him over for speeding, and advises him to sleep at a nearby rest stop. Duke instead heads to a payphone and calls Gonzo, learning that he has a suite in his name at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas]] so he can cover a district attorney's convention on narcotics. Duke checks into his suite, only to be met by an LSD-tripping Gonzo, and a young girl by the name of Lucy he has brought with him. Gonzo explains that Lucy has come to Las Vegas to meet [[Barbra Streisand]], and that he gave her LSD on the plane not realizing she had never taken it before. Sensing the trouble this could get them into, Duke convinces Gonzo to ditch Lucy in another hotel before her trip wears off.  Gonzo accompanies Duke to the D.A.'s convention, and the pair discreetly snort cocaine as the guest speaker delivers a comically out-of-touch speech about "marijuana addicts" before showing a brief film. Unable to take it, Duke and Gonzo flee back to their room, only to discover that Lucy has called. Their trips mostly over, Gonzo deals with Lucy over the phone (pretending that he is being savagely beaten by thugs), as Duke attempts to mellow out by trying some of Gonzo's stash of [[adrenochrome]]. However, the trip spirals out of control, and Duke is reduced to an incoherent mess before he blacks out.  After an unspecified amount of time passes, Duke wakes up to a complete ruin of the once pristine suite. After discovering his tape recorder, he attempts to remember what has happened. As he listens, he has brief memories of the general mayhem that has taken place, including a heated encounter with a waitress at a [[diner]], convincing a distraught cleaning woman that they are police officers investigating a drug ring, and attempting to buy an [[orangutan]].  Duke drops Gonzo off at the airport, after missing the entrance, driving across the tarmac and pulling up right next to the plane, before returning to the hotel one last time to finish his article. Duke then speeds back to Los Angeles.  
Fatal Deviation
 ''Fatal Deviation'' tells the story of Jimmy Bennett, a disenfranchised young man trying to rebuild his life. On returning home after a ten year stay in St. Claude's Reform School, he aims to discover who he is, what it is he should do and what happened to his father. Shortly after his return to his hometown, Jimmy gets on the wrong side of a local gang, beating up two of its members who had been harassing local shop worker Nicola, in an attempt to force her to date gang member Mikey (played by [[Mikey Graham]] of [[Boyzone]] fame). The fight is witnessed by a monk in a local secret kung-fu group, with mysterious links to Jimmy's father. This order organises the [[Bealtaine]] tournament, an underground 'no-rules' fighting tournament, in which Jimmy is invited to partake.  The gang leader, known only as Loughlan, who happens to be the father of the aforementioned Mikey, decides they should add Jimmy to their group ("Why not? Wouldn't it be ironic to have the son of the man I killed working for us?"). When Jimmy refuses to join them, they turn on him. Loughlan arranges for henchman 'Seagull' to return from his successful mission in [[Hong Kong]] on a direct flight to Trim airfield in order to take part in the festival. Meanwhile Mikey has Nicola kidnapped and leaves Jimmy a note warning him to "Loose [sic] or else".  Jimmy's fortunes begin to change when he is brought under the tutelage of a group of mysterious local monks who had trained his father, a martial arts champion, many years before. Under the guidance of the mysterious head monk, Jimmy undertakes an intensive training programme in preparation for the tournament. Jimmy goes on to reach the final, where he faces Seagull. After remembering that he had witnessed the local drug lord kill his father with a sword in the front of him, back when he was a child, he defeats Seagull with a well-timed use of the mysterious "Fatal Deviation" move as taught to him by the head monk.  Having triumphed over Seagull, Jimmy then takes on the gang and rescues his girlfriend. In doing so, he kills Mikey. On hearing of his son's death the gang leader seeks bloody vengeance ("You killed my son, now I'm going to kill you, just as I killed your father"), but Jimmy ultimately dispatches him too. The film ends with Jimmy reunited with his girlfriend and looking confidently forward to a happy and peaceful future in Trim.

Festen
 Helge ([[Henning Moritzen]]), a respected businessman and family patriarch, is celebrating his 60th birthday at the family-run hotel. Gathered together amongst many family and friends are his wife Else ([[Birthe Neumann]]), his sullen eldest son Christian ([[Ulrich Thomsen]]), his boorish younger son Michael ([[Thomas Bo Larsen]]), and his well-traveled daughter Helene ([[Paprika Steen]]). Christian's twin sister, Linda, has recently taken her life at the hotel. Before the birthday dinner, Helene finds Linda's [[suicide note]], but hides it in a medicine bottle after becoming upset by the undisclosed contents. Michael fights with his wife, whom he had earlier abandoned on the roadside with their three children, and then has sex with her. He is later pulled aside by a waitress with whom he had made pregnant in an affair and beats her when she disparages Helge.   Later, during dinner, Christian makes a speech to the family in which he accuses Helge of [[sexual abuse|sexually abusing]] him and Linda as children. There is an initial shocked silence, but the party gradually returns to normal, as the guests react by silent denial. In a private conversation in the pantry, a seemingly baffled Helge asks Christian about his motivations for [[slander]]ing him, and Christian appears to recant his accusation. However, Christian is spurred to further action by hotel chef Kim (Bjarne Henriksen), a childhood friend who knows about the abuse. He then continues his toast by accusing Helge of causing Linda's death. Helge speaks to Christian alone and threateningly offers to make his own toast bringing up Christian's troubled personal history, impotence with women and his perhaps-[[incest|incestuous]] relationship with Linda. Christian says nothing in response to the threat.   Further exacerbating the tensions of the day, Helene's black boyfriend Gbatokai (Gbatokai Dakinah) shows up, causing the racist Michael to lead most of the partygoers in singing the Danish song "[[Jeg har set en rigtig negermand]]" to offend him. During a toast, Else makes a series of back-handed compliments towards her children, accusing Christian of having an overactive imagination and asking him to apologize for his earlier accusation. Christian responds by accusing her of interrupting Helge during the abuse, yet not interfering with the incident, and calling her a "[[cunt]]". Michael and two other guests violently eject Christian from the hotel. When Christian walks back in, they beat Christian and tie him to a tree in the nearby woods. As Christian unties himself and returns, Helene has a headache and asks one of the waitresses, Pia, to fetch her pills. Pia finds Linda's suicide note and gives it to Christian.   Christian gives the suicide note to Helene, who reads it aloud in front of the guests. Linda's note states that she decided to kill herself after feeling overwhelmed by dreams of Helge's abuse. Helge angrily admits to his misdeeds and leaves the dining room with the guests stunned. A drunk Christian faints after walking out of the dining hall and imagines seeing Linda. When he awakes, he learns from Helene that Michael is missing. Michael, also drunk, has called Helge outside and beaten his father severely, promising him that he will never see his grandchildren again. The next morning, the family and guests eat breakfast nonchalantly. Helge comes in and speaks to the group, admitting his wrongdoing and declaring his love for his children. Michael coolly dismisses their father from the table. Christian reveals that he is going back to [[Paris]], and asks Pia -- who has known Christian for years -- to accompany him.

Firestorm (1998 film)
 A group of Wyoming State convicts stage an escape with the help of an [[arsonist]] on the outside, who sets fire in the forest so that the prisoners will be taken there to help firemen, giving the prisoners a chance to escape. Randall Alexander Shaye ([[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]]), who had stolen US$37 million four years previously and hidden it in the Wyoming forest, kills his cellmate and takes his identity as he and five other escapees go to retrieve the money. They pose as Canadian firefighters and take Jennifer ([[Suzy Amis]]), a bird watcher, hostage along the way. Unbeknownst to all of them, another forest fire has started due to a lightning strike from a week earlier.  Jesse Graves ([[Howie Long]]) is a [[smokejumper]], who must find a way to stop Shaye and his group of convicts and save Jennifer at the same time. Over the course of the film, Shaye starts to kill off his men in order to collect the money himself, starting with fellow prisoners Wilkins, a mapmaker and Karge, a former wrestler, but finds out that the money was destroyed in the fire. He then proceeds to kill Loomis, a former Air Force pilot by pushing him off a cliff to make it look like an accident, and shoots Packer, a serial rapist, after he gets caught in a spring trap set up by Jesse. Wynt Perkins ([[Scott Glenn]]), Jesse's mentor and friend, does everything he can to help Jesse, and to save Jennifer.  Jennifer tells Jesse that she was a [[Marines|Marine]], before she became a bird watcher. She and Jesse try to give out smoke signals to have his friends find him before the two separate forest fires will collide and will suck up all the oxygen. Wynt arrives to save a busload of prisoners and fire fighters when they were forced at gunpoint to get inside the vehicle. He hotwires the bus and drives it away to safety. Wynt then catches up with Jesse and comes up with a plan. Jesse begins to realize his friend knew that there was a fire from the beginning and never told anyone.  Wynt tells Jesse he started the forest fire in order for a land developer to build a training school for fire fighters, but knew nothing of the prison break. Jesse tells him it wasn't his fault and promises he will keep his crime a secret from his friends. Wynt confronts Shaye by telling him Shaye's lawyers set him up to take the fall. He shoots Shaye in the leg, but is killed in the process. Jesse throws a fire axe into Shaye's chest, causing him to fall off the boat he and Jennifer were in. Jesse and Jennifer use the boat as an air pocket to keep from drowning, and to prevent themselves from getting burned alive as the firestorm destroys the area. Suddenly, gunshots start coming from underneath them and a couple of bullets make a hole in the boat.  Shaye survives his injury and plans on killing Jennifer and Jesse. Jesse gets the upper hand and kills Shaye by shoving his head through the hole under the boat, causing his face to burn till there's nothing left. Heavy rainfall then drowns out the fire and Jesse and Jennifer swim to shore, where they wait to be rescued. Jennifer also realizes that the eggs she had with her have hatched, much to the pleasure of Jesse.

Flowers of Shanghai
 In four elegant brothels, called "Flower Houses", in [[fin-de-siècle]] 19th-century [[Shanghai]] ([[Qing dynasty]]), we see several affairs. Events presumably take place in 1884, a year named in one of the scenes. The action involves four men who live for pleasure pursuing a number of courtesans, and takes place mostly in the light of oil lamps.  The courtesans are known as Crimson, Pearl, Emerald, Jasmin and Jade. Crimson belongs to the Huifang Enclave (薈芳里) brothel. Pearl and Jade work in the Gongyang Enclave (公陽里) brothel. Emerald resides in the Shangren Enclave (尚仁里) brothel, and Jasmin works at the East Hexing Enclave (東合興里) brothel. The relationship between the wealthy patrons and the [[courtesan]]s are semi-monogamous, frequently lasting many years.  The courtesans are purchased at an early age by the owners of the brothels, known as "aunties". In spite of the trappings of luxury and the wealth surrounding them, the graceful, well-bred courtesans live lives of slavery. The girls, and especially those with less forgiving aunties, are frequently beaten for misbehavior, though such beatings are not seen in the film. Because of the oppressive social conventions, the best that the courtesans, known as "flower girls", can hope for is to pay off their debts some day (often by aid of a wealthy patron) or marry into a better social position.  Much of the film concerns the silent Master Wang who leaves the courtesan Crimson after their 2 and-a-half-year relationship in favor of the younger courtesan Jasmin, with whom he has fallen in love. He offers to settle Crimson's debts as compensation for leaving her, as he is her only caller and her only source of income. Crimson is in dire need of money, as she is the sole provider of her entire family. They agree to a settlement. However, Master Wang still has feelings for Crimson. When he finds out she is having an affair with an actor, he launches into a drunken rage. He marries Jasmin and, promoted, departs for Guangdong. It is later rumored that Wang has struck Jasmin, who responded by attempting suicide.   Emerald was bought for 100 dollars by her auntie as a child. Master Luo wants to help but her freedom costs many times that value. The negotiation goes on throughout the film, and with the help of Master Hong and Emerald, Luo was finally able to negotiate a satisfactory price and took Emerald away from the brothel.  Another courtesan, Jade, has been promised by her lover, the young and immature Master Zhu, that if they cannot be married together, they will die together. When it is apparent that the marriage will not occur, she gives Zhu opium in an attempt to poison him. He spits it out and is aided by other girls as Jade, in a bout of contempt and anger, is restrained. Ultimately Master Zhu paid a hefty $10,000 so that Jade can buy out her contract and be married off as proper woman.

Following
 A struggling, unemployed young writer (credited as "The Young Man") takes to following strangers around the streets of [[London]], ostensibly to find inspiration for his first novel. Initially, he sets strict rules for himself regarding whom he should follow and for how long, but he soon discards them as he focuses on a well-groomed, handsome man in a dark suit. The man in the suit, having noticed he is being followed, quickly confronts the Young Man and introduces himself as "Cobb". Cobb reveals that he is a serial burglar and invites the Young Man (who tells Cobb his name is "Bill") to accompany him on various burglaries. The material gains from these crimes seem to be of secondary importance to Cobb. He takes pleasure in rifling through the personal items in his targets' flats and drinking their wine. He explains that his true passion is using the shock of robbery and violation of property to make his victims re-examine their lives. He sums up his attitude thus: "You take it away, and show them what they had."  The Young Man is thrilled by Cobb's lifestyle. He attempts break-ins of his own, as Cobb encourages and guides him. At Cobb's suggestion, he alters his appearance, cutting his hair short and wearing a dark suit. He assumes the name "Daniel Lloyd" based on the credit card Cobb gives to him and begins to pursue a relationship with a blonde woman whose flat he and Cobb burgled. The Blonde turns out to be the girlfriend of a small-time gangster (known only as the "Bald Guy") whom she broke up with after he murdered a man in her flat. Soon, the Blonde confides that the Bald Guy is blackmailing her with incriminating photographs. The Young Man breaks into the Bald Guy's safe, but is caught in the act by an unidentified man. He then bludgeons the man with a claw hammer and flees with the Bald Guy's money and photos. Upon returning to his flat, he finds that the photos are innocuous modeling shots.  Confronting the Blonde, the Young Man learns that she and Cobb have been working together to manipulate him into mimicking Cobb's burglary methods. She tells him that Cobb had recently discovered a murdered woman's body during one of his burglaries and is attempting to deflect suspicion from himself by making it appear as though multiple burglars share his [[Modus Operandi|MO]].  The Young Man leaves to turn himself in to the police. The Blonde reports her success to Cobb, who then reveals that he actually works for the Bald Guy. The story about the murdered woman was part of a plot to deceive both the Blonde and the Young Man: The Blonde has been blackmailing the Bald Guy with evidence from the murder he committed in her flat, and he wants her murdered in such a way that it cannot be connected to him. Cobb bludgeons the Blonde to death with the same claw hammer that the Young Man used during the burglary of the Bald Guy's safe and leaves it at the scene. The police, checking out the Young Man's story, find the Blonde murdered and the claw hammer with his fingerprints on it. The Young Man is thus implicated for the murder of the blonde woman. Cobb, meanwhile, vanishes into a crowd.

Ghulam (film)
  Siddharth "Siddhu "Marathe ([[Aamir Khan]]) is a Mumbai tapori, a boxing champion. His brother, Jaidev "Jai" ([[Rajit Kapur]]), is the accounts manager and right-hand man for Raunak "Ronnie" Singh ([[Sharat Saxena]]), a former boxing champion who ostensibly runs a travel agency, but in reality rules the local community by terrorising people and stealing money from innocent merchants. Other than his boxing practice, Siddhu leads a relatively aimless and wanderlust life. In his spare time, he hangs out with friends, occasionally stealing money from rich people. Siddhu is financially dependent on his elder brother Jai, who lives in Raunak Singh's house, but occasionally visits Siddhu and tops up his finances.  The opening scene features a female lawyer Fatima Madam ([[Mita Vashisht]]) defending Siddhu in court against accusations of small-time theft. The lawyer tries to convince the judge to show leniency towards Siddhu on account of his disadvantaged background as an orphan. The judge points out that Siddhu has already been shown leniency four times, and is greeted with laughter by everybody, including Siddhu. In the commotion, Siddhu steals Rs. 400 from his own lawyer's purse. Siddhu is let free. Later, when he asks the lawyer what her fees are, she asks him for a fees of Rs. 400, and he is thus forced to part with the money he has just stolen. The lawyer gives no indication of awareness that Siddhu had stolen an equal amount of money. Later, Siddhu, while joking around with friends, gets angry when one of his friends suggests that the lawyer may be receiving sexual favours from Siddhu in exchange for defending him in court.  A few days later, Raunak Singh hires Siddhu to deliver a letter to a local [[cricket]] player, and to beat up the player if he shows signs of resisting. Unknown to Siddhu, the letter contains instructions to the player to get out after scoring a certain number of runs, so that Ronnie can win a bet. Siddhu delivers the letter and intimidates the cricket player into agreeing to follow the instructions, breaking the player's bat in the process. Later, while returning, he gets into a motorcycle speed race with a motorcycle gang led by Charlie ([[Deepak Tijori]]), which escalates into a dare game to run towards a moving train at night. Siddhu beats Charlie's past record in the game. Charlie chooses to run again, but falls on the train tracks, and seems to be headed for death as the train approaches him. Siddhu rescues Charlie at considerable personal risk. In the process, Siddhu becomes friends with Alisha ([[Rani Mukerji]]), also part of the gang, and their friendship blossoms into love. The famous song ''[[Aati Kya Khandala]]'' is situated during this period, when Siddhu is trying to cheer Alisha up after a fight with her father.  It is revealed that Siddhu saw his own father's death when he was a child, which mentally affected him throughout his life.  Back in his local community, Siddhu witnesses an incident of some of Ronnie's men beating up a local restaurateur for not paying extortion money to Ronnie's gang. The restaurateur runs for his life as Ronnie's men chase him, but none of the other community people come to his aid. Harihar Mafatlal ([[Akshay Anand]]), a social worker, coaxes a police constable to stop the fight. The restaurateur and his two assailants land up on the roof where Siddhu is doing boxing practice, with Hari and the constable following. The constable breaks up the fight and scolds the restaurateur, and Hari is angry at the constable for [[blaming the victim]]. The assailants leave, greeting Siddhu on the way out. Siddhu offers some water to the restaurateur and introduces himself to Hari, suggesting to both to avoid getting on the wrong side of Ronnie. Hari speaks of principle and [[self-respect]], and Siddhu is reminded of things that his father told him long ago.  Ronnie is furious to hear about this, and wishes to kill the restaurateur and Hari immediately. Ronnie explains the logic of terror to his henchmen: if even a few people stop acceding to his demands, then that will instill rebelliousness against Ronnie's demands in others. Fear is essential for the kind of respect Ronnie enjoys, and being lenient against a few people who stand up to him based on a short-term [[cost–benefit analysis]] will have long-term negative consequences for Ronnie. Jai, however, dissuades Ronnie from taking rash action. In the process, it is revealed that Jai and Ronnie are in the process of bribing politicians and government officials to make Ronnie the owner of a large construction project.  Hari later canvasses some villagers together, trying to get one of them to sign a complaint against Ronnie that can be filed with the police so that official action can be taken against him. Siddhu attends the meeting at Jai's request, but does not inform Jai or Ronnie about it immediately. Instead, Siddhu offers Hari a friendly warning to [[cease and desist]] these activities. During the conversation that ensues, Siddhu says that his own motto in life is simple: [[wikt:live and let live|live and let live]]. Hari reveals the principle guiding his own actions: whenever he sees himself in the mirror, he should not feel ashamed of what he sees.  Ronnie nonetheless comes to know of the events during the meeting, and is angry. He tells Siddhu to arrange a meeting between Hari and himself (Ronnie) so that Ronnie can dissuade Hari from these activities. Siddhu agrees, and calls Hari over to a bridge, on the pretext that he himself (Siddhu) needs to talk to Hari. Hari arrives at the bridge, expecting to meet Siddhu. Ronnie arrives along with his men, beats up Hari, and throws him from the bridge after which he is crushed under a moving train. Siddhu is furious at Jai and Ronnie, and attacks Ronnie physically, but Ronnie's men control him, and he is allowed to go on account of the fact that he is Jai's brother and he was the one who managed to inadvertently help Ronnie kill Hari. Siddhu, returning home, cannot bear the sight of himself in the mirror, and breaks it. It is also revealed that Hari was the brother of Alisha (Siddhu's romantic interest), something Siddhu had been unaware of because he was living separately. Siddhu confesses everything to Fatima Madam, the female lawyer who had defended him in the beginning of the movie, but refuses to testify against Ronnie in court, for fear of implicating his elder brother Jai. The lawyer tries to talk him into testifying, but fails. She challenges him to reveal the truth to Alisha, which he does, and they break up.  In a subsequent boxing match (against boxing champion "Kala Tiger"), that Siddhu has been preparing for several months, Siddhu is told by his brother, in the midst of the game, to throw the match, since Ronnie has bet money on Siddhu losing. Siddhu throws the game, allowing the other boxer to beat him unconscious. He is furious at his brother, and they have an oral confrontation. In the process, Siddhu is forced to confront that his father had betrayed five of his friends in the [[Indian independence movement]] to the British out of fear of being tortured, causing all of them to be killed. Siddhu realises that his father was a good man, but, like everybody else, was a coward and lacked the strength to fight injustice. Yet, he knows that his father wanted to instill these values in him, and he vows to bring Hari's killers to justice and complete the task that Hari attempted to begin. He tells Fatime Madam (the lawyer) that he is willing to testify publicly against Ronnie as well as against his own brother Jai, and also confesses to her his theft of Rs. 400 (shown at the beginning of the movie). She expresses pride in Siddhu, revealing that she knew all along about the theft and also knew that Siddhu would reveal it to her some day of his own accord. She tries to get Alisha to forgive Siddhu, but fails. Siddhu, now a reformed man, meets up with the cricketer he had beaten up a while back, presents him with a new cricket bat, and seeks forgiveness.  When Ronnie discovers that Siddhu is the person who has filed a complaint against him, he is ready to kill Siddhu. Jai dissuades Ronnie, reassuring him that Jai himself will dissuade Siddhu from testifying publicly against Ronnie. In an emotional scene, Siddhu, when approached by Jai, confronts Jai instead, accusing Jai of neglecting his duties as an elder brother by encouraging Siddhu to follow himself in a life of crime. Jai realises his error and apologises. Upon returning home, Siddhu discovers Alisha waiting for him, and they embrace and reconcile. Later that night, Ronnie kills Jai and his men also try to kill Siddhu, but the motorcycle gang led by Charlie (whose life Siddhu had saved earlier) intervenes to save Siddhu's life. Siddhu wants to kill Ronnie in person to avenge his brother's death, but the female lawyer arrives in time to dissuade him.  The next day, in court, Siddhu gives his testimony regarding Ronnie's murder of Hari. The court is adjourned until Monday. Coming out of court, Ronnie orders for a local [[bandh]] and forces all the shops to close down. He also has Siddhu's home broken into and his belongings thrown on the street. Siddhu, upon seeing this, walks up to Ronnie's house and challenges him to come out and duel alone, rather than hiding behind henchmen. Ronnie agrees, and all the people in the area come out to watch. The two boxers have a long and bloody boxing match, with nobody interfering. As the local people see one man with the courage to fight Raunak Singh, they awaken to the possibility that they too can resist his extortionary demands. Ronnie loses the fight, but he then orders his henchmen to kill Siddhu. The local people, who are much more numerous than Ronnie's henchmen, block the attempt. Together, they beat up Ronnie and his henchmen and force them to flee the area.

As he stumbles out of the party, he has a chance meeting with a woman named Mallory Doss ([[Embeth Davidtz]]), a waitress at the party who seems to have lost her car. Rick drives the woman to her home, where her car has been already parked, seemingly by her father, Dixon Doss ([[Robert Duvall]]). Rick and Mallory walk into the house arguing about her abusive father. Mallory carelessly undresses in front of him, after which they spend the night together.  The next day, Mallory asks him to file suit against her father because of his dangerous behavior. Having started a relationship with Mallory, Rick agrees and is successful in having Dixon put on trial thanks to favors from his staff, including his investigator, Clyde Pell ([[Robert Downey, Jr.]]). Mallory's ex-husband, Pete Randle ([[Tom Berenger]]) also takes the stand, to testify about his former father-in-law's erratic behavior. Dixon appeals to the judge, claiming that the charges against him are fabricated and exaggerated, but the judge sentences him to a mental institution. Upon being taken away, Dixon attempts to attack Magruder, vowing revenge. With her father institutionalized, Magruder and Mallory continue their relationship, but not long after, Dixon is able to escape from the institution. Scared of retaliation, Magruder assigns Pell to guard Mallory while he attempts to gain support from the police to apprehend Dixon. The police are unhelpful, even after Dixon and his friends set Mallory's car on fire, due to the many cases Magruder has won against them.  A short time later, Magruder receives an unmarked letter containing pictures of his children with their faces cut out of them. Worried for his children, he decides to take them out of school, despite not having full custody of his children and needing his wife's permission to take them. Over the objections of the teachers, Magruder escapes with his children, after assaulting a school employee. Magruder calls Pell, impelling him to find Dixon Doss. Pell informs Magruder there is now a warrant out for his arrest. Magruder takes the children to a motel. He goes outside the room to call his wife ([[Famke Janssen]]) to assure her that he has done what he has for their safety, but during the call, Magruder's children are apparently taken by Dixon's crew, and he is forced to rendezvous with Mallory so that she can lead him to her father's house. After they arrive, Magruder forces Dixon into a standoff where the older man is killed with a shot through the throat. Mallory then yells that Dixon's men are escaping with Magruder's children, and he is forced to give chase. However, upon catching them, his children are not with them, having been turned in to the police office hours earlier. Magruder is arrested by the police and Mallory is picked up back at her father's house, which is now in flames.  In the aftermath, Magruder is charged with murder and is threatened with disbarment. Realizing that he has been set up, Magruder has Clyde look into Mallory's background, suspicious that she might have something to gain from her father's death. The search reveals that Dixon's land isn't worth much, but the timber ([[black walnut]]) on it is worth millions, and on top of that, Mallory had never actually divorced Pete Randle. With no will found, Mallory, and by relation, Randle, are granted ownership of Dixon's estate. Suspicious of Randle, Clyde and Magruder track the man down. Clyde is killed by Randle, and Magruder is forced into a desperate struggle in the middle of a violent hurricane. While the two grapple with one another, Mallory arrives and shoots Randle in the back with a flare gun. Her husband falls into the flood waters below, dead.

As the film concludes, Magruder decides not to fight the charges against him, accepting a plea deal that involves community service.

Gini Avi Saha Gini Keli
 Since the entire film is focused on the rise and demise of Padmasiri, the storyline will be described according to important milestones of his life.  ===The Rise of Padme=== It was the 1980s. Padmasiri or "Padme" as known by his colleagues is having a friendly gathering with a mudalali [[businessman]] in his village. Padme whilst polishing his [[shotgun]] mentions to mudalali, his desire to shoot a fat-bellied man. Mudalali with a laugh tells Padme that it could easily be done by making a visit to the town at night time. Padme then shoots mudalali with anger, shouting only he, himself can have a [[butchery]] in town. This marks the beginning of a criminal; a criminal who would later take several lives to fulfil his lifelong ambition; that is to become the [[Boss (crime)|godfather]] of Sri Lankan [[mafias]].  Meanwhile, a new inspector of police (Rangana Premarathne) was appointed to the village. Unlike previous police chiefs, he was a young, brave and a strict officer of law who would go to great lengths to bring law and order. Soon Padme receives a message to go and visit the new inspector. With anger Padme visits the police station. He was asked politely by the inspector to stop selling illicit liquor. Padme nods with a smile and leaves the station. Next day, the inspector receives an invitation by Padme to come and visit him in his residence. Ignoring warnings and comments the inspector bravely visits Padme, because it was a very polite invitation. After offering some refreshments to the Policemen, Padme takes them to his garden. A car key was handed over to the inspector, mentioning that he always treats well policemen who visits Padme in person. He also mentions that the car itself was bought using money generated through his illicit businesses. The inspector with anger, shouts at Padme in-front of Padme's gang, whilst putting him down on top of the car. With vigour, the inspector yells at Padme to stop immediately all his illicit businesses. He also threatens to set the whole place on fire, if his order is not carried out within 24 hours.  Soon after the police [[jeep]] left, Padme yells at villagers to make a pile of all cans and containers in front of his house. He then starts making a public speech, criticising the Police department. The news of Padme having a public gathering without permission travels to the Police station immediately. The inspector with several constables decides to visit Padme once again, however armed with firearms. Soon a violent clash occurs between the inspector and Padme, soon after Padme refused to cancel his speech and surrender to Police. The inspector however wins from the clash with Padme. He was put behind bars, soaked in his own blood.  Meanwhile, Padme's uncle (Raja Sumanapala) visits the local member of parliament ([[Member of Parliament|MP]]), someone whom Padme has helped to win the election to release Padme from the Police [[Detention of suspects|remand]]. Soon Padme was bailed-out. The inspector was also transferred to another Police station, however with a promotion. On the day the inspector was leaving the village for good, he pays a private visit to Padme's residence. The ex-inspector advises  Padme to stop selling illicit liquor to people and try to become a good person. Padme with a smile praises the ex-inspector, and finally tells him that '''they''' promoted him, mainly because the ex-inspector is a valued true hero.  ===Padme vs. Mahawaththe Lokayaa (the World-Thug)=== Even though Padme was relieved after the police inspector was transferred, he soon found out that another [[mafia]] boss named "Mahawaththe Lokayaa" (World-Thug) was selling [[Heroine]] in Padme's village. A majority of local youth were addicted to [[Heroine]] and Padme's men were complaining on a daily basis on the difficulty of finding labour for their businesses. Padme was also approached by many parents in the village to bail-out their sons whom were taken into [[Police custody|custody]] by the Police when caught with drugs.  After a series of confrontations between the two, Padme befriends a petty thug in the area named "Rambo"; in order to kill Lokayaa. Padme's efficient exploitation of Rambo's anger against Lokayaa is evident when the thug was cut into pieces by Rambo whilst walking home alone on a night after visiting a brothel.  ===Politicising crimes=== Soon after the killing of Lokayaa, Padme was approached by many politicians to kill their opponents. Padme eagerly takes such contracts in order to earn quick money. He did many violent killings under the safety net of politicians. The anti-government youth movement during the time was also blamed for many of Padme's executions.  However Padme finds out soon that he cannot protect himself without the help of even more powerful MPs, when Rambo was killed violently by gang maintained by another politician. With hesitation he leaves the local MP who was in the opposition party (to whom Padme worked so far) and joins a ruling party MP. This however angers the gang maintained by the same MP. It is further revealed at the latter part of the film that Padme was also made a [[Justice of the Peace]] (JP) by the MP he works for.  ===The Demise of Padme=== The now defunct gang, previously maintained by the same MP to whom Padme now works for; hires an assassin to kill Padme under the financial backing of a disgruntled social club owner. Disguised as a Police messenger, they ask Padme to report to the inspector in the nearby Police station. Padme then visits the station the next day with his nephew, only to find out that such a message was never sent.  On his way out, Padme was interrupted by a youth, dressed in white. After getting the confirmation from Padme of his identity, the young man shoots directly at Padme using a [[revolver]] many times, one at his head at and a few at his chest. Whilst Padme's young nephew tries to wake the dead body of Padme, the smiling assassin tries to escape by getting onto his motorcycle. However he too gets shot by the Police.  The film ends with Padme's nephew crying at his uncle's slain body. The audience is notified in ending credits that the story continues.  
Gods and Monsters (film)
 The story opens in the 1950s, after the [[Korean War]]; it has been more than a decade since James Whale, director of ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', has retired. He lives with his long-time housemaid, Hanna, who loyally cares for him but disapproves of his homosexuality. Whale has suffered a series of strokes that have left him fragile and tormented by memories: growing up as a poor outcast, his tragic [[World War I]] service, and the filming of ''Bride of Frankenstein''. Whale slips into his past, and indulges in his fantasies, reminiscing about gay pool parties and also sexually teasing an embarrassed, starstruck fan who comes to interview him. Whale battles depression, at times contemplating suicide, as he realizes his life, his attractiveness, and his health are slipping away.   Whale befriends his young, handsome gardener and former Marine, Clayton Boone and the two begin a sometimes uneasy friendship as Boone poses for Whale's sketches. The two men bond while discussing their lives and dealing with Whale's spells of disorientation and weakness from the strokes. Boone, impressed with Whale's fame, watches ''Bride of Frankenstein'' on TV as his friends mock the movie, his friendship with Whale, and Whale's intentions.  Boone assures Whale that he is straight and receives assurance from Whale that there is no sexual interest, but Boone storms out when Whale graphically discusses his sexual history. Boone later returns with the agreement that no such "locker room" discussions occur again. Boone is invited to escort Whale to a party hosted by [[George Cukor]] for [[Princess Margaret]]. There, a photo op has been arranged for Whale with "his Monsters": [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Elsa Lanchester]] from "ancient" movie fame. This event exacerbates his depression. A sudden rain storm becomes an excuse to leave.  Back at Whale's home, Boone needs a dry change of clothes. Whale can only find a sweater, so Boone wears a towel wrapped around his waist. Whale decides to try to sketch Boone one more time. After some minutes, he shows his sketches to Boone, disclosing that he has lost his ability to draw. After Boone drops his towel to pose nude, Whale makes him wear a World War I gas mask and then uses the opportunity to make a sexual advance on Boone, kissing his shoulder. Boone becomes enraged and attacks Whale, who confesses that this had been his plan and begs Boone to kill him to relieve him of his suffering. Boone refuses, puts Whale to bed, then sleeps downstairs. The next morning, Hanna is alarmed when she cannot find Whale, prompting a search by Boone and Hanna. Boone finds Whale floating dead in the pool, as a distraught Hanna runs out clutching a [[suicide note]]. Boone and Hanna agree that Boone should disappear from the scene to avoid a scandal.  The film closes roughly a decade later as Boone and his young son, Michael, watch ''Bride of Frankenstein'' on television. The son is skeptical of his father's claim that he knew Whale, but Clayton produces a sketch of the Frankenstein monster drawn by Whale, and signed, "To Clayton. Friend?" "Friend?", being a plea from the original misfit, Frankenstein's monster, and disclosing Whale's true intentions.  
Godzilla (1998 film)
 A marine [[iguana]] nest is exposed to the fallout of radiation following a military [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear test]] in [[French Polynesia]]. In the [[South Pacific Ocean]], a Japanese fishing vessel is suddenly attacked by an enormous sea creature, with only one seaman surviving. Traumatized, he is questioned by a mysterious Frenchman in a hospital regarding what he saw, to which he only replies "[[Godzilla|Gojira]]."  Dr. Niko "Nick" Tatopoulos, an [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|NRC]] scientist, is in the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone|Chernobyl exclusion zone]] in Ukraine researching the effects of radiation on wildlife, but he is interrupted by the arrival of an official from the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]]. He is sent to [[Panama]] and [[Jamaica]], escorted by the military, to observe a trail of wreckage across land leading to the recovered Japanese fishing ship with massive claw marks on it. Dr. Tatopoulos identifies skin samples he discovered in the shipwreck as belonging to an unknown species. He dismisses the military's theory that the creature is a living dinosaur, instead deducing that it is a mutant created by nuclear testing. It travels to [[New York City]] during the rainy season, leaving a path of destruction in its wake.  The city is evacuated before the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] attempts to kill it but fails in an initial attempt. Nick collects a blood sample, and after performing a pregnancy test, discovers that the creature reproduces asexually and is collecting food for its offspring. Eventually, Dr. Tatopoulos meets up with his ex-girlfriend, Audrey Timmonds, a young news reporter who wants to find a story. While she visits him, she uncovers a classified tape in his provisional military tent which concerns the origins of the monster, and turns it over to the media. She hopes to have her report put on TV in hopes to become famous, but her superior and boss, Charles Caiman, uses the tape in his broadcast, declaring it as his own discovery, and dubs the creature "[[Zilla (TriStar Godzilla)|Godzilla]]".  With the classified information released mainly because of his actions, Nick is removed from the operation, and abandons Audrey. Soon, he is kidnapped by Philippe Roaché, an "insurance guy" he met before coming to Manhattan. Revealing himself as an agent of the [[Directorate-General for External Security|French secret service]], Philippe and his colleagues have been keeping close watch on the events and plan to cover up their country's role in the nuclear testing that created Godzilla. Suspecting a nest somewhere in the city, they cooperate with Nick to trace and destroy it.  Following a second encounter with the military, Godzilla dives into the [[Hudson River]] to evade the military, where he is attacked by [[United States Navy|Navy]] submarines. After colliding with torpedoes, Godzilla sinks. Believing he is finally dead, the authorities celebrate.  Meanwhile, Nick and Philippe's strike team, followed by Audrey and her cameraman Victor "Animal" Palotti, find the nest inside [[Madison Square Garden]] and locate over 200 eggs. Before the French can succeed in destroying them, the eggs suddenly hatch and the offspring attack. Nick, Animal, Audrey and Philippe take refuge in the Garden's broadcast booth and successfully send out a live news-report to alert the military of what will happen if the offspring escape. A prompt response involving an airstrike is initiated as the four escape moments before [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] jets bomb the arena.  Audrey and Nick reconcile and kiss, before the adult Godzilla, having survived, emerges from the Garden's ruins. Enraged by the deaths of its young, it chases the four across Manhattan. After a taxi chase, they manage to trap Godzilla within the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] where the returning Air Force jets manage to shoot it down. Godzilla dies from its wounds, while the remaining citizens celebrate. Audrey tells Caiman that she quits working for him after what he did, before leaving with Nick. Philippe (taking a tape that Animal was recording and promising to return it after "removing a few items from it") thanks Nick for his help and parts ways.  Meanwhile, back at the ruins of Madison Square Garden, a single surviving egg hatches and the emerging hatchling roars.

This leads to a cycle of retributive violence, as the young man seeks vengeance for the death of his father, sister and fiancée.  The movie opens with a scene where two corrupt politicians hire two different crime lords viz. Lambu Aatta and Bulla to kill each other. Lambu Aatta kills one of the accomplices of Bulla and initiates the war, later Bulla settles the score by killing Lambu Aatta's brother. Lambu Aatta bounces back by raping and subsequently killing Bulla's sister. Bulla is ultimately able to kill Lambu Aatta and win the war. Now the undisputed leader of the underworld, Bulla is hired by a corrupt politician Bachubhai Bhigona (Deepak Shirke) to murder his rival. Bulla sends his right-hand man Kala Shetty (Rami Reddy) to do the job. Shetty successfully commits the murder in front of several gawking policemen, but as soon as he is able to outrun the police he is caught and turned over to the authorities by Shankar (Mithun Chakraborty). Here we are introduced to the protagonist who works as a coolie in a shipyard, and sometimes at the airport. He lives in relative comfort with his policeman father, his sister, Geeta, and a pet monkey called Tinchu. Shankar also has a girlfriend named Ganga, who wants to get married to him as soon as possible, but Shankar has bigger things to worry about.  Shankar further enrages Bulla by entering a fighting competition organized by Bulla at the shipyard. Shankar does not enter to win money or fame for himself, but only to win the money so that some other labourer can marry off his daughter. He manages to defeat Bulla's prize fighter, by just twisting his hand for few seconds! The animosity is raised further when Shankar's father is beaten up by Bulla's goons when his father tries to stop the goons from collecting money from shopkeepers. Shankar reaches the scene and beats Bulla's men, who are able to somersault many feet high in air while fighting. However, Shankar beats all of them with relative ease, though during the fight, it is rather clear that Bulla's men were performing stunts deliberately, and came to the venue only to be thrashed by Shankar.  As revenge, one of Bulla's henchmen, Natte (shortie), abducts Shankar's sister, and tries to molest her. However, she is saved by Gulshan, and she falls in love with Gulshan. But, this turns out to be a scheme by Bulla, as Gulshan marries Geeta and then hands her over to Chuttiya for his pleasure. Bulla gives Chuttiya 'Vitamin Sex' (a likely reference to Viagra, obtained from London, for him to overcome his impotency). However, Geeta dies while being raped by Chuttiya, and he disposes of the body in a jungle. Shankar's monkey, Tinchu sees this and leads Shankar to Bulla's bungalow. Shankar chases Chuttiya to Bulla's doorstep, where he is confronted by Bulla and his henchmen Ibu Hatela (Harish Patel), Pote (Mohan Joshi) and Inspector Kale. Shankar swears revenge on them and then goes his way.  When he learns of his daughter's death, Shankar's father goes mad with grief and threatens Inspector Kale who he blames for being a henchman for Bulla the gangster. After a brief struggle the inspector chokes the old man to death. Shankar meets Bulla and his henchmen and promises them that he will kill all of them in 10 days. On his way back, Shankar finds an abandoned baby girl child, and adopts despite his condition.  Shankar then goes on a rampage and starts killing all of Bulla's accomplices one by one, starting with Gulshan. Shankar finds Ibu Hatela attempting to rape a girl, and beheads him too. However, when he tries to assassinate the politician Bachubhai Bhigona, a sniper from another car kills Bhigona. Shankar is caught and charged for the murder, and is sentenced to a life term in prison. Shankar escapes prison the same night, and goes after Inspector Kale. Shankar is then ambushed by several Kung-fu trained goons with knives, submachine guns and grenades. Shankar thrashes them and kills Kale.  After this, Shankar goes after Chikna, who is employed by Bulla to lure village girls to the city and then force them into prostitution. Before killing Chikna, Shankar learns that the baby girl he adopted was in fact Bulla's illegitimate child.  While Shankar hunts for Pote, Chuttiya and Bulla on the other hand kill his girlfriend Ganga. After killing Pote, Shankar goes to kill Chuttiya. Chuttiya then informs Shankar that he is impotent & it was his elder brother Bulla who gave him vitamin sex which put him into a frenzy & made him violently rape Shankar's sister. Thus, to take revenge, Shankar castrates Chuttiya & says that this is what he deserves.  In the climactic scene, Bulla and Shankar have a showdown in the shipyard-airport complex. Bulla is backed up by several dozen auto-rickshaws that run helter-skelter and attack Shankar.

Great Expectations (1998 film)
  Ten-year-old Finnegan "Finn" Bell, an orphan being raised by his elder sister Maggie and her boyfriend Joe, is playing on a beach in the [[Gulf Coast]] when an escaped convict suddenly pops out of the water and overpowers him. He makes Finn promise to bring back food, medicine and [[bolt cutters]] to get the iron shackles off his leg. Finn complies, but the convict takes him as a hostage and tries to escape by boat to [[Mexico]]. The police seize the small boat heading out to sea. The convict hides on a buoy and the police tow Finn back to land. The next day, Finn sees on the news that the convict was a mobster named Arthur Lustig who had escaped from [[death row]], but has now been recaptured.  Joe is called to do gardening work at "Paradiso Perduto", the mansion of the richest woman in Florida, Nora Dinsmoor. Ms. Dinsmoor has lived as a recluse since she was left at the altar by her fiancé many years before. Finn accompanies Joe and encounters Dinsmoor's young niece, the beautiful Estella. Dinsmoor invites Finn to come back and play with Estella. On Finn's first visit Estella behaves haughtily, but her aunt forces her into sitting for an impromptu portrait by Finn. While he draws, Ms. Dinsmoor warns Finn that he will fall in love with Estella and have his heart broken.  Several years pass. Maggie runs away from home and Joe raises Finn alone. Finn goes to Paradiso Perduto every Saturday and develops into a talented painter. Although Estella is at times flirtatious, even attempting to seduce Finn at one point, she leaves to study abroad in Europe without telling him. Heartbroken, Finn gives up painting and his visits to Paradiso Perduto.  Seven years later, a lawyer comes to Finn and tells him that a gallery owner in [[New York City]] is interested in showing his work. Finn is perplexed but agrees to go. Once he arrives he encounters Estella in the park, whom Ms. Dinsmoor had mentioned was also in New York. Estella is in a relationship with a wealthy businessman, Walter. She resumes her flirtatious behavior towards Finn, posing nude in his apartment and arousing the jealousy of Walter.  Eventually Finn, frustrated by Estella's evasiveness, lures her away from Walter and the two [[sex|make love]]. She tells him that she is going away briefly to visit her aunt, but she will be back to attend the opening of Finn's show. However, on the night of the opening Estella fails to materialize. Instead, Uncle Joe shows up and inadvertently embarrasses Finn with his crudeness. Finn then goes to Estella's abode in New York, hoping to find her there, but instead he finds Ms. Dinsmoor, who reveals that she came to New York to attend Estella's wedding to Walter. When Finn becomes upset at the news, she tells him that Estella was using him all along to make Walter jealous and convince him to marry her. When she realizes how seriously she has upset him, she grows remorseful and apologizes for her manipulation, but it is too late.  Finn returns to his studio to find a strange bearded man wanting to see him: It is none other than Arthur Lustig. Finn is at first incredulous, but then he becomes uncomfortable with the old man's presence and implies that he should leave. As Lustig is walking out the door, his off-hand comments make Finn aware that he, and not the wealthy Ms. Dinsmoor, has in fact been Finn's benefactor during Finn's entire time in New York. Finn thus accompanies Lustig to the subway station.  While they are waiting for a train, Lustig sees two unsavory acquaintances on the opposite platform. Finn and Lustig outmaneuver them and get on a train. They think they are safe, but as the train is in motion one of the two men comes through the car and brutally stabs Lustig in the side. As Lustig bleeds to death in Finn's arms, he reveals that he has been Finn's benefactor in return for the kindness Finn showed him as a child.  Devastated, Finn detaches himself from everything and goes to Paris to study art. He becomes successful in his own right, and eventually returns to Florida to visit his Uncle Joe. Ms. Dinsmoor has since died, but he decides to visit her  house anyway. As he is sitting in the garden, he thinks he sees the apparition of Estella as a child. He follows the little girl through to the back dock where he finds the child's mother, who turns out to be Estella, who has since [[divorce]]d. She admits that she has often thought of him, and asks for his forgiveness for her past cruelty. Finn forgives her and they hold hands looking out over the sea.  
The Governess
 Set in the 1830s, the story centers on Rosina da Silva, the sophisticated eldest daughter of a wealthy Jewish Italian family living in a small enclave of Sephardic [[London Jews]]. When her father is murdered on the street and leaves behind numerous debts, she refuses an arranged marriage to an older suitor, declaring that she will work to support her family, even if she has to take to the stage like her aunt, who is a renowned singer. She decides to use her classical education and advertise her services as a governess, transforming herself into Mary Blackchurch - a [[Protestant]] of partial [[Italy|Italian]] descent - in order to conceal her heritage. She quickly accepts a position as governess for a [[Scotland|Scottish]] family living on the [[Skye|Isle of Skye]] in the [[Hebrides]]. Patriarch Charles Cavendish is a man of science intent on solving the problem of retaining a [[photography|photographic]] image on paper, while his pretentious wife flounders in a sea of [[Boredom|ennui]]. Their young daughter Clementina initially resists Mary's discipline, but eventually finds in her a friend and companion.  Mary, well-educated and unusually curious in an era when a woman's primary focus is keeping house and attending to the needs of her family, surprises Charles with the depth of her interest and ability and becomes his assistant. He is delighted to find a kindred spirit in his isolation, and the admiration she feels soon turns to passion that he reciprocates. While secretly observing [[Passover]] in her room, she spills salt water onto one of Charles' prints, accidentally discovering a technique that preserves the image. The next morning she rushes to the laboratory to tell Charles, and their excitement spills over into making love for the first time. But he becomes increasingly consumed with the race to publish their new process, while she is captivated by the beauty of the photographs they create.  Complications ensue when the Cavendishs' son Henry returns home after being expelled from [[Oxford University]] for smoking [[opium]] and being caught with a prostitute, and he becomes obsessed with Mary. While searching through her belongings, he uncovers evidence of her true background, and although he confesses to her he knows about her past, he promises to keep it secret. But eventually Henry tells Charles that he is in love with Mary, and Charles ridicules his affection and disparagingly remarks that Mary is "practically a [[demimondaine]]", refusing his consent and further alienating his son.  One day she leaves a gift for Charles, a nude photograph that she took of him asleep in the laboratory after lovemaking, and he begins to shun her. When a fellow scientist visits he claims sole credit for the technique she discovered. Angered by his rebuff and betrayal, Mary at first takes it out on Henry, but then decides to leave the island and return to [[London]]. On her way out, conspicuously dressed as a Jew once more, she presents to Mrs. Cavendish at their dinner table the picture of her naked husband.  At home again, she embraces her true identity and becomes a portrait photographer noted for her distinct images of the Jewish people. Her sister announces her next sitter and when Charles appears, she quietly proceeds to take his portrait. When she has finished he asks her if they are done, and she says yes, "quite done," dismissing him. She muses to the audience in closing, "I hardly think of those days at all. No, I don't think of those days at all." But his portrait remains foremost among the scattering of prints in her personal studio.  
The Grandfather (1998 film)
 Don Rodrigo, Count of Albrit, an old Spanish aristocrat, returns to turn-of-the-20th-century Spain after losing his fortune in America. The death of his only son has made him come back to his family estate, now in possession of his daughter-in-law Lucrecia. Upon his return, Don Rodrigo is pleased to meet his granddaughters, Dolly and Nelly, both of whom are adorable and attentive towards him. However, there is something nagging Don Rodrigo.  His son died heartbroken after he discovered his wife was having an affair with a Parisian painter and he left a letter stating that one of the girls is an illegitimate child, not of his blood, and therefore not entitled to be his true heir or true successor to his name and country estate. To the Count of Albrit, it is a matter of honor to know which of the girls is his real granddaughter. To uncover the truth, he confronts his son's widow, Lucrecia.  Lucrecia, now 32, is an English-born beauty with a scandalous reputation, who married the Count’s son when she was 18 and was unfaithful to her husband during their marriage, having an affair with a Parisian painter. Confronting her, the Count of Albrit, who opposed the match, tells her she killed his son, who died of sadness, loneliness, and shame brought on by her infidelity. Lucrecia replies that life is complicated, as are the emotions between men and women. In any case, she vehemently refuses to discuss the matter of her daughter’s paternity.  Lucrecia is well connected. Her latest liaison with Jaime, a government minister, has benefited the village in which her lands lie. When she sees her family relationships and a future move from the provinces to Madrid threatened, she tries to use her standing with the town’s authorities and the local clergy to thwart the old man in his quest. Their plan is to have the Count of Albrit confined in a nearby monastery, but the still-formidable Don Rodrigo quickly realizes their intentions and manages to escape their trap. He reminds some of the smarmy villagers of their checkered past in the days when the Count of Albrit was a power to be reckoned with.  During his quest to find the true origin of his granddaughters, the Count of Albrit befriends the girl’s teacher, poor old Pío Coronado. Too kind for his own good and saddled with six unseen but abusive and sluttish daughters, Coronado would like to kill himself, but he lacks the courage. The straightforward Count tells the tutor that he will be only too happy to toss him off a cliff into the sea, whenever Coronado is ready.  In the meantime, Senén, a mercenary servant, offers an incriminating love letter for sale. The letter implies that Dolly, the eldest of the two girls, who all along has defended forcefully the well being of her grandfather, is the legitimate child. With this piece of information, Don Rodrigo confronts his daughter in law once again. He asks her to allow him to live with Dolly in the family rural estate, but Lucrecia refuses to be parted from any of her daughters without admitting the truth about Dolly’s paternity. Soon after, Lucrecia’s confessor reveals to Don Rodrigo that he has been in the wrong. Nelly is his biological granddaughter. Finally reconciling with the Count of Albrit, Lucrecia leaves for Madrid with Nelly. Dolly stays behind with don Rodrigo, who has his wishes fulfilled. Pio Coronado buries his suicidal intentions.

However, even after nearly 20 years, Loomis refused to believe that Michael was dead, and devoted the rest of his life to studying all information about his former patient. The two investigators then enter his private study, completely untouched by Michael's burglary, and find that the walls are covered with photographs, sketches, and newspaper articles about Michael; from the murder of his sister Judith, to the stealing of her tombstone, to the murders in 1978, as well as articles on Laurie Strode, including her supposed death in an automobile accident.  Meanwhile, in California, Laurie is living a seemingly perfect life with her teen son John and his girlfriend Molly, and has a career as the [[headmistress]] of Hillcrest Academy, a private boarding school where John attends. However, Laurie is far from happy, as the tragic events from 1978 still haunt her and lives in fear that her brother may return. Laurie has tried to get her life together with the hope that Michael would never come after her again. She ultimately faked her death in a car accident, and then relocated to California under an assumed name, Keri Tate.   While a woman and her daughter are at a rest stop, the two narrowly avoid Michael, who steals the woman's car. At the academy campus, the students leave for an overnight field trip at the [[Yosemite National Park]]. Later that evening, John and his girlfriend Molly are having a Halloween party in the basement with their friends, Charlie and his girlfriend Sarah. Charlie goes off into the kitchen and is killed by Michael. Sarah finds Charlie's body and tries to escape via the dumbwaiter, but Michael savagely disfigures her leg before stabbing her to death. John and Molly go searching for their friends and are pursued by Michael through the school grounds. Laurie saves them as Michael corners them. Eventually he and Laurie come face-to-face for the first time in two decades.  Laurie manages to get John and Molly to safety, before heading back to face Michael herself. She decides to return to the school to face Michael once and for all. Laurie succeeds in stopping Michael, but is not satisfied until she knows that he is truly dead. After Michael is loaded into an ambulance, Laurie steals the ambulance with his body. Michael re-animates and attacks Laurie, who swerves and the ambulance drives off the road. Michael tumbles out and is pinned between the ambulance and a fencepost. He reaches out to Laurie, wordlessly pleading for help, and Laurie approaches him warily. She seems to consider helping him, but looks into his eyes and abruptly reconsiders, and decapitates Michael with a fire axe, finally killing him.<ref name="H7"></ref>

Happiness (1998 film)
 Trish Maplewood, the eldest Jordan sister, is an [[upper middle class]] housewife married to [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]] Bill Maplewood and has three children. She appears to have the perfect marriage, but she is unaware of Bill's secret life: he is a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]] who is obsessed with 11-year-old Johnny Grasso, a classmate of their son, Billy. When Johnny comes to the Jordan house for a sleepover, Bill drugs and [[rape]]s him. Later, Bill learns that another boy, Ronald Farber, is home alone while his parents are away in [[Europe]]. Under the guise of attending a [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] meeting, Bill drives to the boy's house and rapes him as well. After Johnny is taken to the hospital and found to have been [[Child sexual abuse|sexually abused]], the police arrive at the Maplewood residence to question Bill. After alerting his wife to the police presence, Bill begins by asking the two detectives, "You said something about Ronald Farber?" The two detectives, looking puzzled, say nothing. Bill then stammers, "I mean, Johnny Grasso." Out on [[bail]], he tearfully admits to Billy that he "fucked" the boys, that he enjoyed it, and that he would do it again. When Billy asks, "Would you ever fuck me?", his father replies, "No... I'd jerk off instead."  Helen Jordan, the middle sister, is a successful author who is adored and envied by everyone she knows, and can have any man she wants. Her charmed life leaves her ultimately unfulfilled, however. She despairs that no one wants her for herself, and that the praise regularly heaped upon her is undeserved. She is fascinated by an unknown man who makes obscene phone calls to her apartment and tries to seek out a relationship with him. But she is disappointed when she finds out the man is her neighbor Allen, to whom she is not attracted. Allen—who is coincidentally one of Bill's patients—sinks into depression as Helen's rejection ruins his fantasies, and he realizes that a woman who truly cares for him, Kristina, has been right under his nose all along.  Joy, the youngest sister, is overly sensitive and lacking direction. She works in telephone sales, but leaves to do something more fulfilling: teaching at an immigrant-education center. Her students call her a scab because their original teacher was striking, and she begins to feel empty in that job too. Joy is also constantly let down in her personal life. After a rejected suitor, Andy, calls Joy shallow at the beginning of the film and then goes on to kill himself, Helen tries to set her up with other men. Expecting to hear from a suitor, she instead gets an obscene call from Allen. Later one of her [[Russian people|Russian]] students, Vlad, offers her a ride in his taxi and they end up having sex. She is initially smitten, but she soon realizes Vlad was using her and that he may be married. After being attacked by his wife and lending him $500 in return for the guitar and stereo he stole from her, she is back to being alone.  Finally, the sisters' parents, Mona and Lenny, are separating after 40 years of marriage, but will not get divorced. Lenny is bored with his marriage, but does not want to start another relationship; he simply "wants to be alone." As Mona copes with being single during her twilight years, Lenny tries to rekindle his enthusiasm for life by having an affair with a neighbor. It is no use, however, as Lenny eventually finds that he has become [[Anhedonia|incapable of feeling]]. The only person who seems happy at the end is Billy, who throughout the film attempts to make himself [[Ejaculation|ejaculate]] and finally succeeds after masturbating to a topless sunbather.

After filling the pumps at the church, Karen returns and saves him by opening the light fitting on the roof for him to escape. They are then spotted by the gang, and hide before having to get out of the water because a nearby transformer is going to blow.  Kenny grabs Tom and they both fall in the water, but Tom fights him off before Kenny is electrocuted and later dies. Tom and Karen enter a nearby house, only to discover locals Doreen ([[Betty White]]) and Henry Sears ([[Richard Dysart]]) who believe they are looters. After explaining their story, Henry decides to give Tom their boat so he can return to the armored truck. When he resurfaces from the now submerged truck, he finds Jim and the gang holding the elderly couple hostage. Tom gets Jim to let them go by promising he'll show them where the money is.   On the way to the cemetery, Jim reveals to Tom that the National Guard were never coming because Charlie was actually calling the gang, and was in an alliance with them. He was only killed because Kenny was never told Charlie was on their side. Jim then sends Tom to retrieve the money but finds it has disappeared. When the gang are about to shoot him in anger, they are all ambushed by Mike and his Deputies, who have found Karen. Mike, having lost reelection, now doesn't care any more about justice and intends to keep the money for himself, Wayne, Phil and Hank, who has now joined them from the dam.  Mr. Mehlor and Ray are killed in the shoot out, and Jim and Tom escape in a boat, finding sanctuary in the church. Wayne takes Karen back to her house, with the intention of raping her. The others try to force Tom and Jim out by throwing petrol bombs on the roof, but instead are forced to drive through the stained glassed windows. At Karen's house, Karen manages to stab Wayne with her penknife, killing him. In the church, a shoot out occurs, and at one point Tom and Phil come face to face, but Phil cannot bring himself to shoot him. Hank then shoots Phil, thinking he's a coward.  The dam overtopping alarm sounds, alerting the town that the dam is going to fail. Offering a deal, Mike says Tom and Jim should let Hank and him go with a couple of the moneybags. Tom agrees, yet Jim does not. Instead, Tom then leaves to try and save Karen, before Mike shoots Jim with a revolver he was hiding, although he isn't badly hurt. Mike and Hank escape in a boat and, when they are forced to go faster to avoid the wave engulfing the town, Mike pushes Hank out of the boat. He then dies after being caught in a gas explosion.   Tom arrives at Karen's house, to find her handcuffed to the banister. He first tries to free her with a saw, then uses Wayne's gun. The water is so high now they have to get onto the roof and are then caught by Mike. Jim, who managed to escape from the church, comes from behind them in a boat. Mike shoots at him, disabling the steering, forcing him to go over the roof. As he does so, the engine breaks off and collides with Mike, knocking him into the water. However, he is not dead and tries to shoot Karen as he grabs a moneybag, but Tom and Jim manage to shoot him dead. Tom tells Jim he should leave, just as the State Police arrive. Jim picks up the Mike's moneybag and rows away, as Tom tells Karen the fire damage to her church wasn't too bad, and it can be repaired.  
Harikrishnans

He Got Game
 Jake Shuttlesworth ([[Denzel Washington]]), is a convicted felon serving time at [[Attica Correctional Facility]] for the murder his wife, Martha ([[Lonette McKee]]), six years earlier. Jake meets with Warden Wyatt ([[Ned Beatty]]) and the two have a discussion about Jake's son, Jesus Shuttlesworth ([[Ray Allen]]), who has become the #1 high school basketball player in the nation and is being pursued by the top college basketball programs in the country. The governor of New York, who happens to be an influential alumnus of Big State University, offers Jake a deal: get Jesus to commit to playing for Big State in exchange for Jake's early release from prison. Jake is given one week's time and is temporarily released to make the deal, while being closely monitored by two officers assigned to Jake, Spivey ([[Jim Brown]]) and Crudup ([[Joseph Lyle Taylor]]). Jake, Spivey and Crudup travel to [[Coney Island, Brooklyn]], where Jesus is living. The officers place an ankle monitor on Jake with a fatal warning should Jake deviate from the plan or attempt to escape, and leave him in Coney Island to close the deal while they monitor his activities loosely.    On his first day out of prison, Jake contacts his daughter, Mary Shuttlesworth ([[Zelda Harris]]), who is happy to see him. Mary invites her father to the apartment where she and Jesus now live, having moved out of their Uncle Bubba's place. Jake and Mary use that time to catch up, while Mary questions why Jake has been released so soon from prison. As Jake and Mary reconnect, Jesus returns home from school, and is very cold towards Jake due to the strained relationship between Jesus (who resents his father for killing his mother) and Jake. Refusing to look him in the eye, he tells his sister to get rid of the "stranger" in their living room. Jesus later agrees to meet Jake at an alternative location away from Mary. Angrily, Jesus scolds Mary and takes her to their Uncle Bubba's, where they advise Uncle Bubba and Aunt Sally about Jake's release. Conflicted, Jesus asks Uncle Bubba ([[Bill Nunn]]) for advice; Uncle Bubba, however, wants reassurances from Jesus that him and Sally will be taken care of for taking in Jesus and Mary when Jake was sent to prison. This frustrates Jesus, as earlier, Coach Cincotta, Jesus' coach at [[Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn)|Abraham Lincoln High School]], was pressuring Jesus into a decision.  Jesus takes his cousin "Booger" Sykes ([[Hill Harper]]) with him to meet with Jake at the basketball court. Jake breaks the awkward tension by talking to Booger and connecting with him, going as far as to tell Booger that he grew since he saw him last, which disarms Booger and allows him to welcome Jake back. However, Jesus is resentful of Jake as Jake tries to find out how Jesus is doing, subtly looking to see what schools Jesus is looking at. Jake tries to figure out what school Jesus is attending for college (without telling him about the Big State deal with the governor), but Jesus advises he hasn't made a decision yet between school or declaring for the NBA draft, figuring that Jake is like everyone else, pressuring him into a decision or wanting something from Jesus. While Jake attempts to form a bond and remind Jesus that he is his father, Jesus still harbors bitterness towards Jake over his mother's death and his given name, going as far as to ask Jake when does he go back to prison, before leaving.  Throughout the week, the decision between attending college and fulfilling his mother's wishes versus declaring for the NBA draft in order to play professionally sooner and immediately lift himself and Mary out of poverty weighs on Jesus as he is constantly influenced by Jake, Uncle Bubba, his girlfriend Lala ([[Rosario Dawson]]) and even neighborhood stalwarts like Big Time Willie ([[Roger Guenveur Smith]]), who warns Jesus of leaches, women and other vices that will come to Jesus for a handout or to use him for money or fame. Coach Cincotta also tries to again get Jesus to commit, going as far as to bribe him with money. Jesus refuses the money, but Coach Cincotta reminds Jesus that he previously took the money, which helped set him and Mary up in their own apartment in the first place to get them away from Uncle Bubba. Jesus still refuses the money and leaves without being influenced. Jesus also gets agitated with Uncle Bubba, when Uncle Bubba purchases a luxury vehicle with the promise from the car dealership that Jesus will endorse them. Jesus demands that Uncle Bubba return the car.  Also during this time, Jake befriends Dakota Barns ([[Milla Jovovich]]), a prostitute who stays in the room next to Jake in the run-down hotel, which the warden has booked for him. Dakota is being abused by her procurer and companion, Sweetness ([[Thomas Jefferson Byrd]]). Jake overhears the violence through the thin walls. Throughout the week, Jake is seen helping clean Dakota's wounds, and Jake gives Dakota some of his money to be used for his expenses during his week out of prison. He also develops a romantic relationship with her, admitting that he hasn't been with anyone since his wife's death.   The tension between Jesus and Jake continues to build during the week, as Jake's reappearance effects Jesus and the animosity he holds toward his father. We also learn that Jesus has a shoebox filled with letters from Jake addressed to Jesus and Mary that are unopened while Jake has been in prison. A flashback shows the events that led to Jake's incarceration. One night, an intoxicated Jake pushes a young Jesus too hard on the basketball court while practicing, with Jake shoving Jesus and playing rough as a way to get his son to play better. Jake sees his overbearingness as a means to get him and his family out the projects one day, while Jesus views this as his father being rough on him and living vicariously through him. Eventually the practice comes to a head when Jake hard fouls Jesus during a game of one on one. Jesus, frustrated over Jake's demands, throws the basketball over the fence and leaves in disgust to go home. An enraged Jake, angry that Jesus lost the basketball, becomes overbearing to Jesus over dinner. When Jesus tries to leave the table, Jake confronts Jesus while Martha is trying to pull Jake off of Jesus. In a fit of rage, Jake tosses Jesus to the side and shoves Martha into the kitchen, where she fatally hits her head on the stove door. Jake tends to an unconscious Martha while instructing Jesus to call 9-1-1.  Jake meets with Jesus again on the pier and Jake explains the story of Earl Monroe, and how he got his nickname Jesus. Jake explains that Jesus got his name from Earl Monroe and not from the bible, illustrating his father's love and connection to basketball, something Jesus inherited. As Jesus and Jake are bonding, Jake informs Jesus that the governor let him out so that Jake can persuade Jesus to play for Big State. Jesus becomes angry at Jake for trying to use him and pressure him into a decision like everyone else has been doing. Jesus however tells Jake that Big State is in his top five choices, something Jake can live with. Jake continues to try and bond with Jesus, giving him a hug, but Jesus is still at-odds with Jake (and goes as far as to give Jake's gift of a stuffed bunny to a little girl).  Continually persuaded by Lala, Jesus agrees to meet with an agent, Dom Pagnotti ([[Al Palagonia]]) who's working with Lala's friend D'Andre ([[Leonard Roberts]]), and Dom tries to persuade Jesus to signing with him and declare for the NBA, going as far as to offer Jesus his Rolex watch as a gift. Jesus declines and decides to keep his options open before making a decision. While Jesus and Dom talk, Jesus notices Lala and D'Andre in the pool flirting. Jesus also attends a college visit from Tech University, meeting with potential teammates, coaches and enjoying the perks of being a top prospect (Jesus has a threesome with two women who are considered "assistant coaches" arranged by one of the players, Chick Deagan ([[Rick Fox]]) to help persuade Jesus to committing to the University).   While Jesus is out of town, Spivey and Crudup confront Jake on Jesus' trip out of town. Trying to get information, Jake goes to Jesus' school and runs into Lala. Jake confronts Lala with not having the best intentions for Jesus while Lala dismisses Jake. D'Andre arrives to pick up Lala and Jake accuses Lala of using Jesus. When D'Andre confronts Jake to defend Lala, Jake strikes D'Andre's throat and knocks him out in front of the school before leaving the scene before police arrive. An intoxicated Jake also confronts Booger about Jesus' whereabouts.  Jesus is suspicious of D'Andre and confronts Lala about it when he comes back into town. The two have an argument at the boardwalk. During the argument, Lala confronts Jesus over cheating on her while on college visits while Jesus accuses Lala of infidelity; it is revealed that Lala had an abortion, against her wishes, at Jesus' request due to them being young and the fear of college recruiters being potentially scared away from Jesus. Jesus reminds Lala that she was the one that pressured him to having unprotected sex in the first place. After questioning her into an answer, Lala admits that she has been sleeping with D'Andre and that she's been working with D'Andre and Dom to get Jesus to sign with them in order to look out for herself out of fear that Jesus will leave her for another woman once he goes off to college. Seeing that he was being used by Lala, Jesus breaks up with her.  Frustrated over his breakup with Lala and everyone around him, Jesus goes to the basketball court, where Jake runs into him. Out of time and out of options, Jake decides to play Jesus in a basketball game of one on one for high stakes: if Jake wins, Jesus signs the letter of intent that the governor provided Jake and Jesus will attend Big State University; if Jake loses, Jake will go back to Attica and remove himself from Jesus' life forever. Jesus immediately accepts the bet and the two battle on the court, with the first to ten winning. Jake immediately jumps out to a 3-0 lead, outplaying Jesus early while trying to impose some wisdom to his son in an attempt to connect. Jesus eventually gets furious when Jake scores again to a 4-0 lead and takes a lap around the court to mock Jesus. Jesus then proceeds to score four straight and tie the game 4-4, mocking Jake in the process. Jesus goes on to score the next six points, including emphatically dunking over a fallen Jake for the game point and the win, 10-4. Defeated, Jake retrieves the letter of intent for Big State and hands it to Jesus; a remorseless Jesus drops it on the ground in front of Jake, dismissing his father. Jake implores Jesus to get the hate out of his heart and not be like his father, attempting to reach his son one last time. Spivey and Crudup arrive to take Jake back to Attica, and they handcuff Jake in front of Jesus. Jake shares one final glance at his son before Spivey and Crudup take Jake back to prison. In the local newspaper, they report Jake's appearance in Coney Island as an prison escape.    During the press conference for Jesus' announcement, Coach Cincotta reads a statement that Jesus had prepared. Jesus advises that he declined to be in attendance, citing that he wanted to be with his family privately, before advising that he will attend Big State University. D'Andre and Lala can be seen in dismay over Jesus' decision while Big Time Willie is shocked that Jesus would pass on the money to go pro. In closing, Jesus sends his prayers to Jake in the letter. At home, Jesus decides to open one of Jake's letters that he held onto from prison, and Jake explains how proud he is of Jesus, finally getting through to his son.  Back in prison, Jake meets with Warden Wyatt again over the decision and Jake's parole. While the governor has not made a decision on Jake's early release, the governor got what he wanted with Jesus attending Big State, despite Jake being unable to get Jesus to sign the letter of intent. Dakota is seen in one of the final scenes taking a Greyhound bus away from Coney Island. Jake ultimately finds freedom by casting away his dreams and burdens to his son, Jesus, symbolized by the throwing of his old basketball over the prison wall and magically onto the Big State court where Jesus is practicing alone. Jesus clutches the ball, knowing it is a message of hope from his father.

Hercules and Xena – The Animated Movie: The Battle for Mount Olympus
  Long after [[Zeus]] stole the [[Cronus]] Stone from the monsters called the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] whom he also imprisoned in Tartarus, he and Alcmene gave birth to a son named [[Hercules]], who defeated two serpents (sent by a jealous Hera) at a young age and became a hero. After Hercules battles a sea serpent, the villagers thank him, and Iolaus climbs out of a restchair and joins him. Hercules and Iolaus head to Thebes to see Alcmene but Iolaus is a little upset because Hercules takes the credit. Meanwhile, [[Xena]] and [[Gabrielle (Xena: Warrior Princess)|Gabrielle]] reclaim the gold stolen by [[satyr]]s from a group of travelers in Corinth. [[Ares (Hercules and Xena)|Ares]] tells Xena to stop Hercules from going to Thebes because there is a trap set for him there, but Xena doesn't believe him and leaves with Gabrielle.  While tending to the crops, Hercules and Iolaus encounter Zeus, who takes Alcmene to Mount Olympus, much to Hercules' anger. After a brief argument, Iolaus and Hercules decide to rescue her from Mount Olympus. Back at Olympus, [[Hera]] hears about Alcmene's presence and confronts Zeus before stealing the Cronus Stone, the stone that keeps the Titans in the Underworld lava pits. She releases the Titans while Zeus checks on Alcmene, who has been shrunk and placed in a small Arabian doll house castle for safety from Hera. Meanwhile, [[Aphrodite (Xena and Hercules)|Aphrodite]] surfs down a mountain to warn Hercules of Hera's wrath if she sees him. Ignoring Aphrodite's warning, Hercules decides to continue on to Mount Olympus and Iolaus stays behind with Aphrodite. However, an earthquake begins (probably due to Hera messing up with the power of the Cronus Stone), and a small boy nearly falls into the lava pits, forcing Hercules to hold the faults while Iolaus goes to rescue the boy. Xena and Gabrielle, in a nearby town, gets into a fight with three thugs during the aftermath of the earthquake. After the boy is rescued, Hercules and Iolaus meet the Earth Titan [[Porphyrion]] as he emerges from the faults. Hercules tells Porphyrion that he can go free because he is not defending the gods, but warns Porphyrion that he should keep his fight against the gods away from the mortal world. Giving his word, Porphyrion heads over to Mount Olympus, signaling the other Titans to awaken. The Water Titan [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] arises from the water as the Fire Titan [[Mnemosyne]] emerges from the volcano and the fat Wind Titan [[Crius]] materializes from a tornado right in front of Xena and Gabrielle after they defeated the thugs. The Titans then gather to begin their revenge on the gods.  Zeus calls [[Artemis]], Aphrodite, and Ares together to fight the Titans and they hope Hercules will help them, unaware that Hercules has let one of them go out of hate against the gods. Xena and Gabrielle are helping wounded people and Artemis decides to get Xena's help and transforms Gabrielle into a [[Roc (mythology)|Roc]]. Xena flies on Gabrielle to the gods' home while Hercules climbs up. When Xena accuses Ares for what happened to Gabrielle, Artemis confessed the truth about her own actions, offering to turn Gabrielle back if Xena helps the gods fight the Titans.  Hercules shows up and rescues Alcmene and leaves everyone to fight the Titans. Hera transforms Ares, Aphrodite, Artemis and Zeus into a goat, a cow, a rabbit and a mouse, respectively. They are angry that Hercules did not help them to fight against the Titans, but he didn't care, considering the fact that he hated them because of the hardtimes they given for humanity. When Xena and Ioalus arrive, the former blames Hercules and his family for Gabrielle's fate and she confronts Artemis and learns that she can not turn Gabrielle or herself back due to the loss of her powers. Hercules finds out that Alcmene was sick and Zeus offered to make up for hardtimes by giving her immortality and taking her to live with him on Mount Olympus. Alcmene also confessed that she couldn't bear to tell Hercules about it because of his hatred of Zeus. Realizing his mistake, Hercules decides that it's for the best, as long as Alcmene is happy. Even Zeus starts to feel guilty for not being a little frank with Hercules, holding himself partially responsible for causing Hercules to hate the gods and deny his help back in Mount Olympus in the first place.  Hera scolds the Titans for wrecking [[Mount Olympus]] when they celebrate their victory against the gods. On Earth, Xena and Hercules reconcile and agree to help the gods get their home and the Cronus Stone back. Upon learning of the heroes' return (due to hearing Xena's battle cry), Hera uses the Cronus Stone to give the Titan more powerful forms and tries to force the Titans to do her bidding. However, Porphyrion strips the stone away from Hera (with the help from Crius) and deprive her of her powers by shrinking her into the dollhouse, declaring himself and the Titans as the new rulers. The heroes ride Gabrielle to the mountain and fight the Titans. Hercules gets the Cronus Stone and almost tears it apart which causes the Underworld caverns to open, allowing Xena to flip Crius into the pits and Iolaus to get Tethys and Mnemosyne to collide and dissolve into the fiery pits. However, Porphyrion, having inherited much of the power from the Stone before being separated from it, uses it to restrain Hercules, but is pulled into the air by Gabrielle, who then drops the Titan into the cavern. Gabrielle then drops Hercules off on the gods' mountain in time for him to close the stone, locking the Titans in the Underworld. The gods are then returned to their original forms while Hera remains trapped in the dollhouse as punishment, and Artemis turns Gabriele back to her original form as promised.  Back at Thebes, Alcmene is preparing to leave and return to Mount Olympus, and Zeus assures Hercules that he is welcome to meet them again anytime he wants. As Zeus and Alcmene leave for Mount Olympus, Hercules heads off with Xena, Iolaus, and Gabrielle to Corinth to return a bag of gold and seek another adventure.

Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows
   === Between two companies === As his contract nears expiration in March 1996, [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] Bret "Hitman" Hart was torn between two companies, World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) during the [[Monday Night Wars]]. On one hand, the WWF was his home. The chairman of the company, [[Vince McMahon]], is a father figure to Hart and takes credit for Hart's rise to international wrestling stardom. However, the company's new creative approach to marketing professional wrestling, the "[[The Attitude Era|WWF Attitude]]" marketing brand which relies on an emphasis on sex, extreme violence, and the replacing of heroic wrestling characters with disaffected [[anti-heroes]] in effort to compete against the already-popular WCW, has left Hart disillusioned.  [[Ted Turner]]'s WCW, on the other hand, was willing to pay him a great deal to "jump ship" as well as give him a fresh start in a company that offers a more wholesome approach. Hart chooses to remain loyal and signs a twenty-year deal with the WWF, despite the fact that WWF's ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'' is losing the Monday Night Wars to its rival ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]''. McMahon soon retracts the deal, and encourages Hart to move on to WCW, citing financial reasons. This leaves him with no choice but to take WCW President [[Eric Bischoff]]'s offer and prepare to leave the WWF. As the still-reigning WWF Champion, conflicts arise regarding his final match with the company, including Hart's unwillingness to drop the WWF Championship. To be more precise, Hart is not willing to lose the title to [[Shawn Michaels]], with whom he holds a bitter, real-life rivalry, in his home country of [[Canada]]. This leads to one of the most infamous events in professional wrestling as the [[Montreal Screwjob]].  This documentary is a rare look at professional wrestling behind the scenes. Examples include Hart discussing with The Undertaker and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] how matches will proceed, Bret's then wife, Julie, accusing [[Triple H]] of being in on the "screwjob", and the monstrous [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] discussing his recently acquired [[real estate]] license and future career plans.<ref></ref>  ''Wrestling with Shadows'' also gives a rare look at Hart's family life as well as the [[Hart House (Alberta)|Hart House]]—childhood home to Bret Hart as well as the rest of his extensive, wrestling-oriented family. Hart's mother, Helen, describes how she hates wrestling and has been wishing the family would abandon it for decades. Hart describes the role that wrestling has played in his life while footage is shown of his father, [[Stu Hart|Stu]], legitimately applying [[Professional wrestling holds|submission holds]] on a student of his basement — a notorious training room known as [[Hart Dungeon|The Dungeon]]. Hart's then wife, Julie, is also interviewed about the toll wrestling has taken on their relationship and raising four children. Hart is shown discussing with both his father and his wife the choice to stay with the WWF or move to WCW. In one instance, his frustration at his kitchen table leads him to ask the director to stop filming.  Other highlights of the documentary include interviews held in the [[Meadowlands Sports Complex|Meadowlands]] parking lot where the director asks slightly [[Drunkenness|intoxicated]] and incoherent wrestling fans their take on the ensuing America versus Canada feud, wherein one woman credits Bret Hart as her inspiration for going back to school for [[computer graphics]]. Another interviewee claims that Americans do not love their children when they cheer for [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] wrestlers like [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]. Another wrestling fan even shares beliefs that a strong connection lies between corporate America and the Undertaker/Bret Hart storyline. His words detail how Americans have to operate through a "by any means necessary" philosophy.  === Montreal Screwjob ===  The final act of the film sheds light on the events building up to [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series '97]] in which Hart put his WWF title on the line against Shawn Michaels. Hart is seen entering a private discussion with McMahon on how his final match will play out, which is heard on film due to Hart wearing a wire. They seem to find common ground and agree to a [[Professional wrestling#No contest|no contest]] or "schmozz". This result would then allow Hart to make a farewell speech the following night on ''Raw Is War'' and forfeit his WWF Championship.  Hart begins the match believing that it will end as he and McMahon agreed upon; midway through the bout, Michaels had Hart in a [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|sharp shooter]] (Hart's submission move) which Hart was in the process of escaping. However, McMahon comes to ringside and orders referee — and close friend of Hart — [[Earl Hebner]] to call for the ringside bell to be rung, signaling the end of the match. Hebner does so and declares Michaels the winner, stripping Hart of the title.  An enraged Hart spits on McMahon while Hebner, fearing for his safety, flees the building. Hart spells out "WCW" with his fingers to the shocked and confused crowd and smashes numerous ringside television monitors before storming backstage to confront Michaels and McMahon. Michaels feigns ignorance. During a closed-door confrontation with McMahon, Hart punches him in the face; Hart's then wife, believing that the incident was a conspiracy by the entire WWF roster, corners and confronts numerous wrestlers, most of whom appear bemused. A stunned, bruised McMahon staggers out of the building and Hart and his family leave. The film concludes with footage of Hart at home while on screen text details the immediate fallout of the screwjob.  
Hitman (1998 film)
 In [[Hong Kong]], a mysterious hitman known as the "Killing Angel" has murdered a wealthy ex-yakuza crime boss named Tsukamoto. Because Tsukamoto had established a revenge fund in case of an assassination, a $100 million bounty is placed upon the Killing Angel. The deceased's power hungry grandson, Eiji, becomes the new head of the Tsukamoto family and one of the bounty hunters.   An ex-soldier named Fu is part of a small gang that learns of the bounty. Fu attempts to enter the building where Tsukamoto's lawyers are discussing the terms of the revenge fund, but is rebuffed by the security. When he defends himself, his martial arts skills attract the attention of Lo, a seedy small-time criminal. Lo is also seeking the bounty on the King of Killers, and agrees to hire Fu as his muscle. They are warned not to pursue the case further by Inspector Chan, a member of the Hong Kong [[Security Bureau (Hong Kong)|Security Bureau]]. To test Fu's abilities, Lo takes on a small contract to kill a local gang member, while also outfitting Fu and allowing the ex-soldier to live in his home. Fu soon meets Kiki, Lo's daughter, who is a successful attorney and ashamed of her father's sleazy activities.  Martin, the head lawyer in charge of Tsukamoto's revenge fund, makes the discovery that prior to his death, the crime lord was forced to swallow old Chinese wartime [[Promissory note|promissory notes]]. He sells this information to the bounty hunters, and as Eiji is willing to pay the highest amount, he is the first to learn the serial codes on the notes. Fu and Lo follow Eiji to a small apartment complex, where they learn that the suspect is an old man named Uncle Leung, an acquaintance of Lo's that he had previously been searching for. Despite their best efforts fighting off multiple Yakuza hitmen and even an assassin disguised as a priest, Fu and Lo are unable to extract Leung, who suffers a heart attack and dies during their escape and is then shot in the head by Eiji.  Back at Lo's apartment, Lo comes clean with Fu: Years ago, he had met Uncle Leung, and in talking with him learned the old man was a veteran whose entire family was killed by the Japanese during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Now Leung wanted vengeance on his family's murderers, but the only wealth he possessed were the promissory notes. Taking pity on an old man, Lo told Leung to hold onto the notes and, in the event of the murder of the Japanese man he wanted dead, cash them in and forward the money to his bank account. Lo had only recently learned that Tsukamoto was the man Leung wanted to have killed, and once the crime lord had been assassinated by the King of Killers, Leung had done what Lo asked and forwarded the money from the notes to Lo's bank account. This had created a paper trail that implicated Lo as the Killing Angel.  Before Fu and Lo can plan further, their apartment is suddenly attacked by the bounty hunters. They are able to barely escape, and Lo makes plans to disappear to mainland China. Before they leave however, they decide to attend Kiki's wedding. At the event, Fu once again meets Inspector Chan and deduces that the agent is actually the real Killing Angel when he slips that he knows Lo is not really the wanted assassin. Fu and Lo then go to Eiji's penthouse to meet Martin, where Fu shoots Lo and demands to cash in on the bounty. Martin however informs them that Eiji has changed the terms of the fund so that no matter who kills the King of Killers, he will be the one who receives the money.  A massive fight ensues in the penthouse and soon Inspector Chan arrives as the Killing Angel to help Fu and Lo. They are able to kill Eiji and all of his men, leaving Martin to rewrite the terms of the fund. Later, they are seen together, dividing up the money and discussing their future plans. Chan retires, and recruits Fu to act as the new King of Killers.

Hitler (1998 film)
 Siddhant Sharma (Mithun Chakraborty), a senior prison official, is widely known as "Hitler" because of his rigid disciplinarian manner. At the prison he foils the planned escape of a gangster, arranged by his gang. He beats and then sacks a corrupt prison officer who was in on it.  At home Siddhant is equally authoritarian. His family are only able to relax when he is away at work. He is especially hard on his wayward brother Amar, who is unwilling to get a job and hangs around in the street.  In the street Amar sees a young woman, Priya, apparently being kidnapped. He rescues her from her comically incompetent attackers, only to discover that she had arranged it herself in order to get money from her father, a corrupt businessman. Priya and Amar fall in love. Meanwhile, gangsters try to bribe Siddhant into allowing the escape of the prisoner, but he will have none of it.  Daulatram, Priya's father, confronts Siddhant and accuses him of instructing Amar to woo Priya, so that the Sharma family can inherit his wealth. When Siddhant asks Amar to explain himself, Amar tells him that he and Priya are in love. Furious at Daulatram for embarrassing his brother, Amar confronts him threateningly, brandishing a knife in front of witnesses. The leader of gangsters, who is in conflict with Daulatram, sees what is happening. He takes the opportunity to kill Daulatram and frame Amar to get back at Siddhant.  Unknown to him, the phone has been left off the hook during a call to the police, leaving a taped recording of events on an answering machine at the police station.  After Daulatram is found stabbed to death, the police arrest Amar. Siddhant is convinced of his guilt, but his wife Sheila, a lawyer, refuses to believe it. She intends to defend Amar and discover the truth about Daulatram's murder. While she is investigating, she is injured in a road accident. When Amar learns of this, he escapes from the prison, pursued by his brother. He finds the gangsters, grabbing the sacked prison guard, but Siddhant has followed him. Siddhant shoots Amar, wounding him.  Siddhant is in anguish, but the tape recording is found by the police, exonerating Amar. Siddhant arrests the gangster leader. However, the gangsters make a doctored version of the tape, rearranging the conversation to implicate Amar. The gangster boss is released. He manages to capture Amar and Priya. When Siddhant comes to negotiate, the gangster reveals that Siddhant's whole family have been kidnapped and wired to explosives. He forces Siddhant and Amar to try to kill each other in a fight to the death. Siddhant allows himself to be apparently beaten, but in an athletic leap he grabs the detonator from the gangster leader.  Siddhant and Amar fight and defeat the gangsters, who are taken into custody.  Back at home with his family, Siddhant leaves behind his "Hitler" persona, and learns to relax, dancing to [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]".  
Home Fries (film)
 The film opens at Burger-Matic, where Henry Lever orders a milkshake at the drive-thru. At the window, he tells the attendant, Sally Jackson, that his wife knows about their affair. She asks him if he has also told his wife about her pregnancy. On his way home, he encounters a ferocious wind. It turns out to be an [[attack helicopter]], which runs him off the road. In a panic, he flees through the woods and drops his heart medication. At an outdoor chapel, he sits on a bench as the helicopter hovers in front of him. The pilot, Angus Montier, shoots at the ground near him despite the protests of his copilot and brother, Dorian. The shots scare him enough to cause a fatal heart attack.  Throughout their attack, Dorian and Angus can hear the chatter of Sally and her coworkers. Likewise, they can hear the helicopter pilots on their headsets. The next day, the police inform Beatrice Lever that Henry has died. She appears shocked and crestfallen, when Dorian and Angus arrive. It quickly becomes clear that she encouraged her sons to scare him to death. She is also furious about his affair, and wants revenge on his mistress. Angus and Dorian are worried that the people they heard on the radio might have overheard enough to connect them to his death. They quickly deduce that Burger-Matic is the only location close enough to have been on the same frequency. Angus goads Dorian into getting a job there to ensure that no one is wise to their crime.  Sally is heartbroken at the news about Henry. At work, Dorian bonds with her quickly. He gives her a model helicopter for her baby, and he explains that he and Angus fly them as [[reservists]] for the [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]]. She asks him to accompany her to [[lamaze]] class, since she doesn't have a partner. Eventually, he takes her to the base to see the helicopter that he flies. As she sits in the cockpit, she tells him about Henry.  Knowing that his mother is still furious about Henry's affair and that Angus would hurt Sally if he knew her identity, Dorian frantically tries to keep the truth from his family. When Angus discovers Sally's identity, Beatrice visits her under the pretense of making amends. Dorian is terrified of what Angus might do out of a misplaced loyalty to their crazy mother. Sure enough, he arrives at Sally's house in the attack helicopter. She, Dorian, and Beatrice escape in a truck. He eventually forces them to stop on the road. Beatrice pretends to be unaware of what is going on and leaves the truck. Dorian gradually convinces Angus to stop his attack.  The stress of the chase triggers Sally's labor, and Dorian drives her to the hospital. After she has a boy, he talks to him. He struggles to explain how they are related, and he tells him that he is lucky to have the best mother in the world.  
Hope Floats
 Birdee Pruitt ([[Sandra Bullock]]) is a Chicago housewife who is invited onto the Toni Post [[talk show]] under the pretense of getting a free makeover but instead is ambushed with the revelation that her husband Bill has been having an affair with her best friend Connie ([[Rosanna Arquette]]). Humiliated on national television, Birdee and her precocious only daughter Bernice ([[Mae Whitman]]) move back to Birdee's hometown of [[Smithville, Texas]], with Birdee's eccentric mother Ramona ([[Gena Rowlands]]) and her young, imaginative nephew Travis ([[Cameron Finley]]), to make a fresh start. As Birdee and Bernice leave Chicago, Birdee gives Bernice a letter from her father, telling Bernice how much he misses her.  Birdee struggles to make a new life as a working single mother and deals with the growing attraction between herself and a former high school classmate, Justin Matisse ([[Harry Connick Jr.]]), who Ramona hopes that Birdee will get together with. She also tries to rebuild her relationship with her estranged mother, her father (who has [[Alzheimer's Disease]]), and her daughter, who desperately wants to be with her father and grudgingly blames her mother for the breakup, even trying to sabotage the romantic overtures Justin makes towards Birdee. Meanwhile, Bernice is not very happy that she left Chicago and is having difficulty adjusting to her new life and school in Smithville. Her negative view of the small town is worsened when she is bullied by a classmate known as Big Dolores.  Adding to Birdee's heartache is her former status as the school [[Queen bee (subculture)|queen bee]] and a beauty pageant winner, which alienated many of her former classmates.  They also haven't forgotten Birdee's high school snobbery and rub her nose in her televised embarrassment.  Ramona tries to mend the gap between her daughter and granddaughter by telling a childhood story of her own.  She asks Bernice what she's wishing for her upcoming birthday. Even though Bernice says she doesn't have a birthday wish, she secretly wishes for her father to return.  That night, while drinking a cup of tea before she could sleep, Ramona suffers a massive heart attack and dies. Birdee's sister sends a telegram that she can't make the funeral and Travis wonders if Birdee will him raise him now. At the funeral, Bill arrives at the church. Bernice believes her father's presence at the funeral is a sign that her wish has come true... and that her father wants them both to come home. However, it soon becomes clear to her that her parents' split is permanent when Bill asks Birdee for a divorce.  Wanting to be with her father, Bernice runs up to her room, packs a suitcase, and follows Bill to his car. She is devastated when her father tells her that even though he loves her and promises to come back for her, he has no room for her in his new life with Connie right now.  Bill turns his back on Bernice and drives off, leaving her sobbing and screaming for him to come back and take her with him at the end of the driveway. Birdee comes to pick Bernice up and carries her back into the house. As Birdee comforts Bernice up in her bedroom, Bernice says she knows the letter was actually written by her mother, and not really by her father.  One day at work, Birdee finds Justin outside waiting for her with flowers. As she walks to him, she says, "Ok, Mama, stop pushing". After they kiss and embrace, he picks her up, places her in his truck and they drive off together.  The final scene shows Birdee, Justin, Bernice, and Travis at a big town event. Birdee has now taken full custody of Travis and is also dating Justin, but she's still not planning on getting married again for a really long time. Bernice embraces Smithville as her new hometown, ultimately accepts Bill's departure from her life as a full-time parent, and begins to accept Justin as her mother's new love interest and a father figure.  She and Birdee are much closer because of everything they've been through, as Bernice finally realizes it wasn't her mother's fault that her father left them and that Birdee really did love her. They share a tender, yet humorous moment when Bernice asks Birdee if she's going to marry Justin. When Birdee asks her if she doesn't like Justin, Bernice says her only real concern is being known as "Bernice Matisse".

However, John has given Ricky an ultimatum to increase sales, or lose his job.   While out driving one day, Ricky and Kate come across a [[charisma]]tic strange man who calls himself "G" (Eddie Murphy). G is unusual in that he wears white robes and is perpetually happy and smiling. He seems to sense how troubled Ricky is, and follows them back to the Good Buy studio. G wanders onto the set of an [[infomercial]], and while he is on the air, the number of calls with customers wanting to buy something increases. Kate notices this and gets G his own spot on the network selling items. Meanwhile, the mutual dislike between Ricky and Kate fades and they begin to express romantic interest in each other.   G's infomercials are mostly spontaneous anecdotes or thoughts about life, but customers connect with him and even the slowest-moving items begin selling out. While staying at Ricky's house, he enters a party of businessmen and displays his talents by making a [[Rolex]] watch "disappear" and curing another man of his fear of flying. Ricky begins marketing G's name on other items to increase sales. He wants to give G his own show, but the stressful work environment and throngs of fans who want to meet him begin to take its toll. G is no longer the happy, inspiring man he once was, and when Kate tries to convince John to let G leave the network, he refuses and she quits out of contempt. Ricky reaps the benefits of the increased sales, receiving a large promotion and a new office. However, the rewards seem hollow due to G's lethargy and Kate's rejection of him.  On the night of the premiere of G's new show, Ricky searches himself and decides that letting G go is the right choice. He announces his decision live on air to the studio audience and to his boss. Kate hears of his decision and forgives Ricky, racing back to the studio to be with him. They have a romantic reunion on the air, and the show is ended.

Humdrum
  The film features two anonymous Scottish-accented [[Shadow play|Shadow Puppets]] (voiced by [[Jack Docherty]] and [[Moray Hunter]]) who are sitting around a table with nothing to do. They explore and reject several options including watching television (the only thing on is 'some weird animation thing'), listening to the radio (but 'it's all the same rubbish these days' - in this case [[La Cucaracha]]) and playing chess (the white pieces have been eaten due to a bet). This is briefly interrupted when the doorbell rings and one character answers it to find a pesky dog (who is, in fact, a double-glazing salesman) before the other persuades him to enter into a game of shadow puppets. The first character is frustrated by his acquaintance's appalling representation of a [[cow]] and later his failure to recognise a rather fantastic [[rabbit]] (His misled guesses include a 'fireman chasing an igloo' and an 'Otter with two sausage strapped to his head'). After an amusing outburst from the poor fellow, his annoying partner accuses him of being 'shirty'. This leads him to explode, furiously crying "I'm stuck indoors playing 'Guess the misshapen beast' with someone who clearly wouldn't recognise a rabbit if it came to his house for tea, said '[[Bugs Bunny|What's up Doc?]]' and started burrowing into his head! There are blind people with no fingers who are better at shadow puppets than you! No wonder I'm a tad miffed!" An awkward silence follows this, until the doorbell rings and the first character goes to answer it, and finds the second character's 'cow' shadow puppet, which moos. Despite being disappointed with being wrong about a cow's appearance, he simply responds to this with a cheery "Not today, thank you." and closes the door in front of the camera, thus ending the animation.

I Still Know What You Did Last Summer
  [[I Know What You Did Last Summer|One year after the events of the first film]], Julie James is attending summer classes in [[Boston]], to avoid returning to her hometown of [[Southport, North Carolina]]. She suffers from [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|memories and nightmares]] of the accident and brutal murders of her friends by the vengeful fisherman, Ben Willis, from the summer before.   Julie's roommate Karla Wilson receives a phone call from a local radio station, and wins an all-expenses-paid vacation to [[the Bahamas]] for the [[Fourth of July]] weekend. Julie invites her boyfriend, Ray Bronson. He declines, but later changes his mind and plans to show up as a surprise and propose.  That evening, Ray and his co-worker Dave drive to Boston to meet Julie. They stop due to a BMW and body in the middle of the road. Ray discovers that the body is a mannequin dressed in fisherman's clothing. Suddenly, Ben Willis appears and kills Dave with his hook. Ben takes Ray's truck and chases him down the road. Ray gets away, but he is injured from falling down a hill.  The next morning, Julie and Karla depart on the trip with Karla’s boyfriend Tyrell and their friend, Will Benson. The group arrives at the hotel in Tower Bay, only to find that other guests are leaving due to the imminent [[hurricane]] season. To her surprise, Julie is sharing a hotel room with Will. That evening at the hotel’s bar, Julie is talked into singing [[karaoke]]. She stops when the words “I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER” roll onto the screen. Terrified, she runs back to her room and is met by Will, who laid out flowers and a love note for her. Julie sidesteps Will's affection for her, while Tyrell and Karla (and later Will) get into the hot tub.  Julie notices that her toothbrush is missing. She searches the room and finds the dockhand Darik hanging dead in the closet. She finds Tyrell, Karla, and Will, but when they return there is no sign of Darick's body. The hotel manager refuses to believe her story and Julie tries to call the police, but the phone lines are dead due to the incoming hurricane. Ben arrives at the hotel and kills the employees.   The following day, the group finds that the hotel staff and the manager have been murdered, and the [[two-way radio]], their only way of contact, has been destroyed. Isolated, Julie tells the others about the previous summer. Tyrell suspects that Estes, the boat hand porter, is the killer, since he is the only one who cannot be found. The group goes to Estes’ apartment, searching for clues. They find Julie’s toothbrush and Karla's hair tie, concluding Estes has been using [[Black magic#Voodoo|voodoo]] to protect them. Estes appears and leads them to a graveyard in the forest with the graves of Ben's wife and daughter, and an empty grave and tombstone with Julie’s name. Estes explains that Ben and his wife Sarah had two children: son Will and daughter Susie. Ben murdered Sarah in the hotel room that Julie is staying in when he found out about her affair and her plans to leave him with their children.   Estes goes missing, and Will volunteers to find him. Julie, Karla, and Tyrell return to the hotel and gather supplies to defend themselves.  They head to the hotel kitchen for something to eat, and find Nancy, the bartender, hiding in the freezer. Will finds Estes, but he attacks Will while Ray takes a boat to the island. Ben appears and stabs Tyrell in the throat with his hook, killing him. The girls retreat to the attic, where Karla is attacked by Ben. They both fall through to the hotel bedroom below. Karla runs from the room and jumps onto the greenhouse. Julie and Nancy rescue Karla and run to the storm cellar to take refuge. They find that the storm cellar stores Ben's victims. Will bursts in and convinces the girls to head back to the hotel, stating that he saw Ben on the beach.  Back at the hotel, Julie sees Will is bleeding from his stomach, so Nancy takes Karla to find a [[first aid kit]]. Nancy and Karla find Estes has been impaled with a [[harpoon]]. Ben appears and kills Nancy. Back in the lobby, Julie is tending to Will, unable to find a wound. Will admits this is because it is not his blood. He asks Julie what her favorite radio station is, revealing he was the radio host and killed Estes. Will drags Julie to the graveyard, and tells her he is Ben's son. Ben appears and attacks Julie. Ray arrives, and a fight ensues between him and Will. When Ben tries to stab Ray, he accidentally kills Will instead. While Ben is distraught from killing his son, Julie takes a gun and shoots him in the chest. Ben falls dead into the grave made for Julie. Back at the hotel, Karla is found alive. The three are rescued by the [[coast guard]].  Sometime later, Ray and Julie have married and are in their new home. Ray is brushing his teeth before bed and Julie is in their bedroom. The bathroom door is quietly shut and locked while Ray is occupied. Julie sits down on her bed, looks in the mirror, and sees Ben under the bed. She screams as Ben grabs her feet with his hook and hand and pulls her under leaving her fate unknown.

I, Zombie
 The film opens in mockumentary style with a woman, Sarah, talking about her boyfriend Mark in the past tense.  Mark skips Sarah's event for his research field trip, and she is very displeased with his decision. Mark travels out to the woods to collect moss samples when he stumbles across a rusty decaying station wagon. Intrigued, he continues down the path and eventually finds an abandoned farmhouse. He enters the house, explores the rooms, and stumbles across an injured man propped up against a wall.  When he hears a woman scream, he rushes to her aid and finds her having a seizure on a dirty mattress. He brushes her hair out of her face to comfort her and sees that she has the same sort of scars and deformities that the man had. He picks her up and carries her outside, and she bites his neck. He promptly drops her and runs away, eventually collapsing in a nearby field.  Back at home, Sarah calls an investigator to report Mark missing for three weeks. Mark wakes up, thinks to himself about how he doesn't know how long he's been unconscious, and admits to killing his first victim, a camper in the woods. He recalls how he had no control of the situation. He decides he has to hide and rents a new apartment. He looks at his bite wound in a mirror and notices it is beginning to look worse. He collapses, suffers a minor seizure, and reports it in his digital log, along with how he has not eaten in six days and has to find another victim.  As his condition worsens, he begins to accept and study it, keeping everything recorded in logbooks or his digital recorder. He still appears normal and continues to live and function in society, although his bite wound will not heal and the surrounding tissue is starting to decay. He picks up a hitchhiker, knocks him out with chloroform, and eats most of the man's chest. He then burns the man's body and possessions.  Meanwhile, Sarah begins seeing another man named David. Late one night after a date, someone rings her doorbell, but she sees no one. Mark attacks her with chloroform and brings her back inside her apartment to look at her one last time. Mark continues on his hunting spree as his appearance slowly becomes more ghastly and his behavior more erratic. He begins losing a lot of weight and becomes weaker. His leg breaks during the disposal of a victim's body, and he is forced to attach a metal rod to support his ankle. Mark also begins to lose his grip on reality and suffers from hallucinations. His decomposition becomes so severe that he can no longer bear to look at himself, so he overdoses with a bottle of chloroform.  
I Stand Alone (film)
 The history of the Butcher, who doesn't have any other name, is narrated through voice-over and a montage of still photographs. Orphaned at a young age, he was sexually abused by a priest. As a teenager, unable to have the opportunity to study and learn a profession of his choice, he reluctantly embraces the career of butcher specializing in horse meat, a profession already frowned upon at the time in France.  After several years of hard work, he's finally able to open his own horse meat butcher shop, and his girlfriend gives birth to a daughter. But when the woman realizes the infant is not a boy, she leaves the young father alone with the child. Embracing it as fate, the Butcher decides to take care of his daughter alone. But as loneliness grows on the single father, he becomes overprotective and develops incestuous feelings for his child. When he sees blood on her skirt, he stabs the man who he thinks raped his daughter. He later understands that the stains were only menstrual blood. He is sentenced to prison and forced to sell his shop to a Muslim butcher, and his troubled daughter is sent to an institution.  In prison, the Butcher has sex with a cellmate. Upon his release, he vows to forget it all happened. He finds a job working as a bartender for the woman who owns the tavern where he was a regular customer. They begin dating, and soon she becomes pregnant. As they start making plans for their future together, she sells her business and they move to northern France, where she said she would buy a butcher shop for him.  There, she backs out of her promise. He has to take a night watchman job at a nursing home, where he meets a young and caring nurse, the complete opposite of his aging, careless mistress. As he and the nurse witness together an elderly patient die, the Butcher thinks back about the lack of affection throughout his life, from the orphanage to a life with a careless mistress who abuses the power she has over him because of her money. When she unjustly accuses him of having an affair with the nurse, he snaps and punches her in the belly several times, very likely killing their unborn child, then steals a pistol and flees.  He decides to return to Paris, where he rents the same [[flophouse]] room where he conceived his daughter, and begins looking for a job as a horse meat butcher. But the customers' taste changed during his time in prison, provoking a collapse of the horse meat market. Despite his patience, his job interviews consistently end up with rejection. He then proceeds to broaden his job search, but in general butchery he's considered an unskilled worker. He has to start all over again at the bottom, which he does, not long before being fired for being too old for the position.  He starts looking outside his branch, but the more he broadens his searches, the more humiliating the job interviews become. He remains polite, but the more desperate he becomes, the more quickly he's rejected by managers. When he turns to his old friends for advice, they all reject him. After being turned away at a slaughterhouse that once did business with his shop, the Butcher decides to kill the slaughterhouse manager. He plots the murder at a local tavern, but is ejected from the bar at gunpoint after squabbling with the owner's son. The Butcher finds that he has only three bullets in his gun, and begins assigning them to the men he feels have humiliated him the most.  More and more isolated, he decides to look for the only person he feels has ever loved him, his daughter. After meeting her at the asylum in which she is a patient, he takes her back to his room where he's prey to opposite feelings towards her. As he's about to lose his sanity, he contemplates having sex with his daughter, before killing her. After the representation of this fantasy, the movie returns to the moment of the Butcher's hesitation. He decides to put the gun away, resolving to be good, and tearfully embraces his daughter. But he starts again to contemplate having sex with her, in the same manner he did with her mother.  Standing at a window, he unzips his daughter's jacket and begins fondling her. As he starts to abuse his daughter, the Butcher, between more and more incoherent thoughts, tries to justify his act by asserting that the world condemns his love for his daughter only because it is too powerful.

Hurricane Streets
 14-year-old Marcus Frederick ([[Brendan Sexton III]]) resides in [[Lower East Side|Manhattan’s Lower East Side]] with his grandmother, Lucy ([[Lynn Cohen]]). His mother, Joanna ([[Edie Falco]]), has spent the last nine years of Marcus's life in prison for [[Illegal immigration|smuggling undocumented aliens]] into [[New Mexico]]. Presumably, Marcus’s father died in a car accident when Marcus was five.  Lucy owns and operates her own establishment called Lucy’s, where she works as a bartender, giving Marcus a lot of unsupervised time to spend  with his four friends Chip (David Roland Frank), Benny ([[Carlo Alban]]), Louis (Mtume Gant), and Harold (Antoine McLean). The group spends the majority of their time committing [[Shoplifting|petty theft]] and hanging around in their underground clubhouse near the waterfront. Chip has grown tired of the small-time crime and wants to move into more serious theft, such as [[robbery]].<ref></ref>   Marcus has aspirations to move back to his home state of New Mexico and live on a ranch with his uncle Billy who had promised to mail Marcus an airplane ticket. However, Lucy doesn't believe Billy was being serious.  Later that day, Marcus sells stolen merchandise to children during recess at the local elementary school while Chip serves as a lookout. There, Marcus meets 14-year-old Melena ([[Isidra Vega]]). Marcus invites Melena to his fifteenth birthday party, although she declines claiming her abusive father, Paco ([[Shawn Elliott]]), a tow truck driver, doesn’t approve of her staying out late.  That night, Melena sneaks out of her apartment and meets Marcus in front of the bar where she gives him her ski mask as a gift before leaving. The next morning, Marcus receives the flight ticket to New Mexico in the mail and relays this information to Lucy. Mack ([[L.M. Kit Carson]]), a regular patron at the bar, reveals to Lucy he actually sent Marcus the ticket (under the guise of Billy) believing it would do Marcus good if he left the city.   Marcus, Benny, and Louis are subsequently introduced to Justin (Damian Corrente) and Shane ([[David Moscow]]), Chip’s drug dealing friends from [[Miami]]. Marcus tells Melena about his plans to move to New Mexico and offers her to join him. Melena declines, knowing her father would never approve and not being able to afford the price of the ticket.  Afterwards, Marcus gets caught by a [[Undercover operation|plainclothes officer]] named Kramer ([[Jose Zuniga]]) after he continues to sell stolen merchandise to the elementary school children and is hauled off to the police station. Marcus is interrogated by Kramer and another detective named Hank (Richard Petrocelli) who threaten to charge him with [[Burglary|commercial burglary]] and inform him that his mother is in prison for [[murder]], not [[Illegal immigration|smuggling undocumented aliens]] like she had told him (it is implied  that Joanna killed his father.)  Marcus visits his mother and tells her about his meeting with Melena and the two of them planning to travel to New Mexico. Marcus then reveals that he knows she’s in prison for killing his father. Joanna explains that his father was abusive towards her and Marcus and didn’t know how to tell Marcus without him being upset. She also admits that she isn’t up for parole until another four years, but promises Marcus they will go to New Mexico once she is out. Marcus is clearly done with her promises and leaves.  Later, Marcus returns to the clubhouse where he is surprised by Mack who is a wanted [[fugitive]] hiding out from the police. Marcus sympathetically gives his ticket to Mack in hopes that it will help him with his dilemma. The following day, Marcus tells Melena and friends his decision to remain in [[New York (state)|New York]] in order to straighten his life out.   At the clubhouse, the group reveals to Marcus they plan on breaking into a policeman's (Leslie Body) apartment and stealing his valuables. Marcus refuses to get involved after his run-in with the police. Paco drives to the clubhouse’s location where Melena and Marcus congregate regularly. When Paco starts to get rough in disciplining Melena, Marcus intervenes before Paco shoves him into the lake and leaves with Melena. A vengeful Marcus rides his bicycle to Melena’s apartment building and coldcocks Paco.   Marcus and Melena leave and camp out in a tent for the day. They plan to meet at [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] at noon the next day to catch the train after coming to a consensus that they will travel to New Mexico. In order to procure the amount of money it costs for the train fare, Marcus joins his friends in the robbery plot.   In the apartment, Harold finds and secretly steals the officer’s gun before the group departs and returns to the clubhouse. Meanwhile, in his search for Melena, Paco sneaks inside the clubhouse and looks around. When he hears the group approaching, he hides in the closet.   Chip insults Harold’s ability to play darts which results in Harold pulling out the stolen gun and shooting the target on the dartboard to show off. Unknowingly, Harold has shot and killed Paco (through the closet door the dart board was hanging on) whose corpse falls from the closet. Unable to lift the body, Marcus takes the keys to Paco’s [[tow truck]] from his pocket, and uses the crane on the tow truck to lift Paco and release him into a shallow grave. Harold feels guilty and Marcus fears that he may go to the police. He warns Benny to not let Harold talk before telling him he changed his mind and he is resuming his plans to go to [[New Mexico]], though promises he’ll return in two weeks.   On the day Marcus and Melena are supposed to leave for New Mexico, Marcus visits the ruins of a building where he keeps a hidden stash of cash, only to find that it’s missing along with the loot from the robbery. While Marcus is riding his bicycle downtown, he notices Chip showing off his brand new [[Diamondback Bicycles|Diamondback bicycle]] to a crowd of onlookers. Marcus punches him in the face, accusing Chip of stealing the [[robbery]] loot and his stash of cash to pay for the bike. Justin and Shane accost Marcus before Justin reveals he stole Marcus’s money. Justin, Shane, and Chip then mercilessly beat Marcus to the ground before leaving.   Immediately after, Marcus returns to the clubhouse and takes the gun before noticing an unmarked car and police cruiser pull up and it’s revealed that Benny had reported Paco’s murder to the police. Meanwhile, two police officers question Lucy on Marcus’s whereabouts. Soon after, Chip is arrested by the police.   Running out of time and desperate for cash, Marcus [[Armed robbery|enters a convenience store and holds the cashier, Duane, at gunpoint]]. Duane ([[Terry Alexander (actor)|Terry Alexander]]) hands over the cash and Marcus promises to pay him back. Marcus races to [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] where he reunites with Melena. The two board the train and Melena, not knowing her father is dead, remarks that her dad is going to kill her when he finds out she ran away. Marcus, knowing full well Paco won’t be able to anything of the sort, doesn’t respond.

When he awakens, he sets off to track down everyone present at the funeral in an attempt to find his cash, killing anyone who gets in his way.  
The Idiots
 A seemingly anti-[[bourgeois]] group of adults spend their time seeking their "inner [[Idiot (usage)|idiot]]" to release their inhibitions. They do so by behaving in public as if they were [[Developmental disability|developmentally disabled]].   At a restaurant, patrons are disturbed by the group's mischief, but single diner Karen develops an appreciation of their antics. The members of the group refer to this behaviour as "spassing", a [[neologism]] derived from "spasser", the Danish equivalent of "[[Spastic|spaz]]." Karen takes a ride in a taxi cab with the people from the restaurant, and she finds herself at a big house. The apparent leader of the group, Stoffer, is supposed to be selling the house (which belongs to his uncle), but instead it becomes the focal point for group activities.  The "spassing" is a self-defeating attempt by the group to challenge the establishment through provocation. The self-styled idiots feel that the society-at-large treats their intelligence uncreatively and unchallengingly; thus, they seek the uninhibited self-expression that they imagine a romantic ideal of disability will allow.  Stoffer, at his birthday party, wishes for a "[[Group sex|gangbang]]", and both clothes and inhibitions are soon discarded. Then when Stoffer calls for the group members to let idiocy invade their personal daily lives, Karen takes up the challenge. She takes Susanne back to her house, where they are greeted by surprise by Karen's mother. Karen had been missing for two weeks, following the death of her young baby; she offers no explanation of where she has been. Karen attempts to spaz in front of her family by dribbling the food she is eating, but this results in a violent slap from her husband, Anders. Karen and Susanne leave the house.

Jake reconsiders following the deal with his father and trades the tickets back in for New York and Allie agrees to ride with him.  Eddie Taffet ([[Adam LaVorgna]]), Jake's nemesis and rival for Allie's affections, and his trio of goons leave Jake in the desert dressed as [[Santa Claus]] as a punishment for not getting an exam cheat sheet (a deal Jake was going through with that Eddie secretly sabotaged on purpose). While Jake is stuck in the California desert, Eddie ends up giving a reluctant Allie a ride to New York after she thinks Jake has bailed on her once again.  Jake has only three days to make it to Larchmont if he wants the car. He stumbles upon Nolan ([[Andrew Lauer]]), a simple-minded thief who is driving stolen kitchen goods to his dealer near New York. A police officer named Max ([[Sean O'Bryan]]) pulls them over in [[Red Cliff, Colorado]] for speeding, so Jake lies and says that Nolan is his elf, Snowpuff, and that they are donating the goods to the children's hospital. The police officer offers for them to join him. Max asks Jake to accompany him to [[North Platte, Nebraska]] and help him win his wife, Marjorie (Lesley Boone), back.   Allie and Eddie continue to head for New York. Allie convinces Eddie to stay the night at novelty hotel in a [[Bavaria]]n village, the [[Amana Colonies]] in [[Middle Amana, Iowa|Amana, Iowa]]. Allie and Eddie are unknowingly standing beneath mistletoe when a news anchor is reporting live. Jake sees Allie and Eddie kiss whilst waiting at the bus station in [[Nebraska]].  Jake wants to stop at the Bavarian village and develops a scheme to convince the bus driver. He obtains a cooler, a slab of meat, writes Allie's name and address on the cooler, and then convinces the whole bus that the cooler needs to be delivered to a little girl at the hospital in the Bavarian village for a transplant. After Allie lets Jake into the room, Eddie walks out of the shower in only a towel and Jake assumes he has slept with Allie. Jake and Allie make up until Jake blurts out that Eddie prevented him from getting home by 6 p.m. Upset that Jake cares more about the car than her, Allie storms onto the bus and takes Jake's seat.  Jake and Eddie drive off. Eddie suddenly becomes jealous realizing that Jake will not only get Allie, but also the Porsche, throws Jake out of his car somewhere in [[Wisconsin]]. Jake decides to enter a [[Santa Claus]] race for a chance to win a $1,000 prize to buy an airline ticket to New York. Eddie is arrested after insulting two cops policing the race dressed as [[Christmas tree]]s (possibly doing more than that). While registering for the race, Jake meets a nice man named Jeff Wilson, who he barely beats in the race. But on his way to the airport, the taxi driver informs Jake that Jeff is actually the mayor of the town who usually wins the race every year and uses the prize money to buy turkeys for the needy. Jake feels bad, and gives the money to the Mayor.   Jake talks to his sister, who arranges for an airline ticket for Jake from [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. The airline refuses to allow Jake to board the aircraft because he has no photographic identification. Jake decides to stow away in a dog kennel on a cargo aircraft. From the airport, he hides on a train, tries to hitch a ride in a car, then steals a one-horse open sleigh from the local parade. When he reaches his street, he apologizes to Allie and they make up. Jake rides the sleigh home and arrives at 5:59 p.m. Jake intentionally waits until after 6 p.m. to go inside so that he will not arrive in time to get the Porsche. When Jake's father offers him the Porsche anyway, he still refuses. Jake finally accepts his stepmother. The Wilkinsons and Allie get in the sleigh just as the parade arrives and join the procession.

I've Been Waiting for You (film)
 Sarah Zoltanne ([[Sarah Chalke]]) is a teenager who recently moved from [[Los Angeles]] to Pine Crest with her mother, Rosemary ([[Markie Post]]). Always having been an outsider, she is not very welcomed by her classmates at school. Especially the popular group (who call themselves the 'Descendants Club,' as they are the children of the town's oldest families), including Kyra Thompson ([[Soleil Moon Frye]]), Eric Garrett ([[Christian Campbell]]), Debbie Murdock ([[Maggie Lawson]]), Kevin Lane (Chad Cox), and Misty (Julie Patzwald) are rude to her, criticizing her unusual clothes and attitude. She also meets Charlie Gorman ([[Ben Foster]]), who is considered the school geek because he also doesn't quite fit in and works in a family owned occult bookstore. Sarah and Charlie get along fairly well. Sarah is soon bothered with phone calls from a mysterious person, saying "I've been waiting for you." Being a supporter of [[wicca]], she isn't very worried.  Later on, Kyra and Eric, who are a couple, break into her house and tell her the house was inhabited by Sarah Lancaster ([[Laura Mennell]]) in 1698, a young woman who was in love with a man who was already engaged to another woman. According to Kyra, Sarah later lost her mind and was put into a mental hospital. Not much later, the man she was in love with died, along with his fiancée. The townspeople thought that Sarah's ghost was responsible, and [[Death by burning|burned her at the stake]] following the accusation of [[witchcraft]]. Before dying, Sarah Lancaster casts a curse that has been passed down through the town's history, which indicates she may return for revenge:  ''5 descendants in a row,''  ''Generations yet to know.''  ''Powers cast their fiery glow,''  ''secrets only witches know.''  Kyra and Eric then persuade her to participate on a [[Practical joke|prank]], pretending to be a psychic at a party, which she agrees to. At the party, Sarah is given a microphone, so Kyra can secretly provide her all the secrets of her customers, however, after Kyra leaves the microphone unattended, an unknown person gives Sarah disturbing information about Debbie (that she has been sleeping with Eric, who is Kyra's boyfriend) and Misty, revealing the abusive relationship of her parents. Misty freaks out and leaves the party in anger. While driving home, she is attacked and scared to death by a masked killer using a glove in which long, spiked protrusions have been attached. Before she dies, she hears the killer whisper "I've been waiting for you." The next day, upon hearing the news, the popular group immediately suspect Sarah for the murder, thinking that she might be the reincarnation of Sarah Lancaster, coming back for revenge on the descendants of the people responsible for burning her. Sarah insists that the information was given to her by Kyra, but Kyra states that she set the microphone down and has proof that she was elsewhere (with Eric).  Soon, other people of the Descendants Club are targeted by the masked killer, each hearing the same phrase whispered before or during the attack; "I've been waiting for you." Kevin is attacked while in the school locker room and is killed, but both Eric and Debbie are able to escape their attacks, Debbie sustaining a beauty-marring injury to her face. Charlie is also targeted, barely escaping a fire set by the masked killer in his bookstore, and when Sarah questions why he would be (since the attacker seems only to be targeting the descendants), he reveals to her that he is actually also a descendant, but that the others are unaware of this. Although they had been working together to unravel the mystery of the killer, Charlie feels that he must back off from his friendship with Sarah, unsure about whether she is or is not behind the attacks. Meanwhile, the popular group are certain that Sarah is responsible, and to save their own lives, they decide that they must burn her. Eric, pretending to be interested in taking Sarah on a date, lures her to his SUV, only to tie her up with help of Debbie and Kyra. They take her to a clearing with wooden poles and tie her to one with the intention of burning her at the stake for witchcraft.  Trying to distract them long enough to escape or talk sense into them, she begins to tell them all the information she has been gathering about the descendants and their families, informing them that there is actually a 6th descendant that they are unaware of (Charlie). She also reveals that Debbie has slept with Eric, which makes Kyra angry enough to turn on Debbie. While they are accusing each other, with Sarah insisting it isn't either of them, they are attacked by the masked killer. Sarah is able to get free and, after a struggle, they are able to overpower the killer. When they unmask him, it turns out that Charlie is the killer, having made the glove in shop, during school. Before he is arrested, he reveals that his mother was a descendant, as well, but she was driven out of town by the other families when she turned up pregnant, but was unmarried. His attacks were actually revenge for the townspeople driving his mother away, and had nothing to do with the legend of Sarah Lancaster.  Later, when Sarah returns home, Ted Rankin ([[Tom Dugan (American actor)|Tom Dugan]]), their history teacher who has been dating Sarah's mother, Rosemary, is revealed to also be involved in the murders; it is implied that Charlie may have been his illegitimate son, but this is never confirmed because, after attacking Sarah's mother and being overpowered by Sarah, he leaves town and cannot be located.  A month later, Sarah is settling into the town and her place at school. She is dating Eric and seems to be adjusting, normally. As she waits for Eric to meet her, Sarah visits the grave of Sarah Lancaster, and while clearing it free of leaves and debris, her voiceover states that Sarah Lancaster had indeed returned, but that some methods were better than others for dealing with revenge and that the townspeople had been relaying the curse incorrectly all these years; she repeats it while kneeling over Sarah Lancaster's grave:  ''6 descendants in a row,''  ''Generations yet to know.''  ''Powers cast their fiery glow,''  ''secrets only witches know.''  And then states, quietly, with a mysterious smile. "Two down... 4 to go."  Eric arrives and, while hugging him, she whispers in his ear, "I've been waiting for you...."

Incognito (1998 film)
 Talented New York painter Harry Donovan is an expert of copying famous artists' paintings, but is struggling to become a legitimate artist in his own right. Until now, he has avoided detection by forging third and fourth tier masters, but that is about to change. Frustrated by the cancellation of an exhibition of his paintings, Harry accepts a job forging a long lost [[Rembrandt]] for $550,000 from three art dealer clients—Alistair Davies (Thomas Lockyer), Ian Hill, and Agachi—against the wishes of his artist father who wants his son to give up forgery and concentrate on his own work.   Despite his father's wishes, Harry takes the job and travels to [[Amsterdam]] to study Rembrandt. He decides to forge a never-discovered portrait of the master's blind father lost supposedly off the coast of Spain over 350 years ago. Harry continues his research in Paris, where he meets a beautiful Rembrandt scholar, Professor Marieke van den Broeck, who tells him she is a "student". Harry does not know that one of his main source books was written by Marieke. With her unwitting help, he gains access to an actual Rembrandt being restored at the [[Louvre]] from which he obtains scrapings of the original varnish. Soon Harry and Marieke become involved romantically.   Harry travels back to Amsterdam, where he paints his "Rembrandt" in an attic studio using period materials and a photograph of his own father as a model. He then journeys to Spain where he shows his three clients his forged masterpiece. After they find a local farmer who is paid to claim to have "found" the painting, the three clients invite two art experts to examine the painting, and they "confirm" it to be a Rembrandt. They return to London with the painting for a final authentication by a group of experts, which includes Marieke, to Harry's surprise. Several experts agree it is genuine, but Marieke does not. Dismayed to learn that his clients plan to hold a public auction, Harry tries to take back his painting but Davies pulls a modified [[Beretta 92|Beretta]] handgun on him. Harry manages to evade his line of fire and makes his escape with the painting while Davies shoots and kills Agachi and frames Harry for the murder and the theft of the painting.   After eluding arrest, Harry finds Marieke, handcuffs her to his wrist, and together they escape on the [[Orient Express]]. Forced to flee the train by the pursuing police, they make their way through the English countryside, eventually splitting up before Harry is finally arrested while attempting to destroy his forgery at [[Mentmore Towers]].     During his trial Harry tries to prove his innocence by duplicating the painting in open court to show that the painting is fake. His feelings, however, over his father's recent death and his wish for him to give up forgery prevent him from completing the painting. "Only Rembrandt can paint a Rembrandt," he concludes. Harry is saved when Hill, fearing his partner's homicidal intentions, testifies that Davies was actually the one who murdered Agachi, An enraged Davies is put in contempt and Harry is cleared of all charges.   After his release, Harry discovers that Hill plans to auction the painting himself and reap all the financial benefits. Having anticipated such an outcome, Harry had written a letter to the farmer in Spain notifying him of the deception. Spanish law allows the government first right of purchase from the discoverer of all treasures found on Spanish soil. The painting ends up in the [[Museo del Prado]] and the $55,000,000 that the painting was sold for end up in Spain. Of this money two thirds are taken by the Spanish government, half of the remaining sum is taken by the Church, and what is left is given to the farmer. In gratitude, the farmer invites Harry to Spain where he gives the artist half of the money—$5 million. Harry then travels back to Paris to meet Marieke. He gives her an original portrait that he painted of her in his own style. After signing the painting, the couple kiss and embrace on the romantic banks of the [[Seine]].

In the Flesh (1998 film)
  When police detective Philip Kirsch (Ed Corbin) and college business student Oliver Beck (Dane Ritter), [[closeted]] gay men, are brought together, they end up [[outing|outed]] at the same time. Detective Kirsch is working [[undercover]] to bust a drug ring that operates out of "The Blue Boy," a back street, [[gay bar]] and [[brothel]], at which Oliver works as the head [[Male prostitution|hustler]]—his calling card being his wearing red trousers.  Oliver succeeds in hustling Philip, who subsequently falls in love with him. Philip uses his resources as a policeman to find out more about Oliver and his past, which he discovers to be dark and tragic. Philip runs into Oliver at his [[day job]] in a [[music store]], and Oliver is grateful to him for his discretion in not letting on that he knows him. This friendliness quickly disappears when Oliver catches Philip following him. When he finds out that Philip is a police detective, that makes him even more undesirable to him. All this drastically changes when Oliver needs help later on.  Although Oliver has the redeeming quality of caring for dependent people like his sister Lisa (Adele Phares), who is suffering from drug addiction, and befriending a [[Mental retardation|mentally challenged]] adolescent, Mickey (Michael A. Newcomer), he cannot get over the guilt and self-loathing brought on by his causing the death of his close boyhood friend, Christopher Wingate (Erik Wingate), in a car crash brought on by his own drunken driving. He especially hates himself for avoiding drunk driving charges by moving his friend's dead body into the driver's seat of the wrecked car. He expresses his sorrow each night he begins work at The Blue Boy by going to the [[jukebox]], selecting the song "Breathe" (written by Wes Yoakam and performed by him and his band PopCycle, also known as Catfish Jenkins), and dancing to it with tears in his eyes. It is when he is doing this that Philip Kirsch sees him the first night of his stakeout.  It is Oliver's self-hatred and his fear of trusting anyone with his secrets that move him to control his sexual and emotional life by hustling. He is as successful at it as Philip is successful at being a police detective. Unfortunately, this causes them both to be surrounded by jealous rivals. Philip's associate detectives Grupe and Meyer are such rivals. Meyer is secretly involved in "The Blue Boy" drug ring from which Oliver gets heroin for his sister, and Oliver's knowledge of the drug ring, coupled with his growing connection to the investigating Kirsch, is a motive for Meyer to get rid of him by framing him with the murder of Mac, one of Oliver's best customers. Meyer poses as a mugger, who stabs Mac to death while he is getting money at an [[automated teller machine|ATM]]. Oliver is with Mac at the time: he is driving Mac's car because Mac is intoxicated. Oliver, then, becomes a witness to the murder, noticing the curious luminous watch on the muffled mugger's wrist. In fear he drives away in Mac's car, but he realizes that he is in serious trouble. When Philip finds Oliver to talk with him, he warns him to go to the police so that he could be a witness rather than a suspect.  Oliver is arrested for Mac's murder, but Meyer's plan is thwarted by Philip Kirsch, who provides an [[alibi]] for Oliver after he determines his innocence. Philip stands by Oliver when he is deserted by his friends and associates. Oliver is spurned by his girlfriend and boss Chloe (Alex Dawson), who is furious at him for being a gay hustler. He is barred and betrayed at the bar and is delivered to the police; and, even though he is released on the alibi Philip provided for him, he is evicted from his apartment with a week's notice by his landlady. Oliver has no one to turn to but Philip, who invites him to stay at his apartment. This support for Oliver is socially and economically costly for Philip: he is outted at work and suspended by his boss, police Lieutenant Krane (Roxzane T. Mims).  When Oliver moves in with Philip they only begin sleeping together when Oliver looks upon their intimacy as love freely given rather than as purchased sexual favors. Oliver is uncertain about what he is to do about his "night job" in view of his developing bond with Philip, but he must continue to make money to supply heroin to his sister.  The night that Oliver returns to his job at "The Blue Boy", Philip follows him to get him to quit hustling and exotic dancing and come home with him. Oliver sadly refuses, so Philip knocks him unconscious in the dressing room and takes him back to the apartment. Oliver is out of harm's way for Philip to go back to his police lieutenant with the information needed to bust "The Blue Boy" drug ring.  When Oliver awakens, he finds himself handcuffed to the weight bench. He succeeds in freeing himself, but he finds in a desk drawer a luminous watch identical with that worn by Mac's murderer. He angrily leaves the apartment supposing Philip guilty of Mac's murder, and he continues to suspect Philip until he finds that Detective Grupe, who stops and picks him up on the street, is wearing one of the suspicious watches as well. Thinking Grupe to be the murderer, Oliver escapes from his car and returns to Philip's apartment. The luminous watches provide the mystery plot with two red herrings, and moments later in the film it is revealed that the police lieutenant had given her whole department these watches.  At the apartment Philip is on the phone with his police lieutenant informing her of Oliver's disappearance when he is attacked from behind by Meyer, who knocks him unconscious and hangs up the phone. His plan is once again to frame Oliver with murder by killing Philip.  Oliver's return to the apartment stops Meyer from killing Philip, but Meyer succeeds in wounding both Philip and Oliver in the struggle that ensues. Meyer is about to kill them both when he is shot and killed from behind by Det. Grupe.  The last scene shows Oliver meeting Philip on the college campus some days later. Philip tests Oliver's reformation by asking him if he remembers his name. Oliver does and admits that he no longer considers Philip a [[john (prostitution)#Terminology|john]]. They walk away up the sidewalk together.

Suddenly seven have-nots have become land-owners. The existing power structure is deeply disturbed and the developments are commonly perceived as threatening the existing world order. Efforts are put into place to undo this wrong. The events triggered by the troubles originating both from within the group of inheritors and from the outside make up the story line of this movie. A sub plot is the mystery of the farmer's motivation for his unusual last will and testament. He was considered to be a hard man with a mean streak, and some of his land-owning peers don't rule out he did it to spite them, as a slap in their face after his death.

Jeans (film)

His twin sons, Vishwanathan and Ramamoorthy, are senior medical students who help him out in the evenings alongside the restaurant's chief cook, Juno. One evening, Vishwanathan goes to the airport to check on the family's supply concession and sees that some fellow Indians from Tamil Nadu – Madhumitha, her brother Madhesh, and their grandmother Krishnaveny – have difficulty with an address. He pitches in to help and learns that they just flew in from India so that Krishnaveny can undergo a crucial surgery to remove her [[Brain tumor|brain tumour]].  Later at the hospital, Vishwanathan (who is an intern at the same hospital) visits Krishnaveny's room after the operation, and notices she has been operated on the wrong side of her brain. Vishwanathan appeals aggressively to the doctors and has the error corrected by another surgery and then spearheads an angry fight for [[Damages|compensation]]. The hospital compensates $2 million to avoid a court case. Viswanathan's drastic measures win the respect and love of Madhumitha and her family.  When Krishnaveny realises that Vishwanathan and Madhumitha have fallen in love, she extends the family's stay in the United States and takes a liking to Vishwanathan's good nature. However, Nachiappan objects to the budding romance and wants his sons to marry identical twins because he himself has an identical twin brother, Pechiappan who has slow memory. They both had married for love in their youth, but are now estranged because Pechiappan's wife Sundaramba showed such tyrannical behaviour towards Nachiappan's pregnant wife Meiyaththa, that the latter died delivering the twin boys.  Krishnaveny tries to solve the problem by telling Nachiappan that Madhumitha also has an identical twin, Vaishnavi. The story fabricated by Krishnaveny is that Vaishnavi has been brought up in an orthodox Brahmin household. At this point they ring in Madhumitha's alter ego, contrasting Madhumitha with a very demure, typically traditional Indian version. Nachiappan falls for the act and visits India along with his sons to meet Vaishnavi, unaware that Vaishnavi and Madhumitha are the same person. Meanwhile, Pechiappan arrives to a warm welcome by his brother, but later attempts suicide. Nachiappan then rescues him and comes to hear of his sad story and comes up with a plan. Accordingly, Nachiappan and Pechiappan switch places. Nachiappan goes to his brother's wife and impersonates her husband to convince and reunite with her through his sons' (Visu and Ramu) marriage plan talks; he succeeds. Pechiappan impersonates his brother towards his nephews. Vishwanathan then meanwhile, discovers that Vaishnavi is Madhumitha and she was impersonating Vaishnavi. Enraged, he immediately leaves Madhumitha's household along with his family, but Ramamoorthy persuades his father to have Madhumitha and Vishwanathan married. Though not knowing, it was not his father he talked critically about his uncle who was right there impersonating. That made him guilty. He decided to have Vishwanathan married to Madhumitha. When Nachiappan realises that Madhumitha does not have a twin, he goes and stops the wedding. There they figure out that the brothers impersonated each other as well to get along. Nachiappan's brother Pechiappan's wife (Sundaramba) persuades Nachiappan to have them married because Madhumitha did the same thing the brothers did. Eventually, Visu and Madhu get married followed by a grand dinner reception specially given by Madhesh.

After losing Rory and the pursuers, Charlie realizes that the snowman is his father after Jack calls him 'Charlie boy' which is what his father used to call him and embraces him.  Jack reconnects with Charlie and teaches him the values that he never got to teach him when he was alive.

Upon reaching the mountains, Jack and Charlie arrive at the isolated cabin that the family was going to stay at a year earlier before Jack's death. Jack calls Gabby, nonchalantly asking her to come to the cabin to pick up Charlie; Gabby is shocked, but recognizes Jack's voice and obliges. Jack tells a disheartened Charlie that he has to leave. When his wife arrives, the snowman shell dissipates, revealing Jack as he appeared in life, but in an ethereal form. After telling Charlie that even though Jack will be in the afterworld, he will be with him wherever he is and wherever he goes and after saying farewell, Jack returns to the [[afterlife]].

Jinnah (film)
 The film opens with the words of Professor [[Stanley Wolpert]]:   The film begins with the events surrounding the [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah#Illness and death|death of Jinnah]]. On 11 September 1948, the ailing Jinnah's plane lands at [[Karachi Airport]] from [[Quetta]] where he was [[Quaid-e-Azam Residency|retreating at higher altitude]] in [[Ziarat]]. Jinnah's deteriorating health had led doctors to urge him to go to Karachi. On his way to [[Governor's House (Karachi)|Governor House]] Jinnah's ambulance breaks down with engine failure, where fate leaves the dying [[Quaid-e-Azam|Quaid of Pakistan]] in a state of confusion.  The film then cuts to a heavenly place where Jinnah is awaiting the final judgement on his deeds, where it is found that the celestial bureaucrats in charge have misplaced Jinnah's life-file and the whole heavenly computer network is down. With nothing but time on his hands, Jinnah has to answer the questions of his life asked by the heaven guide or Narrator ([[Shashi Kapoor]]) in order to decide where Jinnah should be sent, to Heaven or Hell.     The guide takes Jinnah to 1947 where, at the [[Simla Conference|Simla conference]] with [[Lord Mountbatten]], Jinnah [[Pakistan movement|demanded a homeland]] for British Indian Muslims. After [[World War II]], the British Imperial Government intends to withdraw and grant independence to the subcontinent. This would mean a Hindu-dominated state. Religious tensions between [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]] that were already increasing further erupt into violence throughout the subcontinent, leading to the idea of the [[Partition of India|partition]] and dissolution of [[British India]]. Jinnah's sister, [[Fatima Jinnah]], starts to campaign for Muslims and is arrested by an [[Indian Imperial Police]] officer for inciting Muslims. In a meeting with Mountbatten, [[Mohandas Gandhi]] proposes making Jinnah the first prime minister of the [[Union of India]] to avoid the formation of two states instead of one, but [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] opposes the idea. Jinnah refuses the offer and says, "Why do you want to force reluctant partners into a marriage?" He argues that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate.  Flashbacks resume when the Guide recounts the marital life of Jinnah, when he fell in love and married a [[Parsi]] named [[Rattanbai Petit]], later known as [[Maryam Jinnah]], against the will of her parents, mainly on grounds of religion. In 1922, Jinnah faces political isolation as he devoted every spare moment to be the voice of moderation in a nation torn by Hindu-Muslim antipathy. That created tension between Rattan and Jinnah. She finally leaves him with their daughter in September 1922, and they eventually separate in 1927. Ruttie died of cancer on 18 February 1929. The death of Ruttie had a huge impact on Jinnah's life. [[Allama Iqbal]] writes to Jinnah to run the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and fight for Pakistan. Initially, Jinnah refuses but accepts after the betrayal of the [[Indian National Congress]]. He went back to British India from the UK in order to start political journey of the [[two-nation theory]]. In 1940, the Muslim League annual conference is held from 22 to 24 March. Jinnah addresses thousands of Muslims and gives them the assurance of the birth of Pakistan.  Guide questions Jinnah as to who he loves the most apart from Ruttie and Fatima. He then remembers his daughter, who married a Parsi boy without his permission.  While he was addressing a Muslim League conference in 1947, rebel Indian Muslims who were not in the favour of Pakistan attack the conference and argue that if Pakistan is to be a Muslim state it cannot give equal rights to women and non-Muslims. However, the [[independence of Pakistan]] was carried out, and Guide and Jinnah saw the massacre of Muslims in migration done by Hindus and Sikhs. Jinnah is sworn in as the first [[Governor-General of Pakistan]] and announces [[Liaqat Ali Khan]] as the first [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]].  After independence and the end of [[British rule]], Pakistan stands as a new nation and sanctuary for the Muslims of the subcontinent. Jinnah is given the title of ''[[Quaid-e-Azam]]'' of Pakistan. Jinnah waits for the first train carrying Muslims who left India for Pakistan, but when the train arrives, they are all found dead save for one infant child. Fatimah and [[Edwina Mountbatten, Countess Mountbatten of Burma|Lady Edwina Mountbatten]] visit refugees and Iris learns the importance of independence. Mountbatten betrays Jinnah as the [[Hindu Maharaja]], [[Hari Singh|Sir Hari Singh]], stalls his decision on which nation to join. With the population in revolt in October 1947, aided by Pakistani irregulars, the Maharaja accedes to India; Indian troops are airlifted in. Jinnah objects to that and orders that Pakistani troops move into [[Kashmir]], which leads to a [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|war between India and Pakistan]] then and afterward from time to time in the [[Kashmir conflict]].  The film jumps into a final fictional scene of Lord [[Louis Mountbatten|Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] (last Viceroy of [[British India]]) in a Heavenly Court. Jinnah is fighting a case against him over his betrayal. The film ends with Jinnah and his angel judge traveling back in time to the scene of Muslim refugees. Jinnah expresses his sorrow over the plight of the refugees and result during the division of [[Punjab]]. They chant "Pakistan Zindabad" and "Quid-e-Azam Zindabad" in response, which ends the film.

He tries his best to win her back but fails.  Sooraj's grandfather steps in to ease the situation and asks her to marry him. Komal agrees, on the condition that he would have to give up his playboy lifestyle and become responsible: He would have to quit smoking, drinking and women for her to marry him. Sooraj, not quite the man he was, gives up every bad habit he has.  One day Sooraj returns home and he finds a boy, Kabir ([[Aditya Narayan]]), claiming to be his son.  Tests prove that Kabir is indeed his son, but Sooraj doesn't even remember the mother ([[Namrata Shirodkar]]). Kabir shows him a photograph which helps Sooraj identify the woman he had a fling lasting a few months. He brings the boy back, identifying him as his friend's child. Sooraj starts to like him and gradually, realizing his mistake, he recognises him as his son. But Kabir does not like Komal and is unhappy to learn that Sooraj never loved his mother.  Later Sooraj has to choose between Komal and Kabir. Sooraj is about to marry Komal, but he knows that he cannot hide the truth from Komal. He falls into a dilemma.

Komal hails Sooraj's honesty and agrees to accept Kabir as her son and to marry Sooraj.  
Jerry and Tom
 Hit men Tom and Jerry wait in a Chicago bar for the go-ahead to kill Stanley.  Anxious to get the hit done, Jerry suggests they perform the hit immediately; Tom refuses, and Stanley entertains them with jokes.  As the phone rings, the film shifts to a flashback set ten years earlier, in 1984.  Jerry, a youth employed at Billy's used car dealership, joins Tom as he walks with Karl.  Karl describes how a local gangster bit off the nose of Karl's nephew.  Disturbed by the audaciousness and brutality of the attack, Tom promises to look into the issue.  However, Karl becomes spooked when they enter Tom's car, and Karl begins bargaining with Tom, to Jerry's confusion.  Tom agrees that the two are friends with a long history but strangles Karl after an apology.  Jerry throws up but insists that he is otherwise fine.  Tom's next hit involves a trip out of state.  Jerry tags along, and when he becomes surly, Tom allows him to accompany him to the site of the hit itself, a cinema.  There, they meet an unnamed man who becomes annoyed with their loud conversation in which Jerry describes a domestic dispute with his girlfriend, Deb.  The man in the cinema tells them the story about how he and his fiancée, Vicki, the star of the low budget action film he is watching, angered the mob.  After hit men assassinate Vicki via a weapons mishap on the set, he goes into hiding and loses his will to live.  Moved by the story, Jerry decides to marry his girlfriend, and the two hit men rise to leave.  Jerry is surprised when Tom slits the throat of the man, and Tom admonishes him to not get so emotionally involved in the stories of their victims.  On Jerry's first kill, the two track their victim to a Chinese restaurant.  Nervous, Jerry becomes paranoid and makes a spectacle of himself in front of the victim.  To calm him, Tom describes [[Ronald Reagan]]'s final acting performance, a cold-blooded hit man in ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]''.  Enthused by the thought of following in Reagan's footsteps, Jerry is able to relax and make his first kill.  Later, as the two wait for their next hit, Tom tells Jerry about their co-worker, Vic, who is rumored to have had an affair with [[Marilyn Monroe]] and assassinated [[John F. Kennedy]].  When the target arrives, Jerry asks to make the hit himself, and Tom impatiently watches as Jerry awkwardly attempts to make a clean kill.  After Jerry simply pulls out the pistol and shoots the man head-on, they leave.  Tom and Jerry join Vic for a meal, which Vic has prepared himself.  During the conversation, Vic reveals that he intends to publish his memoirs.  After Vic describes a feature film adaptation and talk show appearances that he has planned, the trio argue over the appropriateness of such actions and who should play each of them in a film.  Tom suggests [[Don Knotts]] for Jerry, who becomes offended that the others do not take him seriously.  Jerry pulls out a syringe and explains that he is diabetic, only to suddenly stab Vic with it.  Surprised and angered, Tom castigates Jerry for killing Vic in such an undignified manner, as they had previously planned to take Vic out back and shoot him after he finished with his dinner, a death that Tom considered more proper for an assassin of Vic's stature.   In their final hit, Jerry panics and accidentally murders an innocent bystander.  He then tells a disturbed Tom of how he occasionally fantasizes about killing his family, eventually admitting that he has pointed a loaded weapon at his infant son's head.  In the present, the phone rings, and Tom reluctantly answers it; he is given the go-ahead and kills Jerry.  After Tom unties Stanley, Stanley reveals that he has been tasked with killing Tom.  The film ends as Stanley asks Tom if he knows any good jokes.

On the morning of his execution, his kin receives a small alcohol stove (not a gas lamp as commonly portrayed) from his cell containing the last poem "Mi Ultimo Adios". Stopping at the place of execution facing the rising sun, Rizal requested the authorities for him to face the firing squad, but the request was denied. Calm and without haste, he requested to have his head spared instead and the captain agrees. At the moment the shooting squad points at his back, he readily uttered his final words: ''Consummatum est'' ("It is done").

His mother Prema wants to search for him, but is told it is too dangerous. Suresh is rescued from Sabre the [[Leopard]] by the [[Indian elephant|elephant]] Bono and the [[monkey]] Mantoo, and he is given the ability to communicate with the animals. Bono informs the animals present that Sabre has hunted on the Night of Deva and for Sabre to be brought to him. When Sabre appears and Bono scolds him for violating the no hunting rule that occurs on the Night of Deva, Sabre states that he will come for the boy when he is old enough to defend himself. Suresh is named "Manling" and raised by the forest creatures where Bono ends up training the Manling to defend himself when it comes to the day when he has to fight Sabre.  As an adult, Manling (now called Krishna) must battle Sabre. At the same time, Professor John Gellar has picked up his niece Anna from the airport at the time when he was looking for a valuable statue associated with the [[Nāga]] (with the statue enabling anyone pure of heart to understand all the world's languages) and the scroll that goes with it. Rajah Singh is also seeking to obtain the statue where he claims that the treasure belongs to his family and hires treasure hunter Joshua Hook to find it.

Professor Gellar also tells Anna that the mother of the boy died of a broken heart.  Krishna arrives at the Valley of Death where he must fight Sabre. But when he defeats Sabre in a manner that violates the rules involving defeating him near a village by using fire against him, he is told by Bono to go out on his own much to the objection of Mantoo. Under advice from Deva the next day, Krishna is told that he must return to the humans. Geller and his pretty niece Anna find him and take him in, teaching him English and how to be human. He learns fast because he knew human ways at one time. Professor Geller also mentioned in the narration that Sabre left the jungle and wasn't heard from again.  Anna and Krishna become romantically involved. After Mantoo visits Krishna, Bono is shown to have some regrets of sending Krishna away. Geller's servant Ravi tells Joshua Hook and his cousin Sanjay about Gellar also looking for the statue. The next day, Geller finds his map missing as Joshua Hook and his men arrives with the map as Joshua Hook captures Anna and hands her over to Rajah Singh. Geller is now forced to work with Joshua Hook to obtain the statue from the sacred jungle. Disappointed that Mr. Hook had tricked him, Ravi tells Krishna what happened and Krishna starts to rescue Anna from Rajah Singh's palace  After Krishna frees Anna from Rajah Singh, they go after Joshua Hook as Deva tells Krishna that he must enlist Bono's help and tell him that it's his orders to help Krisha. Krishna finds Bono and Mantoo where Krishna tells Bono what Deva wanted Krishna to tell Bono. Arriving near the spot where the statue is located, Krishna, Anna, Bono, and Mantoo await nearby as Deva tries to prevent Joshua Hook from obtaining the statue. This doesn't work as Deva teleports away when Joshua Hook tries to shoot him which ends up breaking open the rock the contains the statue. After wounding Professor Gellar as Anna runs to his side, Joshua Hook orders Sanjay to reach into the rock and grab the statue and scroll. Sanjay does so and Joshua Hook makes off with the statue, the scroll, and Anna. Deva tells Krishna to go after Mr. Hook while he heals Professor Gellar.  Moments later at Rajah Singh's palace, Joshua Hook and Rajah Singh make their way to the Alter Room with Anna as their prisoner. Krishna and Mantoo enter the palace and make their way to the Alter Room. After Sanjay leaves upon tying Anna to a column, Joshua Hook has Rajah Singh recite the prayer that would summon Nāga to them. When the giant [[cobra]] Nāga arrives upon Krisha and Mantoo's arrival, it deems Joshua Hook unworthy to receive the special gift. Joshua Hook fires his gun at Nāga which doesn't faze Nāga who then devours Joshua Hook. When Rajah Singh states to Nāga that he is Nāga's disciple, Nāga tells Rajah Singh that he doesn't deserve the title and turns him into a [[pig]]. Upon Nāga turning his attention towards Krishna and Anna, Krishna tells Nāga not to harm Anna. Nāga agrees with Krishna's demands declaring them worthy of the special gift. Before regressing back into statue form, Nāga tells Krishna to hide his statue and scroll someplace where nobody will ever find it. After Naga leaves, Krishna frees Anna who can now understand Mantoo.  With Professor Gellar recovered and Ravi is the servant of Professor Gellar again, Krishna prepares to leave as he considers Anna part of his family and tells her to come visit him someday. Krishna leaves and reunites with Bono and Mantoo. A voice-over by Professor Gellar states that Krishna has returned to the jungle and placed Nāga's statue and scroll someplace where nobody will ever find it.

Katasumi and 4444444444
 ''Katasumi'' begins with two Japanese schoolgirls (revealed to be Kanna and Hisayo in the first ''Ju-on'' film) who are caring for their school's [[rabbit]]s. They are sweeping out the cages and feeding the animals when Kanna cuts her hand, and Hisayo leaves her to go into the school and fetch a bandage.  When she returns, Kanna is nowhere to be found. The rabbit cages are empty, and bits of blood and fur are strewn about.  Hisayo then sees something that looks like a crawling woman (Kayako) begin to move towards her from the far side of the backyard. As she backs into a corner, she finds the body of Kanna amongst the debris from the damaged rabbit cages. She holds a trowel up defensively in front of herself while Kayako closes in upon her. Kanna then moves her bloody head, and looks on as the frightened Hisayo cowers in the corner and waits. The screen fades to black and Hisayo's fate is left unknown.  ''4444444444'' opens with a young man (revealed to be named Tsuyoshi in the first ''Ju-on'' film) riding his bicycle home. As he rounds a corner in front of an apparently abandoned building, he begins to hear a cell phone ringing, though he cannot see it. He hunts through a garbage pile next to the darkened entrance to the building, finding the phone after several rings. Upon closer examination, the phone is displaying an incoming call from the number 4444444444 (the numeral "4" is symbolic of bad luck in many Asian cultures, a phenomenon that is known as [[tetraphobia]].). Tsuyoshi answers the phone to hear rasping, cat-like sounds issue from the earpiece. After unsuccessfully attempting to communicate with the unknown caller, he hangs up.  Seconds later, the phone rings again, and again he answers. Tsuyoshi is getting frustrated at this point, and begins to look a little worried, as though someone might be playing a joke on him. As he sits on the steps in front of the deserted building, he continues to try to identify the caller. Looking around nervously, he asks, "Are you... Watching me?"  Suddenly, a voice replies, "I am," though it does not come from the phone. Tsuyoshi turns slowly to see a pale boy (Toshio) beside him, drumming white fingers on his knees. Tsuyoshi looks startled, and the camera lingers on Toshio for a moment before zooming in quickly while he opens his mouth in a cat-like scream as a black tar-like substance drips from it.

During her pregnancy, Tina, who also loved the baby more than her own life, writes eight letters to her daughter (one for each of her first eight birthdays) and gives them to Rahul's mother ([[Farida Jalal]]). Before dying, Tina asks Rahul to promise her to name their daughter Anjali.  Eight years go by and Rahul is a single parent living with his daughter Anjali Khanna ([[Sana Saeed]]) and his mother. His mother worries that Rahul is lonely and that Anjali is missing out on a motherly figure in her life, but Rahul brushes it off saying that having him and his mother is enough.

As time goes by, Anjali realises that she is in love with Rahul, and is encouraged by her motherly guardian Rifat Bi (Himani Shivpuri) to tell him.  Before she is able to declare her feelings for him, Rahul instead tells Anjali that he is in love with Tina. Devastated, Anjali decides to leave college and shares a tearful goodbye with Rahul.

The search fails, despite the family's best efforts. After Jennifer's death back in the U.S., James falls into academic stagnation, having spent all his foundation grant money raising the children as a single parent. Scheduled to lecture at a college and fearful of being charged with misuse of grant funds, James concocts an imaginary tribe, the Shelmikedmu, using the names of his children as a basis. He later fakes a 16&nbsp;mm "documentary" film, casting his children as tribe members and superimposing footage of a legitimate New Guinean tribe so as to enhance the illusion.  Anthropologist Veronica Micelli ([[Jenna Elfman]]) contacts cable-TV producer Henry Spivey ([[David Ogden Stiers]]), forcing James to continue creating fraudulent footage as James' rival Ruth Allen ([[Lily Tomlin]]) becomes suspicious. Because he has described a culture unlike any other, Krippendorf's fraud becomes increasingly famous. James himself masquerades as a tribal elder, while his two sons, Mickey ([[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]]) and Edmund (Carl Michael Lindner), create and enact increasingly imaginative rituals. Only the eldest child, James' daughter Shelly, refuses to participate due to her disgust at the dishonesty perpetrated by her father.  Taking advantage of her curiosity, James tricks Veronica into participating in his false documentary. When she discovers the truth, she is initially angry, but later helps James continue his fraud. Ruth Allen travels to New Guinea, discovering no tribe in the location specified by James. She transmits the news via fax to a colleague, who exposes James at a gala. James' imaginative son, Mickey, improvises a lie, that the Shelmikedmu hide by means of a magical ritual known only to them.  Unknown to the majority of the characters, Shelly has contacted the New Guineans befriended by her family during the futile search for the lost tribe, urging them to masquerade as the Shelmikedmu in order to disappoint Ruth Allen. The ruse succeeds, and the accusation of fraud is abandoned. James, relieved of his worries, ends his fraud. Because Veronica has become sexually involved with him during her participation in his deceit, she assumes the role of a mother toward the children, though she is not explicitly said to marry James.

As they climb up to rescue them, Dinah and Dana fall off the top and land on Cera, and a bolt of lightning strikes the life-sized stone tooth she is standing on, igniting a fire that immediately engulfs Saurus Rock and spreads rapidly throughout the Great Valley. The children try to put out the fire before it spreads, but the accident leads to Littlefoot and Cera arguing and fighting which leads to a schism that divides Littlefoot from the others when he says that they should go their own way. As they walk home, an ''[[Allosaurus]]'' chases them. The children cross a gorge via a suspended log, but when the Sharptooth tries to follows them, the log breaks under its weight and it falls to its apparent death. When they get home, they are confronted by Cera's father, who scolds Cera for her disobedience and not properly caring for the twins. He tells her that he is very angry and disappointed and tells her to immediately march herself right home. He continues with his talk on her that she still must be watched herself. That night, Littlefoot has a nightmare in which he is sent to Hell for eternity.  Over the next few days, incidents of bad luck plague the Valley. After a [[tornado]] hits the Valley, the adults blame Doc, as the misfortunes apparently occurred after his arrival, while Littlefoot blames himself and his friends, recalling the breaking of Saurus Rock. Eager to exonerate Doc, Littlefoot attempts to take one of the Sharptooth's teeth to replace the broken stone. In the process, he discovers the Sharptooth is still alive. After temporarily escaping it, Littlefoot is attacked by a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', with Grandpa intervening, having been led there by Littlefoot's friends. Soon the ''Allosaurus'' returns and works together with the ''Tyrannosaurus'' to take down Grandpa Longneck. However, Doc comes to the rescue. The sharpteeth charge through and run into the rock spire and fall down. Doc and Grandpa work together (now that the sharpteeth are down) to pull down a category of rocks and crush the carnivores to death. When the carnivores are now defeated (after the two longnecks have encased them into a pile of rocks), one of the teeth from the Allosaurus falls out and lands on the ground. Then the children use the broken out tooth (from the Allosaurus) to repair Saurus Rock.  Doc departs, remarking that Littlefoot already has a hero on whom to depend on, referring to Grandpa. Littlefoot asks Grandpa if the bad luck will finally be over. They both agree that while there is no such thing as bad luck, there is also no harm in making sure. Littlefoot and Cera later build a legend of their own based on this new [[paradigm]], portraying Grandpa Longneck as a hero and savior called "The Great Dinosaur".  
The Lake (1998 film)
 Jackie Ivers (Bleeth) is a [[Los Angeles]] nurse who returns home to the small town of San Vicente to find that her friends and family have taken on bizarrely different personalities. Jackie notices that everyone who goes into the town's lake come out different.  As the movie progresses, Jackie first-handedly witnesses what is happening to everyone around her as she is kidnapped by people from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]]. The other world is a duplicate of [[Earth]] but is now polluted and its [[ozone layer]] gone. In order to survive, the duplicates intend to take over Earth. The entrances to the duplicate Earth are called the vortex, which are located in major bodies of water, ponds, and lakes.

Last Night (1998 film)
 In Toronto, a group of friends and family prepare for the end of the world, expected at midnight as the result of a calamity that is not explained, but which has been expected for several months. There has been panic and rioting after the imminent catastrophe was announced, but the chaos has since largely died down, with only sporadic murders and robberies. On the last evening, depressed widower Patrick meets with his family, including his sister Jennifer, for a mock Christmas dinner and celebration, though he leaves prematurely to spend his final hours alone in his apartment. He unexpectedly meets Sandra, who is stranded in the city and attempting to reunite with her new husband Duncan, who works at a power company. Duncan spends much of the day calling his customers to reassure them that their heating gas will be kept on until the very end. Sandra and Duncan have a [[suicide pact]]. Although intending to die alone, Patrick invites Sandra up to his apartment and attempts to help her find her husband.  Meanwhile, Patrick's best friend Craig embarks on a nearly non-stop sex marathon as he attempts to fulfill every fantasy he has ever had, pursuing [[interracial sex]], sex with his old French teacher Mme. Carlton, and sex with a virgin, among others. With Sandra in need of a car and Craig having a car collection, Patrick and Sandra visit him and ask for one of his vehicles. Craig at first refuses, wanting to die with a complete collection, but Patrick persuades him to give one up. Craig also attempts to have a homosexual affair with Patrick, one of his fantasies, but Patrick indicates he is not interested in having sex with anyone on his last night.  Duncan is randomly murdered by a rioter, and Craig's car Sandra has borrowed is vandalized. Upon realizing she will not reunite with Duncan, Sandra asks Patrick to join her suicide pact. As midnight approaches, they both sit on the roof facing each other, listening to the song "[[Guantanamera]]", each holding a loaded pistol to the other's temple. However, as the final seconds approach, both characters are overcome with emotion and simultaneously let their pistols slip away as they slowly embrace in a kiss. The world finally ends.  
The Last Broadcast (film)
 The film deals with a [[documentary film]]-maker named David Leigh, and his investigation of the ''Fact or Fiction'' murders, where a pair of [[public-access television]] [[cable TV]] hosts were murdered in mysterious circumstances. Leigh sets out to find the truth behind these killings while making his documentary.  ''Fact or Fiction'' is a show dealing with unsolved mysteries and the [[paranormal]]. Its two hosts are Steven "Johnny" Avkast and Locus Wheeler. Initially a success, we find out through Leigh's investigations that the show is failing and is threatened with imminent cancellation. It is at this point that Avkast comes up with the idea of a live [[Internet Relay Chat]] section of the show.  It is during one such chat that a caller gives Avkast the idea of searching for the [[Jersey Devil]] in the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|Pine Barrens]] (the film only mentions the Jersey Devil, however, and gives absolutely no background details of the legend). Leaping on this idea, Avkast and Wheeler recruit Rein Clackin, a sound-man who allegedly can record the paranormal, and Jim Suerd, a [[psychic]]; Leigh later claims that Suerd is emotionally disturbed. The plan is for the four of them to enter the Pine Barrens, where Suerd will lead them to the location of the Jersey Devil. During the hunt, they will broadcast a live show simultaneously via television, Internet, and [[amateur radio]].  They enter the Barrens, but only Suerd emerges alive; the others are horribly murdered. Avkast's body is never found, though it is made clear during Suerd's murder trial that he could not have survived considering the amount of blood lost at the crime scene. Leigh then summarizes the trial. Suerd, the only survivor, is also the only suspect. To aid the prosecution case they employ a video engineer (nicknamed "The Killer Cutter") to compile a portrait of the group's trip using the surviving film footage found at the crime scene. Suerd is found guilty and imprisoned, though there is doubt over his guilt as his clothes were not drenched in blood and there is evidence he was engaged in an [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC room]] at the times of the murders.  Before anything can be proven, Suerd dies in prison of unknown causes, and the case is considered closed by the authorities. However, Leigh has a box sent to him containing a damaged videotape reel, which Leigh assumes is tape from the ''Fact or Fiction'' team thought not to exist. A data retrieval expert named Shelly Monarch is called in to reconstruct the images on the tape. She finds that not only have Wheeler and Clacklin's deaths been caught on tape, but that Suerd could not have committed the murders. What is also caught is a blurred image of the real killer. As Leigh videotapes her, Monarch uses an image editor to re-construct the image of the killer's face. She completes the reconstructing of the image before Leigh's next visit, but she is shocked to discover that the killer is Leigh himself.  The camera then 'shifts' to a third person perspective, whereas all previous footage had been shot by Leigh. From this perspective we observe Leigh attack Monarch and suffocating her to death with a piece of plastic sheeting. He loads Monarch's corpse into his car and drives it out to the woods, where he dumps it in a clearing and then begins awkwardly videotaping himself narrating the next segment of his documentary.  
The Last Days of Disco
 In the "very early 1980s," Alice Kinnon and Charlotte Pingress, two recent college graduates, work in a New York City publishing house as poorly paid readers. After work one night, they are able to enter an exclusive disco nightclub, where Alice is hoping to socialize with Jimmy Steinway, who works in advertising and uses the nightclub to entertain clients. Jimmy is ill-tempered because he has been barred from bringing clients to the nightclub and is eventually kicked out by his friend Des McGrath, who works as a manager at the club but whose job is in jeopardy for allowing Jimmy and his clients inside. After Jimmy leaves, Alice takes Charlotte's advice to go home with her second choice, Tom Platt. At work the following morning, Charlotte and Alice talk with other editors about how to fast-track their careers. They also decide to move in together with a third girl, Holly, as they cannot afford to pay rent on their own. Despite Alice's reluctance, the women eventually settle on a [[railroad apartment]].  Returning to the club, Alice is upset to learn that Charlotte has designs on Jimmy. She is further upset when Tom tells her that when he slept with her, he had a long-term girlfriend he was separated from and his one-night stand with Alice convinced him to return to her. Des then begins to pursue Alice.   At work, Alice decides to pursue the publication of a book on [[Buddhism]], written by the [[Dalai Lama]]'s brother, that Charlotte had previously recommended rejecting, and Alice gains the editors' respect. It is discovered that the author is not in fact the Dalai Lama's brother, but Alice maintains the book is one of the best she's ever read. Meanwhile, Charlotte, now dating Jimmy, is openly insecure about Jimmy and Alice's apparent friendliness.  At the club, in front of a group of various friends, Charlotte loudly announces that Alice has [[gonorrhea]], after figuring it out when Alice refuses to drink. Charlotte later apologizes to Alice but tells her not to be embarrassed, as it will make men think of her as more accessible. In fact, after learning this, Des does become more interested in being with Alice, and they start dating casually.   Alice has dinner with Tom to confront him about giving her gonorrhea. He initially denies it, arguing she could have contracted it from someone else, but Alice tells him he was her first sexual partner. He then admits he also gave her [[herpes]].   Meanwhile, Josh Neff, a [[District attorney|D.A.]] and friend of Jimmy's who also frequently attends the club, asks Alice to lunch to pitch a book to her. At lunch, he confesses he is interested not in writing a book but in Alice. Alice and Josh go on a real date, and he tells her he is on medication for [[manic depression]]. Upon returning home from the date, Alice discovers Charlotte being taken away in an ambulance after a miscarriage and being told by Jimmy that he is moving to [[Barcelona]]. At the hospital, Charlotte asks Alice if Jimmy ever expressed interest in being with her; when Alice admits that he did, Charlotte reacts with tears and tells her she will be moving out.  The nightclub is raided by the police for tax fraud, and Des tries to run away despite Josh's promise to protect him, believing that Josh's interest in Alice will cause him to act unfairly. They later discover that even before the club was raided by the police, disco records were no longer selling and attendance was down.   Alice and Charlotte learn that their employer has merged with a larger publishing house and that layoffs are to be expected. Some time later, Charlotte, Josh, and Des are seen leaving the unemployment office. Josh tells the group that he is going to [[Lutèce (restaurant)|Lutèce]] for lunch, treated by Alice, who is celebrating her promotion (her book was published after she switched it from [[non-fiction|nonfiction]] to [[self-help]]). Des and Charlotte talk about how their big personalities are too much for normal personalities like Alice, Josh, and Jimmy. Des also says that pairing off monogamously detracts from their glamorous lifestyle, and Charlotte agrees.   On the subway on their way to Lutèce, Alice and Josh discuss their future prospects. As the end credits begin, they break character to dance to "[[Love Train]]", and are eventually joined by the entire subway station of passengers when they arrive at their destination.  
The Last Contract
 The film suggests that a British professional hit-man was hired by the CIA to assassinate the Swedish Prime Minister [[Olof Palme]], because of Palme's stance on nuclear weapons in Scandinavia . The hit-man ([[Michael Kitchen]]) works for money alone and is very careful. He finds a Norwegian man that hates the Swedish P.M. He also involves a man to be blamed (this character is ''Christer Pettersson'', originally convicted of the ''real assassination'', but freed on appeal). The Norwegian man kills Palme just as his wife notices Christer Pettersson. Soon afterwards the hitman kills the killer, and all traces pointing to the professional hitman are gone.  
Left Luggage (film)
 While escaping from Nazis during World War II, a Jewish man buries two suitcases full of things dear to his heart in the ground. The war deprived him of his family, and afterwards he endlessly turns over the soil of Antwerp to find the suitcases, an obsessive compulsion. He keeps checking old maps and keeps digging, trying to find what he lost. His daughter Chaya is a beautiful modern girl looking for a part-time job. She finds a place as a nanny in the strictly observant [[Hasidic]] family with many children, although her secular manners clearly fly in the face of their beliefs. One of the reasons she is accepted is that mother of the family is absolutely overburdened by the household, so Chaya stays despite the resistance of the father, who is normally an indisputable authority in the family.  She develops a special bond with the youngest of the boys, four-year-old [[Simcha]], who seems incapable of speaking. She encourages him to speak while walking in the park, and it appears that, after some coaching from Chaya (who needs coaching herself) during the upcoming [[Passover Seder]], Simcha will be able to chant the section of the Haggadah usually reserved for the youngest speaking participant - the Four Questions.  At first, Simcha's nerves prevent him from chanting, and his brothers begin to chant instead. Simcha finally lifts his voice. The entire family, including Chaya, applauds his efforts, but his judgmental father does not recognize this great step, but instead criticizes the boy for a mistake. Chaya confronts the father, and in the process, discovers his own pain as a Holocaust survivor, and begins to understand her own parents' grief.  The anti-Semitic superintendent of the building is a constant problem for the entire family and now for Chaya. However, as opposed to the observant Jews, she refuses to be a victim and does not put up with his anti-Semitic tricks. She fights him, thus exciting the children's admiration and father's wrath.  Unfortunately, walks with Simcha end in a tragedy: after sneaking to the park, he drowns in the pond, while chasing the ducks he loved so much. Some in the community hold Chaya responsible for his death. However, in a scene where Chaya goes to the family's mourning service, the mother feels compassion for Chaya and realizes that Chaya felt a deep connection with Simcha. As an act of acceptance, his mother rips Chaya's shirt, which is a sign of a mourner (a sibling, parent, child or spouse of the deceased) in Jewish tradition.  The boy's father finally, albeit silently, acknowledges Chaya's connection with Simcha when she observes the graveside service.  Chaya's experience allows her to finally accept her parents' past, and to embrace her own Jewishness.  The film is a commentary not only on external (gentile) anti-Semitism, but also on the lack of connection and self-acceptance of assimilated Jews.  
Lethal Weapon 4
 Lorna Cole ([[Rene Russo]]) is pregnant with [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Sergeant Martin Riggs' baby; they are not married, but both are thinking about it. LAPD Sergeant Roger Murtaugh's daughter Rianne (Tracie Wolfe), is also pregnant, though he is not told the child is with Detective Lee Butters (Chris Rock) since he did not want his daughter to marry a police officer. Due to issues with the department's insurance carrier over Riggs and Murtaugh's actions as sergeants, Captain Murphy (Steve Kahan) promotes them to captains.  The officers along with Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) come upon a [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] immigrant smuggling ring after running an ocean-going vessel aground. The captain of the boat escapes. In the subsequent investigation, Murtaugh finds Hong (Eddy Ko) and his family hiding from US Immigration officers to avoid deportation. Murtaugh offers them shelter in his home, and their families, along with Riggs and Cole, quickly bond. Hong reveals he is looking for his uncle, a skilled engraver, who had paid for their passage to the United States.  Continued investigation of the smuggling ring leads the officers to "Uncle" Benny Chan, a crime boss operating from a [[Chinatown]] restaurant. There, they are introduced to high-ranking [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]] negotiator Wah Sing Ku (Jet Li). Chan forces them out of his restaurant when the officers show no probable cause. Outside, Riggs spots the escaped captain and tries to give chase but fails to capture him. However, Ku later intercepts the captain and kills him as punishment for attracting the police's attention. Chan and Ku take steps to eliminate all those in on their plans.  Hong is able to contact his uncle, but this leads the Triads to Murtaugh's house. Ku and the Triad thugs kidnap the Hongs, tie up Murtaugh, his family, Riggs and Cole and set the house ablaze. Ping, Hong's grandson, has evaded capture and helps to free the others in time. Though Riggs and Murtaugh chase down and kill some of the Triad, Ku escapes. Ku brings Hong to his uncle at a warehouse, where he has been engraving plates for a counterfeiting operation for Ku and Chan in exchange for transit for his family. Ku kills Hong in front of his uncle to assure his continued work.  The officers attempt to shake Chan for more information, but are unable to get any leads until they discuss what they know with Detective Ng (Calvin Jung), who has worked on cases involving the Chinese government before. Ng recognizes that Ku must be trying to negotiate with a corrupt Chinese general for the release of the Four Fathers, high-ranking Triad members that include Ku's brother (Conan Lee). New information leads them to the abandoned warehouse where they find the bodies of Hong, his uncle, and Chan, the latter two killed by Ku after they served their usefulness. Knowing that Ku plans to use counterfeit money, the police intercept the exchange between Ku and the general, telling the general the money is fake. A firefight breaks out between the Triad, the general's private army and the police, and most of the Triad and army are killed. Ku attempts to escape with his brother, but his brother is shot and killed by Murtaugh. Riggs and Murtaugh pursue Ku to a pier where they engage him in a brutal fistfight. Murtaugh impales Ku through the stomach before the pier collapses and sends Riggs and Ku into the water. Riggs is able to find a [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] assault rifle and finish Ku, while Murtaugh arrives in time to help rescue Riggs from a piece of concrete that had pinned him underwater.  Later, Riggs visits his dead wife's grave and asks her for advice about his impending marriage with Lorna, about which he still has doubts; Getz arrives and offers a childhood story that gives Riggs a new light on the situation. They learn Lorna is about to give birth and race to the hospital, where Riggs and Lorna are ceremonially married by a [[rabbi]] just before she enters labor. Their son and Rianne's daughter are born, and Murtaugh accepts Butters as his son-in-law. Murphy gives Riggs and Murtaugh their rank of Sergeant back since the city is insured again and Hong's family is granted [[right of asylum|asylum]].  
The Legend of 1900
 The story is told ''[[in medias res]]'' as a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s. Max Tooney, a musician, enters a secondhand music shop just before closing time, broke and badly in need of money. He has only a [[C.G. Conn|Conn]] trumpet, which he sells for less than he had hoped. Clearly torn at parting from his prized possession, he asks to play it one last time. The shopkeeper agrees, and as the musician plays, the shopkeeper immediately recognizes the song from a broken [[Matrix (record production)|record matrix]] he found inside a recently acquired secondhand piano. He asks who the piece is by, and Max tells him the story of 1900.  1900 was found abandoned on the [[Four funnel liner|four stacker oceanliner]] SS ''Virginian'', a baby in a box, and likely the son of poor immigrants from steerage. Danny, a coal-man from the boiler room, is determined to raise the boy as his own. He names the boy Danny Boodman T. D. Lemon 1900 (a combination of his own name, an advertisement found on the box and the year he was born) and hides him from the ship's officers. Sadly, a few years later, Danny is killed in a workplace accident, and 1900 is forced to survive aboard the ''Virginian'' as an orphan. For many years, he travels back and forth across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], keeping a low profile.  The boy shows a particular gift for music and eventually grows up and joins the ship's orchestra. He befriends Max in 1927, but never leaves the vessel.  Apparently, the outside world is too "big" for his imagination at this point. But he stays current with outside musical trends as passengers explain to him a new music trend or style, and he immediately picks it up and starts playing it for them.  His reputation as a pianist is so renowned that [[Jelly Roll Morton]], of [[New Orleans]] jazz fame, on hearing of 1900's skill comes aboard to challenge him to a piano duel. After hearing Jelly Roll Morton's first tune 1900 plays a piece so simple and well known ("Silent Night") that the self-proclaimed inventor of jazz feels mocked. As Morton becomes more determined to display his talent, he plays an impressive tune ("The Crave") that brings tears to 1900's eyes. 1900 calmly sits down at the piano and plays from memory the entire tune that Morton had just played. 1900's playing fails to impress the crowd until he plays an original piece ("Enduring Movement") of such virtuosity and superhuman speed that the metal piano strings become hot enough for 1900 to light a cigarette. He hands it to Morton, who has lost the duel.  A record producer, having heard of 1900's prowess, brings a primitive recording apparatus aboard and cuts a demo record of a 1900 original composition. The recorded music is created by 1900 as he gazes at a woman (The Girl) who has just boarded and whom he finds attractive. When 1900 hears the recording, he takes the master, offended at the prospect of anyone hearing the music without his having performed it live.  He then tries to give the master to The Girl who inspired it, but is unable to and breaks the matrix into pieces.  The story flashes back to the mid-1940s periodically, as we see Max (who leaves the ship's orchestra in 1933) trying to lure 1900 out of the now-deserted hull of the ship. Having served as a hospital ship and transport in [[World War II]], she is scheduled to be scuttled and sunk far offshore. Max manages to get aboard the ship with the recording 1900 made long ago and plays it, hoping to attract 1900's attention. When it does, Max attempts to convince 1900 to leave the ship. But he is too daunted by the size of the world. Feeling that his fate is tied to the ship, 1900 cannot bring himself to leave the only home he has known. Max feels useless that he couldn't save his friend.  The shopkeeper asks Max how the record got into the secondhand piano. Max indicates that he put it there, and the shopkeeper tells him that he wasn't so useless after all. Then, as Max is leaving the store, the shopkeeper gives him the trumpet and says, "A good story is worth more than an old trumpet," and Max walks out as another customer walks in.  
Legionnaire (film)
 Alain Lefevre ([[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]) is a French boxer in 1920s [[Marseille]], France. Alain is forced by local crime boss Lucien Galgani ([[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]]) to take a dive in a fight. Galgani's girlfriend Katrina (Ana Sofrenovic) is also Alain's ex-fiancée whom he left standing at the altar. But Katrina forgives Alain, and the two hatch a plan to run off to America together.  Alain does not take a dive in the fight, but just as the escape plan is about to succeed, Alain's friend is killed, and Katrina is captured by Galgani's men. But Alain has shot and killed Galgani's brother. Desperately needing a new escape plan, Alain signs up for the [[French Foreign Legion]], and is shipped to North Africa to help defend [[Morocco]] against a native [[Berber people|Berber]] [[Rif War|rebellion]] of [[Riffian people|Rif]] warriors, led by [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd el-Krim]].  Along the way, Alain meets some new friends, including Luther, an African American who has fled injustice in the States, Mackintosh, a former British Army Major with a gambling problem, and Guido, a naive Italian boy who wishes to impress his girl back home by returning as a hero. But things will not be easy. The only real way to escape from the Legion is to survive the term of service, and the rebels have them outnumbered.  Galgani has sent his hired thugs into the Legion as well, to find Alain and get revenge for the death of Galgani's brother. In the end, only Alain stands up alive after the battle and [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd el-Krim]] seeing Alain's courage and determination allows him to live and tells him to inform his superiors what's waiting for them if they continue the colonization. Now the only survivor of the ordeal, Alain is left alone in the desert as he remembers Katrina and his former friends. There is the alternate/deleted ending when Alain rescues Katrina and is to originally kill Galgani but doesn't as the director and producer walking on set felt it was too violent.

The Lion King II: Simba's Pride
   In the Pride Lands of Africa, King Simba and Queen Nala's newborn daughter, Kiara, is presented to the assembled animals by Rafiki, a baboon who serves as shaman and advisor. Simba's father Mufasa proudly watches over the ceremony from the Heavens above. Kiara becomes annoyed with her father's overprotective parenting. Simba assigns Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog, to follow her. Kiara ignores her father's warning and the duo's attention and enters the "Outlands," where she meets a young cub, Kovu, and they escape from crocodiles while befriending each other. When Kovu retaliates to Kiara's playing, Simba confronts the young cub just as he is confronted by Zira, Kovu's mother and the Outsiders' leader. Zira reminds Simba of how he exiled her and the other Outsiders, and she reveals that Scar selected Kovu to be his successor despite not being his biological father.  After returning to the Pride Lands, Nala and the rest of the pride head back to Pride Rock while Simba lectures Kiara about the danger posed by the Outsiders. He then tells her that they are a part of each other. In the Outlands, Zira reminds Kovu that Simba killed Scar and exiled the lionesses who respected him. Kovu explains that he does not think it is so bad to have Kiara as a friend, but Zira realizes she can use Kovu's friendship with Kiara to seek revenge on Simba.  Several years later, Kiara, now a young adult, begins her first solo hunt. Simba has Timon and Pumbaa follow her in secret, causing her to hunt away from the Pride Lands. As part of Zira's plan, Kovu's siblings Nuka and Vitani trap Kiara in a fire, allowing Kovu to rescue her. Unable to thank the young rogue, Simba is forced to accept Kovu's place since he rescued Kiara. Later that night, Simba has a nightmare about attempting to save Mufasa from falling into the wildebeest stampede but is stopped by Scar who then morphs into Kovu and sends Simba to his death.  The next day, Kovu contemplates attacking Simba as he was instructed to, but he teaches Kiara how to hunt instead and eventually realizes his feelings for her. Later, Kiara and Kovu stargaze where they talk about the Great Kings of the Past and Kovu wonders if there is a darkness in him like there was in Scar. Simba watches the two from afar and Nala convinces him to give Kovu a chance. Kovu attempts to reveal his mission to Kiara, but Rafiki interrupts and leads them to the jungle, where he introduces them to "upendi" (an erroneous form of [[wikt:upendo|''upendo'']], which means "love" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]). The two lions fall in love. That night, Simba allows Kovu to sleep inside Pride Rock with the rest of the pride, but Vitani tells Zira about Kovu's failure to kill Simba. Zira sets a trap for her son and Simba.  The next day, Kovu attempts to reveal his mission to Kiara, but Simba takes him around the Pride Lands and tells him the real story of how Scar died.

Little Voice (film)
 Laura Hoff, an only child, is a reclusive young woman who lives with her mother in a working-class home in [[Scarborough, Yorkshire]], England. She is known as LV (short for Little Voice) for her reticence. She flees reality, hiding away in her bedroom, listening to records and mimicking their artists' voices like [[Gracie Fields]]’, [[Judy Garland]]’s, and [[Shirley Bassey]]’s; her love of songs is her only source of strength since her beloved father's death. Her mother Mari, a [[promiscuous]] woman with countless affairs, jilts a man when her passion wanes.  Billy, a telephone engineer who mends their phone, approaches LV by giving her information pamphlets. Things improve when Mari is seeing Ray; he hears the girl sing, spots her gift and vows to make her a star, while Mari, who dislikes singing, still doubts her child. Ray arranges with Mr Boo for LV to sing at his club. But her performance is understandably somewhat of a failure as she is overcome by stage fright and only manages a few lines of song. Ray sees that LV needs encouragement on stage and organises a big band, lights and a new dress to give her confidence.  Ray gives her a pep talk, persuading her to perform by portraying her act as a tribute to her father. LV, therefore, agrees to sing again, but only as a one-off.  When LV is to sing at a nightclub, she envisions her father to help perform well. LV brings the house down and is a storming success. Ray thinks she is his ticket to the big time and arranges for a London agent to come up and see LV perform the following night. As Ray, Mari and Mr Boo toast their future success, LV murmurs that she agreed to sing only the one time and slumps to the floor.  The following night LV passively remains in her bed and Ray’s futile attempts to goad LV are dashed. Mari, who still scorns her child, prods her against her will. The selfish natures of Ray and Mari are very much revealed in these scenes. At the cabaret club the London agent finally loses patience after several third rate acts fill the time in LV's absence and leaves. Ray storms into the club and sings [[It's Over (Roy Orbison song)|"It's Over"]] on stage, as his career disappears before everyone's eyes.  Meanwhile, the faulty wiring at LV's home finally starts a fire, trapping LV in her upper room where she is rescued by Billy. In a final showdown with her mother, after being  wrongly accused by her mother of arson, LV responds by screaming in her mother's face, blaming Mari for her father’s death and her (LV's) meek nature with her domineering attitude. She walks away saying her name isn't Little Voice, it's Laura.  Mari is left by everyone; Ray is facing his debt-collectors, and LV is saved by Billy.

 Richard Shorkinghorn (David Wenham) is a researcher investigating progeria in chickens, and believes his findings could have implications for human aging, but his applications for further funding are rejected. He receives intimations of support from philanthropist Grace Michael (Heather Mitchell), whose husband Godfrey Usher (Geoffrey Rush) is Federal Treasurer, and accepts an invitation to a weekend at their country estate. Complicating matters, Richard's ex-assistant and ex-girlfriend, Kate Haslett (Frances O'Connor), who left him to pursue the same line of research, is competing for funding and is a fellow guest. Kate is apparently at home among the trappings of wealth and privilege, and a hit with their hosts, to Richard's discomfiture.  After a boozy dinner Godfrey confesses to Richard that he has no understanding of economics, and his wife makes a clumsy attempt to seduce him.  Following the apparent suicide of Sue Harrington, a fellow guest who is not seen, their hosts confessed to being Satanists, and give a million dollar research grant to Richard and Kate, who subsequently marry. The research results in discovery of a virus which can control the aging process, which to Grace's extreme annoyance Richard refuses to divulge, and she proceeds to sacrifice Richard and Kate according to some kind of demonic ritual. They are saved by Dr. Sommerville, a Satanist who was once Kate's fortune-teller.  Godfrey (by now Prime Minister) passes to the police evidence that Richard murdered Sue Harrington, but at the trial defence lawyer Peter Duncan unnerves him with a series of questions on economics. Godfrey at first has his standard replies, then, further confused, resorts to nihilism theory and demonism, morphing into contempt for ordinary mortals and a triumphant admission he was the murderer.  Richard and Kate never publish; instead they open a small pharmacy, where they have a limited supply of unlabelled bottles they pass on to selected customers.

Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels
 Long-time friends and small-time criminals Eddy, Tom, Soap, and Bacon put together £100,000 so that Eddy, a genius [[card sharp]], can buy into one of "Hatchet" Harry Lonsdale's high-stakes [[three card brag]] games. The game is rigged however, and the friends end up massively indebted to Harry for £500,000. Harry then sends his debt collector Big Chris, who is often accompanied by his beloved son, Little Chris, to ensure that the debt is honoured within a week.  Harry is also interested in a pair of expensive antique shotguns that are up for auction, and gets his enforcer Barry "the Baptist" to hire a couple of thieves, Gary and Dean, to steal them from a bankrupt lord. The two turn out to be highly incompetent and unwittingly sell the shotguns to Nick "the Greek", a local [[fence (criminal)|fence]]. After learning this, an enraged Barry threatens the two into getting the guns back. Eddy returns home one day and overhears his neighbours — a gang of robbers led by a brutal man called "Dog" — planning a heist on some [[cannabis]] growers loaded with cash and drugs. Eddy relays this information to the group, intending for them to rob the neighbours as they come back from their heist. In preparation for the robbery, Tom buys the antique shotguns from Nick the Greek.  The neighbours' heist gets under way, and despite a gang member being killed by his own [[Bren Gun]], and an incriminating encounter with a traffic warden, the job is a success; they return home with a duffel bag filled with money and a van loaded with bags of marijuana. Eddy and his friends ambush them as planned, and later return to stash their loot next door. They then have Nick fence the drugs to Rory Breaker, a gangster with a reputation for violence. Rory agrees to the deal, but later learns that the drugs were stolen from his own growers. Rory threatens Nick into giving him Eddy's address, and brings along one of the growers, Winston, to identify the robbers.  Eddy and his friends spend the night at Eddy's father's bar to celebrate. Meanwhile, Dog's crew accidentally learns that their neighbours are the ones that robbed them, and set up an ambush in Eddy's flat. Rory and his gang arrive instead and a shootout ensues, resulting in the deaths of all but Dog and Winston. Winston leaves with the drugs; Dog leaves with the two shotguns and the money but is waylaid by Big Chris, who knocks him out and takes everything. Gary and Dean, having learned who bought the shotguns and not knowing that Chris works for Harry, follows Chris to Harry's place. Chris delivers the money and guns to Harry, but when he returns to his car he finds Dog holding Little Chris at knife point, demanding the money be returned to him. Chris complies and starts the car. Meanwhile, Gary and Dean burst into Harry's office, starting a confrontation that ends up killing them both, and Harry and Barry as well.  Returning to see the carnage at their flat and their loot missing, Eddy and his friends head to Harry's, but when they discover Harry's corpse they decide to take the money for themselves. Before they are able to leave, Chris crashes into their car to disable Dog, and then brutally bludgeons him to death with his car door. He then takes the debt money back from the unconscious friends, but allows Tom to leave with the antique shotguns after a brief standoff in Harry's office.  The friends are arrested, but declared innocent of recent events after the traffic warden identifies Dog and his crew as the culprits. Back at the bar, they send Tom out to dispose of the only evidence connecting them to the case: the antique shotguns. Chris then arrives to give back the duffel bag, from which he has taken all the money for himself and his son, and which is empty except for a catalogue of antique weapons. After leafing through the catalogue, the friends learn that the shotguns are actually quite valuable, and quickly call Tom. The film ends with Tom's mobile phone, stuffed in his mouth, ringing as he hangs over the side of a bridge, preparing to drop the shotguns into the [[River Thames]].  
Lost in Space (film)
   In 2058, [[Earth]] will be uninhabitable within twenty years due to the irreversible effects of [[pollution]] and [[ozone depletion]]. In an effort to save humanity, the United Global Space Force (UGSF) elects to send Professor John Robinson and his family—wife Maureen, daughters Judy and Penny, and young prodigy son Will—on a mission on the spaceship ''Jupiter II'' to complete the construction of a hypergate over the planet Alpha Prime, allowing for the population of Earth to be instantly transported to and populate it as a new home. Penny is resistant to leaving, rebelling by breaking curfew, while Will's prize-winning science experiment involving time travel goes largely unnoticed by John. Global Sedition, a [[terrorist]] group against the mission, assassinates the ''Jupiter II'''s pilot, and hotshot fighter pilot Major Don West is instead recruited to fly their ship—much to his chagrin.  Dr. Zachary Smith, the family's physician, turns out to be a spy for the Sedition, who sabotages the ship's on-board robot before launch, but he is betrayed by his cohorts, and left unconscious as the ship launches and the family enters [[cryosleep]]. The robot activates soon after and begins to destroy the navigation and guidance systems, en route to destroying the family itself. Smith awakens the Robinsons and West, who manage to subdue the robot, but the ship is falling uncontrollably into the sun. Forced to use the experimental hyperdrive, which has an unpredictable trajectory, the ship is transported through hyperspace to a planet in a remote and uncharted part of the universe, where their known star charts are useless. Going through a strange distortion in space, the crew finds two abandoned ships in orbit, the ''Proteus'', an Earth ship, and another ship that is clearly not of human origin. They board the ''Proteus'', with Will controlling the now-modified robot by remote control to aid them. They find navigational data that can be used to get to Alpha Prime along with a camouflaging creature whom Penny calls "Blarp", and evidence suggesting the ship is from decades in the future. They are attacked by spider-like creatures; in their escape, Smith is scratched by one, and the robot's body is damaged beyond repair, but Will saves its computerized intelligence. West destroys the vessel to eradicate the spiders, and, as a result, the ship crash-lands on the nearby planet, where the strange distortions from before continue. Will theorizes that they are distortions in time; in fact, they are his science experiment's predicted results. John, however, frustrates Will by ignoring his input. He and West head off to explore one of these time bubbles, and encounter a future version of Will, who explains that some spiders had survived and attacked after his father and West had left them, and that Maureen, Penny, and Judy were all killed. Constructing a time machine, Will intends to go back to Earth to prevent ''Jupiter II'' from launching.  Meanwhile, young Will and Smith head out on their own to investigate the time bubble. Smith tricks Will into handing over his weapon, but he is foiled by a future version of Smith, who had been protecting Will ever since the rest of the family was killed, and was transformed by an infection from the spider injury into a kind of anthropomorphic spider creature. Will and West return to their time with an injured Smith in tow, while the future Smith reveals his true actions: He had killed the Robinsons, but kept Will alive to build the time machine, so he could go back in time to populate Earth with a race of space spiders. John remembers that the spiders eat their wounded, rips open Smith's egg sac with a trophy Will had turned into a weapon, and while Smith's own army devours him, he is thrown into the time portal, which rips him apart. The increasing instability of the planet caused by the portal forces the ''Jupiter II'' to take off, but they are unable to reach escape velocity, and are destroyed by the planet's debris. Will realizes that his father never actually abandoned them, and that he really does love him after all. Setting the time machine's controls to send John back to his family, he himself is unable to go along, with only enough power available for one person. Saying goodbye to his family, the future Will is killed by falling debris, and John reunites with his living family. Realizing that they do not have enough power to escape the planet's gravitational pull, John suggests that drive the ship down through the planet, and use the gravity well to slingshot them back into space. They are successful, but the planet turns into a black hole, and the Robinsons once again activate the hyperdrive to escape. Using the navigational data from the ''Proteus'' to set a potential course for Alpha Prime, the ship blasts off into hyperspace.

They want to have a relationship like real couples have, even though they know it is prohibited they found a place where they can see each other at night. As time passes by their parents get divorced and they get separated. Ana's mother moves abroad, and Ana travels to Finland from where she persuades Otto to travel north to look for her. The deaths and lives of the characters are made more confusing through [[anachronism]]s and plot details.  The movie ends on an ambiguous note: in one version, Ana and Otto are reunited, while in the other Ana dies in a car accident. It is unclear which of the endings is real.

Agnes considers her privacy important, but shows flashes of a high-spirited nature among those she trusts, and enjoys scandalizing the locals by being a divorced woman who smokes, drinks, and rides horses astride on her vast property. When James discovers that a local land agent has been cheating Agnes, he shares the information with her. She's grateful to him and they get to know each other a bit better, leading in time to a romantic relationship. James is younger than she is, and beneath her social status, but Agnes is a woman who thrives on being seen as scandalous, so she enters into the affair with relish and delight. James is a wild man, as well as a bit of a con artist, appearing at the estate in disguise and meeting Agnes dressed as a priest. Agnes doesn't appear to mind this, and at times even actively welcomes it. The fact that they both seem to delight in taunting "proper" society seems to please her that much more.  James soon begins displaying a rather unusual bent. As time passes his wild behavior becomes more and more erratic, and eventually it becomes downright scary. What starts as erotic play-acting grows into something more sinister, and in time James's actions become less amusing and more threatening.

During the escape, The cats encounter Bubulina, which Zorba is enamored and leaves. Meanwhile, at the ocean, a petrol ship sinks leaving a lot of petrol in the sea. The next day a seagull flock starts looking for fish in the sea, they dive in and stay there until their leader spots the petrol flood, he warns the rest of the flock, but one of the seagulls named Kengah doesn't hear it and gets dirtied by the petrol. She survives the accident but has trouble with flying. She flies over the city until she falls on a woman's garden, right on top of her cat Zorba. Being disgusted by the petrol taste Zorba refuses to eat her. Kengah asks him three promises that he must do if she doesn't survive. The first one is that when she lays her egg he must not eat it, the second one is that he must take care of it until it hatches, and third is that he would teach the newborn how to fly.  Zorba promises despite his hesitations, then he goes to find his friends to try to help save Kengah with removing the oil. Zorba gets his friends but when they arrive to save the seagull, it's too late. Under her wing they find her egg, so Zorba tells them about the promise and the cats decide to help him by giving him some instructions (found in encyclopedias in a nearby abandoned museum) on taking care of the egg. Zorba then forces himself to gently sit on the egg and hatch it.  Word soon spreads about a cat hatching a bird's egg, until it reaches the ears of Zorba's love interest Bubulina and the town's cats' arch-enemy Great Big Rat, who after hearing the news of the cat-egg makes a plan to make all the town's cats his servants. The egg soon hatches and the cats decide to name the newborn Lucky. Lucky lives with the cats believing to be a cat herself. Her belief soon disappears when YoYo, a red kitten jealous of Lucky because of all the attention and advantages she gets, tells her that she's a bird and that her adoptive father wants to eat her.  Lucky runs away and gets captured by Great Big Rat's minions.  The cats look for her all over the town until they found out that Great Big Rat has her captured.  The cats build a big cheese and hide in it (a trick they learned from the [[Trojan Horse]]). YoYo however goes alone into the sewers and stops the rats before they can eat Lucky, but both of them end up captured. The cat's cheese arrives just in time as the cats jump out and rescue Lucky and YoYo right before Great Big Rat could kill them. The cats throw Great Big Rat and his main henchman into the canals.  Zorba and his friends then decide to teach Lucky how to fly. Lucky fails to successfully fly until Zorba decides to teach her to fly as a seagull mother would. For this Zorba asks Bubulina's owner, a little girl named Nina, to take them to a very high tower where Lucky could jump from the top and, according to her instincts, be able to fly. Despite that cats talking to humans in the same language is forbidden, Zorba tells Nina in Her dreams. Lucky tells Zorba that she loves him, calling him by his name for the first time, and he tells her that he loves her, too. The plan succeeds and Lucky starts flying. The Great Big Rat sees the commotion and becomes enraged that his plan failed. Before she leaves she (Lucky) grabs YoYo and brings him to Zorba. Lucky then says good-bye to Zorba.

Izzy has no idea what he's talking about, but Van Horn seems to know details about Izzy's past—his real name, childhood incidents, and catching fireflies with his brother at their summer house on Echo Lake. When Van Horn begins to delve into Izzy's relationships with his father and brother, Izzy responds, "Don't do this to me." When reminded that he refused to play music at his father's funeral, he breaks down in tears. One night, Van Horn storms into Izzy's cell and tell him, "You're not worthy. You've lived a bad dishonest life." Having learned about Celia, Van horn now demands that Izzy reveal her whereabouts. Izzy refuses to acknowledge that he even knows her. As he leaves, Van Horn says, "May God have mercy on your soul."  Meanwhile, Celia is unable to reach Izzy and she suspects that something is very wrong. She fears that Izzy has abandoned her. One night she takes out the rock and the blue light appears, but now it only produces in her an overwhelming sadness. Distressed, Lulu takes the rock and walks to [[Ha'penny Bridge]], where she drops the stone into the dark river below. The following day, Van Horn and his men find Celia in Dublin and attempt to kidnap her. They chase her through the streets to Ha'penny Bridge where she had dropped the stone. As they close in, she jumps into the river.  Back in New York, Izzy finally manages to escape his prison. He learns from the producer of Celia's disappearance and nearly collapses. The producer gives him a videotape of some of Celia's scenes. Later at a jazz club, he asks his friends, "Am I a good person or a bad person?" Back at his apartment he watches the videotape of Celia and weeps.  After being shot at the jazz club by the deranged man, Izzy is taken away in an ambulance. On the way to the hospital, his heart stops and Izzy Maurer dies, just as the ambulance passes a young aspiring actress named Celia Burns. She sees the ambulance pass and makes the sign of the cross.  
Mafia!
 Like ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', the narrative of ''Mafia!'' consists of a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s interwoven with the main plot. Tony is the son of a prominent Mafia don, Vincenzo Armani Windbreaker Cortino. As the film opens, Tony introduces the main thread when he exits a Vegas casino and walks to his car, accompanied by a voiceover explaining his philosophy of life. When he starts the car, it explodes.   The story then regresses more than half a century to describe the boyhood of Tony's father, Vincenzo, who was born in Italy, the clumsy son of a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] postman. One day, while making a delivery for his father, Vincenzo trips and the parcel bursts open, revealing a strange white powder. The parcel's recipient, concluding that the delivery boy has seen too much, tracks Vincenzo to a street fair, where he kills his father.  The boy escapes to America, where he grows to young manhood, marries, and struggles with poverty before finally finding his destiny as a mafia boss.   The film then visits the recent past; Tony has just returned from the [[Korean War]] and is bringing his idealistic Protestant girlfriend, Diane, to meet his family and friends at his big brother Joey's wedding reception (a parody of Connie Corleone's wedding in the beginning of ''[[The Godfather]]''). During the festivities, however, Vincenzo is shot 47 times in an attempted hit and nearly dies. Tony announces his intention to kill Gorgoni, a drug lord with whom Vincenzo had refused to do business before the attack. Diane leaves him, saying he's abandoned the peaceful ideals of his youth, and adding that she'll never be anything to his Sicilian family but "that Protestant chick who never killed anyone." Tony avenges the attack, then goes into hiding in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], where Cesar Marzoni offers him the opportunity to manage his casino, The Peppermill.  Tony accepts and his casino is a great success until he meets a [[femme fatale]], Pepper Gianini, hired by Marzoni as part of a deep-laid plan to distract him from his duties and to drive a wedge between him and Joey.   Vincenzo recovers from his 47 gunshot wounds and visits Las Vegas, where he officially names Tony his successor.  Joey, furious at being passed over, is told "You get Wisconsin." The Don then returns home, where he falls victim to his 5-year-old grandson, Chucky, who assassinates him by spraying him with [[malathion]] (parody of Vito Corleone's heart attack in ''The Godfather''). The film returns to the present after Tony catches Joey and Pepper cavorting in a hotel room together and walks out in disgust - only to have his car explode.   Tony is horribly but temporarily disfigured, and attends his father's funeral in a wheelchair, where he spots the killers when he sees little Chucky taking a payoff. However, he decides to postpone vengeance until he can win back Diane's love and put his life in order. Diane has by this time become [[President of the United States]], and is on the brink of declaring total world disarmament when Tony goes looking for her. He persuades her to put world peace on the back burner until after their wedding. During the ceremony, with the help of Vincenzo's mother (Dukakis), several henchmen, and an Eskimo, he settles the family's accounts in an orgy of slaughter (filmed similarly to the end of ''The Godfather''), even arranging [[anti-Barney humor|the harpooning of Barney the dinosaur]] as a bonus.  
The Magic Pipe
 A grandfather tells his grandson a bedtime story about the ancient [[Nart saga|Narts]].  There is a very respected Nart named Saynag-Aldar who lives in a castle on a hill, and he has a beautiful daughter named Agunda who has eyes for no-one but herself. In a nearby village lives a shepherd named Atsamaz who was given a magic pipe by a god.  Though he loves Agunda, only the pipe's music shows his love.  One day, Saynag-Aldar decides that he has had enough, and vows to find a husband for his daughter. He proclaims a contest to see who among the Narts is the most fit, with the gods in heaven deciding the winner. The famous [[bogatyr]] [[Soslan]] is among the challengers.  The first part of the contest is marksmanship: challengers must hit the bull's-eye with an arrow while riding on a horse. None of them manage to do it, until Atsamaz. However, Soslan comes last, ridding very slowly and mockingly, and shooting backwards, but still his arrow pierces Atsamaz's arrow in half. The gods proclaim Soslan the winner.  The second contest involves dexterity. Atsamaz manages to dance on the edge of a large bowl without spilling any of the liquid inside. However, Soslan dances on the tops of a number of knives which he throws onto a wooden board, and the gods proclaim him the winner.  The third contest involves strength. Soslan lifts up and throws a huge boulder to Atsamaz across a deep chasm. Atsamaz manages to catch it and throw it back, but is unable to throw it all the way back to Soslan. The gods proclaim Soslan the winner. As Soslan basks in his glory, he boasts that no-one in the world is stronger than him. Agunda, who realizes that she doesn't want to marry such a braggart, asks her father to make him prove this. Saynad-Aldar agrees, and sends Soslan away to travel the world and search for anyone who is his match. He makes Atsamaz accompany him, so that he may back up his account.  Before they leave, Agunda hears the music of Atsamaz's pipe, and follows its sound. As he plays, animals stop to listen and flowers emerge from the snow. They meet, and he tells her that the music is for her. Agunda asks Atsamaz to give her his pipe as a symbol of his love, but he refuses, explaining that it is a present from the gods. When she tells him that this means he doesn't love her, Atsamaz breaks the pipe in anger and storms away. Agunda regrets her words, gathers up the pieces of the pipe, and goes back to the castle. As Atsamaz gets ready to throw himself off a cliff, Soslan catches up with him and reminds him that he must accompany him on his journey.  They venture out into the proud tribes that surround the lands of the Narts, and defeat all whom they come across. Finally, they come across a burial site for fallen Narts, where gods are said to grant wishes. Atsamaz suggests that they should leave an offering, but Soslan declines, saying that they have not helped him, and that he will give them 100 deer if they will find him a worthy adversary. Unknown to Soslan, the gods hear his wish.  They transport the two of them to a faraway land, where gigantic man-eating [[cyclops]] live.  Soslan walks up to one of them, named Uaig, and challenges him.  Uaig laughs at them, and asks Soslan to try to pull out one of the hairs on the bottom of his leg. When Soslan is unable to do this, he sends them to a cave where they may find a "more worthy adversary".  As they come into the cave, they are grabbed by Uaig's mother.  While Soslan tries to challenge her as well, Atsamaz says "let this day bring you fortune, part of my mother". Upon hearing this, she lets them down and says that they are her guests for the day. She hides them in her dress. When Uaig comes into the cave, she feeds him a broth and puts him to sleep, and then transports Soslan and Atsamaz back to their homeland.  However, Uaig sees them go, and follows them. He comes to the valley of the Narts and causes destruction; nobody is able to stop him. A god comes to Agunda, rejoins the broken pieces of the pipe, and tells her to give the pipe to Atsamaz. She does this, and Atsamaz begins to play his melody. The song disorients Uaig, and allows Soslan to shoot an arrow which goes straight through his one eye, causing him to crumble. Soslan proudly declares victory, but there is silence in the valley; all around him are the dead and the dying.  Finally, after the Narts rebuild, Agunda is wed to Atsamaz. Soslan concedes that there is a power which is stronger than him: love.

Madeline (1998 film)
  In 1956 [[Paris, France]], a young girl named Madeline attends a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] boarding school, taught by the strict but loving [[nun]] Miss Clavel and fed by the passionate French chef Hélène. Unlike her classmates, Madeline is an [[orphan]], coming from neither family nor [[money]], but maintains a positive attitude and has a mischievous streak in her. She is friendly towards the other girls, particularly Aggie, whom she considers her best friend, and has somewhat of a rivalry with the pompous Vicki.  Early in the film, Madeline is stricken with [[appendicitis]] and Miss Clavel immediately escorts her to the [[hospital]], where Madeline undergoes an emergency [[appendectomy]]. During her stay there, five days after the operation, Madeline meets Lady Covington, the [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] wife of the school's board of [[trustee]]'s member, Lord "Cucuface" Covington. Unlike her husband, Lady Covington is a kind-hearted person who cares deeply for the school and the girls, having attended the school herself in her youth. Before Madeline's presence is discovered by Lord Covington, Lady Covington asks a favor of Madeline; as a child, she carved her birth name, Marie Gilbert, into one of the dorm's bed frames and she would like for Madeline to find out if her name is still there. Unfortunately, a few days later, when Madeline is ready to leave the hospital, she learns from Miss Clavel that Lady Covington has passed away as she prepares to leave the hospital but, true to her promise, searches for her name under the beds, finding it under her own.  After her hospital stay, Madeine finds that the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[ambassador]] has purchased the property next door to the school and that he also has a son, Pepito, who is around Madeline's age. While the other girls are smitten with Pepito, Madeline is far from impressed and irritated by the noise created by the boy riding around on his [[Vespa]]. Much to Miss Clavel's chagrin, Madeline causes an uproar among the girls at the dinner table that evening, when Hélène serves her namesake dish, Chicken Hélène, as, on the car ride home from the hospital, Madeline befriended the chicken with which Hélène made the dish, naming him Fred. With the exception of Vicki, Madeline turns almost all of the other girls against chicken, making them [[vegetarianism|vegetarians]] and cluck, and they are sent to bed without dinner and later that night, everyone sneaks downstairs to make their own dinner. However, their plans are interrupted when Pepito pranks the girls by wearing a scary mask. After their screams alert Miss Clavel and Hélène, the two women, distraught over news that Lord Covincton plans to close the school due to his wife's passing, nevertheless give the girls a late-night dinner.  Miss Clavel, unnerved by Pepito's bothering her girls, attempts to make peace with the boy by giving his tutor, Leopold, a tool box for him, in hopes that it will distract him and help put an end to his obnoxious ways. However, her actions are less than successful as Pepito takes it upon himself to steal Madeline's drawing pad and write "Beware" with a vicious drawing in it before inviting the girls to his birthday party. During the party, Pepito tries to unnerve his guests by showing them a mouse but is unsuccessful in unnerving Madeline. Undeterred, Pepito threatens to kill the mouse, either by feeding him to his [[snake]] or [[execution|executing]] him using a [[guillotine]] he made using the tool box he'd received as a gift from Miss Clavel. Madeline, angered by Pepito's threats to harm the tiny animal, brutally attacks him and releases all of his mice, causing guests to flee in horror and Miss Clavel to faint, which results in the girls' visit getting cut short, much to Pepito's delight. On the way back to the school, Madeline takes Pepito's keys in an act of revenge, preventing him from riding his noisy scooter around the grounds.  While out on a daily walk, Madeline accidentally falls into the [[Seine]] while standing on the ledge of a bridge going over the river and is whisked away by the current. She is rescued by a [[stray dog]], whom she names Genevieve, and emerges from the ordeal relatively unscathed, save for a cold. While sick in bed, Madeline is displeased to watch Leopold teach Pepito, frustrated over the loss of his keys, how to start his scooter with a paper clip. However, her anger disperses when she discovers that Genevieve has followed her to the school and convinces Miss Clavel to let her golden haired savior live in the shed. Wanting to save the school Madeline forms an alliance with Pepito, enlisting his help to sabotage Lord Covington's attempts to sell the property but her efforts are ultimately discovered by Lord Covington, who initially blames Miss Clavel. Madeline takes responsibility for her involvement, though Lord Covington is unmoved by her apology or the motivation behind her actions when she makes a [[Freudian slip]] and calls him "Cucuface" and, after leaving, he sets Genevieve loose into the night in an act of retaliation against her and the girls.  Upset over the loss of Genevieve, Miss Clavel takes the girls to a local [[circus]] in hopes of cheering them up and Madeline, fearing she'll have no place to go as an orphan once the school closes, makes the decision to join the circus, hoping to make friends and find a home within the community there. After telling Aggie of her plans and making her swear not to tell, Madeline leaves the group and unintentionally stumbles upon Leopold, with the help of a trio of [[clowns]] known as "The Idiots," kidnapping Pepito, hoping to hold him from ransom, and, due to her discovery, is abducted as well. Luckily, Leopold and the Idiots leave the two children alone with a motorcycle, which Madeline uses her hair clip to start and convinces Pepito to drive, though he is initially reluctant as he's never driven one, only a Vespa. The two are pursued by Leopold and the Idiots but Miss Clavel, having learned of Madeline's running away from Aggie, goes driving in search of her and, narrowly avoiding a collision with the two children on the bike, is able to cause the Idiots to crash into a lake. The police arrive and arrest the kidnappers.  Back at the school, Lord Covington appears and happily shares that he's sold the property to the ambassador of [[Uzbekistan]]. Madeline realises that Lord Covington is merely tryingv to sell the school due to his grief over his wife. He at first dismisses her sympathy but Madeleine speaks earnestly to Lord Covington about her own family being gone and says that Lady Covington is still with him and with the school and Miss Clavel, knowing Madeline is fearful of having no one if the school were to shut down, assures her that they'll be together, regardless of what happens. While Lord Covington is moved by Madeline's words and sincerity, he regretfully tells her and the girls that there's nothing he can do as he's already sold the property but, in a happy twist, the ambassador, also moved by Madeline, decides to back out of the sale. Hélène decides to celebrate by fixing a vegetarian feast, to which Madeline responds and that she wants Chicken Hélène, with the girls squawking in agreement. The film then concludes with a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]], accompanied by "[[What a Wonderful World]]", and then changes back to a book setting, as the French word, "fin" (meaning "the end") appears.

Then, Roger recruits Gus to be the manager of the Buzz, the Twins' [[Triple-A (baseball)|AAA]] [[minor league]] affiliate. Gus's mission is to make a real team out of a bunch of players who include ballet dancer turned ballplayer Lance "The Dance" Pere, minor league lifer Frank "Pops" Morgan, Rube Baker, Taka Tanaka, Pedro Cerrano, pitcher Hog Ellis, home run hitter Billy "Downtown" Anderson, and pitcher Carlton "Doc" Windgate, a medical school graduate who throws the slowest fastball in the minors.  However, Gus clashes with Leonard Huff, the snobby manager of the Twins. One night in Minnesota, Gus and his fiancee Maggie Reynolds are having dinner with Roger and Huff at an expensive-looking restaurant, where Huff challenges Gus to a game between the Buzz and the Twins and Gus accepts the challenge.  The game is scheduled to take place at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in Minnesota. The Twins take a 3-0 lead in the 6th inning, but Downtown hits a home run that ties the game at 3-3 in the 8th inning.  But in the bottom of the 9th inning, with two outs, while the Twins are up to bat, and Doc is one strike away from striking out home run hitter Carlos Liston, Huff has the stadium's lights turned off so the game can end with a tie rather than give the Buzz a chance to win in extra innings. However, the media says that the Twins were still outplayed by the Buzz.  Huff now wants to bring Downtown up to the Twins, even though Gus believes that he is not yet ready. However, Anderson jumps on the opportunity, turning his back on Gus. Without Downtown, the Buzz start losing again. With the Twins, Anderson starts hitting poorly, proving Huff wrong. Gus manages to get the Buzz back on track, and Downtown is sent back down to the Buzz, where Gus teaches him how to get more hits. Gus leads the Buzz to a division title in their league.  Gus issues a challenge for Huff to bring the Twins to Buzz Stadium for another game. If the Twins win, Gus will give his salary for the year to Huff. If Gus and the Buzz beat the Twins, Gus can take over as the manager of the Twins. Huff accepts the challenge and takes the Twins to play against the Buzz. This time, the Twins take a 4-0 lead in the 6th inning, but the Buzz still manage to come from behind with three runs, and then win the game, 5-4, thanks to a game-winning two-run home run by Downtown.

The Man in the Iron Mask (1998 film)
 In 1662, the [[Kingdom of France]] faces [[Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] from [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV's]] wars against the Dutch, which has left the country's agriculture impeded by a heavy tax burden and forced the citizens to live on rotten food. Though the country appears to be on the verge of a revolution, Louis continues to spend his time preparing for war and seducing countless women. The three musketeers have gone their separate ways; [[Aramis]] is now an aging priest, [[Porthos]] has become a philandering drunk, and [[Athos (character)|Athos]] is retired and living with his only son, Raoul, who aspires to join the [[Musketeers of the Guard|Musketeers]]. Only [[Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan|D'Artagnan]] has remained with the Musketeers, now serving as their Captain.  At a festival, Aramis learns that the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit order]] has declared Louis's wars unjust and the source of public hunger and outrage. Louis personally instructs Aramis to secretly hunt down and kill the Jesuit leader. Also in attendance are Raoul and his fiancé, Christine Bellefort. Louis immediately sets his sights on Christine, but she resists his affections. A Jesuit assassin attempts to kill Louis but is stopped by D'Artagnan. Louis immediately plots to seduce Christine by having Raoul sent to the battlefront. D'Artagnan visits Athos to warn him of the danger Raoul faces. But then Raoul arrives and informs his father he has been recalled to his regiment because he believes Louis desires Christine. Raoul nevertheless resolves to go because he will not risk making Christine a widow nor consider himself a coward. Athos angrily warns D'Artagnan that if Raoul is harmed, then Louis will become his enemy. He states D'Artagnan doesn't understand fatherhood. D'Artagnan tells Athos he will personally speak to Louis about Raoul.  An angry crowd from Paris attacks the Musketeers when they are fed rotten food, but D'Artagnan calms the crowd and says he will personally speak to Louis about public hunger. Louis assures D'Artagnan he will deal with the matter, and that Raoul will return soon from the war. Instead, Louis orders his chief adviser executed for distributing the rotten food (which Louis earlier ordered him to distribute), and orders that all rioters are to be shot from now on. Raoul joins the war and is killed at the battlefront by cannon fire. Upon learning of his son's death, Athos attempts to kill Louis but is stopped by D'Artagnan, and goes into exile. Louis invites Christine to the royal palace and coerces her into sex by promising to have his personal doctor treat her sick mother and sister and has them sent to recover at his country estate.   Aramis summons Porthos, Athos and D'Artagnan for a secret meeting in which he reveals that he himself is the Jesuits' leader and has a plan to depose Louis. Athos and Porthos agree, but D'Artagnan refuses citing his oath of honor cannot be removed or betrayed. Athos angrily confronts D'Artagnan over his devotion and loyalty to Louis, but D'Artagnan still refuses to join their plot. Athos brands him a traitor and threatens him with death should they ever meet again.   The three musketeers enter a remote prison and smuggle out an unnamed prisoner in an iron mask, taking him to the countryside, where Aramis reveals that he is [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|Philippe]], Louis's identical [[Twin|twin]] brother. Aramis reveals that the night Louis was born, his mother, [[Anne of Austria|Queen Anne]], gave birth to twins. [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], hoping to avoid dynastic warfare between his sons, sent Philippe away to live in the countryside with no knowledge of his true identity. On his deathbed, Louis XIII revealed Philippe's existence to Anne and Louis. Anne had been told by her priest that Philippe had died at birth and wished to restore Philippe's birthright. But Louis, now king and too superstitious to have his brother killed, had Philippe imprisoned in the iron mask to keep his identity secret, something Aramis reluctantly carried out. Aramis's plan is now to redeem himself and save France by replacing Louis with Philippe. The musketeers begin training Philippe to act and behave like Louis, while Athos develops fatherly feelings for him.  At a [[Masquerade ball|masquerade ball]], the musketeers lure Louis to his quarters and subdue him, dressing Philippe in his clothes while taking Louis to the dungeons. D'Artagnan uncovers the ruse, after Christine accuses Philippe with evidence of Louis's role in Raoul's death and is not punished. He forcibly escorts Philippe to the dungeons and they confront the musketeers before they can take Louis to the Bastille. They trade twins, but Philippe is captured before the musketeers escape. D'Artagnan is shocked to learn who Philippe is and begs Louis not to kill him, as does Anne. Louis refuses. Then Philippe pleads with Louis to kill him rather than put him back in the mask, which convinces Louis to send Philippe to the Bastille and have the mask placed on him again. He orders D'Artagnan to bring him the severed heads of Athos, Porthos and Aramis or Louis will have his head. Meanwhile, Christine commits suicide outside Louis' bedroom window out of grief.  D'Artagnan contacts his friends for help in rescuing Philippe from the Bastille. Louis, who suspected D'Artagnan would help his friends, ambushes them at the prison. Though he offers D'Artagnan clemency in exchange for surrender, D'Artagnan refuses, privately revealing to Philippe and his friends that Louis and Philippe are actually his sons from an affair with the Queen. He also reveals he never knew Philippe existed, and never felt pride as a father until now. They charge one final time at Louis and his men and are fired upon; their bravery compels the soldiers to close their eyes before firing and all miss. Louis attempts to stab Philippe but wounds D'Artagnan fatally and he dies in his friends' arms. Philippe attacks Louis but stops when D'Artagnan reminds him that Louis is his brother. Athos asks D'Artagnan's forgiveness realizing D'Artagnan's loyalty to Louis was out of fatherly devotion to his son, the same fatherly devotion Athos had to his son Raoul.   D'Artagnan's top lieutenant, Andre, angered by his mentor's death, swears his men to secrecy and orders them out of the prison, siding with Philippe. They switch the twins' places again and Philippe orders Louis locked away, naming Athos, Porthos and Aramis as his royal counsel. A small funeral is held for D'Artagnan and Philippe admits to Athos that he has come to love him like a father, which Athos reciprocates. Philippe later issues Louis a royal pardon and sends him to live peacefully in the countryside, and goes on to become one of France's greatest kings. The tombstone of D'Artagnan has an iron mask imprint chiseled upon it.

 In 1821, Don Diego de la Vega ([[Anthony Hopkins]]), a Californio nobleman, fights against the Spanish in the [[Mexican War of Independence]] as [[Zorro]], a mysterious swordsman who defends the Mexican peasants and commoners of [[Las Californias]]. Don Rafael Montero ([[Stuart Wilson (actor)|Stuart Wilson]]), the corrupt governor of the region, learns of De La Vega's ''alter ego'', and attempts to arrest him. De la Vega's wife Esperanza ([[Julieta Rosen]]) is killed during the scuffle. Montero imprisons de La Vega and takes his infant daughter, Elena, as his own before returning to [[Spain]].  Twenty years later, Montero returns to California as a civilian, alongside Elena ([[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]) who has grown into a beautiful woman and resembles her late mother. Montero's reappearance motivates de La Vega to escape from prison. He encounters a thief, Alejandro Murietta ([[Antonio Banderas]]) who, as a child, once did Zorro a favor. De la Vega decides that fate has brought them together, and agrees to make Alejandro his protégé, grooming him to be the new Zorro. Alejandro agrees to undergo de La Vega's training regimen in Zorro's lair underneath the ruins of his family estate in order to be able to take revenge on [[Harry Love (lawman)|Captain Harrison Love]] ([[Matt Letscher]]) Montero's right-hand man, who was responsible for killing Alejandro's brother, [[Joaquin Murietta|Joaquin]] (Victor Rivers).  While still being trained, Alejandro steals a black stallion resembling [[Tornado (horse)|Tornado]] from the local garrison. De La Vega scolds Alejandro, claiming that Zorro was a servant of the people, not a thief and adventurer. He challenges Alejandro to gain Montero's trust instead. Alejandro poses as a visiting nobleman named Don Alejandro del Castillo y García, with de la Vega as his servant, and attends a party at Montero's hacienda. At the party, he gains Elena's admiration and enough of Montero's trust to be invited to a secret meeting where several other noblemen are present. Montero hints at a plan to retake California for the Dons and proclaim it as an independent [[California Republic|republic]] by buying it from General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]], who needs money to fund his [[Mexican–American War|upcoming war with the United States]].  Montero takes Alejandro and the noblemen to a secret gold mine known as "[[El Dorado]]," where peasants and prisoners are used for slave labor. Montero plans to buy California from Santa Anna using gold mined from Santa Anna's own land. De la Vega uses this opportunity to become closer to Elena, though he identifies himself as "Bernardo" the servant, learning that Montero told Elena that her mother died in childbirth. While walking in a market, Elena meets the woman who was her nanny who tells Elena her parents' real identity. De la Vega sends Alejandro, dressed as Zorro, to steal Montero's map leading to the gold mine. Zorro duels Montero, Love, and their guards at the hacienda. When Zorro escapes, Elena attempts to retrieve Montero's map from the swordsman, but he seduces her, leading to a passionate kiss before he flees.  Terrified of Santa Anna's retribution if he discovers that he is being paid with his own gold, Montero, at Love's urging, decides to destroy the mine and kill the workers. De la Vega tells Alejandro to release the workers on his own so that de La Vega can reclaim Elena. Alejandro sets off, feeling betrayed by Diego's vendetta. De la Vega corners Montero at the hacienda and reveals his identity, but Montero captures him by threatening Elena. As he is taken away, de la Vega tells Elena the name of the flowers, ''romneya'', she recognized upon her arrival in California, convincing her that he is her father. She releases de la Vega from his cell and they proceed to the mine, where Alejandro and de la Vega respectively defeat and slay Love and Montero. Elena and Alejandro free the workers before the explosives go off, and then find the mortally wounded de la Vega. He makes peace with Alejandro and Elena and gives his blessings for Alejandro to marry his daughter before dying. Later on in the movie, Alejandro and Elena are married and have a son named Joaquin and Alejandro tells him the story of how his grandfather was the first Zorro and how he became and died a hero with Elena listening. Alejandro and Elena share a passionate kiss before Joaquin starts crying and Elena calms him down. The film ends with Alejandro walking down the corridor of his mansion before the door closes with Zorro pulling out his sword and making his mark with it being engulfed in flames.

Meet Joe Black
 Billionaire media mogul William Parrish is considering a merger between his company and another media giant, and is about to celebrate his 65th birthday with an elaborate party planned by his eldest daughter, Allison. He begins to hear mysterious voices, which he tries with increasing difficulty to ignore. His youngest daughter, Susan, a [[residency (medicine)|resident]] in [[internal medicine]], is in a relationship with one of Bills' board members, Drew. She is considering marriage, but Bill can tell she's not passionately in love. When she asks for the short version of his impassioned speech, he simply says, "Stay open. Who knows? Lightning could strike!"  Susan meets a vibrant young man at a coffee shop. She is instantly enamored but fails to even get his name. Minutes after their encounter (but unbeknownst to her), the man is struck by multiple cars in what appears to be a fatal motor vehicle accident. [[Death (personification)|Death]] arrives at Bills' home in the uninjured body of the young man, explaining that Bills' impassioned speech has piqued his interest. Given Bills' "competence, experience, and wisdom", Death says that for as long as Bill will be his guide on Earth, William will not have to die. Making up a name on the spot, Death is introduced to the family as "Joe Black".  Bills' best efforts to navigate the next few days, knowing them now to be his last, fail to keep events from going rapidly out of his control. Drew is secretly conspiring with a man bidding for Parrish Communications. He capitalizes on Bill's strange behavior and unexplained reliance on Joe to convince the board of directors to vote William out as Chairman, using information given to him inadvertently by Will's son-in-law, Quince, to push through approval for the merger which William had decided to oppose. Quince is devastated.  Susan is confused by the appearance of Joe, believing him to be the young man from the coffee shop, but eventually falls deeply in love with him. Joe is now under the influence of human desires and becomes attracted to her as well. After they make love, Joe asks Susan, "What do we do now?" She replies, "It'll come to us." William angrily confronts him about his relationship with his daughter, but Joe declares his intention to take Susan with him for his own.  As his last birthday arrives, William appeals to Joe to recognize the meaning of true love and all it encompasses, especially honesty and sacrifice. Joe comes to understand that he must set aside his own desire and allow Susan to live her life. He also helps William regain control of his company, exposing Drew's underhanded business dealings to the board by claiming to be an agent of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and threatening to put Drew in jail.  The party is in full swing, with jazz music, cake and speech by William.  He makes his peace with his daughters.   Susan tells Joe that she has loved him ever since that day in the coffee shop.    Joe realises that Susan loves the unknown man, not him, and the realization crushes him slightly.  Even mastering his emotions powerfully he balks at telling Susan who he really is, although she seems to intuit his true identity (it is slightly hinted that she experienced a similar state of feeling as the old lady from the hospital when Joe was trying to "take away her pain"). She mentions feeling like taking off before realizing something was off (that state of feeling Joe emanates).  Struggling to comprehend the enormity of the situation, Susan cannot label Joe as Death.  She says finally, "You're . . . you're Joe".  He promises her "you will always have what you found in the coffee shop."   On a hillock in the grounds above the party in full swing below, William expresses trepidation:  "Should I be afraid?"  Joe replies "Not a man like you", showing his respect for William.  Fireworks begin to pop in the distance; Susan watches Joe and her father walk out of view.  She is stunned as "Joe" reappears alone, bewildered, this time as the young man from the coffee shop. He is uninjured and cannot account for how he got there. Susan accepts that her father is gone, and  rekindles the romantic spark she had shared with the young man.   "What do we do now?" she asks.   "It'll come to us," Joe replies, as the two of them descend towards the twinkling lights of the party.  
Meet the Deedles
  Phil Deedle ([[Paul Walker]]) and Stew Deedle ([[Steve Van Wormer]]) are two [[fraternal twin]] brothers who are complete surf bums living in Hawaii off of their wealthy single father. After the two decide to skip school to go on a special surfing expedition with friends for their 18th birthday, the twins are expelled from their high school for truancy and knocking a truancy officer into the ocean. Their single father Elton Deedle ([[Eric Braeden]]) has become tired of their insolent, goofball, and lazy lifestyle and thus decides to ship them to a boot camp to straighten them out. The boys are horrified that they’re going to have to fly state-side in order for this to happen, as the camp is located in [[Yellowstone National Park]] in [[Wyoming]].  The boys arrive in Wyoming ill prepared for the far-cooler weather, disembarking from their plane dressed in shorts, flip-flops and hula shirts. They attract the attention of a small crowd when they summon a remote controlled crate containing a [[mini-bar]] that they use to create hula drinks. Afterwards they leave the terminal, noticing a scruffy and gruff looking [[mountain man]] whom they make fun of, to their shock the man reveals a sign with their last names written on it, indicating he’s their ride. Major Flowers ([[M. C. Gainey]]) is already disgusted with their behavior, on the drive back to Yellowstone from the airport, Flowers reveals that his once successful camp was shut down by the children’s parents and their lawyers but the camp wasn’t necessary anymore because he intended for the Deedles to undergo survival training. Flowers becomes distracted in describing his plan and fails to pay attention to the road, eventually driving over the edge of a hillside and crashing into a river after an incident that caused some circus animals to escape from a circus truck. Thinking he had killed the Deedles, he runs off thinking he’ll hide from the authorities.  The Deedles awaken from their crash and find some women’s clothing that had caught onto Flowers' truck before it crashed, since it was their only option for dry clothes they opted to wear them. After, they begin to hike towards the parks main entrance, they find some of their gear and decide to land-luge down a long hill with their mini-bar remotely in tow. They bypass a long line of traffic awaiting entry into Yellowstone, but unable to slow down or gain enough control of their boards, they crash into the park’s sign and are then collided into by the mini-bar—cracking their helmets off. When the Park Rangers arrived, the only identity the boys had on them were the names “Mel” written on Phil’s sweatshirt tag and “Mo” written on Stew’s. After the incident the boys are carted off to the Ranger medical center and nursed back to health and decide to assume the false identities as it appears to be a one-way ticket to success and favor of their father.  The boys find it difficult to live in their new identities, as the park rangers have already learned that the “real” Mel and Mo are foragers, thus the boys are forced to adapt to a diet that includes insects, worms, and various greens. Because of their dimwitted surfer nature, the boys do not click well with the commanding park ranger, Captain Pine ([[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]]), although Phil has the hots for his stepdaughter Lt. Jesse Ryan ([[A. J. Langer]]) whom the Captain is very protective of. This leads to a series of accidents all of which the Deedles are to blame for and land them in disfavor with Captain Pine.  Through their trials, the Deedles inadvertently discover that an ex-park ranger named Slater ([[Dennis Hopper]]) feels he’s been betrayed by the park, the Rangers and mainly Captain Pine and so he has created a secret bunker underground near [[Old Faithful]] and has devised a plan to divert Old Faithful’s waterflow into a new geyser he’s created on his own land which he christened “New Faithful”. Unable to win any support for investigation from their fellow rangers, the Deedles take matters into their own hands and attempt to thwart Slater’s plan.  However, the real Mel ([[Ana Gasteyer]]) and Mo ([[Megan Cavanaugh]]) arrive at the Ranger’s base at a very untimely moment to reveal that Phil and Stew are not who they say they are. Mel and Mo are heartbroken as well.  Though Pine was disgusted at this dishonesty, he takes back his plans to have them dealt with after they save him from a raging river and going over a waterfall.  Following Slater orchestrating Phil and Stew to cause an explosion near Old Faithful during a [[prairie dog]] infestation, Mel and Mo oversee their removal from Yellowstone. As the Deedles are walking down the highway attempting to hitch-hike, the big picture dawns on Phil and they devise a plan to get back into Yellowstone in order to stop Slater once-and-for-all. They rig a grappling hook into a grate in the roadway, and as an unsuspecting car passes it would catch the undercarriage and tow the Deedles (who are wearing parachutes), essentially a land version of parasailing. From a few hundred feet up in the air, they both notice a familiar stench and discover the person towing them is none other than Major Flowers—who becomes distracted by his stowaways and subsequently drives over a cliff (again) landing himself in a river.  The boys parachute to the entrance for Slater's [[tunnel network]] and are taken underground by Slater’s two henchmen Mr. Crabbe ([[Richard Lineback]]) and Mr. Nemo ([[Robert Englund]]). The Deedles also learn Slater was behind the prairie dog plague, and then the Deedles devise a plan, with a little help from a prairie dog named PD, who left the plague and joined the Deedles, to re-divert the water from New Faithful back to Old Faithful, and to escape by donning heat-resistance suits and escaping through the plumbing and through Old Faithful’s spout.  The plan succeeds. Slater is exposed and arrested with his henchmen, and the Deedles become heroes for saving Old Faithful. In a fortunate turn of events, the force of the explosion of water was so great it created a small lake which naturally created waves large enough to surf on, and the boys were able to create a park out of it. Earning the favor of their father for their success, from Captain Pine for their help in saving Yellowstone, and for Phil the love of Jesse.

Mercury Rising
  A hostage situation in [[South Dakota]]: [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Agent Art Jeffries ([[Bruce Willis]]), as the inside man, protects a teenage boy named James while trying to talk bank robber Edgar Halstrom ([[Richard Riehle]]) into surrendering. However, the [[FBI]] task force moves in, and in the ensuing firefight James and the robbers are killed. Jeffries confronts his superior, Hartley who gave the order, which leads to a further confrontation with the agency leadership and consequences for Jeffries.  A [[Code (cryptography)|cryptographic code]] called "Mercury" was created by the [[National Security Agency]] and is allegedly so complex that its creators believe no computer on Earth can decipher it. Originally it was created during the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] as a test to keep the United States' highest priority secrets under wraps. One day, the NSA receives a message from a nine-year-old [[autistic savant]] with [[child prodigy|prodigious]] [[mental calculator|math abilities]] named Simon Lynch ([[Miko Hughes]]), who calls a telephone number written in the code which was secretly published in a puzzle magazine by two of the creators, Dean Crandell ([[Robert Stanton (actor)|Robert Stanton]]) and Leo Pedranski ([[Bodhi Elfman]]), to see if anyone could break it. Crandell and Pedranski's division chief, Lt. Colonel Nicholas Kudrow ([[Alec Baldwin]]) sees the boy's ability to decipher the code as a grave liability.  He dispatches assassin Peter Burrell ([[Lindsey Ginter|Lindsey Lee Ginter]]) to murder the boy and his parents, Martin ([[John Carroll Lynch]]) and Jenny (Kelley Hazen).  After shooting Martin and Jenny, Burrell searches the house, fails to find Simon, and leaves at the sound of approaching sirens (Martin was able to call 911 before dying). Jeffries, who has been demoted following a diagnosis of delusional paranoia, is sent to investigate what is initially thought to be a murder-suicide. While investigating the scene, Jeffries finds Simon hiding in a cache of his bedroom closet and takes the boy under his wing. Jeffries begins to realize the difficulty of protecting, let alone questioning, Simon because of his impaired social abilities as a result of his [[autism]], but the Chicago Police Department agree to assign a protection detail to Simon. Burrell tries to kill Simon again at the hospital, but Jeffries stops him. He is then forced to terminate an assassin named Shayes ([[Peter Stormare]]) on the [[Chicago 'L']] train. The situation is further complicated by the fact that nobody at the FBI believes Simon is in any danger, and Jeffries is soon framed by the NSA as a kidnapper, with only his best friend and fellow agent Tommy Jordan ([[Chi McBride]]) aware that he did not commit the crime, since Jordan had been in contact with Jeffries when the incident began. Jeffries borrows Jordan's car (which Jordan later reports stolen to conceal his involvement) and takes Simon back to his house. Simon again calls the telephone number written in the code and talks to Crandell and Pedranski. When Jeffries confronts them, a conflicted Crandell arranges a meeting via encoded e-mail at the [[Wrigley Building]]. The next morning, Jeffries meets a woman named Stacey Siebring ([[Kim Dickens]]) in a coffee shop and asks her to watch Simon for him.  Jeffries meets Crandell and the two talk and stroll on a busy sidewalk. Crandell tells Jeffries about "Mercury" and Kudrow, then Burrell shoots him from behind and gets away safely. Jeffries returns to the coffee shop, but Simon and Stacey are gone. He goes outside and spots them coming across the street. Stacey says she and Simon have become friends and Simon agrees. Jeffries and Simon then abruptly leave Stacey. Later in the middle of the night, Jeffries and Simon go to Stacey's house, asking for a place to stay. Stacey reluctantly agrees and tells Jeffries that she was going on a business trip to [[Des Moines]] to make the rent the next morning.  Meanwhile, Pedranski, having learned Crandell's fate, picks up where his friend left off by writing a pair of letters via typewriter: one to Jeffries and the other to the [[United_States_congressional_hearing#Oversight_hearings|Senate Oversight Committee]], revealing Kudrow's unlawful actions. Soon after, Pendranski is murdered by Burrell, who also snatches the letters. However, the assassin neglects to grab the carbon copies Pedranski tossed, which his girlfriend, NSA analyst Emily Lang ([[Carrie Preston]]), takes to the FBI. Jordan discreetly arranges for her to meet with Jeffries to show them both the [[carbon paper]] used to type the letter, which, being covered in Pedranski's fingerprints, is crucial evidence in its own right. After the meeting with Emily, Jeffries tells Stacey to call anyone for an emergency except the police, who were called off at the last minute, and gives her Jordan's number in case of an emergency. While Jeffries introduces himself to Kudrow at his birthday party and demands that Kudrow leave Simon alone, Jordan, under Jeffries' suggestion, arranges for Simon to go into Witness Protection. After the meeting, Jeffries calls Jordan, who explains that the Witness Protection meeting is going to happen, though they are unaware that their [[Telephone tapping|conversation is being monitored]] by Kudrow. When Jeffries returns and finds Stacey and Simon gone, he learns from Jordan that they are not in any danger and will meet them there, just as Jordan is given an order to head to the FBI director's office.  Kudrow tries to have FBI SAC (Special Agent in Charge) Joe Lomax ([[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]]) help turn the tables on Jeffries by using his authority and the fact that Jordan arranged the Witness Protection under false pretenses. He plans to have the NSA take over the protection for the meeting location. After Kudrow leaves, Jordan shows the evidence to Lomax and despite his initial doubts, Jordan confirms that the fingerprint markings on it were Pedranski's, now fully validating the evidence against Kudrow. Jeffries, with Jordan and a small FBI task force's help, sets a trap at the meeting spot. During the battle, Jordan protects Stacey, and the FBI team takes on Burrell, who is killed, trying to escape, when the windows blow out slashing his face open. Jeffries and Kudrow fight on the roof during which Simon walks to the edge of the roof and grabs Kudrow's gun, giving it to Jeffries and allowing him to take control as Jordan and the team come in. In a last-ditch effort to get his victim back, Kudrow grabs Simon, is shot at point blank range by Jeffries, and subsequently falls to his death over the edge of the building.  Jeffries later visits Simon (now living with foster parents) at his school. He embraces the FBI agent as a welcome friend, having finally accepted him as a person he trusts.  
Merlin (miniseries)
  Merlin, now an elderly man telling his life story, explains how Britain was faced with rulers and [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|invasion]] that are increasingly destructive to its own people. [[Queen Mab]] seeks to reclaim her power by drawing people back to [[Paganism|the "Old Ways]]". To do so, she creates a wizard named Merlin, whom she intends to champion her crusade. After Merlin's mother dies giving birth to him, his guardian Ambrosia tells Mab she is too cruel and cold to raise Merlin, and Mab agrees that Ambrosia will bring him up until Merlin's powers emerge, when Mab will send for him.  Years later, a teenage Merlin recounts to Ambrosia how he has rescued a nobleman's daughter, Nimue, in the forests near their home by magically growing a small branch. Ambrosia tells him of his past and he is sent to Mab to begin his training with Frik, Mab's gnome servant; however, Merlin has little interest in helping Mab's crusade to restore the Old Ways, angering her. Merlin finds out from the [[Lady of the Lake]] that her sister Mab let his birth mother die and that Ambrosia is ill. Mab reaches Ambrosia's home before Merlin, but when Ambrosia refuses to convince Merlin to return to Mab, Mab lashes out fatally injuring Ambrosia. Ambrosia tells Merlin before she dies that he must follow his heart. Merlin tries to attack Mab but can't defeat her; she dismisses the deaths of his mother and Ambrosia as "casualties of war" and vows that Merlin will help her in her quest for power. Merlin makes a blood-oath never to use magic.  Many years pass. Merlin is brought before the tyrant King [[Vortigern]] who is having problems constructing his castle, which keeps collapsing. Merlin calls the king stupid for believing what he was told by a soothsayer. Merlin tells the king his vision: a red dragon representing [[Uther Pendragon]], defeats the white dragon that represents Vortigern. Mab tells the king that he can vanquish Uther by sacrificing Nimue in the hope that Merlin will break his vow not to use magic. Merlin uses magic to save Nimue from the fire of the dragon and Nimue is sent to [[Avalon]] to recover from her burns. Merlin asks the Lady of the Lake for help, and she gives him the magical sword [[Excalibur]].  Merlin warns Uther of Vortigern's intention to attack him under the cover of winter; Uther heeds Merlin's warning and confronts the king on a frozen river. In the ensuing battle, Merlin duels Vortigern with Excalibur, using the sword's magic to open up the ice beneath Vortigern's feet, who plunges into the river and drowns. Merlin gives Uther Excalibur.  Uther becomes obsessed with [[Igraine]], the wife of [[Gorlois]], Lord of Cornwall. Merlin tricks Uther out of the sword and plunges it into the Rock of Ages, who promises to keep it until a good man can withdraw it. Uther's mind is plagued by madness and lust, and Britain slides back into civil war. Merlin strikes a deal with Uther to bed Igraine in exchange for guardianship of the son born from the union, and for Gorlois and his men to be spared. Merlin transforms Uther's appearance into that of Gorlois. Uther enters the castle and has sex with Igraine. Igraine's disfigured daughter, [[Morgan le Fay]], is the only one who sees through Uther's disguise. Uther betrays Merlin and has Cornwall and his men slaughtered. While Igraine is in labor, at Mab's behest, Frik convinces Morgan to place a black stone beneath the baby's sheets in his crib. Igraine gives birth to [[King Arthur]] but at the cost of her own life. Mab then confronts Merlin, proclaiming Arthur to be damned, but Merlin vows to raise him in the ways of good and hopes Arthur will help bring her down.   Arthur, who is unaware of his heritage, is tutored by Merlin. Meanwhile, Uther commits suicide, which leaves the kingdom in turmoil over who will be the new king. Merlin informs Arthur of his rightful place as the only son of Uther and true heir to the throne. Mab attempts to kill Arthur by unleashing a pack of [[griffin]]s; Merlin foils the attack by directing a swarm of bees to drive the monsters off. With the throne vacant, the noblemen in the kingdom try to take Excalibur from the Rock of Ages, but none can. The Rock allows Arthur to pull out Excalibur.   Merlin presents Arthur to the gathered nobility; while most accept his claim, a handful, led by [[King Lot|Lord Lot]] initially refuse to accept Arthur as King. However, Arthur is able to convince Lot and his allies of his rightful claim to the throne. Merlin leaves, thinking the kingdom is finally at peace, but Mab instructs Frik to seek out Arthur's half-sister Morgan ([[Helena Bonham Carter]]), and poison her mind by making her beautiful, and has her seduce Arthur, who is unaware of their relationship. Merlin races back to Camelot to confront Arthur. Merlin tells Arthur that Morgan will give birth [[Mordred]] ([[Jason Done]]), whom Mab raises to become Arthur's downfalls. Mordred grows at an abnormally fast rate. Arthur starts construction of his castle of Camelot and marries [[Guinevere]].  Arthur decides to take his knights on a quest for the [[Holy Grail]], so he holds a tournament to crown a champion who will be given the duty of defending and completing Camelot in his absence. The Lady of the Lake vows to guide Merlin by boat to a "good man" worthy of being Camelot's guardian.  Merlin finds a boy, [[Galahad]], by the riverbank in front of the estate of his parents, [[Lancelot]], a skilled rider and swordsman, and [[Elaine of Astolat]], Lancelot's wife. Merlin brings Lancelot back to Camelot, where he then wins the tournament. In Arthur's absence, Guinevere and Lancelot embark on a love affair. Mab makes sure Elaine can see his betrayal, and she is found dead at the shores of Camelot not long after. Merlin accuses Lancelot of killing her through and he flees Camelot in his guilt and shame. Arthur and his knights return, their quest a failure.  Mordred makes his presence as Arthur's son and heir known and reveals Guinevere's betrayal to all. Outmaneuvered by Mordred, Arthur is forced to condemn her to be burned at the stake for treason. Midway through the execution, Arthur changes his mind and begs Merlin to save her, so Merlin makes it rain, which saves Guinevere long enough for Lancelot to fight his way into Camelot and ride off with her.  Mordred confronts Arthur who denounces and banishes him. Mordred raises an army among those dissatisfied with Arthur and Merlin. Meanwhile, Frik and Morgan have fallen in love after Mab's magic makes them both beautiful. When Morgan refuses to allow Mab to further use Mordred for her own ends, Mab kills her with Frik watching. Frik holds the dying Morgan and they revert to their true ugly forms, but they both call each other beautiful anyway, and she dies in his arms. When Frik vows revenge on Mab, she takes his powers away, and he later joins Arthur's army.  Mab lures Nimue into a wilderness and removes the scars from her past injury, explaining she wishes to keep Merlin out of the way, so he cannot intervene in the battle to come. Wanting to be with him, Nimue agrees and sends for Merlin. He comes but senses a trap when he realizes that the idyllic paradise they are in is Mab's creation. However, Nimue convinces him to stay. Meanwhile, the armies of Mordred and Arthur prepare themselves for the [[Battle of Camlann]]. Many on both sides are slain, and Arthur defeats Mordred. Mordred deals Arthur a fatal blow before Arthur kills him.  Knowing his protégé is dying, Merlin leaves Nimue to go to Arthur; however once he leaves, the magic of Mab's creation seals itself behind him, parting Merlin from Nimue. At the battlefield, both Mab and Merlin witness the deaths of their protégés. Mab's magic is unable to save Mordred while Arthur lives long enough to tell Merlin to return Excalibur to the place it was found so no one else may wield its power. Arthur dies as Merlin gives back the sword to the Lady of the Lake. She is slowly dying as Old Ways are being rejected and forgotten. Merlin accuses her of lying to him about the guardian of Camelot, but she explains that "it was the boy, Galahad" who was the true guardian and could have averted all this, though she assures Merlin that Arthur's death is not his fault. Merlin encounters Frik among the survivors of Arthur's army, who warns him that although Mab is greatly weakened, she is still dangerous.  Merlin confronts Mab at Camelot but the ensuing magical duel ends in stalemate. Mab sneers that she is invulnerable to conventional means of destruction, but Merlin responds that everyone ignoring her will led to her defeat. Mab slowly fades into nothing as Merlin, Frik and the entire court of Camelot turn their backs on her and walk away.  Merlin is again shown back in the "present" telling his story. Frik appears and tells Merlin that Merlin's version is not what Frik remembers. Merlin replies that people will believe his version. After Merlin finds his aged magic horse, Frik reveals it will lead him to Nimue. When Merlin asks how, Frik says that some time after Mab had disappeared, the spells she had cast has lost their effectiveness, and Nimue was set free. Merlin finds Nimue at Ambrosia's old forest home. Both lovers, now old, are transformed to younger days by Merlin's last act of magic to live out their lives together.  
Men in White (1998 film)
 Roy DuBro ([[Karim Prince]]) and Ed Klingbottom ([[Thomas F. Wilson]]) are garbage men who are constantly undermined by their corrupt boss Junior Assistant Dispatcher Trainee Stanley Snyder ([[M. Emmet Walsh]]).  One day, the earth is secretly invaded by an army of flying saucers, commanded by a [[Darth Vader]]-esque alien called Glaxxon ([[Dave Fennoy]]). A saucer abducts the two men and the aliens on board attempt to vivisect them. Fortunately, they awaken just in time and escape back to earth with an alien fire extinguisher. When they arrive late for work and try to tell Stanley about the aliens, he doesn't believe them, having heard every alien story ever from fellow worker Old Bob ([[Don Stroud]]).  President Smith ([[Barry Bostwick]]) and his significantly more competent press secretary ([[Donna D'Errico]]) receive news about the invasion from General Vice ([[George Kennedy]]) and the President tells his advisor, Dr. Strangemeister ([[Wigald Boning]]), to find two people with alien experience and make them into secret agents. Unbeknownst to anyone, Strangemeister is secretly in league with Glaxon, who is infuriated by Ed and Roy's interference. Strangemeister hires the two of them, believing that they are destined to fail and transforms them into 'The Men in White'.  The aliens start abducting people all over the world. Roy suggests the two of them use a cow as bait. The plan works and they successfully capture an alien spaceship. Unfortunately, they discover [[Neuralyzer | a device that makes them forget the last several seconds]], and the two of them get stuck in a continuous loop for several hours until its batteries run down.  After a brief musical number, Strangemeister convinces the President to make a broadcast, assuring the remaining humans that they are safe. Meanwhile, the device runs out of battery power and the two men are freed from the loop. The two discover a weapon on the ship called the "Illudium PU-36 Explosive Space Modulator" and take it. They also fuel their garbage truck with Dylythium Blend from the spaceship's engine, enabling it to fly.  Roy uses the Modulator to destroy the invading saucers. Strangemeister combats this by telling the president that they intend to use the Modulator to take over the world. Glaxon sends four bounty-hunters to destroy the two heroes and at the same time, the president sends in the Special Forces (including a cowboy, an Indian, a fencer and a group of girl scouts) to do the same. Ed and Roy are chased into a factory and manage to elude both forces, which in turn start attacking each other. In the confusion, the Modulator overloads and destroys the bounty-hunters, with all the humans escaping just in time.  Glaxon, on Strangemeister’s suggestion, uses the mother ship’s main weapon to destroy every garbage truck on the planet. Ed and Roy escape by flying into outer space. They overcome a series of obstacles and make their way towards the mother ship. The president addresses the press and is then taken to the war-room, in an underground bunker. The generals and Strangemeister join them soon after. Ed and Roy board the mother ship and crawl through the air ducts to the computer room.  While Ed hacks into the computer and installs a self-destruct virus, Roy wrestles with Glaxon and ultimately defeats him by launching him into space. With the virus uploaded, all the on-board humans and aliens make their way to the escape-pods a good ten seconds before the ship explodes. Ed and Roy land in a swimming-pool. Unable to comprehend being defeated by garbage men, Strangemeister exposes his true intentions to the President and reveals that he was actually a tiny man ([[Ben Stein]]) inside a robotic humanoid suit who was shrunken in a sauna by an alien.  To reward them for their success, the President promotes the two heroes to 'Senior Assistant Dispatcher Trainees' and demotes Stanley who is forced to pick up the trash for everyone on the planet (as all the other garbage trucks were destroyed). The two reconcile with Bessie the cow and the film ends.

The Mighty
 Kevin "Freak" Dillon ([[Kieran Culkin]]) is a 13-year-old boy who has [[Morquio syndrome|Mucopolysaccharidosis IV]] (or Morquio syndrome) and lives with his mother Gwen Dillon ([[Sharon Stone]]). He is extremely intelligent and prone to flights of fancy, but due to his disability walks with leg braces and crutches. Maxwell "Max" Kane ([[Elden Henson]]) is a 15-year-old oversized, yet good-natured, teenage boy who suffers from [[dyslexia]] and lives with his maternal grandparents Susan "Gram" ([[Gena Rowlands]]) and Elton "Grim" Pinneman ([[Harry Dean Stanton]]). He has flunked the seventh grade twice and is tormented by Tony "Blade" Fowler (Joseph Perrino), a teenage juvenile delinquent from the same school as Freak and Max, who is also the leader of the "Doghouse Boys", a teenage bully gang. When Kevin is assigned as Max's reading tutor, they form a bond of friendship over the similar circumstances they share, such as both being outcasts and their fathers abandoning them.  Freak and Max go to a local festival to watch a firework show and get attacked by Blade and his gang. The two escape into a nearby lake with Freak riding on Max's shoulders. Freak later witnesses the "Doghouse Boys" putting someone's purse in a sewer. The two retrieve the purse, but are once again confronted by Blade and his gang. They attempt to attack Freak, but Max stops them by picking up a manhole cover and throwing it at the gang, who run away, fearing for their lives. Both Max and Freak found out the purse belongs to a woman named Loretta Lee ([[Gillian Anderson]]). Freak and Max return the purse to Loretta and find out that she is married to Iggy Lee ([[Meat Loaf]]), a former gang leader.  Loretta recognizes Max from his childhood; she and Iggy were old friends of Max's father, Kenny "Killer" Kane, who is currently serving a prison sentence for the murder of Max's mother. Afterward, the two boys help each other out with Freak acting as Max's brain, and Max acting as Freak's legs by carrying him around everywhere on his shoulders. This allows Freak to partake in activities he couldn't before, such as a basketball game.  Freak, in an attempt to entertain his friends by playing with his food, chokes on it and collapses. He is rushed to the hospital, where Gwen is informed that Freak has only a year left to live, due to his deteriorating health accelerated by the blockage of his airways.  One day, Freak shows Max a research center where he was to be rehabilitated. It appears that he knew about his condition, as he stated that he'd be the first one to be retrofitted with a new body.  On Christmas Eve, Max is kidnapped by Kenny, who has been released from prison on parole. Max is taken to Iggy and Loretta's apartment and tied up. Loretta discreetly attempts to help Max escape, which leads to Kenny attempting to strangle her. Max uncovers a repressed memory of Kenny killing his mother; he breaks free of his bounds and attacks his father.  Freak tracks Max and Kenny to Iggy and Loretta's apartment and breaks in, armed with a squirt gun he claims is loaded with sulfuric acid, which he sprays in Kenny's eyes. Just as Kenny regains himself and attempts to attack Freak, Max tackles him through the wall, where the police are waiting. Kenny attempts to run away before getting tackled down by an officer and is taken back to prison to serve for life without the possibility of early parole, and Freak tells Max the squirt gun was loaded with harmless chemicals, such as soap and chili powder.  Freak and Max, along with Gwen, Grim and Gram, have Christmas dinner together. Exchanging gifts, Freak gives Max a blank book and tells him to write in it. That night, Freak dies in his sleep from heart problems. Max is woken to Gram breaking the news to him, and he gives chase to the ambulance on foot. Max recalls the research facility Freak had mentioned working on a cure. He rushes there, only to discover Freak had lied; it was actually a commercial laundromat. Max collapses, screaming in despair among the laundry workers.  For the next several weeks, Max continues going to school, but refuses to leave his room otherwise. He misses Freak's funeral and Gwen moving away. He later runs into Loretta at a bus stop, wearing a neck brace from Kenny's attempted strangulation. She tells him that doing "nothing's a drag". He takes this advice to heart, even working up the courage to answer a question from a teacher during a lecture.  Inspired by their bond, Max remembers Freak and all the adventures they had and he decides to write it all in the empty book Freak had given him. Max eventually gets writer's block on the last page so he puts an illustration of King Arthur's grave, which reads, "Here Lies King Arthur, Once and Future King", to symbolize his belief that he will see Freak again. Max takes Freak's ornithopter and winds it up, making it fly. A narration by Max is heard as the ornithopter flies off:

Twelve years later, Jill has raised Joe, now grown to a height of  and weighing . As a result, other gorillas will not accept him and they are both now living in relative peace until a wildlife refuge director, Gregg O'Hara, convinces Jill they would be safer from poachers if they relocated to the United States.  The trio goes to [[Los Angeles]], and win the hearts of the refuge staff at the [[conservancy]], who put Jill in charge of Joe. Jill is approached by Strasser, who is now running a fraudulent animal preserve in [[Botswana]], while actually selling animal organs on the black market. After seeing a news report about Joe, he is eager for revenge. At first Jill does not recognize Strasser, since Strasser's right hand is concealed in his coat pocket. He attempts to convince Jill that Joe would be better off in his wildlife refuge back in Africa. During a gala, Strasser's henchman, Garth, uses a poacher's noisemaker to scare Joe into a frenzy. Joe trashes the gala, with the intention of attacking Strasser, but is captured, and imprisoned in a concrete bunker.   When Jill discovers that Joe may be euthanized, she accepts Strasser's offer. She and the refuge staff smuggle Joe out in a truck. Before their departure, Gregg has fallen in love with Jill and kisses her goodbye. On the way to the airport, Jill notices the half-glove covering Strasser's missing fingers and recognizes him. She fights Strasser and Garth, then jumps from the truck onto [[Hollywood Boulevard]], leading to several automobile accidents. Joe sees her and tilts the truck over onto its side and flees.  Gregg discovers that Strasser is a poacher and goes after Jill and Joe. He finds Jill, who reveals to Gregg that Strasser killed her mother and now plans to kill Joe. They track Joe to a carnival where he is playfully wreaking havoc. Strasser arrives as well and attempts to shoot Jill, but Garth, appalled at Strasser's ruthlessness, turns against him and saves Jill, causing Strasser to misfire at a spotlight, starting a fire and causing the Ferris wheel to break down. After knocking Garth unconscious, Strasser attempts to kill Jill in person, but Joe sneaks up behind them and throws Strasser onto a power line over a transformer. Short two fingers on the hand holding the wire, Strasser loses his grip and falls onto the transformer, where he is electrocuted to death.  Later, at the [[Santa Monica Pier]], Joe attempts to save a child from atop the burning wheel, but the fire burns it down and Joe and the child fall to the ground, where Joe jumps off of the burning wheel, protecting the boy and knocking himself unconscious. Joe survives the fall and awakens and Jill mentions that they need to raise money to open a preserve for him. The young boy named Jason donates some change to Jill after hearing this, prompting the rest of the crowd to contribute.  Joe is returned to Uganda where Jill and Gregg open the "Joe Young Preserve".

The Minion
 The film's plot revolves around the coming of the [[End time|Apocalypse]], heralded by the imminent liberation of the [[Antichrist]] from the depths of [[Hell]] through a certain gateway at the close of one full [[millennium]]. This gate can only be opened by a special key, which has been kept guarded by the order of the [[Templar]]s (who in this version existed since the last days of [[Jesus]]). The key in turn is sought out by the servant of the Antichrist, simply known as ''the Minion'', a [[demonic]] spirit that transfers itself into the next available host body when his previous one is killed off. His first attempt to gain the key at the close of the year 999 is foiled; the sole surviving Templar of the company charged with hiding the key eventually takes off with a ship to the west, to what was at that time known as the "end of the world", to keep it from the Minion's grasp.  A thousand years later, near [[Christmas]] of 1999, two city engineer workers accidentally find a hidden Templar burial chamber beneath [[New York City]]. A [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] archeologist, Karen Goodleaf, is tasked with the examination of the chamber and its contents, but then the Minion attacks. Before he can claim the key, however, he is hindered by a man in [[Soutane|priest garb]], who kills the Minion's host body with a blow from a spiked gauntlet to a certain part of the neck and then takes the key for himself. Startled and confused, Karen chases after the man, who gradually introduces himself as "Lukas". Lukas Sadorov is a Templar and a former [[Speznas]] who deserted the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army|army]] following a massacre on civilians in [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], sent by the head of his order to recover the key. After a lot of insistence, Karen tags along with Lukas and eventually gains his trust, and after having seen the Minion in action, she decides to help by proposing to hide the key in a [[nuclear waste]] depository built on the grounds of her childhood [[Indian reservation|reservation]] home, whose lingering radioactivity would theoretically prevent the Minion's host bodies from claiming it. She enlists the help of her grandfather, Michael Bear, a Mohawk shaman who works as a foreman at the depository plant, in order to gain access to the facility.  However, the Minion repeatedly takes over people who unwittingly come into contact with his previous, if disabled host bodies, enabling him to continue his relentless pursuit. He finally takes possession of Karen's former archeology tutor, Professor Schulman, who is providing assistance to the [[NYPD]] during the investigation of the apparent serial murder case, and tricks the police into opening a manhunt on Lukas. After killing Karen's grandfather and donning his [[radiation suit]] as a disguise, he tricks Lukas into giving him the key and escapes with it to [[Jerusalem]], the location of the Templar's sanctuary and the gate to Hell hidden within its crypts.  The Minion arrives at the Templars' headquarters just before Lukas and Karen do, taking the Templars by surprise and killing most of them. Bernhard, one of the Templar Knights, manages to kill the Minion, but in his eagerness to prove himself better than Lukas, he accidentally allows the Minion to take possession of him and thus insert the key into the gate. Lukas and Karen arrive shortly after, and while Karen tries to remove the key from the lock, Lukas battles the possessed Bernhard and kills him. Together, he and Karen, although tempted by the Antichrist himself, manage to prevent the gate's unlocking just before the final seal on the door is burst. With the Templars decimated, Lukas decides to rebuild the order, and Karen spontaneously declares to join him in his efforts, marking the dawn of a new generation of Templars to guard the gate and the key.

Les Misérables (1998 film)
 [[Jean Valjean]], a man arrested for stealing bread nineteen years earlier, is released on account of Mrs. Herberst, Valjeans wife. When no one is willing to allow a convict to stay the night, [[Bishop Myriel]] kindly welcomes him into his home. Valjean explains to Myriel that sleeping in a real bed will make him a new man. In the night, Valjean, interrupted by Myriel while stealing his silverware, strikes him and flees. When the police arrest Valjean for stealing and drag him back to Myriel, Myriel tells them that the silverware was a gift and scolds Valjean for forgetting to take his candlesticks as well. Myriel then reminds Valjean that he is to become a new man.  Nine years later, Valjean is now a wealthy industrialist and a mayor. [[Fantine]], a single mother working at one of Valjean's factories, is fired when her manager learns she has had a daughter out of wedlock. However, Valjean is preoccupied with the arrival of Inspector [[Javert]], who previously served as a guard at the prison in which Valjean was held. Fantine, in desperate need of money to pay the extortionate demands of Mr. and Mrs. [[Thénardiers|Thénardier]] for looking after her daughter [[Cosette]], turns to prostitution. Javert starts to suspect that the Mayor and Valjean are the same person. Fantine is attacked by some customers, and when she retaliates, Javert beats and arrests her, planning on sending her to prison. Citing his authority to do so as mayor, Valjean insists on her release and she is let go.  Valjean nurses Fantine back to health, and promises her that she will have her daughter back. However, the Thénardiers continue to extort more money from Valjean and Fantine on the pretence of Fantine's daughter being ill. Later, Valjean receives word that [[Champmathieu|another man]] is mistaken as being him and is about to be arrested. Valjean arrives at court where the man is being tried and reveals his identity that he is the real Valjean. Valjean then returns home and finds Fantine at death's door. Before she dies, Valjean promises Fantine that he will raise her daughter as his own. Javert arrives at Valjean's home to arrest both him and Fantine, but Fantine dies when Javert tells her she will be sent to  prison. Angry and grieving, Valjean fights Javert and knocks him out, then flees the town. Valjean eventually finds and rescues Cosette from the Thénardiers, the corrupt innkeepers who were supposed to care for her, but are actually forcing her to be their servant. They care little for the girl, seeing her merely as a way to bring in money (going so far as to offer up Cosette as a child prostitute to the as-of-yet unrevealed Valjean). Both Valjean and Cosette finally make it to Paris where they start a new life together as father and daughter, cloistered within a religious convent.  Ten years later, they leave the convent, and Cosette, now nineteen years old, falls deeply in love with a revolutionist, [[Marius Pontmercy|Marius]]. Meanwhile, Javert is now undercover as an insurrectionist, trying to undermine the organization to which Marius belongs. During an attempt to finally arrest Valjean, Javert is captured by Marius and is brought to the barricades as a prisoner to be executed. Valjean journeys to the barricades himself when he learns how much Cosette and Marius love each other, intending to persuade Marius to return to Cosette. When the soldiers shoot and kill [[Gavroche]], a young boy allied with the revolutionists, Valjean uses his influence with Marius to have Javert turned over to him, so that he himself can execute him. Valjean takes Javert to a back alley, but instead of killing him, sets him free. Marius gets shot and Valjean takes him down a sewer to bring him to safety. Javert catches them, but agrees to spare Marius. Valjean takes Marius back to his home, also saying goodbye to Cosette. When Valjean returns to Javert, Javert tells him that he is now unable to reconcile Valjean's criminal past with his current lawful existence and the great kindness, generosity, and goodness that Valjean has shown. Stating, "It's a pity the rules don't allow me to be merciful," Javert finally sets Valjean free, shackles himself, adding "I've tried to live my life without breaking a single rule," and throws himself into the [[Seine]] thus taking his own life. Valjean walks down the empty street, finally a free man, with a smile on his face.

Modern Vampires
 Dallas ([[Casper Van Dien]]) is not a very discriminating vampire. Years ago, in an effort to save the life of Hans, the crippled son of famed Viennese vampire hunter Doctor Frederick Van Helsing, he turned him into a vampire, without permission from The Count ([[Robert Pastorelli]]). It's later revealed that he turned young and waifish Nico ([[Natasha Gregson Wagner]]), who has since been on a killing spree across Los Angeles earning her the nickname "Hollywood Slasher", which infuriates The Count, who orders her immediate death. Even with both Van Helsing and The Count on his tail and after 20 years in exile, Dallas can't resist returning to L.A. to pay a visit to his dearest friends — beautiful Ulrike ([[Kim Cattrall]]), urbane Vincent ([[Udo Kier]]), artist Richard ([[Craig Ferguson]]) and Richard's ever-pregnant wife Panthia ([[Natasha Andrejchenko]]). To celebrate Dallas' return, the five of them decide to spend the night clubbing in one of The Count's many vampire bars. Unfortunately, The Count is also there. When he sees Dallas is back in town, he gives him three days to leave or else.  Dr. Van Helsing ([[Rod Steiger]]), leader of Van Helsing's Institute of Vienna, also has his eye on the band of merrymaking vampires. "It's an infestation" he concludes, and realizes that he can't handle the extermination alone. So, he puts an ad in the newspaper looking for a "strong and brave young man who's not afraid to get his hands dirty in a cause that is holy." What he gets is [[Crips]] member Time Bomb ([[Gabriel Casseus]]), who doesn't believe in vampires but is willing to put a stake through anyone's heart for cold hard cash. The pair succeed in killing Vincent.  After killing Vincent, Van Helsing tells Time Bomb that 20 years ago his son Hans became good friends with Dallas who promised to save his life from a fatal genetic disorder by turning him into a vampire. He eventually discovered this on his own by finding out his wife was secretly visiting Hans late night at a family mausoleum. He then killed Hans with a stake through the heart, and mentions that after killing Hans, his wife committed suicide out of grief. Van Helsing makes it abundantly clear that he will destroy Dallas.  Dallas is feeling protective (and a little curious) about his protegee Nico, so he drives around Hollywood Boulevard that night until he spots her. After sharing a bit of each other's blood, Dallas reveals who he is and explains that the vampire community is out to get her. They're afraid that Nico will get herself arrested and then the whole world will know that vampires exist. Dallas forces her to move from the junked oil tanker in which she sleeps and to come live with Richard and Panthia who clean her up and take her shopping for some new clothes. Panthia develops a mother-like complex towards Nico and starts treating her like a daughter.  When they pick another victim at a late night coffee shop, Nico makes a human friend named Rachel ([[Natasha Lyonne]]). But, when they return to Richard and Panthia's house, they find Ulrike sitting on her car hood, crying. She has discovered Vincent's decaptiated body. Knowing that this was Van Helsing's handywork, Dallas theorizes that he's closing in on them. Dallas then decides to take Nico to see her mother's house since Nico doesn't remember much about her past during her human life. This turns out to be a bad idea, as Nico has him kill her verbally and sexually abusive stepfather as payback for all that "sex shit he did to her when she was little". Nico exchanges heated words with her neglectful mother, who she claims never loved her. As they leave the trailer park, they are attacked by four of The Count's henchmen. Dallas and Nico manage to shoot three of them and set fire to the fourth.  Dallas then tells his side of the story to Nico - Originally Dallas was ordered to kill Van Hellsing, but he ended up befriending Hans and decided not to. After saving Hans from the genetic disorder, he hoped that his father's attitude would change towards the vampire community, but it didn't. Van Helsing became vengeful towards Dallas and killed Hans without mercy. The Count then banished Dallas as punishment for not carrying out his order to kill him.  The next night, while Richard, Panthia, and Ulrike are sitting around the living room and listening to music, Nico gets a call from her new friend Rachel and Invites Nico out to a small party with some delinquent teenagers, and Nico is eager to go. Meanwhile, Dallas pays a visit to The Count and begs to be allowed to train Nico. The Count will have none of it and advises Dallas to deliver Nico to him or he and everyone he cares about "will die screaming".  Having come to the conclusion that even two vampire hunters will not be enough against the vampire infestation, Van Helsing and Time Bomb bring in three more [[Crips]] members - Soda Pop ([[Victor Togunde]]), L'il Monster ([[Cedrick Terrell]]), and Trigger ([[Flex Alexander]]). While Nico and Dallas are out, Van Helsing and his four employees storm the house and drive stakes through Richard and Panthia. They tie Ulrike to a bedpost, but she taunts the Crips into having sex with her before Van Helsing finally stakes her, too. They are unaware that to have sex with a vampire turns a person into a vampire. Suddenly, Nico walks in, horrified at the carnage. She attacks Trigger, who pulls a gun and tries to get off a shot. The bullet hits Rachel instead. Nico grabs the gun and shoots Trigger. Time Bomb subdues Nico with a rope of garlic, just as Dallas returns home and comes face to face with Van Helsing. In exchange for letting Nico go, Dallas offers to lead Van Helsing to The Count. So, Van Helsing, Time Bomb, Trigger, L'il Monster, Soda Pop, Nico, Rachel and Dallas pile into Van Helsing's van and head for The Count's house. Unfortunately, The Count's henchmen intercept them and take Nico and Van Helsing to The Count, where he hooks up Nico to a blood-draining machine and places Van Helsing in a box with only his head sticking out. Just as The Count is about to crack open Van Helsing's skull with a hammer, Dallas drives the van through the wall of the club. Dallas and the Crips, now vampires, come out shooting. Many bullets and stakes later, The Count and his henchmen are destroyed, Nico is set free, Rachel has been made into a vampire, and Nico, Rachel, and Dallas have decided to move to New York. In the closing scene, a pajama-clad Van Helsing runs down an alley, screaming for forgiveness from his son. As he utters apologies to God and his son Hans, he screams for help, revealing his new vampire fangs in front of two policemen.  
Mixing Nia
  The movie begins with Nia (Parsons), an upwardly mobile biracial woman working for an advertising firm in New York City. When Nia and her co-worker at the firm, Matt (Thal) are put in charge of marketing a malt-liquor beverage to [[African-American]] teens, Nia quits her job. She decides to presue her dream of writing a novel. She hopes to write about her [[Jewish]] father and African American mother meeting and living in [[Greenwich Village]] in the 1960s. In doing research and beginning her novel, Nia goes on an unexpected journey into her personal identity.  Though her circle of friends is of all races, she has spent most of her life identifying with the Jewish side of her culture, and is a self-proclaimed [[yuppie]]. She hopes to identify more with the African-American side of her heritage, and find an authentic black experience. Her first attempt at this is in enrolling in an African-American [[writing workshop]]. In this class she meets and falls for the instructor, Lewis (Washington). At the same time, she goes out with her former co-Worker Matt for drinks, and finds that he has had a long time attraction to her as well. Nia pursues both of these relationships, with each man exploring a different side of her identity. She begins to learn that the two sides of her identity clash, and that she can't even be "too much" of either race. She is at times too white for Lewis, who comments that maybe he should find a "real black woman", and leave Nia. She also at times feels out of place with Matt, feeling she does not fit in with his friends, and in some instances even feels isolated by their opinions and racial remarks.  Everything comes to a head when Nia invites both men to a wedding in which she is a bridesmaid. She is forced to make a decision between the two, but ultimately decides on being alone. She returns home, hoping to speak with her downstairs neighbor Joe (Serrano), a musician. During the whole movie she has had a fleeting flirty relationship with him, free of discussion of her race, and more about finding who she is as a person. She looks for him as her last person to turn to, but finds that he is gone, and has subleased his apartment for 6 months. Joe left a gift for her, a guitar, which inspires her to continue her novel, which she had given up on.  The movie ends with Nia, now reading a poem to the same audience that at one time she had been "too white" for, and Joe clapping for her in the audience.

The [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]] orders a general mobilization, with [[conscription]] notices requiring one man from each family to join the Chinese army. When [[Mulan (Disney character)|Fa Mulan]] hears that her elderly father Fa Zhou, the only man in their family and an army veteran, is once more to go to war, she becomes anxious and apprehensive due to his weakening health. Taking her father's old armor, she disguises herself as a man so that she can enlist instead of her parent. The family quickly learn of her departure, and Mulan's grandmother prays to the family ancestors for Mulan's safety. The ancestors order their "great stone dragon" to protect Mulan; a small [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] named [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Mushu|Mushu]], a disgraced former guardian, is sent to awaken the stone dragon, but accidentally destroys it in the process, which Mushu conceals from the ancestors and resolves to protect Mulan himself.  Reporting to the training camp, Mulan is able to pass as a man, although her military skills are initially lacking. Mushu provides clumsy guidance to Mulan on how to behave like a man. Under the command of Captain [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Li Shang|Li Shang]], she and her fellow recruits Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po gradually become trained warriors. Desiring to see Mulan succeed, Mushu creates a fake order from Shang's father, General Li, ordering Shang to follow the main imperial army into the mountains. The reinforcements set out, but arrive at a burnt-out encampment and discover that General Li and his troops have been massacred by the Huns.  As the reinforcements solemnly leave the mountains, they are ambushed by the Huns, but Mulan cleverly uses a cannon to cause an [[avalanche]], which buries most of the invaders. An enraged Shan Yu slashes her in the chest, and her deception is revealed when the wound is bandaged. Instead of executing Mulan as the law requires, Shang spares her life, but nonetheless expels her from the army. Mulan is left to follow alone as the recruits depart for the imperial city to report the news of the Huns' destruction. However, it is discovered that several Hun warriors, including Shan Yu, have survived the avalanche, and Mulan catches sight of them as they make their way to the city, intent on capturing the emperor.  At the imperial city, Mulan is unable to convince Shang about Shan Yu's survival. The Huns capture the emperor and seize the palace. With Mulan's help, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po pose as [[Concubinage|concubines]], and are able to enter the palace. With the help of Shang, they defeat Shan Yu's men; as Shang prevents Shan Yu from assassinating the Emperor, Mulan lures the Hun leader onto the roof, where she engages him in single combat. Meanwhile, acting on Mulan's instructions and signal, Mushu fires a large skyrocket at Shan Yu. The rocket strikes and propels him into a fireworks launching tower, where he dies in the resulting explosion.  Mulan is praised by the Emperor and the assembled inhabitants of the city, who bow to her in an unprecedented honor. While she accepts the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the Emperor and the sword of Shan Yu as gifts, she politely declines his offer to be his advisor, and asks to return to her family. Mulan returns home and presents these gifts to her father, who is overjoyed to have Mulan back safely. Having become enamored with Mulan, Shang soon arrives under the pretext of returning her helmet, but accepts the family's invitation to stay for dinner. Mushu is reinstated as a Fa family guardian by the ancestors amid a returning celebration.

Mr. Jealousy
  Aspiring writer Lester Grimm (Stoltz) starts going out with Ramona Ray (Sciorra) after being introduced by Lester's friend Vince ([[Carlos Jacott]]) and Vince's fiancee Lucretia ([[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]]). They immediately hit it off, but Ramona mentions on their first date that one of her ex-boyfriends is famous writer Dashiell Frank ([[Chris Eigeman]]). Lester becomes slightly jealous.  One day Lester is walking down the street and he spots Dashiell and follows him. He then notices how Dashiell goes to group therapy. He then joins the group, pretending that he is actually his friend, Vince. After several sessions with the group and Dr. Poke ([[Peter Bogdanovich]]), Dashiell is complaining about how he has never been faithful when Lester bursts out with some criticism that shocks everyone.   After a couple more sessions, Lester decides to leave the therapy group, which Vince strongly advises against, as he had asked Lester to talk about him to get some personal advice. Vince then convinces Lester to stay for two more sessions, where Lester continues to 'fight' Dashiell. During one particular session, Dashiell is talking about a character in one of his books, and says that it was based on a true person. We are then led to believe that he is talking about Ramona.  Lester still continues with the group therapy, even after the two sessions that he said was his last. After a session, Dashiell asks Lester if he would like to go for a drink. They go to a bar where they drink scotch and Dashiell reveals that he likes their arguments in therapy, since no one else speaks their minds. Lester had arranged to meet Ramona after the session, but has forgotten about it, while Dashiell and Lester become friends. When Lester goes to Ramona's house later, and apologizes for not meeting her, he lies and said that he went to see [[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]], and that it was shot in color, although if he had seen the film he would have known it was in black and white.   Dashiell invites Lester to come over to his house for a drink, and he agrees. Here we meet Irene ([[Bridget Fonda]]), Dashiell's girlfriend.   After the meeting, Lester and Ramona are lying on the bed, where Ramona reveals that a past boyfriend, Steven ([[Brian Kerwin]]), had come over and that they had had sex, but that it was before she and Lester were serious. She then says that her relationship with Steven is over, and that the sex hadn't meant anything.  Later, when Lester is having dinner at Ramona's house, Ramona reveals her sexual past, which proves that she couldn't be the character that Dashiell had described earlier. They then talk about the first time they slept together, which leads to an argument.   At the next therapy session, the true Vince joins the group, under a fake name as 'Leo' and adopts a British accent for the therapy. Vince then reveals Lester's problems to the group, but says that they are his own, even though Lester objects. After the session they have an argument.  In another session, Dashiell reveals that he had met Ramona coincidentally after a meeting, and that they had had sex. Lester then walks out of the session, to find Ramona. She is outside and they have an argument in the street, while the rest of the group come out to see what happens. All of the lies are revealed, and Dashiell punches Lester. Lester begins to walk away, then turns around, walks up to Dashiell and says "She's my girlfriend", and punches him. Lester and Ramona argue and break up.  Several months later, at the [[Iowa Writer's Workshop]], Lester working on his writing, and back in New York, Ramona has been going to Dr. Poke for therapy. The scene then shifts to Vince and Lucretia's wedding, where Lester and Ramona see each other. Lester outstretches his hand, asking Ramona to dance. At first she hesitates, saying how long it had taken for her to get over him, and he agrees. He then outstretches his hand again, and this time she accepts.

  The film begins with Joe Kavanagh at an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meeting, relaying an experience from his past. He states the ritualised greeting: 'My name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic.' He feels that he is not in a position to drink any more with safety. He tells the group that he copes by praying and states that he is grateful to be at the meeting.   He then goes round to his friend's place, bangs on the door and pretends to be the police. They then travel in Joe's van where they examine stolen sporting merchandise which is of low quality. Joe and his friends stop at another person's house to pick up more people. A car cuts off the van. Joe later encounters the driver, whom Joe later describes as being 'the woman who tried to kill us all.' He exits his van and asks the woman if she lost her [[guide dog]]. The woman, Sarah, states that she is a [[health visitor]]. She wants to see Liam and his child, but Joe explains that Liam has an important [[Association football|football]] game to attend.  Joe is very encouraging as a coach. The other team appears in white and black, which are the colours that Joe's team wears. Joe's team express their anger at this and respond by taking their shirts off so that they are able to distinguish between players. The other team scores the first goal of the game.  Joe drives Liam home and Liam abruptly tells Joe to pull over and Liam runs up to a male who acts aggressively towards him. Joe does not hear what transpires between Liam and the man. Later, Joe sees Sarah, who is seen struggling with wallpaper in her car. Joe appears to fancy her, as Sarah tells him her name and he [[flirt]]s with her.  Joe then helps an acquaintance of Sarah's to complete a wall papering and paint job in Sarah's flat. Sarah later brings them tea as they paint the ceiling and sing to themselves. They then look outside and notice someone taking photos of them through the window. Joe runs outside with his can of white paint and brush to confront the man who was taking the photos. The photographer tells Joe that he was just doing his job and that he has a bad heart. Joe then paints all over the photographer's car. The car speeds away and manages to knock over a pile of rubbish by the side of the road.  Later, Sarah and Joe have dinner together. There is a bottle of red wine on the table, but Joe does not drink any of the alcohol. Sarah's telephone rings and she leaves the kitchen to answer it. Joe is then left alone with the wine. He clears his plate and appears somewhat nervous. When Sarah finishes with her telephone conversation, Joe asks her about the photographs on her wall. Joe later reveals to Sarah that he does not drink, to which Sarah replies: 'Why didn't you say?' Joe reveals that he is an alcoholic and he has not had a drink in ten months. Joe is happy that Sarah knows and that she has been direct in her responses to him. Joe thanks Sarah for her company. Sarah pays Joe for the work that he completed on her flat and they part company.  Joe attends the Mayfield [[Clinic|Health Centre]]. Joe tells the receptionist that he would like to see Sarah. The receptionist does not appear to be surprised by his request and says that Joe is free to pop his head around the door. He sees Sarah advising parents on dealing with the changing of [[Diaper|nappies]]. Outside the Health Centre, Joe asks Sarah if she would like to go [[ten-pin bowling]] with him and to ring him if she fancies going. They then part company. Sarah speaks with a female colleague, Maggie, and says that Joe seems a bit wild. She states that she is not going to go bowling with Joe.  Sarah and Joe bowl together and laugh at their many errors. They occupy Aisle 16 and neither of them are spectacular players. They go back to Sarah's place where she asks him in for a cup of tea. Joe politely says no. Sarah offers him money for a taxi. A friendly argument ensues, at the end of which Sarah finds herself locked out of her flat. Sarah says that she can sleep in her car. Joe states that Sarah can sleep at his place, but not necessarily together.  They arrive at Joe's and he shows her around his flat. Joe tells Sarah that he used to be in a band and they won a local [[talent contest]]. Joe tells Sarah a story of how he was desperate for a drink one day and what transpired. He went to a music shop and stole some [[Compact Cassette|cassette]]s. He took one of them home and '[[Alcohol intoxication|got pissed]].' He describes the experience as being 'magical.' When Sarah asks him what made him stop drinking, Joe asks her why she wants to know. He is not hostile, but curious. Joe says that he is scared to tell her and that there is a strong chance that she will hate him if he tells.  Joe explains that there was a girl he used to drink with and they loved one another. They were both 'just tangled up' and they used to get into terrible arguments and tear one another apart. The audience then sees a flashback where Joe and the girl are returning home from a night out. He states that 'a cloud just descended... really, really dark. And suddenly I hated her. I hated me.' He describes how he tried to open the door, but was unable to; when the partner whom he was with laughed at him, Joe lost control because she found it funny. He beat her by punching and kicking her, while she lay helpless on the ground. He screamed abuse at her. The next day, he had a blackout. Now, he remembers every punch and kick. He states how ashamed and disgusted he is with himself. He is obviously contrite and he has not yet forgiven himself for his actions.   Joe sees three men beating up Liam at a football match. Joe attempts to intervene. He helps Liam up and asks him if he is still [[Drug detoxification|clean]]. Liam states that he is. Liam confronts his wife when she comes home. He suspects that she has been using and asks her if she 'takes him for a prick.' Liam then yells that he will leave her to rot, grabs her by her neck and forces her to look at herself in the mirror.  Joe goes to Liam's flat and encounters Liam's wife [[Drug injection|shooting up]] in the bathroom. An argument erupts between them. Joe offers to help her. She does not want the kind of help that Joe offers. Joe then reluctantly assists her to tie off one of her [[vein]]s so that she can shoot up. Joe tries to make sense of her incoherent mumbles as she lies prostrate in the bathtub. Joe then goes to a [[snooker]] club where he asks after Liam's whereabouts. Joe tells one of the men that he encounters that Liam has a four-year-old boy in an attempt to mitigate matters. Liam says that he does not want them to take liberties. He comes across Liam and is cross because Liam told him that he had stopped dealing. A tearful Liam confesses that he still owes money. Joe also tells Liam that he suspects that his wife is selling her body, and soul, for monetary gains. He is worried that people are going to break his legs.  The next day, Joe goes to Stella Maris' [[Bed and breakfast|B & B]] to deal with the matter of Liam. In a later scene, Joe gives Sarah a pair of earrings, as well as a ring. Joe tells Sarah that he loves her. Sarah tells him that she does not want it and Joe cannot understand what he has done wrong. Joe is confused as to why Sarah has behaved in this fashion. In the next shot, we see a copy of the Alcoholics Anonymous' small blue Bible as Joe listens to Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major and makes notes in a book. When Sarah arrives at his door, she apologises. They drink tea together and later embrace.  Joe drives his van and his mates direct him to a place where they rob another van. Joe is shocked with his unwitting role in the robbery of Astral Sports. He still acts as the get-away driver. At the next football match, Joe cleverly remarks that the other team look like [[Budgerigar|budgies]] because of their blue and yellow striped uniforms. Meanwhile, Sarah reveals to her co-worker Maggie that she is pregnant. Maggie congratulates her.  At Sarah's flat, she expresses her reservations about Joe's dealings with Liam. Joe tells her that there are some things that she does not need to know. Sarah accuses Joe of being a drug dealer and asks where he got the money for her earrings and ring. Joe replies that the gang gave him some money. Sarah becomes enraged and asks, 'Are you going to hit me too, Joe?'  Joe attends Liam's flat and states that Liam must deal with things himself. Joe returns to his flat with bottles of [[Smirnoff Vodka]]. He pours himself a drink, and takes a sip. Liam then goes to Joe's flat, where Joe is very inebriated.  Joe calls Liam a 'stupid wee prick.' The alcohol has overtaken Joe and he is hostile to Liam, who needs his help. As Liam witnesses members of the gang coming towards the premises, Liam realises that Joe has passed out and he kisses Joe on his forehead. Joe suddenly snaps awake and realises that Liam has taken his own life by hanging himself. The film concludes with Liam's funeral.

After a successful birth, Danny decides to himself that the baby girl born, Anna ([[Gretchen Mol]]), is meant to be with him forever, and states that he will marry her.  Twenty-five years later, Danny now 30 moves back to his hometown after his father dies. Homeless and jobless, Danny finds a cheap apartment owned by a bakery shop couple who offer him little jobs delivering cakes. During his first delivery, Danny gets lost and stops at Grace's for directions. Nina ([[Jennifer Tilly]]), Anna's blind sister, opens the door and Danny sees Anna for the first time.  Anna and Nina's family order a cake from the bakery and Danny immediately leaves to deliver it, hoping to see Anna, but crashes his bike into a car right outside the home, going unconscious. He awakes in Grace's house to meet Anna's entire family—her brother Billy ([[Jeremy Piven]]) and Billy's mentally distraught wife, Irene ([[Jane Adams (actress)|Jane Adams]]), her father Richard ([[Bruce Jarchow]]), her sister Karen ([[Martha Plimpton]]), and boyfriend Eric ([[Jon Tenney]]). He is invited to stay for dinner where he is given news of Anna's recent engagement to Eric.  Danny later gets the job as a tiler/mosaic artist in a local museum. Danny soon confesses his love for Anna, asking her to run away and marry him. Anna rejects him kindly and rides away, with Danny chasing her. At a bookstore, Danny tells Eric he is in love with Anna. Grace remains ill with a bed nurse. Anna later becomes jealous of the love between Nina and her new boyfriend Jesus, and rushes to Danny's home. The two then sleep together. At Billy's house, Irene screams at Billy and points a gun at him because she believes he is having an affair. She quickly shoots at Billy, hitting his foot, and laughs as he tumbles in pain.  Nina and Jesus have an informal elopement during the night. After Nina returns home to tell her mother gleefully, Grace passes away in Richard's arms. Anna leaves Danny's apartment to tell her mother about her relationship with Danny only to find that she has died. At Grace's funeral, Anna says she already told Eric about their affair. Danny tells Anna he is leaving in a couple of days and says goodbye. That night, Eric announces he and Anna are going to Paris to get married. The next day, Nina tells Anna that she loves Danny, not Eric, and advises her to go after Danny.  At the train station, Anna chases down Danny and begs him to take her with him. Danny says that it won't last. She holds up a regular coin and says if it lands heads, she may go with him. Without looking, he claims it is heads and the two kiss.

The Negotiator
 Lieutenant Danny Roman, a top [[hostage negotiator]] for the [[Chicago Police Department]], is told by his partner, Nate Roenick, that according to an informant whom he refuses to name, members of their own unit are [[embezzlement|embezzling]] large amounts of money from the department's disability fund, for which Roman is a board member. Roenick tells Roman that his informant hasn't told [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] because he thinks they might be involved as well. When Roman goes for another meeting, he finds Roenick dead seconds before other police arrive, pinning Roman as the prime suspect.  Matters become worse for Roman when IAD investigator Terence Niebaum, whom Roenick's informant suspected of involvement in the embezzlement, is assigned to investigate the murder. After the gun that killed Roenick is linked to a case Roman had worked on, Niebaum and other investigators search Roman's house and discover papers for an [[Offshore bank|offshore bank account]] with a deposit equal to one of the amounts of money embezzled. Roman is forced to surrender his gun and badge, and his colleagues are skeptical of his protests of innocence. With embezzlement and homicide charges pending, Roman storms into Niebaum's office and demands answers about who set him up. When Niebaum refuses to answer, Roman takes Niebaum, his administrative assistant Maggie, police commander Grant Frost and weak-willed [[con artist|con man]] Rudy Timmons as hostages.  With the building evacuated and placed under siege by his own CPD unit and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], Roman issues his conditions: locating Roenick's informant and killer and summoning lieutenant Chris Sabian, the city's other top negotiator. Roman believes he can trust Sabian, because he talks for as long as possible, sees tactical action as a last resort, and being from another precinct eliminates him as a suspect in the disability fund scheme. Sabian clashes with the CPD, but is given temporary command of the unit after they hastily attempt a breach that goes awry, resulting in two additional [[SWAT]] officers becoming Roman's hostages, one of which they believe he has killed.  Roman trades Frost to Sabian in exchange for restoring the building's electricity, having been turned off after the hostage execution. With help from Rudy and Maggie, Roman accesses Niebaum's computer and pieces together the scheme; corrupt officers submitted false disability claims that were processed by an unknown insider on the disability fund's board. He also discovers recordings of [[Covert listening device|wiretaps]], including a conversation that suggests Roenick was meeting his informant before he was killed. Sabian, using the information Roman provided, claims to have located Roenick's informant in a bid to get Roman to release the hostages. Roman realizes Sabian is bluffing when Niebaum's files reveal Roenick himself was the IAD informant.  When Roman threatens to expose Niebaum in an open window, leaving him vulnerable to [[sniper]] fire, Niebaum admits that Roenick gave him wiretaps implicating three of Roman's squad mates  Hellman, Allen, and Argento  in the embezzlement scheme. When Niebaum confronted the guilty officers, he received a [[bribe]] from them to cover up their crimes. They offered Roenick the same money, but when he refused to take it, their inside ringleader murdered him. Niebaum says he doesn't know who the ringleader is, but that he has the taps corroborating the three officers' guilt. The same corrupt officers have secretly entered the room via the air vents under the pretext of being part of a team to take Roman out in case he started killing hostages; upon hearing Niebaum's confession, they open fire and kill Niebaum before he can reveal where he has hidden the wiretaps. Roman single-handedly fends them and the rest of his squad off, using the flashbangs he seized from the two officers in the previous failed breach.  Believing that Sabian and the police cannot resolve the situation, the FBI assume jurisdiction over the operation, cease negotiations, relieve Sabian of his command, and order a full breach. As Roman prepares for his eventual arrest, Maggie tells him that Niebaum also worked at his house and could have kept Roenick's wiretaps there. Sabian confronts Roman to warn him about the breach, and Roman reveals that the corrupt officers murdered Niebaum and the "executed" hostage is still alive and gagged. Sabian begins to believe in Roman's innocence and gives him a chance to prove his case: while the FBI and SWAT raid the building and rescue the hostages, Roman disguises himself as a SWAT member and escapes.   Roman and Sabian proceed to Niebaum's house, but they can't find the wiretaps. The police arrive and the corrupt officers enter the house, but they back off as Frost enters and tries to talk Roman down. Sabian observes Frost discreetly taking one of the loaded guns, and realizes that Frost is the ringleader of the conspiracy and Roenick's killer. In front of Frost, Sabian seemingly kills Roman and offers to destroy the evidence they have uncovered in return for a cut of Frost's take. Frost agrees and effectively makes a full admission to his and the other three officers' crimes. When Frost exits the house, he discovers that Sabian only wounded Roman, who used a police radio microphone to broadcast his confession to the police surrounding the area. Humiliated, Frost attempts to commit suicide, only to be foiled and arrested by the police. As Roman is loaded into an ambulance, Sabian gives his badge to him and departs.

Henceforth, Willis and Glasscock rob banks at night and get away by car. Glasscock turns out to be an expert with [[nitroglycerin]]. Willis talks his brothers into supporting him. He tells them that bankers are the worst crooks of all and therefore robbing them of their money would only mean that little thieves are stealing from big thieves. He also says all banks are insured anyway and the [[insurance companies]] ought to be thankful because they would not be able to sell any insurance if there were no bank robberies.  The Newton gang is very prolific and some bankers prove to be the crooks Willis takes them for because they exaggerate their losses. Then the insurance companies force banks to invest in enhanced safes, which can withstand nitroglycerin.

He confuses Dock Newton with a guard, panics and shoots him. Willis needs to bring his wounded brother to a doctor, and this undertaking eventually blows their cover.

Their goal is to party at the Roxbury, a fabled [[Los Angeles]] [[nightclub]] where they are continually denied entry by a hulking bouncer.  By day, the brothers work at an [[artificial plant]] store owned by their wealthy father, Kamehl. They spend most of their time goofing off, daydreaming about opening a club as cool as the Roxbury together, and Doug using credit card transactions as an excuse to flirt with a card approval associate via telephone that he calls "Credit Vixen." The store shares a wall with a lighting emporium owned by Fred Sanderson. Mr. Butabi and Mr. Sanderson hope that Steve and Emily, Sanderson's daughter, will marry, uniting the families and the businesses to form the first plant-lamp emporium.  After a day at the beach the brothers decide that night was to be the night they would finally get into the Roxbury. Returning home, Doug gets into a heated argument with their father about going out clubbing instead of staying home. Their father has planned a dinner party with Emily and her parents. The angered Mr. Butabi then refuses them access to their [[BMW]] car and their cell phones. They are given enormous cell phones by their mother, Barbara, and allowed use of the fake-plant store's delivery van, but they are immediately rejected once again by the doorman.  After discovering they might bribe their way into the club, the brothers drive around looking for an ATM. They get into a fender-bender with [[Richard Grieco]] and, to avoid a lawsuit, Grieco uses his fame to get them into the popular club. There, they meet the owner of the Roxbury, Benny Zadir, who listens to their idea for their own nightclub. He likes them and sets up a meeting with them for the next day. The brothers also meet a pair of women at the Roxbury: Vivica and Cambi, who see them talking to Zadir and think that the brothers are rich. The women later sleep with Doug and Steve, leading the brothers to think they are in "serious relationships."  On the way to the after-party at Mr. Zadir's house, the brothers annoy his driver and bodyguard Dooey by making him stop to buy [[Whipped cream|fluffy whip]] and making jokes about sleeping with his parents. As revenge, the next day, Dooey refuses them entry into Zadir's office for their meeting. He tells the brothers that Zadir was drunk out of his mind last night and does not know who they are. In reality, Zadir wanted to see them, but does not have their contact information.  Vivica and Cambi break up with the Butabi brothers after realizing they are not actually wealthy. Afterwards, the brothers argue over who is at fault for their sudden misfortune and Doug moves out of their shared bedroom and into the guest house. Meanwhile, Steve is forced into an engagement with Emily by his father. The wedding is held in the backyard of the Butabi residence, but is interrupted by Doug. Having gone on a fluffy whip-fueled bender, he interrupts the wedding, reconciles with his brother, and the wedding is called off, only to be restarted as Craig, the Butabi brothers' personal trainer, reveals his feelings for Emily. Afterwards, Grieco (a guest at the wedding) talks to Mr. Butabi to help him understand that Steve was not ready for marriage, and that Butabi is too hard on Doug.  After the Butabi brothers reconcile with their father and Doug moves back into their bedroom, the film ends as the brothers happen upon a hot new club. The building is unique in that the exterior is constructed to resemble the interior of a nightclub, and the interior resembles a street—this was an idea pitched by Doug and Steve to Zadir earlier in the film. Attempting to enter, they are surprised to find their names already on the VIP list. In addition, Zadir reveals that to reward their idea, he has made them part-owners of the club. Their new-found success comes full circle when they meet two women in the club: Doug's phone operator from the credit card company ("Credit Vixen") and a police officer with whom Steve flirted while getting a ticket.

She kills the woman by hitting her with her car when she's walking in the parking lot after work. Beth then gets a call informing her that she got the job by default.  Beth's obsession with Lindsey grows even more once she establishes a relationship with her. She winds up babysitting her child, drugging him to make him fall asleep so she can photocopy Lindsey's journal, and steal her "April fresh" deodorant, and murders one of her other babysitters to get more time with her. And when one of Beth's co-workers learns how disturbed she really is from her former boss, she kills her too.  When Lindsey starts becoming suspicious about Beth, and tries to distance herself, she gets kidnapped at gunpoint and taken on a road trip. She eventually manages to get free, and after a scuffle in which she grabs Beth's gun, orders her (now using a pair of scissors as her "weapon") to back off. When she refuses and takes a threatening lunge, Lindsey reluctantly shoots her stalker to death, before breaking down in tears.  The closing scene shows Lindsey settling in as a national radio host in [[Los Angeles]], dedicating her first show to her best friend (and former manager) Nikki, who Beth also killed, and saying that she has much healing to do, before taking her first call from [[Jacksonville, FL]].

Claudia spends several days of thinking of her life, anguishing over being stuck between Charlie who would offer her excitement, adventure and unpredictability or Michael who would offer her stability, security and a stifling predictability.

A confused young girl (Siu Siu), whom psychiatrists believe has been imprisoned, is unable to tell anyone who she is. However, she has a photo of Chan, who doesn't recognise her. Chan receives a phone call from the girl's captor and realises he has intentionally released the girl. The serial killer then arrives at Chan's apartment, kills three detectives, and captures and taunts Chan, but does not kill her. Despite not having seen his face, Chan is convinced from the encounter he works in the police department. Soon, Officer Cheung Chi-chuen (Chan Wing-fai) is arrested, and the girl identifies him in a lineup. Before trial, Cheung is stabbed to death by the father of one of the victims.

Odoru daisosasen – The Movie
 The film continues a few months after the end of the TV series. The main character Detective Sergeant Shunsaku Aoshima has worked his way back up into the investigative division of the Wangan Precinct of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, after being demoted back to patrol duty for insubordination.  Shortly after the movie begins, a body is found floating in a river near the edge of the precinct's jurisdiction. However, in the spirit of the series, the main concern of the officers on the scene is getting to the body before their counterparts from the other precinct on the other side of the river get to it. The scene eventually degenerates into a cross-river shouting match over bullhorns between the officers from the two precincts. The brass at Wangan Station turn out to be less than happy when their officers manage to recover the body (which has had a [[teddy bear]] crudely stuffed into its stomach) as it would require a special investigation, which would drain more from the station's already tight [[budget]]. At the same time, the station is in an uproar as officers find that someone has been stealing the receipts for on the job expenses that they had originally intended to file for reimbursement.  Things are further complicated when the Assistant Commissioner is kidnapped and the investigative team from Metropolitan Police headquarters moves into Wangan Station. The investigation is led by Superintendent Shinji Muroi, whom Aoshima befriended in the TV series. Having promised Aoshima that he would try to reform the bureaucratic mess within the police department and force the local and headquarters officers to work together as equals, Muroi finds that his promise increasingly hard to keep as his decisions are continuously overruled from above by superiors who insist on playing everything by the book. It becomes apparent that Muroi's superiors are setting him up to take the fall in the event the investigation fails.  The stratification in the department becomes apparent when the investigators from headquarters immediately delegate the most menial of tasks to the local officers, while receiving special treatment enjoying gourmet [[bento]]s while the locals are forced to dine on instant [[ramen]]. The locals are forced to work multiple cases at the same time, and find themselves berated by their superiors when mistakes are inevitably made.  The film goes on to take on issues such as disaffected youth unable to differentiate between reality and video games, overprotective parents, strange internet subcultures; and on more lighthearted notes, the lack of sidearms, [[otaku]] obsessed with [[cosplay]], media frenzies, and even overtly melodramatic movie scenes, as Aoshima and his fellow officers continue to press on through the absurdity.

At a bar in town, they meet two extroverted women, Thelma and Holly, and buy them drinks.

Felix and Oscar are arrested a second time by the police.

A woman boarding the airplane is also en route to the wedding and recognizes them. She is Felice Adams, Oscar's ex-sister-in-law, the sister of his ex-wife, Blanche. Felix's eyes light up when he learns that her husband died of a heart attack. He calls her "Lise," which causes Oscar to ask Felix if she calls him "Lix."

Felix and Oscar argue with their ex-spouses, after which Oscar persuades his son to go through with it. Felix's suitcase is returned and the wedding goes off without a hitch.  The next morning, Felix and Felice leave on one flight and part ways with Oscar, who returns to Florida. Oscar is telling his poker friends about the wedding when the doorbell rings. It is Felix, who says things with Felice didn't work out. Felix wonders if he could move in with Oscar until he finds his own place. Oscar says no, but eventually relents, insisting their days of being roommates will be over if Oscar catches Felix matching any of his socks. Before long Felix is cleaning up the apartment and Oscar is overcome with a sense of having been through all this before.

One True Thing
 Ellen Gulden has a high-pressure job writing for [[New York magazine|''New York'' magazine]]. As the movie begins, she is visiting her family home for her father's surprise birthday party. It becomes obvious that she deeply admires her father, George, a once-celebrated novelist and college professor, but has barely restrained disdain for her mother, Kate, and the domestic life she lives. When it is discovered that Kate has cancer, George pressures Ellen to come home and take care of her mother. Ellen is taken aback by this request, knowing it could jeopardize her career and love interest, but finally agrees, caving in to her father's appeals and inducements.  As Ellen helps her mother with domestic chores while her father goes about his usual business without helping much, Ellen begins to reassess her views of her parents. She realizes she always brushed her mother aside and idealized her father, despite his self-centered focus on his career and - she discovers - longtime habit of having flings with his female students.   Ellen attempts to find a place for herself in her parents' life, while struggling to continue writing on a freelance basis and maintain her relationship with her boyfriend in New York. Over time, Ellen grows closer to her mother and learns more about her parents' marriage—including realizing that Kate has known about George's affairs all along. Ellen also learns that her father's philandering days have become lonely nights of drinking at a local bar to numb the pain of never again achieving success with, nor even being able to complete, further novels. George admits to Ellen that the reason he loved Kate was that she was full of light shining through everything, and he couldn't bear the thought of her light slipping away.  As her mother is dying, Ellen tells her she loves her, and Kate says she knew it and always had.   After Kate's death, the autopsy reveals that Kate actually died of a morphine [[drug overdose|overdose]], and a District Attorney questions Ellen about her mother's death.

She is planting daffodils when she sees her father approaching, their first encounter since the funeral. George tells Ellen she was very brave to do what she did, and she looks puzzled until she realizes George thinks she had given her mother the fatal overdose. Ellen replies that she had thought the accomplice was the father. They both realize Kate must have killed herself.  George speaks to Ellen of how much he loved Kate, considering her his [[muse]], his "one true thing." As the movie ends, Ellen is explaining to her father how to plant the daffodil bulbs and he is helping, foreshadowing, it seems, their reconciliation based on mutual long overdue appreciation of Kate.

Heartbroken, he goes to a strip club, gets drunk and becomes acquainted with one of the club's dancers, Ivy Miller ([[Reese Witherspoon]]). She suggests to Wyatt that he break up with Kim by sending her a scathing letter and a topless picture of himself with Ivy. Wyatt complies by sending the package through Global Express, an overnight delivery service.  The next morning, Kim calls Wyatt claiming "The Ricker" is a dog who she had to dogsit. Regretting his actions, he realizes he has 24 hours to retrieve the package before it gets to her. Wyatt and Ivy go to the Global Express office where, by chance, they encounter a spiteful classmate of Wyatt's ([[Sarah Silverman]]) who refuses to help them. Wyatt tries to talk the deliveryman ([[Larry Drake]]) into giving him the package, but he thinks Wyatt is a spy for the company, and refuses to break the rules.  Wyatt buys an air ticket to Memphis, but his co-passenger turns out to be a [[serial killer]], John Dwayne Beezly ([[Tobin Bell]]), who takes him hostage. Wyatt escapes and runs into Ivy on the road. Fearing that if he went back to the airport, the [[FBI]] would question him and he would not make it to Memphis in time, he begs Ivy to drive him all the way. They happen upon the Global Express delivery truck at a gas station. Wyatt breaks into the truck and locates the package, but the truck unexpectedly drives off. Ivy gives chase but despite their efforts they fail to retrieve the package.  At their next stop, [[Des Moines, Iowa]], airport officials do not allow Wyatt to board the connecting flight. So they decide to travel to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] to board another connecting flight. En route to St. Louis they have an argument which leads to an accident which ends up with their vehicle falling into the river. They have dinner in a cowboy diner and then try to run out on the check, but get arrested. After posting bail, they are let off and once again happen upon the delivery truck outside a diner. While the deliveryman is having dinner, Wyatt decides to empty the truck's gas tank in order to stall him, but a carelessly flung cigarette butt sets fire to the gas and causes the truck to explode. But even that doesn't stop the deliveryman (who is clearly over the edge by now) and he drives off. Wyatt and Ivy then steal a drunk's car and drive to Kim's campus.  After saying goodbye to Ivy, Wyatt gives chase to the delivery man and stops him in time. But after meeting Kim, Wyatt suddenly realizes that he loves Ivy and not Kim. After breaking up with her, he runs into another guy who is wearing the same kind of locket that Kim gave him long ago. Wyatt correctly surmises that the guy is none other than "The Ricker" and Kim ''was'' cheating on him after all. He allows the delivery man to deliver the package, and confesses his love to Ivy, who kisses him passionately.

Patch Adams (film)
 Hunter "Patch" Adams  ([[Robin Williams]]) is suicidal and admits himself to a mental institution. Once there, he finds that using humor, rather than doctor-centered psychotherapy, better helps his fellow patients and provides him with a new purpose in life. Because of this he wants to become a medical doctor and two years later enrolls at the Medical College of Virginia (now known as [[VCU School of Medicine]]) as the oldest [[Freshman|first year]] student.  He questions the school's soulless approach to medical care and clashes with the school's [[Dean (education)|Dean]] Walcott ([[Bob Gunton]]), who believes that doctors must treat patients as patients and not bond with them as people. Because of this and incidents such as setting up a giant pair of legs during an obstetric conference, he is expelled from the medical school, although he is later reinstated when it becomes apparent to the school that his unconventional methods often help cure his patients. Adams encourages medical students to work closely with nurses, learn interviewing skills early, and argues that death should be treated with dignity and sometimes even humor.  Patch begins a friendship with fellow student Carin Fisher ([[Monica Potter]]) and develops his idea for a medical clinic built around his [[philosophy]] of treating patients using humor and compassion. With the help of Arthur Mendelson ([[Harold Gould]]), a wealthy man who was a patient whom Patch met while in the mental hospital, he purchases 105 acres (425,000 m²) in [[West Virginia]] to construct the future [[Patch Adams#Gesundheit! Institute|Gesundheit! Institute]]. Together with Carin, medical student Truman Schiff ([[Daniel London]]), and some old friends, he [[renovation|renovates]] an old cottage into a clinic. When they get the clinic running, they treat patients without [[health insurance|medical insurance]] and perform [[Sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] for them.  Patch's friendship with Carin soon turns into romance. When she tells him that she had been [[child sexual abuse|molested]] as a child, Patch comforts her and reassures her that she can overcome her pain by helping others. Encouraged, Carin tries to help a disturbed patient, Lawrence "Larry" Silver (Douglas Roberts), only for him to murder her before commiting suicide. Patch is guilt-ridden by Carin's death and begins to question the goodness in humanity. Standing on a cliff, he contemplates [[suicide]] again and asks [[God]] for an explanation. He then sees a butterfly that reminds him that Carin had always wished she was a caterpillar that could turn into a butterfly and fly away. The butterfly lands on his medical bag and shirt before flying away. With his spirits revived, Patch decides to dedicate his work to her memory.  He is expelled from medical school a second time for running a clinic and [[practicing medicine without a license]] and because of complaints that he has made his patients uncomfortable (which is obviously not true). He files a grievance with the state medical board on the advice of his former medical school roommate, conservative Mitch Roman ([[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]). Patch succeeds in convincing the board that he must treat the spirit as well as the body. The board allows him to graduate and he receives a standing ovation from the packed hearing room.  At graduation, Patch receives his diploma and, bowing to the professors and audience, reveals his [[Mooning|naked bottom]].

Misha Vilyenkov ([[Tony Shalhoub]]), a Russian [[Emigration|immigrant]] and former teacher of literature, lives in America and works as a janitor at an animal testing lab. At the lab, Misha encounters Paulie and is shocked to see Paulie speaking fluent English. Subsequently, Paulie does not speak a word when Misha brings others to witness the talking bird.  Misha woos Paulie to tell his story by offering him pieces of [[mango]]. Paulie tells Misha about his original owner, a little girl named Marie ([[Hallie Eisenberg]]) who suffers from a severe stutter. The story transitions to a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scene in which Paulie is a baby bird. As Marie learns to speak properly, so does Paulie, beginning with understanding the meaning of words and progressing to the construction of complex sentences. Marie's father Warren ([[Matt Craven]]), a soldier, returns home from Vietnam and decides that Paulie is not helping Marie. The father's resentment of the close bond between Paulie and Marie, and their shared progress in speech development, is evident.  It becomes obvious that he wants Marie to forget Paulie, when the father brings her a cat. The cat and Paulie do not get along. Once again, Warren blames Paulie for Marie's speaking problems and believes she has imagined Paulie's ability to speak. Eventually after a dramatic event in which Marie falls off the roof in an attempt to teach Paulie to fly, Warren convinces Marie's mother Lila ([[Laura Harrington]]) to send him away.  Paulie is passed from one owner to another, eventually ending up in a pawn shop, where he spends his time insulting the customers. One day a shady customer named Benny ([[Jay Mohr]]) shows interest in buying Paulie, thinking he could profit from the bird's ability to talk. Before he can act, however, a widowed artist named Ivy ([[Gena Rowlands]]) purchases him with the intent of reforming his rude personality. She befriends the bird and agrees to help him find Marie who has moved across the country to [[Los Angeles]]. They begin traveling using her [[mobile home]] but when Ivy loses her sight in the middle of their trip, Paulie decides to stay and take care of her. After Ivy dies, Paulie, having finally learned to fly, continues his journey.  In East Los Angeles, Paulie joins a group of performing [[conure]]s owned by migrant musician Ignacio ([[Cheech Marin]]), temporarily forgetting about Marie as he develops feelings for a female conure named Lupe. At one of his performances, Benny, having also moved to L.A. recognizes Paulie and attempts to purchase him from Ignacio. When Ignacio refuses his offer, Benny makes a phoney police call at one of his performances. As the police show up, Benny kidnaps Paulie amidst all the chaos and Ignacio is arrested and presumably deported. Under Benny's influence, Paulie begins a life of crime. In a botched jewel theft, Paulie flies down through the chimney of a house, where he is trapped inside, then abandoned.  Paulie is then brought to the institute, his current home, where employees and scientists are stunned by his intelligence. They subject him to testing, and promise that he will be reunited with Marie. When Paulie discovers that he has been lied to by way of his acquisition as institute property, he refuses to cooperate with any more tests, humiliating Dr. Reingold (Bruce Davison), the head of the institute, in front of his scientific peers by acting like an ordinary parrot. As a result, his wings are clipped, and he is eventually imprisoned in the basement when he starts biting the researchers.  Moved by Paulie's story, Misha decides to give up his menial job to release Paulie and take him to Marie. After escaping from the institute and taking a bus to her address, they find her, now a full grown, beautiful young woman ([[Trini Alvarado]]) unrecognizable to Paulie, who believed Marie was her little friend. After a moment of confusion, Paulie and Marie are happily reunited as Marie sings Paulie's favorite song and he remembers her. The film ends with the three characters happily entering the house.  
The Pentagon Wars
 [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] Partridge ([[Kelsey Grammer]]) is in charge of the [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle]] project, that has been in development for seventeen years at a cost of $14 billion. In an effort to curtail excessive spending by [[The Pentagon]], Congress appoints an outsider, USAF Lieutenant Colonel James Burton ([[Cary Elwes]]) to observe the testing of several new weapons in development, including the Bradley.   Burton quickly becomes disillusioned by the way the process works in an atmosphere of corruption and inefficiency. He delves into the mountains of paper documenting the Bradley's history and comes to the conclusion that it is "a troop transport that can't carry troops, a [[reconnaissance]] vehicle that's too conspicuous to do reconnaissance, and a quasi-tank that has less armor than a snowblower, but has enough ammo to take out half of [[District of Columbia|D.C.]]"  Burton's attempts to test the Bradley under combat conditions are obstructed by Partridge and his two cronies, Colonel Bach ([[John C. McGinley]]) and Major Sayers ([[Tom Wright (actor)|Tom Wright]]). But then Burton is contacted by Brigadier General Robert L. Smith ([[Richard Schiff]]), the frustrated officer previously in charge of the vehicle’s production, who feeds him evidence on condition of anonymity.  Burton confronts Master Sergeant Dalton ([[Clifton Powell]]), in charge of the testing range, who admits being ordered to manipulate the test results, but bitterly tells Colonel Burton that every officer who tries to conduct honest tests eventually buckles under the pressure to gain his next promotion.  When Burton refuses to approve the Bradley without a live-fire test, insisting that the current version of the vehicle is a death trap, he loses his position and is ordered to Alaska. The report he is asked to write on the vehicle is rewritten by one of Partridge’s lieutenants. Following the army rule book, Burton then sends a memorandum referencing the original report to everyone who is technically involved in the project. This information leaks to the press and the resulting scandal leads to a [[Congressional Hearing]].  The hearing is humiliating to Partridge, who is ignorant of the Bradley overall and has to refer to the project documentation in order to answer even simple questions. The skeptical House Committee goes on to order the test that Burton has requested.  The night before, Burton visits the barracks on the range and tells Dalton and his men that, regardless of whatever orders they have received from Partridge, it is their duty to their fellow soldiers to make sure the test is performed honestly.    On the day itself, Partridge, Bach, and Sayers fully expect to confirm their story that it is perfectly safe, but Dalton and his men have actually made sure that the Bradley is not tampered with. When hit by an anti-tank round, the vehicle explodes spectacularly and stampedes the audience. Afterwards Dalton and his men confide to Burton that they had already become convinced of his sincerity and were with him ever since.  A postscript explains that the Bradley was extensively redesigned in response to Burton's demands, which significantly reduced casualties from its use during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. However, the [[Bureaucracy|system]] was too strong: Partridge and his cronies earned their promotions and lucrative private sector jobs, while Colonel Burton was forced to retire.

Later Steven returns expecting Emily to be dead but instead finds the hired killer dead in the kitchen. He quickly takes the key from the killer's pocket and puts it back on Emily's keychain. Police arrive, led by Detective Karaman ([[David Suchet]]). They remove the assailant's mask and the detective notices that Steven is surprised. That is because he sees that it is not David dead on the floor. Steven takes Emily to her mother's house, from where she attempts to call David (who watched a body being carried out the night of the murder and assumed it was her). Steven notices the phone line in Emily's room being used and presses redial once Emily is asleep to find she has called David. Later, David calls Steven and plays an audio tape of him on the day of the attempted murder and demands the remaining money promised.  Weeping, Emily tells her mother she has no intention of going home with David since she has decided to leave him. Later she goes to her best friend Raquel's house and over coffee they discuss reasons Steven would have to kill her. Racquel said that money was the first, but that given her financial status that Emily must have insisted on a prenup. She then reveals that Steven had offered but she turned him down so if she died, he'd inherit around $100 million. Shortly after, Emily uses her connections to speak to someone in the financial district where she learns of Steven's serious financial troubles. She then visits the detective where he says that he's gone over her case many times and only one thing concerns him: that the dead assailant didn't have a key.  Emily goes to their home in Manhattan and attempts to enter the front door, but her key doesn't work. She goes down to the doorman and asks if Steven had the locks changed; he says no. This spurs her to go to the apartment of the dead assailant to discover that her key unlocks his door. Emily confronts her husband with this and the knowledge of his financial problems. To her amazement, he exposes David's sordid past and accuses him of being a blackmailer conning her and threatening him. When he saw the attacker's dead body in their kitchen, he assumed it was David and took the key from his pocket so as not to implicate Emily in any way.  Steven goes to the bank to get the money, using a bag containing a shoe box to conceal it. He goes to David's loft but finds a note directing him to meet in a public place. The phone rings, and Steven picks up thinking it's David, but it's a ticketing agent confirming David's train out of the country. Steven meets David in a park and hands over the money; David gives him a copy of the tape and then leaves to board a train to Montreal. Once on the train and assuming he is safe, he opens the bathroom door in his cabin; Steven lunges out and stabs him, taking David's gun and the money back in the process. A dying David has the last laugh because he sent another copy of the tape to Emily. Steven rushes home to try to get the tape before she can. At the apartment, he finds the mail still unopened while Emily is on the terrace. He hides the money and tape in his safe before Emily enters the room.  Thinking his problems are over Steven takes a shower, but Emily sees the now disheveled bag that Steven was carrying before, alerting her to an issue. Steven exits the bathroom dressed for dinner and Emily suggest they stay in instead. She then suggest they have the locks changed since she still has not found her key. Emily pretends to leave to pick up food for dinner. Steven goes to the service entrance where he originally left the key for David. He finds it, and realizes that the killer had put the key back after using it to unlock the door. Emily confronts him, revealing that she knows everything now, having found the tape in the safe since the combination is their anniversary. Steven tells her his intentions of them working things out, but Emily says it's over and attempts to leave. Steven then attacks her and in the struggle she uses David's gun to kill him. The police arrive and she plays David's tape. She relays what happened after she told her husband that she knew what he had done and the Detective states she had no choice.  
Permanent Midnight
 Approaching the end of a [[drug rehabilitation]] program, Jerry Stahl (Stiller) quits his job at a fast food restaurant on an impulse when an attractive woman named Kitty (Bello) pulls up at the drive-through window. The two check into a motel, where Jerry tells her about his life between bouts of sex. A series of flashbacks, intercut with their conversations, details his working life to this point.  After moving to [[Los Angeles]] from [[New York City]], Jerry – already addicted to various prescription medications – becomes friends with another addict, Nicky (Wilson). At the urging of Nicky and his girlfriend Vola ([[Lourdes Benedicto]]), Jerry marries Vola's friend Sandra (Hurley) so she can get her [[permanent residence (United States)|green card]]. Sandra uses her position at a television studio to get Jerry onto the writing staff of the popular comedy series ''Mr. Chompers''.  He uses memories from his childhood, including his mother's hysterical grief over his father's death, to fuel his writing.  He juggles his ''Mr. Chompers'' job and regular visits to a [[heroin]] dealer, Dita ([[Liz Torres]]). However, his drug use eventually gets him fired. Sandra finds him a new job with a different series, ''No Such Luck'', but star Pamela Verlaine ([[Cheryl Ladd]]) – herself a recovering addict – sternly but sympathetically insists that he kick his habit first.  As soon as Jerry starts on a [[methadone]] program, he runs across a dealer named Gus ([[Peter Greene]]), who introduces him to [[crack cocaine]] and later [[Dilaudid]]. His increased drug use costs him his new job, and Sandra throws him out, disgusted at his decision to shoot up when she tells him she is pregnant. Her opinion of him falls even further when he shows up high for the birth of his daughter Nina.  While looking after Nina one night, he gets high and is arrested by the police. The incident further strains his relationship with Sandra, who makes it clear that she would prefer to see as little of him as possible.  The flashbacks end at this point, with Jerry returning to Los Angeles in hopes of being part of Nina's life.  As he begins to resurrect his stalled writing career, he gets a surprise visit from Kitty. The two have one last sexual encounter before she leaves to move to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]].  In the final scene, Jerry appears on a series of talk shows and news programs, while commenting in voice-over about the damage that his addiction has done to his life. "I got out with a bad liver and enough debt to keep me in hock 'til I'm 90, if I'm still here. And with my luck, I will be."  
Phantasm IV: Oblivion
 The film opens where the previous film left off. Mike flees from Boulton mortuary in the hearse, while Reggie is trapped inside by [[Tall Man (Phantasm)|The Tall Man]]'s spheres. Rather than kill Reggie, The Tall Man lets him go, saying he is doing so "to play one last game", then The Tall Man leaves Boulton.  Mike's brother Jody, now a steel sphere who can occasionally resume his human form, contacts and persuades Reggie to search for Mike. On the way, Reggie survives a demon attack and rescues a woman, "Jennifer", from a car accident.  They stay the night at an abandoned motel where Reggie tells her the story of [[Tall Man (Phantasm)|The Tall Man]].  Jennifer is not who she seems to be.  She attacks Reggie with two spheres, hidden in her breasts. Reggie vanquishes Jennifer with the use of his sledgehammer and [[tuning fork]].  Mike, tries to uncover the mysteries of The Tall Man in order to escape his transformation.  He drives, in his getaway hearse, through abandoned areas, recalling the last days of his youth before The Tall Man's arrival, and ends up in [[Death Valley]]. As the Tall Man interrupts his attempted suicide, Mike passes through a gateway. He meets a kind man, named Jebediah Morningside. Mike is frightened away, because Jebediah appears to be the Tall Man.   Back in Death Valley, Mike realizes that he can move rocks with the power of his mind.  Jody appears, but a distrustful Mike accuses his brother of having abandoned him. Mike begins working on the hearse's engine, seemingly using parts to build a makeshift sphere. Mike goes through a gate, but finds himself in a deserted city and escapes The Tall Man only with Jody's help.  Meanwhile, Reggie arrives at Death Valley and fights off a group of zombie dwarves shortly before Mike and Jody reappear through a gate.  Mike embraces Reggie and tells him not to trust Jody. Mike and Jody pass through the gate and appear in Jebediah's house.  Invisible to the old man, they witness how he perfects his craft and approaches the inter-dimensional gate.  Mike unsuccessfully tries to stab Jebediah, who vanishes and moments later is replaced by the evil [[Tall Man (Phantasm)|Tall Man]] who emerges in his place. The Tall Man can see Jody and Mike, forcing Mike to escape through the gate.  Jody finds Mike in a cemetery and attacks him. Awakening on a mortuary slab, Mike uses the tuning fork to immobilize Jody and the Tall Man as they attempt to saw his head open. He kills Jody with the sphere he built. The Tall Man quickly revives and [[telekinesis|telekinetically]] takes the fork from Mike. Again, Mike escapes through the gate back to Death Valley, this time pursued by his nemesis.  Reggie tries to shoot but is overpowered by The Tall Man. Mike then summons the sphere he built and uses it to impale The Tall Man in the neck. At this moment, Mike activates the hearse's motor, which turns out to be the true weapon, a strange inter-dimensional bomb, against the Tall Man. The Tall Man is once again supposedly vanquished. However, a new Tall Man immediately comes through the gate, revealing that The Tall Man is but one of many. The Tall Man removes the golden sphere from Mike's head and then passes through the gate.  Reggie arms himself and chases after The Tall Man through the gate. Mike recalls a childhood memory of him climbing into Reggie's ice cream truck as they both drive off into the dark night. Oddly enough, both of them hear each other's last exchange of dialogue from the present before Reggie went through the gate. Reggie asks Mike if he's hears the voice, but Mike brushes it off declaring, "it's just the wind".    
The Phantom of the Opera (1998 film)
 In Paris 1877 a pack of rats save an abandoned baby from a basket that was flowing along a river. They raise him in the underground of the Opéra de Paris. This child becomes the Phantom of the Opera, a misanthrope who kills anyone who ventures into his underground chambers, just as rats are killed whenever they venture above ground. The Phantom ([[Julian Sands]]) falls in love with the young opera singer Christine Daaé ([[Asia Argento]]), while she sings alone on stage one night. He appears before her and tells her that her voice fills his heart with light. After leaving, he speaks to her using [[telepathy]] and the two begin a romantic relationship.  The aristocratic [[Viscount Raoul de Chagny|Baron Raoul De Chagny]] ([[Andrea Di Stefano]]) has also fallen in love with Christine, though at first Christine offers him only a platonic relationship. Later, she ruminates that she may be in love with both men. One night, the Phantom calls to her and she descends to his lair across an underground lake in a boat. Upon arriving, she finds him playing an organ and he tells her to sing for him. Christine sings the same song he heard her sing when he first saw her onstage. After making love in his bed, the Phantom reveals his past to her. He tells her to stay in the lair while he goes to secure the role of Juliet for her but she refuses to stay alone, causing him to storm out. Christine grows angry with him and as he leaves in the boat she shouts that she hates him.   The Phantom threatens Carlotta, the show's spoiled diva, not to sing but she ignores the warning. During her performance as Juliet, the Phantom brings down the chandelier injuring many of the audience members. When he returns to Christine, she refuses the role he has secured for her. He becomes angry and forcefully rapes her. After Christine awakens, she witnesses the Phantom covered in his rats and petting them. While he is playing with the rats, she escapes on the boat. She flees into the arms of Raoul, and they ascend to the roof, where they confess their love for each other. The Phantom watches and breaks down crying when he sees them kiss.  The next night Christine sings as Juliet, but the Phantom swoops down onto the stage and she faints in his arms. Raoul and the police give chase. The Phantom carries Christine back down below and lays her down. When she awakens, he tells her that she is his and that they will remain alone together until death. She hits his face with a rock and calls to Raoul for help but instantly regrets her actions and her feelings for the Phantom return. Raoul appears and shoots the Phantom in his stomach with a rifle. Christine screams and cries for the Phantom, surprising Raoul.  Though mortally wounded, the Phantom's main concern becomes Christine's safety, as he fears that the police will kill her now they know she's with him. The Phantom leads them to the lake. Raoul and Christine get in the boat but the Phantom remains on the dock and pushes the boat away. He tells Raoul to get out of the cave and out to the river. Raoul does so, ignoring Christine's screams and objections. The Phantom fights the police but is stabbed in the back. He hears Christine calling him "My love" and cries out her name before falling into the lake and dying. The rats watch sadly as his body drowns and Christine weeps, heartbroken.  
Phantoms (film)
  Dr. Jennifer Pailey brings her sister Lisa to the resort town of Snowfield, Colorado, a small ski resort village nestled in the Rocky Mountains where Jenny works as a doctor. Once in town, the sisters find no one around but a few corpses. At first their suspicions are that of a serial killer on the loose in town. The sisters stumble upon the severed heads of the town baker and his wife in an oven when they are found by Sheriff Bryce Hammond, a former FBI agent, and his deputies Stu Wargle and Steve Shanning.  Hammond and his deputies are investigating the killings.  The group arrives at a nearby hotel and find the writing of a victim on the mirror reading "Timothy Flyte". Shanning leaves to investigate a sound outside but doesn't return. The others find only his gun, hat and shoes while the rest of him is gone. They return to the sheriff's office to request aid and create roadblocks around Snowfield.  The group gets a strange phone call but are interrupted by an attack by a bizarre moth-like creature that rips Wargle's face off before Hammond is able to kill it.  Lisa later encounters Wargle while in the bathroom.  They quickly return to the morgue and find his body missing.  Hammond's FBI associates find Flyte, a British academic who theorizes the town has fallen victim to the Ancient Enemy, an entity he generalizes as "chaos in the flesh".  It periodically wipes out civilizations including that of the [[Mayans]] and the [[Roanoke Island]] colonists.   They are soon joined by the remains of an Army commando unit who has come to Snowfield.  They, along with Flyte, investigate the only survivor of an attack by a dog-like creature that the survivor says converted the others in his group.  The unit members are systematically killed by the creature.  The last to die vomits a sample before turning into a puddle of black liquid.  Through it, Flyte and the group learn the nature of the Ancient Enemy.   Revealed to actually be an Earth-based amoebic life form that mimics its absorbed victims while gaining their knowledge, the Enemy creates Phantoms as temporary detachments for it to act through before absorbing them back into it. Furthermore, the Enemy absorbs all of the thoughts of its victims, making it extremely intelligent, and because of the previous civilizations' perception of it, it believes itself to be a god.  It had arranged all of the prior events so Flyte can assist the creature in revealing its existence to the world. Flyte also learns that the creature's body is physiologically almost identical to crude oil, and could be killed by bacteria bio-engineered to ingest fossil fuels.  They deduce that with the limited amount of the bacteria they have, they need to get the bacteria into the nucleus that is within the main body of the Enemy.   They form a plan to use the Ancient Enemy's extreme arrogance and god complex against itself.  To do so, Flyte acts as if he is turning against the group by revealing their entire plan to the Enemy.  In anger (and believing itself indestructible due to being a god), it reabsorbs all the Phantoms and then emerges from the sewers to assume a Mother Mass form.  Hammond and the Pailey sisters fire the bacteria into the Ancient Enemy before it retreats underground with Hammond in pursuit.  While the Pailey sisters find themselves dealing with Wargle's Phantom, Jenny seemingly kills it with a gun containing the bacteria.  Hammond finds the Ancient Enemy as it has assumed the form of the boy he accidentally killed during an FBI drug raid. When the boy grabs the last vial from him, Hammond shoots at it to expose the creature to its contents.  It dies from the bacteria.  Though Hammond reassures Lisa and Jenny that it is gone, with the former stating the townsfolk are at peace, Flyte admits the Ancient Enemy did achieve its victory as he has decides to tell the world what happened with a book based on what occurred in Snowfield. Some time later, watching Flyte being interviewed about his book, ''The Ancient Enemy'', two bar patrons argue about the existence of alien life. Hearing laughter nearby, the patrons turn to see Wargle as he asks them if they want to see something interesting.

Pizza, Beer, and Cigarettes
 This story takes place in an impoverished district outside [[Buenos Aires]].  It tells about a corrupt group of teenage misfits: the not-so-bright Megabom (Alejandro Pous), the asthmatic Pablo (Jorge Sesan), the nerdy Frula (Walter Diaz), and Sandra (Pamela Jordan), the pregnant girlfriend of El Cordobes ([[Héctor Anglada]]).  All are squatters living together in the same house. The group wanders the city and steal in order to survive. After letting go of their former employer, a crooked taxi driver who paid them a cut of what they could steal from his passengers, Pablo and Cordobes steal from a crippled street vendor, which ultimately leads to Sandra being arrested.  Sandra, because of her pregnancy, starts to think about her future and the life she can make for her expected baby. When she is released from jail after a short time inside, she makes Cordobes promise he'll straighten up and find a decent job instead of stealing again. In the meantime, she stays with her abusive father. Aided by his friends, Cordobés starts looking for more profitable scores, so he can move to Uruguay with Sandra.  Frula arranges a job with his contact, Rubén which involves stealing a fancy restaurant with unreliable guns. Rubén drives them to the spot which turns out to be an ordinary place. The stickup goes sloppily and the alarm goes off, urging the five robbers to escape. Rubén cuts ties with the others after paying Cordobes a misery for his job.  Running out of time, the group decides to rob a local nightclub. Pablo and Cordobes get back in touch with the cab driver, only to beat him up and steal both his money and his guns. However, they grow fond of the passenger, a middle aged woman from Cordoba, and let her arrive to her destination safely. Immediately after being let out of the car, the woman discreetly calls the police, who begins tracking the stolen cab. Back at the nightclub, Pablo, Frula and Cordobes get past the bouncer and proceed to hold the ticket workers at gunpoint while Pablo acts as a diversion, with Megabom as lookout outside the club. The bouncer, however, barely manages to notice Pablo and Megabom switching guns, so he begins acting more suspiciously. While the others start taking the money, Megabom notices a policeman following them, and proceeds to bother him and damage his motorbike in order to create a distraction. When Cordobes gets out of the ticket office, gun in hand, he is shot in the chest by the bouncer, who is then killed by Pablo. Hearing the screams and gunshots inside, the policeman attempts to enter the nightclub, but begins to beat down Megabom after he hits him in the back. When Frula, Cordobes and Pablo get to the cab, Frula catches a glimpse of the bloody and bruised Megabom. Enraged, he draws his gun at the officer, but is quickly shot down. Pablo manages to escape carrying a badly wounded Cordobes and steals another car. He drives him to the docks and gives him the money, so he can leave with Sandra, while staying behind to turn himself in.  Crawling, Cordobes manages to get to the docks, where he realizes he won't make it to the boat. Reunited with Sandra, he is forced to confess he didn't make good on his promise, and tells Sandra she should go alone, for the kid's sake. They kiss farewell, and a dying Cordobes manages to get a final look at Sandra while the boat departs. When the police arrive, they find his dead body and inform the station via radio.  
Phoenix (1998 film)
 In [[Phoenix, Arizona]], Harry Collins is a cop whose compulsive gambling has indebted him to a local gangster, Chicago.  As his losses mount and time counts down, Collins resorts to exploiting a young woman, Veronica, that he has picked up to distract his friends in a poker game.  Despite the successful distraction, he still loses, and he rejects Veronica's sexual advances, as he considers her to be bad luck.  When Collins drops her off at her house, Veronica's mother sees her daughter in tears and glares at Collins.  Collins later tracks down Veronica's mother, Leila, and defends himself, stating that he did not have sex with her.  Unimpressed, Leila rebukes him, which causes him to reassess his behavior and offer a sincere apology.  Surprised by his apology, Leila slowly warms to Collins, and they begin a romance.  Having lost his lucky lighter, Collins asks her for a keepsake, but Leila tells him that he must make his own luck and avoid whatever trouble in which he's become involved.  Meanwhile, Chicago cuts off Collins from his bookies and gives him 48 hours to either repay his debt or murder Joey, a young suspect held in custody.  Mike Henshaw, Collins' corrupt partner, suggests murdering Chicago, but Collins, unwilling to welch on a bet or murder Joey, decides instead to rob Louie, a local loanshark.  Collins recruits Henshaw and another corrupt cop, James Nutter, and, over their objections, brings in a more straight-laced cop, Fred Shuster.  Unknown to the others, Shuster has discovered that his wife, Katie, is having an affair with Henshaw.  Distraught and feeling betrayed, Shuster agrees to work with Lt. Webber to bring down the corrupt cops.  However, the robbery is botched when the trigger-happy Henshaw kills Louie before he can open the safe.  Collins hires a local locksmith to crack Louie's safe, and the group splits up.  Collins and Shuster arrive at the meeting point, but Lt. Webber is already there; Webber betrays Shuster, killing him, and shoots Collins in the gut.  Collins escapes, but Webber steals the money.  Nutter and Henshaw, suspecting that Collins has betrayed them, arrive at the meeting point and discover Shuster's body.  Before they can track down Collins and kill him, they are surrounded by the police.  When Nutter attempts to surrender, Henshaw kills him; Henshaw is killed in turn by the other cops.  Collins hitches a ride back to town and surprises Katie and Webber, who are having an affair.  Over their objections, Collins burns most of the money while denouncing them both for betraying Fred.  After alerting the cops to Webber's involvement, Collins takes enough money to pay off his gambling debt and meets with Chicago.  Amused, Chicago accepts the money but mocks Collins' reluctance to murder Joey; Chicago reveals that he has had Joey murdered in prison and points out that had Collins simply murdered Joey, all of this trouble could have been avoided.  Enraged, Collins kills Chicago and his bodyguards, then stumbles back to his car, where he apparently dies of his wounds.  
Pig (1998 film)
  Running about 23 minutes, ''Pig'' is a disjointed, heavily stylized and minimalistic film depicting a serial killer (Williams) journeying out to an abandoned house in [[Death Valley]] where he proceeds to ritualistically murder an unidentified man (Hollan). The film details their unspoken relationship through sadomasochism and symbolism.  The movie opens with the scene of the black-garbed killer preparing to disembark from a small house. The individual places several items into a brief case, appearing among them a deck of cards, a notebook, and a copy of the children's novel ''Mr. Pig and Sonny Too'' — an actual publication written in 1977 by the American author [[Lillian Hoban]].  The individual closes up his brief case, standing upright and turning to reveal on camera the bleeding, half-naked body of another man lying prostrate on the floor. The living man kicks aside the corpse of the dead one and continues downstairs, placing his belongings into a black car and driving away along a deserted road.  The driver continues through the outstretched desert with power lines lining the side of the dirt trail. His vehicle passes an outcrop of rocks with an inscription painted on its face. Although perhaps being unintelligible, it appears to read either as "ELLE" or "ELLIE". Another sign crops up immediately after, written in black, reading Dead Man’s Point though this is almost unreadable.  The film cuts to another individual, the unidentified man (Hollan), masked in white bandages covering his head. He wanders through the desert until reaching a telephone pole and sitting down, cross-legged.  The driver's car pulls up to the side of the road, and the masked figure enters on the passenger's side. The two drive down another path and stop at a small house. Upon exiting the vehicle the film continues to a shot of the driver/killer leading the masked figure by a rope which binds his wrists, all the while carrying his brief case. The dilapidated doorway to the house is shown to have the number "1334" laid out in small bones at the top, otherwise adorned with [[dominoes]], a crucifix, [[caution tape]], a glove, a knife, and various photographs of someone's arms and head being bound.  As the camera zooms onto the door frame, the scene cuts to the victimized masked man's arms being tied with [[Gauze|gauze tape]], and then finally at the bottom of the doorway a box of dominoes opens up to reveal a keyhole. Through the keyhole a pig mask can be seen sticking through a broken wall. It is revealed that the killer is wearing the mask and pacing about the house.  The scene cuts again to a corridor in the house—the word "Look" is [[graffiti]]ed along the wall where the masked man is bound at the wrists to a rope connected to the ceiling. The camera spins around the room before showing the two men outside again, this time the masked victim being led by his rope into a cellar. There the victimizer empties his entire brief case, among his things a deck of pornographic cards, a large metal key, a wig, a black [[dice|die]] with a chaosphere engraved on one side, a bondage mask, gloves, a chain, a bowie knife and other assorted cutlery, a cleaver, a pair of pliers, papers, at least two pairs of scissors, a plastic funnel with a feeding tube, and (perhaps most importantly) a book entitled ''Why God Permits Evil'', among other items.  The captor places his hand on the head of the now once-more bound-to-the-ceiling victim and pulls part of the bandage-mask from his eye, exposing his darting gaze and sense of fear. A collection of pliers, knives, scissors, syringes, and other instruments from the briefcase can be seen below.  In the next scene the killer is turning through the pages of ''Why God Permits Evil'', revealing strange, graphic art and religious quotes. The camera then cuts to the victim, his head still gauzed, with the feeding tube in his mouth. The killer pours what appears to be blood through the funnel, into victim's mouth, causing him to gag and choke, spitting it up onto his naked torso.  
Pi (film)
  Max Cohen is the story's [[protagonist]] and [[unreliable narrator]]. Unemployed and living in a drab [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] apartment in [[New York City]], Max is a [[Number theory|number theorist]] who believes that everything in nature can be understood through numbers. Max suffers from [[cluster headache]]s, as well as extreme [[paranoia]], [[hallucination]]s, and [[social anxiety disorder]]. His only social interactions are with Jenna, a young girl who is fascinated with his ability to calculate large numbers in his head; Devi, a young woman living next door who sometimes speaks to him; and Sol Robeson, his old mathematics mentor who is now an invalid.  Max tries programming his computer, Euclid, to make stock predictions. In the middle of printing out its picks, Euclid prints out a seemingly random 216-digit number, as well as a single pick at one-tenth its current value, then crashes. Disgusted, Max tosses the printout away. The next morning, he checks the financial pages and sees that the pick Euclid made was accurate. He searches desperately for the printout but cannot find it. Sol becomes unnerved when Max mentions the number, asking if it contained 216 digits. When Max questions him about the number, Sol indicates that he came across it many years ago. He urges Max to slow down and take a break.  At a coffee shop that he frequents daily, Max meets Lenny Meyer, a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jew]] who coincidentally does mathematical research on the [[Torah]]. Lenny demonstrates some simple [[Gematria]], the correspondence of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] to numbers, and explains how some people believe that the Torah is a string of numbers that form a code sent by God. Max takes an interest when he realizes that some of the number concepts Lenny discusses are similar to other mathematical concepts, such as the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]]. Max is also approached by agents of a Wall Street firm; one of the agents, Marcy Dawson, offers Max a classified computer chip called "Ming Mecca" in exchange for the results of his work.  Using the chip, Max has Euclid analyze mathematical patterns in the Torah. Once again, Euclid shows the 216-digit number on the screen before crashing. As he begins to write down the number, Max realizes that he knows the pattern, undergoes a sudden [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], and passes out. After waking up, Max appears to become clairvoyant and is able to visualize the stock market patterns he had been searching for. However, his headaches also increase in intensity, and he discovers a strange vein-like bulge protruding from his right temple. Max has a falling out with Sol after the latter urges him to quit his work.  One evening, Dawson and her agents grab Max on the street and try to force him to explain the number. They had found the original printout Max threw away and had been trying to use it to manipulate the stock market in their favor; however, they caused the market to crash. Lenny drives by and manages to get Max away from them. However, Lenny takes Max to his companions, who want Max to give them the number. At a nearby synagogue, they reveal their intentions: they believe the 216-digit number was meant for them to bring about the [[messianic age]], as the number represents the [[Shemhamphorasch|unspeakable name of God]]. Max refuses, insisting that whatever the source of the number is, it has been revealed to him alone.  Max flees and tries to visit Sol, only to find out from his daughter, Jenny, that he has just died from another stroke. Searching Sol's apartment, Max eventually finds a piece of paper with the number. Back in his own apartment, Max experiences another headache, but resists the urge to take his painkillers. Driven to the brink of madness, he destroys part of Euclid. Believing that the number and the headaches are linked, Max tries to concentrate on the number through the pain. After passing out, Max has a vision of himself standing in a white void and repeating the digits of the number. The vision ends with Max hugging Devi, who turns out to be a hallucination. Standing alone in his trashed apartment, Max burns the paper with the number and blithely performs an impromptu [[trepanning]] on himself in the right cerebral hemisphere with a power drill.  Some time later, Jenna approaches Max in a park and asks him to do several calculations, including 748 ÷ 238, which is an approximation for [[Pi]]. Max smiles and says that he doesn't know the answer to them. He sits on the bench and watches the trees blowing in the breeze, seemingly at peace.  
Pleasantville (film)
 David and his twin sister Jennifer lead very different high-school social lives. Jennifer is shallow and extroverted; David is introverted and spends most of his time watching television. One evening while their mother is away, they fight over the TV. Jennifer wants to watch a concert on [[MTV]], but David wants to watch a marathon of ''Pleasantville'', a black and white 1950s sitcom about the idyllic Parker family. During the fight, the remote control breaks, and the TV cannot be turned on manually.  A mysterious TV repairman shows up, quizzes David about ''Pleasantville'', then gives him a strange remote control. The repairman leaves, and David and Jennifer resume fighting. However, they are transported into the Parkers' black and white ''Pleasantville'' living room. David tries to reason with the repairman (with whom he communicates through the Parkers' television), but he succeeds only in chasing him away. David and Jennifer must now pretend they are Bud and Mary Sue Parker, the son and daughter on the show.  David and Jennifer witness the wholesome nature of the town, such as a group of firemen rescuing a cat from a tree. David tells Jennifer they must stay in character and not disrupt the lives of the town's citizens, who do not notice any difference between Bud and Mary Sue, and David and Jennifer. To keep the show's plot, Jennifer dates a boy from high school but has sex with him, a concept unknown to him and everyone else in town.  Slowly, Pleasantville begins changing from black and white to color, including flowers and the faces of people who have experienced bursts of emotion and personal  transformation. David introduces Mr. Johnson, owner of the burger joint/soda fountain where Bud works, to colorful modern art via a book from the library, sparking in him an interest in painting. Johnson and Betty Parker fall in love, causing her to leave home, throwing George Parker, Bud and Mary Sue's father, into confusion. The only people who remain unchanged are the town fathers, led by the mayor, Big Bob, who sees the changes eating at the values of Pleasantville. They resolve to do something about their increasingly independent wives and rebellious children.  As the townsfolk become more colorful, a ban on "colored" people is initiated in public venues. Eventually, a riot is touched off by a nude painting of Betty (painted by Johnson) on the window of Mr. Johnson's soda fountain. The soda fountain is destroyed, [[book burning|books are burned]], and people who are "colored" are harassed in the street. As a reaction, the town fathers announce rules preventing people from visiting the library, playing loud music, or using paint other than black, white, or gray. In protest, David and Mr. Johnson paint a colorful mural on a brick wall, depicting their world, prompting their arrest. Brought to trial in front of the town, David and Mr. Johnson defend their actions, arousing enough anger and indignation in Big Bob that the mayor becomes colored as well.  Having seen Pleasantville change irrevocably, Jennifer stays to finish her education, while David uses the remote control to return to the real world.

The Players Club
 The story is presented as a memory of Diana Armstrong ([[LisaRaye]]) sparked by her arrival at the scene of the raunchy, dysfunctional Players Club. She explains that she used to work at the club, beginning working there after getting pregnant with her son and getting into a heated argument with her father, prompting her to move out of her parents' home. Initially, Diana ends up working at a shoe store. There she meets Ronnie (Chrystale Wilson) and Tricks ([[Adele Givens]]), who work for Dollar Bill ([[Bernie Mac]]) at The Players Club. They convince Diana she would make better money [[striptease|stripping]], saying, "Use what you got to get what you want."  Dollar Bill gives Diana a job and the name Diamond. Her job initially goes well. However, four years later her younger cousin Ebony Armstrong ([[Monica Calhoun]]) comes to live with her after leaving Florida. After listening to Dollar's rendition of "The Strippin' Game", she starts working at the club.  Ebony is soon out of control - drinking excessively, staying out all night ,and influenced more and more by Ronnie and Tricks, who encourage Ebony to do more out-of-club parties for groups of men. Diana tries to warn Ebony to stay away from Ronnie and Tricks and to quit doing house parties, but Ebony rebels against being told what to do and ignores Diana's advice.  After a heated confrontation with Ebony, Diana has a flashback to a time when she was at a private party with Ronnie and Tricks. Diamond passes out on the bed drunk, and the men at the party offer to pay Ronnie to perform cunnilingus on Diamond. Ronnie accepts the offer and proceeds to assault Diamond. The flashback encourages Diana to continue to try to protect Ebony. Clyde ([[Alex Thomas]]) and Reggie ([[Ice Cube]]) - two watchmen who work for a drug lord named St. Louis - offer Ebony money to come off and have sex with them, but Diana intervenes.  Meanwhile, Dollar Bill gets confronted by a man who works for St. Louis, a drug lord to whom Dollar Bill owes $60,000. He warns Dollar Bill if he doesn't make a payment of $10,000 to St. Louis, he will hunt him down. That same night, St. Louis comes to his club to collect. L'il Man, the doorman of the club, tells St. Louis that Dollar Bill is not at the club; St. Louis and his men leave. The next day as Dollar Bill tries to leave the club, St. Louis' men Brooklyn ([[Charlie Murphy]]) and KC ([[Terrence Howard]]) confront him. They beat him unconscious and throw him into the back of his car. Luckily for him, they are stopped by Freeman ([[John Amos]]) and Peters ([[Faizon Love]]), two crooked cops. Dollar Bill is found in the trunk and is arrested on warrants; he is later bailed out and returns to the club.  The following night rapper [[Luther Campbell|Luther "Luke" Campbell]] comes to the strip club, Reggie and Clyde discuss him. When Dollar Bill is notified that Luke is at his club, he alerts the strippers via a money alarm, believing he will make a fortune. Clyde attempts to meet Luke, but Luke's bodyguard ([[Michael Clarke Duncan]]) informs Clyde that Luke is trying to relax and not meet with fans. Clyde insults the bodyguard, causing him to hit Clyde in the back of his head as he starts to walk away. The bodyguard, Luke and the others in the VIP section all laugh. In retaliation, Reggie grabs a chair, smashes it over the bodyguards head and beats down the bodyguard and belligerently fights against Luke and his friends, only for him to be gang-beaten and thrown into a glass window. The dazed Reggie opens fire wildly before being knocked out by the bouncer XL ([[Tiny Lister]]). Clyde then gets up and begins throwing punches himself.  Further tension develops between Ebony and Diana when Diana returns home one night after fleeing her obsessive customer Myrin, who admitted to stalking her and then tried to force entry to her apartment, to find Ebony in bed with her boyfriend Lance. Diana chases Lance out with her gun, shooting at him several times. Diana threatens and taunts Ebony. When Diana feigns leaving, Ebony is hit when she opens the door and is thrown out the apartment.  Diana then begins dating Blue ([[Jamie Foxx]]), a DJ at the Player's Club. Meanwhile, Ebony is offered a gig to dance at Ronnie's brother Junior's ([[Samuel Monroe Jr.]]) bachelor party, under the pretense from Ronnie that other girls from the club will be dancing there as well (In actuality, Ronnie lied to use her as a way out of stripping for her brother's friends at the party so Ebony can strip for them instead). When Ebony realizes that she will be the only woman in a hotel room full of horny men, she desperately tries calling Diana to come and pick her up, but to no avail.  Reggie and Clyde, both feeling insulted by Diana and Ebony from a previous encounter (she tells them she's not interested anymore), tell Junior that Ebony will have sex with him, claiming that they "ran a train" on her. Excited, Junior bursts in on Ebony while she is changing. Ebony resists, prompting Junior to brutally beat and rape her, leaving his friends to listen to it in full disgust and disbelief. Soon, Reggie, Clyde and the other guests leave, wanting no further involvement with Junior. When Ronnie discovers Ebony unconscious, she and Junior flee the hotel room as she scolds him. Later, Diana has a change of heart and she and Blue decide to check up on Ebony at the hotel, only to discover her bloodied and unconscious body on the bed.  Furious, Diana grabs her gun and goes to the Players Club, where Ronnie and Tricks are hiding out. After scaring the other strippers away by firing a warning shot, Diana gives the gun to Blue to cover her while she gets into a brutal fistfight with Ronnie, leaving Ronnie badly beaten. Diana punches Tricks and this prompts Dollar Bill to firing her from the club. Diana says final insults to Dollar and alongside with Tricks, Dollar and the others check on a beaten and bruised Ronnie and nurse her facial injuries.  Ronnie and Tricks are arrested by the police on charges of the rape of Ebony, and Junior had been arrested moments before. Later that night, Diana's timing proves to be perfect when St. Louis, comes to collect. He personally shoots up the club (though he does give warning to the customers beforehand, allowing them to leave). As he desperately tries to escape, Dollar is captured by Reggie, Clyde, and St. Louis' associate, whom Dollar Bill met earlier. Later, one of St. Louis' men Brooklyn destroy the club with a [[LAW rocket]].  Ebony, still sporting the bruises from her rape, now has a job working at the shoe store. Having been berated by two strippers who work at a new club, called Club Sugar Daddy's, with the same slogan that influenced her to strip, she firmly stands her ground. In the end, Diamond narrates that Ebony moved back to Tallahassee, FL to be with her mother. Blue is a top DJ at a radio station, and that he and Diamond are moving further in their relationship. Ronnie and Tricks got jobs at Club Sugar Daddy's after their release from jail. Junior is serving time in prison for raping Ebony, and that he never got married. Reggie and Clyde were last seen at the Freaknik in Atlanta. St. Louis is still "running the South" along with his hired guns, Brooklyn and KC. Peters and Freeman are still harassing people all day. Little Man is managing a different strip club in Chicago. Dollar Bill was never heard from again (Notwithstanding, it can be safely assumed that he was murdered by St. Louis' men for his debts as he was last seen being stuffed into the trunk of their car). Diana becomes a successful reporter, having put the past behind her to move on to a new life with her son and boyfriend.  
Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World
 In London, [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] is ambushed by a group of soldiers with a warrant for his arrest and presumed dead in the ensuing confrontation; [[John Ratcliffe (governor)|Governor Ratcliffe]] has lied to [[James VI and I|King James]] (being a personal friend of the King) and framed Smith as the traitor from the first film in a plot to declare war against the [[Powhatan]] Nation and get ahold of the gold he still believes them to possess, all while avoiding punishment for his own crimes. In order to prevent this, the King sends a young diplomat, [[John Rolfe]], to bring [[Chief Powhatan]] to England for negotiations. In the New World, [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]], Powhatan's daughter, mourns John Smith's death but is eventually able to move on. John Rolfe soon arrives, greeted by English civilians (who by now have settled in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]) and a curious Pocahontas. Rolfe eventually speaks with Powhatan, but he refuses to accompany him to England, so Pocahontas goes in her father's stead, believing that she can bring about peace between the two nations. Powhatan sends a bodyguard, Uttamatomakkin (Uti) to accompany Pocahontas. Rolfe and Pocahontas have a rocky start, but gradually warm up to each other.  In England, Rolfe leaves Pocahontas at his mansion and meets with King James and [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]], but James refuses to meet with Pocahontas despite Rolfe's pleas. Instead, per Ratcliffe's suggestion, James invites both Rolfe and Pocahontas to an upcoming ball and promises that if Pocahontas impresses him by acting "civilised", he will prevent the armada from sailing to Jamestown, but if she does not, he will declare war. Knowing that Ratcliffe deliberately manipulated the King, Rolfe and his maid, Mrs. Jenkins, educate Pocahontas in the ways of British etiquette to prepare her. At the ball, Pocahontas wins over the King and Queen with flattery and almost manages to prevent war, but a bear-baiting arranged by Ratcliffe and greatly enjoyed by the snobbish nobility infuriates Pocahontas and she openly accuses the King of savage behaviour. James angrily orders Pocahontas and Uti imprisoned in the Tower of London, and declares war on the Powhatan tribe.  At his home, a despondant Rolfe is approached by a hooded stranger who helps him break Pocahontas and Uti out of the tower and take them to an inn, where the man reveals himself to be John Smith. Smith implores Pocahontas to stay hidden with him, but she instead takes Rolfe's advice and decides to try and stop the war one last time. She openly confronts the King in the palace and reveals Smith, thus proving that Ratcliffe had been lying the entire time. Realising Ratcliffe's treachery, James sends a battalion to stop the armada. They are successful in stopping the ships before they can set sail, but Ratcliffe refuses to give up and tries to kill Pocahontas. Smith appears and fights Ratcliffe one-on-one until Ratcliffe draws a gun, but before he can fire, Rolfe sends him overboard with the ship's mast. Ratcliffe makes it back to the port, where he is arrested by the King.  Smith receives a royal pardon and his own ship from the King as a sign of apology. Pocahontas and Rolfe, meanwhile, appear on the verge of admitting that they love each other. Before they can, Smith appears and implores Pocahontas to accompany him on his new journeys around the world, but Pocahontas chooses otherwise and she and Smith part ways as friends. As Pocahontas later prepares to return to Jamestown, she finds Rolfe waiting for her on the ship, having chosen to go and live with her in Jamestown (with Uti remaining in London in his stead). They kiss as the ship sails into the sunset.

Fuji is revealed to be allying with Giovanni as a means to fund his side project: the resurrection of his deceased daughter Amber. In a laboratory, the weapon eventually gains sentience and is named [[Mewtwo]]. Mewtwo befriends the salvaged consciousness of Amber, named Ambertwo, as well as the clones of other Pokemon in the laboratory. However, Mewtwo is left deeply traumatized after Ambertwo and the rest of the clones decompose and die. In order to stabilize him, Fuji tranquilizes Mewtwo, causing him to [[amnesia|forget]] the time he spent with his friends.   ===''Mewtwo Strikes Back''=== After Mewtwo fully matures and awakens from a long slumber in a laboratory on New Island, he learns of his origin as Mew's clone from Dr. Fuji. Infuriated that Fuji and his colleagues see him as nothing more than an experiment, he unleashes his [[psychokinesis|psychic powers]] and destroys the laboratory. Giovanni, witnessing the carnage afar, approaches and convinces Mewtwo to work with him to hone his powers. However, after Mewtwo learns of his purpose to be a weapon for Giovanni's benefit, he escapes back to New Island where he plots revenge against humanity.   After Mewtwo rebuilds the laboratory and establishes base there, he invites several trainers with hologram messages to battle the world's greatest Pokémon trainer at New Island. Ash, Misty, and Brock receive a message and accept the invitation, but when they arrive at the port city, Old Shore Wharf, Mewtwo creates a storm, causing the boats on the wharf to be closed off for safety. As a result, Ash's group are picked up by [[Team Rocket (anime)#Team Rocket trio|Team Rocket]] disguised as Vikings on a boat. After the storm sinks their vessel in the middle of the ocean, Ash and his friends use their Pokémon instead to reach New Island.  Escorted into the island's palace by the woman who appeared on the hologram, Ash and the other trainers who were able to reach the island encounter Mewtwo. The woman is revealed to be a brainwashed [[List of Pokemon anime characters#Recurring characters|Nurse Joy]] after she is released from Mewtwo's mind control. After describing his plot to use the storm to wipe out humanity and Pokémon loyal to humans, Mewtwo challenges the trainers using cloned Pokémon coincidentally modeled after the deceased friends from his childhood. Meanwhile, Team Rocket also reach New Island and explore its inner sanctum with a Mew innocuously following them. After Mewtwo's clones effortlessly defeat the challengers' Pokémon, he confiscates them and expands his clone army. Ash chases after his captured Pikachu down the cloning lab, where Team Rocket's [[Meowth]] is also cloned. Ash destroys the cloning machine, frees the captured Pokémon, and leads them to confront Mewtwo and his clones. Mew then reveals itself and Mewtwo challenges it in order to prove his superiority.  All of the Pokémon originals battle their clones save for a defiant Pikachu and Meowth, who makes peace with his own clone after realizing the senselessness of their fighting. Horrified at the pain and anguish felt on both sides of the battle, Ash puts himself in between a psychic blast caused by Mewtwo and Mew's fighting, leading to Ash to become [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrified]]. Pikachu tries to revive Ash with its electricity but fails. However, the tears of the Pokémon, as per a legend mentioned earlier in the movie, are able to heal and revive Ash. Moved by Ash's sacrifice, Mewtwo realizes that he should not have to be judged by his origins but rather his choices in life. Departing with Mew and the clones, Mewtwo turns back time to just before the trainers leave Old Shore Wharf, and erases everyone's memories of the event.  Back in Old Shore Wharf, the now-restored Nurse Joy has returned to reopen the Pokémon Center to shelter the trainers. The storm outside clears up, Ash spotting Mew flying through the clouds and tells his friends of how he saw another [[Ho-Oh|legendary Pokémon]] the day he left Pallet Town. Meanwhile, Team Rocket find themselves stranded on New Island but enjoy their time there.

Gary begins to suspect Sally, so Gillian, Kylie and Antonia create a potion to banish Gary; however, the girls realize he is the one described in Sally's true love spell, and remove the potion. Later, Sally has Gary record her testimony and sees the letter she had once written Gillian, and realizes he must have read it more times than he had let on. Unable to deny their feelings for each other, they kiss and Sally realizes that he was there because of the spell she had cast years earlier.  Sally discovers that Jimmy's spirit has possessed Gillian's body and Gary sees Jimmy's spirit emerge. Jimmy attempts to kill Gary, reaching into his chest, only to be hurt by his silver star-shaped badge and is temporarily exiled. Later, Sally tells Gary that he is there because of her spell and the feelings they have for each other are not real.

He joins Stanton's inner circle of political advisers: Stanton's formidable wife, Susan Stanton ([[Emma Thompson]]); ruthless political strategist Richard Jemmons ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]); intelligent and attractive spokeswoman Daisy Green ([[Maura Tierney]]); and sly political operator Howard Ferguson ([[Paul Guilfoyle]]) as they journey to [[New Hampshire]], the first state to hold a [[New Hampshire primary|presidential primary]].      After Stanton completes an impressive debate performance against his Democratic rivals, Henry’s ex-girlfriend shows up to question Stanton about his arrest for an anti-war protest during the [[1968 Democratic Convention]] in Chicago. In addition it's revealed that Stanton called a U.S. senator to help him get released then Stanton persuaded the mayor of Chicago to have his police record expunged. The team becomes worried that Stanton’s past indiscretions may be used against him by the press and his political opponents. They hire Jack and Susan's old friend, tough but unbalanced Libby Holden ([[Kathy Bates]]), to investigate allegations that could be used by Stanton's political opponents to undermine his candidacy such as Stanton's notorious womanizing. One of Stanton's mistresses and Susan's hairdresser, Cashmere McLeod ([[Gia Carides]]), produces secret taped conversations between them to prove they had an affair. Henry discovers that the tapes have been doctored, so Libby tracks down the man responsible for the tapes and forces him at gunpoint to confess his guilt in a signed letter to the American public.  The campaign is then rocked by a fresh allegation when Stanton's old friend, "Big Willie" McCollister ([[Tommy Hollis]]) approaches Henry to tell him that his 17-year-old daughter Loretta (who worked for the Stantons as a babysitter) is pregnant and that Stanton is the father. Henry and Howard tell Willie he must allow his daughter to undergo an [[amniocentesis]] to determine paternity. Although they convince Willie to remain silent on the issue, Henry is nonetheless sickened and disillusioned with the experience.  Realizing the campaign is falling behind in the polls, Stanton's team adopt a new strategy. Stanton begins going on the offensive by attacking his nearest rival, Senator Lawrence Harris ([[Kevin Cooney]]) for casting anti-[[Israel]] votes and favoring cuts in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. Harris confronts Stanton during a radio talk show in Florida but suffers two heart attacks after the encounter. He suffers a medical setback, subsequently withdraws from the race, and is replaced by his friend, former Florida governor Fred Picker ([[Larry Hagman]]). Picker's wholesome, straight-talking image proves an immediate threat to the Stanton campaign.     Jack and Susan send Henry and Libby on an [[opposition research]] mission on Picker's past. They discover from his ex-brother-in-law, Eduardo Reyes ([[Tony Shalhoub]]), that Picker had a [[cocaine]] addiction as governor, which led to the disintegration of his first marriage. They also meet with Picker's cocaine supplier Lorenzo Delgado ([[John Vargas]]), with whom Picker had a [[homosexual]] affair. Not expecting the information to ever be used, Libby and Henry share their findings with Jack and Susan, but are dismayed when they both decide to leak the information to the press. Libby says that if Jack does so, she will reveal that he tampered with the results of the paternity test, proving that he slept with Willie's daughter. Libby commits suicide after she realizes she spent her life idealizing Jack and Susan only to learn how flawed they truly are. Racked with guilt over Libby's death, Stanton takes the incriminating information to Picker, and apologizes for seeking it out. Picker admits to his past indiscretions, and agrees to withdraw from the race and to endorse Stanton. Henry intends to quit the campaign, admitting he has become deeply disillusioned with the whole political process. Stanton begs Henry to reconsider, persuading him that the two of them can make history.  Months later, President Stanton is dancing at the Inaugural Ball with [[First Lady]], Susan. He shakes the hands of all his campaign staff, the last of whom is Henry.  
A Price Above Rubies
 The film tells the story of Sonia (Zellweger), a young [[Brooklyn]] woman who has just given birth to her first child. She is married, through an arranged marriage, to Mendel ([[Glenn Fitzgerald]]), a devout [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jew]] who is too immersed in his studies to give his wife the attention she craves. As a result, Sonia develops a relationship with Mendel's brother, the jeweler Sender (Eccleston), who brings her into the business. Sender is the only release for Sonia's repressed sexuality, and he takes full advantage of that fact as often as he can, but she is repelled by his utter lack of morals as she finds balance between what she feels and what she has been taught is "sinful". The jewellery business brings her into close contact with the young [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] artist and jewellery designer Ramon (Payne), but when Sender finds out about their connection he reveals it to the family, and Sonia is divorced and ostracized. The film ends on a more tolerance-friendly note, with Sonia balancing desire and every day life, and Mendel accepting her differences with a blessing and the promise to restore custody of their son.

 In 1941, Prime Minister of Japan [[Hideki Tojo]] orders an [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on the United States]], drawing that country into World War II. Four years later, [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrenders]], and a victorious United States and its [[Allies of World War II|allies]] begin to try Tojo and other members of the Japanese government for [[Japanese war crimes|war crime]]s.  The [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] is convened in 1946 and charges [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East#Defendants|28 individuals]] with Class-A war crimes. They are to be prosecuted by [[Joseph B. Keenan]] and tried in front of an international group of judges, including Justice [[William Webb (judge)|Sir William Webb]]. All twenty-eight plead not guilty, and Tojo charges the Americans with hypocrisy for trying him despite acts such as the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].  As the victors are the ones conducting the trials, Tojo and his co-defendants are unable to receive a fair trial, and some of the prosecutions' witnesses give [[perjury|false testimony]]. The verdict is ultimately delivered on 12 November 1948: Tojo, together with six of his co-defendants, is to be [[hanging|hanged]] for his role in the war. This sentence is carried out on 23 December 1948.  
The Prince of Egypt
  In [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Jochebed|Yocheved]] and her two young children, [[Miriam]] and [[Aaron]], watch as the newborn Hebrew boys are taken and ruthlessly killed as ordered by [[Seti I|Pharaoh Seti]], who fears that an alarming increase of Hebrew slaves could lead to [[rebellion]]. Fearing for her own newborn son's safety, Yocheved places him in a basket afloat on the [[Nile]] River, not before bidding him farewell with a final but powerful lullaby. Miriam follows the basket as it sails to the Pharaoh's palace and witnesses her baby brother safely adopted by Seti's wife [[Tuya (queen)|Queen Tuya]], who names him [[Moses]].  Years later, Moses and his adoptive brother [[Rameses II|Rameses]] are scolded by their father for accidentally destroying a [[Egyptian temple|temple]] during one of their youthful misadventures. At Moses' suggestion, Seti, seeking to give Rameses the opportunity to prove that he is a responsible young man, names him [[Prince Regent]] and gives him authority over Egypt's temples. As a tribute, the high priests [[Hotep]] and [[Huy (High Priest of Ptah)|Huy]] offer him a beautiful young [[Midian|Midianite]] woman, [[Zipporah|Tzipporah]], whom Rameses gives to Moses, appointing him Royal Chief [[Architect]].  Later that night, Moses follows Tzipporah as she escapes from the palace, and runs into the now-adult Miriam and Aaron, but he does not recognize them. Miriam then sings her mother's [[lullaby]], which Moses remembers; however, he returns to the palace, eager to go back to familiar surroundings. The truth about his past is later confirmed by a [[nightmare]], and finally by Seti himself, who disturbs Moses by claiming the Hebrews were "only slaves". The next day, Moses accidentally pushes an Egyptian guard to his death while trying to stop him from whipping an elderly Hebrew slave. Horrified and ashamed, Moses flees into the desert in [[exile]], despite Rameses' pleas that he stay.  While in the desert Moses defends three young girls from [[brigands]], only to find out their older sister is Tzipporah herself. Moses is welcomed by Tzipporah's father and the high priest of Midian, [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]. After assimilating into this new culture, Moses becomes a [[shepherd]] and marries Tzipporah. One day, while chasing a stray lamb, Moses discovers a [[burning bush]] through which God tells him to go back to Egypt and guide the Hebrew slaves to freedom. God bestows Moses' shepherding staff with his power and promises that he will tell Moses what to say. Moses and Tzipporah return to Egypt, where Moses is happily greeted by Rameses, who is now Pharaoh.  When Moses requests the Hebrews release and changes his staff into an [[Egyptian cobra]] to demonstrate his alliance with God, Hotep and Huy boastfully recreate this transformation, only to have their snakes eaten by Moses' snake. Rather than be persuaded, Rameses hardens and doubles the Hebrews workload. Moses inflicts nine of the [[Plagues of Egypt]], but still Rameses refuses to relent and, against Moses' warning (foreshadowing the final plague), vows never to release the Hebrews slaves. Disheartened, Moses prepares the Hebrews for the tenth and final plague, instructing them to sacrifice a lamb and mark the doorposts with the lamb's blood. That night, the final plague kills all the firstborn children of Egypt, including Rameses' son, while sparing those of the Hebrews. A grief-stricken Rameses finally gives Moses permission to free the Hebrews. After leaving the palace, Moses collapses weeping with grief, heartbroken at the pain he has caused his brother and Egypt.  The following morning, the Hebrews leave Egypt, led by Moses, Miriam, Aaron, and Tzipporah. At the [[Red Sea]], they discover that a vengeful Rameses is pursuing them with his army, intent on killing them. However, a writhing pillar of [[fire]] blocks the army's way, while Moses uses his staff to [[Crossing the Red Sea|part the sea]]. The Hebrews cross the open sea bottom; after that, the fire vanishes and the army gives chase, but the [[water]] closes over and drowns the Egyptian soldiers, sparing Rameses alone. Moses sadly bids farewell to his brother and leads the Hebrews to [[Mount Sinai]], where he receives the [[Ten Commandments]].  
The Prophecy II
 [[Lucifer]] (Guri Weinberg) ejects [[Archangel Gabriel|Gabriel]] from Hell, claiming the War of Heaven isn't his to fight and [[Hell]] isn't big enough for both of them. Gabriel's new mission is to prevent the birth of a child, a [[nephilim]], the offspring of an angel and a human. The coming of this child, said to precede reconciliation between the warring factions in heaven, has been prophesied by Thomas Daggett, now a monk. The child's conception takes place when Valerie, a nurse, is seduced by an attractive stranger (the [[angel]] Danyael) whom she hit with her car. She finds a few days later that she is pregnant.  Gabriel attempts to find the whereabouts of the child from Daggett, but kills him when he refuses to help. When Danyael kills members of Gabriel's army of angels, Gabriel instead employs the assistance of a teenage girl (Izzy) who has just committed suicide. Gabriel keeps her alive to help him in his search for Valerie (despite his powers as an angel, he is completely naive about technology, and is unable to drive a car or work a computer and has her use her computer skills to find her and drive him around).  Gabriel's war against Danyael and the other angels climaxes in a battle in Eden, now an industrial wasteland. Danyael and Izzy are killed, but Valerie defeats Gabriel by seizing him and jumping from a building, confident that God will protect her as He told her He would (she reveals that Gabriel is unable to hear His voice as he simply does not ''listen''); she is indeed unharmed, but Gabriel is impaled on a spike. As punishment, Gabriel is turned into a human by [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]]. Valerie raises the child by herself, accepting the risk that the angels may come for her. The film ends with Gabriel as a derelict; a face in the sky and ominous clouds show that the war in heaven is not over.

Psycho (1998 film)
 [[Marion Crane]] steals $400,000 from her employer to get her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, out of [[debt]]. She flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]], by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol trooper awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  Owner [[Norman Bates]] tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new [[interstate highway]] nearby and mentions he lives with his mother [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house; and, during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but he does not want to abandon her. Later that night, while Marion is changing, Norman secretly watches her from a peephole in his office and [[masturbate]]s before heading back to the house.  Marion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An unidentified female figure, presumed to be Norman's mother, enters the bathroom and stabs Marion to death with a [[Chef's knife|chef’s knife]]. Later, finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions—including the money—in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.  Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister, [[Lila Crane|Lila]], and private detective Milton Arbogast, who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who lies unconvincingly that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again in an hour after he questions Norman's mother.  Arbogast enters Norman's house and, at the top of the stairs, is attacked and murdered by the Mother figure. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers is perplexed to hear that Arbogast saw a woman in a window, as Mrs. Bates had been dead for ten years. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but Norman carries her to the cellar against her will.  Posing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search the room Marion had occupied. They find a scrap of paper in the toilet with "$400,000" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila. But Sam, having regained consciousness, subdues him with Lila's help.  After Norman's arrest, [[Forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Simon Richmond tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, his mother found a lover. Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is Mother, he acts, talks and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so Mother kills any woman for whom Norman has feelings. When Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime and covers up for her. Richmond concludes that the Mother personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind, erasing his existence.  In the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in Mother's voice. In a voice-over, Mother explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. Marion's car is shown being recovered from the swamp and is followed by the ending credits.  To reflect [[currency inflation|inflation]] the monetary figures were altered from the original film; the amount of money stolen, $400,000 ($ inflation-adjusted), was $40,000 ($ inflation-adjusted) in the 1960 original.<ref name=Vern></ref>

Quest for Camelot
 [[Sir Lionel]] is one of the [[Round Table|knights of the Round Table]], and his daughter Kayley wants to be a [[knight]] like her father. At [[Camelot]], one of the knights, Ruber - wanting to overthrow [[King Arthur]] - attempts to kill him, but Lionel intervenes and is killed. Ruber flees Camelot in exile after being rebounded by Arthur's sword [[Excalibur]]. During Lionel's funeral, Arthur tells Kayley and her mother, Juliana, that they will be welcomed should they come to Camelot.  A decade later, a [[griffin]] attacks Camelot, stealing Excalibur. [[Merlin]]'s [[falcon]] Ayden attacks the griffin and the sword falls into the Forbidden Forest. Meanwhile, Ruber invades Kayley's home, holds everyone hostage and uses a potion he obtained from [[Witchcraft|witches]] to create steel warriors from his human henchmen and a [[rooster]], who becomes known as Bladebeak. He plans to use Juliana to gain entrance into Camelot.  After escaping and eavesdropping on Ruber and the Griffin's conversation, Kayley enters the Forbidden Forest where she encounters Garrett; a [[Visual impairment|blind]] [[hermit]], and Ayden. Kayley convinces him to help her find Excalibur and learns that Garrett was once a stable boy in Camelot, and was blinded by one of the horses that he was rescuing from a stable fire. Lionel still believed in Garrett, and taught him to adapt.  They enter [[Dragon]] Country and meet a comical [[Polycephaly|two-headed dragon]] named Devon and Cornwall who do not like each other, cannot breathe fire or fly (the reason they are bullied by other dragons), and want to be two individual dragons instead of one two-headed dragon. Devon and Cornwall decide to join to the group; Garrett reluctantly agrees after Kayley manages to convince him.  Later, they found the belt of Excalibur in a giant footprint. Kayley's insistence of questioning Garrett causes him to miss Ayden's signal and is injured by one of Ruber's men. Kayley drags Garrett away as the thorn bushed [[Legendary creature|creature]]s hold Ruber and his men captive, and escorts him into a small cave where the magic of the forest heals Garrett's wounds. While they are in the cave, Kayley and Garrett have a connection. The group goes into a giant cave where it lives an [[ogre]] who holds Excalibur; currently using it as a toothpick. Kayley succeeds in getting Excalibur and they escape before Ruber can get to it.  Exiting the forest with Excalibur, Garrett stays behind, feeling unwanted in Camelot. After he leaves, Ruber captures Kayley and takes Excalibur. Devon and Cornwall, who witnessed this, rush to Garrett convincing him to go save Kayley. By working together for the first time, Devon and Cornwall are able to fly and breathe fire. Meanwhile, Kayley is held captive in one of the wagons; Bladebeak releases Kayley from her ropes and Garrett comes to her aid and they enter the castle.  Inside, they find Ruber attempting to kill Arthur with Excalibur; now bonded to his arm. Kayley and Garrett intervene and trick Ruber into returning Excalibur to its stone, causing its magic to disintegrate Ruber and revert the mechanical men, including Bladebeak, back to normal. Later, with Camelot restored to its former glory, Kayley and Garrett become knights of the round table.  
The Quiet Family
 An extended family has moved from the city (presumably Seoul) to live in a large house out in the mountains, which they convert into a lodge for hikers. Consisting of a middle aged father Kang Dae-goo ([[Park In-hwan (actor)|Park In-hwan]]), mother Jeong Soon-rye ([[Na Moon-hee]]), Dae-goo's younger brother Kang Chang-goo ([[Choi Min-sik]]), and their adult children Kang Young-min ([[Song Kang-ho]]), Kang Mi-soo (Lee Yoon-seong) and Kang Mina (Go Ho-kyung) they suffer a string of misfortunes as various patrons come to stay.  Their first guest, a hiker, asks for a room and three beers. Left to himself, he spends the night forging his room key holder to be sharp enough to stab himself and is found dead the next morning. The father of the family decides on burying the body in the woods, under the assumption that no one would believe this to be a suicide. Later, a young couple drops in for a stay to have sex in the privacy of their room and end up dead together the next morning. A pair of friends from town stop by for drinks until one of the men falls for Mi-soo and subsequently attempts to rape her, but she is saved by Young-min, who accidentally ends up pushing the man off a cliff, while his friend is taken captive by the family to prevent him from calling the police.  Mr. Park, the benefactor of the family (providing them the house) later asks for their lodging for his younger (and illegitimate) half sister to have a hitman check into the neighboring room at midnight and murder her so he can be the only successor to the claim inheritance of the soon profitable land. Uninformed of the plan, Uncle Kang senses foul play and sends the half sister home to Seoul when she is found to be restless. The plan goes further awry when the hitman arrives fifteen minutes late, and the room had been taken by an undercover cop investigating the recent string of missing people, mistaken to be the hitman. The hitman thus ends up killing the cop instead, and is later killed by a suspicious Young-min.  A heavy rainstorm overnight nearly uncovers the buried corpses by morning, leaving the family no choice but to incinerate them.  When uncle returns from the trip to Seoul, he angers Dae-goo who had hoped to settle Mr. Park's plot without any trouble. A fight ensues as uncle is beaten senseless but is saved from a blow to the head by Young-min who then trips, hitting his head on the stairs, he is whisked to the hospital, leaving the elderly parents the only ones left to finish the job. The local man, having been imprisoned, bound and gagged, tries to make his escape but gets his ropes tangled in several trees as he escapes the lodge.  Soon enough, Mr. Park drops in unannounced to check if his sister-in-law has been terminated as planned, but is in complete shock when he sees Mr. Kang and Mrs. Jeong carrying the corpse of the undercover cop, knowing that he wasn't the hitman. A brief struggle begins when Mr. Park tries to escape without trying to figure out just what exactly has happened, and ends after he accidentally falls to his death down the stairs, adding yet another body to be done away with for the family.  To drive away attention, Mrs. Jeong switches off the circuits throughout the lodge and outside storage where she and her husband are piling the corpses, dousing them in gasoline. Mina, trying to watch TV, asks for Uncle Kang to switch the circuits back on, inadvertently causing a socket in the storage to burst in flames, triggering the cremation fire prematurely, trapping the parents inside. Meanwhile, Young-min is in the hospital recovering from his concussion and laughing insanely over a news report on the shooting of a North Korean agent wandering through the forest.  After an uncertain amount of time later, Uncle Kang, Young-min, Mi-soo, and Mina are preparing to serve dinner, totally unaware of the fire in the storage building. The parents return, in bandages, having survived the fire. Without a single word, the family quietly has dinner until there is a sudden knock at the door. Unsure of what to do, they all stand quietly in the doorway of the dining room, waiting for whoever is at the door to go away. When the dog starts barking at the knocking, the family, in unison hushes the dog; they have become the quiet family.  The film ends with a wide shot of the lodge in winter, with Mina outside, looking at it, and then to the camera with an uncertain look on her face; all to the sound of [[The Partridge Family]]'s "[[I Think I Love You]]".

 A political story set in the pre-independent India when [[Communism in Kerala|Communism]] came into picture.  
Rabid Dogs
 Four criminals rob an armored truck carrying the wages of a pharmaceutical company, but during their getaway their car is damaged and one of them is killed. The remaining three criminals, Doc (Maurice Poli), Blade (Aldo Caponi) and Thirty-Two (Luigi Montefiori) are forced to flee on foot into an underground car park, pursued by the police. The criminals grab two women as hostages, and when Blade accidentally kills one, the police, seeing the other hostage Maria (Lea Lander) in danger, back away, allowing the criminals to steal her car and escape. Doc knows that its only a matter of time before a description of their new getaway car reaches the authorities, so they hijack another car at gunpoint. The middle-aged driver of this car, Riccardo (Riccardo Cucciolla), protests that he has to get his young child – a small, deathly-pale little boy wrapped up in a blanket – to a hospital, but the criminals force Riccardo to drive them out of the city towards their hideout.  During most the long road journey, Maria cannot stop herself from shaking and quaking with fear, which annoys Blade and Thirty-Two. Riccardo on the other hand takes what's happening to him very calmly. Blade and Thirty-Two frequently fondle Maria who continues to tremble constantly, and Doc is barely able to keep them in line. At a traffic construction site, Doc forces the group to roll their windows up, which attracts some attention because it is the middle of a hot summer day. But Doc has them roll their windows back down, and the group continues on. A little later, Maria asks Doc to pull the car over so she can relieve herself, then tries to escape. Blade and Thirty-Two chase her to an unoccupied farmhouse, recapture her, and then force her to urinate in front of them as punishment.  Back on another ''autostrade'', Riccardo asks Doc if can pull into a rest stop for food and supplies. With Thirty-Two accompanying him, Riccardo buys some sandwiches and soda pop, while Thirty-Two buys a bottle of scotch. When a random woman at the rest area recognizes Riccardo, he manages to shake her off by saying that he's going on a picnic in the countryside with some friends.  Back on the expressway, Thirty-Two becomes intoxicated from the bottle of liquor he bought, and his actions begin to draw attention from other motorists. Doc and Blade try to control him, but he gets more and more out of control, and he attempts to rape Maria. Rather than risk attracting the attention of the highway police, Doc shoots Thirty-Two in the neck. Blade is completely shaken by this, but understands that Doc had no other choice. Thirty-Two does not die, but becomes completely helpless and immobile.  Soon after this incident, Riccardo tells them that they need to stop for gas. However, when they finally reach a rural [[Esso]] filling station, the elderly attendant (Francesco Ferrini) tells them that he's on his hour break and won't help them for at least another 20 minutes. Doc, in a hurry to complete their journey, attempts to threaten the old man, who instead pulls a gun on Doc telling them that he was robbed the previous year and cannot be intimidated. Blade forces Maria to smooth things over by pleading with the attendant to come out and fill their car so they can get the comatose little boy to a hospital. The old man relents, but another complication arises when an overly cheerful young woman (Eriak Dario) shows up at the station claiming that her car had broken down and that she needs assistance. Seeing the group, she pressures Doc into giving her a ride to the next town. When the woman opens the side door to the car, Thirty-Two's hand, covered with his own blood, slumps into view. The woman fails to see this, but the attendant does. Rather than risk a scene, Doc allows the woman to come along with them. The old man returns to his office with a shrug.  The hitchhiker, also named Maria, talks constantly, which annoys everyone. She is also completely oblivious to the situation. When she inadvertently removes the blanket covering Thirty-Two's neck, revealing the bullet wound, Blade kills her. Doc forces Riccardo to pull over so they can dispose of the body. They also carry the still-breathing Thirty-Two out of the car, and Blade shoots his mortally wounded friend to put him out of his misery.  The group finally reaches the gang's hideout: a ruined villa just south of Naples where Doc has stashed a back-up car, carrying the appropriate papers that will enable him and Blade to leave the country. Riccardo and Maria are elated, but Doc reveals that he intends to kill hostages to secure their escape. Riccardo tries to persuade Doc to let the little boy, who has been in a sedative-induced sleep for the whole duration, live. But Doc refuses and orders Riccardo to remove the little boy from the car. As Riccardo does so, he pulls out a gun hidden all this time in the child's blanket and shoots both Doc and Blade, who fatally injures Maria with his machine gun before expiring. With the tires of the car flat from the bullet hits, Riccardo moves the child to Doc's getaway car, takes the stolen money, and drives off.  In a final twist, it is revealed that Riccardo, too, has a dark secret of his own: he is really a criminal who kidnapped the young child from its real parents and he phones the child's mother in the final scene to tell her to pay a ransom of six million lire and he will call back to give further instructions. Riccardo returns to his new car containing the child in the trunk and drives away.

Rasen
 Following the events of ''Ring'', the body of [[List of Ring characters#Ryuji Takayama|Ryūji Takayama]], former husband of [[Reiko Asakawa]] and father of [[List of Ring characters#Yoichi Asakawa|Yōichi Asakawa]], is examined by his friend and rival, [[Forensic pathology|pathologist]] Mitsuo Andō. After he finds a cryptic note in Takayama's stomach, Reiko and Yōichi also turn up dead. Andō soon learns of a mysterious [[curse]]d videotape, haunted by the spirit of a murdered young woman. Rumor has it that anyone who watches the video will die exactly one week later. Despondent over the death of his own child, and believing that he is being guided by his rival's ghost, Andō decides to see the video for himself. After watching the tape, strange things begin to happen around him, and he soon discovers that the tape's restless spirit has different plans in store for him.  With the help of Takayama's student, Mai Takano, Andō finds out more about Ryūji's past as well as the mysterious young woman, [[Sadako Yamamura]]. Searching for the truth about why Ryūji and Yōichi died from the virus while Reiko didn't leads him to her boss Yoshino. Yoshino lets Andō in on a secret: he has the wife's diary. She and Ryūji had been researching the cursed videotape. While Reiko had broken the curse, Ryūji died a week after watching the tape. Reiko believed that creating a copy would break the curse but Yōichi died a week after watching the tape, just as his father had. Yoshino shows Andō both the tape and the diary.  When Andō tells Mai Takano what he's done, she is shocked and can't understand why, since she felt from the start that it was the video that killed Takayama and his family. As they are talking, Yoshino calls Andō. He admits that he wishes he'd never been involved in Reiko's business. Andō believes that Yoshino had watched the video, but he denies it saying that he was too scared to. However, Yoshino still dies.  Andō decides to destroy the videotapes and make sure that he will be the video's last victim. He then confides in Mai about his son's death, and they end up sleeping together. Andō asks Mai if she'll be there with him when he dies, but Mai tells him she's too scared. He understands and decides to try to find out more about the virus that killed Takayama and his son. He discovers that the virus that killed Yoshino was different from the one that killed the father and son. Andō asks for tests to be run on him.  Meanwhile, Mai Takano goes missing and Andō apparently survives the curse. He starts to feel that the story was just a myth and he's relieved when Mai turns up. However, he is shocked to find out that she has been found dead, having given birth with no sign of a baby. Andō goes back to work and sees "Mai" there and finds out that she is none other than Sadako Yamamura, reborn and claiming to be "perfectly dual-gendered". He then learns that Takayama wasn't helping Andō stop Sadako – instead, he was helping Sadako. Yoshino, Andō's friend Miyashita and many others weren't killed by a virus or the video but rather Reiko's diary. Sadako promises to help resurrect Andō's son in exchange for his help.  In the end, Andō brings Takayama and his son back to life with help from Sadako. Just as Ryūji leaves, he tells Andō "Many years will pass before our world will be at peace."  
Rebirth of Mothra III
  Moll, Lora, and Belvera, the Elias sisters, are at odds again. Belvera seeks the secret power of their ancestors, tiny triangular power units that transform the sisters' small daggers into powerful swords. She steals the three units from Infant Island but is thwarted by Fairy Mothra, Moll and Lora's pet, and fails to retrieve the proper triangle for her sword (each power unit will only work for a specific sword).  Moll and Lora end up with a unit that transforms Moll's sword.  Shortly after the Elias sisters faceoff, a meteor shower brings to Earth a huge meteor that disrupts gravity near it at night, as a family watches. The next day, the oldest of the children, a teenage boy called Shota, plays hookey from school, and goes to investigate the object. Meanwhile, school children on playgrounds and around the nearby city begin to mysteriously vanish as a huge shadow passes overhead. Moll and Lora examine the remains of the crashed meteor, discovering the essence of dinosaurs, and realizes that a great evil has been released. [[King Ghidorah]], a three-headed space monster who visited Earth in its past and is thought to be responsible for the destruction of the dinosaurs, returns with the captured children to a secluded spot near where the meteor crashed, trapping them in a huge, pulsating organic dome. Thankfully, at Moll and Lora's calling, Rainbow Mothra arrives and begins to battle King Ghidorah, but the three headed demon's ancient powers render all of Mothra's attacks useless and the King of Terror proceeds to easily dominate Rainbow Mothra, who only just escapes.  Later, Moll and Lora encounter Ghidorah, who infects Lora with its evil by staring into Lora's eyes. Under Ghidorah's spell, Lora attacks Moll and attempts to drag them both into the dome.  However, [[Mothra|Fairy Mothra]] flies down towards the dome and saves Moll before she falls into it.  Belvera, intrigued by Ghidorah's arrival, gets too close to the dome and is dragged inside with her pet henchman, Garu-Garu, by little serpent beings.  The monster then wreaks havoc in the city.  Meanwhile, Moll and Fairy Mothra encounter Shota, who has discovered that his brother Shuehei and sister Tamako are among the many children trapped inside the dome.  Moll tells Shota about Ghidorah's plan to use the children's life force to feed upon. She convinces him to accompany her and meet their only hope, the recovering Rainbow Mothra. Moll and Rainbow Mothra communicate telepathically, discussing their options. It is agreed that Rainbow Mothra cannot defeat Ghidorah in its current form and so it is decided that he must travel to a time when the dinosaurs still walked the Earth, and when the three-headed dragon had visited from space for the first time, then less powerful, to feed upon the Earth's life-force. Rainbow Mothra turns into Aqua Mothra and, with Moll giving the creature all of her powers, the massive insect turns into Light Speed Mothra and breaks through the boundaries of time and travel to confront Ghidorah, some 65 million years in the past.   Moll gives Shota her sword and asks him to go inside the dome to find Lora, and to convince her to use her powers to help Mothra.  After Shota reluctantly agrees, Moll languishes and, with her powers totally depleted from helping Mothra time-travel, falls into a state of suspended animation, her body taking on the appearance of frosted glass. Shota allows Ghidorah to capture him so he can find Lora in the dome.  There, Lora encounters a worried Belvera, who tells her that Ghidorah plans to destroy the Earth.  Lora takes the triangular unit that Belvera had and uses it to transform her sword.  Still under Ghidorah's spell, the two fairies engage in a sword fight, with Belvera begging Lora to see reason and to work with her, but to no avail. Shota finds Lora, but she attacks him and attempts to stab him with her sword.  Belvera warns Lora not to do it as Shota reminds her that she loves children deeply.  Soon, Ghidorah's spell breaks and Lora falls into Shota's hands, her sword then combining with Moll's.  Belvera finally realizes that the Elias triangle represents the three of them, uses the last remaining triangular unit to transform her sword, and then combines her sword with both Lora's and Moll's.  Using the new superpower sword, she attempts to break open the dome as Lora recovers.  Light Speed Mothra appears in the Age of Dinosaurs and turns back into Rainbow Mothra. Another fight between her and Ghidorah takes place. After originally holding the advantage, Rainbow Mothra is badly wounded.  The dome shakes violently and realizing that Rainbow Mothra is losing the battle, Shota asks Lora to use her powers to help the creature.  As Lora sings, Rainbow Mothra energizes and manages to immobilize Ghidorah long enough to pick it up and drop it into a nearby volcano, but not before a severed piece of Ghidorah's tail burrows itself into the ground. The volcano erupts with Ghidorah in it, destroying the monster.  Rainbow Mothra is hurled out of the exploding volcano, crashes to the ground and dies.  Back in the present time, Ghidorah and the dome disappear, freeing the children and the fairies.  Shota reunites with Shuehei and Tamako and they join Belvera and Lora as they sadly kneel by the body of Moll, unsure how they can save her. Back in the past, three Primitive Mothra larvae arrive and wrap the body of Rainbow Mothra in a time-capsule cocoon.  Back in the present, Belvera expresses concern to Lora, noting that if Ghidorah is really destroyed, the current course of events would have changed.  Suddenly, Ghidorah appears in the sky amidst a massive fireball. This is the other Ghidorah which grew from the severed tail of the creature killed by Rainbow Mothra in the past. The new Ghidorah starts to capture children again.  Meanwhile, Belvera convinces Lora to join her in battle, and the two distracts Ghidorah with Fairy Mothra.  Suddenly, the time-capsule cocoon explodes from a mountain and Rainbow Mothra emerges, this time as Armor Mothra, a formidable version with armour plating all over it.  Another battle takes place, and this time, Ghidorah is no match for his opponent, who slices Ghidorah's wing off and then disintegrates the monster.  Armor Mothra then communicates with Belvera and Lora, telling them to join their powers and, using the sword, to bring Moll back to life.  The fairies do as they are told and, as a result, the sword vanishes and Moll revives, as Lora and Belvera smile.  The touching reunion between the three sisters is short-lived, as Belvera calls for Garu-Garu and flies off.  All the children are released once again and reunited with their parents.  Shota, Shuehei, Tamako and their parents watch as Moll and Lora ride away with Fairy Mothra, and Armor Mothra, now transformed as Eternal Mothra, flies into the sunset.

The Red Violin
 [[File:Jean Dodal Tarot trump 18.jpg|thumbnail|100px|left|[[The Moon (Tarot card)|The Moon]] tarot card]] '''Cremona, 1681''' ''(<small>Language: Italian</small>)'' Nicolò Bussotti is a [[Luthier|violin-maker]] whose wife, Anna Rudolfi, is pregnant. Anna asks her servant Cesca to foretell her unborn child's future. Cesca cannot determine the future of someone not born, but she does offer to read Anna's future using [[tarot]] cards. The first, [[The Moon (Tarot card)|The Moon]], signifies that Anna will live a long life.  In the meantime, Nicolò has fashioned a new violin. He is about to [[Varnish#Violin|varnish]] it when he finds that both she and the child have died. Distraught, Nicolò returns to his shop and begins to varnish the violin. The violin then makes its way to an [[orphanage]] in Austria.  [[File:Jean Dodal Tarot trump 12.jpg|thumbnail|100px|left|[[The Hanged Man (tarot card)|The Hanged Man]] tarot card]] '''Vienna, 1793''' ''(<small>Language: German and French</small>)''  Cesca turns over the second card, [[The Hanged Man (tarot card)|The Hanged Man]], which means disease and suffering for those around Anna.  At the orphanage, the violin comes into the possession of Kaspar Weiss, a young but brilliant violin [[child prodigy|prodigy]]. The monks at the orphanage ask a violin instructor, Poussin, to adopt the boy to further his development. Poussin brings Weiss and the violin to [[Vienna]]. They learn that Prince Mannsfeld is visiting Vienna and is looking for a prodigy to accompany him back to [[Prussia]], promising a generous reward. Poussin puts Weiss through a strict practice regimen. However, the regimens and "Poussin Meter" (a primitive [[metronome]]) take a toll on Weiss' [[heart defect]]. On the day of the recital, as he starts playing, Weiss's heart gives out from the stress and he collapses, dead.  Weiss is buried at the orphanage he grew up in. When Poussin inquires about the violin, the monks explain that they buried it with Weiss. The violin is later stolen by [[grave robbers]] travelling in a [[Romani people|gypsy]] procession, who take it to England.  '''Oxford, late 1890s''' ''(<small>Language: English and [[Romani language|Romani]]</small>)'' [[File:Jean Dodal Tarot trump 15.jpg|thumbnail|100px|right|[[The Devil (Tarot card)|The Devil]] tarot card]] Cesca's third card is [[The Devil (Tarot card)|The Devil]] and she explains that Anna will meet a handsome and intelligent man that will seduce her.  Frederick Pope comes across the gypsy procession setting up camp on his estate, as a gypsy woman plays the violin. He offers his hospitality in exchange for the violin. Frederick finds great praise in his public concerts with the violin as well as his compositions, with his lover Victoria Byrd serving as his carnal [[muse]]. Victoria, a writer, announces to Frederick that she needs to travel to [[Russia]] to research a novel she is working on.  While Victoria is absent, Frederick loses his inspiration to compose and degenerates. When Victoria does not receive his letters for a full week, she resolves to return immediately. But when she arrives, she finds him in the arms of a new muse, the violinist gypsy woman. In a moment of rage, Victoria shoots the violin, grazing its neck and detaching its strings and [[tailpiece]], before storming out.  Frederick's final letter to Victoria states that he will be committing suicide and that he is leaving his entire estate to her. The violin ends up in the hands of Frederick's Chinese servant, who returns to [[Shanghai]] and sells it to an antiques dealer, who repairs the damage. The instrument is sold to a young woman with her daughter during the 1930s.  [[File:Jean Dodal Tarot trump 08.jpg|thumbnail|100px|left|[[Justice (Tarot card)|Justice]] tarot card]] '''Shanghai, late 1960s''' ''(<small>Language: Mandarin</small>)''  Cesca predicts the fourth card, [[Justice (Tarot card)|Justice]], means tough times ahead, featuring a trial and persecution, where Anna shall be guilty.  In the chaos of China's [[Cultural Revolution]], any ideas or items deemed "bourgeois" are denounced and should be destroyed. One target for public denunciation and [[Self-criticism#In Communist movements|self-criticism]] is a music teacher named Zhou Yuan, who is berated for his fondness for [[classical music|Western classical music]]. A [[Political officer (military)|political officer]], Xiang Pei, successfully defends Zhou. Xiang then returns to her residence and retrieves the Red Violin, given as a gift from her mother. Several [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] raid Xiang's apartment after learning of its existence, finding nothing.  Xiang arrives at Zhou's house and pleads with him to take the violin to keep it safe. He relents and vows to keep it hidden, while Xiang leaves to face possible prosecution from Communist Party officials. Years later, Chinese police enter Zhou's home to find his dead body amid a "sanctuary" of dozens of musical instruments. Upon this discovery, the present-day [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] ships these items to [[Montreal]] for appraisal and sale at auction.

Morritz arrives in Montreal as an [[appraiser]] for the violins sent by the Chinese government. Almost immediately, he notices the Red Violin and believes it may be the legendary last violin of Nicolò Bussotti. He has restorer Evan Williams perform some work on it, while sending samples of the varnish to a lab at the [[University of Montreal]]. At the same time, he purchases a copy of the Red Violin from a private collection in London, the closest copy to the original available.  When the results of the varnish tests arrive, Morritz is shocked to learn that the violin's varnish contains human blood. Nicolò had carried his wife's body to his shop after her death and slit her wrist to collect blood for making the red paint. He admits to the auction manager, Leroux, that he has the Red Violin.  As he prepares to fly home, Morritz stops by the auction house "Duval's", with the London copy in hand. As the auction for the previous lot ends, Morritz switches the Red Violin for the London copy, which is sold for $2.4 million. Morritz calls his wife at home in New York City and asks to speak to his daughter, telling her he has a special present for her upon his return.  
The Replacement Killers
 During an orchestrated drug bust at a marine loading dock, Detective Stan Zedkov ([[Michael Rooker]]) kills [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]] lieutenant Peter Wei (Yau-Gene Chan). Looking to exact revenge for his son's death, crime boss Terence Wei ([[Kenneth Tsang]]) sends for professional assassin John Lee ([[Chow Yun-fat]]). Paying off an old debt, Lee has already killed two targets for Wei, and the crime boss tells him that this third and final job will settle the obligation. However, Lee's conscience prevents him from completing his final assignment: to murder Zedkov's seven-year-old son Stevie (Andrew J. Marton) before the detective's eyes. Realizing that his actions will result in retaliation against his mother and sister, Lee prepares to return to China, enlisting the help of old friend Alan Chan, a monk in a local Buddhist temple, to make arrangements to have his family moved to a secure location. Infuriated by Lee's disobedience, Wei orders his head lieutenant, Michael Kogan ([[Jürgen Prochnow]]), to lead the hunt for Lee, and has his people in China begin the search for Lee's family.  No longer able to use the Triad network to get out of the country, Lee searches for alternative means outside Wei's sphere of influence, and looks to skilled forger Meg Coburn ([[Mira Sorvino]]) for a new passport. Before she can finish the job, Wei's men storm her office, destroying the computerized tools of her trade in the ensuing shootout. Lee escapes; Coburn is picked up by the police, unsuccessfully interrogated by Zedkov, and released as bait so the detective can see who comes after her. Meanwhile, Wei hires skilled out-of-town replacement killers to take over the hunt for Lee and the Zedkov contract.  Lee finds Coburn when she returns to her destroyed office. Having been made aware that the Triads are involved, Coburn wants out, but Lee forces her to finish her original task of creating a forged passport. Traveling with Coburn, with the two replacement killers, Ryker ([[Til Schweiger]]) and Collins ([[Danny Trejo]]), in pursuit, Lee gets pictures from a photo booth and phones Alan, who offers the use of his passport. When Lee arrives at the temple, he discovers that Alan has been tortured to the point of death. Alan tells Lee that his family was moved to [[Guangzhou|Canton]]—but he told his torturers they were in Shanghai.<ref name="film"/> Lee has little more than 24 hours before his family is found. The monk gives Lee his passport before dying in his arms.  Holed up in a hotel, Coburn finishes altering Allan's passport for Lee. The two exchange stories, and Coburn becomes sympathetic to Lee. Feeling compelled to stop the killing of Zedkov's son before leaving the country, Lee forces one of Wei's men to reveal the plan, which is to kill Stevie while he and his father are at a cartoon festival in a movie theater. Lee and Coburn, who insists on helping, arrive barely in time to prevent Ryker and Collins from killing the boy, and Ryker is killed in the subsequent gunfight. Concerned that Lee and Coburn will make their way back to Wei's base of operations, the crime boss makes plans to flee the country and hunt down Lee's mother and sister himself. However, when two guards open the main gate for Wei and his entourage to leave in a limo, Lee is just outside and launches a two-handed handgun assault. Coburn surfaces moments later, driving a truck through the melee, incapacitating Wei's Kogan, and later killing him. When Collins fires from a high perch on Lee and Coburn, Lee soon outflanks him, killing him from behind. Finally, Lee corners Wei on a fire escape platform. Though both men have emptied their guns, Lee is first to reload. Wei promises Lee that the boy and Lee's family will still die, but Lee replies, "Not in your lifetime," and kills him. Though Zedkov arrives before Lee and Coburn can get away, he lets them go, taking only their guns. Coburn reluctantly bids goodbye to Lee at the airport, presenting him with one last gift, passports for his mother and sister.<ref name="film"/>

After stumbling upon Tomoko's photos from the past week, Reiko finds that the four teenagers stayed in a rental cabin in Izu.  Reiko goes to Izu and arrives at the rented cabin, where she finds an unlabeled tape in the cabin's reception room. Watching the tape, Reiko sees a series of seemingly unrelated disturbing images. As soon as the tape is over, Reiko sees a mysterious reflection in the television and receives a phone call containing the screeching sounds from the tape. Disturbed, she flees the cabin.

Richie Rich's Christmas Wish
 It's [[Christmas Eve]] and [[Richie Rich (comics)|Richie Rich]], the world's richest kid, is all excited to spend the day with his friends. While racing wildly with his friends in the snow, Richie's butler, [[Herbert Cadbury]], controls the cars using a remote and guides the children back to Richie's house. He then reminds him about his responsibilities that are due to be executed on Christmas Eve, and instructs him to change his clothes and get ready for tea. Before going to do so, he visits his home scientist, Professor Keanbean, who shows him his recent invention, a wishing machine which works only on Christmas Eve. The day being that, Richie wishes for a "big pie" from it, and is given a "pig sty" instead. Cadbury is disgusted seeing this, and sends him off to change his clothes. He meets his parents, Richard and Regina Rich, to ask what they would like to have for Christmas. While with them, he also tries out his father's new fishing rod invented by Keanbean, which hooks on to a [[tuna sandwich]] in the vicinity. He then goes on to change his clothes.  During tea, Richie meets his spoiled cousin, Reggie Van Dough, who wishes that he was as rich as Richie. Later, he dresses up like an [[elf]] with Cadbury as [[Santa Claus]] to distribute Christmas presents to the orphanage. While getting ready, Cadbury tells Richie about how he was a rock star in his youth days, in a band called [[Root Canal]]. When they take off in the sleigh with Richie driving it, Reggie takes control of it using a remote invented by Keanbean. He guides it through streets by shops, houses, and people, thus nearly destroying everything in the whole process. Richie and Cadbury end up in an accident in which the sleigh falls and literally explodes along with the presents, while Cadbury hurts his ankle badly. Richie runs off to fetch help, but once he enters the city, he sees that the situation has changed dramatically. Reggie is cooking up rumors about him, and all the people have turned against him.   Devastated, Richie goes into Keanbean's laboratory and squats in front of the wishing machine. While fretting over his ill luck, he accidentally wishes that he was never born. The machine at once grants his wish, following which he is transported to another world in which he was never born and hence nobody recognizes him. Reggie has taken over as Richard and Regina's son, and is now the richest kid in the world. He bosses around everyone. Roads and buildings are named after him. This world is very sad, and hunger and misery are seen all over. This makes Richie realize that things would not be better if he was not born, and hence decides to go back to the world in which he is Richie Rich.   Though his parents do not recognize him anymore, he is happy that his dog, Dollar, does. He takes Dollar with him, only to enrage Reggie, who is his current owner. Reggie orders policemen to search for Richie, who is falsely called the "dognapper", and also announces a reward for catching him. After outsmarting various policemen who try but fail to catch him, Richie finds Cadbury, who is still part of Root Canal, and Keanbean, who runs his own laboratory called "Keanbean's World of Wonders". Richie questions Keanbean about the wishing machine, which he says, requires a ''Pegliasaurus'' wishing bone in order to be complete. Along with his friends who decide to help him, Richie goes to the city museum to retrieve the bone from the dinosaur skeleton. After passing through laser detection systems successfully, they get it, using the fishing rod invented by Keanbean. Before they get out of the museum, Richie and his friends spot Reggie's parents, who are now working as night guards there.   Once they reach the lab, they get the machine to work properly. However, before Richie could wish himself back, Reggie arrives there with the policemen. Richie, Cadbury, Keanbean, and Richie's friends are put in jail, while Reggie takes the machine home. At home, Reggie wishes that he needs to fly, and then when Irona, his robotic servant maid, accidentally turns off the machine, he tries to make a wish again. When it does not work the second time, he leaves the room in a huff, and retires. In jail, Richie and his friends are bailed out by root canal. They all rush to Reggie's house, and while he is still sleeping, Richie tries to wish himself back. However, they find that the machine is no longer working, as Reggie had kicked it in anger earlier. While Keanbean is fixing it, Reggie wakes up and comes flying in, only to be attacked by Richie and his friends. They defeat him and everyone quits working for him, with the police chief refusing to work for someone who would cancel Christmas. After that, the machine starts working again, and Richie wishes himself back as Richie Rich.    Richie sets right all the things that had gone wrong since his vanishing act, and is now much more grateful to be alive. As everyone is glad to have him back, they gather around the Christmas tree and sing.  ===Extended TV ending=== Reggie is caught red-handed with his actions against Richie, and apologies for all the trouble he caused to Richie, admitting that he was the one who took control of the sleigh and ruined the event. Richie realizes that it wasn't his fault and he made that wish for nothing. They forgive each other.

Sam and Vincent pursue them in a high-speed chase, which ends when Vincent shoots Deirdre's tire and sends her car over an overpass under construction. When Sam and Vincent fire at him, Gregor takes cover behind the flipped car (which is set ablaze by the gunfire). Gregor flees with the case, while road workers rescue Deirdre and Seamus from the burning vehicle. Sam and Vincent decide to track down the Russians and learn from one of Jean-Pierre's contacts that they are involved with figure-skater Natacha Kirilova (Mikhi's girlfriend), who is appearing at [[Le Zénith]].  During his girlfriend's performance that night Mikhi meets with Gregor, who says that a sniper in the arena will shoot Natacha if Mikhi betrays him. Mikhi kills Gregor and leaves with the case, letting the sniper kill Natacha. Sam and Vincent follow the panicked crowd out of the arena in time to see Seamus shoot Mikhi and steal the case. Sam runs ahead and finds Deirdre waiting in the getaway car; he tells her to leave, revealing himself as a CIA agent pursuing Seamus and not the case. Deirdre drives away, forcing Seamus to run back to the arena with Sam in pursuit. Seamus ambushes Sam, and is fatally shot by Vincent.  Sam and Vincent later talk in the bistro where they first met, while a radio broadcast announces that a peace agreement was reached between [[Sinn Féin]] and the British government (partially as a result of Seamus' death). Sam looks toward the door expectantly, but Vincent tells him that Deirdre will not be coming back. Sam drives off with his CIA contact, and Vincent pays the bill and leaves.  
Rounders (film)
 Gifted [[poker]] player and law student Mike McDermott ([[Matt Damon]]) dreams of playing in the [[World Series of Poker]] in [[Las Vegas]]. To do so, Mike moves up in stakes, risking his entire $30,000 bankroll while playing [[Texas hold 'em]] at an underground poker room, run by Teddy "KGB" ([[John Malkovich]]), a [[Russian mafia|Russian mobster]]. Distracted by his dreams of playing in Vegas, an overconfident Mike loses his entire bankroll in a hand against KGB when Mike goes all-in and KGB instantly calls the bet (Mike's full house of 9's over Aces loses to KGB's higher full house of Aces over 9's). Shaken and distraught, Mike decides to quit poker and decides to concentrate on law school, while promising his girlfriend and fellow law student Jo ([[Gretchen Mol]]) that he will no longer play. Mentor and fellow rounder Joey Knish ([[John Turturro]]) offers to stake Mike to help rebuild his bankroll; Mike declines and instead accepts a part-time job driving a delivery truck for Knish to make ends meet.  Mike focuses on school and work until his childhood friend Lester "Worm" Murphy ([[Edward Norton]]) is released from prison. While Mike is an honest card player who believes he can win playing straight, Worm is a hustler who often cheats to win and is unapologetic about it. Mike learns that Worm owes an outstanding debt that he incurred before his incarceration. In order to help Worm, Mike sets Worm up with a variety of poker games to play in across town, while Mike reluctantly plays in one game, which interferes with Mike's studies and hurts his relationship with Jo. Mike sets Worm up at the Chesterfield Club, in order to build a bankroll to pay his debt, and allows Worm to play on Mike's credit. Worm borrows $2,000 on Mike's credit and eventually wins $8,000; however, as he's cashing out, Worm takes the full $10,000 (including the $2,000 borrowed on Mike's credit), which begins a tab on Mike's name, accruing interest. Later, Worm runs into Grama ([[Michael Rispoli]]), a former colleague and a dangerous [[pimp]], at a strip club. Worm finds out that Grama bought up his outstanding debt and that Worm now owes $25,000 directly to Grama. Worm dismisses Grama's power, until Grama reveals that he is working with KGB to collect the debt. After a brief hassle from Worm, Grama takes the $10,000 from Worm before beating him up and threatening to do more if Worm does not pay the rest in a timely matter. As a result of Mike returning to his poker lifestyle and friends, and worried that Mike will lose everything a second time, Jo ends her relationship with Mike, refusing to go through that turmoil again.  Mike and Worm get into an argument when Mike finds out from Petra ([[Famke Janssen]]), one of the workers at the Chesterfield, that Worm has been playing at the Chesterfield often under Mike's credit, which results in Worm going on a losing streak and getting Mike into a $6,000 debt. While in Atlantic City, Mike also finds out from Worm about Worm's remaining $15,000 debt to Grama. Mike and Worm go to Grama's to negotiate Worm's debt. Mike tries to get Grama to give Worm leniency on the time to pay the debt, with Mike proposing that Worm pay $5,000 a week with the "juice" (interest) running until the debt is paid, calling it a "business decision" on Grama's part. Grama begins to consider Mike's proposal; however, when Grama begins to belittle Worm, an offended Worm mouths off, which results in an angry Grama giving Worm and Mike (who has now vouched for Worm) five days to pay the remaining $15,000 on the debt or face serious harm. Mike angrily reprimands Worm for allowing his ego to get the best of him and putting the both of them at risk. Mike decides to help Worm pay off his debt, with the plan being Worm scouts out games for Mike to play at and win. Worm wants to cheat to do it, but Mike insists on winning it straight at several card games around [[New York City]].  Mike begins to go on a run over several locations around town, winning several big pots and eventually the two make $7,200 in three days, needing to double that amount in 48 hours to pay the debt. Mike goes with Worm to an out-of-town game hosted by a group of [[New York State Police|New York State Troopers]], where Mike plays in. At one point during the game, Mike is up $4,200 and almost having the full $15,000 where Worm eventually arrives and plays in Mike's game, with Worm [[bottom dealing|base-dealing]] to give Mike the advantage to win. Eventually, Worm is caught base-dealing by one of the officers at the table when Worm catches a "hanger". When it is discovered that Worm's tactics benefitted Mike's hand, they are both beaten and relieved of their entire bankroll. Mike and Worm begin arguing outside, with Mike chastising Worm for Worm's stubborn insistence to always gain an edge to win while Worm reminds Mike that Mike's noble style of play to play smart and to win straight up also resulted in Mike losing his bankroll in one hand. Mike asks Worm to talk to Grama to get him out of the debt; however, Worm comes clean and advises Mike that Grama is working for KGB. Fully aware that their lives are in danger, Worm decides to flee; however, Mike decides to go back into the city to face the consequences and square the debt, cutting ties with Worm.  Mike decides to return to New York to deal with his situation. He meets with Grama to try and get an extension on the deadline. Grama reprimands Mike for vouching for Worm in the first place. Mike chastises Grama for working with KGB. Grama advises Mike to either take it up with KGB, pay the remaining amount, or face a potentially fatal fate. Mike tries to ask Knish for the money, before Knish refuses out of principle. Mike tells a story to Knish about a time in Atlantic City where Mike beat Johnny Chan in a hand of poker, which resulted in Mike making a run at KGB's place in the beginning of the movie. Remembering an earlier conversation Mike has with his law school professor Petrovsky ([[Martin Landau]]), Mike goes to Petrovsky's office to ask for the money as a loan. Unable to give Mike the full $15,000, Petrovsky give Mike $10,000 to help him get out of trouble. Mike cashes the check from Petrovsky, and challenges KGB to a second game of [[List of poker variants|heads-up, No-Limit Texas Hold'em]] for the remaining amount, with winner-take-all stakes, which KGB accepts. Mike beats KGB in the first session, winning $20,000. As Mike is content with his winnings, he decides to leave when KGB summons Grama to collect the $15,000 to square the debt. KGB offers Mike to let his winnings "ride" and continue playing. With enough money to pay off his and Worm's debt and half of the $10,000 loan from Petrovsky, Mike decides to leave the game. As he is about to leave, KGB taunts Mike, pointing out that KGB is still up $20,000 that Mike lost previously in the first game, goading Mike to continue.  Mike hesitates; then decides to continue playing, doubling the blinds at the risk of losing a second time, and possibly his life, to Grama and KGB. As the night wears on, Mike is on the verge of losing to KGB. While in a hand, he spots a [[Tell (poker)|tell]], a repeated behavior that allows him to know the value of KGB's hand (which is discovered to be the Oreo's that KGB eats as he's playing). Mike folds a hand, stating that KGB has a better winning hand. A befuddled KGB is irate that Mike folded the hand that KGB should've won and gotten paid for. Furious that Mike folded that hand and Mike potentially discovered his tell, KGB angrily tosses the Oreo's and begins to play on [[Tilt (poker)|"tilt"]], visibly shaken that Mike has now gotten the best of him. KGB becomes frustrated that Mike won't be defeated and that Mike is getting the better of him. In the final hand, KGB taunts Mike as Mike slow-plays his hand (8 and 9 of spades) and allows a boastful KGB to emotionally bet and eventually go all-in. Mike calls, revealing that Mike flopped a nut straight (6 to the 10) to defeat KGB. KGB angrily throws a tantrum and becomes unhinged at the way Mike played him in the second game, trapping KGB into a mistake. Grama urges KGB to continue; however, completely rattled, KGB states that he is done for the night. When KGB's goons go to beat up Mike, KGB calls them off and after admitting that Mike defeated him fairly, allows him to leave with his winnings.  Mike narrarates that he won over $60,000 as a result of the second game with KGB. Mike settles the remaining $15,000 of Worm's debt (calling his personal issue with Worm now "even"), he pays back $6,000 to the Chesterfield, repays the $10,000 loan to Petrovsky, and restores his original bankroll of "three stacks of high society." Mike drops out of law school, says goodbye to Jo, and leaves New York headed for Las Vegas with dreams of winning the World Series of Poker.  
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Movie
 One night, the Sprites of the Northern Lights - a group of singing sprites who fly around the North Pole - witness the birth of a baby reindeer named Rudolph, who has an unusual red, shiny nose. Later in the morning, Rudolph and his parents, Blitzen and Mitzi, meet up with Rudolph's three uncles - Dasher, Comet, and Cupid. Cupid tickles Rudolph and inadvertently triggers his glowing nose, which draws attention and causes Rudolph to become the center of scorn and mockery. Meanwhile, two of Santa Claus's elves, Doggle and Boone, cross the ice bridge of the wicked Ice Queen, Stormella, to deliver mail. They accidentally crash into and destroy several ice statues that belong to her. When Stormella finds out, she storms into Santa's workshop and demands him to hand Boone and Doogle over to her to face consequences. When he refuses, she closes her bridge to the public as punishment, and warns that if anybody dares to cross it, she will create a blizzard so strong it will stop Santa from delivering presents to children around the world on Christmas Eve.  Rudolph later starts attending school, where he is ridiculed by his classmates for wanting to be among Santa's reindeer, the Flyers, despite his nose. The only one who doesn't tease him is Zoey, a kind young doe who Rudolph has a crush on, and who reciprocates his feelings.   Years later, a teenage Rudolph takes part in the Junior Reindeer Games, which are responsible for selecting new Flyers for Santa. During a sleigh race event, Cupid's son and Rudolph's mean-spirted cousin Arrow (who is in a relationship with Zoey) implicitly causes the other competitors to crash and then tries to distract Rudolph by claiming that Zoey is only nice to him because she feels sorry for him, making Rudolph's nose glow in anger and blind Arrow. Though Rudolph wins the race, he is disqualified for blinding Arrow, and Arrow is made the winner by default. Zoey confronts Arrow for cheating in the race and ends their relationship. As Blitzen tries to defend his son's actions, an eavesdropping Rudolph misinterprets his father's statements as an admission of shame towards him, and decides to run away from home.  At night, unknowingly with the help and guidance of the Sprites of the Northern Lights, Rudolph journeys across the lands of the North Pole, and eventually befriends an Arctic fox named Slyly and a polar bear named Leonard. Meanwhile, Zoey learns from Blitzen and Mitzi that Rudolph ran away from home, and runs off in search of him. She eventually comes across Stormella's bridge the next morning and decides to cross it despite the consequences. However, she is caught by Stormella, who imprisons her. Upon learning about Rudolph and Zoey's disappearances from their parents, Santa sends Boone and Doggle to search for them. After having a bad dream, Rudolph meets the Sprites, who inform him of Zoey's capture and instruct him on how to properly use his nose. Rudolph, Leonard, and Slyly journey to Stormella's castle, but upon arrival, Slyly chooses to stay behind out of fear of Stormella's pet wolves while Rudolph and Leonard enter.  After Rudolph and Leonard are captured and imprisoned by Stormella, she fulfills her vow and unleashes a massive blizzard upon the North Pole. After Stormella goes to sleep, Slyly, having had a change of heart, sneaks into her bedroom and retrieves a key that unlocks the prison cells. However, Stormella wakes up, realizes this, and sends her pack of wolves after Rudolph and his friends, who eventually corner them on a cliff. When she threatens to freeze Zoey first, Rudolph uses his nose to blind Stormella, sending her toppling over the cliff and hanging on for dear life. Rudolph and the others then save Stormella, and she gratefully offers to grant him a wish. Much to the Ice Queen's dismay, Rudolph wishes that Stormella would be nice rather than to have a normal nose like he always would have wanted.  Though the wish takes full effect, Stormella is unable to stop the snowstorm that she created. Boone and Doggle later find and bring the entire group back to Santa's Village. Because of the blizzard, Santa is unable to carry out his flight this year, but when he sees Rudolph's glowing nose, Santa asks him to lead his team of Flyers. When Rudolph agrees, he is given a Medal of Valor, which all Flyers wear, and his father tells him that he is proud of him. Rudolph guides Santa's sleigh through the storm, and receives a hero's welcome when he returns.

Rushmore (film)
 Max Fischer (Schwartzman), an eccentric 15-year-old, is a scholarship student at Rushmore Academy, a [[private school]] in [[Houston]]. He is both Rushmore's most extracurricularly active and least scholarly student. He spends nearly all of his time on elaborate extracurricular activities, dramatically affecting his grades. He also has a feud with the school's headmaster, Dr. Guggenheim.  At a school assembly, Max meets Herman Blume (Murray), a disillusioned industrialist who finds his operation of a multimillion-dollar company to be tedious. He is upset that his marriage is failing and the two sons he's putting through Rushmore are impolite and obnoxious brats spoiled by their mother. Herman comes to like Max, and the two become good friends. Max is impressed by Herman's success, while Herman is interested in Max's confident persona.  Max also develops an obsession with Rosemary Cross (Williams), a widowed teacher who arrives at Rushmore as a new first grade instructor. She joined Rushmore after the death of her husband, who was a former  student. While she initially tolerates Max and his attempts to pursue her, Rosemary becomes increasingly worried by his obvious infatuation. Along the way, Blume attempts to convince Max that Rosemary is not worth the trouble, only to fall for Rosemary himself. The two begin dating without Max's knowledge.  After Max attempts to break ground on an aquarium without the school's approval, he is expelled from Rushmore. He is then forced to enroll in his first [[State school|public school]], Grover Cleveland High. Max's attempts to engage in outside activities at his new school have mixed results. A fellow student, Margaret Yang, tries to befriend Max, but he acts hostile towards her. Rosemary and Blume attempt to support him in his new school.  Eventually, Max's friend Dirk discovers the relationship between Rosemary and Blume and informs Max as payback for a rumor Max started about his mother. Max and Blume go from being friends to mortal enemies, and they engage in back-and-forth acts of revenge. Max informs Blume's wife of her husband's affair, thus ending their marriage. Max then puts [[bee]]s in Blume's hotel room, leading to Blume breaking  Max's bicycle with his car. Max is eventually arrested for cutting the brakes on Blume's car.  Max eventually gives up and meets Blume at his mother's grave. He explains that revenge no longer matters because even if he wins, Rosemary would still love Blume. Max becomes [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] and stops attending school. He becomes [[Recluse|reclusive]] and works as an apprentice at his father's barber shop. One day, Dirk stops by the shop to apologize to Max and bring him a Christmas present. Dirk suggests Max see his old headmaster in the hospital, knowing Blume will be there. Max and Blume meet and are courteous. Blume tells Max that Rosemary broke up with him due to her still being in love with her dead husband. Max begins to apply himself in school again, and he also develops a friendship with Margaret, whom he casts in one of his plays.  Max takes his final shot at Rosemary by pretending to be injured in a car accident, soliciting her affection. When she discovers that Max's injuries are fake, he is rebuffed again. Max makes it his new mission to win Rosemary back for Blume. His first attempt is unsuccessful, but then he invites both Herman and Rosemary to the performance of a play he wrote, making sure they will be sitting together. In the end, she and Blume appear to reconcile. Max and Margaret also become a couple.  
Run Lola Run
  ===Introduction===  Lola ([[Franka Potente]]) receives a frantic phone call from her boyfriend, Manni ([[Moritz Bleibtreu]]), a small-time criminal who has collected 100,000 [[Deutsche Mark]] in cash (equivalent to about $60,000)<ref></ref><ref name="Euro">At the time the movie was made, the [[Euro]] was about one year away from being introduced. The Deutsche Mark was discontinued in 2002.</ref> from his most recent crime. Lola had agreed to meet Manni and drive him to deliver the money to his boss, Ronnie. However, when Lola's [[moped]] was stolen and she fails to arrive on time, Manni takes a [[Rapid transit|subway train]]. He doesn't buy a subway ticket and panicks when he sees ticket inspectors. He quickly gets off the train, thoughtlessly leaving the bag containing the cash behind. From outside, he sees a homeless man examining the money bag as the train departs and the police grab Manni.  Manni calls Lola from a phone booth and tells her that unless he raises 100,000 mark to give Ronnie in the next 20 minutes, Ronnie will kill him. Manni also tells Lola of his plan to rob a nearby supermarket. Lola implores Manni to wait and promises to raise the money. She decides to ask her dad ([[Herbert Knaup]]), a bank manager, for help.  The rest of the film is divided into three runs by Lola. Each run starts the same way, but develops differently and has a different outcome. Each run has brief [[flashforward]] sequences that show how the lives of the people that Lola bumps into develop afterward.  [[Image:Run Lola Run apartment.jpg|thumb|The house in Albrechtstraße (Berlin-[[Mitte]]) where the three episodes begin]]  ===First run=== Lola hangs up the phone and starts running (in an animated sequence) down the staircase of her apartment building, past a [[Punk subculture|punk]] with a dog, and (back in live action) through the streets of [[Berlin]] towards her father's bank. She collides with a woman pushing a baby carriage, who is shown to later steal a baby after having lost custody of her own. Then Lola runs alongside a cyclist who offers to sell her his bike, which she refuses; a flash-forward shows him being beaten and his bike stolen, but later marrying a nurse he meets at the hospital afterwards. Lola then causes a minor car crash, which involves her father's colleague, Mr. Meier, and three men in a white [[BMW]]. As Lola arrives at the bank, she passes a banker shown later to be paralyzed in a car accident, then killing herself. She meets her dad, who dismisses her request for help. He reveals that he is not her biological father and that he plans to run away with his pregnant mistress, and then has Lola escorted out of the bank. The security guard who consoles her is shown to later suffer a heart attack.  Meanwhile, Manni uses a blind woman's phone card to call a friend. His friend says he can only give him 500 mark, which makes Manni angry. Lola runs alongside an ambulance that narrowly misses crashing into a glass pane being carried across a street by several men. Lola runs on to meet Manni, who is about to commit the robbery. She shouts his name, but he does not hear her and enters the store. Lola is forced to help him when a security guard intervenes. Once they obtain the money, they exit the store, but find themselves surrounded by police. Manni throws the bag with money up in the air, causing a nervous police officer to accidentally shoot Lola in the chest.  Lola recalls lying in bed with Manni talking about their love, and whether she wanted to leave him. The movie returns to the dying Lola. Her decision was to not leave Manni, and she does not want to die.  ===Second run=== Lola again starts running, only to be tripped by the man with the dog. Falling down the stairs, Lola injures her leg, which makes her limp temporarily. Running to the bank, she collides with the woman pushing a baby carriage, who later wins the lottery and lives a life of luxury. Passing the cyclist, she accuses him of stealing the bike he is selling; a flash forward shows he becomes homeless. Manni, again borrowing the blind lady's phone card, unsuccessfully tries to borrow money.  After causing a slightly different car accident between Mr. Meier and the white BMW, Lola arrives at the bank. Her later arrival, due to her earlier injury, allows her dad's mistress to explain he is not the child's father. Lola hears them arguing. Infuriated, Lola leaves the bank, but then comes back, grabs the security guard's gun, takes her father hostage and robs the bank. A flash forward shows a banker she passes falling in love with a colleague. Lola is confronted by the police, but escapes because they mistake her for a fleeing bystander. Passing the ambulance, Lola asks for a ride, distracting the driver and causing him to hit the glass pane. Reaching the rendezvous, Lola shouts Manni's name, and this time he hears her. Manni walks towards Lola, only to be run over by the speeding ambulance.  Manni recalls asking Lola how she would cope with his death. He believes she would mourn for a few weeks, then find another boyfriend, but Lola says that he is still alive. The film returns to the present and shows the injured or dying Manni.  ===Third run=== This time, Lola leaps over the punk and his dog. She avoids the woman with the baby carriage, who in a flash forward joins a church and devotes herself to God. Lola also narrowly misses the cyclist; he offers his bike to the homeless man, who uses some of Manni's money to buy it. Lola falls onto the bonnet of Mr. Meier's car, preventing his collision with the white BMW, allowing him to pick up Lola's dad. Lola sees them drive away. Disheartened, she continues running aimlessly and is nearly run over by a truck. She then sees a [[casino]] across the street. Having only 99 mark, she convinces the cashier to give her a 100-mark chip. Betting the chip at a [[roulette]] table, she wins 3,500 mark. She bets everything on the same number and wins over 100,000 mark. Leaving the casino with the money in a bag, she finds herself behind the ambulance. Lola climbs inside as it avoids the glass pane. An attendant is frantically working to keep the security guard from the bank alive. She holds the guard's hand and, to the attendant's surprise, his heart rate stabilises.  Meanwhile, after Manni's unsuccessful phone call, he spots the homeless man passing by on a bike, with his bag in the [[Bicycle basket|basket]]. Manni chases him, inadvertently causing a head-on collision between the white BMW, Mr. Meier, and the man who stole Lola's moped. Mr. Meier, Lola's dad and the thief are knocked out or dead. Manni manages to retrieve his money. The homeless man asks for his gun, and Manni, for some reason, gives it to him. Lola reaches the rendezvous, but cannot find Manni. She then sees a car pull up. Manni and Ronnie get out and shake hands. Manni joins Lola and asks her what is in the bag she is carrying. The film ends with a freeze-frame on Lola's reaction.  
Rush Hour (1998 film)
 On the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|last day of British rule]] in [[Hong Kong]] late 1997, Detective Inspector Lee of the [[Hong Kong Police Force]] leads a raid at a shipping bar wharf, hoping to arrest the mysterious crime lord Juntao. He finds only Sang, Juntao's right-hand man, who manages to escape. However, Lee successfully recovers numerous Chinese cultural treasures stolen by Juntao, which he presents as a farewell victory to his departing superiors: Chinese Consul Solon Han and British [[Commander#British police rank|Commander]] Thomas Griffin.  Shortly after Han arrives in the United States to take up his new diplomatic post in [[Los Angeles]], his daughter, Soo Yung, is kidnapped by Sang while on her way to her first day of school. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] informs Consul Han about the incident. Han calls in Lee to assist in the case. The FBI is afraid that the injury or death of Lee would result in negative attention internationally, decide to pawn him off on the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] just to keep him out of their way. The selfish, stubborn and maverick, Detective James Carter is tricked into doing this but Carter makes a plan to solve the case himself when he finds out that he has been given a boring task as punishment for botching a sting operation.  Carter meets Lee at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] and proceeds to take him on a sightseeing tour of LA, simultaneously keeping Lee away from the embassy and contacting several of his underworld informants about the kidnapping. Lee finally escapes and makes his way to the Chinese Consulate, where a nervous Han and a group of FBI agents are awaiting news about his daughter. While arguing with Agent-in-charge Warren Russ, Carter accidentally involves himself in a phone conversation with Sang, where he arranges a ransom drop of $50 million in a couple of hours.  The FBI traces the call to a warehouse and sends in a team of agents only to have them killed by a bomb. Spotting Sang nearby, Lee and Carter give chase, but Sang escapes, dropping the detonator in the process. Carter's colleague, LAPD bomb expert Tania Johnson, helps them trace the detonator to Clive, a man previously arrested by Carter. Clive is guilt-tripped by Lee into revealing his business relationship with Juntao whom he met a restaurant in [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] and this earns Carter's trust in Lee. Carter goes to the restaurant alone where he sees a surveillance video of Juntao carrying Soo-Yung into a van. Lee arrives and saves Carter's life, but the two are taken off the case after the FBI blames them for ruining the ransom drop. Angered at the accusation, Carter tries to talk some sense into the agents by claiming that he and Lee suspected another trap from Juntao's syndicate and that Han was going to lose his daughter anyway if they had gone through with the ransom drop. The FBI agents remove him to face proper punishment from his captain in the LAPD, while Lee is being sent back to Hong Kong by Han. Despite this setback, Carter appeals to Johnson for assistance and sneaks onboard Lee's plane, persuading Lee to help finish the case and stop Juntao. Griffin later involves himself in the case, revealing more about the HKPF's past with Juntao's syndicate.  At the opening of a Chinese art exhibition at the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]], which Han and Griffin are overseeing, the now $70 million ransom is being delivered. Carter, Lee and Johnson enter disguised as guests, where Carter distracts the guests into leaving for safety. This angers the FBI, but also blows Griffin's cover, as Lee catches him walking over to a bar and accepting a remote for the detonator from Sang. He and Johnson both conclude that Griffin is Juntao because Carter recognizes him from a surveillance tape in Chinatown. Griffin threatens to detonate a bomb vest attached to Soo Yung and demands the money be paid in full in compensation to the loss of the priceless Chinese artifacts he worked so hard to preserve. However, Carter manages to sneak out, locate her in the van, drives it into the building and brings her within range of Griffin, knowing that setting it off would kill him as well.  Johnson manages to get the vest off Soo Yung while Griffin heads toward the roof with the bag of money. Lee takes the vest and pursues Griffin while Carter coldly shoots Sang dead in an intense gunfight. Lee eventually catches up to Griffin, resulting in a brief altercation that culminates in the two dangling from the rafters under the roof. Griffin, holding onto the vest, falls to his death when the vest breaks, but before Lee falls, Carter is able to place a large flag underneath and catch him safely.  Han and Soo Yung are reunited, and Han sends Carter and Lee on vacation together to Hong Kong as a reward for their actions. Before Carter leaves, Agents Russ and Whitney offer him a position in the FBI, which he arrogantly refuses in revenge for how they treated him and Lee. Carter gets on the airplane with Lee, who starts singing [[Edwin Starr]]'s "[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]", angering Carter.

However, it becomes a media sensation with numerous news reporters constantly asking the adults questions and intentionally enrages Stu's brother [[Drew Pickles|Drew]] into attacking Stu by telling him he lost Angelica.  Tommy eventually finds Dil during a storm, and are forced to take shelter under a tree. But as Tommy tries to take care of him, Dil selfishly drinks all of the milk and keeps the large blanket for himself, which leads to the blanket tearing in half and Tommy falling into a puddle of mud. Tommy finally snaps and nearly pours banana baby food on Dil for the monkeys to take him away, but Tommy's rage and the storm's lightning and thunder scare Dil so much that he sees the error of his ways. They reconcile and sleep peacefully.  After the storm, the other babies find Tommy and Dil, and after running into Angelica and Spike they make their way to the "lizard". While on a bridge, they are confronted by the monkeys, but are then scared off by a [[wolf]] who's been hunting down the babies since they arrived in the woods. Spike intervenes and fights the wolf until they both fall from the bridge. Meanwhile, Stu, who has been looking for the babies via a [[pterodactyl]]-like aircraft he made, finally finds them, but crash lands into the ranger's cabin. Believing he is the "lizard," the babies wish for Spike back instead of going home. Stu falls through the bridge and finds Spike, who actually survived the fall. The babies are then reunited with their families, and the monkeys with their circus owners. The monkeys attack Rex Pester, one of the more obnoxious new reporters, much to Betty's amusement. The families return home and the babies accept Dil as one of the group.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Grandpa Pickles is sleeping in the Reptar Wagon when Grandpa Boris' goat kicks it, sending both the wagon and Grandpa down the street, presumably starting another adventure all over again.

Rustems records with drawing
 Action of the picture consisting of four short stories happens in [[Almaty]] and covers three days between summer and fall of 1997 — from August 31 to September 2. Declared as records of the main character with drawings, it doesn't apply for serious research of the teenage environment — it more likely a look from within for a while which as if stopped at the birth of heroes in 1979. Eighteen-year-old Rustem, unlike the business little sister Madina, is lazy and inert, he looks at the world cold eyes, having hidden behind the indifferent relation to people around. The strange girl Miko shy tries to destroy Rustem's rest by fragile feeling of the first love. Almost all actors, screenwriters (second-year students of masterful direction of game cinema of Ardak Amirkulov), artists, operators — graduates or students of [[Kazakh National Academy of Arts]]. In the movie scenes from the performance "[[The Brothers Karamazov]]" are used. Amirkulov enters the movie in a cinema context, having remembered not only Nugmanov film "[[The Needle (1988 film)|The Needle]]", but also Daneliya film "[[Walking the Streets of Moscow]]" and Ioseliani film "There lived a song thrush", beating through motive of the last fortieth anniversary — the city aimless wanderings of the hero behaving to finding, but coinciding often with finding of death. 
Samurai Fiction
 The plot centers on Inukai Heishirō ([[Mitsuru Fukikoshi]]), the son of a clan officer. One of his clan's most precious heirlooms, a sword given them by the Shogun, has been stolen by the samurai Kazamatsuri ([[Tomoyasu Hotei]]). Against his father's advice, Heishirō insists on retrieving the sword himself. His father sends two [[ninja]] after him to make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.  Kazamatsuri wounds Heishirō, and kills one of his companions. The young noble ends up staying with an older samurai ([[Morio Kazama]]) and his daughter Koharu (Tamaki Ogawa) while he heals from his wound and plans his next move. The older samurai tries to dissuade him from fighting, but Heishirō's honor won't allow him to leave Kazamatsuri alive. The older samurai, who turns out to be the master Hanbei Mizoguchi, convinces him to fight Kazamatsuri by throwing rocks rather than with swords.  Meanwhile, Kazamatsuri settles for a few days at a gambling house owned by Lady Okatsu ([[Mari Natsuki]]), who falls in love with him. Then one night one of the ninja sent to protect Heishirō bribes her to poison his sake for one thousand gold. She does, but Kazamatsuri tastes the poison and kills Okatsu. He then kidnaps Koharu in an attempt to get the master Mizoguchi to fight him.  Mizoguchi reveals to Heishirō that he killed Koharu's father, and has since never drawn his sword on another man, despite his immense skill. They then go to find Kazamatsuri and rescue Koharu. While Mizoguchi stalls Kazamatsuri, Heishirō takes Koharu aside and says he will marry her if Mizoguchi wins. Kazamatsuri fights Mizoguchi, who only draws his sword after his opponent destroys his wooden sword. He then disarms Kazamatsuri near a cliff.  Kazamatsuri, admitting defeat, commits suicide by jumping off the cliff. Heishirō and the others go to the bottom, where there is no sign of Kazamatsuri's body, but Koharu spots the stolen sword at the bottom of the river, where Heishirō retrieves it.

Salween (film)
  A text scroll at the opening of the film gives some historical background about [[Myanmar]] (or Burma) being granted independence after [[World War II]] by the [[United Kingdom]], without the problem of ethnic conflict with the [[Karen people]] on the country's border areas being resolved. So since then, the Burmese central government, then known as [[State Law and Order Restoration Council|SLORC]] and the [[Karen National Liberation Army]] have been engaged in a war that is little known to outside people.  A Thai timber baron, Tweepong, exploits the situation by courting both the KNLA and SLORC in order to have the unrest continue while his company logs the teak forests in the border region of the [[Salween River]].  Into this volatile, "[[American Old West|wild west]]" atmosphere comes a young, idealistic police lieutenant, Danai, who's to take charge of the police station at the border town of Fah Soong Pha Sak. He rides into town on his [[motorcycle]] as a gun battle has erupted between the police, led by tough Sergeant Ram, against some gun thugs. Danai, wearing his crisp police uniform, ends up dumped in a pig pen, covered in mud. He then gives the unkempt, undisciplined local policemen a dressing down, saying they all must clean up and wear their uniforms.  The gunmen who started the fight had been sent to kill Ram by Somsak Tweepong, son of the local "godfather". Somsak later visits Danai to invite him to his father's birthday party.  Eager to carry out his duties, Danai starts a foot patrol of his mountainous district and finds that his tight brown uniform and new boots are unsuited to the rugged terrain. While sitting down to rest and care for some blisters on his feet, he encounters a man nattily dressed in white clothes chasing [[butterfly|butterflies]] with a net. The man is the elder Tweepong, who gives Danai some salve.  After Danai leaves, Tweepong meets with a [[State Law and Order Restoration Council|SLORC]] colonel and gains intelligence about the Myanmar government's fight against the Karen.  Danai attends the birthday party for Tweepong, and meets Somsak's wife, who was a former beauty queen and actress from [[Bangkok]]. She is unhappily married to Somsak and has become an alcoholic.  Danai continues his tour of the district, meeting Nid, who is a teacher at a school for Thai hill-tribe children. She is also the daughter of Sergeant Ram. Her mother was a Karen woman, who was raped and killed by Somsak Tweepong's men, hence the deep resentment Ram has against Tweepong.  Further education comes for Danai when fighting between the KNLA and the SLORC spills over into Thailand. As Karen troops, led by KNLA Lieutenant Tulay, are being attacked by a SLORC [[helicopter]], they attempt to wade the [[Salween River]] and cross over into Thailand. Danai at first orders Ram to turn the Karen back, but after seeing the helicopter [[gunship]] decimate the Karen, he relents, even growing so frustrated as to fire upon the helicopter, which then fires back. However, nothing more comes of this incident.  But there is more drama in store, as Somsak discovers his wife having an affair. She accuses Somsak of being a homosexual, and Somsak grows enraged. His wife pulls out a gun, and Somsak tries to take it from her, shooting her in the process. She escapes and drives to the police station, where she dies after saying Somsak had shot her.  Somsak is now a fugitive, hiding in Myanmar. Danai at first believes he must go through proper channels to [[extradition|extradite]] Somsak, but Ram convinces him otherwise, and they take a party into Myanmar to get Somsak back by force.  Somsak's father makes a deal with the KNLA to give them [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger]] missiles in exchange for saving his son. Tulay and his men sneak up on Danai's party at night, but let them live in exchange for saving their lives during the earlier incident at the river. Danai tells Tulay that Somsak had committed murder and must be brought back to Thailand for trial. "This is [[Karen people#Kawthoolei|Kawthoolei]]. Thai laws have no meaning here," Tulay replies. The next morning, the Karen attack. Ram is fatally shot, but he is able to get off a shot that injures Tulay. Danai and the survivors, including Ram's daughter, take Somsak and head back to Thailand.  Just as Danai and Nid are crossing a small river bridge back to Thailand, they come under attack again by Tulay, who, though injured, was waiting under the water just upstream to ambush them. However, then SLORC troops show up and shoot Tulay. The SLORC colonel says he has made a deal with Tweepong for Somsak, and orders Danai to drop his weapons. Tulay, though, is not yet dead. He floats downstream under the bridge and fatally shoots the colonel. Somsak then runs back towards Myanmar, but Nid still has her pistol. She hands it to Danai, who then shoots Somsak in the back to death.

They suffer heavy losses in assaulting fortified German defensive positions. Captain Miller of the [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd Ranger Battalion]] leads a breakout from the beach, eventually destroying the Nazi machine gun nests and opening a path for the Allied tanks to come ashore. Elsewhere on the beach, a dead soldier lies face-down in the bloody surf; his pack is stenciled ''Ryan,S''.  In [[Washington, D.C.]], at the [[U.S. War Department]], General [[George Marshall]] learns that three of the four brothers of the Ryan family were [[killed in action]] and that the fourth son, James, is with the [[101st Airborne Division]] somewhere in Normandy. Initially Marshall's order to rescue Ryan gets rejected due to the amount of manpower needed as well as uncertainty as to whether or not Ryan is even still alive.  After reading [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Bixby letter]] aloud, Marshall orders Ryan brought home.  Three days after [[Normandy landings|D-Day]], Miller returns from an assignment destroying Nazi equipment and receives orders to find Ryan and bring him back. He chooses six men from his company—[[Technical sergeant|T/Sgt.]] Horvath, Privates First Class Reiben and Caparzo, Privates Mellish and Jackson, [[Combat medic|medic]] Wade—plus [[Technician Fifth Grade|T/5]] Upham, an interpreter from headquarters. They move out to Neuville, where they meet a squad of the 101st engaged against the enemy. Caparzo is killed by a German sniper who is then killed by Jackson. They locate a Private James Ryan but he is not the right one. The team make their way through German infested land and arrive at an Allied military camp. While in the camp, Miller learns from soldiers who have been scattered from their battalion that Ryan is defending an important bridge in Ramelle.  Near Ramelle, Miller decides to neutralize a German machine gun position at a derelict radar station, despite his men's misgivings. Miller's reason is that even though they can sneak pass the machine gun, the next Allied group may not notice it and get ambushed. Wade is killed in the skirmish. At Upham's urging, Miller declines to execute a surviving German soldier, and sets him free. Losing confidence in Miller's leadership, Reiben declares his intention to desert, prompting a confrontation with Horvath, which Miller defuses by disclosing his civilian career as a high school English teacher, about which has been a secret and has had his men had set up a betting pool to see who can determine what he does back at home. Reiben is moved by Miller's reasons as to why he took on his mission (He believes that if he is able to save Ryan, it will earn him a ticket back home to his family) and stays.  On the way to Ramelle, Miller and his team run into Ryan and his platoon, who are out destroying German tanks. At Ramelle, Ryan is among a small group of paratroopers preparing to defend the key bridge. Miller tells Ryan that his brothers are dead, and that he was ordered to bring him home. Ryan is distressed about his brothers, but he will not leave the fight. Miller and his team become angry, telling Ryan about Wade and Carparzo who both died trying to find him. Ryan says that his place is here with his brother in arms, and that he will not abandon them. Sensing that Ryan will not leave, Miller combines his unit with the paratroopers in defense of the bridge against the imminent German attack. Miller prepares to ambush the enemy with various .30 caliber guns, Molotov cocktails, detonation cords, anti-tank mines and impromptu satchel charges made from socks.  Elements of the [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich|2nd SS Panzer Division]] arrive with two [[Tiger I|Tiger]] tanks and two [[Marder III|Marder assault guns]], all protected by foot soldiers. Although the Americans inflict heavy casualties on the Germans, including destroying one Tiger tank, both Marders and a [[2 cm Flak 30/38/Flakvierling|20 mm gun]], most of the paratroopers, along with Jackson, Mellish and Horvath are killed, while Upham is immobilized by fear and freezes up. Miller attempts to blow up the bridge, a last resort if the Germans were to take the town, but is shot and mortally wounded by the freed German prisoner from the radar station, who had somehow rejoined a fighting unit. Miller crawls to retrieve the bridge detonator, and fires ineffectually with his pistol at the oncoming tank. As the tank reaches the bridge, an American [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]] flies overhead and destroys the tank, after which American armored units arrive to rout the remaining Germans. Having seen Miller get shot, Upham leaps out from hiding and confronts the German prisoner, shooting and killing him.  Reiben and Ryan are with Miller as he utters his last words, "James... earn this. Earn it."  The elderly veteran is revealed to be Ryan and the grave he is standing at is Miller’s. Ryan asks his wife if he has lived a life worthy of Miller and his team's sacrifice, in which she tells him that he had. He salutes Miller's grave.

The Saved
 ''The Saved'' portrays the true story of about 600 [[Jews]] from the [[Netherlands]] and uncovers the shame that haunts them decades subsequent to their experience.  This group of individuals was specially selected to live through the [[Holocaust]] since they were regarded as beneficial to their nation.  Conversely, almost a hundred thousand Jews living in the Netherlands were expelled from the country and murdered by the [[Nazi]]s.<ref name= "Dutch Film Database">{{cite web   | title = Een gelukkige tijd (The Saved)   | publisher = Nederlandse Film Database   | date = September 2008   | url = http://nfdb.akris.nl/nfdb/servlet/FrameSetter?lang=en&cols=2&url=search&target=col1&action=search_simple_film&words=Een+gelukkige+tijd&way=and   | accessdate = September 15}}</ref>  After a high-ranking [[Hague]] bureaucrat<ref name= "Icarus Films (Distributor)">{{cite web   | title = The Saved   | publisher =Icarus Films   | date = May 2008   | url = http://www.frif.com/new2000/save.html   | accessdate = September 15}}</ref>   chose to intercede in order to assist a confidant, he was able to obtain a pact of sorts, which assured the safety of a pair of notable Jews and their households.  When news of the deal became public, the Jewish population throughout the Netherlands wrote letters urging to be added onto the exclusive list.  It was ultimately expanded to include hundreds of Jews.  The group included renowned educators, artists, doctors and scientists.  They came to be identified as the Barneveld group.  Sent off to a distant Dutch [[castle]], the Barneveld Jews formed a mini-city shaped after the world of high culture and refinement, which they were accustomed to at home.  While the terror of the Holocaust devastated a majority of the [[European Jewish]] population, the Barneveld residents existed in comparative ease.  Inhabitants carried along with the; home furnishings and porcelain dishware.  A school was established and musical performances took place.  As opposed to individuals held captive at [[death camps]], the Barnevelders could spend time grooming themselves. A survivor remembers that the women constantly had their hair fashioned in the latest styles and the men never went a day without shaving. Love developed in the Barneveld community due to the close proximity of men and women.  A couple met, became engaged and today have four adult children, their lifelong journey together started at the Barneveld home.  As the castle’s population began to rise, the large home became more and more crowded.  Some residents compared the situation to being in a large jail cell, with no bars.  Soon after food was given out in [[rations]] and to make the most out of sleeping quarters, the men and women were divided into [[barracks]] styled housing.  As time progressed communication with life beyond the castle was severely limited. Collectively, the unit fought to preserve an impression of individual pride and an air of ordinariness.  Coping within the castle was difficult for a former resident, because everything that belonged to them was taken away; so it was challenging to show your uniqueness.  In September 1943, the Barneveld clique was relocated to [[Westerbork transit camp|Westerbork]], a Nazi labor camp located in Netherlands.  The jolt was tremendous, from living in a mansion to residing in camp quarters.  They were compelled by the [[Germany|Germans]] to take part in the expulsion of their neighbors at the camp.  The Barnevelder group observed relatives and acquaintances being transferred form Westerbork to [[Auschwitz]].  However, the Barnevelders continued to be untouched. While the environment they lived in constantly worsened, the protection of their lives continued.  Ultimately, the Barnevelders were moved to [[Theresienstadt]], where they were forced to witness the death of relatives and friends members.  Yet their destinies were secure.  Virtually every Barnevelder accomplished to come out of [[World War II]] physically whole.  Nevertheless the emotional pain lingers, and for many, the feeling of sorrow due to living through the war is even still now hard to conquer.  At every point the chosen group was rescued from murder, although some see their continued existence as a blessing and a burden.  The discussion of this past situation is one that leads to uproar, by the very people who lived through this experience.  At the beginning of the documentary a Barnevelder expresses their displeasure about the creation of the film.  This member believes more focus is due on the Dutch Jews that were killed, whose number total 100,000.  Not on the extremely small minority that managed to survive throughout the war.<ref name= "Dutch Documentaries ">{{cite web   | title = NPS.DOC   | publisher = Nederlandse Programma Stichting   | date = May 1998   | url = https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=nl&u=http://www.omroep.nl/nps/tv/nps.doc/barneveld/&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=3&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3DGelukkige%2Btijd%2B-%2Bhet%2Bverhaal%2Bvan%2Bde%2BBarneveldjoden,%2BEen%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26channel%3Ds%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26hs%3DD7d%26sa%3DG   | accessdate = September 15}}</ref>   All the same, the anomaly that is the Barnevelder group commands to be explored .

Savior (film)
 Joshua Rose (Dennis Quaid), a U.S. Department of State official on embassy duty in Paris, sees his wife (Nastassja Kinski) and son killed in a bombing by suspected [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorists]]. Immediately after the family funeral he storms into a nearby mosque and shoots several worshipers. His friend Peter (Stellan Skarsgård) is forced to shoot one of the survivors when the man tries to kill Rose, and in order to avoid arrest they join the [[French Foreign Legion]], with Joshua taking the name Guy.  Years later, Joshua, now going by the name of "Guy", and Peter are fighting for the [[Bosnian Serbs]] in the [[Bosnian War]]. They are stationed on a bridge separating them and the [[Bosniaks]] in a town. Guy mans a sniper post overlooking the bridge, and witnesses Peter's death when Peter drops his guard at a checkpoint and a young girl throws a grenade at him. Guy in turn shoots a boy crossing the bridge in pursuit of his runaway goat.  Guy is then seen searching the Muslim side of the town following a ceasefire along with a Bosnian Serb soldier Goran ([[Sergej Trifunović]]). In one house they find an elderly Muslim woman who is confined to bed and shell-shocked and a dead woman. Guy also finds a sleeping baby who has been hidden in a wardrobe but does not inform Goran who hacks a finger off an old Bosniak woman in order to steal her ring.  After they leave the house helicopters attack the town. As Goran takes cover Guy stays out in the open and returns to the house, but finds that both the child and the old lady have been killed by falling rubble. Later, Guy and Goran prepare for a prisoner exchange with the [[ARBiH|Bosniak forces]]. When they arrive at the exchange point one of the young Serb female prisoners being exchanged, Vera ([[Nataša Ninković]]), is visibly pregnant because she was raped by the Muslim forces. Guy and Goran take her in Goran's car and they head towards her village.  In the car Goran berates Vera for being impregnated by a Bosniak even though Guy points out that she was almost certainly raped. Goran eventually stops the car in a tunnel. He throws Vera out of the car and begins to kick her as she lies on the ground. The blows force Vera into [[premature labor]]. As Goran prepares to murder the soon-to-be-born child, Guy shoots and kills Goran and then helps deliver the baby. When he shows Vera the child, a girl, she rejects it and attempts to shoot herself before Guy manages to stop her.  They arrive at her house where she is rejected by her family due to the shame felt by her father. They leave her house with Guy intending to head for a refugee camp where Vera and the baby would be looked after. Vera continues to reject the child and [[Selective mutism|does not talk]] to Guy. After being told by Goran's family that his corpse has been found and that he was last seen in the company of Guy and Vera, Vera's father and brother head off in pursuit of them. They eventually catch up with them when they stop to get milk for the child. Guy is shot and injured, but Vera places herself between him and her father as he goes to kill him, and her father backs off and allows them to leave when Guy tells him that Goran intended to kill both Vera and the baby.  They briefly return to Vera's village to find it has been attacked, and have to watch from a distance as her family and other villagers are rounded up and led away by Bosniak militiamen. Guy decides to head for the safety of the UN zone in [[Split (city)|Split]] on the [[Dalmatian Coast]]. On their way they stop and take refuge with an elderly Croat man and his Bosnian Serb wife. The old man tells Guy "before the war, no difference [between Serbs and Croats], and now, stupid", pointing to his head to show madness.  After moving on they reach what they think is a relatively safe area. Vera leaves Guy and the child to rest in an abandoned and half-sunk boat on the edge of a lake while she goes to find a bus that will take them to Split. Vera is captured along with other civilians by members of the [[Croatian Defense Council]]. The Croats take their prisoners to the waterfront where Guy is hiding in the boat. One Croat then proceeds to beat several to death with a sledgehammer, including Vera, as they stand in the water. The fighters shoot those that are left as Guy witnesses the slaughter from inside the boat but can do nothing without giving himself and the child away. He smothers the baby in order to keep her quiet as the soldiers prepare to leave. She stops breathing but is soon resuscitated by Guy.  Guy eventually makes his way onto a bus that takes him and the baby to Split where he leaves Vera's baby in an unattended [[Red Cross]] vehicle and writes the name "Vera" on a paper before walking to a pier, throwing his rifle and scope in the water and collapsing on a bench. A woman who was on the bus with him approaches him, carrying the girl and offering help. When she asks if the baby is his, Guy replies that she is and the woman promises to take them both to a hospital.  
Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island

[[Daphne Blake]] and [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]] start running a successful television series called ''Coast to Coast with Daphne Blake''; [[Velma Dinkley]] becomes the proprietor of a mystery bookstore; [[Shaggy Rogers]] and his dog [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] are fired from their job at an airport after eating all of the confiscated foods. For Daphne's birthday, Fred decides to get the gang back together for a road trip while Daphne is filming her show.  After encountering a lot of fake monsters, the gang finally arrives in [[New Orleans]]. They are soon invited by a young woman named Lena Dupree to visit her employer's home on Moonscar Island, which is allegedly haunted by the ghost of the pirate Morgan Moonscar. Though the gang is skeptical, they go with Lena, to whom Fred has taken a fancy.  On the island, the gang meets Lena's employer Simone Lenoir, as well as the ferryman Jacques, and Simone's gardener Beau, to whom Daphne takes a fancy. They also meet Snakebite Scruggs, an ill-natured fisherman, and his hunting pig, Mojo. The gang sets out to prove that the "ghost" is a fake. Shaggy and Scooby are chased by Mojo and end up falling into a big hole, where they encounter the zombie of Morgan Moonscar. By the time the rest of gang comes to investigate, Moonscar is not around.  Simone invites the gang to her house to stay for the night. As the gang is dressing up for dinner, Shaggy sees the ghost of a Confederate colonel in the mirror; Simone explains that the island was a temporary [[headquarters]] for a Confederate regiment during the [[American Civil War]]. Due to Simone's cats, Shaggy and Scooby eat in the Mystery Machine, but find the food spicy and get some water from the lake, where an army of zombies emerge. Shaggy's bad driving gets the Mystery Machine stuck in the mud, forcing him and Scooby to flee on foot.  Fred and Daphne find the Mystery Machine, but no sign of Shaggy and Scooby. They argue about each other's supposed love interests and come across Shaggy and Scooby. They manage to capture a zombie, which is revealed to be real when Fred pulls its head off thinking it is a mask. As the zombies swarm around them, the gang splits in panic. Elsewhere, Shaggy and Scooby discover wax dolls that look like Fred, Velma, Daphne and Beau, and they play with them, causing their friends to undertake a series of involuntary actions for a short time until they leave after disturbing a nest of bats.  Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Beau return to Simone's house and discover a secret passage under the staircase. They find Lena, who tells them that the zombies dragged Simone away. They find a secret chamber for voodoo rituals, where Velma finds footprints of Simone's heels and interrogates Lena about the story. Simone then appears, and she and Lena use voodoo dolls to trap the gang in the chamber before revealing themselves to be evil cat creatures. When Velma recognizes this, she accuses Simone of stealing Morgan Moonscar's treasure. Angered by the mentioning of Moonscar, Simone explains that centuries ago, they were part of a group of settlers who were devoted to a cat god. When Moonscar and his pirates chased the settlers into a bayou filled with alligators that later ate them, the vengeful Simone and Lena asked their cat god to curse Moonscar. Their wish was granted and they killed Moonscar and his crew, but the curse caused them to become cat creatures permanently, provided that they keep draining life forces every harvest moon to preserve their immortality. Jacques joined them later on, agreeing to bring them more victims in exchange for immortality. Thus the repentant zombies' intent was to warn the gang to leave to escape their fate.  Finding Shaggy and Scooby, Jacques transforms into a cat creature and chases them to drain their lives. Thanks to the zombies, Shaggy and Scooby escape and accidentally tumble into the cave, interrupting the draining ceremony and distracting the cat creatures. Velma quickly unties herself and creates voodoo dolls of Simone and Lena to interrupt their ritual. When they are finally cornered, the cat creatures' curse expires, causing them to age hundreds of years and disintegrate, freeing and avenging the zombies' souls and allowing them to rest in peace. Beau is revealed to be an undercover police officer sent to investigate the disappearances on the island. Daphne offers Beau a chance to guest-star on her show and discuss the adventure. The next morning, everyone leaves the island via ferry to head back to town.  In a post-credits scene, Scooby feeds the cats some milk before howling out his name to the viewers.

Darryl is so broke he donates four pints of blood in one day (playing a different character each time) and four vials of sperm in one day. Darryl's big break comes when he enters a competition, where the winner gets a high-paying [[Wall Street]] job. But when Scott enters the competition, it seems Darryl's break has gone down the drain.  He takes on a high-paying [[experiment]] to test a drug that enhances the five senses.

The Seller
 Bart ([[Brian Brophy]]), a used car salesman in the midst of realizing his life is a failure, kills the obnoxious parents of what he believes is an abused 12-year-old brat, Melissa ([[Kathy Morozova]]), as he tries to close them in the sale of the only car he has left on his lot. Despite witnessing this, Melissa refuses to shoot him when he hands her the gun and tells her he would “understand”, then promises to take her cross-country to Texas to live with her only surviving family, Aunt Betty ([[Mink Stole]]), in what he believes will be a final act of salvation - one last good deed. With his two salesmen, Dwight ([[Adam Paul (actor)|Adam Paul]]) and Derrick ([[Arthur Roberts (actor II)|Arthur Roberts]]) in tow, they take flight from the murders and one Quinton Bendick ([[Andre Marquis]]), Bart's sadistic mentor, former friend and creditor, and become an odd family with Derrick serving as a father figure for Bart and Dwight, while Bart becomes father and friend to this tough, intelligent 12-year-old.   At a river bed Bart dances a 70's line dance with Melissa in front of the car that contains the bodies of her parents, just before he dumps it into a river. In an accident of fate, the group discovers Melissa's prowess with a gun, and Bart teaches her about life, wearing the white hat, doing the right thing, and [[Annie Oakley]], whom she comes to idolize.   Bart and Melissa team up to do a trade to a small town used car salesman (David Alexander) as Melissa comes to Bart's aid for the first time. A small town bartender matches bravado with Derrick with disastrous results for Dwight when he hits him in the head with a beer mug, wounding him severely.  Stopping in a lounge Bart dances with Melissa again, and as she begins to feel her youth and freedom we watch her through Bart's not so parental eyes. In a seedy small-town motel it becomes apparent Dwight's head wound is too severe to ignore, and Derrick and Dwight leave the group to take Dwight to a hospital.  On a dry lakebed we witness the bonding, friendship, and tragedy of Bart and Melissa's haunting relationship before it builds to a final climax at Aunt Betty's house as Quinton shows up and the terror, beauty, and banality of their journey come to a head. Quinton humiliates and degrades Bart in front of Melissa, and Bart's compliance with and embrace of his humiliation motivates Melissa to a surprising, violent, and bittersweet action. The first adult decision of this 12-year-old ensues; a wrenching decision full of the mixed emotions of both characters, and fantasy of what could have been, and what ultimately could never be.

Shakespeare in Love
 In 1593 London, William Shakespeare is a sometime player in the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] and poor playwright for [[Philip Henslowe]], owner of [[The Rose (theatre)|The Rose Theatre]]. Shakespeare is working on a new comedy, ''Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter''. Suffering from [[writer's block]], he has barely begun the play, and is further distracted by attempts both to seduce Rosaline, the mistress of [[Richard Burbage]], owner of the rival [[Curtain Theatre]] and to convince Burbage to buy the play from Henslowe. Shakespeare receives helpful advice on his play from rival playwright [[Christopher Marlowe|Christopher 'Kit' Marlowe]]', but becomes despondent when he learns Rosaline is sleeping with [[Edmund Tylney|Edmund Tilney]], the powerful [[Master of Revels]].  Henslowe, who is in debt to the ruthless moneylender Fennyman and in desperate need for a new play, begins auditions anyway.  Viola de Lesseps, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, who has seen Shakespeare's plays at court, disguises herself as a man named Thomas Kent to audition. "He" gains Shakespeare's interest when he auditions with a speech from [[Two Gentlemen of Verona]] after a series of actors bore him by reciting [[Christopher Marlowe]], but when Shakespeare questions her, Viola runs away in fear of being discovered. Shakespeare pursues Kent to Viola's house and leaves a note with the nurse, asking Thomas Kent to begin rehearsals at the Rose. He sneaks into the house with the minstrels playing that night at the ball, where Viola's parents are arranging her betrothal to Lord Wessex, an impoverished aristocrat. While dancing with Viola, Shakespeare is struck speechless, but is forcibly ejected by Wessex. Wessex also asks Will's name, to which he replies that he is Christopher Marlowe after Wessex threatens to kill him. Shakespeare sneaks into Viola's garden, finding her on her balcony, where they briefly confess their mutual attraction to each other before he is discovered by her nurse and flees.  Inspired by Viola, Shakespeare writes quickly, completely transforming the play into what will become ''Romeo and Juliet''. Rehearsals begin, with "Thomas Kent" as Romeo, the leading tragedian [[Edward Alleyn|Ned Alleyn]] as Mercutio and the stagestruck Fennyman given a small role as the Apothocary. Shakespeare soon discovers Viola's true identity, and they begin a secret affair.  Viola is summoned to court to receive approval for her proposed marriage to Lord Wessex. Shakespeare accompanies her, disguised as her female cousin. There, he persuades Wessex to wager £50 that a play can capture the true nature of love, the exact amount Shakespeare requires to buy a share in the Chamberlain's Men. [[Queen Elizabeth I]] declares that she will judge the matter when the occasion arises.  When Burbage finds out that Shakespeare has both seduced Rosaline and cheated him out of the money he was paid for the play, he goes to the Rose Theatre with his Curtain Theatre Company and starts a brawl. The Rose Theatre company drives Burbage and his company out and then celebrate at the local pub, where a drunken Henslowe lets slip to a horrified Viola that Shakespeare is married, albeit separated from his wife. News arrives that Marlowe has been murdered, and a guilt-ridden Shakespeare believes Wessex has had Marlowe killed, believing him to be Viola's lover. Viola briefly believes Shakespeare has been murdered but he appears at her church, terrifying Wessex who believes he is a ghost. Viola confesses her love for Shakespeare, but both recognize she cannot escape her duty to marry Wessex.  [[John Webster]], an unpleasant young boy who hangs around the theatre, spies on Shakespeare and Viola making love and informs Tilney, who closes the Rose for breaking the ban on women actors. Viola's identity is exposed, leaving them without a stage or lead actor, until Richard Burbage offers them his theatre and the heartbroken Shakespeare takes the role of Romeo. Following her wedding, Viola learns that the play will be performed that day, and runs away to the Curtain. Planning to watch with the crowd, Viola overhears that the boy playing Juliet cannot perform, [[Voice change|his voice having broken]] overnight, and Henslowe asks her to replace him. She plays Juliet to Shakespeare's Romeo to an enthralled audience.  Master Tilney arrives to arrest everyone for indecency due to Viola's presence, but the Queen reveals herself having been in attendance and restrains Tilney, instead asserting that Kent's resemblance to a woman is, indeed, remarkable. However, even a queen is powerless to end a lawful marriage, and she orders Kent to "fetch" Viola because she must sail with Wessex to the [[Colony of Virginia]]. The Queen also tells Wessex, who followed Viola to the theatre, that ''Romeo and Juliet'' has won the bet for Shakespeare, and has Kent deliver his £50 with instructions to write something "a little more cheerful next time, for [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]]".  Viola and Shakespeare say their goodbyes, and he vows to immortalise her, as he imagines the beginning of ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', [[Viola (Twelfth Night)|in character]] as a [[castaway]] disguised as a man after a voyage to a strange land.  
Shadow Builder
 An evil Archbishop and his followers summon a demon to destroy the world, but the demon's first act is to kill its summoners. It does so in an appropriately unique manner, by turning the bodies of its victims into what appears to be solid shadow, which disintegrates at the first touch of light, any light. Light is in fact the demon's anathema. Unable to stand the slightest glimmer at its creation, the creature gains strength and solidity with each kill, allowing it a greater resistance to the light; and with it the ability to affect and control those around it, including a pack of vicious dogs. As the town is orchestrated towards its own destruction, it proceeds to hunt down a particular child. A pivotal sacrifice, necessary to complete its transition into the light, and unleash its Evil.

Matters come to a head when Siddharth wants to play the guitar at a college function, Shanti wants to take part in the fashion parade—both need money and, of course, papa isn't in the mood to indulge such extravagance.  Enter Raju ([[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]]). A foundling brought up by Sumitra, who ekes out a living running an idli stall, Raju is a diehard Rajnikanth fan, working in a garage to help make both ends meet. Trouble begins when Raju loses his job, has a drink or three to ease the angst, and finds himself standing outside Siddharth-Shanti's home, gaping from outside at what he imagines is the rich life within.  At this point, the family car rams into him. Raju is quickly carted inside the home by papa's servants—with a foreign delegation due any minute, the last thing he needs is embarrassment outside his gates. Raju is tucked up in bed. Not that there is anything wrong with him, but he figures he might as well play possum and enjoy as much of the 'rich' life as he can get.  The carefree lad makes friends with Sidharth and Shanti, listens to their vows, and promises to help them out. The threesome set off in papa's precious vintage car—and the movie from there on turns into a caper, revolving around the events of one frenetic day. Raju and Shanti become romantic, Siddharth pairs up with Suji, a baddie ([[Prakash Raj]]) comes into the equation, and a kidnapping goes wrong as Raju is mistaken for Siddharth. How the foursome get out of the mess is what the rest of the movie is all about.

The farm is owned by the descendants of the Dabney family, consisting of Vernon (Keitel), Trixie (McDowell) and their seven children. But to bury a black man on that land is a violation of strict Virginia law, so the family goes through the arduous task of figuring out how to grant his request. Along the way they form a touching bond with the former slave and sharecropper, who has outlived both his former wives and some 35 children.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9810/28/review.shadrach/ Tatara, Paul.

The bomb turns out to be a paint bomb and the terrorists escape. The FBI receives demands to release Sheikh Ahmed bin Talal, a suspect in an earlier bombing. Hubbard eventually comes into conflict with [[Central Intelligence Agency]] agent Elise Kraft (Annette Bening), as he takes a terrorist suspect into custody and arrests Kraft. Later, another terrorist threat is made and a [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] bus is bombed. FBI captures a man named Samir Nazhde ([[Sami Bouajila]]), who admits to signing the visa application of one of the suicide bombers in the course of signing many applications for student visas in his job as a lecturer. However, Kraft insists that Samir is not a terrorist and that his continued freedom is vital to the investigation.  The terrorist incidents escalate with the bombing of a bus and a crowded theater and hostage-taking at an elementary school, and culminate in the destruction of One Federal Plaza, the location of the FBI's New York City field office, with over 600 casualties. In spite of objections, the [[President of the United States]] declares [[martial law]] and the [[United States Army]]'s [[101st Airborne Division]], under [[Major general#United States|Major General]] William Devereaux (Bruce Willis), occupies and seals off [[Brooklyn]] in an effort to find the remaining terrorist cells. Subsequently, all young men of Arab descent, including Haddad's son Frank Jr., are rounded up and detained in [[Downing Stadium]]. Haddad resigns in outrage. New Yorkers stage violent demonstrations against the Army and the profiling of the Arabs; the Army fights to maintain control. There are reports of Army killings.  Hubbard and Kraft, now revealed to be an agent named Sharon Bridger, continue their investigation and capture a suspect, Tariq Husseini. Devereaux's men torture and kill Husseini in the course of the interrogation. Afterward, Bridger tells Hubbard that Husseini revealed nothing of value because of the principle of [[Compartmentalization (information security)|compartmentalized information]]. Sickened, she finally admits that she herself provided training and support to militants opposed to [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime, working with Samir to recruit and train the followers of the Sheikh. After the U.S. cut their funding and left them exposed, she took pity on the few of them who had not yet been slaughtered by Hussein's forces, and arranged for them to escape to the United States, ultimately leading to the present situation as they turn their bomb making and covert skills on the country that now holds their leader. Sharon and Hubbard compel Samir to arrange a meeting with the final terrorist cell. Hubbard also convinces Haddad to return to the FBI.  A multi-ethnic peace march demonstrates against the occupation of Brooklyn. As the march is getting under way Hubbard and Haddad arrive at the meeting place, but Bridger and Samir have already left. Samir reveals to Bridger that he constitutes the final cell while in another sense he says, "there will never be a last cell." He straps a bomb to his body which he intends to detonate among the marchers. Hubbard and Haddad arrive in time to prevent him leaving but Samir shoots Bridger in the heart as she struggles to stop him. Hubbard and Haddad kill Samir but despite their best efforts the two can only watch as Bridger succumbs to her wound after managing to recite certain lines of the second half of the [[Lord's Prayer]] and concluding with "[[Inshallah]]" &ndash; the Arabic phrase "God Willing".  Hubbard, Haddad, and their team raid Devereaux's headquarters to make an arrest for the torture and murder of Husseini. Deveraux insists that under the [[War Powers Resolution]] the authority vested in himself by the President supersedes that of the court which issued the [[arrest warrant]]. He then commands his soldiers to aim their assault rifles at the agents, resulting in a [[Mexican standoff]]. Hubbard reminds Devereaux that the civil liberties and human rights which he took from Husseini are what all of his predecessors have fought and perished for. Devereaux finally submits and then gets arrested. Martial law ends and the detainees, including Haddad's son, are given their freedom.

When Hank, his older, socially challenged brother Jacob and Jacob's friend Lou chase a fox into the woods, they stumble upon a crashed airplane. Hank decides to look inside the plane where he discovers a dead pilot and a bag containing $4.4 million in $100 bills. He suggests turning the money in but is persuaded not to by Jacob and Lou. Hank then proposes that he keep the money safe at his house until the end of winter. Sheriff Carl Jenkins drives by the area and notices the three men after they hide the money in Jacob's pick-up truck. Jacob mentions hearing a plane in the area to avoid suspicion. After Carl leaves, the three men decide to keep the money a secret, but Hank breaks the pact when he reveals the discovery to Sarah.  Sarah suggests that Hank and Jacob return a paltry sum of the money to the plane to avoid suspicion from local authorities. While travelling on foot to the woods, the brothers come across an old man on a snowmobile. Jacob, thinking that their cover is blown, bludgeons him. When the man regains consciousness, Hank suffocates him, then uses the snowmobile to drive his body off a bridge, making the murder look like an accidental death. The following night, Lou drunkenly demands some of the money from Hank, because he has spent recklessly since the discovery. When Hank refuses, Lou threatens to go to the authorities, having learned from Jacob about the old man's murder.  Sarah advises that Hank and Jacob team up to plot against Lou. Much to Jacob's dismay, the two brothers visit Lou at his home where Jacob has him drunkenly confess to the old man's murder. Hank records the false confession with a tape recorder. Lou grows enraged when he realizes that the two have conspired against him and pulls a gun on them. Jacob grabs a rifle from his truck and kills Lou to save his brother. Hank then kills Lou's wife with Lou's shotgun when she appears with another gun. The two brothers avoid arrest after Hank concocts a rehearsed speech for himself and Jacob to tell the police.  Because Jacob mentioned hearing a plane in the woods, Carl asks the brothers to assist an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent, Neil Baxter, in a search for the missing aircraft. Hank and Jacob meet with Baxter and Carl at the police station. Sarah grows skeptical of Baxter, whom she later discovers to be an impostor; she contacts and warns Hank, who steals a revolver from Carl's office. The four men head into the woods and split up. When he finds the plane, Baxter kills Carl, and engages in a gunfight with Hank. Hank manages to kill Baxter with the gun he had stolen. Hank starts to concoct another story to tell the authorities, but Jacob announces that he does not want to live with these bad memories and threatens to commit suicide. Jacob then encourages his brother to kill him instead and frame Baxter for the crime. After grappling with the decision, Hank kills Jacob.  At the police station, Hank tells his rehearsed story to real FBI agents. As Sarah predicted, the agents do not believe that Hank, an upstanding member of the community, would be capable of such wrongdoing. Although he is ruled out as a suspect, Hank is told that the money was part of a ransom and that many of the bills' [[serial number]]s were written down to track the cash. Hank realizes he cannot use the money without being caught. He returns home and burns it all, leaving Sarah distraught. In a closing narration, Hank reflects on his losses. As he tries to move on with his life, the murderous events constantly haunt him.

She does go to the dean, however, but he seems to respond in Clay's favor. Holly took a test after the rape, for further proof, but she made the mistake to first take a shower. Because of this, there is no physical evidence of proof that she was raped.  Holly tries to forget what happened, but Mary is determined that justice is served. She goes to the police, but they can't help her because the university system found Clay innocent. She discovers that last year, there were twenty-six reports of rapes, but only two of them resulted in charges. The mild university system frustrates Mary, and she thinks that Clay is especially treated softly because he is an important quarterback. She confronts him, but he states that Holly wanted to sleep with him and that he turned her down. She soon starts writing an article about the rape, but one of the student reports finds it and shows it to Clay. Not much later she is first attacked by a group of men wearing [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclavas]]. She is convinced Clay is responsible, but they all have alibis.  Meanwhile, Holly starts receiving threat letters and she is almost going over the edge. Mary decides to quit the investigation, but she soon starts to feel as if she has failed.

It doesn't take long for Mary to start reporting again and from there on, the threats start coming again. This time Mary's boyfriend David is the victim, getting hard treatment from his fellow basketball players. Meanwhile, Mary angers the dean by printing an article in which she reveals that most rape reports last year didn't result in charges. As a response, her car is dumped at a nearby lake.  Later, Holly announces she will drop out of college. Clay spots Billy talking to Mary and later gets mad at him. Billy confronts him with the rape, but Clay assures him he isn't guilty. Meanwhile, Mary finds the dress Holly wore on the night of the rape and brings it to the police. It is soon discovered that there are sperm samples on the dress.

Slam (film)
 Raymond "Ray" Joshua (played by [[Saul Williams]]) is a young man growing up in the [[Southeast, Washington, D.C.]] neighborhood of Dodge City, slang for a real Southeast D.C. neighborhood.<sup id="inlinea" class="reference">[[#notea|[A]]]</sup> Despite his innate gift for [[poetry]] and his aspiration to be a [[Rapping|rapper]], he finds it difficult to escape the pressures of his surroundings: violence and drug dealing. While participating in a drug deal gone wrong, Ray's close friend Big Mike is shot. Ray is caught by the police and sent to the [[District of Columbia Department of Corrections]]' central detention facility. He is arraigned for possession of a controlled substance at the [[H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse]] and bail is set at $10,000. When his public defender explains his options ("cop out" and plead guilty), "rock" (stand trial), or "cooperate" (serve as an [[informant]]), Ray despairs, particularly as he is being pressured to participate in a drug culture "inside" very similar to what he was a part of "outside".  Ray takes no sides, unwilling to believe that his options are limited to the choices he is being presented with. When threatened with violence in the prison yard, he retaliates with words, speaking the truths that he's witnessed in the form of a poetic rap meant to show the other inmates how their power and energy is being diverted into petty struggles with each other, rather than being directed toward the system that is keeping them down. In prison, he participates in the writing class of teacher Lauren Bell ([[Sonja Sohn]]), whom he comes to respect and admire. She advises him to pay more attention to his talents.  When Ray is unexpectedly released on bail for a few days prior to his court date by an incarcerated drug dealer whom Ray had inspired with his revolutionary ideas, he is able to convince his friends and their Dodge City crew not to retaliate with more violence for the shooting — to break the cycle instead. He explains that the "[[Public housing|projects]]" where they all live and die are a government experiment and that continuing to kill each other is exactly what those who set up the experiment want them to be doing. On the outside, he also reunites with Bell, and is welcomed into her circle of friends at a poetry reading at her home. They wind up spending the night together, despite her reservations about the future. The next day, she urges him to settle his legal troubles by agreeing to serve a year or two of prison time, rather than fighting the charges and potentially being put away for much longer.  They quarrel, because Ray feels that Bell doesn't understand his situation. He leaves, but shows up that night at a [[poetry slam]] event in D.C.'s [[Cleveland Park]] neighborhood that Bell had invited him to, just in time to see her perform an extremely powerful and empathetic piece that was clearly written for him. When the crowd demands an encore, she invites Ray onto the stage to perform instead, and he delivers an impromptu dramatic poem — scrawled as he crossed the city on public transit on his way to the slam — an emotional piece about black males and the criminal justice system. When the crowd demands an encore, Ray tells Lauren he needs to get some air, then leaves again. He wanders the streets until he is drawn to the [[Washington Monument]].  
Slappy and the Stinkers
 At prestigious private school Dartmoor Academy, [[principal (education)|Principal]] Morgan Brinway is forcing the second-graders to study opera appreciation. Five feisty kids (leader Sonny, contraption making Loaf, movie loving Domino, sympathetic albeit tough Lucy, and the reluctant participating Witz), nicknamed the "Stinkers" by Mr. Brinway, are secretly skipping class to create chaos on the school grounds. Witz becomes the test pilot for a flying chair, one of Sonny's newest ideas. The Stinkers go to Groundskeeper Roy's shed and steal his [[leaf blower]]. Before that, they stole Mr. Brinway's [[desk chair]]. The Stinkers fail to notice that the leaf blower was not entirely duct taped onto the desk chair. When turned it on, the leaf blower flew off the contraption but left Witz sitting in the chair. The leaf blower was heading straight for Mr. Brinway's new convertible, but the leaf blower ran out of gas before it could destroy the car. However, Roy accidentally obliterates the car's side door with his lawn mower's edging blade. Mr. Brinway warns the Stinkers they will be expelled if they mess up one more time, but they soon rebel while trying to keep a low profile and are involved in even more misadventures.  When the kids discover [[sea lion]] Slappy during an [[public aquarium|aquarium]] [[field trip]], Sonny and the others decide to free him by smuggling him back onto the school bus and hide him in Mr. Brinway's [[hot tub]]; as a form of celebrating their success, they have a party. After Mr. Brinway arrives home earlier than usual, the Stinkers retrieve Slappy and hide him at Witz's house. Roy mistakes the sea lion for a giant [[gopher (animal)|gopher]] and sets out to kill him. Animal broker Anthony Boccoli plans to steal Slappy and sell him to a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] [[circus]], but some of his attempts to catch Slappy fail.  The next day, the Stinkers take Slappy with them to the beach so they can set him free, but Slappy refuses to leave. The kids discover there was an [[orca]] (which they assume is Willy from ''[[Free Willy]]'') swimming nearby and that's why Slappy didn't want to go in the water since orcas eat sea lions. Sonny decides they should return Slappy to the aquarium, but they have to first attend a festival at Dartmoor. Roy tries to dispose of Slappy which causes the festival attractions to get ruined. Assuming this was caused by the Stinkers, Mr. Brinway expels them. The Stinkers discover that Boccoli kidnapped Slappy, which prompts the kids to set off on a rescue mission.  The group locates Boccoli's hideout and disposes of him by squirting him with water, blowing [[sawdust]] onto his body and shooting him with Roy's gopher bomb gun. After saving Slappy, the Stinkers get chased by Boccoli. Mr. Brinway and the class go on a hiking field trip to look at birds, which gets interrupted when the Stinkers crash through and Mr. Brinway becomes part of the getaway. After being chased to a [[log flume]], the Stinkers and Mr. Brinway escape Boccoli by going down it; Boccoli tries to drown the group by turning on the flume, but the water is blocked by a [[beaver]]'s nest and once he removes it, a beaver bites him and the water splashes him, causing him to slide down the spillway. The Stinkers, Slappy and Mr. Brinway safely land into the lake below, whereas Boccoli falls onto a floating [[wooden log|log]]. Roy, who is also the school bus driver, ties a rope around Boccoli. Slappy is returned to the aquarium, Mr. Brinway withdraws the Stinkers' expulsion and they become heroes.

Small Soldiers
  Top defense contractor GloboTech Industries acquires the Heartland Toy Company and as part of the move, Globotech CEO Gil Mars tells Heartland toy designers Larry Benson and Irwin Wayfair to develop actual live-action toys capable of "playing back". Mars selects Larry's antagonistic soldiers, the Commando Elite, for the project and Irwin's protagonistic, educational creatures, the Gorgonites, for their enemies, with the toy line expected to hit the market in three months. Faced with such a tight deadline, Benson forgoes safety testing, then uses Irwin's password and chooses GloboTech's X1000 [[microprocessor]] to activate the toys.  Teenager Alan Abernathy signs off for a shipment of the toys at his family's toy store without his father's consent. He and delivery driver Joe activate the leaders for each group – Archer for the Gorgonites and Chip Hazard for the Commando Elite. Alan's neighbor and love interest, Christy Fimple, buys Chip as a birthday present for her brother, Timmy. Alan returns home to discover Archer in his backpack; he realizes Archer is sentient, but in the meantime, the Commando Elite awaken and apparently destroy the Gorgonites in the toy store. Alan calls the company and files a complaint. Later, when Larry and Irwin listen to Alan's voice mail, Irwin is terrified to discover the X1000 was designed for smart munitions guidance; a Globotech engineer reveals the AI circuit is designed to learn over time, but mass production was scrapped due to issues with [[electromagnetic pulse]] shielding.  Meanwhile, Chip and his squad pursue Alan to his home and attempt to kill him and Archer in the kitchen. Unlike the Gorgonites, the Commando Elite do not understand they are ultimately toys. Alan is attacked by Nick Nitro, whom he mortally wounds. His parents, Stuart and Irene, arrive at the kitchen, having been alerted by the sounds of the scuffle there. Alan attempts to explain what is going on, but with Archer not supporting his explanation, neither of his parents believe him. The next day, Alan and Archer find the rest of the Gorgonites in a dumpster at the store. At home, Alan learns that the primary goal of the Gorgonites is to seek their homeland [[Gorgon]], which they mistakenly believe to be in [[Yosemite National Park]]. Through tapping the Abernathys' phone line, the Commando Elite learn of Alan's interest in Christy, immobilize the Fimples' household and take Christy hostage to force Alan into surrendering the Gorgonites.  Alan and Archer sneak into the Fimples' house to save Christy, but run into her Gwendy dolls, whom the Commando Elite engineered as auxiliary troops. The Gwendys quickly subdue Alan. Archer cuts Christy loose from her bonds, and together, they save Alan and destroy the Gwendys before escaping, with the Commando Elite's kit-bashed vehicles in hot pursuit. However, during the chase the Commando Elite suffers a fatal crash. The two teenagers and Archer return to Alan's house, only to find both their families waiting for them, believing that Alan kidnapped Christy and immobilized the Fimples. This time, Stuart and Irene believe Alan and Christy's account of the Gorgonites and the Commando Elite, but Phil and Marion, Christy's parents, remain skeptical. Irwin and Larry arrive and talk to Alan about his voicemail. At that moment, Chip, who survived the chase, attacks the house with a new force of Commando Elites from a hijacked recall shipment by Joe and with more improvised vehicles and weapons, and a battle breaks out between the Commando Elite and the humans inside, cutting off the house's electricity supply.  Inspired by Irwin's advice to create an EMP blast, Alan heads out to force an overload of the power lines. Christy, Irwin, and Larry head to the Fimples' house to turn on all electronic items inside and wedge the power transformers open for a larger surge. At Archer's command, the normally peaceful, heroic Gorgonites emerge and fight back against the evil Commando Elite. Chip flies to the top of the power line pole to stop Alan, where he briefly battles and defeats Archer, but finds himself thrust by Alan into the power line, triggering the EMP blast, which destroys Chip along with all of the remaining Commando Elites.  Mars arrives in his helicopter during the police and fire department cleanup the next day. He pays Joe, the Fimples, and the Abernathys for damages, as well as [[hush money|buying their silence from the media]], and orders Larry and Irwin to prepare the Commando Elite for sale to rebels in [[South America]]. Among the craziness of the aftermath, Alan and Christy part on highly amicable terms, having agreed to start a relationship with each other. Alan later discovers that the Gorgonites have screened themselves from the EMP blast by hiding underneath the Fimples' large [[satellite dish]]. The Abernathys bring the Gorgonites to Yosemite National Park, where Alan sends them out in a large toy boat from his father's store to find their island home of Gorgon.  
SLC Punk!
 The film outlines the daily lives of two punks in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] in the fall of 1985: Stevo and his best friend, "Heroin" Bob; Stevo narrates the film. The nickname "Heroin" is [[Irony|ironic]], as Bob is [[Trypanophobia|afraid of needles]] and actually believes that any drug (with the notable exception of alcohol and cigarettes) is inherently dangerous.  Stevo and Bob go from party to party while living in a dilapidated apartment. They spend much of their time fighting with members of other subcultures, particularly [[rednecks]]. Stevo has a casual relationship with a girl named Sandy, while Heroin Bob is in love with Trish, the manager of a [[head shop]], but reluctant to ask her to become his girlfriend.  The two of them are shaped by their experiences with their parents. Stevo's parents, now divorced, are former hippies who are proud of their youthful endeavors; however, Stevo is revolted by what he perceives as their "selling out" by becoming affluent [[Reagan Republican]]s, which they lamely try to justify. Stevo's grades are excellent, and when his father—a lawyer with a [[Porsche]] and a penchant for younger women—sends an application to [[Harvard Law School]] and Stevo is accepted, he nevertheless rejects it because of his beliefs. By contrast, Bob's father is a paranoid, drunken wreck who mistakes his son and his friend for [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operatives, and chases them away with a shotgun when they visit him on his birthday.  Stevo begins to see the drawbacks of living the punk life. Sean, a fellow punk, is a drug dealer who once attempts to stab his mother while under the influence of an entire 100-dose sheet of acid, before being taken away by the police; Stevo later finds him [[Begging|panhandling]] on the streets with some obvious mental issues.  While Stevo understands that his relationship with Sandy is casual, he's still enraged when he discovers her having sex with another man, and savagely beats him, later loathing himself because his action contradicts his own belief in [[anarchism]]. His social circle begins to drift away, as Mike leaves Salt Lake City to attend the [[University of Notre Dame]]. Stevo falls in love with a young rich girl named Brandy ([[Summer Phoenix]]), who points out that his anarchistic clothing and attitude are more of a fashion choice than an actual political philosophy. Rather than being offended, Stevo takes the criticism thoughtfully and they passionately kiss.  At the same party, Heroin Bob complains of a headache (induced by [[Spandau Ballet]]'s "She Loved Like Diamond" playing on a stereo), and is given [[Percodan]], which he consumes after being told the pills are simply "vitamins" that will help his headache. The accidental [[drug overdose]] kills him in his sleep, seemingly justifying the aversion to chemicals he previously espoused in a diatribe delivered to Stevo. When Stevo discovers that his best friend is dead, he breaks down completely. At the funeral, he appears with a shaved head and changed clothing, and decides that he's done with his punk lifestyle. He decides to go to Harvard, and suggests in the narration that he marries Brandy. He notes in his closing narration that his youthful self would probably kick his future self's ass, wryly describing himself as ultimately just another [[poseur]].  ===The "Tribes"=== The film features several cliques presented as "tribes." The film focuses primarily on the punk tribe, but includes several others as well: * [[Punk subculture|Punk]]s: Stevo, Bob, Sean, Megan, and Mike belong to this tribe, although Mike doesn't dress the part. The punks are rivals of the [[Mod (subculture)|mods]], [[Neo-Nazism|Nazis]] and [[Redneck (stereotype)|rednecks]]. * [[Mod revival|Mods]]: Mods wear suits and ties, and they ride scooters. They're generally the rivals of the punks, but the character John the Mod acts as a diplomat who freely moves between the tribes. In the beginning of the movie, the mods are trying to buy acid from Sean. * [[Redneck]]s: Rednecks are rural Utah folk who wear trucker caps and flannel, and drive around in big trucks. Punks hate them for their conservative views. * [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]]s: Neo-Nazis are [[white power skinhead]]s who wear pseudo-military fatigues and Nazi armbands. Punks and mods are shown to be predatory towards the Nazis. * The [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] Guys: They have long hair and flannel. Not much else is known about them, except that Stevo explains that they are predatory toward the New Wavers. * [[New wave music|New wavers]]: They are people who dress like [[New Romantic]]s and are said to be the least threatening of the tribes. They are described as being "the new [[hippie]]s." Every Tribe is predatory to the New Wavers.  
Smoke Signals (film)
 Victor Joseph ([[Adam Beach]]) and Thomas Builds-the-Fire ([[Evan Adams]]) live on the [[Coeur d'Alene Reservation|Coeur D'Alene Indian Reservation]] in [[Plummer, Idaho|Plummer]], [[Idaho]]. Thomas is an eccentric storyteller and Victor is an angry young man who enjoys playing [[basketball]].  Victor and Thomas are brought together through Victor's father, Arnold ([[Gary Farmer]]). Arnold rescued Thomas as an infant from a house fire that killed his parents. Because of this, Thomas considers him a hero. On the other hand, Victor, who endures Arnold's [[alcoholism]], [[domestic violence]], and eventual [[child abandonment]], regards his father with both deep love and bitter resentment. Thomas and Victor grow up together as neighbors and acquaintances, fighting with each other and simultaneously forming a close, albeit uneasy, alliance.  When Arnold dies in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]], where he has stayed after leaving Victor and his mother Arlene ([[Tantoo Cardinal]]), Victor and Thomas go on an adventure to retrieve his ashes. The trip is the means for Victor and Thomas to explore their identities. Neither of them loses sight of his identity as an "[[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]," but their perspectives differ. Victor is more stoic and Thomas is more traditional (and romantic to the point of watching the feature film ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' countless times). Their dichotomy is portrayed all through the film; it results in Victor being irritated with Thomas, and Thomas being fascinated with Victor.  Once they reach Phoenix, Victor has to confront his conflicted feelings about his father, as well as his own identity. He has to grapple with a new account of Thomas's parents' death, as told by his father's friend, Suzy Song ([[Irene Bedard]]). She says that a drunken Arnold set off fireworks, accidentally starting the fire that cost Thomas his parents. The road trip by the young men leads to Thomas reconciling with the memory of his adoptive father Arnold, as he understands more of his path to alcoholism and related abuse and abandonment. Victor also gains a better understanding of Thomas and his reverence for Arnold.  
Slums of Beverly Hills
 Fourteen-year-old Vivian Abromowitz's family are penniless nomads, moving from one cheap apartment to another in [[Beverly Hills]] in 1976, so that Vivian ([[Natasha Lyonne]]) and her brothers can attend the city's prestigious [[Beverly Hills Unified School District|schools]]. Their father, Murray ([[Alan Arkin]]), is a divorced 65-year-old who refuses to [[retire]], working as an unsuccessful [[Oldsmobile]] salesman whose cars are selling poorly due in large part to the [[Energy crisis]] of the time.  Vivian's wealthy uncle Mickey ([[Carl Reiner]]) regularly sends the family money to help them survive. When Mickey's 29-year-old daughter Rita ([[Marisa Tomei]]) runs away from a rehab facility, Murray offers her shelter if Mickey will pay for a plush apartment. Vivian must babysit her adult cousin, making sure she gets to nursing school and avoids pills and booze. But Vivian has her own problems: she's curious about sex, likes an apparently twenty-something neighbor, Eliot ([[Kevin Corrigan]]), has inherited her mother's ample breasts, and wants a family that doesn't embarrass her.  Vivian's older brother Ben ([[David Krumholtz]]) aspires to a show business career, while her dad aspires to feminine companionship but won't give in to wealthy lady-friend Doris Zimmerman's ([[Jessica Walter]]) desire that he send his kids back East to live with his ex-wife. Vivian's younger brother Rickey ([[Eli Marienthal]]) simply aspires to get attention.  Vivian and Rita are close and speak sometimes in [[gibberish (language game)|their own invented language]]. Vivian learns that Rita has no desire to attend nursing school and also has no clue as to what to do with her life. Murray attempts to cover up Rita's lack of progress at nursing school, when Mickey asks for progress reports. Eventually, Mickey, frustrated at having to support his brother's family and also learning of their deception concerning his daughter (who is pregnant), explodes during a meeting between the two families, telling Murray he's tired of sending them money. Depressed and dejected, Murray once again packs the kids into his car and they take off. In an attempt to cheer her father up, Vivian suggests that the family stop for steak for breakfast—a ritual regularly shared by the family as a means of cheering themselves up.  
Snake Eyes (film)
 On a dark and stormy night, corrupt, flamboyant [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] police detective Rick Santoro ([[Nicolas Cage]]) attends a [[boxing]] match at Gilbert Powell's ([[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]]) Atlantic City Arena between heavyweight champion Lincoln Tyler ([[Stan Shaw]]) and challenger Jose Pacifico Ruiz. He meets up with his best friend since childhood, Kevin Dunne ([[Gary Sinise]]), who is a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Commander (United States)#Naval|Commander]] working with the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to escort [[United States Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] Charles Kirkland ([[Joel Fabiani]]) and Powell at the fight after a trip to [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Virginia]].   As the first round begins, Kevin is distracted by an attractive redhead named Serena ([[Jayne Heitmeyer]]) who wears a ruby ring, and leaves his seat, which is then taken by Julia Costello ([[Carla Gugino]]), a mysterious woman with [[Blonde hair|platinum blonde]] hair and a white [[satin]] suit. When Tyler is unexpectedly knocked out by Ruiz, gunshots ring out, mortally wounding Kirkland and grazing Julia, who loses her glasses and blonde wig, revealing her naturally dark hair. Kevin kills the sniper and orders the arena to be locked down. Despite the lockdown, Julia escapes into the [[casino]], covers her wounds in pieces of cloth from her blouse and, after stealing a black satin jacket, disguises herself as a hooker.  Rick notices that the "knocked out" Tyler woke up instantly when the shots rang out and, after studying the fight tape, realizes the knockout punch didn't connect. Tyler confesses that he threw the fight in order to pay gambling debts, but he was never told that anyone would be killed and reveals that he was paid to take a dive by Serena, the redhead who tricked Kevin into leaving his post. With the involvement of Tyler, Serena and the sniper - in addition to the man who signaled Tyler to go down and whoever gave him the go-ahead - Rick suspects a conspiracy and reveals everything he has learned to Kevin. The commander confesses that the trip to Norfolk was for a test of the AirGuard missile defense system, which Powell's company was backing. He deduces that the sniper, a known [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] terrorist named Tariq Rabat, assassinated Kirkland over the Pentagon's large-scale defense cooperation with and weapons systems transfers to Israel.   Rick studies surveillance footage to find Serena while, with the help of Powell's security guards, Kevin continues his search for Julia. However, once they split up, it is revealed that Kevin is actually the fifth party and mastermind of the conspiracy. He kills the now-blonde Serena and Zietz (the man who signaled Tyler to go down) in order to prevent their further involvement With the help of his bodyguards. Kevin then enlists Tyler by revealing the truth to him.  Julia seduces Ned Campbell ([[David Anthony Higgins]]), a sleazy guest at the hotel, so she can hide in his room. Both Rick and Kevin discover this at the same time and give chase, but the detective reaches her first and takes her into protective custody. In a stairwell, Julia confesses that she is an analyst who worked on the AirGuard tests and discovered the results were faked to make the missile defense system look like it was working when it was actually way off; the system failed to work and she tipped off Kirkland to the deception. However, Kevin learned of her actions and arranged the entire conspiracy to kill both her and Kirkland, using Rabat's background as a rabidly anti-Israel terrorist to have him kill the SECDEF and then be immediately killed off himself. Rick learns of Kevin's involvement and, despite his initial refusal to believe it, quickly accepts the truth. After hiding Julia in a warehouse, Rick inspects the footage of a new floating camera and discovers proof of his friend's involvement.   Kevin confronts Rick and confesses that his motive was to prevent any further attacks on U.S. ships, similar to the one where he had to witness several sailors drown. He offers Rick one million dollars for Julia's location. When Rick refuses, Kevin has Tyler beat him up, but he still does not give in. Kevin plants a tracker on Rick and follows him to the warehouse just as a [[hurricane]] hits Atlantic City. When a tidal wave hits the [[boardwalk]], Rick uses it as cover to rush Julia outside, where the police, tipped off by Rick, are waiting and witness the Navy officer opening fire. Cornered by the police and a news crew with no way out, Kevin commits suicide in view of the live news feed.  Rick is later hailed as a hero, but the press soon uncovers his corruption and he loses his job and family. Before reporting for his prison term, Rick meets Julia on the boardwalk. She thanks him for his help, as Powell is completely restructuring his company and scrapping the AirGuard. Rick promises to call when he gets out in twelve to eighteen months. Ultimately, Serena's ruby ring is seen embedded in one of the concrete pillars of the new Powell Millennium Arena, revealing it as her final resting place.  
Sliding Doors
 Helen Quilley ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]) gets fired from her [[public relations]] job. As she leaves the office building, she drops an earring in the lift and a man picks it up for her. She rushes for her train on the [[London Underground]] and misses it. The plot then splits into two storylines, presented as [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]s, in which different events ensue, consequent upon whether or not she catches a particular train.  In the timeline in which she boards the train, Helen sits alongside James ([[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]]) (the man in the lift) on the Underground and they strike up a conversation. She gets home in time to catch her boyfriend, Gerry ([[John Lynch (actor)|John Lynch]]), in bed with his American ex-girlfriend, Lydia ([[Jeanne Tripplehorn]]). Helen dumps him and moves in with her friend Anna ([[Zara Turner]]), and, at Anna's suggestion, she changes her hairstyle to make a fresh start. James continues to [[Serendipity|serendipitously]] pop into Helen's life, cheering her up and encouraging her to start her own public relations firm. She and James fall in love despite her reservations about beginning another relationship so soon after her ugly breakup with Gerry. Eventually, Helen discovers that she is pregnant. Believing it is James's child, she goes to see him at his office. She is stunned to learn from James's secretary that he is married. Upset, she disappears. James finds her on a bridge and explains that he ''was'' married but is now separated and planning a divorce. He and his soon-to-be-ex-wife maintain the appearance of a happy marriage for the sake of his sick mother. After she and James declare their love, Helen walks out into the road and is hit by a van.  In the timeline in which Helen misses the train, subsequent services are delayed; she exits the station and hails a taxi. A man tries to snatch her handbag and injures her, so she goes to the hospital. She arrives home after Lydia has left and she remains oblivious to Gerry's infidelity. Unable to find another PR job, she takes two part-time jobs to pay the bills. Gerry continues to juggle the two women in his life. Lydia, wanting Gerry for herself, makes increasingly aggressive attempts to torment Helen and dropping clues of their affair to her. Helen suspects Gerry of infidelity but later discovers that she is pregnant. She receives a phone call, allegedly for a job interview with an international PR firm. She tells Gerry the news but does not manage to tell him of her pregnancy. Lydia calls Gerry to her apartment, apparently to break up. Thinking Helen is at her interview, Gerry goes to see Lydia. While at Lydia's, Gerry answers the doorbell and sees Helen standing at the door. Helen is stunned to see Gerry, and Lydia drops the news of her own pregnancy to both. Distraught, Helen runs off and falls down Lydia's staircase.  In both storylines, Helen is taken to hospital and loses her baby. In the timeline where she originally boarded the train, she dies in the arms of her new-found love, James, right after he says he will make her very happy; in the timeline in which she missed it, she recovers and tells Gerry to leave for good.  In the final scene (taking place in the "missed train" timeline), James leaves the hospital after visiting his mother, and Helen leaves after ending her relationship with Gerry. They meet in the lift, and Helen drops an earring which is picked up by James, as in their first encounter at the beginning of the film. Before the lift doors close, James tells Helen to cheer up and repeats his line: "You know what the [[Monty Python]] boys say..."  Helen (who had previously assumed the rejoinder to be "[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|always look on the bright side of life]]") says, "[[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition]]." The frame freezes as she and James stare at one another.

So Close to Paradise
  ''So Close to Paradise'' takes place in the 1980s in the central Chinese city of [[Wuhan]]. The film follows two young migrant workers. Young innocent '''Dong Zi''' ([[Shi Yu]]) is a pole carrier or [[coolie]] eking out a meager existence carrying heavy loads from place to place. His friend and roommate '''Gao Ping''' ([[Guo Tao (actor)|Guo Tao]]) is from the same home village, but unlike Dong Zi, is older, more cynical, and has fallen into a life of petty crime. As the film begins, Gao has been cheated out of a small amount of money from a local gangster '''Su Wu''' ([[Wu Tao (actor)|Wu Tao]]). Enraged, Gao drags his friend into Wuhan's underworld. Their first stop is a local bar, the Li Li Club where they go looking for '''Ruan Hong''' ([[Wang Tong]]), a Vietnamese singer who is said to know Su Wu. After speaking with her, Gao and Dong kidnap the young woman and drag her to their apartment. Gao asks Dong to leave the room after which he proceeds to rape her, while Dong peers through a crack in the door. Soon afterwards, however, Gao and Ruan suddenly become lovers, much to Dong Zi's surprise and consternation.  As Gao and Ruan continue their relationship, Dong Zi becomes sullen and seemingly jealous, though it is unclear of whom. Later Ruan and Gao appear to get in a fight as Gao Ping continues to obsess over the small amount of money he has lost. Enraged, Ruan leaves the apartment with a curious Dong Zi in tow. The two talk throughout the night and Ruan reveals that she only wants to become a professional singer, though such dreams seem out of reach. She eventually returns to the apartment, but only to leave the phone number of Su Wu.  Upon finding Su Wu, Gao beats and imprisons Su in a cellar before releasing him, after Su agrees to take him to his boss. What happens next is not shown on screen, though Dong Zi narrating explains that Gao Ping somehow became caught up in a scheme with Su Wu and his boss, leading to Gao murdering an unknown person. Tensions rise, however, when it is discovered that Ruan Hong is the kept woman of Su Wu's boss. Realizing the danger, Gao Ping disappears just as the boss and the police begin to close in on him. Secretly communicating with Ruan, Gao promises to take her away but fails to show up on the appointed day. Ruan is subsequently arrested when the Li Li Club is seized as a den of [[Prostitution in China|prostitution]]. When Gao finally comes back to his apartment, he is caught by the Boss whose men beat him to death.  The film then ends as Ruan, now released from prison, returns to the apartment of Dong Zi and Gao Ping. For Dong Zi, she is the only person he knows in the city. They reminisce of the dead Gao, and Ruan thanks Dong Zi for "kidnapping" her that night. Before she leaves, Dong Zi gives her a [[walkman]] with a tape of one of her songs.  
Soldier (1998 American film)
 In 1996, as part of a new military training program, orphaned infants are selected at birth and raised as highly disciplined soldiers dedicated to a wholly military routine. They are trained to be ruthless obedient killers without any moral code of conduct, and any deemed physically or mentally unworthy are executed. Survivors of the training program are turned into impassive, dedicated fighting machines with no exposure to or understanding of the outside world.  In 2036, at the age of 40, Sgt. Todd 3465 is a battle-hardened veteran and the best soldier of the original 1996 infants. Colonel Mekum, the leader of the original project, introduces a new group of genetically engineered soldiers, designed with superior physical attributes and a complete lack of emotion except unparalleled aggression.  Captain Church, the commander of Todd's unit, insists on testing the abilities of the new soldiers against those of his proven older ones. The new soldiers outperform the old soldiers in every way. In a combat exercise held at the top of climbing chains, a new soldier, Caine 607, easily defeats two of the original soldiers before Todd gouges out Caine's eye. Caine knocks Todd from the top of the chains; though he is presumed dead, the body of another dead soldier actually cushioned his fall and he is simply stunned and knocked unconscious. Mekum classifies it as a training exercise gone wrong and orders their bodies disposed of like garbage. Declared obsolete by Mekum, the remaining older soldiers are removed from combat duty and demoted to menial unarmed support roles.  Dumped on Arcadia 234, a waste disposal planet, an injured Todd limps toward a colony whose residents crash-landed there years earlier; as they were believed dead, no rescue missions have been attempted. Todd is found and sheltered by Mace, and he and his wife Sandra help nurse Todd back to health. Rarely speaking himself, Todd develops a silent rapport with their mute son, Nathan, who had been traumatized by a snakebite as an infant. He looks upon the happy, loving family with yearning in his eyes; having never considered sexuality before, he also has confusion concerning an attraction to Sandra. Though they try to make him feel welcome, Todd has difficulty adapting to the community and their conflict-free lives due to his extremely rigid conditioning. When Nathan silently looks to him for defense against a coiled snake, Todd attempts to show Nathan how to protect himself. Nathan's parents intervene and disapprove of the lesson, unsure of how to deal with the silent soldier. Todd's increasing disorientation by exposure to peaceful civilian life manifests into [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] of his time battling other soldiers - and killing civilians who were in the way. With Todd's mind deep inside one of his more violent memories, one of the colonists surprises Todd, who nearly kills him. Fearful, the colonists expel Todd from the community. Having been rejected by every society he has known - the military and the refugee civilians - Todd shows strong emotion for the first time; overcome by the loss, he quietly cries. A short time later, Mace and Sandra are almost bitten by a snake while they sleep, but Nathan uses Todd's defensive technique and saves them. Now understanding the value of Todd's lesson, Mace leaves to bring him back, regardless of the opposition of the colonists who fear him.  Mekum and the new soldiers arrive on the garbage planet to garner them combat experience. Since the world is listed as uninhabited, Mekum declares the colonists as hostiles to be used as the targets, much to the disapproval of Captain Church. Just after Mace finds Todd and apologizes, the soldiers spot them and open fire. Todd survives but Mace dies from the attack. Though out-manned and outgunned, Todd's years of battle experience and superior knowledge of the planet allow him to return to the colony and kill the advance squad. Nervous that an unknown enemy force may be confronting them, Colonel Mekum orders the soldiers to withdraw and return with heavy artillery. Using guerrilla tactics, Todd outmaneuvers and kills all the remaining soldiers. Caine 607 is wounded and uses painkillers and performance enhancing stimulants to attack Todd in vicious hand-to-hand combat, but he is ultimately defeated by Todd's experience and clever tactics rather than mere physical prowess.  Todd confronts Mekum over the radio, declaring his new soldiers obsolete. Panicking, Mekum orders Todd's old squad to set up and activate a portable nuclear device powerful enough to destroy the planet before commanding the ship to lift off and leave the squad behind. When Captain Church objects to the abandonment of the old soldiers, Mekum shoots him in cold blood. Todd finds his old squad and they silently side with him over the army that has discarded them. They take over the ship, evacuate the remaining colonists and leave Mekum and Church's aides on the planet. In an attempt to disarm the nuclear device, Mekum accidentally sets it off, killing himself and the aides. The ship escapes the shockwave and sets course for the Trinity Moons, the colonists' original destination. When Nathan enters the control room and reaches for Todd, he picks up Nathan and points to their new destination while looking out upon the galaxy.

In the meanwhile, Jojo becomes so jealous of Vicky's ability to steal his lover/fiancee that he destroys Vicky's apartment and to take revenge, Vicky storms into Jojo's father Baldev's household, kills many of his henchmen, and makes him cough up the money for the damage Jojo did to his apartment.   Baldev reports this to his brother Virender, who orders Vicky killed ASAP. Hence, Baldev and Jojo hire a sniper to kill Vicky, who is receiving his mother at the airport. They discover that his mother is none other than Virender's estranged wife, Shanti ([[Farida Jalal]]). Convinced that Vicky is  Virender's son, the assassination attempt is called off. Vicky is then welcomed into Virender's gang. After a few months of getting to know Vicky personally, Virender takes Vicky to a place where he keeps Pratabh, Jaswant, and DK's secrets in files.   Vicky seizes the moment and he shoots Virender dead and dumps him into the bay where a shark eats him. He then plants Pratabh's signature cigarette lighter at the crime scene to frame him as the murderer. Vicky then goes through the stolen files and discovers who DK actually is.   The police retrieve Pratabh's lighter from Virender's crime scene and hand it over to Vicky, who shows the planted evidence to his brother, Baldev Sinha  to rally his henchmen and launch an attack on Pratabh.   The entire squad sent by Baldev is gunned down at a check post by Pratabh's men, save for Vicky, who was working with Pratabh to get rid of Virender's gang.   Vicky then reveals to Pratabh that he is not Virender's son, and that he had become Shanti's foster son (adopted son) since she had lost her own. He also reveals that he was sent on a secret mission by DK to kill Jaswant, Virender and Pratabh, and that they should leave for India to kill DK, to make Pratabh  the undisputed crime king, to which Pratabh agrees and starts preparing for travel to India.   Meanwhile, Preeti overhears Vicky's conversation with her father and reveals it all to Shanti. Shanti calmly acknowledges that she knows Vicky is not her son and that she had assisted him kill her husband, whose weapons had accidentally killed her own son, unbeknownst to him. She reveals that Vicky is late Major Vijay Malhotra's son, Raju. Raju's father was mercilessly stripped of all medals and his wife, Geeta ([[Raakhee]]) and son were ostracised by his community. The community even prevented his body from being cremated and left it in a raging desert storm, where it is lost in the sands. Preeti, upon hearing this story, agrees to assist Raju/Vicky.   Raju then calls Inspector Dinesh and reveals his plan of bringing Pratap to India and his knowledge of DK's true identity.   Then Inspector Dinesh releases Jaswant, who is revealed to be alive and had been helping provide Raju the information to finish off Virender's gang.  Raju arrives in India with Pratap and takes him to his village, where his mother sits desolately in a temple at the village outskirts. He reveals to Pratap  that he is Raju (the late major Malhtora<nowiki>''</nowiki>s son) and proceeds to beat him up. DK comes to rescue Pratap, and he is revealed to be none other than Jaswant.   Soon Jaswant/DK's men arrive and in the raging battle, Raju kills all the men with help from the police, and Inspector Dinesh and holds up Pratap and DK, makes them confess the truth, and then leaves them for the vultures to feed upon.  His name cleared, the late Major Vijay Malhotra is given an honourable military burial, and his son Raju/Vicky and widowed wife, and Preeti are finally happy that justice was served.

Star Trek: Insurrection
 Lieutenant Commander [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] ([[Brent Spiner]]) is temporarily transferred to an undercover mission observing the peaceful [[List of Star Trek races#Ba'ku|Ba'ku]] people. While on their planet, he malfunctions and reveals the presence of the joint [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]]–Son'a task force observing the Ba'ku. Admiral Matthew Dougherty ([[Anthony Zerbe]]) contacts the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|USS ''Enterprise''-E]] to obtain Data's schematics but adamantly states the presence of the ''Enterprise'' is not needed. Captain Picard decides to ignore these orders and takes the ''Enterprise'' to capture Data.  After stopping Data, Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) becomes suspicious of Dougherty's insistence that the ''Enterprise'' is no longer needed. His crew investigates the cause of Data's malfunction. They discover that the Ba'ku have advanced technology, but have rejected its use to live simpler lives. Due to unique radiation or "metaphasic particles" emanating from their planet's rings, they are effectively immortal. Dougherty's allies, the Son'a, are a decrepit race who use medical techniques to prevent death; their excessive use of [[Rhytidectomy|cosmetic surgery]] gives them a mummified appearance. The ''Enterprise'' crew also begin to experience the rejuvenation effects of the planet: Lt. Commander [[Geordi La Forge]] ([[LeVar Burton]]) finds his eyes have regenerated and he no longer requires ocular implants; Commander [[William Riker]] ([[Jonathan Frakes]]) and Counselor [[Deanna Troi]] ([[Marina Sirtis]]) rekindle their long-abandoned relationship; and Picard develops a romantic relationship with the Ba'ku woman Anij ([[Donna Murphy]]).  Data and Picard discover a submerged and cloaked Federation ship containing a gigantic [[holodeck]] set up to recreate the Ba'ku village. Data's malfunction stems from a Son'a attack, received when he discovered the vessel. Picard confronts Dougherty and learns that top Federation officers and the Son'a secretly planned to deceptively move the Ba'ku to the ship and forcibly relocate them to another planet, allowing the Son'a to collect the rejuvenating radiation (but poisoning the planet in the process). Dougherty orders the ''Enterprise'' to leave. Picard states the rejuvenation benefit of the radiation does not justify Dougherty's plans for the Ba'ku and violates the [[Prime Directive]]. He plans to alert the Federation of the forced relocation.  Picard is joined by some of his crew to help the Ba'ku escape from being abducted while Riker takes the ''Enterprise'' to a transmission range and communicate the violation to Star Fleet. The Son'a send robotic probes to locate and capture the fleeing Ba'ku. The Son'a leader, Ahdar Ru'afo ([[F. Murray Abraham]]), convinces Dougherty to allow two Son'a ships to attack the ''Enterprise''. Riker defeats the attacking ships and the ''Enterprise'' escapes. Their plan exposed, Ru'afo insists upon harvesting the radiation source immediately. Picard, Anij, and several Ba'ku are transported as prisoners onto the Son'a ship. Picard reveals to Dougherty that the Son'a and the Ba'ku are the same race and involving the Federation in a blood feud. The Son'a are a splinter faction of Ba'ku who gave up their bucolic existence a century earlier to embrace the use of technology. They attempted to seize power but failed, and the Ba'ku elders exiled them from the planet, denying them the rejuvenating effects of the rings. The Son'a developed an artificial and imperfect means to extend their lives at the cost of disfigurement. Ru'afo kills Admiral Dougherty when he backs out of the plan and Ru'afo proceeds with his plan.  While Picard is escorted to be executed, he convinces the Son'a Gallatin ([[Gregg Henry]]) to help him stop Ru'afo. Picard masterminds a ruse to transport Ru'afo and his bridge crew to the holoship and shutdown the harvester. Ru'afo discovers the deception and transports to the radiation harvester ship to manually restart the process. Picard follows and sets the harvester to self-destruct, which kills Ru'afo while Picard is rescued by the ''Enterprise''. The remaining Son'a are forgiven and welcomed back by the Ba'ku. Picard arranges a meeting between Gallatin and his Ba'ku mother. The ''Enterprise'' crew take a moment to enjoy their rejuvenated selves before returning to their previous mission.  
Species II
 Three years after the events of the [[Species (film)|previous film]], Commander Patrick Ross leads a manned mission to [[Mars]]. Soil samples collected by Patrick's team of [[astronaut]]s unwittingly contain an extraterrestrial substance which thaws aboard their capsule due to the temperature difference and contaminates them, causing a seven-minute contact gap with [[mission control]]. With seemingly no subsequent negative effects, the astronauts return to Earth to public celebration. Only an institutionalized former scientist, Dr. Cromwell, reacts to their return with violent panic. Meanwhile, Dr. Laura Baker has created a clone of Sil named Eve, whose alien DNA is suppressed to make her more docile. Her team conducts experiments on Eve, hoping to find a way to combat the alien species should it ever return to Earth. Every experiment is unsuccessful as Eve's biology adapts.  Upon their return, Patrick and his team are told to refrain from sexual activity for ten days. Patrick disregards this advice and has a [[threesome]] with two sisters following a fundraiser. During sex with the second woman, he begins to sprout tentacles. The lady notices his transformation while she is stroking his body and is horrified at the sight of him whereupon she tries to free herself from his clutches. Both mothers experience accelerated pregnancies, culminating when Patrick's half-alien children violently explode from their abdomens. Patrick hides both corpses and his rapidly growing sons on the property of his father, [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] Judson Ross. The next day, Patrick tells his father he cannot remember the previous night's events. Senator Ross indicates that he is aware of Patrick's behavior and tells him to focus on his political goals.  Dr. Orinsky, one of the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] scientists who examined Patrick, discovers something amiss about his blood sample and desperately tries to contact Cromwell. However, Orinsky is ambushed and disemboweled by an alien Patrick, who snuck into the labs. Laura discovers that the DNA in Orinsky's wounds is distinct from Eve's, prompting Colonel Burgess, the military supervisor in charge of her project, to reunite her with Press Lennox to contain the new threat. Press and Laura seek out Cromwell, Orinsky's former professor, and learn that he discovered that the alien species had attacked and destroyed Mars in ancient times. Because of his fears that alien DNA might remain on Mars to infect anyone who visited the planet in the future, Cromwell urged the government to abort the mission, but was institutionalized to permanently silence him.  Press and Laura report their findings to Burgess, identifying the Mars astronauts as the prime suspects. Unable to find Patrick, they pursue the other astronauts, Anne Sampas and Dennis Gamble. They arrive too late to prevent Anne from having sex with her husband, resulting in her impregnation with hybrid offspring. The tentacle-like creature bursts from Anne's abdomen and kills her husband before Press and Laura manage to kill it while Anne dies of her injuries. Meanwhile, a second team of government agents locate and examine the third astronaut, Dennis Gamble, but confirm he is not infected. Laura discovers that Anne's hybrid DNA does not match that in Orinsky's wounds, meaning Patrick is the killer. Meanwhile, Patrick has sex with his fiancée, resulting in her death and the birth of another hybrid son. Horrified at causing the woman's death, Patrick attempts suicide by shotgun, but the alien DNA regenerates his head and restores him back to life—with the drive to mate with as many women as possible. Dennis witnesses this and tells Press and Laura what he saw, remembers what happened in the capsule and joining them in their mission. Patrick begins impregnating as many women as he can, hiding his victims and up to twenty children at the shed.  Laura is ordered to activate Eve's alien DNA so she can telepathically track Patrick, but this makes her volatile and strengthens her alien instincts. Patrick surrenders to Press and Dennis after attempting to rape a woman at a parking lot of a supermarket, whereupon Patrick becomes aware of Eve; they take him to the lab despite dubious of his submission. As Patrick is taken to custody, Eve shows signs of being in heat. He demands Laura open Eve's cell and nearly kills her when she refuses, but Press and Dennis drive him off with a special gaseous weapon. Burgess confronts Senator Ross with proof of Patrick's infection and demands help in detaining Patrick. Suspicious that Patrick will instead be killed, Ross deduces that he is at the shed and apologizes for treating his son so coldly. Patrick's human side briefly returns, but while he tearfully embraces his father, the alien DNA violently reasserts itself and kills the Senator. Ross's death completely destroys Patrick's humanity, and he helps his hybrid children to cocoon, so they will soon mature and begin mating themselves, preparing them to eradicate humanity.  Back at the lab, Laura discovers Dennis was not infected because he is a carrier of [[sickle-cell disease]], as the species lacks immunity to human genetic diseases. While they plan to weaponise this weakness, Eve breaks out of her confinement to find Patrick. Press, Laura and Dennis pursue her, with Burgess and the military following. At the shed, they kill Patrick's offspring while Eve and Patrick transform into their alien forms and begin to mate. The mating stops when Press and Dennis intervene, allowing Eve to break free; Patrick overpowers Eve by performing fellatio, apparently killing her. Press impales him in the back with a pitchfork coated in Dennis' blood, causing Patrick to disintegrate and die.  The military escorts Press, Laura and the injured Dennis away. Eve's lifeless body is loaded into an ambulance, but shortly after, her womb begins to swell rapidly—indicating her survival and impregnation by Patrick—while one of his youngest sons, who somehow survived, watches. As the screen cuts to black, Eve's uterus bursts and her screaming is heard.  
Sphere (1998 film)
 An alien spacecraft is discovered on the floor of the [[Pacific Ocean]], estimated to have been there for nearly 300 years. A team of experts, including marine biologist Dr. Beth Halperin (Stone), mathematician Dr. Harry Adams (Jackson), astrophysicist Dr. Ted Fielding (Schreiber), psychologist Dr. Norman Goodman (Hoffman), and [[U.S. Navy]] Capt. Harold Barnes (Coyote), are assembled and taken to the Habitat, a state-of-the-art living environment located near the spacecraft.  Upon examination of the spacecraft, they determine that it is not alien at all, but rather U.S. in origin. However, its technology far surpasses any in the present day. The ship's computer logs cryptically suggest either a mission originating in the distant past or future, but the team manages to deduce that the long dead crew were tasked with collecting an item of scientific importance. Goodman and Halperin discover the ship's logs, which show the ship encountering an "unknown event" (thought to be a [[black hole]]) that sends the vessel back in time. Goodman and the others eventually stumble upon a large, perfect sphere hovering a few feet above the floor in the ship's cargo bay. They cannot find any way to probe the inside of the sphere, and the fluidic surface is impenetrable; the crew attaches importance to the fact that the sphere reflects its surroundings but not the humans.  They return to the Habitat, and Harry comes to believe that everyone on this team is fated to die. His rationale is that the black hole is referred to as an "unknown event" in the logs but due to time travel they have foreknowledge of the entire mission. During the night, Harry returns to the spacecraft and is able to enter the sphere, then returns to the Habitat. The next day, the crew discovers a series of numeric-encoded messages appearing on the computer screens; the crew is able to decipher them and come to believe they are speaking to "Jerry", an alien intelligence from the sphere. They find Jerry is able to see and hear everything that happens on the Habitat.  A powerful [[typhoon]] strikes the surface, and the Habitat crew are forced to stay several more days. During that time, a series of tragedies strike the crew, including attacks from aggressive [[jellyfish]] and a [[giant squid]] and equipment failures in the base, killing Ted and the team's support staff. The survivors, Beth, Harry, and Norman believe Jerry to be responsible. While waiting for rescue, the three realize that the hazards are manifestations of their own fears - all of them have entered the sphere, which has given them the ability to make their imagination real. Norman discovers that they had misinterpreted the initial messages from Jerry and that the entity speaking to them through the computers is actually Harry himself, transmitted while he is asleep.   Under the stress of the situation, Beth has suicidal thoughts which causes the detonation mechanisms on a store of explosives to engage, threatening to destroy the base and the spacecraft. They race to the Habitat's mini-sub, but their combined fears cause them to re-appear back in the spacecraft. As a psychologist, Norman is able to see through the illusion.  He triggers the mini-sub's undocking process and overrides the others' fears that they will not escape the destruction of the Habitat and spacecraft. The sphere is untouched by the explosions.  The mini-sub makes it to the surface as the surface ships return. As Beth, Harry, and Norman begin safe [[Decompression chamber|decompression]], they realize that they will be debriefed and their newfound powers discovered. They all agree to erase their memories of the event using their powers; this assures that the "unknown event" paradox is resolved. The sphere rises from the ocean and then accelerates off into space.

Stepmom (film)
 Jackie and Luke Harrison are a [[divorce]]d [[New York City]] couple struggling to help their children Anna and Ben be happy with this sudden change of lifestyle. Luke, an [[Lawyer|attorney]], is living with his new girlfriend, Isabel Kelly, a successful fashion photographer several years his junior.<ref>http://nyulocal.com/entertainment/2010/10/28/some-of-the-best-fictional-nyu-characters/</ref> Isabel tries hard to make Anna and Ben feel comfortable and happy with her, but Anna repeatedly rejects her overtures while Ben, who is generally kind to Isabel, adds extra complication with his mischievous nature. Isabel behaves with contempt tempered by caution around Jackie, believing she overcompensates for her divorce by spoiling her children.  Jackie, a former [[publisher]] turned [[stay-at-home mom]], gives Isabel a cold reception, seeing her as an overly ambitious career woman. She also continues to harbor malice towards Luke, as seen in a confrontation about Isabel. After a long string of arguments and hurt feelings involving Isabel, Jackie, and Anna, Luke proposes to Isabel, making her Anna and Ben's soon-to-be official [[stepmother]]. This causes even more friction. Jackie is diagnosed with [[lymphoma]], which is discovered to be terminal. She experiences a range of negative emotions, angry at the woman who she feels was responsible for breaking up her family, and angry that after all of the sacrifices she made for her family, she will never see her children grow up. Jackie actively sabotages Isabel's effort to bond with the children even to the point of refusing to allow her to take Anna to see a rock band that she likes and then taking her to the same concert a few weeks later herself.  Luke and Jackie later tell the children about the engagement, and Anna is furious. Jackie tells Luke and the children about her illness, resulting in Anna storming out. That night Jackie shows that she can be fun by dancing and singing with Anna and Ben.  Isabel and Anna continue to clash. Isabel gets the children a [[golden retriever]] puppy, and Anna says that she is allergic to dogs. Surprised, Isabel apologizes and says that her father didn't tell her that. After another argument between the two, Anna takes the dog inside her room, indicating she lied about her allergy. Eventually, Isabel and Anna's relationship improves. They start to bond over painting, when Isabel teaches Anna how to paint trees.  Jackie and Isabel disagree repeatedly, largely over Isabel's parenting. Ben goes missing on Isabel's watch and Jackie claims that she has never lost him, which she later admits to be untrue. When Anna has problems with a boy she once liked, the two women give opposite advice, causing more tension between Jackie and Isabel. They manage to establish a shaky truce, as they come to terms that Isabel will soon step into the role of a surrogate mother. The two women finally bond when Isabel reveals her admiration of Jackie's maternal instincts, while Jackie in turn praises Isabel's hipness as a means to connect with Anna. Isabel finally lets her guard down when she tells Jackie her biggest fear is that on Anna's wedding day, all Anna will wish for is her mother's presence. Jackie says her own fear is that Anna will forget her. Jackie explains to Isabel that, while Jackie will always have their past, Isabel will have their future.  The film ends with the family celebrating Christmas. Jackie, who is bedridden, is visited in her room by Ben and Anna. Individually, Jackie tells her children that though she will die, she will remain with them as long as they remember her. Later that day, Isabel is taking a family portrait of Luke and Jackie with the children. Jackie demonstrates her acceptance of Isabel by inviting her to join them, stating "let's get a photo with the whole family". Isabel does, and as the closing credits begin, both women are shown happily in a photo side by side, finally at peace with one another and with future events ahead of them (Jackie's death and Isabel's marriage to Luke).  
The Storm Riders
 The evil Lord Conqueror, head of Conqueror's Clan, is given a prophecy by Mud Buddha when quizzed about his delayed duel with Sword Saint. The prophecy translates that if Conqueror finds two young children by the name of Wind and Cloud he will have good fortune. Mud Buddha provides the birth charts of these two and gives him a puzzle box stating that finding Wind and Cloud is but one half of his destiny, the box will provide him with the latter half once he unlocks it. Conqueror issues an order that every boy with a birth chart matching Wind's or Cloud's must become a disciple of the Conqueror's Clan. Whispering Wind is discovered as the son of long time rival Whispering Prince, who Conqueror had beaten 2 years previously and stole Prince's wife. As they fight again for Prince's Blizzard Blade he reveals he only took his wife to anger him into battle to possess the blade. At the climax of the duel, Prince's wife kills herself and Prince is captured and killed by the fire beast in the nearby cave. Conqueror finds Whispering Wind has fainted and claims him. Striding Cloud's father, a blacksmith named Striding Sky, is forging the Ultimate Sword and completes the blade just before Conqueror's forces raze his village. As he is killed he reveals that the sword can only be used by a true hero and Cloud is taken by the invading forces.  Ten years pass, and Wind and Cloud are now both fully grown and highly skilled martial artists, raised by Lord Conqueror with his daughter Charity and adopted son Frost. The 3 sons act as Generals in Lord Conqueror's army. Wind and Charity begin to form a relationship, but she is seduced by Cloud and secretly has an affair with him. Conqueror is angered by his inability to open the puzzle box, and the disappearance of Mud Buddha. He sends Frost and Wind to find him while Cloud is sent to claim the Unchallenged Sword and kill the clan leader, leading closer to completing his collection of powerful weapons in his Sword Graveyard. Cloud succeeds and Frost and Wind find Mud Buddha, now disfigured by boils as punishment from the Gods for revealing too much about the future to others. Later, Mud Buddha is taken by a masked fighter who easily repels both Frost and Wind. The captured Mud Buddha unlocks the puzzle for Conqueror and reveals that "the dragon is powerful but will be stranded when wind and cloud become a storm" therefore ending Conqueror's tyranny. Realizing it refers to Wind and Cloud and unwilling to accept his fate Conqueror plots to destroy them both.  Upon realizing Cloud is interested in Charity, Conqueror decides to use her to marry Wind in hopes of Wind and Cloud killing each other. Cloud discovers the marriage and is quickly angered. On the day of the wedding Cloud abducts Charity. Conqueror tells Wind to fight for his wife if he is a man. Wind and Cloud engage in a battle and Lord Conqueror tries to kill Cloud in their duel, but Charity sacrifices herself to save him.  As Wind quietly grieves for his love, Cloud fights the Phoenix family for the Ice Vigor and uses it to preserve Charity's body, but is soon discovered by Conqueror. As they fight in a temple in the desert without water, Cloud's Palm style proves to be useless against Conqueror without any source of liquid at the area. Cloud rips off his arm and uses his own blood as a final resort to be used as source of liquid which is necessary for his palm style to unleash considerable amount of power to create an opening for escape. He is then discovered out cold by Muse and her father, Summit Yu. As they nurse him to health Yu discovers that the Fire Beast Arm he has trained to perfection rejects him and wishes to be bonded to Cloud and calls on specialists to bond his arm to Cloud.  Unable to find Cloud, Conqueror moves onto destroying Wind, who he secretly poisons and sends on a mission to claim the Blood Bodhi fruit. As the poison takes its toll Wind remembers the truth about who killed his parents, and uses the Blood Bodhi fruit that grows in the cave to heal himself as well as make himself even stronger. He then defeats the fire beast who killed his father using the Blizzard Blade retrieved by his father's corpse. Cloud trains his new arm with the help of Muse's kindness before deciding to head back to Conqueror's kingdom.  Conqueror, believing himself free of the prophecy, challenges and defeats Sword Saint after the latter is distracted by Muse. Frost arrives and announces his discovery that it was Conqueror who kidnapped Mud Buddha and framed Wind and Cloud. Conqueror, now deluded into the belief he is invincible, kills Frost, who attempts to leave the clan. Soon afterwards, Wind and Cloud meet upon the steps to Conqueror's main hall and, united by their common enemy, confront Conqueror. As the fight spills over into the Sword Graveyard, Wind and Cloud are almost outmatched by Conqueror's superior sword skills. However, the blood from a cut on Cloud's arm reveals to him the location of Ultimate Sword (which Conqueror unknowingly had amongst the standard weapons littering the ground). With Striding Sky's sword in hand, Cloud rejoins Wind in the battle and Conqueror is soon beaten, with Wind stopping Cloud from landing the death blow so Conqueror is left insane and tormented by the ghosts of those he has killed, including his beloved Charity.  
Still Crazy
 The band Strange Fruit performs at the 1977 [[Wisbech]] Rock Festival. Hughie Case tells how, due to the pursuit of "fame, fortune and fornication" – and the drug overdose of their original singer, Keith Lovell – this is their last performance. After various issues, the band prematurely ends their performance, frustrated over competing egos and various members' lack of self-control.  Twenty years later, a stranger who turns out to be the son of the founder of The Wisbech Rock Festival recognises keyboardist Tony Costello and convinces him to reunite the band for a special anniversary of the event. Tony quickly tracks down Karen Knowles, the band's original runaround-girl. Initially reluctant, she is inspired to return to the band after finding memorabilia. She insists on being the band's manager, and Tony agrees. Gradually, Karen and Tony track down the original members: bassist Les Wickes, who has a family and works as a roofer; drummer David "Beano" Baggot, who is working at a [[Plant nursery|nursery]] and is on the run from the [[Inland Revenue]]; and lead singer Ray Simms, who, after years of drug and alcohol abuse, is now completely sober. Though he claims to be working on a solo album, Simms has not released anything in almost ten years.  The band meets up at the [[Red Lion pub]] to discuss the reunion. Everyone expects Brian Lovell, the band's lead guitarist, to be there. Karen says she was unable to find him but learned he donated away all his royalties to charity; everyone assumes he is dead. Their roadie, Hughie, turns up during their first rehearsal to resume his original role. Ray insists on playing guitar but is convinced to concentrate on  singing. They find a replacement for Brian in young Luke Shand, a talented guitarist who remains blissfully unaware of the band's internal tensions.  Following a warm up tour of Europe, Karen negotiates for the rights to their back catalogue. Their initial performances are poorly received. Les, Beano, and Hughie hold little hope for the band, believing Keith and Brian the main talent. Tony makes advances on Karen, but she resists due to her attachment to Brian. At one of their gigs, Ray's over-the-top ideas backfire, and Les and Ray walk off the stage. Following a confrontation with Les, Ray has a nervous breakdown, exacerbated by turning 50. Ray leaves the gig, buys drugs, and falls into a canal. Karen's daughter rescues him, and Ray's wife blames Karen for his troubles. Following an angry reaction from the townspeople over the volume levels, the band escape to their bus and flee the town.  Les and Ray make up, and Ray says he "received a positive message" from Brian's ghost. The bus breaks down, and Karen confronts the band about their lack of confidence. When the band meet a girl wearing a Strange Fruit tour T-shirt that belonged to her father, they take it as another positive omen. The next few shows go without incident and are well-received; the band becomes slightly more optimistic. Following a record deal, the band records a new song written and sung by Les, which Ray had never previously allowed. However, after watching a previously-taped drunken TV interview in which Les and Beano imply that the band was much better with Keith and Brian, Ray breaks down again and quits.  As the band members return to their former lives, Karen and Claire visit Keith's grave to pay their respects. They find a note that quotes "The Flame Still Burns", a tribute to Keith written by Brian. Hughie is then confronted by Karen, and reluctantly admits he knows Brian is alive. Karen and Tony find Brian in a psychiatric hospital. He explains he gave up his material possessions to sever himself from his previous life. When he agrees to rejoin the band, the others follow. However, at a pre-show press conference, hostile questions cause Brian to walk out. Everyone but Luke follows, and Luke chastises the journalists. Visibly shaken, Brian decides to back out of the show but gives his blessing.  Beano nearly misses the set when a stalker-groupie demands sex. The band starts their set with the same song with which they opened up the last Wisbech Festival. Though Ray's confidence is shaken, Tony saves him by playing "The Flame Still Burns". Brian is pleased to hear the band playing the song, which helps him finally overcome his demons and joins the band onstage to play an inspiring guitar solo, much to the surprise and delight of everyone.  
Stiff Upper Lips
 '''England, 1908''': Emily Ivory (Cates) is a wealthy young woman who lives with her Aunt Agnes (Scales) at Ivory's End, a large country house. At 22, as her aunt constantly reminds her, she is verging on [[Spinster|spinsterhood]]. She meets her brother's best friend, Cedric Trilling (Portal), when the two come home from university. Aunt Agnes wants the two to fall in love:  Cedric, however, is a pompous bore who is overly fond of quoting [[Homer]] on all sorts of not-quite-appropriate occasions; also, he's a [[Homosexuality|repressed homosexual]]. When Emily's aunt sees the sparks failing to fly, she whisks everyone off to Italy, then India, hoping the romantic locations will bring on love.  Emily's eye, however, soon wanders to the family's new [[manservant]], George (Pertwee), a sturdy peasant who, earlier in the film, had the effrontery to fling off all his clothes and save her life when she was drowning in a pond.  Now, Emily can't seem to forget his tall, manly frame and his "ripping set of unmentionables." (George, a sort of [[Wuthering Heights|Heathcliff]]/[[Lady Chatterley's Lover|Gamekeeper]]/Working Class Hero hybrid, has a peculiar way of entering a room; he rushes in, slides to a stop in the middle of the floor with eyes blazing and one shoulder forward, and tosses his cap aside).  With George, Emily achieves carnal fulfillment, true love, and, eventually, motherhood and marriage. Although the upper-class characters disapprove of the alliance, nobody is more scandalised than George's father, who keeps reminding his son that he's "the scum of the earth." When Emily becomes pregnant, she suggests giving the child to George's father; George, appalled, begs her to sell it to pirates, abandon it on a mountain, or let it be raised by wolves instead.  Cedric, too, finds love with Edward (West), Emily's handsome, cheerful twit of a brother.  In that era, it was "[[the love that dare not speak its name]]"; however, during Emily's wedding scene, Edward takes Cedric's arm and shouts "WE LOVE EACH OTHER!" in church.  Even Aunt Agnes meets someone special - an expatriate Englishman (Ustinov) who owns a tea plantation in India. At the end of the film, despite class differences, sexual taboos, and [[ageism|age prejudice]], everyone seems likely to lead happy, sexually fulfilled lives ever after.

Strangeland (film)
 15-year-old Genevieve Gage and her best friend Tiana Moore are typical high school students in Helverton, Colorado who spend their idle time chatting with strangers in [[chat room]]s. After chatting with another apparent student who goes by the screen name of "Captain Howdy," Genevieve and Tiana decide to attend a party at Captain Howdy's house, which is a trap. When neither Genevieve nor Tiana returns home by the next morning, Genevieve's mother, Toni, alerts her husband, local cop Mike Gage (Kevin Gage). With the assistance of a younger cop named Steve Christian (Brett Harrelson), Gage begins searching for Genevieve and Tiana. The case takes an unexpected turn when Tiana's car is pulled out of a lake with Tiana's tortured body inside and no sign of Genevieve.  Mike discovers that Captain Howdy (Dee Snider) is into "body art," including significant [[tattoo]]ing, piercing, branding, and [[scarification]]. But it is not until Mike's niece Angela Stravelli ([[Amy  Smart]]) informs him of Genevieve's penchant for meeting strangers through the Internet that Mike gets his first lead. Meeting the Captain Howdy online, Mike attempts to get Captain Howdy to invite him to a party. Despite the plan going awry, he later figures out Captain Howdy's location and finds his [[torture chamber]]. There, Gage finds Genevieve naked and bound, with her mouth stitched shut, as well as five other teenagers who are in similar predicaments. After a brief struggle in which Captain Howdy gets shot, Mike arrests him and discovers his real name is Carlton Hendricks.  Mike thinks he has closed the case. But a year later, Hendricks is declared [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]] and he is put in the Meistrich Psychiatric Institute, only to be released three years later. Doctors at the Meistrich Institute state that Hendricks, who has been diagnosed as a [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] with a severe [[chemical imbalance]], is okay as long as he is on his medication. So, Hendricks moves back to his old neighborhood. While taking his medicine, Hendricks is timid and apologetic about what he did, but the memories of what Hendricks did are still fresh in the minds of Helverton's residents. Many people are not happy about Hendricks's release, especially an activist group led by Jackson Roth ([[Robert Englund]]) and Catherine "Sunny" Macintosh.  One night, while Roth's teenage daughter, Kelly, is out, a fearful Roth jumps to the conclusion that Hendricks has taken her. Roth calls Catherine and several others and they kidnap Hendricks. During this, Hendricks accidentally drops his medicine bottle, and it is run over by a car. Roth and the group then beat Hendricks and hang him from a tree. As Roth, Catherine, and the others leave, it starts raining and the rope, which turns out to be weak, snaps, saving Hendricks's life. However, the [[near-death experience]], something he had mentioned hoping to attain earlier on in the film, reverts him to being Captain Howdy, this time with revenge on his mind.  After recovering, Hendricks kills Roth's wife Madeline in front of Roth before knocking him unconscious and then kidnapping him. Hendricks also kidnaps Catherine before contacting Mike at the police station. After hanging up with Mike, Hendricks brutally tortures Roth and Catherine. The next day, Toni calls Mike and tells him that Genevieve is missing. When Mike gets home with Steve, Hendricks's face is on Toni's computer screen. Hendricks has Genevieve and her mouth is stitched shut again. Hendricks tortures Genevieve while Mike and Toni watch the screen. After Hendricks disconnects, Genevieve, Roth, Catherine and a few other victims are soon found alive, but brutally tortured, by officers responding to a call. That night, after leaving the torture scene, Mike tracks Hendricks to a church. After a long struggle, Hendricks stands ready to kill Mike with a large meat hook chained to the ceiling. However, Mike sinks the hook into Hendricks's back, slams Hendricks into a wall, and then uses the hook to lift Hendricks off the floor. After Hendricks taunts Mike, Mike pours a [[flammable liquid]] on Hendricks, and presumably kills Hendricks by setting him on fire.

After listening to this Nirmala respects Chandu's character of ''making his lovers marriage with her lover'' and she also volunteers him and they carry out the mission. Meanwhile, Balaramaiah learns of Nandini-Lawrence love. The news spreads quickly like wildfire and both families now think they have run away and want to kill the members of the other family.

At home, Jay's parents at first are reluctant for that since Jay has been disobedient but Sam reminds Mrs. Lee about the time he didn't let her go to the fair to visit a pig she wanted to see.  Mr. and Mrs. Lee then agree to let Jay go to Ridgewell. Sam takes Jay to the library where Jay meets a pretty woman named Rose who he learns from how to pronounce the monkeys' names.

After the ride, Jay notices his father making a horse stall for Annie and tells him he doesn't need to to that and explains that he borrowed Annie for the morning.

When she wakes up, the attending doctor (Kimberly Scott) informs Jane she is HIV positive.  In the same hospital, Tony is being lectured by a therapist about starting a fire in the game room and hiding his medication. The therapist insists Tony take his meds, and it is revealed he has pneumonia. Tony storms off, asking what it matters, he will die anyway. Beginning to experience the symptoms of withdrawal, Jane leaves the hospital, passing by Tony's room. Tony sees her, instantly becomes infatuated, and follows her out into the streets. Jane eventually takes notice and tells Tony to stop following her. He does, apparently. Going to her usual dealer (Derek Webster), he refuses to sell to Jane, despite her pleas and attempts at trading drugs for sexual favors.

At the end of her dance, she is horrified to find Tony watching her from behind one of the booths. She gets her money, leaves in a hurry and scores with a dealer in an alley. High and unaware of reality, Jane wanders the streets, Tony behind her, watching over her.  The next morning, Jane wakes up in a dusty field, Tony sitting beside her. Preparing to leave and hoping Tony will stay away from her, Jane finds vomit on her shirt and knows it will be harder to attract johns that way.  In a local department store, Jane is shifting through a rack and Tony appears. She orders him to leave, so it will not attract attention when she steals the blouse, but before he moves away, she asks him what colour the shirt is, as she is colour blind. Annoyed, she shoves the blouse down the front of her pants but is caught by a floor manager.

Desperate now, Jane decides to rob a convenience store with a toy gun, but the attempt fails. Tony comes out and helps her escape, but not before Jane takes the money from the register. She goes back to her dealer, but after a long moment of just looking at one another, Jane reconsidering and thinking about what Tony said to her, Jane leaves.

After a few days, Jane wakes up on her bed, changed into clean clothes and a clean apartment. Tony has gotten progressively sicker since she passed out.

However, when she tries, Tony begs her not to let him die in there, to let him die with her. When Jane asks him why, he replies that it's because he loves her. They embrace and Jane knows she cannot bring him back to the hospital without hating herself.  Upon finding the police at her door, Jane and Tony flee to a 5-star hotel, where they have a fancy dinner date, dance and talk more about their lives. Jane tells Tony she has never been good with love, giving it or receiving it. Tony reveals to her that he lied about how his mother died. As it turns out, his father is in jail and his mother is dead, most likely by AIDS. He tells her his dad never loved him, but his mother did, just not as much as his father and that he got HIV from his father, hinting that his father sexually abused him. Horrified, Jane asks him if he wants to kill his father for what he has done, but Tony replies that he's probably already dead. Later that night, Tony and Jane make love.  By the morning, Tony's condition has deteriorated rapidly, and he asks her to take him to the lake where she spent her childhood. Jane steals a car from a john and begins driving herself and Tony to the far-off lake. Once there, Jane takes him out of the car, Tony deliriously thinking she is his mother. Jane humors him and brings him into a boat and paddles out. Tony begins to scream in pain, and not wanting him to suffer, Jane pulls out the heroin she bought from a dealer the night she and Tony had their date. She cooks it and injects it into his arm.

Though Zelda's magical abilities are limited, she can create a magical fireball called a seeker to target anyone she commands it to. Threatening his life with this ability, Whizzer goes to Swan Lake Castle as a spy and overhears how Derek and Rogers discovered Rothbart's notes and have it hidden. Odette never knew Derek found the notes and always assumed if such things were discovered, the notes would be immediately destroyed. She tries to convince Derek to dispose of it saying how nothing good will ever come of them while Derek maintained his belief of someday using the notes for good.  After Whizzer informs Zelda, she goes to the castle pretending to be an "accordion slave". She flirts and charms Lord Rogers with a story about how she had escaped a king who kept  her locked up and play the accordion constantly. Rogers falls in love with Zelda and invites her to stay at the castle, despite the reservations of Queen Uberta. That night, Zelda steals the treasure chest with Rothbart's notes and flees. To her dismay, the notes are incomplete and prevent her from gaining the full powers. Zelda questions Whizzer and learns that Derek tore off the remaining portion and has it hidden.  Zelda casts a seeker to find Odette, while Whizzer is sent to deliver a ransome note to Derek. The seeker successfully brings Odette and Jean-Bob to Zelda's lair. At the castle, Derek receives the ransom note and retrieves the tore portion of Rothbart's notes from where he'd hidden it in the library. Whizzer is captured by Speed and Puffin, who convince him to help them stop Zelda. Whizzer eventually agrees and the group heads out to help Derek to rescue Odette.  When Jean-Bob frees Odette, she attempts to sneak off with the notes only to be caught again. Zelda then transforms Odette into a swan, and imprisons her and Jean-Bob in a dome of green fire that would destroy them if they touch it. When Derek arrives at the meeting place to pay the ransom, Zelda tricks Derek into letting his guard down by disguising herself as Odette and snatches the final piece from his grip. Zelda mocks Derek and retracts her promise of returning Odette. Instead, she plans to test the power to destroy on Odette.  Puffin and the others finally meet up with Derek and race toward Zelda's lair. They free Odette and Jean-Bob as Zelda was busy absorbing the power to destroy. Derek and the others face her in battle and as the fight ensues, Zelda conjures a destroying seeker and casts it at Odette. Odette, with Puffin, flies away from the lair in an attempt to escape. Whizzer distracts Zelda by imitating Rothbart's voice, allowing Derek to snap her wand in two. Zelda falls back onto her own dome of green fire spell and is destroyed. Puffin returns to the lair alone and tells Derek that Odette was killed by the seeker. Derek is heartbroken and sobs, regretting that he did not destroy the notes earlier. As he burns the notes, he apologies to Odette and prays some good may still come from it. The flames take on the shape of a swan, from which Odette materializes, and returns to life. Derek embraces her and tells Odette he loves her.  The Kingdom is safe once more and the festival takes place as planned with Jean-Bob winning the obstacle course and becoming prince for a day (with a little outside help from Whizzer), and Uberta and Rogers win the talent show.

Conservative Henry Bell has been eased out of his job by condescending Bruce Tick, while wealthy and wildly eccentric Karen Knightly has been abandoned by her lover Anthony Staxton-Billing, who opted to return to his wife Imogen. Both are intent on committing [[suicide]] by leaping from the [[Tower Bridge]] in [[London]]. When neither succeeds, they strike a bargain whereby each agrees to exact revenge on behalf of the other, although Henry is less enthusiastic about the plan.  Karen, disguised as a frumpy [[Temporary work|office temp]], finds employment as an assistant to Tick and quickly derails his marriage by leading his wife Hilary to believe he's involved in an extramarital affair. Henry, meanwhile, is finding it difficult to keep his end of the bargain, since he has fallen in love with Imogen, the object of Karen's revenge. Instead of planning her demise, he begins an affair with the beguiling woman. Henry learns that Anthony left Karen not for Imogen, but for beautician Daphne Teal, and he begins to suspect Karen is more of a villain than a victim. The woman proves to be a formidable foe when she realizes Henry may renege on their deal.  Adding to the humorous complications are Karen's oddball brother Oliver, who delights in racing through the interior of their rural [[mansion]] on his [[Scooter (motorcycle)|motor scooter]]; elderly and slightly befuddled housekeeper Winnie; and Daphne's very inept daughter Norma, who's being groomed to take over the household chores so Winnie finally can retire.

The film begins with the birth of [[Narendranath Datta]] (pre-monastic name of Swami Vivekananda) and shows the neighbors and relatives of Datta family celebrating the event. It immediately moves to the scene where Narendranath sees his father [[Vishwanath Datta]] is donating money, clothes, food to poor and distressed people.

Different events of child Narndranath are shown one by one, such as his mother is melodiously reciting religious scriptures which leaves an impression on his young mind, Narendranath practicing meditation, his mother is teaching him that experience is true knowledge, and his interest in studying a wide range of subjects.  Young Narendranath attends college where he gets acquainted with European literature and contemporary social and religious movements. He also joins ''[[Brahmo Samaj]]''. But there he finds that the leader who is suggesting others to resist child marriage, is himself organizing his minor daughter's marriage with a wealthy person. Narendranath goes to [[Debendranath Tagore]] and asks him if he has seen God. Tagore confesses that he did not have that experience and also tells Narendranath that he had ''Yogi'''s eyes.  Naredranath meets Ramakrishna in a friend's house where Narendranath sings a devotional song ''Bina Prem Dhiraj Nahi''.

The story of the film quickly moves to 1897, when Vivekananda returns to India.

Taxi (1998 film)
 Daniel Morales ([[Samy Naceri]]) is the fastest delivery man for the local pizza parlour "Pizza Joe" in [[Marseille]], France. On the last day of work, he sets a new speed record, then leaves the job to pursue a new career as a taxi driver with the blessings of his boss and co workers. Daniel's vehicle is a white [[Peugeot 406|1997 Peugeot 406]].   The car is equipped with various racing modifications (such as racing tires, a [[splitter (automotive)|splitter]] and [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]]) that are concealed until he wants to travel quickly. Daniel is just as skilled with a car as he is with a motorcycle, and has a complete disregard for speed limits. His girlfriend Lilly ([[Marion Cotillard]]) is supportive of his job change, although she is unhappy that he now spends less and less time with her.  Daniel's first customer, an elderly woman named Camille, has a son named Émilien ([[Frédéric Diefenthal]]), a young police detective. Émilien is clumsy and has just failed his 8th driver's test. At work, no-one takes him seriously, including police Sergeant Petra ([[Emma Sjöberg]]), on whom he harbors an unrequited crush. Commissioner Gibert ([[Bernard Farcy]]) briefs the team on a new case. A German gang of robbers who successfully committed a series of high profile robberies in [[Belgium]], [[Netherlands]] and (Germany) is now in France.   The gang is known for their highly methodical and effective strategy, skilled driving and their usage of red [[Mercedes-Benz 500E]] cars as escape vehicles. Anticipating the robbers' move, Gibert places police officers and militia in civilian cars outside the targeted bank. After the robbers entered the bank, Émilien, who takes part in the stakeout, accidentally causes a huge traffic accident. Due to the confusion, another convoy of cars (the French Minister's escort) start firing at the officers, and the robbers escape.  The next day, Émilien takes a taxi to work, and gets in Daniel's car. Not knowing his fare's occupation, Daniel reveals his racing modifications and breaks traffic laws several times. Émilien eventually reveals his badge, apprehends Daniel and confiscates his taxi license. At the station, after interrogating Daniel, Émilien asks for help with the German gang in exchange for keeping his license.   Looking at photos of the getaway cars, Daniel concludes that the tires come from a garage owned by Kruger (Gregory Knop). Daniel reluctantly abandons a date with Lilly and joins Émilien at a stakeout of the garage. The next morning, Émilien tries to interrogate Kruger, who opens fire at the duo and escapes.  The police correctly speculate the next target for the robbers and manage to shoot a tracking device onto one of the cars. However, the gang stops at a secluded garage and repaints the cars silver, destroying the tracking device in the process. Although Gibert sets up a cordon around the garage, the police are unable to find any car with the stolen money, and the gang gets away once more. Émilien goes back home to discover that he left the stove on earlier and his house is now burned down.   Émilien and Camille go to Daniel's house, interrupting his long awaited intimate time with Lilly. Émilien discusses with Daniel how the gang manages to escape. Realizing the robbers must have re-painted the car, Daniel contacts one of his friends about the paint and tracks down the robbers to a race track, where they hide the robbed money. The pair go to the track, where Daniel provokes the gang into a race and wins a bet. Upon returning home, they find that Camille and Lilly have become fast friends, and are smoking pot and recounting past stories. The two men also share their past, form a bond of friendship and devise a plan to catch the gang.  The next day, Émilien duplicates the keys of twenty traffic light controllers throughout the city, and provides Daniel with a closed radio line. Daniel gathers his old co workers at Pizza Joe, and Emilien distributes the keys and walkie talkies to them. After the robbers collect the money, Daniel follows them and offers a new bet. Against their better judgement, the drivers agree.   As the delivery men use the traffic lights to clear the path for the cars, they drive onto the freeway. Daniel then speeds towards a bridge which is under construction, and slams on the brake. The robbers' cars jumps over the gap and lands on the other side, only for them to discover that it is an incomplete bridge segment. They are then arrested with the money in the trunks.  Later on, Daniel and Émilien are given medals by the police commissioner, and Émilien begins dating Petra. Daniel competes at the French Grand Prix in a [[Formula 3000]] sponsored by the Marseille Police. The movie ends as the race begins.  
Tale of the Mummy
 In 1948 Egypt, an [[archeological dig]] led by Richard Turkel ([[Christopher Lee]]) reaches a [[tomb]] (of Talos), which is apparently cursed.  The [[hieroglyphics]] at the entrance warn that all should avoid the place as it has been abandoned by all that is [[holy]]. Despite this, they proceed to open the chamber's door only to be blasted with a cloud of dust, which causes them to crumble apart as though they are made of fragile stone. Richard manages to blow the tomb shut, killing himself in the process.  In 1999, Richard's granddaughter Sam Turkel ([[Louise Lombard]]) continues where he left off. When they break into the burial roost, they see Talos's [[sarcophagus]] suspended from the ceiling. One of the team falls to his death, and another (Brad) ([[Sean Pertwee]]) has a seizure while experiencing Talos' past atrocities.  Nine months later, a power cut occurs, during which the container holding Talos's sarcophagus is broken into and a guard is killed. Detective Riley ([[Jason Scott Lee]]) warns them the killer will undoubtedly strike again. At a party, a youth is assaulted by Talos in the bathroom and dragged down the toilet. A man is attacked by Talos in a [[car park]] while Sam explains the core of Talos' myth to Riley. Talos directed that his body parts be removed by his followers; and they believed he would someday be resurrected to reclaim them, gaining physical perfection and immortality. Talos was exiled from [[Greece]] for [[Witchcraft|sorcery]] and came to Egypt where he fell in love and, in a [[pagan]] ceremony, married the [[pharaoh]]'s daughter Nefriama.  Neighboring factions of Egypt ordered the Pharaoh to kill Talos, as all who opposed him were struck with disease or tortured into believing his [[theology]]. To save Nefriama from death, the Pharaoh told her about Talos' upcoming execution and she in turn told Talos. When the Pharaoh's army reached Talos' chamber they saw Nefriama eating Talos' heart. They were all put to death including Nefriama.  Brad, after being arrested and having told this myth to Riley, surmises that the murder victims are [[reincarnation]]s of the pharaoh's followers and that killing Sam (Nefriama's reincarnation) is the only way to stop Talos, who plans to be reborn when the planets align. Brad further explains that part of Talos' curse is that the only one who knows what's going on will be deemed a madman. After Riley steps out of the interrogating cell, Talos appears and kills Detective Bartone and Brad. A reborn Talos tracks down Sam to her apartment, but she manages to get away; however, Talos captures her after posing as a dog.  Riley, now believing whatever Brad told him, contacts Butros and Professor Marcus and together with Claire they use Brad's dead body in a ritual which shows them the possible location that Sam might be held hostage, an unfinished construction site. Sam, meanwhile bound with rags, manages to free herself and stumbles upon a room where a huge nest of rags used to mummify a deceased is clumped in the form of a womb with dead bodies of Talos' victims lying around. As she watches, the water breaks from the womb and a horrifying baby creature is thrown out which quickly grows up into the true form of Talos with only the heart missing.  The four arrive at the construction site with eighteen minutes remaining for the interplanetary event to occur wherein the planets are supposed to align and Talos would regain his physical immortality. Riley and Claire separate from Butros and Professor Marcus. The latter encounter Talos who manipulates Marcus into killing Butros by strangulating her. On the other hand, Claire falls down and gravely injures her leg which then forces Riley to go forward without her. Somewhere else Claire comes to Professor Marcus and after a brief conversation kills him by stabbing him with a scalpel which suggests Talos manipulated Claire into killing Professor Marcus.  Riley finds Sam bound hands and foot and they are intercepted by Talos who is fired upon by Riley but to no avail. Sam begs Riley to kill her which he does by shooting her in order to stop Talos from achieving what he wants. But, it is shown that Nefriama's love resides within Riley and his heart is what Talos wants for which he used Sam to lure him at the right place at the right time. Claire appears and takes out Riley's heart which Talos stuffs within himself just as the planets align and begins to transform.  The police arrive and pull out four dead bodies and a hysteric Claire. Elsewhere in London, Detective Riley is shown to be the reincarnated Talos.

She attempts to locate him, but fails and Kazuya is presumed dead. Kazuya, however, only barely survives and swears revenge, selling his soul to the Devil in exchange for his own survival.  Sixteen years later, Jun works as an Interpol agent and is assigned with a partner, [[Lei Wulong]], to investigate the Mishima Zaibatsu for alleged inhumane experiments on animals by infiltrating the upcoming King of Iron Fist Tournament.

Meanwhile, Jun attempts to reach out to Kazuya, and arrives in time to stop him from murdering [[Michelle Chang (Tekken)|Michelle Chang]], a fellow competitor also seeking revenge against Heihachi for burning her village and causing her parents' deaths. Lee unleashes a pack of genetically-enhanced dinosaurs into the field to kill Kazuya. One devours Anna while Nina escapes. Kazuya taps into his inner power and kills all but one of them before reaching the tower where Heihachi awaits him. After fighting his way past Lee, Kazuya confronts Heihachi and the two fight. In response, Lee activates the island's self-destruction sequence, intending to kill himself and take his family with him.  After taking a vicious beating, Kazuya succumbs to his power and viciously pummels Heihachi. Though it seems as if he will kill his father, Jun manages to reach into Kazuya's heart and enable him to expel the Devil, reverting him to his original self; Heihachi sucker-punches Jun and Kazuya and the three of them fall from the cliff. As the island begins to crumble, Lei, Jack, Jane and Bosconovitch flee the facility; Jack sacrifices himself to hold the door open long enough for his friends to escape. The remaining competitors escape from the burning forest as Kazuya emerges with the unconscious Jun. They escape the island while Heihachi flees in a jet as the island explodes.  Sometime later, Jun is accosted by [[Jin Kazama|Jin]], her young son with Kazuya; Kazuya's whereabouts are left unrevealed. Though Jun senses [[Ogre (Tekken)|something]] is wrong, she dismisses Jin's concern and they walk home together.

Tate's Voyage
 Tate (Teetje) and his friends rob a jewelry store in the middle of the night. The guards catch them red handed, but they manage to escape with the loot, which consists mainly of [[Rolex]]es. It becomes clear that this type of criminality is a habit for Tate, but when he meets his girlfriend Mary, he promises her to 'quit the life'. In order to do so, he buys a Russian ship that is offered to him for €100,000 and was said to have electronics on board, worth at least two million. To be able to buy the ship, he borrows money from his friends with whom he did the robbery, thinking that he can easily pay them back shortly. After the purchase is complete, Tate visits the ship and finds out that there is a 30-man Russian crew on board, and only little food. He also finds out that along with the ship, he also bought a €200,000 debt to [[Yugoslavia]] and hence, the ship has been chained. On top of that, it turns out that the crew hasn't been paid any wages for the past three years, which is the time the Russian crew have been stuck on board the ship in the [[Rotterdam]] harbour.  As Tate is unable to pay his friends back, they threaten to kill him if he doesn't pay within a few days. He hides on board the ship, but the ship is running out of supplies, and more and more crew members are getting sick. When Tate's friends, unable to find Tate, threaten to hurt Mary, he brings her on board. As Mary is a nurse at the Catholic hospital of Rotterdam, she starts to treat the ill crew members. First mate Nikolaj falls in love with Mary and Mary finds out she has feelings for him, too. She later confesses that she gave up her virginity for him.  ===End plot=== As the food runs out, Tate manages to persuade a local supermarket to donate 30 boxes of food. The crew however finds this not enough and threatens Tate to kill Mary if they do not return to Russia soon. Desperate as he is, Tate visits the captain of the ship in the hospital. The captain tells him that he should get rid of the cargo as soon as he can, as the cargo was shipped from [[Chernobyl nuclear power plant]] and thus is radioactive. Tate discovers that Mary and Nikolaj have an affair, returns to the ship, and gives Nikolaj his passport, cellphone and the key to his home. Nikolaj and Mary leave the ship, and Tate, so far unable to speak Russian, orders in Russian to prepare the ship and set sail for Russia. The film ends with the whole crew, including Tate, singing Russian sailor's songs.

The Temptations (miniseries)
  ===Part one (November 1, 1998)=== The story begins in 1958 when [[Otis Williams]], at the time a teenager, is running to meet his friend [[Elbridge "Al" Bryant]] at a musical performance by [[The Cadillacs]], where Otis and the singer lock eyes, which he credits as the moment he devoted his life to music. After the concert, Otis and Al go to a barber where they b get the Tony Curtis and DA-style process. Later, Otis arrives home for dinner, where his stepfather is angered by his hairstyle and pressures him to go to work at the assembly line instead of going into music, which Otis heatedly rejects. Six months later, Otis, Al and two new band members, are singing on a street corner when they see another group of singers across the street, and are impressed by one singer's [[Bass (voice type)|bass voice type]]. The next day after school, Otis spots the singer leaving to walk home, and decides to follow him. The singer sees Otis and begins to run away, thinking him to be a gang member. Otis eventually catches him and introduces himself, finding out that the singer's name is [[Melvin Franklin]], and invites him to join his group, Otis Williams & the Siberians. Melvin agrees, on the condition that his mother approves. After talking to her, Otis convinces Melvin's mother to let him join.  The group, now with five members, are practicing their singing after school one day when they notice a group of girls watching them sing. Upon seeing this, the group follows them while singing "[[Earth Angel]]". The girls go their separate ways until one girl, Josephine, remains, and Otis asks her out on a date. The next Saturday, the group are making out with the girls in a milk truck when they hear for their group to come to the radio station, and hastily drive to the station, which turns out to be a run-down apartment. Johnnie May Matthews, the owner of the pirate radio studio in the basement, declares herself their new manager and producer, and also changes their name to Otis Williams and the Distants. In April 1960, the group are waiting to perform at a party where they meet [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]], [[Eddie Kendricks]], singers for The Primes, [[Diana Ross]], lead singer for the Primettes, [[Smokey Robinson]], lead singer of Smokey Robinson & the Miracles, and [[Berry Gordy]], founder and owner of [[Motown Records]]. Al arrives late at the party and shows hostility towards Eddie and Paul, while hitting on Diana. The Primes and Primettes perform and the Distants are impressed by their sound. After performing themselves, Otis and Melvin see Berry Gordy entering the bathroom and follow him. After some talking, Berry gives them a business card to contact him later on. Once the party8 ends, Johnnie shows up in a new car, bought with the money earned from their record, while also showing off rolls of money. Awestruck, they ask about when they get paid, which angers Johnnie and she immediately fires them, kicks them out of the car and drives away. Al and two other members promptly quit the group, leaving Otis and Melvin as the only two remaining members.  Shortly after, Melvin approaches Otis and tells him that Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams recently left their own group and are interested in joining them. Otis is reluctant to let them join, as he finds them arrogant and cocky, but ultimately accepts when Al rejoins the group. With this new line-up, the group renames themselves the Elgins. Eddie and Paul prove to be valuable members; Paul teaches them how to dance and becomes their unofficial [[choreographer]], while Eddie becomes their [[falsetto]] singer. In March 1961, Otis enters Motown Studios, the headquarters of Motown Records, and meets up with Berry Gordy. After the meeting, Otis finds the others waiting outside for an answer. He informs them that Berry will sign them if they can come up with a better group name. After sitting outside the studio for hours waiting to be called in and thinking up a new name, a secretary named [[Martha Reeves]] finds them outside and calls them in to meet Berry. When they get to Berry, he asks them for their name, to which Otis replies "the Temptations".  Berry likes the name and agrees to hear them sing. After hearing them perform [[Oh Mother of Mine]] (which would become their debut single for Motown) Berry enthusiastically signs them under the Motown label. The group are now in high spirits and make a pact to never leave the group. Otis arrives home to find out that Josephine is pregnant, and although he is shocked, he promises to take responsibility for the baby. In a voiceover, Otis explains that he and Josephine were married shortly after and later gave birth to their son, Lamont. While making moderately successful records written largely by Berry, such as "[[Paradise (Temptations song)|Paradise]]" and "[[I Want a Love I Can See]]", and getting real choreography from Chollie Atkins, the group start to become known as "The Hitless Temptations" as they can't seem to make a real hit in the first three years under the Motown label. The group start to doubt themselves as talented singers and Al starts to lose his passion for singing and becomes more and more negative and volatile. This comes to a head after performing at a New Year's Eve party, Al smashes Paul in the side of the head with a beer bottle when asked to do an encore on stage. He is kicked out the group immediately. The remaining four go back on stage anyway and perform the classic party song "[[Shout (The Isley Brothers song)|Shout]]". While singing, [[Jimmy Ruffin]] and his younger brother [[David Ruffin]] jump on stage and sing as well. The group are impressed the duos' singing, especially David's. After the party, the four, along with David, go to Melvin's mother's house to eat. While they eat and talk, the four invite David to join the group, which he readily accepts. With five members once again, they make a toast to the future success of the Temptations.  In January 1964, the group head to Hitsville to record a song written for them by Smokey Robinson. The song, called "[[The Way You Do the Things You Do]]" becomes an instant hit and puts the Temptations on the map. Shortly after the song hits the charts, the group go on a tour with various other Motown artists, such as [[the Vandellas]], [[the Miracles]], and [[Marvin Gaye]]. One afternoon, while changing a tire on the tour bus, a pair of racist Southerners drive by shooting at them with a shotgun, and David and Eddie try in vain to chase them down, but quickly give up. The tour eventually ends and they all arrive back in Detroit. While Josephine is waiting for Otis in front of Hitsville, she sees him with another woman, and assumes that they are having an affair, and storms off. Soon after, the Temptations go on tour again. In November that year, Smokey writes them another song called "[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]". The song debuts early next year and becomes a massive success, reaching number one on the charts that years. The group enjoys their newfound success and wealth, spending money on themselves and their loved ones.  With this success, however, soon comes trouble. By early 1966, David starts to develop an ego, thinking himself to be solely responsible for the Temptations' success. He also begins using drugs and starts showing up late for rehearsals and meetings, if he shows up at all. This behavior starts to take a toll on the group, and soon after recording "[[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]]", Otis and Melvin pay David a visit, warning him to clean up his act or else be fired. Later, Berry introduces the group to their new manager, Shelly Berger. Shelly plans to expand the Temptations' fanbase to the mainstream white audience, which they are somewhat reluctant about, as they think their original fans will see them as sell-outs. After some consideration, the Temptations agree and are put on a month-long tour with the [[Supremes]]. The tour turns out to be a success and gets them to the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]], although David's destructive behavior continues, and he declares his shady friend, Flynn, his new manager instead of Shelly. Flynn informs the group that David wants to change the group name to "David Ruffin & The Temptations" or else he will not perform, which they reject. David shows up anyway, albeit late, and performs "[[(I Know) I'm Losing You|I'm Losing You]]" at the Copa, and leaves in a separate limo. After the show, the others take a vote on whether or not they should keep David in the group, and all but Eddie vote to kick him out. Shortly after, David shows up at Hitsville in his limo. While the four watch from a window, Shelly meets David outside and hands him a note informing him of their decision. Upon reading this, David flies into a rage, yelling at them through the window. He then gets into his limo and drives off. Melvin rhetorically asks "So now what"?  ===Part two (November 2, 1998)=== Later in 1968, the Temptations hire [[Dennis Edwards]], an old friend, as a replacement for David. It is around this time that the group enters their [[psychedelic soul]] era, started with their 1968 single "[[Cloud Nine (The Temptations song)|Cloud Nine]]". During a concert performance, the group is about to sing "Ain't Too Proud to Beg" when David jumps on stage and steals the microphone from Dennis and sings himself. The others go along with this to [[save face]], but then chase him backstage and get into a brief argument before getting security guards to escort him out. By 1969, Paul's drinking becomes debilitating and Melvin develops [[rheumatoid arthritis]] in the legs and starts taking [[cortisone]] shots to ease the symptoms despite his doctor's advice, yet both continue performing anyway. Around this time Otis and Josephine also get a divorce. As Paul's condition gets progressively worse, the others begin to consider whether Paul should retire, at least for the time being. Eddie is against this, as he thinks that they should stick by Paul and be with him at all times, making sure he doesn't drink. In November 1970, Eddie visits David, who begins to turn him against Otis and Melvin while giving him his first shot of cocaine. Shortly after, Paul becomes well enough to sing again, and the Temptations record a new song written by their producer [[Norman Whitfield]] called "[[Just My Imagination]]". Eddie quits the group after recording the song. Later, Otis and his son Lamont visit Paul at his house. Paul asks to be back in the Temptations, while demonstrating his dancing, almost falling over. Otis tell him that he will be back when he gets better. In June 1972, Norman writes another song called "[[Papa Was a Rolling Stone]]", which the group are initially against recording, but eventually go along with it. In a montage set to the song, Paul is seen struggling with his addiction, while fighting with his wife, and later driving around town, ending with Paul committing [[suicide]] in a parking lot. Eddie reunites with the others at the funeral, with Melvin telling him that while he's out of the group, they will always be family.  By 1977, the Temptations have moved from [[Detroit]] to [[Los Angeles]] and have been hit with a dry spell in their career. The group, now with Otis and Melvin as the only remaining original members, fire Shelly as their manager, leave the Motown label and start recording under the [[Atlantic Records]] label. Eddie is still under the Motown label and has made two major hits, while David, who has had some hits after the Temptations, is also under a dry spell. One day, while Melvin is helping a woman with her grocery bags, a thief gets in his car and tries to start it. When Melvin tries to stop him, the thief shoots him in both of his legs, kicks him out, and drives off in his car. Melvin tells Otis to go on tour without him, as they need the money. After the tour, Otis goes back to Detroit with Lamont to visit his mother, who tells him that she has cancer. They then have a heart-to-heart on the porch.  In 1980, Melvin's legs are still recovering and the Temptations leave Atlantic Records. Eddie's success is starting to fade and he is reduced to playing in small nightclubs. While performing one night, Eddie spots David in the audience and once he finishes the song, brings David on stage and they sing together. After everyone leaves the club, Eddie and David have a drink at the bar and agree to start their own faction of the Temptations, along with Dennis Edwards, who was fired from the Temptations in 1978. Otis and Melvin move back to Detroit and go back under the Motown label and Shelly becomes their manager again. Not long after, Motown becomes interested in setting up a reunion tour between both sets of the Temptations.  By 1982, the tour is officially underway and both sets of Temptations come together to rehearse and become reacquainted. While on tour, Josephine calls and informs Otis that Lamont died in a construction accident. After Otis gets back from the funeral, the tour starts to fall apart, as David's drug addiction starts to trigger his destructive nature.  In 1989, the Temptations are inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. At the ceremony, Otis and Melvin are reunited with David, Eddie, and Dennis. And despite their past squabbles and rivalries, for one moment, they are friends again.  In June 1991, a dead body is found in front of a hospital. After a week in the morgue, the body is finally identified as that of David Ruffin, dead of an apparent drug overdose. Eddie died soon after of lung cancer in October 1992.  In February 1995, Otis and Melvin, now reduced to a wheelchair, visit Melvin's mother. While preparing to eat dinner, Melvin, despite being in a wheelchair, volunteers to get short ribs from the kitchen. While he's gone, Melvin's mother thanks Otis for taking care of Melvin and keeping the Temptations together through all the good and bad times. The two then call for Melvin, but he doesn't respond. They go into the kitchen and find him unresponsive. Many people show up at the funeral, including Smokey Robinson, who sings his song "Really Gonna Miss You".  The film ends with the "classic five" Temptations (Otis, Melvin, Eddie, Paul, and David) in their youth, singing "My Girl" on a stage. At the end of the song, they take a bow, with Otis saying in a voice-over "Temptations, forever."

He offers to arrange a [[Silver Star]] for Staros, to avoid the unit's name being stained by having an officer removed from command. Witt comes across the locals and notices that they have grown distant and distrustful of him and quarrel regularly with one another.  The company is sent on patrol up a river but with the inexperienced 1st Lieutenant George Band at its head. As Japanese artillery fire falls close to their positions; Band orders some men to scout upriver, with Witt volunteering to go along. They encounter an advancing Japanese column and are attacked. To buy time for Corporal Fife to go back and inform the rest of the unit, Witt draws away the Japanese but is then encircled by one of their squads, who demand that he surrender. He raises his rifle and is gunned down. The company is able to retreat safely, and Witt is later buried by Welsh and his squadmates.

Though the three attempt to cover up the crime, they are forced to also shoot a police officer (Bari K. Willerford) when he discovers blood on the ground.  Three days later, Nick shows up on the doorstep of Casey Wells ([[Thomas Jane]]), an old drug dealing partner who has cleaned up his life. He is now a married architect and is looking to adopt a child with his wife. Nick leaves a couple of suitcases in Casey's guest room before leaving to run some errands. After Nick leaves, Casey becomes suspicious of one of the suitcases and eventually opens it to find it filled with [[heroin]]. After calling Nick to yell at him for bringing drugs into his home, he disposes of all of it in the kitchen sink.  Ice ([[Glenn Plummer]]), a Jamaican Rasta hitman, enters Casey's house and is about to kill him, but Casey manages to persuade him to have a last smoke of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. After having smoked, Ice is about to kill Casey when Ice's cell phone rings. Ice begins to rap over the phone in an effort to clinch a record deal, and Casey seizes the moment and knocks him out. Casey then ties him up and leaves him in his garage. Dr. Jarvis ([[Michael Jeter]]), a representative from the adoption agency comes to interview Casey about his fitness to be a father. Dr. Jarvis is particularly curious to know what Casey did for several years when he lived in L.A. as there is no account of his time there. Casey tries his best to cover up his past as well as his recent encounter with the hitman.  During the interview, Dallas, who wants the money that she believes Nick left with Casey along with the heroin, shows up. She scares away Dr. Jarvis from the adoption agency by telling a story about Casey's drug-dealing and murdering past. When left alone with Casey, Dallas questions him about the money's whereabouts. Angry that he cannot help her, she decides to kill him. But not before she ties him up to a chair, [[fellatio|fellates]] him to force an erection, strips naked and proceeds to mount and [[Non statutory female on male rape|rape him]]. She tells him she will not kill him until he orgasms and she plans to go on until she makes him get an orgasm. Delivering on her word, she reaches multiple orgasms, but gets no results from him. While Dallas reaches a third orgasm, Billy breaks in and shoots her, splattering her blood all over Casey, his walls and his floor.  Billy believes Casey when told that he does not have the heroin, but plans on torturing him with a saw and a [[blow torch]] anyhow, while he brags about his prowess and technique of [[cauterization]] as he sets to work. Billy is interrupted by cops raiding the house next door. As Billy checks on it Casey is able to loosen the tape around his wrists and grabs a frying pan and sits back down. Billy returns and tells Casey the cops got the wrong house. As he is about to proceed, he notices something is wrong. But catching Billy off guard, Casey overpowers him, and leaves him in the garage.  Nick calls Casey from a pay phone, apologizes for everything and admits he had stolen the heroin and money from the police. After he hangs up, it is revealed to us that Nick has been shot, and is bleeding severely, seemingly about to die. Finally, corrupt cop Kasarov ([[Mickey Rourke]]) arrives with a bag which contains Nick's head. He gives Casey until 7 p.m. to find the money but tells him that he does not care about the heroin. Kasarov then sees the garage with Ice and Billy tied up and Dallas dead and unloads a magazine into Ice and Billy. He then tells Casey to throw them out as it is garbage day.  In the end, Casey calls Ice's boss and tells him that the heroin is being auctioned off at 7 p.m. at his house, setting up a gun battle between the Jamaicans and the corrupt officers. He recalls Nick's earlier words which promptly lead him to find the money and a wedding present in the spare tire of his car. He takes them, puts them in Dallas's [[Lamborghini Diablo]] car and goes to pick his wife up at the airport to presumably escape the country.

Torrente, el brazo tonto de la ley
 José Luis Torrente is a lazy, rude, drunkard, [[sexist]], racist, [[far right|right-wing]] ex-[[Police officer|policeman]] turned [[Police impersonation|fake cop]] who lives in a decrepit apartment in a slum neighbourhood of [[Madrid]] with his wheelchair-bound father, whose disability checks are Torrente's only real income.  One day, a new family of neighbours which owns and operates a fish store moves into the apartment below Torrente's and he becomes attracted to the young, [[Hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]] niece of the family, Amparo. In order to get close to her, he befriends her nerdy weapon enthusiast cousin, Rafi, by taking him to target practice and on his nightly patrol rounds through the neighbourhood. During their patrols, Torrente begins to suspect that criminal activity is occurring in the new local Chinese restaurant. His suspicions are confirmed when his father accidentally overdoses after eating a stolen food roll which was filled with packets of heroin. Torrente decides to crack the drug ring in order to regain his former status within the Police Force.  Simultaneously, Torrente successfully attempts to seduce Amparo, who has sex with him after his father's overdose. Amparo's aunt, Reme, misreads her relationship with Torrente and believes that they are engaged.  Torrente and Rafi sneak into the restaurant at night and witness El Francés, the underboss of the drug trafficking outfit run by a mobster named Mendoza, torturing and executing a delivery boy named Wang, who had lost a shipment of the heroin (which in reality was unwittingly taken by Torrente's father) and they overhear that the outfit will soon be receiving a major drug shipment from a mobster known as Farelli. The pair accidentally make their presence known and flee the restaurant on Rafi's fish delivery van while being chased by armed delivery boys.  Torrente enlists the help of Rafi's equally nerdy friends: Malaguita, a martial artist, Bombilla, an electronics expert, and Toneti, a [[James Bond]] aficionado. The crew picks up Torrente's father from the hospital (while drunk) and then prepare a reconnaissance mission to discover the location of the drug deal. Toneti goes to the Chinese restaurant while wearing a wire but quickly blows his cover and winds up revealing Torrente's name to El Francés before trying to escape through a window and falling to his death.  El Francés and some of his goons raid Torrente's apartment but are attacked by Torrente's father, who wields a taser and some pliers, before the father suffers a heart attack and plummets down a flight of stairs. Nonetheless, they kidnap Amparo when she arrived to the apartment looking for Torrente.  After discovering his father's death and Amparo's kidnapping, Torrente becomes despondent but soon after Lio-Chii, Wang's girlfriend and a waitress at the Chinese restaurant who had once waited on a drunken Torrente, arrives and reveals the location of the drug deal, claiming she wants revenge for her boyfriend's death.  Torrente, Rafi, Malaguita, Bombilla, Lio-Chii and Torrente's friend and informant Carlitos head over to the drug deal on an old warehouse outside town. The crew plan a very complex plot to bring down the deal and take the 50 million pesetas that Mendoza brought but the plan goes raw from the start when Bombita accidentally blows himself and Farelli up with a bomb he'd set up as a distraction. Farelli's men and Mendoza's men begin shooting at each other and in the aftermath, most of the mobsters and Carlitos end up dead. Torrente guns down El Francés and ends up getting shot in the stomach himself, while Rafi goes to rescue Amparo (who had been providing [[oral sex|oral service]] to Mendoza's men in a back room). Rafi gets cornered by Mendoza but he's rescued when Lio-Chii shoots him in the back.  In the aftermath of the shootout, Rafi and Malaguita get congratulated by police commissioner Cayetano for helping in bringing down one of the most vicious local drug rings and Rafi begins a relationship with Lio-Chii. Torrente gets taken away on an ambulance for his wounds. Cayetano sweeps the scene and discovers that the money is gone. In the ambulance speeding away, Torrente bribes the ambulance drivers (played by the comedy duo [[Faemino y Cansado]]) and flees to [[Torremolinos]] with the 50 million pesetas that he swiped while no one was watching.  
Tokyo Eyes
 In ''Tokyo Eyes'', K (Shinji Takeda, 26), a young Japanese [[debugger]] and free-lance [[programmer]] (also [[Techno]] [[Gramophone record|LPs]] collector in his free time), is a vigilante who non-fatally shoots wrong-doers as he encounters them in his daily life.  Before each shooting, he puts on a pair of thick glasses. The local media quickly names the mysterious attacker "Four-eyes" (''Le Bigleux'' in the original version, lit. "the poor-sighted") based on the police composite.  Hinano (Hinano Yoshikawa, born [[Ai Takeda]], 19) is a seventeen-year-old girl who works part-time (''[[arubaito]]'') as  a hairdresser. She lives with her older brother Roy, a police officer (Tetta Sugimoto, 33) assigned to the "Four-Eyes" case. While in the subway, she notices a young man secretly filming other passengers, and, intrigued, begins to follow him. Later, she asks her friend and co-worker Naomi (Kaori Mizushima, 34) to join her investigation into the strange young man.  She finally approaches K, and they quickly become friends. He invites her to his apartment and shares his interests of [[Trance music|trance]] and [[video games]] with her. Hinano is suspicious, but she relents, and finds herself in the middle of a romance with the unconventional young man.  In the meantime, Four Eyes is still at large, and Roy's investigation is not closer to finding the shooter. Hinano witnesses one of K's shootings, and is conflicted about what she should do with this knowledge. Hinano confronts K, and K explains that he modified his pistol to be inaccurate, presumably so that the bullets don't actually hit its target. However, later on K accidentally kills one of his victims - a man who was breaking up with a girl for a different girl.  In a second confrontation, K reveals that he uses the thick glasses to cause his victims to hold still, and so that he himself cannot see his victims clearly. He admits that he would not be able to shoot his victims if he looked them in the eye. In addition, he takes video because of a desire to see what is going on in the world, not just look. Despite having lots of video footage of people, he says it is hard to see. But K explains to Hinano that he is willing to give it all up, and refers to Four-Eyes as someone he can separate from, which puts Hinano at ease.  K is visited by a low-ranking [[yakuza]] member (Beat Takeshi) who comes to pick up K's handgun which was apparently on loan, but it is accidentally fired into K's lower abdomen. K does not go to the hospital, but instead meets Hinano and walks around with her. K asks Hinano to meet him at the top of the tallest building in Tokyo. Hinano waits at the top of an observation deck, but K, succumbing to his wound, sways dangerously by the curb of a busy street. In the last sequence, Hinano is walking down the street. Her hand is grabbed; she looks up and sees K's smiling face.  The ending is ambiguous, since it is not clear whether K died. It should be pointed that the international version, including the Japanese one, features seven minutes of additional footage, and possibly a more explicit ending compared to the original cut.

The detective assigned to the case learns that three years prior another Tomie Kawakami was murdered in rural Gifu prefecture. Other slain Tomie Kawakami's are discovered stretching all the way back to the 1860s, right when Japan began to modernize. The detective tracks down one of Tomie's classmates called Tsukiko ([[Mami Nakamura]]), an art student who is being treated for amnesia. She has absolutely no memory of the three-month period around Tomie's death, and is starting to suspect the cause has a supernatural source. Meanwhile, Tsukiko's neighbor is rearing a peculiar baby-like creature. Over the span of a couple weeks, it grows into a beautiful teenaged girl with orange eyes responding to the name of Tomie Kawakami.  Soon afterwards, Tomie begins seducing Tsukiko's boyfriend Yuuichi (Kouta Kusano). Meanwhile, Tsukiko enters her new neighbor's apartment to investigate. Upon discovering her friend's dead body, she is attacked by her landlord and passes out due to asphyxiation. She wakes up in her psychiatrist's office and encounters Tomie. Tomie starts emotionally taunting Tsukiko and tries feeding her live cockroaches. She then begins taking selfies next to her. Soon thereafter, Tsukiko's boyfriend murders Tomie. As they go bury Tomie's headless body in the woods, she comes back to life and Tsukiko runs off further into the woods and finds herself on a boat dock. Tomie then appears once again, now fully regenerated, and kisses Tsukiko on the lips. They both begin laughing as Tsukiko lights a flare and sets Tomie on fire.  Tsukiko is now shown leading a normal life, still taking photographs and being interested in art. One day as she goes to develop a picture she took of herself, she notices a mole under her left eye she didn't have before; the same kind of mole Tomie had. Tsukiko then looks at herself in the mirror in shock as Tomie appears, smiling.  
Tomorrow Night (film)
 Charles is the misanthropic obsessive-compulsive owner of a photo shop. He lives alone, and at night sexually gratifies himself by sitting in a bowl of ice cream. One day, Charles notices an abundance of photos he has developed that have not been picked up. He begins to call each customer to remind them to pick up their photos. One of these customers is Florence, an elderly woman who is tormented by her gambling-addicted husband Lester. She longs for her son Willie, who joined the army two decades ago but has not returned any of her letters; although in fact, the dim-witted Willie does not realize that he is on the end of a cruel joke played by the Army mail-room workers who have not given him any of his mother's letters over the past twenty years or sent his.  Charles decides to seek companionship; he attempts to date an aggressively sexual prostitute named Lola Vagina but finds her too extroverted. When he realizes that the final two packages of photographs in his store belong to Florence and another mysterious customer who will not pick up their phone, he visits Florence himself to deliver her photographs. After meeting her, Charles is attracted to her extreme cleanliness, and visits her the next day to ask to marry her. Florence, however, explains that her husband will never allow a divorce, but Charles asks to speak with him. That night, Lester finally wins at the dog races, but is attacked and killed by a pack of wild dogs while walking home with his winnings.  Charles and Florence wed. After returning from their honeymoon in Florida, Florence discovers him sitting in ice cream. She is disgusted, but allows him to continue if he agrees to adopt a son with her.

That night, Florence says that she is happier than she has ever been; the next morning, Charles asks for a divorce, but finds that Florence has died. He leaves, and Willie becomes Clean's new father.  He returns to his photo shop, where he finds the last package of photos left by a customer who did not leave his name or address. Charles attempts to call him again, but finds the number is not listed. Finally, he opens the envelope, and finds a series of photographs of random places and people. He comes to a photo of himself inspecting those photos, while the next photo is of his dead body shortly after. The film closes on Charles' terrified eyes, while Lester's laughing and dog growls are heard.  
Train of Life
 The film starts off with a man, named Schlomo ([[Lionel Abelanski]]), running crazily through a forest, with his voice playing in the background, saying that he has seen the horror of the [[Nazis]] in a nearby town, and he must tell the others. Once he gets into town, he informs the [[rabbi]], and together they run through the town and once they have got enough people together, they hold a town meeting. At first, many of the men do not believe the horrors they are being told, and many criticize Schlomo, for he is the town lunatic, and who could possibly believe him? But the rabbi believes him, and then they try to tackle the problem of the coming terrors. Amidst the pondering and the arguing, Schlomo suggests that they build a train, so they can escape by deporting themselves. Some of their members pretend to be Nazis in order to ostensibly transport them to a [[concentration camp]], when in reality, they are going to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] via Russia. Thus the Train of Life is born.  On their escape route through rural Eastern Europe, the train sees tensions between its inhabitants, close encounters with real Nazis as well as Communist partisans, and fraternization with [[Romani people|gypsies]], until the community arrives just at the frontlines between German and Soviet fire.  Its ends with the voice-over of Schlomo himself, who tells the stories of his companions after the arrival of the train in the Soviet Union: Some went on to Palestine, some stayed in the Soviet Union, and some even made it to America. As he is telling this, a cut to a close-up of his face happens as he says, "That is the true story of my shtetl...", but then the camera makes a quick zoom-out, revealing him grinning and wearing prisoner's clothes behind the barbed wire of a [[concentration camp]], and he ends with, "Ye nu, ''almost'' the true story!" Thus, it is implicated that he became mad because of having seen most of his companions exterminated, having made up the whole story for himself in his lunacy.

Trans (film)
 The film opens in the Southwest Florida [[youth detention center]], where we are introduced to the protagonist, Ryan Kazinski (Ryan Daugherty) in his cell, obviously having a difficult time with his confinement. We are also shown the harsh conditions and level of discipline in the facility through prisoner's interactions with guards and Ryan's own experience with the warden.  Later while on trash pickup detail, a fight breaks out between two inmates, and several other inmates (including Kazinski) escape in the confusion. Kazinski and two other inmates are seen running through an orange grove and a swamp, eventually coming to a farmhouse where they enter the house and steal civilian clothes.  The inmates leave the farmhouse and travel down a dirt road to a rural convenience store where Ryan steals an ice cream bar. While he is eating in the restroom, the other two escapees steal a truck and drive away, leaving Ryan behind.  Ryan emerges to find them gone and is questioned by some of the locals who take a liking to him and ask him about his plans and whether he intends to keep running. One of the locals gives Ryan a ride into town.  In the city, Ryan spends time listening to a street musician and talking with a parking meter.  Ryan then ends up in a supermarket where he inhales [[nitrous oxide]] from whipped cream cans and observes and interacts with customers. Upon leaving the supermarket, Ryan steps on the bottle cap of one of two men who are drinking beer on the hood of a car. The men become offended and one proceeds to beat Ryan unconscious.  While unconscious Ryan has a vision of a silhouetted woman against a blue sky.  Ryan is recognized and awakened by three other ex-inmates, with whom he attends a party. He leaves, assuring his friends that he has a place to stay.  Ryan visits his brother, who questions him as to why he ran when he only had one month left of his sentence to serve. Ryan cannot answer, and informs his brother of his plan to go to Colorado and seek his mother. Ryan's brother then reluctantly tells him to leave before he becomes too attached to him again.  Ryan enters a bus station and asks for a one-way ticket to Denver. He discovers that he doesn't have the money for the ticket, and after attempting to bribe the bus station manager he is thrown out of the bus station.  Ryan then hitches a ride with a lady who takes him to a doughnut shop. While she is inside, he discovers a gun in her purse, steals it, and runs away.  Ryan is later approached by one of the other escapees who enlists his help in breaking into a veterinary clinic to steal drugs. The two break in, but while the other inmate steals the drugs, Ryan is distracted by the dogs in the kennels, one of which he frees and later places in the window of his brother's room.  Soon after, Ryan is spotted by police. He pulls out his gun, which the police notice, and then runs. The police fire two shots, but it is never made clear if Ryan is hit.  The following morning, Ryan is seen observing planes taking off and landing at a small airport. He approaches a man sitting at a table and asks if he could take him up. The man notices the gun in Ryan's hand, and we then see the plane taking off. The film ends with Ryan looking out of the window smiling.

The Truman Show
 Truman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of ''The Truman Show'', a [[reality television]] program which is broadcast live around the clock and across the globe. His entire life has taken place within a giant [[Arcology|arcological]] dome in [[Hollywood]], fashioned to create the seaside town of Seahaven Island, and equipped with thousands of cameras to monitor all aspects of his life. The producers discouraged Truman from wanting to leave Seahaven by instilling him with [[aquaphobia]] through the "death" of his TV father in a boating "accident", and by constantly broadcasting and printing messages of the dangers of traveling. All of Seahaven's residents are actors, either acting out a script or repeating lines fed to them by the show's creator and executive producer, Christof. Christof seeks to capture Truman's real emotion and human behavior and give audiences a relatable everyman.  Despite Christof's control, Truman manages to act in unexpected ways. During his college years, Truman was intended to fall in love with and marry co-student Meryl, but he fell in love with another actress, Sylvia. Sylvia managed to bring Truman out of the sight of cameras long enough to warn him that his reality is fake before she was taken away, with her "father" claiming they are traveling to [[Fiji]]. While Truman went on to marry Meryl, he continues to fantasize about Sylvia, using scraps from magazines to recreate her face in secret, and seeks travel to Fiji. Outside of the show, Sylvia has become part of a "Free Truman" campaign that demands the end of the show.  The film begins during the thirtieth year of the show. Truman starts noticing unusual events that seem centered on him: a falling spotlight, rain that only falls on him, and a radio channel that precisely describes his movements. Truman spots a disheveled man and recognizes him as his father, who had snuck back into the set, but other actors quickly drag the man away. Despite efforts by Meryl and Truman's best friend Marlon to reassure him, Truman becomes even more suspicious about his life. One day, he takes Meryl by surprise by going on an impromptu road trip, but their way is blocked by increasingly implausible emergencies. Meryl begins to break down from the stress; during an argument with Truman, she [[breaking character|breaks character]] and is taken off the show. Hoping to bring Truman back to a controllable state, Christof re-introduces Truman's father to the show properly, under the guise of having [[amnesia|lost his memory]] after the boating accident. This helps the show regain the ratings lead with audiences.  Truman seems to return to his routines, except that after Meryl moves out he begins sleeping in his basement. One evening the production staff discovers that the sleeping Truman is completely out of their sight. Marlon is sent to check on Truman, finding that he has left a dummy and a tape recorder in his place and disappeared through a makeshift tunnel. Marlon breaks character, and Christof orders the first transmission cut in the show's history while a citywide search for Truman is launched. Audiences around the world are drawn to this sudden change. Truman is found sailing out of Seahaven, having conquered his fear of water, and Christof resumes the broadcast as he sends a man-made lightning storm to try to capsize the boat. Network executives fear that Truman may die on live television, but Truman manages to persist. Realizing he cannot dissuade Truman any further, Christof ends the storm.  Truman continues to sail until – to his surprise – his boat punctures the wall of the dome. He finds an exit door, but Christof, speaking directly to Truman through a speaker system, tries to convince him to stay, stating there is "no more truth" in the real world and that by staying in his artificial world, he would have nothing to fear. Truman considers this, then states: "In case I don't see you... good afternoon, good evening, and good night," previously his unwitting catch-phrase, takes a bow, and leaves. Sylvia races to meet Truman, while Christof's supervisors end the show for the last time and the viewers of his show start looking for something else to watch.  
Twilight (1998 film)
 Aging private detective Harry Ross (Newman), an ex-cop, is working on a case to return 17-year-old runaway Mel Ames (Witherspoon) to her parents' home. He tracks down Mel and her sleazy boyfriend, Jeff Willis (Schreiber), at a Mexican resort. During a struggle, Mel accidentally shoots Harry with his pistol, striking him in the upper thigh.  The plot picks up two years later, when Ross is living in [[Southern California]] in the guest quarters of Mel's wealthy parents, Jack (Hackman) and Catherine Ames (Sarandon). They are former movie stars, now in the twilight of their careers. Jack is dying of cancer, which is out of remission, and he and Ross pass time playing cards.  One day, Jack asks a favor of Harry: to deliver a package to an address in Los Angeles. It turns out to be the first development in a series of twists and turns in a 20-year-old case involving the disappearance of Catherine's ex-husband.  When Harry arrives at the address, he encounters a man named Ivar, who has just been fatally shot and shoots at Harry. Harry is detained by police, including former colleague Lt. Verna Hollander (Channing). At the police station, he runs into another (now retired) old pal and colleague, Raymond Hope (Garner).  Verna and Raymond are both sympathetic, as they had heard rumors that Harry suffered damage to his genitals when shot in Mexico. Harry explains that he was only shot in the thigh.  Harry likes Catherine, who flirts with him from time to time. He acts as an agent for Jack and Catherine, who are being blackmailed by Jeff, now out of prison, and his parole officer Gloria Lamar (Martindale).  Harry and Catherine have sex for the first (and only) time. Jack angrily realizes this when he has a heart attack that same night, and Catherine responds to his call for help wearing Harry's shirt.  Harry, meanwhile, is forced to acknowledge that his friends have deceived and manipulated him.   Raymond tries to persuade Harry to get away from it all, but Harry has figured out that Raymond was a conspirator in the murder of Catherine's first husband 20 years before. Raymond shoots at Harry, but Harry kills him first. Following this shooting, Harry reconciles with Catherine and Jack. He leaves town with Verna.  
U.S. Marshals (film)
 In New York, security cameras in a [[United Nations]] parking garage record two [[Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS) agents attempting to intercept a briefcase exchange between two men. One man kills the agents; the other escapes with top secret information.  In Chicago, months later, police arrest tow truck driver Mark Warren for possession of an illegal handgun and discover that he is federal fugitive Mark Roberts, wanted for a double homicide. Roberts boards a prisoner transport aircraft back to New York, sharing the flight with Deputy [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Samuel Gerard, who is escorting another prisoner to the transport's first stop in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. A Chinese prisoner armed with a [[improvised firearm|zip gun]] tries to kill Roberts mid-flight but in the struggle, the bullet pierces a window, depressurizing the cabin and sending the prisoner to his death, along with another Marshal. The plane makes an emergency crash landing in Southern Illinois, where Roberts flees and Gerard issues a manhunt for the escapee. DSS Director Bertram Lamb reveals that Roberts' fingerprints ID him as the killer of his DSS agents and assigns DSS Special Agent John Royce to join Gerard's team to hunt Roberts. Gerard inspects Royce's firearm and dismissively insists Royce replace it with a Glock.  After traveling to New York City and securing money, weapons and fake identification, Roberts surveilles Chinese diplomat Xiang Chen, the other man from the parking garage. In Chicago, Gerard and the Marshals pursue several leads, including Roberts' girlfriend Marie Bineaux. Roberts secretly contacts Bineaux to explain that he secretly worked for the government and was ambushed during a routine exchange, killing the men before realizing they were DSS agents. The Marshals track the airplane mechanic who was bribed to hide the zip gun and discover too late that he has been murdered by Chen.  Gerard acquires the surveillance footage of the murders and discover Roberts killed the agents in self-defense and was wearing gloves; thus he could not have been identified by fingerprints at the scene as Lamb claimed. Confronted with the evidence, Lamb admits that Mark Roberts is in fact Mark Sheridan, a former [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] Marine, who was working as an [[Non-official cover|unofficial operative]] for the government. The DSS is investigating a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] within the U.S. State Department selling covert secrets to China, believed to be Sheridan. The agents were tailing Chen, a Chinese intelligence agent who was the contact between China and the mole, but when they tried to intercept the exchange, Sheridan killed them and fled.  Eventually, Gerard and his team catch up with Sheridan in Queens Hill Cemetery where he ambushes DSS Special Agent Frank Barrows, who conspired with the mole to frame Sheridan by duping him into making the exchange. As Sheridan holds Barrows hostage to try and clear his name, Chen inadvertently kills Barrows while trying to shoot Sheridan. Marshals Savannah Cooper and Bob Biggs apprehend Chen, while Sheridan flees to a retirement home followed by Gerard, Royce and Marshal Noah Newman. During a struggle, Royce disarms Sheridan and holds him at gunpoint. Before Royce can kill Sheridan, Newman walks into the room and Royce shoots Newman, giving Sheridan the opportunity to jump off the roof and onto a moving subway. Royce gives false information to Gerard, claiming that Sheridan shot Newman, who later dies of his injuries before he can reveal the truth.  Gerard, out for revenge, abandons his team and takes Royce along while following up on a new lead. They track Sheridan to a loading dock in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]] where he is stowing away on a freighter bound for Canada. Gerard confronts, fights and nearly kills Sheridan but lets his guard down, enabling Sheridan to get the upper hand. Royce unloads his Glock at Sheridan, hitting him in the shoulder, and the marshals take Sheridan into custody.  At the hospital, Gerard recognizes the gun that killed Newman as Royce's old firearm. He leaves Royce alone and Royce goes in the hospital room, revealing himself to Sheridan as the mole who set him up just when Gerard walks in and questions Royce about killing Newman. Royce admits to being the mole, and to killing Newman since he witnessed Royce trying to kill Sheridan, then tells Gerard that he's doing the same thing, when Royce attempts to pull out his backup firearm, Gerard shoots and kills him first.  Sheridan is publicly exonerated at a government hearing and makes peace with Gerard, who then gives his team a backhanded apology before they depart to honor Newman's memory.  
Tycus
 In 1989, astronomer Dr. Peter Crawford discovers a comet on a collision with Earth. He reports his findings to the council, but they refuse to listen to him. Ten years later the comet, now called Tycus, is rapidly closing on the Earth. But Tycus is not on a collision course with the Earth; Tycus is going to impact the moon. If Tycus does impact the moon, it will be shattered and the fragments will be pulled in by Earth's gravity.  Dr. Crawford begins the construction of a vast city located under the Sierra Mountains. His city would provide a safe haven for a few people who would become the beginning of the new age after the catastrophe. A young reporter, Jake Lowe, is investigating the building site when he finds out that only a few people get to inhabit the city. So he requests to Dr. Crawford that he and his pregnant wife be allowed entrance into the city because he discovered the city’s existence. Dr. Crawford agrees as he also wants his wife and daughter in the city. At the same time, a nuclear missile fails to do anything to stop Tycus.  They plan to fly Crawford's jet to Los Angeles, now in a state of chaos as news of the comet is made public. Jake finds his wife and gets her to the rendezvous point. Unfortunately, someone has already taken the jet so Jake, his wife, and Crawford's family use a pick-up truck to reach the city. Tycus then smashes into the moon, shattering it.  As the fragments approach, Crawford's group sees a group of people desperately waiting for the doors to the city to open. Crawford activates the elevator and walks towards the door. After they all entered the elevator, Crawford is grabbed by the group of people and he is forced to stay behind. The elevator descends into the underground city.  The debris starts to rain down to Earth. The fragments obliterate every major city in the world, cause massive disasters like tsunamis, and much of the human race is wiped out.  In the year 2029, after the Earth has recovered from the disaster, a young woman, implied to be Jake's daughter, tells a group of people sitting in the Sierra Mountains of an ancient world where highways and buildings covered the Earth's surface; she tells of Dr. Crawford, who first discovered the little dot in the sky and how that little dot would lead to the downfall of mankind. As the story continues, She tells of how thousands of moons reminds the survivors of the New Age and we are shown that the pieces left of the moon have formed an asteroid belt around the Earth…  The film relied heavily on [[stock footage]], recycling shots from ''[[Dante's Peak]]'', ''[[Asteroid (film)|Asteroid]]'', and ''[[Air America (film)|Air America]]'' amongst several films.  
The Truth (1998 film)
 The film begins with some insight into the Brahmin family of Patteri ([[Thilakan]]), a respected astrologer. He helps a police officer named Pothuval ([[Janardhanan (actor)|Janardhanan]]) to crack an ill-famed temple robbery. The story then moves to a political arena, where the well-liked and righteous Chief Minister, Madhavan ([[Balachandra Menon]]) initiates a crackdown on corrupt Government servants, angering his party and Ministers alike. In the by-election soon to follow, where he has to win to retain his position as the Chief Minister (CM), the party conspires against him for that matter. During a chance encounter with the CM, Patteri senses a bad omen regarding Madhavan’s success and hopes maybe the by-elections won't happen. Meanwhile, an enigmatic and alluring woman is shown entering a flat where she meets an accomplice and they go through the details of an assassination which they plan to carry out soon. The plan is executed and the Chief Minister is killed along with a few other officers, by an explosion while on dais of a public election meeting.  The initial investigation is headed by the IPS officer Meena Nambiar ([[Vani Vishwanath]]). Aided by a misplaced camera from the debris, suspicion is laid on the photograph of a ‘killer woman’, who sneaked into the venue using a forged journalist pass. They trace the local temporary residence of hers and arrest the home owner ([[Babu Namboothiri]]) and his family on charges of sheltering the culprit, although he was tricked by the woman. The investigation advance no further and this provokes the Judge dealing the case; because for no solid reason, the home owner and his family are being punished, due to the inefficiency of the investigating officer. The sensational nature of the case, achieved partly because of Meena Nambiar’s media obsession, causes a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to take over.  The SIT arrives from Delhi and is headed by Bharath an IRS officer posted in Ministry of Home Affairs([[Mammootty]]), who is Patteri's son. The initial friction between Bharath and Meena, dwindles to a friendship, once Bharath makes the first startling discovery. Bharath is targeted more than once by unknown assassinators, on one occasion even inside the police HQ. While this frightens most, he gets convinced that the enemy is “near” and influential. In spite of so many complicated deceptive leads, he grows suspicious of the credibility of the photograph of the killer woman. The fact that the residence of the killer yielded no female fingerprints and there is an unidentified male fingerprint in the same apartment reveals to him that the photograph was a decoy. The killer is a male and the police kept chasing someone who isn’t there. They learn the whereabouts of him, by strategic publicizing of a generated photograph of the man. They also apprehend the killer’s accomplice. But, close to capturing the killer, who goes by the name Bose, they find him killed by the enemy.  The investigation now almost comes to a standstill, until they learn that there was a similar attempt before, which did not materialize. The killer expected someone else with the CM, who was the Deputy Superintendent of Police (Dy.SP), John. They quickly learn that Dy.SP John ([[Saikumar (Malayalam actor)|Saikumar]]) was the actual target and the death of the CM was an added advantage. The illusion of a political conspiracy against the CM was the enemy’s trump card. In search of a motive behind the assassination, the team finds that John was investigating an accidental explosion in a fireworks factory at the time. John was astonished by the finds of the case, where the explosives dealing license of the owner, Poozhimattom Thomachan ([[N. F. Varghese]]), was being employed for dealing with larger quantities of explosives driving terrorist activities in the State. He was killed for that matter and the CM was chosen for a strong deception. Also the enemy feared the CM, if John’s investigation report were to reach his hands.  Thomachan is a politician and was a Minister in Madhavan’s Ministry, but is too incapable a person, to have masterminded the brilliant scheme. The team’s most astounding find then follows, with the discovery of the puppet master and the silent partner in the illegal explosive deals of Thomachan. The Director General of Police (DGP) Hariprasad, who administered the investigation from the beginning, was the actual culprit they were after. He ([[Murali (Malayalam actor)|Murali]]) was the one who misled the previous investigation, initiated various attempts to murder Bharath (to scare the team away) and played the faithful ally throughout. The team submit the report and the guilty are put behind bars. The film ends with the team flying back to Delhi, with a promise of promotion to Pothuval, their local help.  
Tumbling Doll of Flesh
  Shown almost entirely though a stationary camera and a handheld one, the film has a woman named Kana and a man named Kiku being hired to star in an amateur porno being made by two men. As the porn shoot progresses, it incorporates elements of [[BDSM]], such as [[breast bondage]], multiple penetration with dildoes, [[wax play]], [[flagellation]], and an [[enema]]. Uncomfortable with how rough the film has gotten, Kana tries to leave, prompting the director, cameraman, and Kiku to knock her out, tie her to a bed, and strip her.  While Kiku rapes the semi-conscious Kana, the director cuts her left leg off with a meat cleaver, and mutilates her tongue with a knife, potato peeler, and shears to stop her screaming. When Kana passes out from the pain, she is injected with drugs to wake her up and keep her conscious. Kana's right arm and remaining leg are severed, and her abdomen is cut open so Kiku can have sex with her innards. After Kiku ejaculates blood-laden semen onto Kana's breasts, the director beats him over the head with the cleaver, and stabs Kana in the face with it. Kiku is then castrated by the director, who makes a telephone call while the cameraman continues filming the mangled bodies of their two stars.

Ultraman Tiga & Ultraman Dyna: Warriors of the Star of Light
  The members of Super-GUTS (Super Global Unlimited Task Squad) track a monster to the moon, where it battles Ultraman Dyna. This creature proves resilient to Dyna's usual finishing move, the Solgent Ray, but the monster was abruptly vaporized by a powerful yellow beam unleashed from a mysterious space battleship.  Upon returning to Earth, the Super-GUTS team goes to a secret island base. Here they discover that TPC (Terrestrial Peaceable Consortium), the parent organization of Super-GUTS, is responsible for building the space battleship. The ship known as Prometheus, and its devastating main weapon is the Neo-Maxima Cannon. The project leader, Dr. Kisaragi, explains that Super-GUTS has been summoned so that their brainwaves can be used to program the battle computer of Prometheus, making it an even more effective weapon.  The cocky young Asuka (Ultraman Dyna's human alter ego) doubts that Prometheus can ever be as effective as Dyna at defending the Earth.  He accepts the challenge, and his thoughts are fed into the ship's computer.  When Asuka regains consciousness, the base is attacked by aliens. Asuka transforms into Ultraman Dyna to face the alien UFO.  Prometheus is also launched, but to destroy Dyna, not assist him.  Dr. Kisaragi announces that both she and Prometheus are under the control of the alien race known as the Monera. The Prometheus, "Mollusionized" into a gigantic robot named Deathfacer, is able to anticipate and counter all of Dyna's moves due its programming based on Asuka's brain scan result. The one-sided battle ends when the Neo-Maxima Cannon devastates the island. Dyna disappears and is presumed dead.  While Super-GUTS regroups (they have all survived, including Asuka), the Monera announce that they will begin exterminating humanity at noon the next day. After talking with the original GUTS leader, Captain Iruma, Asuka regains his confidence and becomes Dyna-Strong type. This time, Dyna is ready for Deathfacer and shows the robot some devastating new tricks, as he defeats Deathfacer by driving his fist through Neo-Maxima Cannon during its charging sequence. Dyna then throws the unstable Deathfacer into the air, where it explodes. However, the Moneras combine their minds and bodies with their space ship to form the gigantic Queen Monera, which captures Dyna and instantly devastates the city. Dyna tries to escape, and Super-GUTS, as well as Captain Iruma, try to aid him, but Dyna's energy is drained completely and his timer runs out, seemingly killing him.  With Dyna defeated, all hope seems lost. However, a young boy with a Tiga figure is able to get everyone to believe in the light, as light itself came from the Tiga figure. This causes everyone to lend their light and brings back Ultraman Tiga, who frees and revives Dyna.  Ultraman Tiga and Dyna then proceed to fight together and defeat Queen Monera. Afterwards, Tiga and Dyna's light combine together and they disappear. The entire Super-GUTS reunite to celebrate their victory, as Iruma soon receives a visit later that day from the former GUTS members (with the notable exception of Daigo). At the end, Mai recovers from the previous attack of the Deathfacer and flies to the moon with Asuka as a passenger.

When Paul stops at a gas station, Natalie and Brenda discover Wexler's dead body in the car and flee, thinking Paul to be the killer.

When Natalie breaks into the building, she discovers the dead bodies of several of the murder victims, and Brenda lying on a bed. As Natalie starts crying, Brenda sits up and knocks her unconscious.

She grabs a scalpel and starts cutting Natalie's belly, almost reaching her belly button. Suddenly, Reese rushes in and forces Brenda away at gunpoint. Reese frees one of Natalie's hands; however, Brenda tries to stab her with a switchblade and the two struggle for Reese's gun. Brenda is able to shoot Reese and stops Natalie from escaping. Paul then appears and tries to trick Brenda into thinking that he will help her frame Wexler for the murders, but she doesn't believe him. As Brenda is deciding whether to shoot Paul or Natalie, the wounded Reese shoots Brenda in the elbow with another gun. Natalie grabs the gun and shoots Brenda, who falls through a window and onto the ground.  Natalie and Paul drive away to get help. Suddenly, Brenda appears in the backseat and attacks them with the axe. Paul swerves the car until he crashes on a bridge, sending Brenda through the windshield and into the river below. Brenda is believed to be dead and Natalie and Paul share an emotional embrace as police sirens are heard from the distance. The film's events are then revealed to be an urban legend being told among a different group of students at a different university, who say that Brenda's body was never found.

Only two members of the team survive, Jack Crow and Tony Montoya, as well as a prostitute named Katrina who was bitten by Valek. Crow later meets his boss, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Alba, who introduces him to Father Adam Guiteau.  After Crow reluctantly allows Guiteau to come along with him, he tells the priest some of his past, about how his father was bitten by a vampire, killed his mother and came after Jack, who ended up killing him. He then asks what it is Valek is after and Guiteau tells him that Valek is seeking an ancient relic called the Black Cross of Berziers and that Valek was once a fallen priest who was thought to have been possessed by demons. The Bérziers Cross was used in an exorcism that was cut short but the result was that Valek was forever changed into the first vampire.  Using the changing Katrina's mind, Jack, Montoya and Guiteau find out that Valek has seized the cross and they arrive at an old church to kill more vampires, but they are soon set up as Cardinal Alba sides with Valek and kidnaps Crow, revealing that his plan all along was being turned by Valek so he too can become immortal. Katrina turns into a vampire and allies herself with Valek after biting Montoya. Cardinal Alba agrees to perform a ritual using the cross which will allow vampires to walk in sunlight and be invulnerable, but Guiteau, who was in hiding, appears and kills him before he can finish the ritual. Montoya and Guiteau then rescue Crow as the sun rises, and Crow heads off to confront Valek, whom he kills by ramming the Berziers cross into his chest and exposing him to sunlight, which causes Valek to explode.  Guiteau realizes that Montoya is about to turn into a vampire now that he has been bitten by Katrina, but Crow knows that Montoya has been loyal to him and so decides to take Montoya's fate in his hands, telling Montoya that after two days he will hunt down and kill both him and Katrina.

The Waterboy
 Bobby Boucher ([[Adam Sandler]]) is a socially inept, [[stuttering]] 31-year-old [[water boy]] of the University of Louisiana's football program.<ref></ref> He lives with his overprotective mother, Helen ([[Kathy Bates]]), and believes his father, Robert Sr., died of [[dehydration]] in the [[Sahara]] while serving in the [[Peace Corps]].  As the players constantly bully Boucher, the Cougars' head coach, Red Beaulieu ([[Jerry Reed]]), fires Boucher, claiming he is disruptive. Bobby approaches Coach Klein ([[Henry Winkler]]) of the far more austere South Central Louisiana State University Mud Dogs and is hired as the team's water boy. The Mud Dogs have lost 40 consecutive games, their cheerleaders are alcoholics, and players are forced to share equipment due to budget cuts.  When the new team teases him, Klein encourages Bobby to stand up for himself, leading to him tackling and knocking out the team's [[quarterback]]. Bobby has repressed anger issues due to Helen's excessive sheltering and his years of being bullied. Seeing Boucher's potential, Klein meets with Helen and tries to persuade her to let Bobby play on the team, but she refuses, saying it is too dangerous.   Klein convinces Bobby to play without letting Helen know. Bobby becomes a feared [[linebacker]], with Klein telling him to visualize his enemies angering him and use the feelings for motivation. The Mud Dogs go on a winning streak. Bobby's newfound fame and confidence also allow him to reconnect with his childhood crush, Vicki Vallencourt ([[Fairuza Balk]]), who has been in prison multiple times. Helen forbids Bobby from seeing her, warning him that girls are "the devil".   The team's success earns it a trip to the annual [[bowl game|Bourbon Bowl]] to face the Cougars and Coach Beaulieu. Beaulieu and his team crash the Mud Dogs' [[pep rally]] and reveal that Bobby never finished high school since he was [[homeschooled]], and his high school transcript is fake, making him ineligible for college and football. The team and fans turn against him.   Coach Klein convinces NCAA to let Bobby play if he can pass a [[GED]] exam. He apologizes to Bobby and admits to submitting the fake transcript because he was desperate to get even with Beaulieu. Klein and Beaulieu used to be assistant coaches at the University of Louisiana. Beaulieu took credit for Klein's playbook, got promoted to head coach, and fired Klein.   The experience drove Klein to a mental breakdown, making him [[writer's block|unable to come up with new plays]]. The story convinces Bobby to help Klein get revenge on Beaulieu and prove himself to everyone. Helen nags Bobby while he is studying for the GED, driving him to angrily reveal to her that he has been playing football, going to college, and seeing Vicki, and intends to continue to doing so.  Bobby passes the exam, but Helen feigns a coma. Feeling he drove his mother to illness, Bobby stays in the hospital with her. Meanwhile, Vicki spreads word of Bobby passing the exam. This leads to a gathering of fans at the hospital who apologize for not supporting him and try to convince him to play. Seeing her son struggling to ignore his calling, Helen ends her fake illness. She tells Bobby his father, Robert Sr., was never in the Peace Corps, and in fact abandoned her while she was pregnant with Bobby to have an affair with a voodoo priestess. This led to Helen being constantly afraid that Bobby would leave her too. Having seen him being happy and making new friends, she realizes how selfish she has been, and encourages him to play in the Bourbon Bowl.  Arriving at halftime, Bobby finds the Mud Dogs losing 17-0. The team apologize for not treating him with the respect he deserves. With Bobby's help, Coach Klein overcomes his fear of Beaulieu by visualizing him as various things he's not afraid of, and comes up with new plays. The Mud Dogs begin to catch up, unsettling Beaulieu, who resorts to underhanded tactics. Helen helps by sobering up the team's cheerleaders in making coffee, while Vicki fills in for Bobby's usual waterboy duties. The Mud Dogs win the Bourbon Bowl by a score of 30-27. Bobby is named the [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]].  Some time later, Bobby and Vicki get married. Bobby's father Roberto makes a surprise appearance to convince Bobby to skip school and go to the NFL so he can share in his son's newfound fame, citing the success of [[Tiger Woods]] and [[Earl Woods|his father]]. He is tackled to the ground by an enraged Helen. Bobby and Vicki leave to consummate their marriage.  
Waking Ned
 When word reaches Jackie O'Shea ([[Ian Bannen]]) and Michael O'Sullivan ([[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]]), two elderly best friends, that someone in Tulaigh Mhór (Tullymore), their tiny Irish village of 52 people, has won the [[National Lottery (Ireland)|Irish National Lottery]], they, along with Jackie's wife Annie ([[Fionnula Flanagan]]), plot to discover the identity of the winner. They obtain a list of lottery customers from Mrs. Kennedy (Maura O'Malley) at the post office and invite the potential winners to a chicken dinner, where they attempt to get the winner to reveal him- or herself. After everyone has left and they are no closer to an answer, Annie realizes that one person did not come to the dinner, so Jackie pays a late-night visit to the only absentee: the reclusive Ned Devine (Jimmy Keogh). He finds Ned in his home in front of the TV, still holding the ticket in his hand, a smile on his face and dead from shock. That same night, Jackie has a dream that the deceased Ned wants to share the winnings with his friends, as he has no family to claim the ticket. Jackie wakes up after the dream, and before dawn, he and Michael return to Ned's house to gather Ned's personal information so they can claim the winnings for themselves.  Elsewhere in the village, Maggie O'Toole ([[Susan Lynch]]) continues to spurn the romantic interests of her old flame, "Pig" Finn ([[James Nesbitt]]), a local pig farmer. Finn is convinced they belong together, as he thinks he is the father of her son Maurice, but she cannot abide him due to his ever-present odour of pigs. Finn has a rival in Pat Mulligan ([[Fintan McKeown]]), also hoping to marry Maggie.  Jackie and Michael call the National Lottery to make the claim, prompting a claim inspector to be sent. The inspector, Mr. Kelly, arrives to find Jackie on the beach and asks him for directions to Ned's cottage. Jackie delays Kelly by taking him on a circuitous route while Michael races to the cottage on a motorcycle, completely naked, and breaks in so he can answer the door as Ned. After discovering that the lottery winnings are far greater than they anticipated (totaling nearly [[Irish Pound|IR£]]7 million), Jackie and Michael are forced to involve the entire village in fooling Mr. Kelly. All the villagers sign their name to a pact to participate in the ruse, except one—the local curmudgeon, Lizzie Quinn (Eileen Dromey). She threatens to report the fraud in order to receive a ten-percent reward, and attempts to blackmail Jackie for £1 million of the winnings. Jackie does not refuse her outright, but later insists to Michael, "She'll sign for the same as us, or get nothing at all!"  The villagers go to great lengths to fool the inspector, even pretending Ned's funeral is a service for Michael when the inspector wanders into the church. The inspector leaves, satisfied that the claim is legitimate, and the villagers celebrate their winnings at the local pub. Meanwhile, Quinn makes her way to the nearest working phone, a [[phone box]] outside the village on the edge of a cliff, and phones the lottery office. Before she can report the fraud, however, the departing claim inspector sneezes while driving past her and loses control of his car, forcing an oncoming van (driven by Tullymore's village priest, returning from a sabbatical) to crash into the phone box, sending it plummeting off the cliff and crashing to the ground below with Quinn still inside.  At the celebration, Jackie spots Maggie, who is content to marry Finn now that he has the money to give up pig farming. Maggie confides in him that Ned is Maurice's real father, meaning that Maurice is technically entitled to the entire winnings. Jackie urges her to claim the fortune for Maurice, but she demurs, determined to keep the secret so that Maurice will have a father and the villagers will have their money.  Finally, Jackie, Michael, Maurice, and several other villagers stand on a headland and raise their glasses to Ned, toasting him for his gift to the village.

Albert explains that this is a sign that the couple are truly soul mates. Annie decides that Chris cannot "see" the painting, however, and destroys it. At the same time, Chris sees his version of the tree disintegrate before his eyes.  Chris laments that he can no longer see his wife and soon encounters a woman who he comes to recognize as his daughter Marie, living in an area resembling a [[diorama]] that she loved in her lifetime. The two share a tearful reunion.  Meanwhile, Annie is wracked with guilt for the deaths of Chris and their children, believing that she was responsible for the chains of events which led to both car crashes (in reality, both were sheer bad luck), and  decides to commit [[suicide]]. Chris, who is initially relieved that her suffering is done, grows angry when he learns that those who commit suicide go to [[Hell]]; this is not the result of a judgment made against them, but rather their own tendency to create "nightmare" afterlife worlds based on their pain. Chris is adamant that he will rescue Annie from Hell, despite Albert's insistence that no one has ever succeeded in doing so with a suicide. Albert agrees to find Chris a "tracker" to help search for Annie's soul.  On the journey to Hell, Chris recalls his son, Ian. Remembering how he'd called him the one man he'd want at his side to brave Hell, Chris realizes that Albert is truly Ian. Ian explains that he chose Albert's appearance because he knew that Chris would listen to Albert without reservation. Before they part, Ian begs Chris to remember how he saved his marriage following Ian and Marie's deaths. Chris then journeys onward with the tracker.  Chris must walk across the field of Faces of the Damned, stepping on their faces as he navigates across it. The damned can be heard talking, including a businesswoman who says she never over-billed her clients. Chris and the tracker arrive at a dark and twisted version of Chris and Annie's house. The tracker then reveals himself as the real Albert and warns Chris that if he stays with Annie for more than a few minutes he may be permanently trapped in Hell, advising that all Chris can reasonably expect is an opportunity for a final farewell to Annie.  Chris enters their now-horrific looking home to find Annie suffering from [[amnesia]], unable to remember her suicide, and visibly tortured by her decrepit surroundings. Unable to stir her memories, the tracker sees Chris give up his quest to save Annie from Hell. But instead of returning to Heaven, Chris chooses to join Annie forever in Hell. As he declares to Annie his intent to stay, his words parallel something he'd said to her as he left her in an institution following the children's deaths, and she regains her memories while Chris is making her nightmare his. Annie, wanting nothing more than to save Chris, ascends to Heaven, taking Chris with her.  Chris and Annie are reunited with their children in Heaven, and all appearances are restored. Chris proposes [[reincarnation]], so he and Annie can experience life together again. The film ends with Chris and Annie meeting again as young children in a situation that parallels their first meeting.  
West Beirut (film)
 In April 1975, civil war breaks out; [[Beirut]] is partitioned along a Muslim-Christian line and is divided into East and West Beirut. After the line was created, Tarek is now considered to live in west Beirut (the Muslim part and Tarek is Muslim himself) and is in high school, making Super 8 movies with his friend, Omar. At first the war is a lark: school has closed (and is situated in east Beirut no longer accessible to Muslims since Christians build up walls to defend themselves), the violence is fascinating, getting from West to East is a game. His mother wants to leave the country; but his father refuses. Tarek spends time with May, a Christian, orphaned and living in his building. By accident, Tarek goes to an infamous brothel in the war-torn Olive Quarter, meeting its legendary madam, Oum Walid (name's translation: Walid's Mom). He then takes Omar and May there. Family tensions rise. Later on and as he comes of age, the war moves inexorably from adventure to a nationwide tragedy.  
The Wedding (miniseries)
 Shelby Cole ([[Halle Berry]]) returns to Martha's Vineyard and the Cole family home,in a section of town known as 'The Oval', to wed her white fiancé, jazz pianist and composer Meade Howell ([[Eric Thal]]). While her black high-society parents initially accept the pair, even arranging the wedding to be held at the mansion, they have growing misgivings as to the pair's ability to withstand the racial prejudice of the time, only made stronger after Meade admits that his own middle-class parents will not be attending the wedding because of their prejudice against their daughter-in-law-to-be.  Through frequent flashbacks throughout, we see the racial, societal and class choices made by Shelby's white great-grandmother on her mother's side ([[Shirley Knight]]), her grandparents and parents to insure the family's standing, even while those choices may have robbed them of the very happiness they sought.  While Shelby dismisses and even rebuffs much of their advice, her own doubts grow as she and Meade go through their own current experiences of racism and racial expectations.  Seeing her growing misgivings, Lute McNeil ([[Carl Lumbly]]), local architect, father and neighbor of the Coles, sees an opportunity to try to win Shelby's heart, having loved her from afar for some time.  With Lute's persistent, sometimes unwanted, attentions, Shelby starts to question her marrying Meade.  After a racist incident at a local restaurant, Shelby even confesses to Meade that she doesn't want to spend the rest of her life defending their relationship and asks him to give her time to finally decide.  Meanwhile, Shelby's mother Corinne ([[Lynn Whitfield]]) is battling her own demons within her marriage. Through the flashbacks, we see that her doctor husband Clark ([[Michael Warren (actor)|Michael Warren]]) married her not for love, but for her lighter-skinned looks and status. In the present, Corinne discovers that Clark is having an affair, planning to leave her for his longtime nurse-assistant, Rachel ([[Charlayne Woodard]]) after the wedding.  However, his inability to resolve his guilt about his marriage and children over the years, and several badly-timed phone calls during the wedding to her leave Rachel sadly resigned to the belief that he will never leave Corinne and she leaves him to marry another. On hearing this, Clark decides to try to spark the love in his marriage again with Corinne.  At the same time, Shelby's sister, Liz ([[Cynda Williams]]) has her own tribulations with her darker-skinned husband, Dr. Lincoln Odis ([[Richard Brooks]]). Lincoln's parents were disinvited from Liz and Lincoln's own wedding by Corinne. Corinne cites Lincoln's parents' discomfort with the local community as the reason, but in actuality Corinne disliked Lincoln's parents' working-class status.  That act remains a true bone of contention between Lincoln and Corinne, and he initially refuses to attend Shelby's wedding.  With prodding, however, from Liz re-affirming her love for him and explaining that her mother's actions, while horrid, were not at all her own feelings, he finally agrees to come.  Meanwhile, Lute has insisted his wife ([[Patricia Clarkson]]) give him a divorce because of her family's prejudice against him and her own ambivalence. Lute's wife has returned from New York to plead her case for reconciliation, suspecting that his request for a speedy divorce in Mexico is spurred by his desire to wed another woman. Lute in a rage forces her out of their home and tries to drive her to the ferry out of town, but in the process accidentally hits his youngest daughter with his car. The noise of their argument has brought out the surrounding neighbors, including Shelby, who, shocked by Lute's vehemence, feels that she 'finally can see who Lute really is', accepting that good character and heart, not race or class, make the human being and turns her heart back to Meade. The two marry in the end.

Whispering Corridors
 In an all-female high school in South Korea, the Jookran High School for Girls, teacher Mrs. Park, nicknamed "Old Fox" due to her sadistic method of teaching, circles several points in the students' yearbooks and calls her new fellow teacher, Hur Eun-young, who was her former student, that "Jin-ju, is definitely dead, but still attending school". Moments later, she is strangled with a noose by an unknown figure, her body discovered by three new senior students: the talented, superstitious artist Lim Ji-oh; the timid outsider, Yoon Jae-yi; and the sullen, unpopular Kim Jung-sook. Their teacher is now Mr. Oh, nicknamed "Mad Dog", who likes to give [[corporal punishment]]s to his students, as well as harassing the class' top scorer, Park So-young.  The discovery of Mrs. Park's body deeply impacts Ji-oh and she creates a painting of her body, which earns her a horrible punishment by Mr. Oh. Seeing Ji-oh dispirited, Jae-yi, a former artist, agrees to teach her painting at the storage room, which is rumored to be haunted. Ji-oh sees that So-young goes there to hide her [[smoking]] habit.  Eun-young suspects that Ji-oh may have been Jin-ju's ghost since she carries bells that Jin-ju, her friend from high school, gave her, though Ji-oh tells her that they were given Jae-yi. One night, Mr. Oh is terrorized by Jin-ju and killed by stabbing. The next night, Ji-oh finds Jung-sook and So-young bickering, ending with So-young storming out. Jung-sook commits suicide in a manner similar to Mrs. Park's: hanging herself by a noose.  So-young tearfully reveals to Eun-young that she used to be close to Jung-sook, but the teachers started comparing them and they drifted apart, with Jung-sook growing bitter and withdrawn. While painting, Ji-oh discovers a statue created by Eun-young for Jin-ju, as well as Mr. Oh's body. Jin-ju died in the storeroom while trying to save the statue; as it fell, she tripped, and everything came down, including the sculpting knives, which ultimately killed her. Eun-young learns from the yearbooks that since then, Jin-ju has entered the school year after year, posing as false students. She is currently posing as Jae-yi.   Eun-young is confronted by an angry Jae-yi/Jin-ju. Before Jin-ju can kill her, Ji-oh arrives and asks her to rest in peace. Jin-ju says that all she wanted was to live a normal high school life and have someone who could love her fearlessly as Eun-young couldn't. Jin-ju disappears after Ji-oh and Eun-young promise that they will correct the misgivings and that they will never forget her. The walls bleed blood while Eun-young and Ji-oh, tired, sit in the room, with Ji-oh resting her head in Eun-young's lap.  Eun-young and Ji-oh are still in the classroom when they are visited by a student the next day. The student leaves upon seeing the two, and as she turns around, it is revealed that she is Jung-sook's ghost.

At the same time, the CIA assigns another operative in South Africa for a more covert operation.  Jackie wakes up in a tribal village somewhere in the African [[veld]]t, still recovering from injuries sustained in an accident he cannot remember; as a result, when asked for his name by the natives, he responds by asking himself, "Who Am I?", and is referred to as that by the natives. The tribesmen show him the remains of a crashed helicopter and graves of those who perished aboard. He spends weeks recuperating from his wounds and learning about the tribe's culture.

Once he discovers Morgan's betrayal, "Who Am I?" tries to kill Morgan, but interrupted by Morgan's hitmen. After escaping from the building from a battle with Morgan's hitmen, "Who Am I?" regroups with Christine, who calls for the execution of a "Plan B", to surround the [[Erasmusbrug|Erasmus Bridge]] and corner Morgan.

Wild Things (film)
 A popular [[Miami]] area high school [[guidance counselor]], Sam Lombardo, is accused of [[Rape|rape]] by two female students, a wealthy and popular girl named Kelly Van Ryan and a poor outcast named Suzie Toller. He hires lawyer Kenneth Bowden to defend him. At trial, Suzie admits that she and Kelly had made everything up to get revenge on Lombardo: Suzie for him failing to bail her out of jail on a minor drug charge and Kelly for him having an affair with her mother, Sandra. Kelly's mother is humiliated by the scandal, and Lombardo and Bowden negotiate an $8.5 million settlement for [[defamation]]. In reality, Lombardo and the two girls were accomplices who used the trial as a way to get money from Kelly's wealthy family. To celebrate their success, [[Threesome|the three accomplices have sex]].  Police detective Ray Duquette, against the wishes of the district attorney's office, continues to investigate Lombardo.  He suspects the trio are working a scam, telling both Kelly and Suzie that Lombardo has already transferred the money to an off-shore account. Suzie panics and goes to Kelly for help. Kelly assures Suzie they can trust each other, but separately tells Lombardo over the phone that they may have to get rid of Suzie. Suzie overhears and attacks Kelly in the pool. Both women fight, but eventually end up kissing and having sex in the pool, all witnessed by Duquette, still investigating the trio. A few nights later, Lombardo and Kelly take Suzie to the beach and he kills her while Kelly waits nearby. After wrapping the body in plastic, they throw it in the trunk of the car and drive out to the swamp, where Lombardo disposes of it.  Duquette and his partner, Gloria, are called in to investigate Suzie's disappearance. Her blood and teeth are found at the beach while her car is found at a bus terminal. The D.A.'s office again insists that he drop the case, but Duquette asks his partner to watch Lombardo. Lombardo confronts Gloria and invites her in to read his school files on Kelly. She discovers that Kelly is a deeply troubled and violent girl made worse by the suicide of her father. Meanwhile, Duquette goes to Kelly's house to confront her. When he arrives, Kelly attacks him, shooting him in the arm. Duquette is left with no choice but to kill her in self-defense. No charges are filed against Duquette, but he is dismissed from the force for disobeying orders.  Sam returns to his beach bungalow to find Duquette taking a shower. They were partners, setting everyone up so they could split the money just two ways. Although Lombardo is not pleased Duquette killed Kelly instead of framing her as originally planned, he agrees that they now have fewer loose ends. The two agree to go fishing on Lombardo's sailboat, where Lombardo tries to eliminate Duquette. When Duquette fights back, he is shot and killed by a very much alive Suzie. She kills Duquette as revenge for killing Kelly and her friend, Davie, and for arresting her on a drug charge when he realized she had witnessed the murder (the arrest from which Lombardo had not bailed her out). Suzie then poisons Lombardo's drink and knocks him overboard, so his body won't be found.  A [[post-credits scene]] features a number of quick scenes that fill in details of the backstory. They reveal that Suzie has a genius I.Q., near 200, and was the ultimate architect of the entire plot. She now has control of all of the settlement money and has taken her revenge on both Lombardo and Duquette. She had been sleeping with Lombardo yet could not get him to bail her out, had discovered that Lombardo and Kelly were now sleeping together, and used it to pull him into her plot, starting with having him befriend Duquette. As for Kelly's death, she had not attacked Duquette as he had claimed. In reality, she tried to escape the guest house when he entered. He shot her dead, broke into her gun case and used her hand to shoot himself in the shoulder. In a final scene Bowden meets with Suzie, whose financial affairs he is handling. She kisses him on the cheek and as she walks off, Bowden telling her to "be good".

The X-Files (film)
 The film opens in 35,000 B.C., in what will become [[North Texas]]. Two cavemen hunters encounter a large [[extraterrestrial life]] form in a cave, which kills one and infects the other with a [[Black oil (The X-Files)|black oil]]-like substance. In 1998, in the same area, a boy falls into a hole and is also infected by a black substance which seeps from the ground. Firefighters who enter the hole to rescue him do not come out. A team of men wearing [[hazmat suit]]s arrive and extract the bodies of the boy and the firefighters. Meanwhile, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agents [[Fox Mulder]] and [[Dana Scully]], while investigating a [[bomb threat]] against a federal building in [[Dallas]], discover the bomb in a building across the street. As the building is evacuated, Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud remains, ostensibly to [[Explosive ordinance disposal|disarm]] the bomb. However, he simply waits for the bomb to detonate.  Mulder and Scully are later chastised because, in addition to Michaud, four other people were in the building during the bombing. That evening Mulder is accosted by a paranoid doctor, Alvin Kurtzweil, who explains that the "victims" were already dead, and that the bombing was staged to cover up how they died. At the hospital morgue, Scully is able to examine one of the victims, finding evidence of an alien virus. Meanwhile, the [[The Smoking Man|Cigarette Smoking Man]] goes to Texas, where Dr. Ben Bronschweig shows him one of the lost firefighters, who has an alien organism residing inside his body. He orders Bronschweig to administer a vaccine to it, but to burn the body if it fails. Later, the alien organism unexpectedly gestates and kills Bronschweig. Mulder and Scully travel to the crime scene in Texas, encountering the boys whose friend fell into the hole. Following their direction, they discover a large cornfield surrounding two glowing domes. Inside the domes, grates in the floor open and swarms of bees fly out. The agents flee, chased by [[black helicopter]]s, but manage to escape.  After returning to [[Washington, D.C.]], Scully attends a performance hearing, after which she is transferred. Mulder is devastated to lose his partner. The two are about to share a kiss when Scully is stung by a bee which had lodged itself under her shirt collar, and she quickly loses consciousness. Mulder calls paramedics, but the driver of the ambulance shoots Mulder and whisks Scully away. Mulder, not severely injured, slips out of hospital with the help of [[The Lone Gunmen]] and FBI Assistant Director [[Walter Skinner]]. He then meets a former adversary, the [[Well-Manicured Man]], who gives him Scully's location, along with a vaccine against the virus that has infected her. As Mulder leaves, the Well-Manicured Man kills himself in a car bomb, before his betrayal of [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|The Syndicate]] is discovered.  Mulder finds Scully underground in [[Antarctica]], in a large facility containing many humans in ice-like enclosures. He breaks Scully's confinement and uses the vaccine to revive her, but this disrupts the facility and [[Colonist (The X-Files)|cocooned aliens]] begin trying to escape. Just after the agents escape to the surface, a huge alien vessel emerges from beneath the ice and travels into the sky. Mulder watches it disappear into the distance as Scully regains consciousness. Some time later, Scully attends a hearing, where her testimony is disregarded and the evidence covered up. She hands over the only remaining proof of their ordeal, the bee that stung her, noting that the FBI is not currently capable of investigating this evidence. Outside, Mulder reads an article that has covered up the domes and crop field in Texas; Scully informs Mulder that she is willing to continue working with him.  At another crop outpost in [[Tunisia]], the Cigarette Smoking Man warns Strughold that Mulder remains a threat, as he explains what Mulder has found out about the virus. He then hands him a telegram revealing that the [[X-files unit]] has been re-opened.

At first, Woo expresses disinterest in the matchmaking mismatch. But when she's told that Tim is a [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]], she decides it is fate, jumps at the chance, and immediately heads for Tim's apartment. Meanwhile, Tim, who can't believe his luck, goes next door to his neighbor Darryl ([[LL Cool J]]) for tips on romancing women. Darryl supplies Tim with incense, edible body oils, and a tape of sexy songs. When Woo arrives, Tim is completely smitten. Woo, however, discovers that Tim is anything but the sexy, spontaneous stud of her dreams. Finding Tim's pseudo-cool act totally transparent, she humiliates and teases him. They are just about to exit Tim's apartment when Tim is visited by three of his pals - Frankie ([[Duane Martin]]), Hop (Darrel Heath), and Romaine ([[Michael Ralph]]). The [[male chauvinism|chauvinistic]] attitude of Tim's friends irritates Woo, so she retaliates and freaks out the trio by acting insane. Finally, the date gets underway. Woo and Tim arrive at a stuffy [[Italian food|Italian]] restaurant, but Woo's behavior gets them thrown out. They go to a dance club, where Tim becomes the victim, punched out by Woo's ex-boyfriend. Woo likes a good laugh, and when Tim discovers the theft of his flashy new car, she finds this hilarious. And so it goes, straight on till morning.  ===Subplot=== *Tim's friends: Frankie, Hop and Romaine have their own night of fun, gradually going to the same places Woo and Tim go. Unfortunately for them, they unwittingly go to a night club with mostly [[drag queen]]s, but Hop thinks they are really women and is ultimately horrified once he finds out the truth.

Wrongfully Accused
 World-famous violinist Ryan Harrison ([[Leslie Nielsen]], who had guest starred in two early episodes of ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' television series in the 1960s) is seen giving a concert. Afterwards, he goes to a party where he meets Hibbing Goodhue ([[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]]), a millionaire who sponsors Harrison's performances, as well as Goodhue's seductive wife Lauren ([[Kelly Le Brock]]) and his possible mistress Cass Lake ([[Melinda McGraw]]).  The next evening, he finds a note from Lauren in his car which summons him to the Goodhue residence. When he goes to the Goodhue mansion, he bumps into Sean Laughrea ([[Aaron Pearl]]), who has just killed Goodhue (together with an unknown accomplice). A violent fight follows, during which Harrison discovers that Sean is missing an eye, an arm, and a leg, and he overhears the preparations for an operation with the codename "Highlander" before he is knocked out. When he wakes up, Harrison finds himself arrested and convicted for the murder of Goodhue. Desperate to prove his innocence, Harrison escapes from his prison transport following an accident. Lieutenant Fergus Falls ([[Richard Crenna]]) arrives on the scene, takes charge, barks out orders and vows to do whatever it takes to capture the fugitive.  Harrison returns to the Goodhue mansion where he encounters Cass, who is trying to retrieve something from behind a portrait. She tells him she knows he is innocent and believes Lauren is the killer, but refuses to say anything to the police because Lauren is her sister. She provides him with a place to hide and helps him shake his pursuers, but Harrison's opportunities to rest are short and fleeting: Falls seems to find him wherever he goes, and Cass behaves suspiciously, increasing Harrison's doubts of whom to trust.  Harrison gradually begins to piece together the puzzle; he remembers that Sean was present at the party as the bartender and was given a great amount of money by Cass. He also finds that Cass is strangely interested in Sir Robert McKintyre, the [[secretary-general]] of the [[United Nations]]. Eventually, after investigating Sean's disabilities in a limb replacement clinic, he discovers that Cass, Lauren and Sean are planning an assassination attempt on McKintyre. He manages to follow the group but is caught. Cass shoots Harrison but actually fakes his death, both because she has fallen in love with him and because she wants to stop the assassination, since she has found out that McKintyre is really her father. Goodhue has been murdered by Sean and Lauren because he had come to suspect that his wife was actually a terrorist and had only used him to further her goals.  At a Scottish festival, Harrison and Cass just barely manage to save McKintyre's life. They are cornered by Lauren, Sean and accomplices, but Fergus Falls and a SWAT team arrive just in the nick of time, arresting the terrorists. Falls officially tells Harrison that he was "wrongfully accused", clearing his name and acquitting him. In the last scene, Harrison and Cass are riding on the bow of a cruise ship (spoofing ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'') and end up bumping their heads on a low bridge.  
World War III (film)
 The movie opens with clips of the US military scrambling to respond to a Soviet nuclear attack. [[Daniel Schorr]], reporting in front of the [[White House]], is vaporized when a nuclear weapon detonates.  In the summer of 1989, [[East Germany]] is in turmoil. Many citizens are dissatisfied with their nation’s [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Communist]] leadership and seek [[German reunification|reunification]] with [[West Germany]]. On October 7, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], a supporter of those reforms, visits [[East Berlin]]. During his return flight, the [[State Committee on the State of Emergency|hard-line Communist leadership]] stages a coup that deposes Gorbachev and installs (fictional) General Vladimir Soshkin as the new Soviet leader; Gorbachev's eventual fate is "lost in the darkness of history".  Soshkin and the hard-liners fiercely resist the rise of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]]. They are determined to end the uprisings in East Germany and the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]] with a swift [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Chinese-style military crackdown]] in late October. (In East Germany at least, the crackdown is not limited to demonstrators; numerous moderate Communists such as [[Egon Krenz]] and [[Günter Schabowski]] are "disappeared", never to be heard from again.) The crackdown inflames popular opposition to communism. In late November, a [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|demonstration in Leipzig]] is brutally repressed by the [[National People's Army|East German Army]] at great loss of life. Two days later, a demonstration at the [[Brandenburg Gate]] ends with East German soldiers killing many East Berlin residents trying to scale the [[Berlin Wall]] and a West German cameraman filming the events. Those soldiers also fire shots over the wall into West Berlin. Soon after, the East German government responds to the international condemnation of their conduct by ordering all foreign journalists out of the country.  In mid-December, [[NATO]] airlifts military reinforcements to West Berlin. Soon after, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James Baker III|James Baker]] arrives in West Berlin to secretly meet with General Dmitry Leonov, the Soviet commander in East Germany, who strongly opposes Soshkin's crackdown. However, on the way to the meeting, Leonov is killed by a car bomb, for which a West German [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] group claims responsibility. After an interview with West German TV in which Soshkin implicitly threatens West Berlin, an American colonel orders that [[tactical nuclear weapons]] in West Germany be placed on high alert it shows scenes of what appears to be a Pershing 1a or 2 being prepared. Soshkin responds with new threats, a massive deployment of the Soviet submarine fleet, and incursions of Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-95|Bear bombers]] into [[Alaska|Alaskan]] airspace.  On January 25, 1990, East German troops cut off transportation and supply links between West Germany and West Berlin, and the [[Soviet Air Force]] mobilizes to close off East Germany's airspace. Soshkin hopes the plan will prevent the West from entering into the Soviet sphere of influence and cut Berlin off from the West. NATO forces start a full-scale deployment into West Germany, and many citizens in West Germany are preparing shelters should the worst come.  As the United States prepares their first military convoy [[Exercise Reforger|across the North Atlantic]], the Soviets announce their intention to blockade the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] transports. Soshkin desires to cut off Western Europe and weaken the NATO buildup. The US and Britain condemn the blockade and declare it to be an act of hostility. On February 18, the United States Navy violates the blockade, and US ships are attacked by Soviet forces. Nearly a quarter of the convoy is lost in the ensuing battle before American and NATO forces clear the sea lanes. Shortly afterwards, the [[United Nations Security Council]] holds an emergency session in New York City in the hopes of diffusing the hostilities between the superpowers, but proves fruitless when neither side refuses to back down until other does so. War at this point seems inevitable.  The world panics after the failed session and the United States dispatches (fictional) [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] Martin Jacobs to the Soviet Union for last ditch effort talks with Soshkin. Figuring that Soshkin knows that the Soviets were losing power in Eastern Europe, Jacobs offers Soshkin an extended timetable for the Soviet withdrawal from Eastern Europe in exchange for a [[de-escalation]] of the military buildup. Soshkin refuses him utterly, and thus, [[World War III]] begins.  ===The battle for Germany=== {{Infobox military conflict | conflict= World War III (fictional) | partof= | image= | caption= | date= February 18 – April 1, 1990 <br>(1 month and 14 days) | place= Initially [[Germany]]; eventually [[Europe]], [[North America]], and the [[Soviet Union]] | causes= Rise of belligerent, hardline communism in the Soviet Union that lead to global political instability | result=  * Initially, dissolution of East Germany and its impending reunification with West Germany. * Ultimately, a global [[thermonuclear war]]. | combatant1= <br>''including''<br><br><br><br> [[Polish government-in-exile|Polish resistance movement]]<br> [[Royal Netherlands Army]] units | combatant2= [[Warsaw Pact]]<br>''including''<br><br> |Commanders and leaders | commander1= '''NATO bloc'''<br> [[George H.

The landings catch NATO off-guard, and they scramble forces northward to push back the beachhead. The next day, [[Warsaw Pact]] ground forces drive through the [[Fulda Gap]], with orders to push to the [[Rhine]] to divide the stretched out NATO armies. Meanwhile, the Soviet Air Force bombards [[Ramstein Air Base]] and other NATO bases in Germany. The goal is to cripple the NATO buildup with a swift strike and then press for a new round of diplomatic bargaining from a stronger strategic position. NATO forces, faced with superior numbers and surprise, are pushed back, though they are able to inflict significant losses on the Warsaw Pact forces. By March 17, Warsaw Pact forces have advanced 50 miles into West Germany.  While preparing to launch a [[Tactical nuclear weapon|tactical nuclear]] counter-assault, NATO authorizes a last-ditch conventional air campaign, Operation Bloody Nose, launched 24 hours before the nuclear strikes were to begin. It is an overwhelming success: the initial strikes cripple Warsaw Pact [[command and control]] posts, throwing their armies in the field into chaos, and in the ensuing air battle, NATO inflicts devastating losses on the Soviet Air Force (which had already lost 20% of the aircraft supporting the initial offensives), gaining [[air supremacy]] over Eastern European airspace. Combined with assistance from the [[Polish government-in-exile|Polish underground]] that cuts off Soviet supply lines, the tide of the war turns. With their numerical superiority negated by the Western technological superiority, the East German and Soviet armies melt under NATO air strikes, and NATO forces cross into East Germany on March 23.  ===Global thermonuclear war=== NATO forces reach and liberate West Berlin on March 27. As the Soviets withdraw to [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], Germans begin to hope that reunification is at hand. The American leadership tries to reassure Soshkin that NATO had no intention to press their advance beyond East Germany. However, unrest erupts across the [[Eastern Bloc]] as citizens of communist nations, and ethnic minorities within the Soviet Union, press for the overthrow of their leaders. Soshkin becomes desperate as the communist bloc falls apart around him, and he becomes paranoid that NATO will exploit the situation to fight all the way to Moscow.  As a [[show of force]], on March 31 Soshkin orders a symbolic nuclear strike above the [[North Sea]]. The United States responds by going to [[DEFCON|full nuclear alert]] and preparing to execute the [[Single Integrated Operational Plan]]. On April 1 (ironically [[April Fools' Day|April Fools Day]]), a Soviet radar post suffers an equipment malfunction. Falsely believing that the USSR is under nuclear attack, Soshkin orders an all-out [[Second strike|retaliatory nuclear strike]] against the West, at [[Dombarovsky Air Base|Dombarovsky]] rocket base the alarms go off and army personnel rush to their stations silo doors slide open, and SS-18 Satan missiles launch out of them heading for the USA  the United States and NATO respond in kind showing scenes of [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]], [[UGM-73 Poseidon|Poseidon]], [[Trident (missile)|Trident]], [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman]] and [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|Peacekeeper]] missiles being launched as keys turn. [[Nuclear holocaust|Thousands of nuclear devices are launched]] across the Northern Hemisphere. "[[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth|There is no further historical record of what happens next"]] meaning that either civilization was wiped out or destroyed to a large extent.  ===Epilogue=== The movie then rewinds to Gorbachev’s visit to East Germany. Archival footage is shown of the celebrations of the [[Berlin Wall#Fall of the Berlin Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]] and the peaceful [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]]: "History...took a different course.".  
The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit
 Jose Martinez ([[Clifton Collins Jr.]]) is a poor young man living in East Los Angeles who is in love with the girl next door. He encounters a strange man eyeing him and runs away, and throwing his wallet with his last $20 to escape. When cornered in the alley he is given back his money where the man measures his body frame. This man is Gómez ([[Joe Mantegna]]) who introduces himself and then whisks Martinez off to a run-down bar. There he meets two other similarly-sized Latinos, Dominguez ([[Esai Morales]]), a wandering guitar player, and Villanazul ([[Gregory Sierra]]), a burgeoning philosopher and speaker for the people.  Barely letting the dust settle, Gómez shows them that they all have the same measurements, height, and weight. It is at that moment that Gómez shares his vision. The most beautiful, exquisite, vanilla-ice-cream-white summer suit is for sale at the downtown suit emporium. It is one of a kind and costs only $100. Alone, none of them have enough to purchase the suit, but by combining their money, they may be able to own the one-of-a-kind suit together. Each of the four has only $20, leaving them with $80 – just $20 short. They need one more person to complete their dream. In their haste, they choose to go along with a bum outside, Vámonos ([[Edward James Olmos]]), who has the last $20 they need.  Once they buy the suit, they work out a system to decide who will wear it. Each partner will get to wear it for the entire night, one night a week. However, on the first night, they will each wear it for one hour, then return to the bar. Dominguez goes first, and stirs up a parade with his guitar playing, inspiring those who hear it to ''¡Muévete!'' Villanazul is second, and during his hour he interrupts a politician on a soapbox to perform a poem he has written. Martinez, third in line, returns to the balcony where he first saw the girl next door. While she had previously not noticed him (because she did not have her glasses on), this time the bright white suit attracts her attention and Martinez gets her name: Celia Obregon.  Gómez is next. Acting on an earlier hunch that Gómez's plan was a scam to get the money from the others to buy the suit and then leave town, Villanazul reminds Gómez to "go with God." This was indeed the plan all along, but on the way to the bus station, Gómez encounters a mural of five men, each resembling a member of their group. Gómez decides not to leave, and returns.  Finally it is Vámonos's turn. Gómez is infuriated that the filthy Vámonos did not get clean before it was his turn. Along with the others, they force Vámonos to take a bath, something he hadn't done in years. Once clean, Gómez lays down a series of rules, aimed at keeping the suit clean: no eating juicy tacos, drinking wine, smoking cigars, even standing under trees with birds. Furthermore, he insists that Gómez avoid meeting with a woman named Ruby Escadrío, whose boyfriend, Toro, would ruin the suit in a fight. Vámonos heads off to a club. He is followed by the other four members, who watch him ignore every one of Gómez's rules.  Ruby Escadrío shows up, and she and Vámonos dance. Toro, predictably, is angry. The others protect Vámonos from Toro, Gómez even going so far as to insist Toro hit him instead of Vámonos. The fight ends after Toro hits Vámonos with his car. His leg is broken, but Vámonos insists that they quickly take off the suit before the ambulance arrives, because the paramedics would cut the suit off and ruin it. They do, and Vámonos is rushed to the hospital.  In the final scene, Dominguez has ironed the suit and placed it on a mannequin. As the scene continues, it becomes apparent that the suit is one of the few things the group has left: they are sleeping on a rooftop, with only a few hammocks between them. Vámonos is fine, though his leg is still in a cast. Martinez contemplates that if they were rich, they would never have had the great time they have spent together, before Villanazul tells him to get some sleep.  
X2000
 A naked man ([[Bruno Slagmulder]]) wakes up in a luxury [[loft]], which is a residential building in an unidentified European city, after a particularly wild New Year's Eve party of the year 2000. He finds a naked woman ([[Denise Aron-Schropfer]]) in his bed, and obviously he does not recognize or remember her. He walks naked through the apartment and discovers a pair of partygoers – two young boys, identical twins ([[Lionel Le Guevellou]] and [[Olivier Le Guevellou]]), in a sleeping bag, hugging each other. He looks out the window and recognizes a man ([[Flavien Coupeau]]) and woman ([[Lucia Sanchez]]) making love in the apartment across the street, while the woman who was sleeping beside him wakes up and takes a bath. While he looks at what is happening across the street, he falls off the table he was sitting on, and lands on the floor, breaking a glass. This noise wakes up the twins. He goes into the kitchen to throw the pieces of broken glass away, and discovers ants underneath the garbage can. He goes into the bathroom and tells the women in the bath about the plague of ants in the kitchen.  
The Wounds
 ''Rane'''s opening sequence announces it as being "dedicated to the generations born after [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]". The film follows the fate of two boys, Pinki and Švaba, growing up in [[Novi Beograd]] during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] period (1991–96).  Pinki was born on 4 May 1980, the day Yugoslav president [[Josip Broz Tito]] died, and was given his unusual name by his father Stojan Mučibabić, an idealistic, impulsive, and patriotic officer of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) who is deeply devoted to communist ideals and Marshal Tito. Father's first choice for his firstborn's name was actually Tito, but the officials at the municipal office thought it provocative and inappropriate in the time of grieving so he eventually settled on Pinki after local communist [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisan]] [[Boško Palkovljević Pinki|fighter]]. Meanwhile, Pinki's best friend Švaba is raised and cared for only by his grandmother, a [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serb]] who fled to Serbia during [[World War II]] after [[World War II persecution of Serbs|persecution]] from the Croatian fascist movement [[Ustaše]].  Living in the block of apartment buildings in Novi Beograd's neighbourhood of [[Paviljoni]], both kids are extremely juvenile, though Pinki is a bit more thoughtful and articulate while Švaba is moody, impulsive, and prone to anger outbursts. The duo also has another friend in the neighbourhood — Dijabola, an eager, geeky, and bespectacled outsider whose sexy and aloof mother Lidija is a well-known television host. Though they hang out with him, Pinki and Švaba mostly treat Dijabola badly. He is constantly the butt of their insults and occasionally even gets beaten up by them.  The story begins in the late summer of 1991 as the kids watch Serbian troops (regular JNA troops and various volunteer militias) going off to war in neighbouring Croatia where the [[Battle of Vukovar]] is raging. Pinki's father Stojan is extremely frustrated about being forced into early retirement by the JNA army and thus missing the chance to go to war. He spends his days glued to the television set, watching news reports from Vukovar and cheering on the JNA. By now he has transformed into a nationalist and has become extremely irritable, getting into petty quarrels with neighbours and venting his anger along the ethnic and political lines. He has also found a new idol - instead of Tito he's now a huge supporter of [[Slobodan Milošević]]. Pinki, for his part, is mostly oblivious to the events around him as he spends most of his time compulsively masturbating.  By 1992 and 1993, Serbia is under a [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757|UN trade embargo]], and the war has spread from Croatia to Bosnia as well. Entering their early teens, Pinki, Švaba and Dijabola begin their fascination with a neighbour across the street Kure who drives a nice car, makes regular robbing excursions to Germany while dating a trashy [[kafana]] singer. They're deeply impressed with his swagger and lifestyle and are ecstatic one day when he invites them to unload his car that's full of stuff he brought over from Germany. In fact, he sends Dijabola away and picks only Švaba, but then upon Švaba's suggestion tells Pinki to come along as well.  Like many of their peers, Pinki and Švaba enter the world of crime at fourteen years of age in an ex-communist community that is in hyper-transition, which, because of war and sanctions, reminds the two friends of a theater of the absurd. The idols of the main characters are famous [[Belgrade]] gangsters and a TV show called ''Puls Asfalta'' (''Pulse of the Asphalt'') which features criminals and turns them into media stars. Pinki and Švaba fantasize of being on the show one day and they attempt to be noticed by its producers by committing crimes. After they succeed in establishing themselves as influential criminals and drug dealers, their uprising in the world of crime is cut by mutual conflict as both start having sex with Lidija. Švaba shoots Pinki five times in the [[Stigmata|same places]] that [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] was wounded two thousand years ago. Pinki manages to survive and after some time he escapes from the hospital, and calls his friend to make peace. The truce is more than terrible, as the wounded boy has, after an unwritten rule, to inflict five identical wounds to his friend, so the friendship can be rebuilt. After shooting Švaba three times, he considers wounding him one more time instead of the required two. They are suddenly interrupted by a furious Dijabola who shoots at them, especially Švaba, for killing his mother. A shootout occurs and Švaba and Dijabola are killed. In the end, Pinki, who is wounded and is lying on the ground, laughs at the audience by claiming that he "made out better than you."  
You've Got Mail
 Kathleen Kelly is involved with Frank Navasky, a leftist newspaper writer for ''[[The New York Observer]]'' who is always in search of an opportunity to root for the underdog. While Frank is devoted to his typewriter, Kathleen prefers her laptop and logging into her [[AOL]] email account. Using the [[User (computing)|screen name]] "Shopgirl", she reads an email from "NY152", the screen name of Joe Fox, whom she first met in a chatroom known as Over 30. As her voice narrates her reading of the email, she reveals the boundaries of their online relationship: no specifics, including no names, career or class information, or family connections.  Joe belongs to the Fox Family that runs Fox Books, a chain of mega bookstores. Kathleen runs the independent bookstore called The Shop Around the Corner that her mother ran before her. The two are shown passing each other on their respective ways to work, revealing that they frequently live in the same neighborhoods in the [[Upper West Side]] of Manhattan. Joe arrives at work, overseeing the opening of a new Fox Books in New York City with the help of his best friend, branch manager Kevin. Kathleen and her three store assistants, Christina, George and Aunt Birdie, open up her small shop that morning.  Following a day with his 11-year-old aunt Annabel and his 4-year-old half-brother Matthew, Joe enters Kathleen's store to let his younger relatives experience story time. Joe and Kathleen have a conversation that reveals Kathleen's fears about the Fox Books branch opening around the corner. He omits his last name and makes an abrupt exit with the children before she could discover who he is. At a publishing party for New York book business people later that week, Joe and Kathleen meet again where Kathleen discovers Joe's true identity. She accuses him of deception and spying, while he responds by belittling her store. They begin to publicly avoid each other while they unknowingly continue to see each other online.  The Shop Around the Corner slowly goes under following Fox Books' success. On her shop's last night in business, Kathleen enters Fox Books to discover the store is friendly and relaxed, yet without the same dedication to or knowledge of children's books as her shop. Her employees move on: Christina goes job hunting, George gets a job at the children's department at the Fox Books store, and Birdie retires.  When the two finally decide to meet, Joe discovers that his online correspondence is Kathleen. He initially decides not to meet her, but ultimately joins her without revealing his online identity, leading them to clash once more. Joe later resumes their correspondence as NY152, apologizes, and promises to eventually tell her why "he stood her up".  After both break up with their significant others, Joe realizes his feelings towards Kathleen after a conversation with his father and begins building a face-to-face relationship with her, still keeping his online identity a secret. He arranges a meeting between her and NY152, but just before she is about to meet the latter, he reveals his feelings for her. Confused with her feelings for Joe, Kathleen decides to go anyway. Upon arriving at the meeting place, she realizes that Joe and NY152 are the same person when he called for his pet dog Brinkley, whose name he initially revealed online, and admits that she "wanted it to be him".  
Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl
 Xiu Xiu (), a 15-year-old girl living in the city of [[Chengdu]], moves out to study horses in the countryside with a nomadic Tibetan. She is told that after six months, she will return to take charge of her all-girl cavalry unit. Her only friend is the [[eunuch]] horseman, Lao Jin, who takes care of her while teaching her to herd horses. However, after the six months are up she quickly discovers that she is not returning.  As Xiu Xiu loses hope, she falls for the lies of a peddler who tells her he can get her out of the place, but does not return after having sex with her. Her innocence is slowly corrupted by a stream of men who use her only for sex, barely keeping up the conceit by telling her that they are able to get her back to her hometown. Lao Jin, emasculated and docile, can only watch in sadness as Xiu Xiu loses hope in the system and in herself. Xiu Xiu even starts to believe in the lies the men perfunctorily tell her, as she spitefully lectures Lao Jin that the men who come in the night and have their way with her are important men who can help her get back.  Xiu Xiu gets pregnant and has to go for a traumatic abortion in the hospital. The female doctors gossip about Xiu Xiu. After the operation, she gets raped by one of the patients, a man who shot himself in the foot to get handicapped benefits in the state-controlled economy. Lao Jin gets angry and assaults the rapist, but he is restrained by the other patients while the doctors make snide remarks about how Xiu Xiu enjoys being raped.  After Xiu Xiu recuperates, she tries to shoot herself in the foot so she can get sent back home, but she cannot bring herself to pull the trigger. She asks Lao Jin to shoot her foot. But she decides against it and intimidates him to shoot her dead instead. Lao Jin shoots her, then shoots himself and falls on her body so they can be finally together in death.  
Young and Dangerous 5
  The story involves Chan Ho-Nam ([[Ekin Cheng]]) competing for control of [[Causeway Bay]] with Szeto Ho-Nam of the Tong Sing gang([[Mark Cheng]]).  Meanwhile, the Chinese-Malaysian governor ([[Paul Chun]]) has set up Ho-Nam involving real-estate fraud.  The story starts with Chan Ho-Nam, Hung Hing's dragonhead Chiang Tin Yeung and Ben Hon talking about the shifting tide for the Triads once the passover of power back to Mainland China once 1997 reaches. Chiang Tin Yeung advice Ho-Nam that the days of yesteryear for gangsters are gone as everything has to be kept underground even more while nothing is more important than making money and it doesn't hurt to make friends with rich people. Soon after, Pou-pan saw a woman drinking a spiked drink and was acting wildly under the influence of drug and trying to control the situation, he got into an altercation together with Jiu-Pei (Banana Skin) and as things started to escalate, Szeto Ho-Nam, Tong Sing's leader fighting for the control of Causeway Bay from Chan showed up and goaded Chan. Before things could escalate even further, new OCTB inspector, Lee, came and stopped them both from escalating the matter. With Szeto backing out and leaving, Lee warned that due to Chan's fame in both the Causeway Bay area, if anything was to go wrong there, he will be the 1st to arrest Chan for questioning while giving Chan his personal number in case anything goes wrong in his territory. Soon, Chiang Tin Yeung brought Ben Hon, Key and Ho-Nam to Malaysia for a charity event where Ho-Nam was acquainted with a rich Datuk, Chan Ka-Nam and soon both became friends. Ka-Nam talked into Ho-Nam into being a partner of his newest venture in Hong Kong, a cruise ship and under the previous advice he got from Chiang, Chan Ka-Nam agrees to the partnership. In the event, Chan met eyes with Uncle Seven's "god daughter", Mei Ling and both of them flirted with each other secretly.  In Hong Kong, an old-time friend of Chan, Dai-Tau (Big Head), who became a scapegoat for the murder both him and Chan did and sentenced to 9 years in jail prior to the movie, was released from prison and was selling newspaper under a bridge in Chan's territory. Chan spotted him and both went for morning Dim Sum where both talked about the time where Dai-tau decided to be the scapegoat when promised to be promoted to a higher position and the jail time will be less instead of the 9 years he got. Despite constant pleading by Ho-Nam, Jiu-Pei and Pou-Pan, Dai-Tau was adamant about re-entering the gangster lifestyle while remaining to sell his newspaper. However due to his past haunting him and Szeto's rivalry with Chan, Dai-Tau was constantly harassed by Szeto's men and even got his entire booth burnt, only for Jiu-Pei and Pou-Pan coming to the rescue too late. Having enough of the nonsense, Dai-Tau joined Hung Hin again under Ho-Nam.  A few months go by and during a drinking session between Ho-Nam, Ben-Hon, Key and Ka-Nam. Halfway into the session, Ho-Nam received a phone call and rushes out leaving Ben-Hon to clear the bill. Soon it was clear that Ho-Nam went to the police station to bail out Mei Ling who was caught using counterfeit US notes. After bailing her out, taking pity on her, he brings Mei Ling to his house to have dinner with his buddies and their grandma and they had a good time. Soon time passed and the cruise ship was launched. Everything seemed well but Szeto gatecrashed the open ceremony and Chan nearly butted heads with him again only to have Ka-Nam stopping Chan from turning violent while explaining he invited Szeto as they had an idea to host a boxing match on the ship. Dai-Tau, being one of the best fighter and the newest member in Chan's party, volunteered to fight in the upcoming boxing match. Few hours has passed and the ship's casino was running. Mei Ling, who was accompanying Uncle Seven to the opening ceremony, was caught cheating at the poker tables and Chan pulled her aside for questioning. When Chan pulled her into an empty room, she revealed that she did that in order to make love with Chan as she has fallen for him but still remembering his deceased girlfriend, Smartie, he backed out and told her to return to Uncle Seven. As Chinese New Year was coming, Chan brought his brothers and grandma to their own restaurant for a reunion dinner but below the restaurant, they met Mei Ling. Bewildered, Chan asked Mei Ling what she was doing there where she retorted back that she knew Chan will be there so she stalked him there uninvited. However, Chan relented and asked her up for dinner also under the "orders" of grandma. However, upon reaching the restaurant, Chan and the gang found out that guests were all being held up outside the restaurant. Chan asked the manager what was happening and he mentioned that the restaurant was being messed with and it turned out to be Szeto and his men. Feeling annoyed, Chan asked them to leave but after failing to, he called Inspector Lee and soon, Lee cleared the whole ground of Szeto's men. After dinner, Chan brought Mei Ling to the flower market and as they were walking, Mei Ling again hinted on how much she loved Chan. She also told Chan that she knew who Smartie was and her terrible death and the sole reason on why Chan is not in another relationship. Undeterred, she inches closer to kiss Chan after making a joke about a [[Marlboro]] signboard and on the countdown of the New Year timer, they locked lips and kissed.  A day has passed and Hon-Nam was making rounds with his buddies across Causeway Bay, thanking anyone who supported him and soon, returned to the new company he had with the new business he had with Ka-Nam. Out of curiosity, Dai-Tau took a look at the agreement Ho-Nam and Ka-Nam signed and realized something was odd as the agreement mentioned nothing of the cruise ship partnership that Ho-Nam was a partner of but instead on only the property business which Ho-Nam also had a part on. Thinking it made not much difference, Ho-Nam assured Dai-Tau that nothing was wrong but the next moment, Commercial Crime officers entered the office and arrested Ho-Nam on the pretext of commercial fraud and was questioned the whole night in the police station. While still being locked away, Szeto's men created a ruckus at the bus depot where Chan was controlling and to protect the business, Jiu-Pei led some men and retaliated against Szeto's men. OCTB and police officers soon arrived and as the crowd disperses into different directions, Jiu-Pei, one of Szeto's man and his injured brother were arrested with the injured laying beside a bus with blood flowing from his head and in a comatose state after constant ramming by Jiu-Pei. When day arrived, Ho-Nam was released after questioning and Inspector Lee came to pick him up while telling him that his men had created trouble in the territory and despite him not calling the shots while being in the station, as he's the boss, he has to be questioned. As Lee led Ho-Nam back to his office, they heard gunshots from the direction of Lee's office and as they rushed over, they were told that the gangster arrested with Jiu-Pei has received news that his brother was dead by a police officer and in a fit of anger and revenge, he snatched a police officer's revolver and fired 3 rapid shots at Jiu-Pei who collapsed and died.  The next day saw the whole of Ho-Nam's gang and Jiu-Pei's relatives trying to enter the police station to pay respect to him but Lee denied them entrance and told them that if they want to offer prayer and pay their final respect, they can do it outside the station's gate and warned Ho-Nam that his "Underground Rules" does not apply on him. Having learnt that Ka-Nam had cheated him, Chan brought Pou-Pan and Dai-Tau to confront Ka-Nam only to learn that he was tricked all along and Ka-Nam had always been working with Szeto and felt betrayed when Mei Ling was revealed by Ka-Nam that she was told to seduce Chan in order to get info from him. Soon, in order to win the fight, both Dai-Tau and Ho-Nam trained hard for the fight and while Chan was resting and watching the scenery of Hong Kong alone, Szeto appeared and made a side bet with Chan that if his fighter, Ho-Yong, loses, he will leave Causeway Bay for good. During the press conference about the upcoming fight, everything seemed to be going well but then a reporter, a mole planted by Ho-Nam with the help of Tai-Fei ([[Anthony Wong Chau-sang]]), spilled the beans of Ka-Nam's misdeeds such as fraud and murder of a Malaysian official who was on his case. Worse still, Mei Ling also managed to find Ka-Nam's wife who was expelled off to Sabah and call her back to Hong Kong to spread his evil deeds. With issues mounting, Ka-Nam pleaded with Szeto to ask for manpower to protect him but Szeto quickly debuffs Ka-Nam and simply walked away. Delaying time to make his personal escape, Ka-Nam lied and tried to flee from the back but was instead blocked by Pou-Pan and was beaten up by him with a aluminium baseball bat.  With the sponsor Ka-Nam gone, the boxing event still goes on and while Dai-Tau was ready, Szeto's fighter, Ho-Yong, was late and worse still, was caught by Szeto to be late for no other reason than to date a Caucasian girl. The match starts with Dai-Tau entering the match first and Ho-Yong second. While Dai-Tau was warming up, Ho-Yong goaded at the entire of Hung Hing and suddenly assaulted the unready Dai-Tau in the back which caused both sides having a brawl in the ring. After calming down, the ring was cleared and the match started. With the main match going on, Szeto and Chan went to the back and had a fight of their own. The main match saw Dai-Tau nearly losing the 1st round to Ho-Yong but right before the second match, it was revealed that the Caucasian girl was all along a spy working for Hung Hing under Sister 13 and after having sex with the Caucasian girl 7 times the previous night, Ho-Yong went limp and exhausted which saw Dai-Tau gaining an upper hand. In the meantime, Ken, Ben-Hon and Tai-Fei were looking at the stadium from a van when Inspector Lee entered the stadium with a bunch of riot police. In the 3rd round, Dai-Tau gained the upper hand and after a series of solid punches, he uppercut Ho-Yong and beat him to a knockout. After the match, the whole ring was up in brawl again and it soon turned out that Inspector Lee came to the match already predicting a gang fight and soon ordered him men to enter the ring and make arrests. With the mess still going on, the back stage fight between Szeto and Chan exploded into the main stage with the burst of the doors and both were soon fighting on the boxing ring. When Lee arrived with his subordinates, he was confused to what was happening but instead of making arrest, he told his men to let them both continue fighting. Chan was losing the fight but after dodging Szeto's few blows, he retaliated with a series of connecting punches to Szeto's guts and finished him with a KO by doing a high kick to Szeto's face. The fight ends with Szeto lying on the ground with Chan claiming to him that "There's only one Ho-Nam in Causeway Bay and that's me, Chan Ho-Nam".  The film ends with Mei Ling celebrating the win with Chan and the crew with Ben-Hon and Key earning millions from the bets and all of Tong Sing's men being arrested.

Jerry and Terri have dinner with Mary (Brenneman), a writer friend of Terri's, and Mary's husband Barry (Eckhart) a business executive who is oblivious to his wife's unhappiness. During dinner, Mary talks about writing for a local newspaper column about bickering couples and their troubles, while Barry does not think that other couple problems are anyone else's concern. After dinner, Jerry discreetly asks Mary out on a date. Mary, out of frustration, accepts.  The next day, Terri, visiting a local art gallery, meets and begins a secret romance with Cheri (Kinski), a lesbian art gallery worker. Terri feels satisfied with their lovemaking and enjoys the quiet of it compared with Jerry's performance.  Meanwhile, Cary (Patric), a doctor friend of Barry's, is a devious and narcissistic sexual predator who picks up and seduces naïve and emotionally vulnerable young women, and quickly dumps them for his cruel pleasure of watching them cry. Aware of the distance between Barry and Mary, Cary tries to persuade Barry to leave his wife for the swinging, non-monogamous lifestyle that Cary has built for himself. Barry thinks that his marriage can be saved.  During Jerry and Mary's rendezvous at a local hotel, Jerry fails to get aroused during foreplay. As a result, he takes out his frustrations on Mary, believing that she has made him impotent. Angry and offended by Jerry's misogynist outburst, Mary abruptly ends their "affair." She feels more miserable a few days later when Barry unwittingly takes her to the very same hotel room to rekindle their romance. Mary realizes that Jerry had told Barry about being in the room. Barry fails to understand Mary's unhappy attitude and thinks he might somehow be responsible for it.  Jerry, Barry, and Cary get together to work out at the local gym and, in the steam room, Barry tries to get them to reveal their best sexual experiences. Barry tells them that he only feels satisfied with himself. Cary then tells a disturbing story about his best sexual experience: partaking in a gang rape where he and a group of friends forcibly sodomized a male high school classmate on the floor in the locker room at his boarding school when he was a teenager. Both Barry and Jerry are stunned but fascinated by Cary's sordid and evil story. When Barry tries to persuade Jerry to reveal his best sexual experience, Jerry refuses. After being goaded in the locker room, Jerry angrily responds that his best sexual experience was with Barry's wife. He then leaves, with Barry too stunned to respond. Cary, also caught off-guard, says: "that beats my story."  After returning home from the gym, Barry confronts Mary over dinner about her affair with Jerry just as Terri accidentally finds out about Jerry's indiscretion and eventually confronts him too while they are shopping at a local bookstore. Mary and Jerry are both unapologetic for their unfaithfulness and express dissatisfaction to both of their spouses. Terri accidentally reveals her own lesbian romance with Cheri, but does not display any guilt for her infidelity. Jerry soon confronts Cheri at the art gallery over his wife's affair with her. Cheri also shows no remorse or regret for her relationship with Terri, or with interfering with Jerry and Terri's troubled marriage. Cheri tells Jerry that Terri can do much better than being with him.  As the film comes to an end, both of the married couples split up. Terri moves in with Cheri, although she quickly finds her emotional neediness irritating. Jerry continues his philandering lifestyle with his female theater students. Barry becomes miserable all by himself because he is no longer able to give himself an erection during masturbation. Mary is revealed to have moved in with Cary, who treats her as coldly as all the other women in his life even though she is pregnant with his child. The film closes on Mary and Cary in bed, as Mary realizes that she is even more unhappy in her new relationship with the catty and heartless Cary than she had been with her clueless husband Barry.
