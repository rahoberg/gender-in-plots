8 Man
  Murdered by criminals, Detective Yokoda's body is retrieved by Professor Tani and taken to his laboratory.  There, Tani performs an experiment that has failed seven times; Yokoda is the eighth subject to have his life force transferred into an [[Android (robot)|android]] body.  For the first time, the experiment succeeds.  Yokoda is reborn as the [[armor]]-skinned android 8 Man, able to dash at impossible speeds, as well as [[shape-shift]] into other people. He shifts himself into Yokoda, this time [[infant baptism|christening]] himself as "Hachiro Azuma".  He keeps this identity a secret, known only to Tani and his police boss Chief Tanaka.  Even his girlfriend Sachiko and friend Ichiro do not know he is an android.  As 8-Man, Hachiro fights crime (even bringing his own murderers to justice). To rejuvenate his powers, he smokes "energy" cigarettes that he carries in a cigarette case on his belt.<ref></ref>  In Japan, the character's origin actually varies significantly between the original manga, the TV series, and the live-action movie.  In the original Japanese manga and TV series, the character's name does not change when he is reborn as 8 Man.  The "Detective Yokoda" name was created for the live-action version.  In the manga, Detective Azuma is trapped in a warehouse and gunned down, while the TV series has him killed when he is run over by a car.  Also, in the Japanese story, the character is called "8 Man" because he is considered an extra member of the Japanese police force.  There are seven regular police precincts and 8 Man is treated as an unofficial eighth precinct all to himself.  The Japanese manga was presented as serial novella stories along with a set of one-shot stories.  Many of the stories were edited down and adapted for the TV series, but not all of them.  The novella stories were originally printed on a weekly basis in ''Shukuu Shōnen Magazine'' in 16-page increments that consisted of 15 story pages and one title page.  Ten additional one-shot stories were presented in seasonal and holiday specials of ''Shuukuu Shōnen Magazine''.  These stories were generally between 30-40 pages in length.  In the North American version of the series the resurrected detective/android is known as "Tobor" or the word "robot" spelled backwards. Tani is referred to as "Professor Genius" and the sobriquet of 8-Man is changed slightly to "8th-Man". The story content was clearly directed toward a wider audience of both young and adult viewers.  Due to changes in cigarette advertising laws in the 1960s, television characters were not allowed to be seen smoking.  As this was a major plot device in the series, the show was forced to be removed from broadcast in the United States.  
3 Ninjas (film)
  Every year, 12-year old Samuel, 10-year old Jeffrey and 8-year old Michael Douglas visit their Japanese grandfather, Mori Tanaka at his cabin. Mori trains his grandchildren in the art of [[Ninjutsu]]. As the summer comes to an end, Mori gives each of them a new "ninja" name based on their personalities: 'Rocky', 'Colt', and 'Tum-Tum'.   Meanwhile, the boys' father, Sam Douglas, is an [[FBI]] agent who stages a [[sting operation]] to entrap Hugo Snyder in the sale of warheads. Snyder escapes the trap with the use of his own ninja henchmen. Snyder decides to test Mori's fighting skill. The boys ignore Mori's orders to stay in the house and aid by defeating two ninjas on their own. Snyder threatens Mori's family if he doesn't get Douglas off his back, and Mori chides the boys briefly for interfering in his personal affairs. When they return home, they find their father unenthusiastic to see what they had learned during their visit and more annoyed at their new names. Emily, a friend of Rocky's, compliments his new name and agrees to ride with them to school the next day. Snyder develops a plan to kidnap the boys to use them as leverage to get Douglas to back off. Since the FBI watches them, his assistant Brown contacts his nephew Fester and his buddies Hammer and Marcus, in the midst of a convenience store robbery, to kidnap the boys. Due to Douglas and his FBI crew's presence, they are unable to capture the boys.   The next day, Fester and his friends attempt to follow the boys to school but are side-tracked by a fender bender with a police car. Emily becomes separated from the boys and encounters a group of bullies who steal her bike. Emily becomes upset with Rocky for showing off and walks to school alone. At recess, the boys challenge the bullies to a two-on-two basketball game to ten, and they spot the bullies nine points. The brothers effortlessly score ten consecutive points, winning Emily's bike and respect back. That night, Colt learns that Snyder, who they assumed was a friend of Mori's, is actually the criminal their father is after, and they begin to suspect Mori is involved in crime. They are left with a babysitter when Jessica leaves to pick up Sam, and Fester and his friends break into the house with a fake pizza order, subduing the babysitter. A series of intricate household traps keep the bumbling would-be kidnappers off of them and they use a device in Rocky's bedroom to call Emily over and use her as a hostage. Due to an earlier trap, Hammer and Marcus run to the bathrooms sick to their stomachs, and the boys (and mainly Emily) defeat Fester. Hammer and Marcus are subsequently defeated. After freeing the babysitter, the boys are overpowered by Brown and Snyder's bodyguard Rushmore.   Mori offers to sneak in alone to find the boys so as not to raise the alarm to Snyder. The boys escape their captivity and after a series of fights through the ship, they come across Rushmore. Using a lesson they got on their last day and inspired by their grandfather who came to rescue them, they manage to subdue Rushmore and are reunited with Mori. Snyder confronts Mori and challenges him to a fight for the boys' freedom. Due to his youth and speed, Snyder almost proves too much for Mori, until he remembers a handful of Tum-Tum's jelly beans which Tum-Tum had given him for luck and uses them to gag Snyder. Refusing defeat, Snyder grabs a gun from one of his subordinates but is suddenly shot and subdued by Douglas who had arrived just in time. Snyder and his men are arrested. Sam later apologizes to Mori for underestimating him and gives him a hug before being advised from a pained Mori that a bow would work just fine. Sam then tells his partner Jerry to complete the paperwork of the night's events on his own as he has a whole family of heroes to take out for pizza, which Mori detests, as he hates pizza.  ===''International version''=== The international cut of the film features a number of small parts of scenes that were cut from the movie for its American release, most likely to ensure a PG rating. Among the cut scenes are [not all-inclusive]: Extra footage of Snyder's escape in which he confronts two FBI agents whom he promptly defeats, a scene in which the robbers fire a gun in the convenience store and tie up the clerk behind the counter, a scene in which the robbers get the Douglas family address from Brown, additional footage of Grandpa trailing Snyder to his ship hideout, numerous small portions of the scene where the robbers invade the Douglas household, including Colt beating the robbers after getting them under a tarp in the room being renovated and a scene of Fester, the leader of the robbers asking his uncle (Brown) if he can be paid, extra sarcastic dialogue while the boys are locked up in Snyder's ship, an extended scene in which the boys are reunited with Grandpa, footage of Brown knocking himself unconscious on a pipe and subsequently complaining about his pain when being taken away by the Feds. Additionally, in the international version the boys lose the basketball challenge and their bikes, so a scene ends the international version of the film in which they fight the bullies to get them back.  
1492: Conquest of Paradise
 In the beginning, Columbus is obsessed with making a trip westwards to Asia, but lacks crew and a ship. The Catholic theologians at the [[University of Salamanca]] heavily disapprove of it, and they are not keen on ideas that go against the writings of [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaeus]]. After continuous warnings at the monastery, he becomes involved in a brawl with the monks, ending up lying in the monastery courtyard to pay penance. His eldest son, Diego, one of the monks, looks on disapprovingly. As Columbus continues his penance through a vow of silence, he is approached by [[Martín Alonso Pinzón|Martín Pinzon]], a shipowner from [[Palos de la Frontera|Palos]], who introduces Columbus to the banker [[Luis de Santángel|Santángel]]. [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella I]] ([[Sigourney Weaver]]) owes money to Santángel. Columbus meets with the queen, who grants him his journey in exchange for his promise to bring back sufficient amounts of riches in gold.  Columbus tricks many crewmen by telling them that the voyage would only last seven weeks. He goes to confession at the monastery to absolve his sins, and the monk reluctantly gives him absolution, as he is unable to inform the crewmen without breaking his oath. The next morning, three ships leave for the trip to Asia, with the flagship being the ''[[Santa Maria (ship)|Santa Maria]]''. During the voyage at night, Captain Méndez notices him navigating by the stars, a skill previously known only to the [[Moors]]. Columbus then happily teaches how to use the [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] to find the [[North Star]] and that the [[28th parallel north|28th parallel]] must be followed to find land. Nine weeks go by and still no sign of land. The crew becomes restless and the other captain turns against Columbus. He tries to reinvigorate them, to let them see the dream that he wishes to share. While some of the crewmen were still not convinced, the main sail suddenly catches the wind, which the crewmen see as a small act of God's willingness. At night, Columbus notices mosquitoes on the deck, indicating that land is not far off. Some days later, Columbus and the crew spot an [[albatross]] flying around the ship, before disappearing. Suddenly, out of the mist they see [[Guanahani]] ("San Salvador") with lush vegetation and sandy beaches, their first glimpse of the [[New World]].  They befriend the local natives, who show them gold they have collected. Columbus teaches one of them Spanish so that they are able to communicate. He then informs them that they are to return to Spain momentarily to visit the Queen and bring the word of God. They leave behind a group of crewmen to begin the colonisation of the New World. Columbus receives a high Spanish honour from the Queen and has dinner with the Council. They express disappointment with the small amount of gold he brought back, but the Queen approves of his gifts. On the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Second voyage|2nd expedition]], Columbus takes 17 ships and 1,500 men with him to the island; however, all the crewmen left behind are found to have been killed. When the tribe is confronted by Columbus and his troops, they tell him that other strangers came and savaged them. Columbus chooses to believe them, but his commanding officer [[Adrián de Moxica|Moxica]] is not convinced. They begin to build the city of [[La Isabela]] and eventually manage to hoist the town bell into its tower, symbolising the arrival of Christianity in the New World.  Four years later, Moxica cuts the hand off one of the natives, accusing him of lying about the whereabouts of gold. The word of this act of violence spreads throughout the native tribes and they all disappear into the forest. Columbus begins to worry about a potential war arising, with the natives heavily outnumbering them. Upon return to his home, he finds his house ablaze by Moxica and his followers, confirming his unpopularity among a certain faction of the settlers. Soon, the tribes arrive to fight the Spaniards and the island becomes war-torn, with Columbus' governorship being reassigned with orders for him to return to Spain.  Christopher Columbus is accused of nepotism and offering administrative positions to his personal friends, thereby injuring the pride of the nobles such as Moxica; so, he is replaced by [[Francisco de Bobadilla|de Bobadilla]]. It is revealed that [[Amerigo Vespucci]] has already travelled to the mainland America. Therefore, Columbus returns to Castile. Columbus is sentenced to many years in prison, but he is bailed out by his sons soon after. When summoned by the Queen about seeing the New World again, he makes a case for her about his dream to see the New World. She agrees to let him take a final voyage, with the proviso that he does not go with his brothers nor returns to [[Santo Domingo]] or the other colonies. Columbus and his son go to Panama.The closing scene shows him old, with his youngest son writing down his tales of the New World.

Aladdin tricks the Genie into freeing themselves from the cave without using a wish, and he uses his first to become "Prince Ali Ababwa" in order to woo Jasmine.  At Iago's suggestion, Jafar plots to become Sultan by marrying Jasmine. When Aladdin greets Jafar and the Sultan at the palace, Jasmine becomes upset at them. Refusing the Genie advising him to tell Jasmine the truth, Aladdin takes Jasmine on a flight on the magic carpet.

However, they escape, and return to the palace, where Jafar tries to use his final wish to make Jasmine fall in love with him, but the Genie can't grant the wish as it's against the three genie rules (other than killing people and raising people from the dead). Upon noticing Aladdin, Jasmine pretends to be interested to distract Jafar, and Aladdin tries to retrieve the lamp. Jafar catches on to the plan however, stops Aladdin, traps Jasmine inside an [[hourglass]], and overpowers Aladdin and his friends with his magic, but Aladdin tricks him into using his last wish to become an all-powerful genie. According to the rules of the genie, however, Jafar is now bound to his new lamp, and he and Iago end up trapped inside it.  With the palace and kingdom returned to normal, the Genie sends Jafar's lamp far away into the Cave of Wonders, and suggests Aladdin to use his third wish to regain his royal title, so the law will allow him to stay with Jasmine. Realizing that he has to be himself, Aladdin decides to keep his promise and frees the Genie. Realizing Aladdin and Jasmine's love, the Sultan changes the law to allow Jasmine to marry whom she chooses. The Genie leaves to explore the world, while Aladdin and Jasmine plan their marriage.

Alien 3
  In 2179 a fire starts aboard the Colonial Marine spaceship ''[[Sulaco (fictional spacecraft)|Sulaco]]''. The computer launches an escape pod containing [[Ellen Ripley]], the young girl Newt, Hicks, and the damaged [[Android (robot)|android]] Bishop; all four are in [[Cryonics|cryonic]] [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]]. Scans of the crew's [[Cryonics|cryotubes]] show a [[Facehugger|queen facehugger]] attached to one member. The pod crash-lands on Fiorina "Fury" 161, a [[foundry]] facility and [[penal colony]] inhabited by male inmates with [[XYY syndrome|double-Y chromosome syndrome]], a genetic mutation which gives the afflicted individual a predisposition for brutal antisocial behavior such as rape and murder. The inmates recover the crashed pod and its passengers. The same facehugger is seen approaching inmate Murphy's dog, Spike.   Ripley is awakened by Clemens, the prison doctor, who informs her that she is the sole survivor. She is warned by the prison warden, Harold Andrews, that her presence may have disruptive effects. Ripley insists that Clemens perform an [[autopsy]] on Newt, secretly fearing that Newt may be carrying an alien embryo. Despite protests from the warden and his assistant Aaron, the autopsy is conducted and no embryo is found. The bodies of Newt and Hicks are cremated.  Elsewhere in the prison, a quadrupedal alien bursts from Spike. Growing to full size, the alien kills Murphy, Boggs, and Rains and returns outcast prisoner Golic to his previously psychopathic state — Golic dubs the alien "Dragon". Ripley finds the damaged Bishop in the prison's garbage dump. Just as she is leaving the area, she is cornered by four inmates and attacked, but inmate leader Dillon intervenes and beats the others with a crowbar and Ripley punches the last man in the face. Ripley returns to the infirmary and re-activates Bishop, who confirms that a facehugger came with them to Fiorina in the escape pod. Ripley informs Andrews of [[Aliens (film)|her previous encounter with the xenomorphs]]<ref>The alien species is defined as "xenomorph" within the previous film ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', and is later referred to as "xenomorph by Ripley when she is sending an email to Weyland-Yutani.</ref> and suggests everyone work together to hunt down and kill it. The highly skeptical Andrews does not believe her story, and explains that even if he were hearing the truth, the facility is without weapons; their only hope is the rescue ship being sent for Ripley by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.  The alien ambushes Ripley and Clemens in the prison [[First aid room|infirmary]], killing him and threatening Ripley, but then mysteriously spares her and retreats. Ripley then rushes to the cafeteria to warn the others. Andrews orders Aaron to take her back to the infirmary, but the warden himself is dragged into the vents and killed by the alien. Ripley rallies the inmates and proposes they pour flammable toxic waste into the ventilation system and ignite it to flush out the extraterrestrial. However, its intervention causes a premature explosion and several inmates are killed. With Aaron's help, Ripley scans herself using the escape pod's medical equipment and discovers the embryo of a [[Alien Queen|xenomorph queen]] growing inside her. She also discovers that Weyland-Yutani hopes to turn the aliens into [[biological warfare|biological weapons]].  Deducing that the alien will not kill her because of the embryo she carries, Ripley begs Dillon to kill her; he agrees only if she helps the inmates kill the alien first. They form a plan to lure the alien into the foundry's molding facility, trap it via a series of closing doors, and drown it in molten lead. The bait-and-chase plan results in the deaths of all the remaining prisoners except Dillon and Morse. Dillon remains in the mold as he allows himself to be killed by the alien as Morse pours the molten lead onto them. Although the alien is covered in molten metal, it escapes the mold but Ripley activates the fire sprinklers, causing its molten metal exoskeleton to cool rapidly and shatter, killing it.  The Weyland–Yutani commando team arrives, including a man who looks identical to Bishop,<ref>Identified as '''Michael Bishop Weyland''' in tie-in materials.</ref> who explains that he is Bishop's creator. He tries to persuade Ripley to undergo surgery to remove the queen embryo, which he falsely claims will be destroyed, but which in reality would be used as a biological weapon. Ripley refuses and steps back onto a mobile platform, which Morse positions over the furnace. The Weyland–Yutani team shoot Morse in the leg in a late effort to stop him; Aaron strikes the Bishop look-a-like with a wrench and flees. The scientists then shoot Aaron, killing him. Ignoring Bishop's pleas to give them the embryo, Ripley throws herself into the furnace as the infant queen erupts from her chest. Ripley grabs it to prevent it from escaping as they both fall into the furnace. The facility is closed and Morse, the sole survivor, is led away as Ripley's recording from the first film plays for the final time in the EEV.  
All's Well, Ends Well
 ''All's Well, Ends Well'' is a comic romance of 3 hapless brothers, who eventually learn through their amorous exploits and misadventures that love is only won through gradual nurturing, and quickly lost through the quick, dishonest, selfish ways which they have always taken for granted.  Moon (Raymond Wong) is eldest brother and head of the family. The film begins with the celebration of his 7th anniversary wedding with Leng, which celebration he deserts, preferring instead the company of his mistress (Sheila Chan). He turns up at home with her later, forcing his wife (whom he calls 'hag') to leave the house in dismay. Although she is very devoted to her husband and tolerates him for all his misbehaviors, her tolerance stops short of accepting his mistress openly in the family home.  So (Leslie Cheung) is an effeminate floral arranger and lecturer at an art school, who is good at cooking and enjoys women's hobbies. His second cousin Mo-seung comes to his house on that same evening, and entirely devours an elaborate gourmet banquet which So had intended as a gift for Leng on her otherwise disastrous wedding anniversary. From that day on, So and Mo-seung are constantly at loggerheads over trivial issues, insulting each other with vulgar metaphors during a [[mahjong]] game session, apparently irreconcilable.  Foon is a local radio DJ who flirts shamelessly while on air and is well-known among his legion of female fans for his impressive kissing technique. Holli-yuk (Maggie Cheung) calls him on air one day and arranges a date with him. She is an avid [[Hollywood]] movie lover who enjoys re-enacting particular love-scenes from movies. She is convinced that Foon shares her romantic outlook and they soon become lovers.  Foon, however, is a notorious playboy not eager to settle down.  Predictably, Holli-yuk catches him in an act of infidelity.  After a freak accident leaves Foon suffering from a mildly debilitating mental illness, Holli-yuk offers to become a nurse for him.  Taking advantage of her role as his nurturer, she gleefully devises methods to punish him for his callous behaviour.  The brothers' dilemmas are later resolved in similarly titled sequel films. Each story concludes on a cheeky and high-spirited note.

American Shaolin
 During a martial arts tournament, the American finalist Drew Carson (Reese Madigan) is humiliated by his opponent, ruthless and sadistic kickboxer Trevor Gottitall ([[Trent Bushey]]) who pantses him during the match. To add to the insult, Drew's teacher Master Kwan ([[Kim Chan]]) confesses that he is not—as he had claimed—a Shaolin monk, and therefore he had not passed on the actual knowledge of [[Shaolin kung fu]] to Drew. Determined to learn the actual art to prevent another such situation, Drew departs for [[China]] and arrives at the [[Shaolin Temple]]. At first, the monks do not let him enter, but with the help of a pretty tea shop waitress, Ashena (Alice Zhang Hung), and an old monk ([[Henry O]]) who gives him a decisive advise, he waits outside of the temple for a week, after which he manages to be admitted. The old monk also turns out to be the abbot of the temple, Master San De, and he and his stern taskmaster train Drew and a number of other young apprentices in the ways of the Shaolin.  At first Drew causes much trouble as his American teenage temperament clashes with the tranquility within the temple and with his fellow student, Gao ([[Daniel Dae Kim]]), but under the rigorous physical and mental training he both improves his fighting skills and learns the meaning of discipline, humility, and patience. He makes friends with Gao and also manages to pass the two final tests: the Test of Spirituality, and the Test of the Chamber. Accepted as a full-fledged member of the [[Shaolin Monastery]], he accompanies—along with Ashena—a delegation of his fellow students and the abbot to a martial arts tournament in [[Shanghai]].  At the tournament, Drew encounters Trevor once again. Trevor taunts Drew before proceeding with this match against Gao. Gao initially gains the upper hand, but Trevor resorts to his dirty fighting techniques and injures Gao. With Gao pinned against the ropes, Trevor demands a match against the "American Shaolin". Drew rises, but sits down again, refusing to fight Trevor on the principle of non-violence and selflessness. Infuriated, Trevor continues to beat up Gao and hurls him out of the ring. Encouraged by Master San De, Drew finally enters the ring to fight Trevor. Trevor immediately used dirty tricks again, but Drew prevails and even offers his hand to the defeated Trevor. The crowd voices their support for Shaolin, and Master San De declares that "this is the future of Shaolin".

Jacob's ex-girlfriend, art student Andrea Livingston ([[Shawn Weatherly]]) is watching Jacob's two teenage kids, naive Lisa ([[Megan Ward]]) and troubled Rusty ([[Damon Martin]]), while he's gone.  When Jacob returns, he informs them that Amityville wants his company to develop a new neighborhood with a timeless concept. Jacob has also brought home an old, mantle clock that he found in the remains of [[The Amityville Horror (film series)|an old house in Amityville]]. Jacob puts it on the fireplace mantle, stating that it's "what our house has been missing". Once it's on the mantle, however, things take a turn for the worse. It turns out the clock's ticking is incredibly loud, even so it can be heard upstairs. Unknown to the family, the clock attaches itself to the mantle, preventing it from being moved. But the strangest of all, Rusty goes downstairs in the middle of the night and turns on the living room [[light switch]]. Every time he flips the switch, the living room is replaced with an ancient-looking [[torture chamber]]. This happens until the [[lightbulb]] finally burns out.  The next morning, after Lisa and Rusty leave for school (though we later learn Rusty actually skipped school that day), Jacob decides to go jogging. As he reaches the end of the jog his [[digital watch]] mysteriously stops. He turns around to find his neighbor Mrs. Tetmann ([[Terrie Snell]]) and her dog, Peaches, standing there ominously. Mrs. Tetmann lets go of Peaches and Peaches attacks Jacob, viciously mauling Jacob's leg. Jacob manages to escape by slashing Peaches's face with a broken bottle. At the hospital, the doctor ([[Willie C. Carpenter]]) mistakes Andrea for Jacob's wife. He tells her that Jacob's wound will have to be cleaned and rebandaged every few hours. Andrea agrees to stay with Jacob for a few more days until he's able to walk. At home, Jacob doesn't take care of his wounded leg and refuses to let Andrea clean it out.  Meanwhile, Rusty (skipping school) visits the neighbor, Iris Wheeler ([[Nita Talbot]]). He tells her about what he saw in the living room last night. She assumes that what Rusty saw was an evil force. It was afraid of Rusty and was trying to win him over. She says it would only go to their home because where it used to be is gone: "It must find a new home". When Rusty gets home, Andrea and him go to Mrs. Tetmann's house to ask if Peaches was [[vaccination|vaccinated]]. Mrs. Tetmann doesn't know what they're talking about and says that she and Peaches never even left the house that day. She even shows them Peaches face and there's no trace of a cut. Rusty spends a lot of time thinking about what Iris said.  Jacob, rather than resting, is busy designing a model for a new neighborhood. At dinner, Andrea asks Rusty to go get the phone book from the living room, which usually only takes a minute or two. However, when Rusty (who was talking the whole time) gets back into the living room, three hours have passed. Lisa lets Andrea have her room for the night and she sleeps on the couch in the living room. But the loud ticking from the clock keeps Lisa awake all night. Finally, near 3:00 am, she asks Andrea if she can sleep with her. Andrea says yes and tells Lisa to get her pillow from the living room. But when Lisa gets her pillow, the living room doors slam shut and lock. In Andrea's room, she hears the door open and something gets in bed with her. She finds the other side of the bed drenched in black slime. She turns the light on, but it's not there. Andrea goes downstairs and unlocks the living room doors, letting Lisa out. She suspects that Rusty may have locked them, but he tells her he went for a walk.  The next morning, Andrea learns that Peaches was killed the night before and a [[swastika]] has been drawn in blood on Mrs. Tetmann's house. The police suspect that Rusty may have had something to do with it. That night, Andrea's boyfriend Leonard visits and had a hallucination of Jacob shooting him with [[Walther P38|a gun]]. The next day, Rusty visits Iris' house and describes to her the things he had seen in his living room and telling her that it all began the night his father had returned home from Amityville. Iris later figures out that it is the clock that's causing everything to go wrong but on her way to warn Rusty she is killed by a duck statue that falls from the roof. Meanwhile, at the Sterling residence things start to go terribly wrong with Lisa's boyfriend Andy melting into the floor, Leonard encountering goo and a zombie that rises out of the bathtub, and Jacob acting aggressively. Both Lisa and Jacob are now under the clock's complete control, and Rusty is forced to kill Lisa in self-defense. Andrea manages to overcome Jacob's attack, but learns that the clock de-aged Rusty into a child as he tried to destroy it. Andrea orders the clock to let Rusty leave and she begins to smash open the wall. As she does, she sees giant clockgears inside the wall and is unable to destroy the clock. As it begins to age her into an old woman, she ignites an exposed gas pipe, causing an explosion.  The clock rewinds back to the first night Jacob brought the clock home. Andrea, however, has retained her memories of the events that took place and this time she smashes the clock when Jacob comes home with it. When Jacob asks her, "What the hell was that all about?!" she replies, "It's about time, that's what!" As Andrea departs, Rusty sees Iris standing across the street and the two exchange smiles, hinting that they have retained their memories of what occurred.

Army of Darkness
 After being transported to the Middle Ages, [[Ash Williams]] is captured by [[King Arthur|Lord Arthur]]'s men, who suspect him an agent for Duke Henry, with whom Arthur is at war. He is enslaved along with the captured Henry, his gun and chainsaw confiscated, and is taken to a castle. Ash is thrown in a pit where he kills a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthur's Wise Man. After demanding Henry and his men be set free, as he knew it was a [[Witch-hunt|witch hunt]], and killing a Deadite publicly, Ash is celebrated as a hero. He grows attracted to Sheila, the sister of one of Arthur's fallen knights.  According to the Wise Man, the only way Ash can return to his time is through the magical ''[[Necronomicon#In popular culture|Necronomicon Ex-Mortis]].'' Ash then starts his search for the ''Necronomicon''. As he enters a haunted forest, an unseen force pursues Ash into a windmill, crashing into a mirror.

When he arrives at the ''Necronomicon''s location, he finds three books instead of one and determines which is the actual book. Attempting to say the phrase that will allow him to remove the book safely "[[Klaatu barada nikto]]" he forgets and tries to unsuccessfully mumble and cough "nikto".

Article 99
 Pat Travis ([[Troy Evans (actor)|Troy Evans]]) is a Vietnam war veteran who needs a triple bypass heart surgery, and thus heads off to the government-funded Monument Heights Veterans' Hospital in Washington D.C.  However, as he gets there, he meets a hospital in complete chaos, riddled with lethargic, insidious bureaucracy and unable to accommodate new patients due to the government's 'creeping cutback' policy.  There, he meets wiseguy veterans Luther Jerome ([[Keith David]]), who introduces him to the hospital's hectic situation, and 'Shooter' Polaski ([[Leo Burmester]]), who shortly drives through the hospital's entrance and starts a shooting rampage with his M16 after being issued an Article 99 form - which states the hospital finds the patient eligible, but can't be treated immediately as the supposed ailment is not combat-related.  The hospital is managed by the by-the-book bureaucrat Executive Director, Dr. Henry Dreyfoos ([[John Mahoney]]), who is determined to uphold the government's policies by any means, to the point of directly cutting patient's acceptance rates by half and instituting rigorous dressing codes and supply upkeeping regulations.  He's backed up by Chief of Medicine Leo Krutz ([[Jeffrey Tambor]]) and Chief Nurse Amelia Sturdeyvant ([[Julie Bovasso]]), who follow and back-up Dreyfoos' policies, fearing for their jobs.  Dreyfoos greatest opposition comes from the hospital's ER team led by surgeon Dr. Richard Sturgess ([[Ray Liotta]]), who has no qualms in exposing Dreyfoos' politicking to the press when he has the opportunity (Mostly thanks to his friend Luther) and performing illegal midnight hospital supply thefts called 'midnight requisitions' to be able to properly perform surgeries.  Dreyfoos is aware of Sturgess' activities, but can't prosecute him as he can't gather evidence.  Sturgess' team is shortly joined by Dr. Peter Morgan ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]), who plans to work temporarily in the hospital before starting private practice.  He's eventually instructed by Sturgess and his colleagues Ruby Bobrick ([[John C. McGinley]]), Sid Handleman ([[Forest Whitaker]]) and Robin Van Dorn ([[Lea Thompson]]) and constantly monitored by Nurse White ([[Lynne Thigpen]]).  His 'potential' after failing to attend to Travis' heart attack and causing a ruptured artery has Sturgess trying to convince him to join the team and also fight Dreyfoos' administration, but Morgan refuses, fearful their wrongdoings will eventually influence his medicine career.  Meanwhile, Morgan also meets World War II veteran Sam Abrams ([[Eli Wallach]]), considered by the hospital a 'gomer', a person that can't be admitted even with critical condition and has constantly to be moved and kept from administration so he won't be dismissed until he can be cured.  Abrams' sharing of experiences with Morgan has the newcomer doctor slowly start caring for him and start disagreeing to several of the hospital's conditions, especially that he can't properly accommodate the veteran and has to use old diagnoses to repeat needless exams.  Morgan also starts a relationship with Robin while Sturgess does so with psychologist Diana Walton ([[Kathy Baker]]), equally a by-the-book character that slowly starts opening up to Sturgess shortly after Polaski's incident.  Morgan learns, through overhearing Dreyfoos' conversation through the phone, a new shipment of cardiac surgery tools is stored in the Pathology department and relays it to Sturgess, who performs a 'midnight requisition' to get them.  Unfortunately, this was an elaborate trap set by Dreyfoos, who films the theft and blackmails Sturgess into voluntary suspension and declaration of guilt when charges are brought up, in exchange for the tape and a written declaration sparing both Bobrick and Handleman.  Sturgess falls apart while Walton backs him up, committed on not giving up on him.  Shortly after, Abrams himself passes away and this affects Morgan heavily, feeling he failed him and starting to take charge.  Morgan eventually finds Dreyfoos' tape and, infuriated he was used as bait, declares open rebellion against Dreyfoos, getting himself suspended.  Morgan arranges for Sturgess to return to the hospital and both, along with Luther and the veterans, start planning a hostile takeover to properly attend the patients without the administration's interference.  The veterans successfully lock the security guards outside while Dreyfoos is away, and Luther, armed with Polaski's M16, keeps the guards away while the police, despite being pressured, can't remove the blocking veterans as the hospital is under federal jurisdiction, much to Dreyfoos' chagrin.  It doesn't take long before the press arrives and this catches attention of the FBI and the Inspector General ([[Noble Willingham]]), who hastily travels to assess the situation.  The Inspector General attempts negotiating with Luther, but he stands his ground as the veterans unfurl a massive banner in the hospital written 'No Surrender'.  The FBI prepares to break into the hospital and retake it by force, cutting off the power supply and issuing a final warning.  Sturgess, who starts Travis' triple bypass surgery after he's in critical condition, leaves Morgan in charge as he convinces Luther to lay down resistance and reopen the hospital, much to the Inspector General's shock.  He and Dreyfoos enter the building and attempt to interrupt Travis' surgery and have Morgan arrested, but Morgan stands his ground.  Dreyfoos tries insisting on the arrest, but the Inspector General, revealed to have been a Vietnam war veteran and acknowledging the situation the hospital is facing, spares Morgan and puts Dreyfoos under a congressional hearing, suspending him from the hospital management and terminating his bureaucratic career.  Morgan decides to become a permanent resident in Monument Heights as no prosecutions are made and Travis is saved.  Victory is sadly short-lived, as Dreyfoos' unnamed replacement decides to upkeep Dreyfoos' previous policies.  Morgan and Sturgess decide to join up and make their stand against the 'new' administration.

The Babe
 The story begins in 1902 in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], where a seven-year-old Babe Ruth, troubled and not-so disciplined, is sent to the St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a [[reformatory]] and [[orphanage]]. Ruth is sent by his father, George Herman Ruth Sr. ([[Bob Swan]]), who cannot handle raising the boy.  At the school, Ruth is schooled by Catholic missionaries and is made fun of by other children, because of his large size.  Brother Matthias Boutlier ([[James Cromwell]]), the Head of Discipline at St. Mary's, first introduces Ruth to the game of baseball.  During a session of batting practice, Ruth hits several towering home runs off of Matthias, who is pitching.  Brother Matthias and others are stunned by Ruth's amazing power to drive the ball.  The film then flashes forward to 1914.  A 19-year-old Ruth (Goodman) is on St. Mary's baseball team.  Ruth continues to excel as a powerful hitter and a great pitcher.  Ruth's amazing skills come to the attention of [[Jack Dunn (baseball)|Jack Dunn]] ([[J.C. Quinn]]). Since Ruth is underage, Dunn decides to adopt Ruth and sign him to a contract with the [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Orioles]].  In the middle of the [[1914 Major League Baseball season|1914 baseball season]], Ruth is sold to the [[1914 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]].  As a member of the Red Sox, Ruth begins to gain wide attention for his home runs and becomes popular in Boston. However, he angers Red Sox owner [[Harry Frazee]] during a party, and following the 1919 season, Ruth demands a raise, and a suite for road games, so Frazee sells him to the [[1920 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] to finance his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows, which had cost him money ($125,000, equal to $}} today, the same amount of money that Frazee got for selling Ruth to be exact).  Ruth becomes very popular in New York, as he helps the Yankees win the World Series in 1923. Also, in one game, he hits two home runs for a little boy named [[Johnny Sylvester]], whom he had recently visited in hospital. However, two years later, after divorcing his first wife, Helen Woodford ([[Trini Alvarado]]), who revealed that Ruth was incorrigible after his parents left him out, Ruth starts to go into a slump, while teammate [[Lou Gehrig]] (Michael McGrady) becomes known as the "Iron Horse". After getting pelted with lemons during a game, he gets angry and storms onto the dugout, yelling at the crowd, who continue to pound him with lemons. He also takes a second wife Claire ([[Kelly McGillis]]), but that becomes complicated too.   However, in 1927, Ruth returns to his old self and hits 60 home runs, breaking his old record of 59 home runs. In 1932, during the [[1932 World Series|World Series]] against the [[1932 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]], in Game 3, Ruth, during an at-bat, points to center field and hits a towering home run, [[Babe Ruth's called shot|"calling his shot"]].  By 1934, Babe is well on the decline.  He wants to pursue his post-career ambition of managing a baseball team, but Yankees owner [[Jacob Ruppert|Colonel Jacob Ruppert]] has other intentions, releasing the Babe instead.  Under the promise of becoming a manager, Babe signs with the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]], but his presence on the team is more comedic than anything else.  Before a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Babe overhears the Boston owners saying he's only good for drawing a gate.  He responds by blasting three home runs in the game—then dramatically shuns the owner's proffered handshake of congratulations and drops his Braves cap on the ground, indicating that he is quitting the team.  The film ends with Ruth broken, trudging alone through the entrance tunnel. He is confronted by a man; it is Johnny ([[Stephen Caffrey]]), now grown up. The Babe is still his hero, as they part he calls after him "You're the best... you're the best there's ever been".

Batman Returns
 In the prologue, socialites Tucker and Esther Cobblepot give birth to a deformed baby boy, Oswald. Disgusted by his appearance and wild demeanor, they confine the baby to a cage and ultimately throw him into the sewer, where he is discovered by a family of penguins at Gotham Zoo.  Thirty-three years later, millionaire Max Shreck proposes to build a power plant to supply Gotham City with energy, though he is opposed by the city mayor. During Shreck's speech, Gotham is attacked by a disgraced former circus troupe, the Red Triangle Gang. Despite the efforts of Batman to stop the violence, Shreck is abducted and taken to the sewer, where he meets Oswald Cobblepot, the gang's secret leader now known as the Penguin. The Penguin blackmails Shreck with evidence of his corporate crimes into helping him return to the surface, and he accepts. Meanwhile, Shreck's secretary, Selina Kyle, discovers the true purpose of Shreck's power plant to drain Gotham of its energy and bring the city under Shreck's control. Shreck pushes her out of a window to silence her, but she survives the fall and vows revenge, taking up the mantle of Catwoman.  The Penguin makes his presence known by "rescuing" the Mayor's baby from a staged kidnapping attempt, and requests to be allowed into the Hall of Records to find his parents. Batman's alter-ego, Bruce Wayne, voices his suspicions about the Penguin's true motives, and investigates his background and connection to the Red Triangle Gang. During a meeting with Shreck, Wayne meets Kyle and the two become attracted to one another. In order to remove his enemies, Shreck pushes for the Penguin to run for mayor and discredit the current mayor by having the Red Triangle Gang wreak havoc on the city. Batman intervenes and meets Catwoman as she attempts to sabotage one of Shreck's businesses; she escapes, but is injured and swears revenge on Batman by allying with the Penguin to frame him for an undiscussed crime.  As Wayne and Kyle begin a romantic relationship, the Penguin abducts Gotham's Ice Princess and kills her, framing Batman for the act, at the same time sabotaging his Batmobile to rampage throughout Gotham (until Batman disconnects the controlling device), and ends his partnership with Catwoman, who didn't anticipate the murder, when she rejects his advances; he attempts to kill her with one of his flying umbrellas, but she survives after falling into a greenhouse. During the chase, Batman records the Penguin's disparaging remarks about the people of Gotham and later plays them during his next speech, destroying his image and forcing him to retreat to the sewer, where he reveals his plan to abduct and kill all of Gotham's firstborn sons as revenge for what his parents did to him. At a charity ball hosted by Shreck, Wayne and Kyle meet and discover each other's secret identities. The Penguin appears and reveals his plan, intending to take Shreck's son, Chip, with him, but Shreck gives himself up in his son's stead.  Batman foils the kidnappings and heads for the Penguin's lair. The Penguin attempts to have his army of penguins bomb the city and kill everyone in Gotham, though Batman and his butler, Alfred, jam the signal and order the penguins to head back to the sewer. Batman arrives and confronts the Penguin. In the ensuing fight, the Penguin falls through a window into the sewer's toxic water. Shreck escapes but is confronted by Catwoman, who intends to kill him. Batman pleads for Kyle to stop, unmasking himself in the process. Shreck draws a gun and shoots Wayne, and then shoots Kyle multiple times, but she survives and electrocutes herself and Shreck with a stun gun. Wayne, who was wearing body armour, finds Shreck's remains but Kyle is nowhere to be found. The Penguin emerges from the water, but eventually dies from his injuries and from the toxic sewage, and his penguin family lay his body to rest in the water. In the aftermath, as Alfred drives him home, Wayne sees Kyle's silhouette in an alley but only finds her cat, who he decides to take home with him. The Bat-Signal appears in the sky as Catwoman, who survived, watches.

Nick discovers that Catherine is basing the protagonist of her latest book on him, wherein his character is murdered after falling for the wrong woman. Catherine has bribed Lt. Nielsen for information from Nick's psychiatric file; Beth gives it to Nielsen after he recommends Nick's termination. After Nick assaults Nielsen, he becomes a [[prime suspect]] when Nielsen is killed. Nick suspects Catherine, and when he joins in her behavior in front of his co-workers, he is put on leave.  Nick and Catherine begin a torrid affair with the air of a [[cat-and-mouse game]]. Nick arrives at a club and witnesses Catherine doing coke with Roxy and another man. Nick and Catherine dance, make out, and are later observed having sex by Roxy. Catherine ties Nick to her bed with a white silk scarf the same way the blonde woman did with Boz, but does not kill him. Roxy, jealous of Nick, attempts to run him over with Catherine's car, but dies when the car crashes. Catherine grieves Roxy's death and tells Nick about a previous [[lesbian]] encounter at college that went awry. The girl became obsessed with her, causing Nick to believe that Catherine may not have killed Boz. Nick identifies the girl as Beth, who acknowledges the encounter, but claims it was Catherine who became obsessed.  Nick discovers the final pages of Catherine's book in which the fictional detective finds his partner's body. Catherine breaks off their affair; Nick becomes upset and suspicious. Nick later meets his partner Gus, who has arranged to meet with Catherine's college roommate at an office building to find out what really went on between Catherine and Beth. As Nick waits in the car, Gus is stabbed to death with an ice pick. Nick runs into the building, only to find Gus' body in a manner similar to the scene described in the book. Beth, standing in the hallway, explains that she received a message to meet Gus. Nick suspects she murdered Gus and, believing she is reaching for a gun, shoots her, only to find that Beth was only fingering an ornament on her key chain.  A search of the scene and Beth's apartment turns up the evidence needed to identify her as the killer. Despite knowing Catherine's apparent foreknowledge of Gus' death, that she must actually have been the killer, and that she must have set up Beth, Nick tells no one. He returns to his apartment where Catherine meets him. She explains her reluctance to commit to him and the two have sex. As they discuss their future, an ice pick is revealed to be under the bed.

With Hal incapacitated Belial is drugged to calm him down and the birth of his and Eve's twelve children is overseen by Little Hal, Hal and Granny Ruth's multi-armed and blob-like prodigy son. Shortly after Eve and Belial's children are born, Deputies Bailey and Baxter break into the Rockwell house, having realized there is a million dollar reward for the capture of both Duane and Belial. While the freaks party Bailey and Baxter find the sleeping babies and, mistaking the groggy Eve for Belial, shoot and kill her before fleeing with the babies when the freaks come after them.  At the police station, Sheriff Griffin finds his daughter in the midst of trying to rape Duane in [[dominatrix]] attire and sends her away, shortly before Bailey and Baxter arrive with the babies. Employing a nice bit of alliteration for which all the deputies names were clearly created: "Bailey, you book the Bradley boy, Baxter take the bassinet of baby Belials in back and get Brody to come by... Where's Brennan and Banner?... Bowling", Sheriff Griffin sends the obviously shaken Bailey and Baxter back to their homes and goes off to see what is going on at the Rockwell residence, leaving Officers Brennan, Banner, and Brody in charge of the station. Breaking into the Rockwell house Sheriff Griffin finds Granny Ruth and the freaks in the midst of mourning the dead Eve and the sheriff, disturbed by the sight of the freaks and Little Hal, hurries back to the station, which Belial had broken into. As Belial attacks Brennan, Banner and Brody, Opal releases Duane from his cell, hoping he can stop Belial. Belial kills Brennan by crushing his throat (causing his eyes and teeth to pop out) and rips Banner's head off before trying to maul Brody, who accidentally blasts Opal (who crushes one of the babies in her death throes) with his shotgun prior to having his neck snapped by Belial. Putting Belial in his basket, Duane runs from the station just as Sheriff Griffin appears and opens fire, injuring Belial. Wanting to help Belial reclaim his babies and take revenge on the remaining police Duane makes up with Belial and has Little Hal construct a robotic exoskeleton for him, which Belial utilizes to butcher Bailey and Baxter.  At Eve's funeral Granny Ruth rallies the grieving freaks and they all travel to the police station, where Sheriff Griffin, grieving over his dead daughter, offers them a deal: Belial for the babies. Granny Ruth agrees to the sheriff's offer and tells him to show up at an abandoned factory on the outskirts of town for the trade; after the meeting at the station Granny Ruth and the freaks ransack a fast food restaurant, scaring away all the customers, much to the chagrin of the staff.  Arriving at the factory with the babies and a shotgun for protection, Sheriff Griffin is ambushed by Belial and the two of them fight; Belial has the upper hand due to his exoskeleton. After seemingly killing Sheriff Griffin with a blow to the head from his mechanical claw, Belial goes to retrieve his children, but the recovered sheriff ambushes and trips him. Flailing about in his armor, Belial scores a hit against Sheriff Griffin, who is swarmed and killed by the babies when he falls into their cradle.  With the babies reclaimed Granny Ruth, Duane, Belial, and the freaks attack a talk show entitled Renaldo; Belial mauls the titular host. Speaking into the camera, Granny Ruth tells the world that the freaks will no longer hide in the shadows and will fight back if oppressed.  She finishes her speech by telling everyone to have a nice day.

Beethoven (film)
 A group of puppies are stolen from a pet store by two thieves. A [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] escapes and sneaks into the Newtons' home. The workaholic father, George Newton, doesn't want the responsibility of owning a dog, but his wife, Alice, and their children, Ryce, Ted and Emily, convince him. When Emily plays a portion of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]] on the piano, he barks along and they name him Beethoven.  Beethoven helps the children overcome their problems: he helps Ryce talk to her crush, scares off the bullies for Ted and saves Emily's life when she falls in the [[swimming pool]] of an irresponsible babysitter. George, jealous of the affection Beethoven receives, feels neglected as the family fawns over the dog. Beethoven's antics ruin a barbecue he is hosting for Brad and Brie, [[venture capital]]ists looking to invest in and secretly swindle him out of his [[air freshener|car freshener]] firm.  The family takes Beethoven to a [[Veterinary physician|veterinarian]], Dr. Herman Varnick, for a routine medical examination and [[immunization]]s. They are unaware that he is involved in [[medical ethics|unethical]] and deadly animal experimentation. He speaks to George and tells him of a supposed mental instability among St. Bernards making them potentially dangerous to humans and advises him to watch Beethoven closely for any sign of viciousness. He actually requires large-skulled dogs such as St. Bernards for an ammunition test.  Dr. Varnick visits the Newton home under the guise of doing a follow-up exam on Beethoven. He puts fake blood on his arm and hits Beethoven until he leaps on him. He tells George that Beethoven has to be [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]] or he will press charges. Emily, who saw Dr. Varnick hit him, protests that the attack was fake, but George, fearing for his family's safety, reluctantly takes him to Dr. Varnick's office. It is on the way there that George discovers his own affections for him: he remembers his father had to take their dog to the vet to be euthanized and he never forgave him for it. He fears that his own family will hate him now for taking Beethoven to be put down. When he returns home with the empty leash and collar, his family leaves the dinner table rather than remain with him.  After recognizing the children's sadness and having a conversation with Alice, the family goes to Dr. Varnick's office, but he claims that Beethoven has already been put down. George notices that Dr. Varnick has no bite marks on his arm and punches him. The family follows Dr. Varnick to his [[warehouse]]. Beethoven breaks free but is recaptured by Dr. Varnick's two associates, Harvey and Vernon, while Alice calls the [[police]]. George crashes through the [[skylight]] just as Dr. Varnick prepares to shoot Beethoven. Before he can, a captive [[Jack Russell Terrier]] bites him in the crotch, causing him to fire a shot in the air. During the fight, Ted drives the car into the building, launching numerous syringes into Varnick, sedating him. As the family frees all the captive dogs, they notice Harvey and Vernon trying to escape and send the dogs after them. They escape into a [[wrecking yard|junkyard]], only to be attacked by a pack of [[Doberman Pinscher|Doberman]]s guarding it.  Dr. Varnick, Harvey, and Vernon are arrested for [[Cruelty to animals|animal abuse]]. The family is praised as heroes by the news and George takes a new liking to Beethoven. Ryce also gets a phone call from her crush. The family then goes to sleep, saying good night to Beethoven and all of the dogs they rescued, who are all sleeping in the Newtons' bedroom.  
Bébé's Kids
 The film is based on a [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up routine]] by [[Robin Harris]] that is shown in a brief live-action segment at the beginning of the film. The story begins with an animated version of Harris woefully recounting his troubles to a blind bartender. He traces his problems all the way back to Jamika, an attractive woman he met at a [[funeral]].  Outside the premises, Robin approaches Jamika and asks her out. Jamika picks up her mild-mannered son, Leon, from the babysitter and invites Robin to come along with her to an [[amusement park]] named Fun World, to which Robin agrees. The next day, Jamika introduces Robin to Kahlil, LaShawn, and Pee-Wee, the neglected, truant, violent children of her absentee hedonistic friend, Bébé, for whom Jamika serves as an oblivious enabler. All six travel to Fun World, but are confronted by security before they can enter, and warned they are being watched. Upon entering the park, the kids are set loose and promptly wreak havoc. Robin's disastrous outing is further disrupted by a chance encounter with his ex-wife, Dorothea.  After going on a couple of rides with the kids, Robin and Jamika let the kids go off on their own again as they attempt to enjoy a ride through the Tunnel of Love, where Jamika commends Robin for his endurance. While Robin and Jamika spend time together on their own, Leon tries to fit in with Bébé's kids but is unsuccessful. The kids then resume their trouble until they are caught by security. However, they escape and convince a bunch of other kids to spread the chaos. Meanwhile, Dorothea and her friend Vivian attempt to sabotage the growing relationship between Robin and Jamika but are thwarted by Robin.  Elsewhere, in an abandoned building, Leon and Bébé's kids are captured by robot versions of the [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], and [[Richard Nixon]], and are put on trial. The robot "Terminator" acts as the judge who decides whether the kids are worth sending to the [[electric chair]], while "Lincoln" acts as the kids' defense attorney with "Nixon" as the [[Prosecution|prosecutor]]. The kids win their freedom through the power of rap, then celebrate their victory by stealing a pirate ship and crashing it into an ocean liner, tying up the crew and passengers.   Robin and Jamika finally leave Fun World with the kids who have destroyed the park. When a cop drives by, Robin tries to get his attention, but Bébé's kids glare at the cop threateningly and he flees, yelling, "Uh oh, those are Bébé's Kids!" (a line spoken by several other characters).   Robin drops the kids off at their apartment, where he sees how they really live. Bébé, as usual, is not home and has left a note on the empty refrigerator, expecting Jamika to feed the kids. Back at the bar, Robin has a change of heart and goes back to the apartment to hang out with the kids a little while longer. Later, the kids force him to take them all to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], where the kids are recognized, and everyone runs away screaming. Pee-Wee pulls a plug out of a socket, causing a [[Power outage|blackout]].

She insists on going there to meet him in person in order to know him better, to which they agree. Once in Canada, she meets with Vicky and initially approves of him. She then meets with Rohit ([[Kamal Sadanah]]) and slowly both fall in love with each other. When her parents find out, they are outraged, and so is Vicky.

Beethoven Lives Upstairs
 Ten-year-old Christoph's father, a physician, has died, forcing his family to rent their upstairs room to a boarder to help make ends meet. Christoph's uncle Kurt, a student at the [[University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna|Vienna Conservatory]], arranges for [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] to rent the room. Despite Beethoven's dismissive attitude toward him, Kurt is thrilled at the prospect of having the famous composer living at his late brother's house, but Christoph does not like the idea of a stranger living with them. Christoph's fears are confirmed when he encounters Beethoven's rude and eccentric behavior, and teasing from the neighborhood children.  When Sophie, their housekeeper, suggests that Beethoven is a heavy drinker, Christoph surreptitiously follows him on one of his walks.  Beethoven's mannerisms, including humming to himself (presumably composing as he walks) and dumping food on a waiter following an argument, convinces Christoph that Beethoven is a madman.  Christoph complains to Kurt, who talks about the pain of Beethoven's deafness and implores Christoph to give him a chance.  Kurt mentions that Beethoven is working on his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]], which Christoph hopes will be his last.  When Christoph's mother enters Beethoven's room, Beethoven is writing music on the shutters, presumably having run out of paper. Seeing her shock, he suggests she could sell the shutters as collectors items. He asks her about her musical background, and she plays "[[Für Elise]]" for him, beginning to see his softer side.  While working with musicians on the Ninth Symphony in his room, Beethoven needs to write down changes, but all the pens have been destroyed by his previous fits.  They frantically send Christoph out to buy some, but by the time he returns with the pens, the other musicians have left.  Beethoven then invites Christoph to join him on his walk. While on the walk, the two begin to open up to one another; it is at this time that Beethoven tells Christoph that his father, an alcoholic, abused him as a child and that he has very few happy memories of him.  When Sophie comes down from Beethoven's room, fuming after yet another quarrel, Christoph defends him.  After overhearing Beethoven talk about his misery from being deaf, Christoph gives him an [[ear trumpet]] designed by his father.  Kurt comes over to the house for another rehearsal with Beethoven, beaming that he has been selected to be part of the orchestra at the premiere of the Ninth Symphony. The singers complain about the difficulty of their parts, but Beethoven reassures them he would not have chosen them if he did not think they were capable. When he sees Christoph and his mother listening outside the door, he promises them tickets to the performance.  As the date of the concert nears, Beethoven becomes increasingly stressed and frustrated by setbacks. Christoph enters after Beethoven has had another quarrel with Sophie, and accidentally spills the sheet music for the concert. Beethoven then angrily orders him to leave the room. Christoph fears that Beethoven now hates him and would not give him the tickets, but Kurt reassures him that Beethoven's notorious tempers are short-lived and that someone able to write music as he does must have a great heart. Later, Beethoven apologizes to Sophie for his behavior and gives her the tickets to give to Christoph and his mother.  The concert is a great success; Beethoven is nominally [[conducting]], but is unable to hear the orchestra, and Kurt, acting as a second conductor, discreetly conducts from the side. When the orchestra finishes, Beethoven is behind and still "conducting", so Kurt and [[Caroline Unger|one of the sopranos]] turn him around so he can see the audience giving him a wild standing ovation.  Several years later, after [[Death of Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's death]], Christoph reflects on his experiences with Beethoven, saying that although Beethoven is gone, "his music will never die", and how Beethoven "thought he could change the world with his music – maybe he will... bit by bit."

Claire's teenage daughter Cassie, who is rebellious against her mother's old-fashioned behavior most of the time, names him Adam.  
Beta (film)
 ''Beta'' is the story of how greediness overtakes family values, portrayed by Aruna Irani as Laxmi and Madhuri Dixit as Saraswati in key roles, followed by Raju ([[Anil Kapoor]]), as the only child of a widower multi-millionaire father.  After the death of his wife, the widower (Raju's father) looks for a woman who can provide his son  a mother's love. Raju's father believes he can accomplish this for his son by marrying Laxmi ([[Aruna Irani]]), thinking that she will care for Raju as her natural son. Unfortunately, the step-mother is cruel and cunning. Even though Raju becomes devoted to his stepmother, with love and respect does whatever she asks of him - she cunningly convinces Raju that he should always remain naïve and uneducated. As Raju grows older, his stepmother increasingly isolates his aging father from the family, overpowering him and considering him  mentally incompetent,  locked up in a room of the family home.  Raju meets Saraswati ([[Madhuri Dixit]]) at a local fair, and after some dating they fall in love. Despite the villagers rumours that Saraswati is not chaste, Raju wishes to marry her. After the marriage, Saraswati lives in the extended family home as a good and happy wife, but later discovers that her stepmother-in-law's love for Raju is a ruse to discredit Raju's father and that Laxmi has the family fortune diverted to Raju's half-brother (greed for a family fortune). A battle of wits between the stepmother and the stepdaughter-in-law ensues.  Laxmi sees that her influence over the family is challenged by Saraswati, who insists that Raju's father leave behind his prison and return to the family circle as there is nothing wrong with him. Whenever Saraswati tries to draw the attention of Raju  of the intentions of his step-mother, Laxmi starts to abuse and embarrass Saraswati with all the family members present.  Not being able to bear embarrassment any longer, Saraswati is ready to leave, but then, to protect her husband  from Laxmi's  evil intentions, she decides to apologise to her mother-in-law. Saraswati then cleverly starts exposing Laxmi's every effort and intention in a dignified manner so that her husband will not be offended.  For example; The medical school degree of Raju's step-brother was bought rather than earned through studies. Saraswati also plans for Laxmi to slip and fall and get a fracture which will force her to remain bed ridden, and Raju would serve her like a good "son". In this way, Laxmi never has a moment to plan her cunning schemes.  A few years later, Saraswati becoming pregnant, which prompts Laxmi to attempt to kill Raju's unborn child (who will inherit the wealth) with poison in saffron and milk. Saraswati, being wary and cautious of her  mother in law's cruelty) discovers this scheme and informs her husband. Obviously, blinded by his mother, refuses to believe her accusations. Raju defends his step-mother and offers to prove that Saraswati is wrong  by drinking the milk and then coughs up blood.  At this point, near death, Raju realises that indeed what Saraswati said is true about his step-mother's evil intentions. In his usual innocent manner, he asks the culprit the reason why, and told her that all she had to do (as his mother) was simply "ask" for the wealth — he would have happily agreed to give her all of it. He tells Laxmi that his wish to die in peace would be accomplished if she, to at least once without malice, call him "her son". His words so deeply touch Laxmi that she realises her cruelty has gone too far.  The film concludes with Raju slowly recovering, agreeing to give to his "step mother" his worldly possessions, and leaving home with his wife and father and unborn child. At the last moment, Laxmi begs him not to leave and to prove her remorse she tears-up the legal papers and tells him that all she wants is nothing more than "her son".  
The Best Intentions
 In the early 20th century, Henrik Bergman is studying to be a parish minister under the [[Church of Sweden]]. A poor man, he meets the wealthy Anna Åkerblom through his friend, Anna's brother Ernst. Anna is vain and stubborn, and in Henrik's belief she is elitist, yet she is also attractive and capable of enjoying pleasure. Although Henrik lives in a sexual relationship with Frida, a waitress, Anna seduces him and proposes an engagement. As Henrik and Anna begin to see more of each other, Henrik secretly continues living with Frida. While speaking with Anna's mother Karin, Henrik confesses that he feels unwelcome among the Åkerbloms. Karin tells him frankly that she feels Anna needs a mature man who can nurture her, but he is lacking on both counts. Karin also tells Anna that Henrik is still living with Frida, a fact verified by the family. Henrik and Anna stop seeing each other until Frida appeals to Anna to take Henrik back, citing his misery.  While Anna is treated for [[tuberculosis]] in [[Switzerland]], a brother is sent to tell Henrik that she no longer wishes to speak to him. However, unknown to her parents, Anna sends a letter to Ernst to be forwarded to Henrik, telling him she wishes to resume their relationship. Her parents receive the letter and Anna's father Johan opens it, after which Karin reads it and burns it. After Johan dies, Karin confesses the act to Anna, who angrily seeks Henrik. By then, Henrik is planning to go to Forsboda, a remote village in northern Sweden, to work in a parish whose head minister is aged and ailing. Anna resolves to go with him, and they marry despite their class conflicts.  The Bergmans have their first son, [[Dag Bergman|Dag]], but Henrik becomes embroiled in the local [[strike action]], as he refuses to endorse poor working conditions and lends his church for a socialist meeting. This displeases Nordenson, who also dislikes Bergman's manner of instruction of Nordenson's daughters, as Nordenson refuses to kneel with his wife and girls. In the meantime, the Bergmans take in Petrus, a troubled orphaned boy. Later, Henrik and Anna are unexpectedly summoned to [[Stockholm]] to meet [[Victoria of Baden|Queen Victoria]], who chairs a board managing [[Sophiahemmet]] hospital and is seeking a chaplain, with the archbishop recommending Henrik. During the meeting, Victoria asks him if he believes suffering is sent by God. He replies suffering is useless and God views the world with horror, and leaves the palace fuming at having to flatter the Queen. The Bergmans decline the position, but the villagers are upset they did not hear of the offer except through rumours, and are disturbed by Henrik publicly humiliating Nordenson in church.  Upset, and expecting her second child, Anna insists on sending Petrus away, saying she did not agree to a permanent adoption and she dislikes the boy. Petrus overhears the conversation, and furious, kidnaps Dag and carries him to an icy river. The Bergmans see them and give chase, with Henrik saving Dag and slapping down Petrus, after which the boy leaves. In despair, Anna decides she can no longer live in Forsboda and takes Dag to the Åkerblom house, while Henrik at first resolves to stay in the village. He finally accepts the position in Stockholm and asks Anna to come with him, and she replies this is all she wants.  
Benny's Video
  The film opens with a home video of the slaughter with a [[captive bolt pistol]] of a pig on a European farm. The video rewinds to play the slaughter in slow motion, which emphasizes the hand-held barrel against the pig's fore-skull and the cartridge explosion. A party centered on a game called Pilot and Passengers is broken up by Georg and Anna, when they return home while the party is in progress. The host of the party, Eva, is their daughter who lives in another part of town and who has, we learn from the questioning of Benny after the incident, taken advantage of the planned absence of Georg and Anna to host the impromptu party in their home. While watching a newscast, Georg and Anna discuss the money Eva won in the [[pyramid scheme]] she was promoting at the party. In a locker room at school, Benny encourages his friends to take positions in his own Pilot and Passengers game.   While his parents are away for the weekend, Benny invites a girl ([[Ingrid Stassner]]) he has seen outside the local video store to his home. and then he unveils and loads the slaughtering gun. He holds it against his chest, and dares the girl to discharge it. When she refuses, he calls her a coward (''Feigling!''). He holds it against her chest, and when he hesitates, she calls him a ''Feigling'' also. He fires the gun, and she falls. Her falling reveals a video monitor, on which we see her crawling away from Benny and completely out of frame, Benny running to reload the gun and returning to shoot her a second time, the girl crawling back partially into frame, Benny again reloading and firing, this time apparently at her head, and, finally, her body remaining still.  During a choir practice of the [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] motet "Trotz dem alten Drachen,"<ref>http://www.answers.com/topic/jesu-meine-freude-motet-for-5-part-chorus-bwv-227-bc-c5 from "Jesu, meine Freude," BWV 227, J.S.Bach (between 1723-1735).</ref><ref>(de) [[:de:Jesu, meine Freude (Bach)|Jesu, meine Freude]]</ref> Benny completes his pyramid scheme. Then at home again, with the weekend begun, Benny first covers the body, goes through her school bag,  arranges an evening out with friends, eats snacks, moves the girl's body to a closet, and cleans up the blood. Some of the cleanup is seen through a video monitor, while Benny edits a video of the experience. Benny goes out to a dance club and stays overnight at his friend's home, and, on his way home, goes to a cinema, window shops, and gets his hair shorn to the scalp.  After his parents return, his father harangues Benny about his haircut, asking if Benny had any thought about how others would react to him now.  Later on, while the family is watching the news in Benny's room, Benny switches the signal to the video he has made, to the game of dares and the ensuing three shots. Benny reveals the body in his closet, and Georg removes the videotape, asks if anyone else knows about this, and through careful grilling finds that there are no witnesses.   Clearly disturbed, the father and mother leave Benny's room, and Benny asks that the door be left open. In the living room, Georg lists—rather dispassionately—the options they have: either to alert the authorities, with a resulting judgment of parental neglect and placement of their son in a psychiatric institution, or to destroy the evidence. Anna urges—with understated passion after warnings from Georg not to fall apart—that any option chosen must be carefully followed to its end.  Anna takes Benny on vacation to [[Egypt]], and the ever-present video camera captures them both in their hotel, in the village, touring ancient tombs, watching sail-gliders at the beach, even a private moment of Anna in the bathroom. There are several phone calls from a booth in the post office, with Benny and Anna separately taking the phone. Benny seems barely affected by any recent past, and he seems unable to fathom why his mother breaks down in sobs at one point during the vacation. When they return home after six days, the apartment is clean of any trace of the girl. Georg, who had stayed at home, succeeded in cutting the body into small enough pieces to be flushed down the toilet or otherwise inconspicuously removed. That evening, Georg asks Benny "Why did you do it?" and the reply is, "I don't know. ...I wanted to see what it's like, possibly." Benny shrugs in answer to Georg's question, "How what is?"  On video, we see another Pilot and Passengers party hosted by Eva, this time with Georg and Anna's permission. In "life," we see Anna and Georg watching the video with Benny, commenting on how much of an entrepreneur their daughter is, with Anna suggesting Georg start his own game. Later, Georg and Anna attend the concert of the choir Benny is in. The choir sings: "Despite the ancient dragon, despite the gaping jaws of death, despite the constant fear, let the world rage and toss. I stand here and sing in perfect calm." On video, we see the door of Benny's darkened bedroom, standing slightly ajar, and hear the faint voices of his parents discussing what to do. In life, a voice-over asks, "Why did you come to us now?" We see Benny being interviewed by policemen, and he answers merely, "Because." With no following questions, Benny asks, "Can I go now?" After the questioning, Benny meets Georg and Anna in the hall and, after a long moment, says merely, "''Entschuldigung''." (Excuse me, as it is used to apologize for brushing by a stranger in a crowded location.)

Later Nigel meets her much older and disabled American husband Oscar ([[Peter Coyote]]), who is acerbic and cynical, having been jaded and a failure as a writer.   Oscar invites Nigel to his cabin where he tells Nigel in great detail how he and Mimi first met on a bus in Paris and fell passionately in love. Nigel relates all to Fiona. Both are appalled by Oscar's exhibitionism, but Nigel is also fascinated by Mimi, who provokes him. Later, Oscar narrates how they explored [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[sadomasochism]], and [[voyeurism]].

Afterwards, he finds Fiona in the bar flirting with a young man. She warns Nigel not to stray too far, and that anything he can do, she can do better. Nigel goes to Oscar, who continues his narration. After two years of parties and one-night stands, he drunkenly stepped in front of a vehicle. To his surprise, Mimi came to visit him in the hospital where he was recovering from minor injuries and a broken leg. Mimi shook hands with him, then pulled him out of his bed and left him hanging in his traction device. Having become paraplegic this way, Oscar had no choice but to let Mimi move in with him again and take care of him. She reveled in dominating and humiliating him, seducing men in front of him. When Oscar was desperate and wanted to die, she gave him a gun as a birthday present. Having experienced highs and lows together, they realized they needed each other and actually got married.

A stormy sea interrupts the party and the two women leave together. Nigel goes outside clutching a bottle of liquor and screams his frustration into the wind and waves.  Nigel finds Fiona in Oscar's cabin, sleeping naked side by side with Mimi. Oscar claims the women have had sex together. Nigel grabs his throat, but Oscar points a gun at him and he backs off. Oscar shoots the sleeping Mimi several times, then kills himself. While the bodies of Oscar and Mimi are being stretchered off the ship, Fiona and Nigel, shaken, embrace each other.

The Birthday Dragon
 Three years on since first meeting the Railway [[Dragon]], Emily manages to summon him to her house one night by shouting tidings. Upon his arrival, Emily reveals to him that she would like him to come to her birthday party and meet her other friends. The dragon, however, is reluctant as he feels that the world is not yet safe for him, despite Emily telling him there are lots of people like her who can make the world safe for dragons. Furthermore, the dragon is curious as to what a birthday is. Emily shows him through a [[projector]] after going through different slides, including a picture of the forest and the zoo, before finding a picture from one of her earlier birthday parties and explaining to the dragon that a birthday is a celebration of the day you were born (although the dragon doesn't know which day is his birthday). Emily tells him about the best part of birthdays, which is receiving presents, before showing him by making him a present (wrapping up one of her old toys, a 'Noah's Ark' shaped clock), and giving it to him to unwrap, much to his delight. When Emily tells him if he comes it will be the best present she could ask for, as well as assuring him that he'll be safe, the Dragon happily agrees to come to her party before flying off into the night.  The next morning, the boss of a [[circus]] informs two bumbling clowns, Lenny and Clarence, that they have another birthday party to do. Clarence is an overweight man who enjoys clowning, but is quite dumb and easily sidetracked. Lenny, on the other hand, hates it and is constantly infuriated by Clarence while looking for a way to get a better job. At Emily's party, Emily has made everyone dress up as dragons to help the Railway Dragon blend in, which is successful. Lenny and Clarence perform to the children but both mess up, so Emily, the dragon and the children move onto the games. It all goes well, until a blindfolded child playing 'Pin the tail on the donkey' accidentally stabs the dragon in the butt, causing him to fly up and roar, scaring the children away in the process. Angry, the Dragon tells Emily it was a mistake coming to her party and flies off back to his [[Railway tunnel]], despite Emily calling for him to come back. This is watched by both Lenny and Clarence, with both realising the dragon is real and Lenny now believing they have a way to 'get to the top'.  The two clowns follow Emily to try to find the Dragon's lair, unbeknown to her. However, they lose track of her when she slides down the burrow into the Railway Dragon's lair. Although she cannot find the dragon, she tells him that just because things went bad at the party doesn't mean they can't still be friends, and states that she 'doesn't want a world without dragons' before leaving the cave. In the forest, the other dragons she met on the Day of Tidings appear to her to try and cheer her up, but she sends them away and tells them that they must hide where humans aren't looking. In his cave, the Railway dragon tearfully looks back on the days events before finding the Noah's Ark clock he received from Emily. Upset at how he has hurt Emily's feelings (especially since she cares the most about him), he comes up with a plan to make it up to her by giving her the best present ever.  That night, Emily is woken up and finds various zoo animals in her house and garden before seeing the Dragon outside and hugging him. The dragon reveals he has brought almost all the animals from the zoo (with the exception of some beetles and the crocodile) as her birthday present. Emily tells him it is a wonderful present, but it's not safe in the world right now for the animals. The dragon and Emily both agree that they must work till they make it safe again for both the zoo animals and for dragons.   They are interrupted, however, by Lenny and Clarence (who had hidden outside Emily's house). As the Dragon roars and advances towards them, the two clowns spring their trap and catch the Railway Dragon in a net attached to a circus pickup truck. As they drive off, Emily shouts tidings to call the other dragons. Together, they quickly capture both Lenny and Clarence (putting them in the net) before freeing the Railway Dragon. While the other dragons 'play' with the two clowns, Emily and the Railway Dragon manage to return all the animals back to the Zoo before the Zoo owner realises they're missing.  At the Circus, the Boss takes several days wages from Lenny and Clarence for various reasons including their 'stupid story' about the Dragons. As Lenny is about to complain to Clarence, the two look up fearfully as Emily and the Dragon fly overhead, with both clowns agreeing that they didn't see anything. In the sky, the railway dragon takes Emily for another fun ride before flying back to the railway tunnel with her. He is upset as he has not been able to give her a present to keep, but Emily reassures him that she has a wonderful present to keep; a memory of the day's events and also that she and the dragon are still friends. As the dragon happily states that the day feels like his birthday also, Emily surprises him as the other dragons appear (one holding a large cake) and wish him happy birthday, before both himself and Emily blow out the candles on the cake together.

Formerly he was a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent who served as part of the presidential protection detail during two presidencies. Frank is reluctant to accept the offer to guard Rachel as he sees her as a spoiled diva who is oblivious to the threats against her life.  Frank's concerns are quickly realized when Rachel looks upon Frank as being paranoid and his extensive protection techniques as intrusive. Rachel's existing bodyguard Tony ([[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]]) resents Frank's presence. But at a concert where Rachel is performing, a riot breaks out and Frank rescues her from danger. As a result, the two develop a closer relationship. Frank tries to remain professional, but the two sleep together. However, recognizing that this compromises his ability to protect his client, Frank breaks off their affair. Hurt, Rachel begins to defy Frank's painstaking security measures. She even goes as far as attempting to sleep with his former Secret Service colleague Greg Portman ([[Tomas Arana]]). But after she has personal contact with her stalker via a threatening phone call, Rachel realizes that she must put her trust in Frank ahead of her own desire for personal gratification. She finally recognizes the seriousness of the situation and cancels the rest of her tour.  Frank, Rachel, Rachel's driver Henry (Christopher Birt), Rachel's son Fletcher ([[DeVaughn Nixon]]), and her sister Nicki (Michele Lamar Richards) then travel to a large lakefront cabin in the mountains, the home of Frank’s father, Herb ([[Ralph Waite]]).

Upon tracking the killer and then pursuing him into the woods, Frank shoots but misses, allowing the shooter to escape capture. Frank learns the next day, from his Secret Service contacts, that they have apprehended the stalker and were interviewing him when Nicki was shot.  Frank and Rachel attend Nicki's funeral and then the [[Academy Awards]] ceremony, where Frank gives Rachel a panic button in the shape of a cross to immediately alert him to any trouble. A host of backstage technical issues hamper Frank's efforts to monitor the proceedings closely. During the actual show, Rachel freezes and runs offstage, angry at Frank for embarrassing her with overprotective measures. However, Rachel returns to the audience and is present when announced as the winner for Best Actress. As she comes toward the stage to accept the award, the hitman is revealed to be Portman. Frank notices Portman pointing a gun disguised as a camera at Rachel. As Portman prepares for the fatal shot, Frank runs on stage and leaps in front of Rachel, intercepting the shot. Once regaining his balance, Frank shoots Portman through his camera-gun, killing him. Frank is left wounded and Rachel calls for help—all the while urging him to stay with her.  Frank recovers from the shooting and goes to say goodbye to Rachel at the airport. After the plane starts to taxi, Rachel suddenly jumps out and runs to Frank for one last passionate kiss.

Bob Roberts
 ''Bob Roberts'' takes place in [[Pennsylvania]], USA in 1990. It depicts a fictitious senatorial race between a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] country singer, Bob Roberts ([[Tim Robbins]]), and the incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Brickley Paiste ([[Gore Vidal]]). The film is shot through the perspective of Terry Manchester ([[Brian Murray (actor)|Brian Murray]]), a British documentary filmmaker who is following the Roberts campaign. Through his lens we see Roberts travel across the state, performing songs about drug users, lazy people and the triumph of traditional family values over the rebelliousness of the 1960s. As the campaign continues, Paiste remains in the lead until a scandal arises involving him and a young woman who was seen emerging from a car with him. Paiste claims that she was a friend of his granddaughter whom he was driving home, but he cannot shake the accusations.   Throughout the campaign, reporter Bugs Raplin ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]) attempts to use the documentary being made about Roberts as a way to expose him to the public as a fraud. Raplin believes that Roberts' anti-drug charity, Broken Dove, is connected to an old [[Central Intelligence Agency]] [[drug trafficking]] scheme. As the election approaches, Roberts is asked to appear on a network's sketch comedy show. When Roberts announces that he will not be playing the song he had originally proposed, a dispute breaks out between the cast and producers of the show. This new song turns out to be nothing more than a thinly veiled campaign endorsement, and an angry staff member of the network pulls the plug mid-performance. As Roberts is leaving the studio, he is seemingly shot by a would-be [[assassination|assassin]]. Raplin, who has been causing problems for the campaign, is initially linked to the shooting, but he is later cleared when it is found that due to constrictive [[:wikt:palsy|palsy]] in his right hand he physically could not have fired the gun. Following the incident, Raplin contends that Roberts was never actually shot and that the gun was fired into the ground.  The campaign is boosted by public support following the assassination attempt, and Roberts wins the election with 52 percent of the vote. Although Roberts claims that his wounds have left him [[paralysis|paralyzed]] [[paraplegia|from the waist down]], he is seen tapping his feet at a celebration party. While Terry Manchester is interviewing Roberts' supporters outside the new Senator's hotel, a boy runs up shouting, "He's dead, he's dead, they got him!" When Manchester asks him what he is talking about, the boy shouts, "Bugs Raplin! He's dead! They got him!" A joyful celebration breaks out among Roberts' supporters, the shot changes to an image of his hotel room, and an upright walking shadow suggesting Roberts' profile passes the window before the lights go out. The film ends with a radio news report about Raplin's death at the hands of a [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] fanatic and a shot of Manchester standing in the [[Jefferson Memorial]], looking at the words, "I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man", inscribed there.

Blame It on the Bellboy
 Three men board the same plane at [[Heathrow]] Airport bound for [[Venice]]: Melvyn Orton, a shy and unassuming clerk with an assignment of purchasing a house in Venice under penalty of losing his job; Mike Lorton, a [[hitman]] en route to Venice to kill his next mark, and Lord Maurice Horton, a rather large man who is mayor of a small city in the [[United Kingdom]].  All register in the Hotel Gabrielli. The first to check in is Maurice. He establishes that his name is Horton with an overeager bellboy who struggles with properly pronouncing the letter "H". Melvyn arrives next. He is checked in by the hotel's manager, who initially believes that he and Mr. Horton are the same person until Melvyn clarifies the spelling of his name. Third to arrive is Mike Lorton. They are all expecting messages: Melvyn from a real estate agency that is selling a worthless villa in the [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]], Mike from the [[Mafia]] and Maurice from a dating agency called Medi-Date. When the bellboy receives the message for Melvyn, he mistakenly delivers it to Maurice. The message from Medi-Date goes instead to Mike, who now believes that his "mark" is the woman Maurice was supposed to meet with. Melvyn, meanwhile, receives Mike's instructions to 'visit' a local mob boss.  Maurice is shown around the villa by Caroline Wright, who has received instructions to sell the house immediately. If she gets the money in cash, her commission will be tripled, allowing her to purchase a [[speed boat]]. Maurice is under the false impression that they are on a date, planning to have sex with her, but is baffled by the fact that she seems very intent (supported by [[double entendre]]) to get to "the nitty gritty."  Mike is following Patricia (who was supposed to be Maurice's date) around Venice, trying to find the courage to kill her, since he is having second thoughts about his chosen profession. Melvyn calls seeking Mr. Scarpa, a mafioso who knows he is being sought by a killer, and is detained by thugs, taken to a cellar and tortured.  [[File:Piazza San Marco in Venice, with St Mark's Campanile and Basilica in the background.jpg|thumb|[[Piazza San Marco]] in Venice, with [[St Mark's Campanile]] in the background.]]  Maurice takes Caroline out for lunch, and Patricia has noticed Mike following her around and engages him in conversation. Mike is unsure of what to make of this, since he believes he is there to kill Patricia and she believes he is trying to go on a date with her. Melvyn is permitted to call his boss in England, trying to prove his story that he is there to buy Mr. Scarpa's extravagant house rather than kill him. While Scarpa and his men listen, Marshall thunders abuse at Melvyn and hangs up. Scarpa remarks that Melvyn is living life like a worm, letting his boss insult him so freely, but is still convinced he and this "Mr. Marshall" want Scarpa dead. The interrogation resumes, with Scarpa's men preparing to use electricity on Melvyn's genitals, but he remembers a man at his hotel- Maurice- with a similar last name. Scarpa and his men, now suspecting Maurice as the assassin, head to the hotel and take Melvyn with them.  Maurice has tried to make a move on Caroline, who is offended, both still mistaking other's agenda. His belief that she is a prostitute is compounded by her confusion that he would pay cash for the villa if she agrees to have sex with him.  Mike is about to kill Patricia but stops at the last minute. Everyone returns to the hotel: Maurice and Caroline to have sex, Mike to figure out what to do with Patricia, and Melvyn to check out and run for his life.  Melvyn is trapped again by the mafiosi and led upstairs to a new room. Mike and Patricia have clarified that she is not his mark and that Medi-Date is a legitimate company, not a cover. Maurice, after having sex with Caroline, informs her he isn't going to buy the villa, since he lives in England and has little use for a home in Venice. Melvyn is being tortured again when the bellboy comes in, escorting Mrs. Horton, who is irritated to discover she's been led to the wrong room.  Caroline is in Maurice's bathroom, considering the possibility that Maurice may very well cheat her out of the money he'd promised when the bellboy brings Mrs. Horton in. She has become suspicious that Maurice is cheating on her, and after speaking with his secretary became certain Maurice was going to Venice to meet another woman. Caroline uses this as a chance to blackmail Maurice, implying that if he pays one hundred thousand pounds, in cash, she will keep their [[wikt:tryst|tryst]] secret.  Maurice calls his bank manager in the UK to have the money transferred to him in Venice, a conversation overheard by Mike and the mafiosi. Mike and Patricia assume that Maurice has killed the mark and received the money, since one hundred thousand pounds was Mike's fee. The mafiosi have decided to kill Mr. Horton and Mr. Orton, convinced the former is a cleverly disguised assassin and that the latter knows too much. They obtain a remotely detonated bomb, intending to make use of it later.  Maurice receives the money, places it in a briefcase, and leaves it in the hotel safe. The mafiosi get a matching briefcase in which they hide the bomb, and upon placing it in the hotel safe swap tags on the two identical briefcases. Maurice takes his briefcase and leaves for the villa with Mike and the mafiosi in pursuit. Mike and Patricia try to steal the suitcase and a struggle ensues between them, the Hortons, and Caroline over the money. Melvyn, sitting in a raft offshore, is ordered to set off the bomb by an impatient Mr. Scarpa, whose boat is sitting further offshore, unable to get any closer. As Melvyn tries to comply, one of Scarpa's henchmen realizes a horrifying mistake- he and another of Scarpa's men both swapped the tags on the briefcases. Realizing the bomb is on the boat, Scarpa screams at his men to throw the briefcase overboard and begins firing at Melvyn with a pistol. Scarpa is trying to stop him from setting off the bomb, but Melvyn assumes the Mafiosi have become impatient and are telling him to hurry up. The detonator finally works, and Scarpa's boat explodes and sinks.  [[File:20050525-033-lido.jpg|thumb|250px|Lido [[Vaporetto]] terminal, seen from the Lagoon.]]  Mike retreats to the Hotel Gabrielli in a panic. The organization he works for doesn't forgive mistakes, and given what has happened he now fears for his life. When the bellboy knocks on the door, Mike grabs him and holds him at gunpoint while Patricia reads the message from Mike's employer: since his mark (actually Mr. Scarpa) and two of his top men were killed, he has been paid a generous bonus in addition to his original fee.  Melvyn calls Mr. Marshall and tricks him out of £355,000.00, the price for Mr. Scarpa's house in Venice. Mr. Marshall arrives at Scarpa's house sometime later, and Mr. Scarpa's men avenge their boss.  The epilogue states that Melvyn takes the money and runs for the Bahamas, where he sets up a sporting goods business specialising in testicle protectors. Caroline finally gets the speedboat she has long dreamed of owning, but it crashes due to faulty engineering and she cheerfully sues the boat's maker for all the money she can get. She later marries a [[sumo]] wrestler. The Hortons' villa falls apart and so does their marriage. The former Mrs. Horton soon finds a new and better husband, while Maurice is still looking for love. Mike and Patricia, having become very fond of each other in their time in Venice, decide to marry. Mike finally ends his career as an assassin, opening up a flower shop as he had long desired to do. Patricia goes on to represent England in the Olympics, having become exceptionally skilled with short-barrel firearms. And the bellboy eventually gets the sack.  
Bol Radha Bol
  Kishen Malhotra is an industrialist who heads the Malhotra empire. His relatives are his mother ([[Sushma Seth]]), his uncle ([[Alok Nath]]) and his cousin Bhanu ([[Mohnish Behl]]). One day, he finds his cousin defrauding the company and banishes him from the house. To expand his business, Kishen decides to investigate prospects in a village. Here, he meets a village belle named Radha ([[Juhi Chawla]]).  Besides his work, Kishen also starts teaching English to Radha and some other people of the village. Kishen and Radha slowly fall in love with each other. Unknown to Kishen, somebody is stalking him and reading his mail. Kishen leaves the village (and Radha) and  promises her that he will come back.  On reaching home, Kishen is surprised to see a mourning at his home. He is even more confused to see people looking astonishingly at him. But, he gets a shock of his life when he sees the portrait of his mother, signifying that his mother is dead. The real sucker punch comes when he sees his duplicate mourning next to his mother's portrait.  When he tells that he is Kishen, his duplicate claims the same. When he prods the duplicate to tell something about real Kishen, the duplicate astonishes him by telling him about his life as well as about Radha. Kishen is unable to think as to how the duplicate could know about Radha, but he knows that his pet dog will identify the real master. When the dog, too, goes to the duplicate, Kishen is thrown out of his own home.  Meanwhile, Kishen learns about sudden death of one of his old servants, and he smells foul play. He somehow succeeds to infiltrate into his own office, which is now run by his duplicate. But, he gets arrested. Another servant tells Kishen about his mother's accident, which probably killed her. Kishen also notices that Bhanu is back at home.  Meanwhile, Radha comes to meet Kishen in the city. But, when she sees "Kishen" partying with some girls, she thinks that Kishen has forgotten her. She turns to go back, but the real Kishen has escaped police custody. He stops her and explains the whole story. He, Radha and Goonga ([[Shakti Kapoor]]), a dumb convict who has escaped with Kishen, plan to set things straight.  The trio hide themselves in a boat which takes them to Goa. Here, Kishen meets a girl who calls him Tony. Slowly, he comes to realize that his duplicate's name is Tony Braganza. Tony works as a saxophonist in a Goan club called Three Aces and has a girlfriend there. Kishen starts gathering all information about Tony.  The trio return to Mumbai. Radha pretends to be a girl named Rita and gains access to Kishen's home. Kishen has identified key players by now: Bhanu, Tony and Inspector T.T. Dholak ([[Kiran Kumar]]). He creates a rift between the trio. An enraged Tony threatens to expose his partners by what he calls his trump card.  The angered partners take him to the real head behind the game, who is revealed to be Kishen's uncle. Now, Tony shows his trump card &mdash; he tells them that Kishen's mother is still alive and his men have kept her in captivity. She knows nothing about Tony or the events happening.  Meanwhile, Kishen discovers the depth of the trio's planning. He finds that his dog could not identify him as it was not his dog. Like Kishen, his dog, too, had been replaced. Now, Kishen comes back, impersonating Tony and makes Tony's partners throw Tony out the same way Kishen was thrown.  Tony comes to the place where he has hid Kishen's mother and convinces her that he is Kishen. Kishen arrives there, too. Kishen's mother tricks the duo and finds out who is her son. Just then, all the villains show up at Tony's den. Kishen's uncle goes on to explain that he never liked the way his dead brother left the entire estate to Kishen's mother.  He explains that Bhanu was not the only one looting the money. When Bhanu was thrown out, he went till Goa to find him, where he met Tony. As the whole plot is explained, Kishen surprises by saying that he had anticipated this. The money he used to lure out the villains was fake.  In another twist, Dholak comes out holding a gun on Radha's head. Even Kishen is surprised when Goonga re-introduces himself as Inspector Bhinde. He explains that he was sent undercover by the commissioner as even he smelled a rat.  In the melee that ensues, the villains are overpowered and arrested. Tony surprises by acknowledging his true identity and saying that there can be only one Kishen. Kishen and Radha are united.

Braindead (film)
 In 1957, explorer Stewart McAlden ([[Bill Ralston]]) and his team smuggle a captured Sumatran Rat-Monkey, a [[Hybrid (mythology)|hybrid]] creature that resulted from the rape of tree monkeys by plague-carrying rats, out of [[Skull Island]]. During the team’s escape from the island’s warrior natives, who demand the return of the creature, Stewart is bitten by the Rat-Monkey and is hacked to pieces by his crew, who fear the effects of the bite. The captured Rat-Monkey is then shipped to [[Wellington Zoo]] in [[New Zealand]].  In Wellington, Lionel Cosgrove ([[Tim Balme|Timothy Balme]]) lives in a Victorian mansion with his domineering mother Vera ([[Elizabeth Moody (actor)|Elizabeth Moody]]). When he was a child, Lionel’s father drowned trying to save him at the beach, and the incident has haunted him into adulthood. To Vera's dismay, Lionel falls in love with [[Spanish Romani]] shopkeeper's daughter, Paquita María Sánchez ([[Diana Peñalver]]), who is convinced the two are destined to be together. When the two visit the Wellington zoo together on a date, Vera follows them and is bitten by the Rat-Monkey, and though she appears fine initially, the following day she grows more and more decrepit, culminating in her eating her ear after it falls off during a lunch with friends. She appears to die before reanimating as a ravenous [[Zombie (fictional)|zombie]] and kills the attending nurse (Brenda Kendall), who also returns as a zombie, before Lionel locks them in the basement and keeps them sedated with animal tranquilisers. While visiting Paquita, Lionel is given a pendant for luck by her grandmother. Vera is able to break out of the basement and is apparently killed when struck by a [[Wellington tramway system|tram]].  At her funeral, Lionel tranquilizes Vera to keep her from attacking the mourners, and while returning to the graveyard to administer more of it he is intercepted and beaten by a group of [[hoodlums]], who assume him to be a [[necrophiliac]]. Vera bursts from her grave and in the ensuing commotion one of the hoodlums and the local priest ([[Jed Brophy]] and [[Stuart Devenie]]) are killed and turned into zombies, forcing Lionel to also hide them in the basement. After the nurse and priest copulate and produce a zombie baby, Lionel breaks up with Paquita to keep her safe. Shortly afterward Lionel's uncle Les ([[Ian Watkin]]) arrives to wrangle with Lionel over Vera's estate. Discovering the zombies, which he believes to be "[[Cadaver|stiffs]]", in the basement, Les blackmails his nephew into giving up the house and his inheritance and invites his friends over for a housewarming party despite Lionel’s objections.  During the party, Paquita arrives to try and make amends with Lionel. She discovers the zombies in the basement, and Lionel explains to her all that has occurred. She is able to convince Lionel to administer poison to the zombies to finally kill them, but after injecting the zombies with it he discovers the poison is in fact animal [[stimulants]], which revives them. They narrowly escape the now-enhanced zombies, who burst into the house upstairs and slaughter the party guests. The guests subsequently reanimate and begin to attack the survivors, including Paquita and Lionel, who are separated in the ensuing mayhem. Lionel enters the house with a lawnmower and proceeds to destroy the zombie horde within, while Paquita kills the zombified Les, who has been killed by a now-monstrous Vera. She erupts from the basement and pursues them both to the rooftop as the house catches fire from a burst gas pipe.  As Vera corners them on the roof, Lionel confronts his mother and reveals that he witnessed Vera drowning his father and his lover in the bathtub as a child, and accuses her of lying to him all his life. Vera becomes enraged and swallows Lionel with an opening in her stomach before trying to kill Paquita. Lionel cuts his way out of his mother's body with the pendant given to him earlier, causing Vera to fall back into the burning house. Lionel and Paquita escape the burning rooftop as the fire brigade arrives. They kiss as they then walk away arm-in-arm.  
Bram Stoker's Dracula
 In 1462, [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad Dracula]], a member of the [[Order of the Dragon]], returns from a [[Night Attack at Târgovişte|victory against the Turks]] to find his wife, Elisabeta, having committed suicide after receiving a false report of his death. The priest proceeds to tell him that his wife's soul is condemned for committing suicide. Enraged, Dracula desecrates the chapel and renounces his faith, declaring that he will rise from the grave to avenge Elisabeta with all the powers of darkness. He then stabs the chapel's stone cross with his sword and drinks the blood that pours out of it.  In 1897, newly qualified solicitor [[Jonathan Harker]] takes the Transylvanian [[Count Dracula]] as a client from his colleague [[Renfield]], who has gone insane. Jonathan travels to Transylvania to arrange Dracula's real estate acquisitions in London, including Carfax Abbey. Jonathan meets Dracula, who discovers a picture of Harker's fiancée, [[Mina Harker|Mina]] and believes that she is the reincarnation of Elisabeta. Dracula leaves Jonathan to be attacked and fed upon by his [[Brides of Dracula|brides]], while he sails to England with boxes of his native Transylvanian soil, taking up residence at Carfax Abbey. His arrival is foretold by the ravings of Renfield, now an inmate in Dr. [[John Seward|Jack Seward]]'s insane asylum.  In London, Dracula emerges as a wolf-like creature amid a fierce thunderstorm and hypnotically seduces,then bites [[Lucy Westenra]], with whom Mina is staying while Jonathan is in Transylvania. Lucy's deteriorating health and behavioral changes prompt her former suitors [[Quincey Morris]] and Dr. Seward, along with her fiancé, [[Arthur Holmwood]], to summon Dr. [[Abraham Van Helsing]], who recognizes Lucy as the victim of a vampire. Dracula, appearing young and handsome during daylight, meets and charms Mina. When Mina receives word from Jonathan, who has escaped the castle and recovered at a convent, she travels to Romania to marry him. In his fury, Dracula transforms Lucy into a vampire. Van Helsing, Holmwood, Seward and Morris kill the now [[undead]] Lucy the following night.  After Jonathan and Mina return to London, Jonathan and Van Helsing lead the others to Carfax Abbey, where they destroy the Count's boxes of soil. Dracula enters the asylum, where he kills Renfield for warning Mina of his presence. He visits Mina, who is staying in Seward's quarters while the others hunt Dracula, and confesses that he murdered Lucy and has been terrorizing Mina's friends. Confused and angry, Mina admits that she still loves him and remembers her previous life as Elisabeta. At her insistence, Dracula begins transforming her into a vampire. The hunters burst into the bedroom, and Dracula claims Mina as his bride before escaping. As Mina changes, Van Helsing hypnotizes her and learns via her connection with Dracula that he is sailing home in his last remaining box. The hunters depart for [[Varna]] to intercept him, but Dracula reads Mina's mind and evades them. The hunters split up; Van Helsing and Mina travel to the [[Borgo Pass]] and the castle, while the others try to stop the gypsies transporting the Count.  At night, Van Helsing and Mina are approached by Dracula's brides. Initially, they frighten Mina, but she eventually succumbs to their chanting and attempts to seduce Van Helsing. Before Mina can feed on his blood, Van Helsing places a communion wafer on her forehead, leaving a mark. He surrounds them with a ring of fire to protect them from the brides, then infiltrates the castle and decapitates them the following morning. As sunset approaches, Dracula's carriage arrives at the castle, pursued by the hunters. A fight between the hunters and gypsies ensues. Morris is stabbed in the back during the fight and at sunset Dracula bursts from his coffin. Harker slits his throat while a wounded Morris stabs him in the heart with a [[Bowie knife]]. As Dracula staggers, Mina rushes to his defense. Holmwood tries to attack but Van Helsing and Harker allow her to retreat with the Count. Morris dies of his wound, surrounded by his friends.  In the chapel where he renounced his faith, Dracula lies dying in an ancient demonic form. They share a kiss as the candles adorning the chapel light up and the cross repairs itself. Dracula turns back to his younger self and asks Mina to give him peace. Mina thrusts the knife through his heart and as he finally dies, the mark on her forehead disappears as Dracula's curse is lifted. She decapitates him and gazes up at the fresco of Vlad and Elisabeta ascending to Heaven together, reunited at long last.  
Boris and Natasha: The Movie
  The movie opens in the tiny country of [[Pottsylvania]], located between the countries [[WrestleMania]] and [[You're So Vain|Yoursovania]], where [[Fearless Leader]] concocts a plan to obtain a time-reversal microchip, invented by Professor Anton Paulovitch. He asks his top agent, Agent X (whose face is obscured), to do the assignment, but Agent X suggests they send some patsies to find Paulovitch. [[Boris Badenov]]  and [[Natasha Fatale]] accept their assignment to find the Professor, and are told to defect to America. After a number of failed attempts to get there (resulting in Fearless Leader having to save them many times), they make it to America, where they are sent to the CIA. The head of the CIA, Sheldon Kaufman, decides to have tests run on them to see if they are truly defecting. After the test, it's obvious to everyone that they should be deported, but a worker, Willie, points out they hadn't had any defections in a while, and thinks they should play along and in the meantime spy on them to see what they are after.  Boris and Natasha are given an apartment and money, while being watched from a distance by Agent X, who himself is being followed by a mysterious figure. Boris and Natasha have to meet with a secret assassin named Kalishak, who supposedly knows who they should seek, but first have to deal with their next-door neighbors, Toots and Harve, who are very interested in knowing about them. Toots assumes Boris and Natasha are a couple, and when Natasha denies it, Toots figures she's wrong. Natasha, who has become a little fascinated with America, also learns from Toots that American couples usually help each other, something Boris and Natasha do not.  They find Kalishak, who denies that he knows anything about the professor. After accepting a bribe, Kalishak acts as a shoe-shine boy and tells Boris "Search your sole", which Boris doesn't understand. After they leave, one of Kalishak's potatoes is replaced with a bomb, killing Kalishak. Natasha later sees information written on the sole of Boris' shoe, telling them to find "Minelli". Disguised as rug cleaners, they go to the location written on the shoe, where they learn that the "Minelli" they're looking for is Sal Minelli, a photographer whose photos hang on the walls, but does not actually work in that location. Natasha then gets an offer for a photo shoot and a party for it, which Boris figures will be a good opportunity to meet Sal Minelli. To pass the time before the party they go shopping at a mall, but the next day Natasha returns, going shopping with Toots, behind Boris' back. She learns that Toots doesn't need Harve's permission to do things, and learns more about their married life. Boris says a code phrase to many photographers, to no avail, before not being allowed in, but Natasha soon hits celebrity status.  Boris gets annoyed at Natasha for acting like such a celebrity, especially since Fearless Leader had ordered them to keep a low profile. But Natasha remembers what Toots had told her, and points out that she's been responsible for Boris' success, before leaving for a party. Boris starts to feel bad about their argument, while at the party Natasha keeps seeing Boris. She leaves the party, and finds Boris sleeping outside.  Sal Minelli calls their home and arranges a photo session with Natasha. It turns out Minelli is a spy as well as a photographer, and they are being spied on by Kaufman, Agent X, and the man who had been following Agent X. He informs her that Fearless Leader had sent them as patsies and that they'll be killed when they find the professor. Just when he's about to tell her the name of Agent X, Agent X kills Minelli. Boris, disguised as a cop, finds out that Agent X is actually Willie. Back at their apartment, Boris realises that they can trust nobody but themselves, and have to leave. They leave right as an assassination attempt on them occurs. Disguised as overweight Irishmen, they stay at a hotel, where they find Willie dead, and also find that he had an 11:30 train schedule. They leave with Willie, intent on hiding his body, but they encounter Harve and Toots attending a party at the hotel, and convince them Willie has had too many drinks. Boris and Natasha eventually send Willie's body down a laundry chute, only to remember that they had left the train schedule at the hotel room. When they get back, they see Paulovitch, who's revealed to the audience to be the one who had been following Agent X. He asks that they discuss the chip, which Boris and Natasha still know nothing about, but then they get a knock at the door. It's Toots and Harve, who found Willie's body and decided to return him to them. When questioned about being at a hotel when they have an apartment, they claim that they are there for relationship counseling. Once Toots and Harve are gone, they find Paulovitch missing, along with the train schedule.  They chase after Paulovitch, eventually catching a taxi, where they see Paulovitch and question him, who claims he doesn't know what they are talking about. Boris then discovers lit dynamite in the taxi, and that the driver is actually a [[Counterfeit|dummy]]. The car explodes, but then the explosion reverses. After a few explosions and reverses, they jump out of the taxi. Paulovitch tells them about the time-reversing chip and reveals that that was his first life-and-death experiment with it. He tells them about the chip, and that his evil twin brother Kreeger is also after it. Boris and Natasha become convinced to help make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands, but Paulovitch's talking lasted so long that they fell asleep. Paulovitch gets kidnapped, but Boris and Natasha find a penny, which they instantly see as a clue. They go to [[Mt. Rushmore]], where they notice a ladder going into Lincoln's nose.  There, they find Paulovitch's secret laboratory. They discover millions of time-reverse microchips, and also find Anton tied up. He tells them he was kidnapped by Kreeger, but then they learn that he is in fact Kreeger, while Anton is free. They learn that once Anton realised the microchip could be a bad thing if in the wrong hands, he tried to destroy it, only for its effect to protect it from destruction, so he had them mass-produced, with the intention of sending them to every country, potentially ending wars. Kaufman comes in, but reveals that he's not actually working for the government, but the auto industry and insurance companies, and knows that the chip could put an end to his business. Harve and Toots then show up with guns, but it's revealed that they are secretly Agents Moose and Squirrel. Fearless Leader shows up and takes over, taking the pile of microchips. After Natasha manages to make the power temporarily go out, a fight ensues, then many of them point guns at each other. Boris takes out a stick of dynamite, which he was "saving for a rainy day", and throws it at the pile of microchips, which sends them back to the very beginning of the movie. They are surprised to see Paulovitch with them when he wasn't there at the beginning, but Paulovitch guesses that there was an overload. Knowing what will happen, Boris realises that Fearless Leader must know what will happen as well, so Boris decides they will go to Tahiti (a place Natasha had earlier expressed desire to visit) instead. When Paulovitch realises that he hadn't been properly introduced to them, Boris introduces Natasha as his girlfriend.  The narrator wonders aloud if they really are safe from the danger they had avoided by going to Tahiti, asking all kinds of questions, before Boris tells him to shut up. The narrator then tells viewers to tune in to their next episode, "Goodbye Mr. Chips, or The Megabytes Back!"  
Boomerang (1992 film)
  Advertisement executive Marcus Graham tells his assistant to send flowers to nine different women, with cards reading "only thinking of you" indicating his lifestyle of dating multiple women at once. It's quickly established that Marcus won't consider settling down because he believes he hasn't met the perfect women yet.  His friends tell him that his standards are too high referencing his habit of judging women by their feet.   The next day, Marcus meets Lady Eloise, who will soon be acquiring the company in a business merger.  She suggests that Marcus may be promoted and invites him to her home.  Marcus realizes she intends to have sex with him, and, thinking of the promotion, spends the night with her.  The next day at work, he meets Jacqueline Broyer (Robin Givens), a beautiful woman who tells Marcus that Lady Eloise is a figurehead who uses her image to her advantage.  Marcus realizes that Jacqueline is going to be given the job he wanted and will soon become his boss.  At the merger party, Marcus tells his friends Tyler and Gerard he is considering resigning over not getting the promotion.  While there, Jacqueline introduces him to Angela Lewis, who works in the art department, and tells him the two of them should be working together.  Everyone is introduced to Strangé, the wild fashion diva who has been chosen as the new face of Lady Eloise Cosmetics.  While looking for Jacqueline, Marcus bumps into Angela, and when he spots Jacqueline, introduces Angela to Gerard so that he can go and catch up with her.  Though Jacqueline tells him she does not date co-workers, Marcus believes he will be the exception because of his arrogance and her flirtatiousness.  Jacqueline tells Marcus they should go over some of their work together, and Marcus suggests they do it at his place over dinner.  Marcus gets frustrated that Jacqueline is so unaffected by his seduction techniques that he begrudgingly agrees to her suggestion of watching t.v. while they eat. She is more interested in the basketball game on television and pays no attention to Marcus. Eventually the two are sent on a business trip to New Orleans where they went out together to a dance club. Marcus dances too flirtatiously with Jacqueline, so she abruptly suggests they leave. Upon returning back to the hotel, after a moment of Marcus fumbling with his key, Jacqueline invites him to her room and they have sex thus beginning their sexual relationship. Later that evening, he wakes up in the middle of the night to look at Jacqueline's feet to make sure they meet his standards and is excited to see she has beautiful feet. Happily he goes back to sleep and thinks he has met the perfect woman.   Marcus unexpectedly falls for Jacqueline who keeps him at a distance by being available on her terms, manipulates with him sex and on one occasion leaves $200 on the nightstand to repay him for inconveniencing him. While he feels he is falling in love, he does not understand how she can be so careless and inconsiderate about his feelings even though he has always treated women with the same callousness.  After Marcus discovers Jacqueline has discussed their personal business with Strangé, he tells Jacqueline they should take a break for a while.  Jacqueline bluntly tells Marcus, "It's over." Back in the office he finds himself the subject of the office women's finger pointing and snickering, so he quickly realizes that he is a topic of discussion. Everyone is surprised "the player got played". Distraught about their breakup, Marcus' work ethic begins to lag, and after he ruins a major business proposal Jacqueline gives him a few weeks off work to get himself together.  Marcus hangs out with Angela, who tries to bring him out of his funk.  On Thanksgiving, Marcus, Angela, Tyler, Gerard, and Gerard's parents meet for dinner.  While eating, Angela and Gerard deny being a couple when Gerard's father assumes they are.  When everyone else leaves, Marcus and Angela clean up and fall asleep on the couch together.  When they wake up, the two begin kissing and eventually sleep together signaling the beginning of their relationship. Later the two of them present a new ad to Jacqueline and it quickly becomes obvious to her that something is going on between Marcus and Angela because of their body language and shared looks.  While out with Gerard and Tyler, Marcus sheepishly tells Gerard he and Angela are going out together, which upsets Gerard, because he thinks Angela is too good for him. Eventually Marcus and Angela enter into a serious relationship and she moves in with him. He seems to be over Jacqueline until she calls him one morning to tell him about the success of the revised Strangé ad. Angela becomes upset that he downplays the reason for her being in his apartment by telling Jacqueline, "she just stopped by".   Marcus, now much more relaxed, confident and less needy, becomes very attractive to Jacqueline again. He easily falls for Jacqueline's flirtation, so the two sleep together causing him to get home in the middle of the night. He sneaks in the bed thinking Angela was asleep, but unbeknownst to him, she opens her eyes when he gets in the bed. The next day, Angela confronts Marcus about his whereabouts.  Upset that Marcus explains to Angela he is confused by his feelings for Jacqueline, but also cares for her, Angela immediately breaks up with him after telling him he knows nothing about love. Marcus rebounds with Jacqueline; however, he quickly realizes his feelings for her are not the same as his love for Angela so he abruptly ends a foreplay session with Jacqueline and walks out on her.  Later, Marcus talks to Gerard, and Gerard tells him that Angela got a promotion at a new company.  Marcus apologizes to Gerard, and the two make up for their argument.  He goes to Angela's new job, and though at first she is very cold towards him, she finally forgives him, and the two get back together.  
Brain Donors
  After the death of tycoon and [[philanthropist]] Oscar Winterhaven Oglethorpe, a [[ballet]] company is founded in his name by his widow, Lillian ([[Nancy Marchand]]). Ambulance-chasing attorney Roland T. Flakfizer ([[John Turturro]]) competes against Oglethorpe's former attorney, Edmund Lazlo ([[John Savident]]), to be director of the company. Lazlo is chosen for the position after signing the greatest ballet dancer in the world, Roberto "The Great” Volare ([[George de la Pena]]).  Flakfizer — with assistance from his two associates Rocco ([[Mel Smith]]) and Jacques ([[Bob Nelson (comedian)|Bob Nelson]]) — earns a spot as co-director by wooing the wealthy [[widow]] and by signing the company's leading ballerina ([[Juliana Donald]], billed as Juli Donald) and her dancer boyfriend Alan Grant (Spike Alexander). The ensuing struggle between Flakfizer and Lazlo leads to comic hijinks, including a [[badger game]] involving a chorus girl ([[Teri Copley]]), and an opening-night performance ludicrously sabotaged by Flakfizer and his cohorts.  
The Boy and the King
 The story surrounds a young boy called Obaid. He is confronted with a choice to live an easy life in this world or to struggle for reward in the [[Akhirah|hereafter]]. The story takes place during the tyrannical rule of King Narsis, who controls his people by encouraging them to worship idols and frightening them with the magic of Cinatas, his evil sorcerer. Cinatas chooses Obaid to be his student, someone who will assist him in his magic. At first, the boy is tempted by dreams of the power and the influence he will wield as the king's next sorcerer. But, soon after he starts to question his priorities. He begins talking to a righteous and a very holy man, who opens his mind to the true meaning of life.  This righteous man tells Obaid that there is only one God, [[Allah]] Almighty and that He created mankind to worship Him alone. Though these words appeal to Obaid's heart and mind, he is still pretty much confused. The righteous man advises him to seek the truth on his own – and thus begins the boy’s quest for the real meaning of life.

Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)
 High school senior [[Buffy Summers]] ([[Kristy Swanson]]) attends Hemery High School in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]; her main concerns are shopping and spending time with her rich, snooty friends and her boyfriend, Jeffrey. While at school one day, she is approached by a man who calls himself [[Minor characters of Buffy the Vampire Slayer#Merrick|Merrick]] ([[Donald Sutherland]]). He informs her that she is [[Slayer (Buffyverse)|The Slayer]], or Chosen One, destined to kill vampires, and he is a [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]] whose duty it is to guide and train her. She initially rebukes his claims, but is convinced that he is right when he is able to describe a recurring dream of hers in detail. In addition, Buffy is exhibiting uncanny abilities not known to her, including heightened agility, senses, and endurance, yet she repeatedly tries Merrick's patience with her frivolous nature, indifference to slaying and sharp-tongued remarks.  After several successful outings, Buffy is drawn into conflict with Lothos ([[Rutger Hauer]]), a local vampire king and his acolyte, Amilyn ([[Paul Reubens]]). Two young men, [[Pike (Buffyverse character)|Oliver Pike]] ([[Luke Perry]]), and best friend Benny ([[David Arquette]]), who resented Buffy and her friends due to differing social circles, are out drinking when they are attacked by Amilyn. Benny is turned but Pike is saved by Merrick. As a vampire, Benny visits Pike and tries to get him to join him. Later, when Pike and his boss are discussing Benny, Pike tells him to run if he sees him. Amilyn also abducts Cassandra, a studious girl from Buffy's class, to sacrifice to Lothos. When her body is found, the news spreads through LA and Hemery High, but her murder is met with indifference from Buffy's clique.  When Pike realizes there is something wrong with Benny and that he is no longer safe, he decides to leave town. His plan is thwarted, however, when he encounters Amilyn and his tribe of vampires. Amilyn hitches a ride on the hood of his van which crashes into a tree just before Amilyn loses an arm. Buffy and Merrick arrive to rescue him and Amilyn flees the fight to talk to Lothos. After this encounter, Buffy and Pike start a friendship, which eventually becomes romantic, and Pike becomes Buffy's partner in fighting the undead.  During a basketball game, Buffy finds out that one of the players, and a friend of Jeffrey's, is a vampire. After a quick chase to a parade float storage yard, Buffy finally confronts Lothos, shortly after she and Pike take down his gang. Lothos puts Buffy in a hypnotic trance, which is broken due to Merrick's intervention. Lothos turns on Merrick and stab him with the stake he attempted to use on him. Lothos leaves, saying that Buffy is not ready. As Merrick dies, he tells Buffy to do things her own way rather than live by the rules of others and he says "remember about the music." Because of her new life, responsibilities, and heartbreak, Buffy becomes emotionally shocked and starts dropping her Slayer duties. When she arrives at school, she attempts to explain everything to her friends, but they refuse to understand her as they are more concerned with their upcoming school dance, and Buffy falls out with them as she realizes she is outgrowing their immature, selfish behavior.  At the senior dance, Buffy tries to patch things up with her friends but they turn against her, and she is dismayed to find Jeffrey has dumped her for one of her friends. However, she meets up with Pike and as they start to dance and kiss, Lothos leads the remainder of his minions to the school and attacks the students and the attending faculty. Buffy confronts the vampires outside while Pike fights the vampiric Benny. After overpowering the vampires, she confronts Lothos inside the school and kills Amilyn. Lothos hypnotizes Buffy again and when the dance music stops, she remembers Merrick's words and is ready to defend herself. Lothos ignites her cross but she uses hairspray to create a makeshift flame-thrower and burns him before escaping back into the gym. Buffy sees everybody recover from the attack, but Lothos emerges again getting into a fight with Buffy, who then stakes him.  As all of the survivors leave, Buffy and Pike decide to finish their dance. The film then ends with the two of them leaving the dance on a motorcycle, and a news crew interviewing the students and the principal about the attack during the credits.  
Candyman (film)
 Helen Lyle, a [[Chicago]] graduate student who is researching [[urban legend]]s, hears of a local story about the Candyman. The legend claims that Candyman can be summoned by saying his name five times while facing a mirror, whereupon he will kill the summoner with a hook jammed in the bloody stump of his right arm. She encounters two cleaning ladies who tell her about Ruthie Jean, a resident in the notorious [[Cabrini-Green]] [[Public housing in the United States|housing project]] who they claim was killed by Candyman. Helen's research turns up 25 other murders in the area similar to Ruthie Jean's. Later that evening, Helen and her friend Bernadette Walsh, skeptical of Candyman's existence, call Candyman's name into the mirror in Helen's bathroom; nothing happens.  Helen learns from Professor Philip Purcell that Candyman was the son of a slave who became prosperous after developing a system for mass-producing shoes during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. He grew up in a polite society and became a well-known artist, sought after for his talent in producing portraits. After falling in love with and fathering a child with a white woman in 1890, Candyman was set upon by a [[lynching|lynch mob]] hired by his lover's father; they cut off his painting hand and replaced it with a hook. He was smeared with honey stolen from an [[apiary]], attracting hungry bees which stung him to death. His corpse was burned in a pyre and his ashes were scattered across the area where Cabrini-Green now stands.  Helen decides to write a [[thesis]] on how the residents of Cabrini-Green use the Candyman legend to cope with the hardships of living there. She and Bernadette enter the housing project to visit the scene of Ruthie Jean's murder. There, they meet Anne-Marie McCoy, one of the residents, and a young boy named Jake, who tells Helen the disturbing story of a child who was [[castration|castrated]] in a public restroom by Candyman. While Helen explores the run-down restroom, she is attacked by a gang leader who carries a hook and has assumed Candyman's moniker in order to enhance his "[[street cred]]". Helen survives the assault and is able to identify her attacker to the police, who believe him to be responsible for the killings attributed to Candyman. Helen tells Jake that Candyman is a made-up character that isn't real.  In a parking garage, Helen is confronted by the real Candyman, who explains that since Helen has discredited his legend, he must "shed innocent blood" to perpetuate belief in himself and continue his existence. Helen blacks out and wakes up in Anne-Marie's apartment, covered in blood. Anne-Marie, whose dog has been decapitated and whose baby Anthony is missing, attacks Helen; in the midst of defending herself, the police arrest Helen. Trevor, Helen's husband, bails her out of jail, but Candyman appears to Helen again and cuts her neck, causing her to bleed to the point of unconsciousness. Bernadette appears at the apartment and is murdered by Candyman, who frames Helen for the murder. Helen is sedated and placed in a psychiatric hospital.  After a month's stay at the hospital, Helen is interviewed by a psychologist in preparation for her upcoming trial. She attempts to prove her innocence by summoning Candyman, who kills the psychologist and allows Helen to escape. She returns home and briefly confronts Trevor, who is now living with Stacey, one of his female undergraduate students. Helen then flees to Cabrini-Green to confront Candyman and locate Anthony, finding [[mural]]s depicting Candyman's lynching. Helen tracks down Candyman, who tells her to surrender to him to ensure the baby's safety. Offering Helen immortality, Candyman opens his coat to reveal a ribcage wreathed in bees and kisses her. After Candyman vanishes with Anthony, Helen finds a mural of Candyman alongside his lover, who bears a striking resemblance to Helen. This and a message left by Candyman imply that Helen's a [[reincarnation]] of said lover.  Candyman promises to release Anthony if Helen helps him incite fear among Cabrini-Green's residents. However, in order to feed his own legend, Candyman reneges and attempts to immolate them all in a [[bonfire]] when it is lit by the residents. Helen manages to save Anthony while Candyman is destroyed in the fire, but Helen ultimately succumbs to severe burns. The residents, including Anne-Marie and Jake, pay their respects at her funeral, with Jake tossing Candyman's hook into her grave. Afterwards, Trevor faces his bathroom mirror and says Helen's name five times in grief. As a result, Helen's vengeful spirit is summoned and kills Trevor with Candyman's hook, leaving his body to be found by Stacey. In Candyman's former lair, a new mural of Helen with her hair ablaze is seen, showing she has now entered folklore.  
Captain Ron
 Martin Harvey is a middle-aged office worker who lives in  [[Chicago]] with his wife, Katherine, 16-year-old daughter, Caroline, and 11-year-old son, Ben. When he learns his recently deceased uncle has bequeathed him a 60' yacht once owned by [[Clark Gable]], he decides to take his family to the island of St. Pomme de Terre ("Saint Potato") to retrieve it so he can sell it. Katherine resists the idea, but agrees after Caroline announces she has just become engaged.  When the Harveys arrive at the island, they discover that the yacht, the ''Wanderer'', is in terrible condition. Upon hearing this, the yacht broker cancels his plan to send an experienced captain to help them sail it to Miami, and instead hires a local sailor, Captain Ron Rico, a one-eyed man with a very laid back attitude, and Navy veteran who claims to have piloted the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS ''Saratoga'']]. He launches immediately when he sees the car he arrived in roll off the dock and sink. Its owner arrives at the dock and shoots at him.  Captain Ron takes Ben's money in a game of Monopoly, giving him beer to drink and charging him for it later, but shows loyalty to Martin, who he refers to as "Boss". Martin, who doesn't like him, calls him "[[moron (psychology)|Moron]]" in his diary, and believes that he doesn't know what he's doing.  The Harveys decide to stop off in the Caribbean, but learn that Captain Ron doesn't know how to navigate. While on a random island, Martin decides to go on a nature hike, but runs into [[guerrilla]]s led by General Armando. Captain Ron bargains for Martin's freedom by giving them a lift to the next island, and receiving some firearms in return to fight off pirates. This angers Martin, as he declares there will be no firearms on his yacht and tosses them overboard, before realizing that without them, he is going to have to give the guerrillas a lift.  In the yacht's cabin, Katherine shows Martin the initials of Clark Gable and [[Carole Lombard]] marked on the bedpost. They are so excited that they share their feelings and have passionate sex.  When they arrive at their next destination, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], Martin and Katherine are arrested for smuggling the guerrillas. Caroline and Ben party with the locals and Captain Ron, which ends with Caroline getting a tattoo, Ben breaking his glasses, and Captain Ron losing his glass eye. Martin and Katherine are released from jail, but forced to leave that night. Martin decides to leave Captain Ron behind and they encounter pirates who steal the yacht, and are stuck floating in a raft.  They land in [[Cuba]] and discover the yacht there. The pirates find them, but with the help of Captain Ron, they are able to escape with the yacht. Captain Ron learns that they underrate Martin, and he decides to play hurt, forcing Martin to take control of the escape. Using the skills that Captain Ron taught them, they are able to get the sails up after the engine breaks from lack of oil to distance themselves from the pirates. The [[United States Coast Guard]] fires once at the pirates, scaring them away and creates a safe passage to Miami.  They arrive in Miami and part ways with Captain Ron. As they sail to their destination, they decide to turn the yacht around and keep it. In the final scene, Captain Ron appears to have cleaned up his appearance and has quickly taken on a new role as a captain for wealthy couple and their small motorboat. Notably he is no longer wearing an eye patch. This has led many to believe that Captain Ron is in fact a con man who has assumed many different appearances across his travels. What exactly he gained from the Harvey Family Con, remains something of a mystery.

Careful (1992 film)
 Careful is set in Tolzbad, a fictional mountain town under constant threat of devastating avalanches that can be triggered by any loud noise or even a too-large expression of emotion.  The people of Tolzbad suppress their emotions as much as possible, living in constant vigilance against losing self-control. An opening lecture cautions common advice ("Think twice!", "Don't stand so close to the walnut tree!").  The greatest ambition of the citizens of Tolzbad is to become good servants for the reclusive Count Knotkers.  Johann and Grigorss are brothers and butlers-in-training.  Both are beloved of their mother Zenaida, although she hates their brother Franz, whom they do not speak of and who has been exiled to the attic.  The ghost of their dead blind father appears to Franz to warn him of impending doom in the family, yet Franz, paralyzed and mute and covered in cobwebs, can do nothing.  The ghost complains to Franz that Zenaida never loved him and harboured love for Count Knotkers instead, although forbidden to marry him by the Count's mother.  Johann is betrothed to Klara, daughter of Herr Trotta, and although Grigorss harbours secret love for Klara he says nothing.  Johann, meanwhile, becomes incestuously attracted to his own mother Zenaida.  He spies on her through the walls of the chimney as she undresses and bathes.  He then concocts a love potion for her, and as she drifts into sleep he assaults her, kissing and groping her breasts.  Horrified at himself, Johann burns off his lips with a hot coal, cuts off his fingers with garden shears, and throws himself off a mountain.  Grigorss becomes infuriated when Zenaida reveals that her passion for Count Knotkers has been rekindled since his mother died, so that no obstacles stand in the way of their union.  She reveals that the reason she hates Franz but loves her other sons is because Franz reminds her too much of her hated dead husband, but when she conceived Grigorss and Johann she was thinking about the Count. Grigorss challenges the Count to a duel to avenge his father's honour, but Zenaida talks him out of it by finally accepting Franz into the family.  However, Klara convinces Grigorss to go through with the duel.  Klara has an incestuous love for her her father, Herr Trotta, who ignores her, but lavishes attention on her sister Sigleinde.  Inspired after viewing the enchained wild mountain girl Gerda, this duel is the first step for Klata to plan her revenge. They duel with daggers, and Grigorss stabs Count Knotkers.  He heads home, where Zenaida cares for him after he collapses from exhaustion.  However, when she discovers he has killed her beloved Count, she throws him out of the house and hangs herself in the attic in front of Franz.  Grigorss is taken by Klara to a mountain cave she once hopefully prepared as a love den for her and her father, she now claims that this can be their new home.  On the gondola ride there, Klara tells Grigorss that her father raped her and they must plan his death.  Grigorss takes Herr Trotta on a sleigh ride, during which he shoots a pistol to start an avalanche to bury Trotta.  All goes according to plan, except that Klara throws herself into the sleigh to die while kissing her father.  Alone, Grigorss retreats to the mountain cave. A single teardrop causes another avalanche, which traps him inside, where he freezes to death while hallucinating a happy reunion with his parents.  As the film ends, Franz and Sigleinde join together to search the mountains for their lost family members, not realizing they are dead.  
Chaplin (film)
 The film is structured around lengthy flashbacks as the elderly [[Charlie Chaplin]] (now living in [[Switzerland]]) recollects moments from his life during a conversation with fictional character George Hayden, the editor of his autobiography.   Chaplin's recollections begin with his childhood of extreme poverty from which he escapes by immersing himself in the world of the London music halls. After his mother [[Hannah Chaplin]] has an attack of nerves on stage during a performance, the four year old Chaplin takes his mother's place on the stage. Hannah retires from performing and is eventually committed to an asylum after developing [[psychosis]]. In the years that follow, Chaplin and his brother [[Sydney Chaplin|Sydney]] gain work with variety show producer [[Fred Karno]], where Chaplin becomes a hit with his comedy drunk act. He begins a relationship with his first love [[Hetty Kelly]]; the night before he is due to leave for America he proposes to her but she declines, reasoning she is too young. Chaplin promises to return to England for her when he is a success.  Chaplin is sent to America by Karno and is given a job by [[Mack Sennett]], the most famous comedy producer in Hollywood. While there, he creates his iconic Tramp persona and due to the terrible directorial capabilities of Sennett's wife Mabel, Chaplin is allowed to direct his own movies. Before the year is over, Chaplin directs over 20 movies. After Sydney joins him in America to become his manager, Chaplin decides to break away from Sennett to have complete creative control over his films with the goal of one day owning his own studio. In 1917, Chaplin completes work on ''[[The Immigrant (1917 film)|The Immigrant]]'' which causes some concern over the film's political subject matter and starts a brief romance with actress [[Edna Purviance]].   Years later at an industry party thrown by [[Douglas Fairbanks]], Chaplin meets and begins dating child actress [[Mildred Harris]]. Chaplin eventually becomes wealthy and profitable enough to set up his own studio and becomes "the most famous man in the world" all before his thirtieth birthday. Chaplin reveals to Fairbanks that he is to marry Harris as she is pregnant, but later at a party thrown by [[William Randolph Hearst]], the pregnancy is revealed to be a hoax. At the same party, Chaplin has an uncomfortable confrontation with [[J. Edgar Hoover]] about actor / directors and their responsibilities with regards to audiences, this confrontation sparks a forty year long vendetta and Hoover attempts to ruin Chaplin's reputation.   Chaplin and Mildred separate after the premature death of their only child and Chaplin's utter devotion to his films. During the divorce proceedings, Harris's lawyers attempt to steal Chaplin's movie [[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]] reasoning that it is an asset, however Chaplin and Sydney finish editing the film in a remote hotel in Salt Lake City, Utah, and smuggle it successfully back to Los Angeles.  The brothers eventually arrange for their mother to join them in America. Chaplin is initially happy to see her but has been away from her for so long that he is unable to cope with her worsening mental illness. In 1921, seeking a break from film-making and his private life, Chaplin returns to England to attend the UK premiere of The Kid. He reunites with Karno and hopes to locate Hetty, but Karno sadly informs him that she died in a flu epidemic shorty after the war. Chaplin also discovers that although most are happy to see him, his success has meant that the poverty stricken working class British no longer consider him to be one of their own and resent him for not fighting in the war as they did.   Back in America, Hoover is beginning to investigate Chaplin's private life, suspecting that he may be a member of the [[Communist Party]], and Chaplin is forced to consider the implications the introduction of "talkies" may have on his film-making career. Despite the arrival of sound pictures drawing nearer, Chaplin vows never to make a talkie featuring the Tramp.   In 1923, Chaplin makes ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' and marries his leading lady [[Lita Grey]], with whom he goes on to have two children, however Chaplin later confides to George that he always thought of her as a "total bitch" and dedicates no more than five lines to her in the finished autobiography. Years pass and although Chaplin finds a new wife in [[Paulette Goddard]] he feels a sense of guilt and sympathy to the millions of Americans who have recently been made unemployed due to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall Street Crash]] (Chaplin avoided losing all of his money in [[The Great Depression]] by selling most of his shares the year before). Chaplin decides to address the issue in his next movie ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' (the final movie to feature The Tramp) but his complete dedication to getting the movie finished puts excessive strain on his home life and eventually results in the breakup of his marriage.   At an industry party Chaplin causes a minor scandal when he refuses to shake hands with a visiting member of the Nazi party. Fairbanks (with his health in great decline) comments that Chaplin looks a lot like [[Adolf Hitler]], providing Chaplin with inspiration for his next movie in their final encounter before Fairbanks' death in 1939. Chaplin's film satirizing the Nazis [[The Great Dictator]] is a huge hit throughout the world but Hoover tries to portray the film as a work of anti-American propaganda.  Chaplin settles down with and marries [[Oona O'Neill]], an actress who looks identical to his first love Hetty Kelly and the woman he will spend the remainder of his life with. However Chaplin is hit with another scandal when it is alleged that he is father to the child of his former lover [[Joan Barry (American actress)|Joan Barry]] and despite a blood test proving that the child is not his, Chaplin is ordered to provide financial support for the child. His reputation severely damaged, Chaplin stays out of the public eye for over seven years until re-emerging to produce a new film ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]''.   In 1952 during the height of the [[Joe McCarthy]] scandal, Chaplin leaves America with Oona on a trip back to Britain, but subsequently finds out that the [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] has revoked Chaplin's [[re-entry permit|permit to re-enter the United States]].  In 1972, 10 years after Chaplin and George complete his autobiography, Chaplin is invited back to America in order to receive a special Lifetime Achievement award at the [[44th Academy Awards|1972 Academy Award]] ceremony. Though Chaplin is initially still resentful at being exiled from the country and fearful that no one will remember him, the audience happily rejoices upon seeing his classic film clips. Chaplin stands on the stage and is moved to tears when the audience provide him with the Oscar's longest standing ovation.  
Chamatkar
 Sunder Srivastava ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) is a young graduate. His main ambition in life is to fulfil his father's dream of starting a school on his half-[[acre]] property in his village, though he has no funds to execute his plans. Sunder's childhood friend Prem, a seasoned conman in Mumbai, convinces the gullible Sunder to mortgage. When Sunder comes to Mumbai, he is first tricked and loses his luggage, then pick-pocketed and loses his money. He then finds that Prem tricked him and fled to Dubai with his money. Sunder is forced to take shelter in a cemetery. Sunder starts cursing his stars and venting his anger. A voice responds to him and a surprised Sunder asks the person to identify himself. The source of the voice, who cannot be seen, is surprised and asks Sunder whether the latter can really hear him.  Sunder realizes that he has been talking with a ghost and panics. The ghost suddenly becomes visible to Sunder and introduces himself as Amar Kumar alias Marco ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]). Marco tells Sunder that only he can help Sunder and vice versa. Marco tells his story. Marco was an underworld gangster who fell in love with one Savitri Kaul ([[Malvika Tiwari]]), daughter of one Mr. Kaul ([[Shammi Kapoor]]). Savitri declined to marry him if he did not change his ways. To show that he was serious, Marco resolved to give up crime. This did not bode well for his protégé Kunta ([[Tinu Anand]]), who wanted to become as big as Marco himself. On his wedding night, Marco was kidnapped and killed by Kunta, after which he was buried in the cemetery. Marco tells Sunder that many crimes taking place in the city under his name are actually done by Kunta and his minions.  Marco tells Sunder that due to his sins, he cannot attain redemption. Marco was foretold that only his savior would be able to see and hear him, so Sunder has to help him. Sunder declines, but Marco surprises him by reminding him of his dream, about which Sunder had not told a thing to Marco. Marco tells him that he wants to see Savitri and Mr. Kaul. He also tells that he cannot touch or harm anybody until time comes. Marco manages to get Sunder a position as a cricket coach in a school run by Mr. Kaul. Marco is angered when he finds out that   after his murder, Kunta and his goons came to the Kaul household and told Savitri that Marco was alive and had fled India never to come back, suggesting that Marco only married her in order to sleep with her. Kunta had told them that Marco wanted Savitri and her father to hand over the ownership documents for his hotel to Kunta, but Savitri refused to hand them over unless Marco himself came to ask for them. Kunta then tried to rape Savitri, but was stopped when her father broke down, promising to give them the documents. Hearing all of this, Marco is furious and vows revenge. He is grieved to then find out that Savitri died some time afterwards, but overjoyed when he learns that he has a daughter from the wedding night with Savitri called Mala ([[Urmila Matondkar]]).  Sunder and Marco also find out that the school lacks funding and that Kunta is trying to usurp its land. Mala and Sunder start falling in love. Marco helps and keeps Kunta's goons away. Later, Marco shows a secret room to Sunder where he had kept all his loot. The room was not known to Kunta or anybody else, so Marco proposes that an anonymous donation be made, which will be more than enough to save the school and help Sunder. However, due to their oversight, Kunta finds out the location of the room, and Marco loses all his money. In a desperate bid, Marco steals some money and bets to double the money. Sunder is held responsible for the theft, although no proof is present. Marco tells the truth to Sunder, and they have a fall-out.  Sunder agrees to a cricket match between his team and a team headed by Kunta's nephew: if they win the game, they will win funds to keep the school. Initially, Sunder's team is losing, but Marco then steps into the game (still invisible to everyone), sabotages the opponent team and helps Sunder's team, leading Sunder's team to succeed massively.

The Chekist
  The film is set during the [[Russian Civil War]] in the period of the [[Red Terror]]. In provincial [[Cheka]] routine work is taking place: leader Andrey Srubov and his assistants Ian Pepel and Isaac Katz read out a long list of enemies of the working people. These enemies are Christians, priests and monks, noblemen, intellectuals, Tsarist officials, military men and others considered enemies or potential enemies of the state. They are always found guilty and the sentence, regardless of the gender and age of the person, is the same - to be shot. Some of the condemned are people who opposed the Bolsheviks, but most are people not guilty of anything.  The terrible conveyor of death operates in the basement: the prisoners are taken out of their cell, ordered to undress, five people are placed against the wall and shot in the head. The bodies are then dragged by feet through a special window, loaded into a truck and taken away.  Head of Cheka Srubov describes the concept of the necessity of violence in the affairs of the Revolution. If ordinary executors simply take their revenge on the bourgeois with sadistic pleasure, enjoying the animal fear of victims, their pleas for mercy, then Srubov justifies the horrible bloodbath with certain public welfare. Pangs of conscience become so unbearable to Srubov that he goes mad and everything seems filled with blood.

The people of Hemingford decide to adopt the surviving children from Gatlin, intending to help them start new lives. Unfortunately for the well-meaning locals, the children return to the cornfield where one of the cult members, Micah, is possessed by He Who Walks Behind the Rows, the demonic entity the cult worships.  Caught in the middle are city reporter John Garrett and his son Danny, who are having a bitter falling out over John's failed relationship with Danny's mother. John is in town working on a story about the children to save his career, presently in a downward spiral. He runs into two of his former coworkers, Bobby Knite and fellow reporter Wayde McKenzie, who are on their way out of town before being killed in a nearby cornfield after taking a shortcut in their van by a mysterious, powerful storm which lasts only minutes and causes the surprisingly sharp cornstalks to wreak havoc. Back in town, John meets bed and breakfast owner Angela Casual and they soon become lovers. Danny, looking to distance himself from his father, befriends orphaned local girl, Lacey, who tells him a few disturbing details about Gatlin.  Micah and the other children murder a local woman, Ruby Burke, by sabotaging the hydraulic jacks supporting her house while she is underneath it, causing it to descend and crush her. Micah then kills another person in the town, David Simpson, during church services with a knife and a wooden voodoo doll, which causes him to bleed to death. John begins to ask the town doctor questions about what is going on, but the doctor acts suspiciously and asks John to leave. The doctor is later stabbed to death in his office by the children. Micah and the children later kill Mrs. Burke's sister, Mrs. West, in the road making it appear that she had been struck by a car.  John partners with Frank Red Bear, a professor at a nearby University, to try and make some sense of the recent chaos and death. They discover that certain residents of the town are selling spoiled corn from the previous year's harvest along with the new crop. The spoiled corn has a dark green acidic toxin growing on it which they believe is filling the town's air and contributing to a spate of delusions in the children, rendering them emotionless and violent. The town Sheriff discovers them spying on the site of his (and the dead town doctor's) misdeeds, ties them up, and tries to kill them with a corn harvester, but they escape.  The Sheriff and the rest of the Hemingford adults attend an emergency town hall meeting to discuss the situation, but the children lock them inside and set the building on fire killing all of them. The children then kidnap Angela and Lacey and bring them out into the cornfield where they are pressuring a confused Danny to join them in sacrificing Lacey. John and Frank arrive driving the harvester. One of the children shoots Frank with an arrow, wounding him. Danny and John free Lacey and Angela and attempt to escape but the cornfield seemingly never ends and they shortly return to where they started. Micah attempts to harness the power of He Who Walks Behind the Rows until Frank restarts the harvester, before finally dying. Micah's robe becomes caught in the machine, as he calls for help. Micah's face transforms, first into the demon that possessed him, then back to himself again. Danny runs in to help him but is too late. Micah is pulled in by the harvester and killed. The rest of the children scatter, and Danny, Angela, Lacey, and John leave the clearing.  John and Danny later reconcile as they burn Frank's body and give him a funeral before they, Angela, and Lacey drive off together, presumably returning to the city.  Some unspecified time later, it is revealed that Frank's spirit has become the protector of Hemingford.

Chinna Gounder thanks Deivanai for her timely help and offers her money which she does not accept. Chinna Gounder is impressed seeing her genuineness.  Deivanai owes some money from the villagers which she had borrowed for her younger sister's education. As she could not repay the debt in the timely manner, she was asked by the villagers to serve food for everyone and collect some money donated by the invitees after having the food (that is the custom followed in the village for those who are unable to repay debt). Chinna Gounder offers a marriage proposal to Deivanai as he says he is also bound to repay for the timely help offered by her, which saved his mother’s life.  Chinna Gouder is married to Deivanai, and life progresses smoothly for sometime, until Sakkara Gounder interferes with a plan. Sakkara Gounder poisons the local pond and blames Chinna Gounder for that. He also sets up a false witness to trap Chinna Gounder.

Later, the police arrests Deivanai with a murder charge, as the man whom she attacked is dead. Deivanai is jailed in the event of saving her husband.  Deivanai’s sister now comes to Chinna Gounder’s home as she is left alone. One day, it is revealed that Deivanai’s sister is pregnant, and Chinna Gounder is blamed for that too. As Chinna Gounder also remains silent over the issue, his mother sends him out of their house. Deivanai is shocked hearing this and believes that her husband has betrayed her trust and love. She refuses to even meet him when he comes to visit her in jail.  A few months pass by, and Deivanai comes from jail to visit her sister, who is about to deliver a baby. She scolds her sister for having illegitimate relationship with Chinna Gounder. But her sister reveals that he is no way related to her pregnancy. A small flashback is shown where Deivanai’s sister was in love with a local villager (the same guy who was falsely set up as a witness against Chinna Gounder and was killed by Deivanai) following which she got pregnant. As Chinna Gounder does not want to tarnish her image in front of the villagers, he accepted the blame. Deivanai realizes her mistake and apologizes to her husband. Deivanai’s sister gives birth to a baby and dies.  Now the advocate, who already knows about Chinna Gounder, finds out that he is in trouble, and decides to offer help. He takes over the case in favor of Deivanai and begins his ground work. He gets the postmortem report and finds out that the cause of death of the man attacked by Deivanai was lack of breath. Meanwhile, Deivanai is kidnapped by Sakkara Gounder. Chinna Gounder comes to the rescue and saves her. Chinna Gounder produces Sakkara Gounder in front of the village panchayat, where it is revealed that it was him who killed the witness and decided to blame Deivanai. In the end, Chinna Gounder and Deivanai come out clean from the accusations made over them. Sakkara Gounder begs pardon to the villagers, but no one listens to him.

Ciao, Professore!
 Marco Tullio Sperelli is a professor of Italian language for children from the region of [[Liguria]] in northern Italy. Due to a failure of the [[Ministry of Education]], he is transferred not to another northern town, but instead a similar-sounding town near [[Naples]], in southern Italy. There he finds a school where the students, teachers and parents deal with the poverty of the south in a resigned and practical manner that he feels are unworthy of the morality, ethics and education children should learn. (For example, most of the children avoid school because they must work for a living to help support their families).  Initially contemptuous of the attitudes in the south, and linking them to the underlying poverty, Marco Tullio requests a transfer back north. In the meantime, things are brought to a head by Raffaele, a student registered to his class who only shows up to recruit other children into the gangster lifestyle. Marco Tulio slaps Raffaele for threatening him with physical violence, and is then appalled when - instead of being scandalized by the event - the principal, children and even the boy's mother are encouraged by it because it means he may do what needs to be done to set the children on the right path. Marco Tulio rescinds his request for a transfer. Eventually, Raffaele grows respect for Marco Tulio after he helps save Raffaele's mother, who has become ill and needs transport to the hospital.  In the end, Marco Tulio is transferred (it is implied that the principal, who does not like him for his arrogance, pushed the transfer through). As his train pulls away, he reads Raffaele's homework essay - the first homework he has handed in - which discusses the end of the world, and how many people will go to Hell, but some may yet enter Heaven. He ends with, "as for me, let's hope I make it" (hence the Italian version of the film title), implying that his improved behavior will not end with Marco Tulio's departure.

In effect, Blade is surprised to find out that he is being placed in [[Gifted education|gifted classes]], while Duncan is shocked to be placed in minimal classes with substandard conditions and miscreants for classmates.  Blade realizes this and sees Duncan as his ticket permanently out of jail, since Duncan could pass his classes with ease. He transforms Duncan into a version of himself with dreadlocks, and does his best to teach Duncan how to act and talk like a gangsta. Having no grasp of [[hip hop culture]], Duncan's parents begin to worry about their son's new "friend"; his father especially, beginning to suspect Duncan is [[homosexuality|gay]].  Blade manages to smooth-talk his way through his advanced classes, even successfully executing a dissertation on sexual intercourse (one of his favorite subjects). Duncan ends up running into a high school thug named Wedge, and gets in trouble, but also ends up discovering an uncanny ability to kick field goals, and joins the school's football team. Both Blade and Duncan end up with girlfriends that the other would have, with Blade smooth-talking the intelligent but excitement-seeking Ellen and Duncan being pursued by the wild Damita (Alysia Rogers).  A drug dealer named Mink was told by his employee Wedge that Blade Brown was stepping into his territory and a chase involving the guys and their girlfriends and one of Duncan's new buddies ensues. The gang briefly lose Wedge and Mink and go to Damita's work (a wax museum), but are discovered by Mink and Wedge. Once there, the girlfriends realize that their men are swapped, and both guys eventually end up dumped. Still, Duncan manages to knock out Wedge in the museum, while Blade handles Mink, but they all end up in jail.  After the mix-up is corrected, Blade, Duncan and company are all set free. In an anti-climax, Duncan and Blade both enter a [[Brain Bowl|Knowledge bowl]] in an effort to get Blade back with Ellen. They succeed when Blade answers a tiebreaker question to win the competition, recalling a choice tidbit Ellen once told him. Afterward, both couples end up together. In a final scene, Duncan's dad finds out the hard way that Duncan is definitely not gay by catching him and Damita having sex in Duncan's bedroom. However, after returning to his room with his wife, he expresses relief and noted that his son's girlfriend is "stacked".  Walking in each other's shoes dramatically changed the lives of both Duncan and Blade. In the epilogue, the audience learns that Blade graduated from high school and attended Hafford (even wearing preppy attire), while Duncan attended Stanford on a football scholarship.

Consenting Adults (1992 film)
 Composer Richard Parker and his wife Priscilla live an ordinary suburban life until they meet their new neighbors Eddy and Kay Otis. The two couples became friends. Kay's talent for blues singing gets Richard's attention, and Eddy is attracted to Priscilla. It becomes clear that Eddy is a scam artist who fakes a neck injury after an auto accident for the insurance proceeds, the majority of which he offers to the Parkers as a gift. Eddy chastises Richard for not living dangerously, and suggests they swap mates for an evening.  The plot takes a nasty turn when Richard does sleep with Kay (supposedly without her realizing that he is not her husband) and Kay turns up bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat the next morning. Later, it is revealed that Eddy spent the night elsewhere in order to establish an airtight [[alibi]]. Richard's fingerprints are on the bat (the two couples having played a friendly game of [[softball]] earlier that day) and his semen is found in her body, so he is charged with the crime. Insult is added to injury as Priscilla disowns and divorces Richard due to his infidelity. Eddy soon becomes Priscilla's lover and a substitute father to Richard's child.  A distraught Richard finally finds a ray of hope when he discovers that Kay is alive, recognizing her voice singing in a radio talent show. With the help of a [[private investigator]] hired by the insurance company from which Eddy is attempting to collect a $1.5 million [[indemnity]] claim, Richard tracks her down and learns the truth of how he was betrayed.

Implicated in a second murder, Richard must now flee the scene as police sirens approach.  Priscilla discovers a forgotten plane ticket Eddy used on the night of the second murder. Now realizing Eddy's guilt, she worries over what to do about it.

However, she also hears the voice of a little girl, Sophie, who recounts her short and troubled life in her small town, which once stood on a lush shore but has since been destroyed by an [[Environmental disaster|ecological catastrophe]]. One night, a boat discharged illegal [[toxic waste]] that poisoned the fish and local fisherman, eventually contaminating all the vegetation on the coast and the region's inhabitants. Sophie's story is recounted twelve months after the ecological disaster first struck that strip of land, forever ruining the habitat and claiming many lives, including that of the child herself.

The Crying Game
 At a fairground in rural [[Northern Ireland]], [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] volunteer Fergus ([[Stephen Rea]]) and a unit of other IRA members, including a woman named Jude ([[Miranda Richardson]]), led by Maguire ([[Adrian Dunbar]]), kidnap Jody ([[Forest Whitaker]]), a [[black British]] soldier, after Jude lures him to a secluded area with the promise of sex. The IRA demands the release of imprisoned IRA members, threatening to execute Jody in three days if their demands are not met. Fergus guards Jody and develops a bond with him, much to the chagrin of the other IRA men; Jody tells Fergus the story of [[the Scorpion and the Frog]].  Jody persuades Fergus to promise to seek out his girlfriend Dil ([[Jaye Davidson]]) in [[London]] should Jody be killed. The deadline set by Jody's captors passes and with none of the IRA's demands being met, Jody is to be killed. When Fergus takes him into the woods to carry out the sentence, Jody makes a break for it. Fergus cannot bring himself to shoot the fleeing Jody in the back but Jody is accidentally run over and killed by a British [[armoured personnel carrier]], as they move in to assault the IRA safe-house. With his IRA companions seemingly dead after the attack, Fergus flees to London, where he takes a job as a day labourer, using the alias "Jimmy". A few months later, Fergus finds Dil at a hair salon and later they talk in a bar, where he sees her singing "[[The Crying Game (song)|The Crying Game]]".  Fergus is guilty about Jody's death and sees him in his dreams bowling a [[cricket ball]] to him. He pursues Dil, protecting her from an obsessive suitor and falling in love with her. Later, when he is about to make love to her in her apartment, he discovers that she is [[transgender]]. His initial reaction is of revulsion; rushing to the bathroom to vomit, he accidentally hits Dil in the face. A few days later he leaves her a note and the two make up; despite everything, Fergus is still attracted to Dil. Around the same time, Jude unexpectedly reappears in Fergus' apartment and tells him that the IRA tried and convicted him ''in absentia'' and she forces him to agree to help with a new mission to aid in assassinating a judge. She also mentions that she knows about Fergus and Dil, warning him that the IRA will kill her if Fergus does not co-operate.  Fergus, unable to overcome his feelings for Dil, continues to woo her. To shield her from possible retribution, he gives her a haircut and menswear as a disguise. The night before the IRA mission is to be carried out, Dil gets heavily drunk and Fergus escorts her to her apartment, where she asks him to stay with her. Fergus complies, then admits he had an indirect hand in Jody's death. Dil, drunk, appears not to understand but in the morning, before Fergus wakes up, Dil ties him to the bed. She unwittingly prevents Fergus from joining the other IRA members and completing the assassination. Holding Fergus at gunpoint, Dil forces him to tell her that he loves her and will never leave her. She unties him, saying that, even if he is lying, it is nice to hear his words. Dil then breaks down in tears.  Jude and Maguire shoot the judge but Maguire is killed by one of the bodyguards. A vengeful Jude enters Dil's flat with a gun, seeking to kill Fergus for missing the assassination. Dil takes several shots at Jude, hitting her, whilst stating that she is aware that Jude was complicit in Jody's death and that Jude used her sexuality to trick him. Dil finally kills Jude with a shot in the neck. She then points the gun at Fergus but lowers her hand, saying that she cannot kill him, because Jody will not allow her to. Fergus prevents Dil from shooting herself and tells her to hide out in the club for a while. When she is gone, he wipes her fingerprints off the gun (replacing them with his own), and allows himself to be arrested in her place. A few months later, Dil visits Fergus in prison where he is serving six years. After discussing his post-release plans, she asks why he took the fall for her, and he responds, "As a man once said, it's in my nature.".  He tells her the story of the Scorpion and the Frog.  
Critters 4
  The film begins where the [[Critters 3|previous film]] left off, as Charlie McFadden ([[Don Keith Opper]]) still in his role as an alien bounty hunter, is about to destroy two Critter eggs. He is suddenly stopped by a hologram message from his alien friend Ug (Terrance Mann), who tells him the eggs are the last two Critters in existence and that it is against an intergalactic law to cause their extinction. Charlie protests that the Critters are too dangerous to keep alive, but he obeys Ug's orders to place the eggs in a preservation capsule that suddenly falls from the sky. As Charlie puts the eggs in the pod, the hatch closes on him and he is launched into space.  Over a half-century later, in 2045, the crew of the salvage ship RSS ''Tesla'' finds the pod in deep space and bring it aboard. The ship is crewed by the shady and lecherous Captain Rick Buttram ([[Anders Hove (actor)|Anders Hove]]); along with his eccentric engineer Al "Albert" Bert ([[Brad Dourif]]); pilot Fran ([[Angela Bassett]]); cargo specialist Bernie ([[Eric Da Re]]); and young engineer apprentice Ethan (Paul Whitthorne), who anxiously anticipates seeing his father back on Earth. While Rick and Bernie bully Ethan, Fran and Albert show him more appreciation.  After examining the pod, Ethan discovers the emblem of the old Intergalactic Council on the side and questions the legality of claiming it for salvage. After reporting their find, the ship gets a communication from Councilor Tetra ([[Terrance Mann]]), of TerraCor, who offers Rick three times the going rate if he brings the pod to a nearby station. Fran, Bernie and Albert encourage Rick to accept the deal, but Ethan disputes going off course as it will delay his trip home.  Eventually, the crew decides to go to the station, but find the facility abandoned and a barely kept running by a malfunctioning central computer named "Angela" that will not obey orders unless given the exact opposite instruction. Matters are more problematic when Albert learns the reactor is leaking radiation although he does not anticipate it becoming critical for a month or so. Rick has bigger plans and secretly decides to rip off the others and take the contents of the pod for himself.  Eventually, Ethan stumbles upon Rick tampering with the pod, and Rick offers to cut him into his scheme saying his plan will get them back to Earth sooner. When Ethan refuses to abandon the others, Rick knocks him unconscious with a fire extinguisher. Rick manages to open the pod and encounters an excited Charlie who quickly jumps out. Infuriated, Rick refuses to believe Charlie is the only thing in the pod and crawls inside for himself. There, he discovers the freshly hatched baby Critters who quickly attack and kill him.  Charlie tries to shoot the Critters with Rick's gun but the critters manage to run off. He then revives Ethan and goes off to pursue the Critters with the confused boy in tow. Eventually, they meet up with the rest of the crew and Charlie explains who he is and how he came to be in the pod. While the crew contemplates his wild story, Bernie departs refusing to believe that "man-eating furballs" are running loose on the station.  Ethan then uses a computer keycard he earlier found outside a research lab to access a report made by Dr. McCormick ([[Anne Ramsay]]), who reveals that she was conducting research on various alien organisms for use as a bioweapon. Unfortunately, her creations could not reproduce on their own and she requested finding a suitable organism capable of rapid reproduction. After realizing what has been going on aboard the station, Albert strongly suggests they all leave it immediately.  Meanwhile, Bernie sneaks into the station's pharmacy to steal drugs. The Critters sneak up on him and he becomes their next meal. After the others find his remains, Angela announces that the reactor will go critical within hours and starts sealing off sections of the station. Albert realizes the reactor was in far worse shape than he originally thought. The crew are then forced to crawl through tight service tunnels to reach their ship, during which they find a clutch of freshly laid Critter eggs and learn the Critters are breeding.  Unknown to the crew, the Critters have made their way to the ''Tesla'' and program the ship to head for the nearest inhabited planet – Earth. One Critter tells the other to "get the kids" while it preps the ship for take-off. Once the crew arrive, Albert hands Charlie the only weapon he has; an antique Colt revolver. Charlie wastes no time using it when they encounter the Critters on the ship, but his shots not only kill the Critters, but destroys the flight controls leaving the ship dead in the water.  While the crew attempt repairs, Ethan takes the gun to hunt down the last Critter himself. He finds the creature in the science lab using the equipment there to rapidly grow several baby Critters to full size. He then runs back to the ship to warn the others just as a Terracor ship carrying Tetra and his troopers arrives.  The surviving crew rush to meet Tetra, but finds the troopers pointing their weapons at them. Tetra demands the Critter eggs but Albert refuses to be threatened. Ethan arrives just as Tetra shoots and kills Albert. Tetra then knocks Fran to the deck while Charlie stands confounded that his old alien friend Ug has turned selfishly evil. Ug says "things change" and then orders his troops to go find the eggs.  Still unnoticed, Ethan runs back to the science lab and sets up a trap for Tetra's troopers. When they arrive he seals them inside with the pack of hungry critters. He then retrieves the Critter eggs from the tunnel and brings them back to Tetra while juggling them carelessly in the air. To Tetra's astonishment, Ethan purposely drops and breaks two of the eggs leaving one left. After Tetra threatens to kill Fran, Ethan tosses the last egg to distract him. Fran then notices the revolver hidden in Ethan's waistband and quickly strikes Tetra in the head with it, knocking him out.  Charlie and Fran then rush aboard Tetra's ship to prepare for take-off, but Ethan lingers to mourn over Albert's body. Suddenly, the last Critter appears and attacks him, but Ethan manages to flash freeze the Critter with a fuel hose. As Ethan recovers he finds Tetra pointing a gun at him. Charlie returns and points the revolver at Tetra who doubts that Charlie even has the guts to pull the trigger. Charlie utters, "Things change, Ug", and shoots Tetra in the head.  Angela then warns that the reactor will go critical in a matter of moments and the survivors rush aboard Tetra's ship to escape. As Angela counts down to detonation, the station suddenly explodes a few seconds early leaving Ethan to laugh at how stupid the computer was, and that it could not even correctly tell time.  With the critters now extinct, Charlie, Fran and Ethan depart on their continuing voyage to Earth and Charlie contemplates on how the future will look bright for him.

The Cutting Edge
 Kate Moseley is a world-class figure skater representing the United States in the pairs event at the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in Calgary. She has genuine talent, but years of being spoiled by her wealthy widower father Jack have made her all but impossible to work with.  Doug Dorsey is captain of the U.S. ice hockey team at the same Winter Olympics.  Just minutes before a game, he and Kate literally run into each other at the arena. During the game, Doug suffers a head injury that permanently damages his peripheral vision, costing him a shot in the NHL and forcing him to retire. During Kate's event, her partner drops her during their program, costing them a chance at the [[gold medal]].  While training for the [[1992 Winter Olympics]] over the next two years, Kate has driven away all potential skating partners with her attitude and perfectionism. Her coach, Anton Pamchenko, has to find a replacement, an outsider who doesn't know that Kate is spoiled and difficult. He tracks down Doug, who is back home in [[Minnesota]], working in a steel mill and as a carpenter on the side, living with his brother, and playing in a [[semi-professional|hockey bar league]]. Desperate for another chance at Olympic glory, Doug agrees to work as Kate's partner, even though he has macho contempt for figure skating.  Kate's snooty, primadonna behavior gets on his nerves immediately, and their first few practices do not go well as they antagonize one another. However, they develop a mutual respect as both strive to outdo one another in work ethic. As their relationship grows warmer, they learn to set aside their differences, becoming a pair to be reckoned with both on and off the ice.  Kate even boldly defends Doug to her former coach who patronizes and insults them, and Doug defends his unusual choice of sport to his own family and friends, whom he had expected would mock him. At the U.S. Nationals, despite strong performances in the short program and long program, they place third and their Olympic dreams are shattered. However, when one of the leading pairs falls during the competition, they advance to second place, earning their spot on the Olympic team.  Their potential is threatened, however, by their growing attraction to each other. Kate attempts to seduce Doug after a night of drunken celebration, revealing that she broke off her engagement to a wealthy financier. Usually a ladies' man, Doug uncharacteristically rebuffs her advances, fearing the possibility of regret and loss of respect for one another. When Kate discovers that Doug has bedded another woman almost immediately after leaving her to sleep off her intoxication, she becomes enraged. The temporary rift is set aside, however, as they attempt to train a risky skating move invented by Pamchenko, which will assure them a gold medal if they can pull it off without serious injury.  At the finals at the [[Albertville]] Olympics, they look to be one of the top pairs competing for the gold. Yet another argument threatens their chemistry on the ice, and in the process Doug and Kate both discover that Kate is the fallible partner after all. Before getting on the ice for their decisive performance, they realize they love each other and skate with a passion neither had shown before.  
Damage (1992 film)
  Dr. Stephen Fleming (Irons), a physician by training who has entered politics and become a government minister for the environment, leads a privileged life in [[London]] with his wife Ingrid (Richardson) and young daughter Sally (Gemma Clarke). Their adult son, Martyn (Graves), a rising young journalist, lives elsewhere in London. At a diplomatic reception, Stephen meets a young woman named Anna Barton (Binoche), the daughter of a British diplomat and Elizabeth Prideaux ([[Leslie Caron]]), her four-times married [[French people|French]] mother who "lives in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]]". Anna, who works in the arts and antiques department at [[Sotheby's]] auction house, introduces herself as a close friend of Martyn's but it is apparent that Stephen and Anna are instantly attracted to each other.  A short time later, Martyn brings Anna with him when he briefly drops by his parents' sumptuous home to introduce her to his family and reveals that they are romantically involved. The developing [[sexual tension]] between Stephen and Anna becomes increasingly clear at this brief meeting although Martyn and his mother seem oblivious to this.  Despite her relationship with Martyn, Anna arranges a tryst with Stephen at her small London town house. The following day, Martyn is appointed deputy political editor at his London-based national newspaper. Ingrid arranges a dinner to celebrate in London. While at dinner, Ingrid shows a distrust in Anna and asks her aggressive questions regarding her childhood. Anna mentions the loss of her brother who was a year older than her and committed [[suicide]] when he was 16. When Ingrid asks why he killed himself, Anna replies, "Love." After dinner, Martyn drops off Anna and Stephen follows them. Once he leaves, Stephen talks to Anna about how much he "wanted to touch her during dinner". They have sex on the floor and in the bed. It is in bed that Anna describes in detail the suicide of her one-year older brother at age 16 after he had expressed an [[incest]]uous desire for her, saying "he wanted me all to himself and not to grow up." She also says that damaged people are dangerous and she hates a possessive relationship with anyone.  Stephen's obsession with Anna deepens further and on a whim he leaves halfway through a two-day [[European Parliament]] conference in [[Brussels]] to travel by train to [[Paris]] where Anna is spending the weekend with Martyn. While Martyn sleeps in their hotel room, Stephen and Anna have public sex in broad daylight in a church's open doorway as the church bell peals in the background. Afterwards Stephen checks into a hotel across the street from Anna and Martyn's, spying on the couple through his window. By then his infatuation has reached a point where he desires to be with Anna permanently, even at the risk of destroying his relationship with his son and family. In a meeting in a London park, however, Anna dissuades Stephen from doing this, assuring him that as long as she is with Martyn he will always have access to her.  During a subsequent visit to Anna's home, Stephen finds that another man named Peter Wetzler ([[Peter Stormare]]) is already present and he tells Stephen that they are former lovers. A jealous Stephen initially assumes that Anna is cheating on him and, when Peter leaves, returns and confronts her. Anna denies being currently involved with Peter, and then recounts that she had  compulsively run to Peter and slept with him as a reaction to her brother's suicide, which she had witnessed. Stephen is placated by this explanation and the couple once again have sex.  The Flemings travel to Hartley, the country estate of Ingrid's father, Edward Lloyd (Bannen), a retired but still well connected senior politician who has acted as Stephen's political mentor, to celebrate Ingrid's birthday. It is there that Martyn announces his engagement to Anna, which visibly disturbs Stephen. That night, after Stephen receives oral sex from Anna, his daughter Sally observes him leaving Anna's room. After returning to London an anxious Stephen lies to Sally about what she saw, telling her that he was merely talking to Anna to try to "bring all the parties together" about the upcoming marriage because Ingrid was upset about it. Later the Flemings have an awkward lunch with Anna's mother, Elizabeth, who is discouraging about the marriage and notices the strained behavior between Anna and Stephen. She correctly deduces that they are having an affair and, during a car ride with Stephen back to her hotel, warns him to put an end to it.  Stephen initially complies and calls Anna to end their relationship. He tries to confess his misdeeds to both Martyn and Ingrid, but shies away from doing so both times. Stephen instead succumbs to temptation and phones Anna's home but hangs up saying nothing when Martyn (who is now living there with her) answers the phone. Anna then rents a small renovated flat and mails him the keys so they can meet there. She tells Stephen that she could not marry Martyn without being with him. They go to the flat at an appointed time and begin another raucous tryst, but Martyn — having discovered about the flat by chance — finds them in bed together. Stunned, he accidentally falls backwards over a stairway railing and plunges to his death. A devastated nude Stephen clutches Martyn's body while Anna silently leaves the scene.  Stephen's affair is exposed and becomes the subject of a [[media frenzy]], with a mob of reporters convening outside his house.

Now publicly disgraced, Stephen resigns both his government position (he was to be appointed secretary of state for health with a place in the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]) and his seat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. He meets Anna's mother at a hotel and finds that Anna is staying with her but they say nothing to each other as they meet for the last time. Stephen withdraws himself from public life and, leaving his wife and daughter, retires to a rented room in an unknown town in southern [[Europe]].

Stevens then witnesses his father getting shot and killed while robbing a liquor store. He swears that he will never end up like him.  In 1991, Stevens is a police officer. He is recruited by [[DEA]] Special Agent Gerald Carver to go undercover in Los Angeles, claiming that his criminal-like character traits will be more of a benefit undercover than they would serve him as a uniformed policeman. Stevens poses as drug dealer "John Hull" in order to infiltrate and work his way up the network of the West Coast's largest drug importer, Anton Gallegos and his uncle Hector Guzmán, a South American politician. Stevens relocates to a cheap hotel in L.A. and begins dealing cocaine.  One day, Stevens is arrested by the devoutly religious [[LAPD]] Narcotics Detective Taft and his corrupt partner Hernández, as he buys a kilogram in a set-up by Gallegos' low-level street supplier Eddie Dudley. At his arraignment, Stevens discovers that he bought baby laxative instead of cocaine and his case is dismissed. Stevens' self-appointed attorney David Jason, who is also a drug trafficker in Gallegos' network, rewards Stevens' silence with more cocaine and introduces Stevens to Felix Barbossa, the underboss to Gallegos. Felix kills Eddie when he finds out he's working with the LAPD and enlists Stevens as Eddie's replacement.  Stevens develops a romance with Betty McCutcheon, the manager of an art dealership which is a front to [[money laundering|launder]] Jason's drug money. When one of Stevens' dealers is murdered by a rival dealer, Stevens kills him and is awarded a partnership in Jason's new business: distribution of a synthetic chemical variant of cocaine.  Felix is a [[confidential informant]] working with Detective Hernández. Felix immediately gives up Stevens, Jason, and Betty, and wants Jason killed during the arrest because of his business venture. Carver knows about this, but refuses to interfere forcing Stevens to violate orders and stop it himself by exposing Felix, which results in a vengeful Jason killing him, while Betty reneges the drug business because of it with Stevens' protection.  Gallegos comes to meet with Jason and Stevens and informs them that they have inherited Felix's debts to him. Later that day, Stevens meets with Carver to tell him about his meeting with Gallegos. Instead Carver pulls a gun on Stevens and orders him to surrender his weapon and get in his car. Angrily, Stevens disarms Carver and forces him to admit that the [[State Department]] has decided to leave Gallegos alone because Guzmán may some day be useful as a political asset to them and Carver has decided to play along in exchange for career advancement. Stevens' disillusionment reaches its conclusion and he abandons his undercover status vowing to take down Gallegos and Guzmán alone.  Stevens and Jason learn that Gallegos is going to kill them anyway, so they kill him first and steal a van storing over a $100 million of Gallegos' cash. Jason and Stevens invite Guzmán to a shipyard and offer to return 80% of Gallegos' money if he agrees to invest the remaining 20% in their synthetic cocaine operation. Detective Taft, who has been tailing Stevens, interrupts the deal but is unable to arrest Guzmán because of his [[diplomatic immunity]]. Guzmán leaves. Taft orders Stevens to surrender, but is shot and killed by Jason. Stevens reveals himself as a police officer and attempts to arrest Jason, but is forced to kill him in self-defense.  Afterwards, Carver coerces Stevens into testifying in favor of him and the DEA in return for not charging Betty for money laundering. Stevens produces a videotape of the incriminating conversation with Guzmán at the shipyard during his testimony to the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Subcommittee]], ruining the State Department's intentions along with Guzmán and Carver's careers.

Dien Bien Phu (film)
 The movie follows the chronological events of the battle. Some of them are shown ''in situ'', from the heart of the battle, at [[Dien Bien Phu]], while others are reported by civilians at [[Hanoi]] city or by paratroopers at [[Hanoi]]'s civilian airport.  The Hanoi action is mostly focused on British-born American writer-reporter Howard Simpson ([[Donald Pleasence]]). Simpson's sources of confidential information include French Union military men (Patrick Catalifo, Eric Do), an [[Agence France Presse]] correspondent ([[Jean-François Balmer]]), an influential Vietnamese nationalist ([[Long Nguyen-Khac]]), a Chinese contrabander ([[Thé Anh]]) and a Eurasian opium dealer ([[Maïté Nahyr]]). Simpson sends scoop-worthy news to the [[San Francisco Chronicle]] daily newspaper, through a [[Hong Kong]]-based agency, in order to elude French military censorship that existed at the time in Hanoi and the rest of Indochina.  War scenes are seen through the eyes of several character [[archetype]]s illustrating [[human nature]]. At Dien Bien Phu, there were two kinds of men: the cowards and the brave. The first are mainly illustrated by the unnamed "Nam Yum rat" ([[Fathy Abdi]]); an example of the second type is the philosopher-friendly artillery Lieutenant ([[Maxime Leroux]]), who refuses to obey orders to retreat and eventually dies for the sake of honor. Since they are archetypes, these characters have no name. The main characters have fictitious names, but are members of real units, like the 5th Bawouan Vietnamese para Lieutenant Ky ([[Eric Do]]) or Captain de Kerveguen ([[Patrick Catalifo]])'s Foreign Legion company.  Schoendoerffer's movie contains autobiographic elements that sometimes appear in dialogues and is particularly illustrated by the military cameraman character. Actor Ludovic Schoendoerffer plays the role of a young Army Cinematographic Service cameraman using the same camera type as his father, Corporal Pierre Schoendoerffer, did in 1954.

Judith can't leave Lincoln as she has to bring him in, so Mark and Anne head to the office together. They are attacked by Mr. Static and Baby Oopsy Daisy. Mark fights back but Baby Oopsy Daisy kills Anne. Mark finally shoots Jack Attack's head off with Charneski's shotgun. Judith enters a dollhouse and is transported to the lair of a kid who reveals that he is a spirit of a demon who wants to become human. In order to do that, he has to impregnate a woman so that his soul can transfer into the woman's [[oocyte|egg]], where he has to eat the baby's soul and take over its shell. If the baby doesn't make it through the birth, he has to be buried like a seed, and once grown, he will start the process over again. The last time he was born was 66 years ago. The baby [[Stillbirth|didn't make it through the birth]] so he was buried underneath the warehouse, unable to get out until Hesse bled onto the area.  Lincoln escapes while Judith is in the dollhouse. He catches up to Mark and is about to kill him when Judith appears and shoots Lincoln. Suddenly, all of the toys around them come to life. The pair begin shooting them to death, including Baby Oopsy Daisy. Grizzly Teddy turns into a man-sized monster and chases after Judith. Judith becomes trapped and is about to shoot herself when a toy soldier helps her escape. However, Judith is caught by the demon, who ties her up on the pentagram. Mark is attacked by Grizzly Teddy but manages to kill the monster. The demon, now in the form of a man, is about to rape Judith but the toy soldier shoots it, cuts Judith free, and turns into a boy (William Thorne). The demon transforms back into his own kid form and the two kids begin fighting, explaining the war card game from Judith's dream. As the demon is about to kill the boy soldier, Judith stabs him with the boy soldier's sword and the demon is sent back to Hell. Before heading back to Heaven, the boy soldier reveals that he's the spirit of the son she's going to have. Judith reunites with Mark and the two wait for the doors of the warehouse to open and let them go.

Diggstown
 Gabriel Caine ([[James Woods]]), a [[confidence trick|con man]], is released from prison in Winfield, Georgia and immediately gets to work on his next scam. Caine and his partner, Fitz ([[Oliver Platt]]), travel to a small town not far from the prison: Diggstown, a city obsessed with boxing.  A mean-spirited man named John Gillon ([[Bruce Dern]]) owns almost all of Diggstown. He is feared by many but also respected because he was the former manager of Diggstown’s pride and joy, the once-famous [[Boxing|boxer]] Charles Macom Diggs, the man for whom the town is named.  Upon hearing a remark that Diggs once knocked out five fighters in one day, Fitz “drunkenly” says he knows of a fighter who could knock out any 10 in one day: Honey Roy Palmer. Gillon tries to take advantage of the situation and bets Fitz $100,000 that no one man can best ten Diggstown boxers in one day. Caine quickly volunteers to finance Fitz's bet and the con is on.  Caine seeks out an old buddy, Palmer ([[Louis Gossett Jr.]]), who is now a 48-year-old [[YMCA]] supervisor. After some initial reluctance, Palmer agrees to participate and starts to train for the fight. Caine and Gillon agree to various conditions of the bet, with “one day” being 24 full hours and “Diggstown fighters” being able to come from any surrounding area of Olivair County. A loan shark backs Caine's bet, with the understanding that his health and welfare will be riding on the outcome.  Caine discovers that Gillon’s treachery (and his bank account) goes deeper than Diggstown people know. As his manager, Gillon drugged Diggs during a fight so that Gillon could collect on the opponent’s long odds. Diggs suffered irreversible [[brain damage]] as a result. With help from his prison buddy Wolf's sister ([[Heather Graham]]), it is learned that Gillon has more than $1.5 million in assets. Caine tricks him into risking all of it. Now it is up to Honey Roy Palmer to defeat all 10 of Diggstown's men.  They begin with:  * Buck Holland, who is played by former Heavyweight Boxing Contender Rocky Pepeli who puts up a good fight, Palmer barely beats him. * Slim Busby, who like his brother, Hambone, has been bribed by Caine to take a dive. * Billy Hargrove (a young [[James Caviezel]]), who is easily beat. * Sam Lester (played by [[Roger Hewlett]]), who is secretly given a [[laxative]] before the fight and eventually runs from the ring. * Hambone Busby, who, like his brother, has been bribed to take a dive. Gillon, however, threatens to kill Hambone’s brother, Slim, unless he is victorious in the ring. Hambone fights a vicious fight, but is ultimately defeated. Slim is indeed found murdered.      Palmer is enraged. His next fight is with Sonny Hawkins, who is easily dispatched. Robby Gillon, the son of John Gillon, approaches the ring next, but then backs out under instructions from his father. His cowardice is regarded as a forfeit. Frank Mangrum officially loses to disqualification after kicking Palmer in the groin, then hitting the referee then gets knocked out by Palmer. Tank Miller, a gargantuan fighter, is next. He puts up a good fight, but a tiring Palmer eventually beats him.  That brings up Diggstown's best man, Hammerhead Hagan, the only fighter ever to actually beat Palmer during their professional careers. He is brought in as a surprise ringer. Gillon moved him in as a county resident just before the bet rules were established, meaning that Hagan can legally fight.  The bout is one-sided. Palmer looks done for, but he gets new motivation after seeing Diggs, who is sitting courtside, move his hand slightly (which he interprets as a show of support). Caine, not wanting to see his friend die, attempts to [[Submission (combat sports)|throw in the towel]], but Palmer catches it and throws it back. Palmer rallies to knock out his opponent.  Palmer, Caine and Fitz begin their celebration of this miraculous feat. They are cut short by Gillon, who notes that his son never entered the ring -– therefore, only nine fights have transpired. The true tenth fighter is then introduced: Minoso Torres, a tough-as-nails boxer who ruled the boxing underground in the prison from which Caine was recently released. No one has ever defeated him. Gillon admonishes Caine with: "Never try to hustle a hustler."  An exhausted Palmer is no match for Torres. But just when all looks lost, Caine whistles at Torres, gets his attention, straightens his tie and does a thumbs-down gesture (copying a move Gillon did earlier). Torres drops his gloves and invites Palmer to hit him, hitting the canvas, knocked out. Caine was expecting such a trick from Gillon and bribed Torres long ago for a moment like this.  Gillon has lost everything, leading Caine to correct him with an admonishment: "Actually, I believe it goes: Never con a con-man, especially one who's better than you are."  Calm at first, he snaps and pulls a gun. His son, Robby, tries to intervene and Gillon smacks him. Palmer then grabs Gillon and prepares to deck him. Instead, he turns to Hambone, claiming, "My hands hurt." Hambone gladly obliges and delivers Gillon a powerful knockout blow.  Caine congratulates Palmer: "What you did," he says, "couldn't be done."  To which Palmer replies, "Now, you motivate me".  
Dil Ka Kya Kasoor
 Shalini ([[Divya Bharti]]) is the only sister of a rich businessman, Rajesh Saxena, ([[Suresh Oberoi]]), who is a much older character in the movie, and more like a father figure. She falls in love with her classmate, Arun Kumar ([[Prithvi]]), after he performs a song which was authored by her under a pseudonym. But she doesn't tell Arun about this because he doesn't like her; he thinks Shalini is a spoiled rich girl; she had behaved thus a few times with him and some others. Without disclosing his own identity or purpose, he goes to meet Arun, only to find out that he is an orphan, is from an underprivileged background and is living in a hostel room, since he doesn't have a house of his own. Arun also rejects any help from Rajesh, as he would prefer to face the world on his own.  Rajesh tells Shalini that he will only arrange her marriage to Arun if he reaches a status in society comparable to theirs. Shalini knows that Arun is a good singer because he often sings at college functions. She tells her friend, Madhu, to use her money to start up a music/stage production company and indirectly encourages Arun to become a singer. She starts writing songs for Arun Kumar (without publishing them elsewhere), but still prefers to remain anonymous. Arun gets these songs from an editor, Mr. Verma, who tells him that these songs are written by a girl called Seema (who wishes to stay anonymous). Through her songs, Arun becomes popular and wealthy in a short duration and wants to express his gratitude by meeting her, but Mr. Verma maintains Seema's anonymity, allowing Arun to correspond via letters.  Finally, Shalini's brother is ready to get her married to (a very successful) Arun, and also announces his intention to Shalini. But they soon find out that Arun has married the principal's daughter, Meena (Sanam). The marriage was not the culmination of any romance, rather the apt thing to do when the principal, who was a mentor to Arun, suddenly expired, leaving his daughter behind.  Shalini then decides to remain unmarried for the rest of her life. Her health gradually deteriorates and she is hospitalized due to some serious disorders. Mr. Verma tells Arun that Seema is in the hospital and about to die. He goes to the hospital, only to find out that Seema is none other than Shalini. He tells her wife about Shalini and they go to hospital together, where Arun symbolically accepts Shalini as his wife (on being encouraged by Meena), but Shalini soon leaves the world. A daughter is born to the pregnant Meena, who's named Seema, in memory of Shalini.

Dragon Ball Z: Super Android 13!
 The film opens with the introduction showing the death of [[Dr. Gero]] at the hands of the [[Artificial Human 17|Androids 17]] and [[Artificial Human 18|18]] including the Red Ribbon Army, but also reveals that Gero previously copied his consciousness into an underground supercomputer, working on an alternate ultimate android.  Cutting to the present day, [[Goku]] is shopping with [[Gohan (Dragon Ball)|Gohan]] and [[Chi-Chi (Dragon Ball)|Chi-Chi]], while [[Krillin]], [[Master Roshi]], [[Oolong (Dragon Ball)|Oolong]] and [[Future Trunks]] wait for a beauty pageant. As Goku, Chi-Chi, Gohan and the gang eat in the restaurant on the shopping centre's top floor, two humanoid beings enter the city and begin causing mayhem. Oblivious to their surroundings, they head straight for the restaurant and attack Goku. Goku briefly fights them and realises that they are androids, since he cannot sense their energy. The humanoids introduce themselves as Androids 14 and 15 as Gohan, Krillin and Trunks join the fray. Goku requests that they take the battle elsewhere in order to avoid harming innocent people, and the androids accept, flying to an Arctic area.  Goku and Trunks take on the androids and manage to hold their own until an android wearing the Red Ribbon Army insignia appears. This android introduces himself as Android 13, and explains that Dr. Gero may be gone, but previously programmed his supercomputer to think that it is Gero himself to continue Gero's dream to killing Goku in revenge for defeating the Red Ribbon Army. [[Vegeta]] and [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] also show up to aid their friends. Goku, Vegeta and Trunks power up to their Super Saiyan forms. While Android 13 manages to hold the upper hand against both Goku and Piccolo, Trunks and Vegeta destroy Androids 14 and 15, and surround 13, ready to take him on at once. Irate, 13 proceeds to absorb 14 and 15's main cores into his own being and undergoes a hideous transformation into Super Android 13. With his new form, nobody is able to match 13, and he pummels Goku and the others about.  Seeing no other choice, Goku begins summoning energy for the Spirit Bomb while Piccolo and the others stall 13. 13 eventually gets wind of this and tries to stop Goku, but Piccolo holds him off just long enough for Goku to go Super Saiyan again and merge with the Spirit Bomb. 13 attacks, but Goku effortlessly punches through 13's stomach and sends him into the core of the Spirit Bomb, where he is obliterated. With 13's demise, the underground supercomputer shuts down for good.  Following 13's death, Krillin and Gohan are sent to the hospital. There everyone jokes about Krillin's attempt to help and Gohan's [[summer school]] (which Chi-Chi had previously been stressed about at the beginning of the film). Elsewhere, Piccolo and Vegeta sit back to back on an iceberg, isolated from the celebration.  
Dr. Giggles
  In the town of Moorehigh in 1957, the patients of Dr. Evan Rendell kept disappearing. After some investigation, the citizens of Moorehigh found that he and his son Evan Jr. (nicknamed "Dr. Giggles" for his hideous laugh), were ripping out patients' hearts—in an attempt to bring back the doctor's dead wife. The townspeople stoned Dr. Rendell to death, but Evan Jr. disappeared.  Thirty-five years later, Dr. Giggles escapes from a mental asylum, killing everyone in his path. In Moorehigh, 19-year-old Jennifer Campbell, her boyfriend Max Anderson, and their friends are planning their summer break. Jennifer, upset that her father is dating again shortly after her mother's death, is further angered when she is diagnosed with a heart condition and is forced to wear a heart monitor to determine if she needs surgery. Meanwhile, Dr. Giggles breaks into his father's abandoned office and starts going through the doctor's old files, gathering a list of names. He begins to stalk and kill several of the town's residents, including Jennifer's friends.  Jennifer comes home from a party, and deciding that she's had enough of her heart monitor, dumps it in a fish tank. Jennifer's father finds her heart monitor and goes to look for her, leaving his girlfriend Tamara behind to also be killed by Dr. Giggles. Jennifer returns to the party and sees Max kissing another girl. Distraught, she runs into a house of mirrors. Dr. Giggles sees Jennifer and notices that she has the same heart condition as his mother and goes after her. He follows and kills the other girl Max was kissing, but Jennifer sees him coming and manages to escape. Officers Magruder and Reitz find her and take her to the police station.  Through a flashback, Office Magruder explains to Reitz that he knows how Evan Jr. escaped the night that Dr. Rendell was killed. He was in the morgue where the bodies of Dr. Rendell and his dead wife were. He noticed the dead wife's body moving and then witnessed Evan Jr. cutting his way out of her with a scalpel. He realized that Evan Jr. escaped by cutting open his mother's corpse and sewing it shut with him in it. That experience has left Office Magruder an alcoholic and an insomniac.  Dr. Giggles makes his way to Jennifer's house and attacks her father. Officer Magruder goes to investigate Jennifer's house and finds her father there, lying in a pool of blood. Dr. Giggles mortally wounds Magruder who, recognizing him as Evan Jr., angrily shoots him in the side before dying. Reitz arrives soon after, finding his partner dead and Jennifer's father wounded, but alive. Meanwhile, Dr. Giggles returns to his hideout, performing surgery on himself to remove the bullet. He then kidnaps Jennifer and tells her that he plans to replace her "broken" heart with one of those he took from the bodies of her friends. Reitz and Max arrive to save her. Reitz puts up enough of a fight with Dr. Giggles that Max and Jennifer manage to escape. Dr. Giggles manages to kill Reitz, but is unable to escape before his father's house explodes apparently killing him.  Jennifer is taken to the hospital, where she is told that the traumatic events of the evening have damaged one of her heart valves, and she is going to need surgery to replace it. While she is being prepped, Dr. Giggles reappears, having survived the explosion, and is cutting a bloody path through the hospital staff to get to Jennifer. He chases her to a janitor's closet where she spills a bottle of cleaning fluid onto the floor and hits him with a pair of defibrillator paddles, electrocuting him. She finally kills him by stabbing him through the chest with two of his own instruments. Dr. Giggles then [[fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]], staring at the camera and asking, "Is there a doctor in the house?" before dying.  Recovering in the hospital, Jennifer is visited by Max and her also-recovering father.

Dragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler
 A few years prior, the tyrant [[Frieza]] destroyed the Planet Namek during his battle with the newly transformed [[Goku|Super Saiyan Goku]]. The peaceful Namekians found themselves without a home for months. Eventually they had a new planet created for them with the help of the [[Dragon Balls]]. For three years or so they lived in peace on their new planet. One day however, a strange metal planet began to absorb New Namek. The silver planet wrapped around New Namek, absorbing its energy. [[Dende (Dragon Ball)|Dende]], who is now the Earth's guardian, senses the plight of his people and calls Goku  for help.  Goku, [[Son Gohan|Gohan]], [[Kuririn|Krillin]], [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], [[Oolong (Dragon Ball)|Oolong]], [[Yajirobe]] and [[Muten-Rôshi|Master Roshi]] arrive and encounter an army of strange, large, silent robots. They soon learn, to their horror, that the mastermind behind the invasion is Cooler, Frieza's older brother, who Goku was thought to have been killed a few years earlier and who now plans to use the Namekians as biological fuel for his ship, the Big Gete Star. Goku fights Cooler alone, while the other Z-Fighters battle Cooler's robots.  At first the Z-Warriors have trouble penetrating the robots' armor, but Piccolo instructs them to concentrate their energy to one point, and doing so allows them to destroy a few of the robots. However, there are far too many to handle and all the warriors, except Piccolo, are captured along with a village of Namekians. Piccolo is left behind, and destroys all the robots. He then makes his way to rescue those who were captured.  Elsewhere, it becomes apparent that Goku is no match for Cooler's new metallic form which gives him the ability to regenerate himself. Cooler also reveals his ability to use the Instantaneous Movement technique, which Goku also uses. Goku continues to struggle even after becoming a Super Saiyan. Cooler reveals that the Big Gete Star constantly monitors his body, and fixes any damage it might incur, in this case Cooler's arm being torn off by Goku.  Just before Goku is choked to death by Cooler, [[Vegeta]], who had arrived in a separate pod, shows up just in time to help Goku. The two Super Saiyans attack Cooler and they soon are able to kill him. However, the Big Gete Star now recreates not just one, but a thousand physical manifestations of Cooler's consciousness, tipping the balance of power decisively against the Saiyans. Outnumbered and exhausted, Goku and Vegeta are captured and transported to the spaceship's core to be used as energy.  As Cooler is leeching their Saiyan strength via strange wires, he snidely explains his manner of survival: not long after his defeat at Goku's hands, a nearby computer chip floated among a debris of spacecraft until it gained sentience and absorbed everything in its proximity and formed a spaceship. At one point, Cooler's remains, including pieces of his brain, were fused with the main computer allowing him to subsequently take control, effectively ''becoming'' the Big Gete Star. Goku and Vegeta regain consciousness and release all their Super Saiyan energy to the wires, overloading the system. They then come face to face with the supercomputer's core, the true Cooler. Cooler attempts to crush Goku, but his hand is severed by Vegeta, giving Goku enough time to blast him with the last of his energy, causing the android's ultimate demise. Meanwhile, Piccolo arrives in the fortress, and meets up with a clone of Cooler, which explodes. Eventually, all the other clones of Cooler and every other robot explode. Piccolo and the rest escape before the Big Gete Star leaves New Namek's orbit and explodes.  Goku and Vegeta fall from the sky near the rest of the Z-Fighters, and everyone rejoices. Vegeta is nowhere to be found, but Goku still compliments him for his role in defeating Cooler. Vegeta is shown in his spacepod holding the computer chip that created the Big Gete Star. He then crushes it, ensuring that it will never create another monstrosity like Meta-Cooler ever again.

Meanwhile, Mukurob receives a call about Saarke's house and drives to investigate with his superior, Capt. Beyman ([[William Hootkins]]). Mukurob visits Dr. Leidzinger ([[Marianne Sägebrecht]]), who tells him that the incident may be a part of a strange witchcraft ritual.  Wendy runs her car off the road and finds an abandoned camper (which Dust Devil had hitched a ride with at Bethanie) with a strange man, who she asks to help her push her car out of the sand. She then sees Dust Devil on the side of the road, and stops for him. Cpl. Dutoit ([[Russell Copley]]) and Cpl. Bates ([[Andre Odendaal]]) find the abandoned camper with dismembered body parts inside. Mukurob drives to Joe's home, the former Bethanie cinema, and asks him about the symbols that were in the house. He responds that it was the work of magic, to which Mukurob scoffs. Wendy and Dust Devil continue driving and pass another hitch-hiker, but Dust Devil tells Wendy not to stop. As they pass the hitch-hiker, Dust Devil disappears from the car.  Beyman tells Mukurob that he has to take him off the case and hand it over to the U.N., but says that he can give any information to him. Wendy stops at a small motel for the night and tries to cut her wrists, as Dust Devil waits with a razor outside the bathroom door, but Wendy does not commit suicide. She goes to her car the next morning and finds Dust Devil inside, who tells her that she was asleep the day before.  Meanwhile, Beyman gives Mukurob a pile of documented murders similar to the one he is following. Wendy and Dust Devil reach the [[Fish River Canyon]] as Wendy's husband Mark, arrives in Namibia. Mukurob has another of his recurring nightmares and is visited by Joe, who tells him to go with him. Mark arrives in Bethanie and asks about Wendy, but is beaten up by some of the people at the bar. Joe takes Mukurob to a small mountain cave and tells him that the murders are the work of the "naghtloper", a shape-shifting demon who gains power over the material world through ritual murder. Joe explains that the naghtloper must keep moving to work the ritual, but if he is tricked to step over a [[knobkierie|kierie stick]], he will be bound to one spot and his power can be taken. Joe then gives Mukurob a kierie and a sacred root to burn to prevent the naghtloper from possessing him after it is killed.  Wendy discovers human fingers among Dust Devil's belongings and he tries to kill her, but Wendy knocks him out and escapes. Dust Devil then chases her and causes her car to crash, forcing Wendy to run across the desert. Meanwhile, Mukurob releases Mark from prison and together they search for Wendy. As they try to drive through a dust storm, Dust Devil attacks them, causing the car to flip over. Mukurob handcuffs Mark to the car and heads into the storm, telling him that he has a chance since the naghtloper only takes those who have nothing to live for. Wendy reaches the abandoned town of [[Kolmanskop]] where Mukurob finds her and searches for Dust Devil. He runs into Dust Devil, who stabs him. Wendy then finds Dust Devil and tries to shoot him but the gun jams. As Dust Devil walks toward her, Mukurob takes the kierie and puts it in front of Dust Devil as he steps forward. Wendy picks up Mukurob's shotgun and kills Dust Devil as he says, "I love you, Wendy". Wendy then walks into the desert past Mark and the car, lies on the road and pulls over a fleet of army [[Casspir]]s.  The film ends with Joe saying, "The desert knows her name now, he has stolen both her eyes. When she looks into a mirror, she will see his spirit like a shawl blowing tatters around her shoulders in a haze. And beyond the dim horizon, a tapestry unfolding of the avenues of evil, and all of history set ablaze."

She also takes on several other women and a few rich men, who go through the same type of "sexual therapy" to become better lovers in the real world - for a very heavy price.  To help her friend to overcome her trauma, Emmanuelle puts her into several simulations. In the first one, she could have her first sex without the nun spashing water; the second one, she could have sex with Emmanuelle with the dormitory girls watching them; at the third, she could get revenge on the man that raped her; and on the fourth, she walks naked at a male [[bathhouse]] among several naked men so she could seduce as many as possible until she could perform a [[double penetration|sandwich]] sex. That helped her regain affection with men again.

Her boyfriend, Matt Wilson, is a stereotypical athlete and school bully who is constantly responsible for making both Dave and Stoney the objects of ridicule by humiliating them in various ways, usually directly due to Dave's growing affections toward Robyn.  One day, as Dave is digging a pool in his backyard, he comes across a chunk of ice that has the body of a man in it following an earthquake. They leave the ice block unattended in the garage and space heaters left on cause the ice to melt, releasing the caveman from the opening of the film.

Dave and Robyn make up, and the three boys lead the entire prom in an impromptu caveman like dance.  After the prom, the students attend Dave's house for a pool party where Dave and Robyn kiss. Meanwhile, Stoney and Link follow clues similar to when they found him ranging from breast prints on the slider and paint covering the walls.

At the birthday party, Bud's high school sweetheart and now sister-in-law, P.J., invites Bud out for a walk, which is met with curious suspicion by Bud's father, Speck. P.J. confesses she has sex with Speck, which is met with shock and disapproval by Bud.  Speck, a successful poultry farmer, is shown early on to be a chauvinistic and dominating womanizer. He fathered an illegitimate son but his wife, Marian, stayed with him. Speck refers to himself as a sire and the women who bore his children as fillies. Over time he is revealed to be dominating, violent, exploitive and shameless, to the point of even making a pass at Bud's wife.  Bud and Alice seem to have a good marriage, and she is clearly very devoted. But after learning of P.J.'s affair with Speck, Bud has sex with P.J. as well. P.J. seems to view her sexual encounters as conquests and take pride in simultaneously having three Parks men as lovers. She also seems to view her promiscuity, and the need to keep it secret, as a source of excitement for a housewife and mother who resides in what she considers to be a boring town.  The three days turn into several weeks. Bud's feelings of both love and lust for P.J. are rekindled, and he neglects Alice. Already disillusioned by the music business and thinking about leaving it, he realizes that he's a small-town man at heart and wants to stay in Doak City, where many of his relatives still reside. His anger toward his father also escalates.  California-bred Alice continues to love her husband but quickly becomes tired of small town life and his neglect. She accuses Bud of committing adultery. He doesn't deny it and she leaves with Terri Jo.  Bud tries to get P.J. back as the woman of his life. She reveals that she wanted that many years earlier, but that he wouldn't make a commitment, and it's too late now.  Frustrated and angry, Bud confronts Speck in a restaurant. Speck shows no interest or sympathy in his son's problems but expresses displeasure in having received none of the millions of dollars Bud has made in music. On the basis that he "sired" Bud, Speck claims to be entitled to some of Bud's money. Bud warns Speck to make no further sexual advances at Alice and, in a rage, knocks the food and tableware off the table. As Bud gets up to leave, he is viciously beaten by Speck.  Feeling like he's hit rock bottom, Bud gets drunk and performs a stunt from his wild youth. He lies in a cage in the back of a pickup truck and has one of his friends push the cage onto the road while the truck is moving. He wakes up lying in a hospital bed wearing a brace on his neck and a cast on his right arm. Standing beside his bed are P.J., his sister Sally Cutler and his paternal grandmother.  Alice returns and seems willing to take Bud back if he will be honest with her. Having been rejected by P.J. and humbled by his father and the accident, Bud now realizes what's most important in his life. He and Alice reconcile.

Far and Away
   In Ireland in 1892, Joseph Donnelly's family home is burned down by his landlord's men because of unpaid rent. Joseph's father just died and made a promise to his father that he will run his own land someday. Joseph unsuccessfully attempts to kill the landlord, Mr. Christie. Instead Joseph injures himself, and Mrs. Christie and their daughter Shannon nurse him back to health with the intent of hanging him. Joseph meets Shannon, who rebels against family tradition and plans to run away from home, board a ship, and claim free land in America. She offers to take Joseph with her as her servant so she, a single woman, can travel without scandal. Joseph doesn't believe her and refuses to travel with Shannon.  Joseph plans to duel Christie's foreman, Stephen Chase-- he is the man who set fire to the Donnelly family home. Christie meets Joseph before the duel, and tells him that he had nothing do with Joseph's family's eviction or that of any of the other tenant farmers, since the land is managed by Chase. The duel begins, and Chase is very close to shooting Joseph, but Shannon dashes in with her horse and buggy, rescuing Joseph at the last moment.  Together on a ship bound for America, Shannon meets Mr. McGuire, who tells her and Joseph about America's arable free land in [[Oklahoma Territory|Oklahoma]], informing them that once they get to America, they must head out by train to Oklahoma and race  everyone else for a claim to stake. Shannon divulges that her collection of valuable silver spoons will cover all expenses to get the pair to Oklahoma, and McGuire offers to help her find a shop to sell them to once they arrive in America.  On arriving in [[Boston]], McGuire is shot, and Shannon's spoons fall out of his clothing and get snatched up by passersby. Joseph rescues her, but not the spoons. Soon the two immigrants are introduced to Mike Kelly, a Boston ward boss, and an Irish-American himself. Kelly finds Joseph and Shannon jobs, and a room to rent in a brothel, which they must share. To avoid scandal, Joseph says Shannon is his sister. Because they are working-class people, it would be dangerous for their fellow Irish immigrants to find out about her privileged background.  As the pair continues to share a room, Joseph and Shannon become attracted to each other, but both keep up a front of indifference. One night, Joseph rushes out to Boss Kelly's club, where a [[bare-knuckle boxing]] match is underway. Joseph challenges the winner, knocks him out, and soon becomes a regular at the club to make extra cash while both he and Shannon work in a chicken-plucking plant.  Back in Ireland, the Christies' house is burned down by angry tenants in the [[Land War|Irish Land War]], so the Christies decide to emigrate to America, hoping also to find their daughter.  Meanwhile Joseph discovers that Shannon has gone to Kelly's club. He discovers Shannon on stage as a [[American burlesque|burlesque]] dancer. He tries to cover her with his jacket, demanding that she stop dancing. The Irish men surrounding the couple beg him to fight and offer him a small fortune ($200). Shannon, who previously scorned boxing, urges him to fight, since the money would get them to Oklahoma. Joseph agrees and is winning until he notices one of his backers (a member of the city council) groping Shannon, who is sitting on his lap. Joseph pushes through the crowd to free her, but is pushed back into the ring, where his foot accidentally "toes" the line, but he isn't ready and his opponent lands a [[sucker punch]], after which Joseph is defeated.  In retaliation for the hundreds of dollars Joseph's boxing loss has cost Boss Kelly and his friends, Joseph is thrown out of Kelly's club. Joseph meets a policeman who shows him a photograph of Shannon, asking if he's seen her. Joseph returns to their room in the brothel to find Kelly and his thugs searching their room for the money he and Shannon saved. Kelly takes their money, and Joseph and Shannon are thrown out into the streets, homeless.  Cold and famished, the pair enter a seemingly abandoned and luxurious house. Joseph encourages Shannon to pretend the house is hers and he is her servant, but she begs him to pretend they are married and the house is theirs. During that tender moment, the owners of the house return and chase them away, shooting Shannon in the back. Joseph, who knows the Christies are looking for her in Boston, brings Shannon to the home where they're staying. He decides Shannon will be better cared for by them, and leaves, despite his obvious feelings for her.  Joseph heads west to the [[Ozarks]]. He finds work laying train track, seemingly abandoning his dream of owning land. He sees a wagon train out the door of his boxcar. Knowing it is headed for the Oklahoma land rush, Joseph abandons the railroad and joins the wagon train, arriving in Oklahoma Territory just in time for the [[Land Run of 1893]].  Joseph finds Shannon, Chase, and the Christies already in Oklahoma. Chase, having seen Joseph talking to Shannon, threatens to kill him if he goes near Shannon again. Joseph buys a horse for the land rush, but the horse dies in a few hours, and he is forced to ride an unruly horse he manages to tame. He discovers that Chase has cheated by illegally inspecting the territory before the race, and is headed for the extremely desirable land he found. On this other horse, Joseph quickly outpaces everybody and catches up with Shannon and Chase.  Joseph is ready to plant his claim flag, but Chase rushes on horseback at Joseph. A fight breaks out, with Joseph falling and crushed by the horse. Shannon runs to his side and rejects Chase when he questions her actions. Joseph professes his love for Shannon. Joseph passed out a little and was revived. They both drive the land stake into the ground and claim their prize land before the other settlers get there.  
FernGully: The Last Rainforest
  Crysta is a [[fairy]] with a curious nature living in FernGully, a pristine rainforest free from human intervention. The fairies of FernGully once lived in harmony with humans, but believe them to have gone extinct after having been driven away by a dark spirit named Hexxus. Crysta is the apprentice of Magi, a motherly-figure fairy who imprisoned Hexxus in a tree. One day Crysta explores a new part of the forest and meets Batty, a [[Megabat|bat]] who claims to have been experimented on by humans, giving him a cocky and unstable personality. However, fairies refuse to believe him, except for Crysta, who volunteers to investigate the situation. She sees Zak, a young lumberjack whom Crysta accidentally shrinks when she tries to save him from being crushed by a falling tree, though does not know how to restore him to normal size.  The tree that Hexxus is imprisoned in is cut down by Tony and Ralph, Zak's superiors. Hexxus quickly begins to regain his powers by feeding on pollution. He manipulates the humans to drive to FernGully. In FernGully, Zak meets Pips, a fairy envious of Zak's relationship with Crysta. Zak begins to fall in love with Crysta, but hides the true reason that the humans had returned. When the signs of Hexxus's resurrection begin to manifest themselves in poisoned trees and rivers, he finally admits that humans are destroying the forest. The fairies mount an attempt to defend their homes, but knowing their fight is hopeless, Zak convinces Batty to aid him in stopping the machine before it destroys them. When Zak makes his presence known to Tony and Ralph, Hexxus takes over the machine and begins to wildly destroy the forest.  Magi sacrifices herself to give the fairies a chance, and she tells Crysta to remember everything she's learned. Zak manages to stop the machine, depriving Hexxus the source of his power, but he manifests himself within the oil in the machine and begins to ignite the forest ablaze. Crysta seemingly sacrifices herself by allowing herself to be devoured by Hexxus and all seems lost, until he begins to sprout limbs and leaves like a tree. Pips and the rest of the fairies rally to the powers they have been given, which causes the seed that Crysta fed him to start growing wildly. Hexxus is imprisoned by the newly grown tree at the very border of FernGully which bursts into bloom. Crysta appears after the fight, having survived her ordeal and successfully succeeded Magi as a magical fairy. She gives Zak a seed, begging him to remember everything that has transpired and she sadly restores him to his human size. Remembering the seed in his hand, Zak promises to remember his adventure, and buries the seed in the soil before telling Tony and Ralph that things need to change as they leave the forest behind. The seed sprouts new growth for FernGully, as Crysta follows Pips with Batty behind her.

The Favour, the Watch and the Very Big Fish
 Louis Aubinar ([[Bob Hoskins]]), a humble, middle-aged photographer, specializes in religious pictures. Louis lives in a small apartment in Paris with his psychotic sister, Elizabeth, who cooks terrible meals, including grinding an entire [[sailfish]] into paste. His employer, Norbert, a prestigious religious articles curator, has commissioned a series of portraits of the Saints. Norbert decides to discard their next project, [[John the Baptist]], and move directly to [[Jesus]]. Louis, who is already cash-strapped, faces the prospect of being fired if he does not find an appropriate model for Jesus. Louis' friend Zalman is also worried, as he was supposed to have posed as John the Baptist for the cancelled photo, and now his flu will interfere with another job in film-dubbing that he counts on keeping. He asks Louis to do him a favour and cover his part until he's well.  In spite of his terrible situation, Louis agrees and goes to Zalman's job, which turns out to be voice dubbing for [[pornographic film]]s. In shock, he takes his place near Sybil ([[Natasha Richardson]]). Dazed and traumatized, he inadvertently has a loud, intense [[orgasm]], impressing Sybil. They [[meet cute]], and Louis introduces himself as Zalman, to cover his friend's absence.  Sybil tells Louis the story of her last unfortunate relationship with a passionate but delusional Pianist ([[Jeff Goldblum]]), who worked in the same restaurant as she did. A girl having her birthday party at the restaurant offered Sybil a watch, so that Sybil would make the Pianist smile while he played. They become close, and their passion improves his playing, and by consequence the reputation of the restaurant. A Violinist begins playing at the restaurant, also performing passionately, and is attacked by the Pianist in a jealous rage which landed him in prison for three years, due to be released the next day.  Louis, moved by Sybil's story, lends her money to buy a suit for the Pianist, and promises to be there with her at the prison gates. Sybil's sickly grandfather has a complication that makes Sybil miss their meeting at the prison gates, so Louis follows the wrong person. Later he is confused when he sees the suit returned to the shop's window. By a stroke of fate, the Pianist finds Norbert's card and arrives there in a downpour of rain. Louis finds the Pianist is the perfect model for Jesus, and helps him obtain a very well-paying contract from Norbert.  Louis is taking the best pictures of his career with the Pianist (who gives various names to himself, including [[Frédéric Chopin]]) as Jesus. However, life is becoming complicated for the Pianist; he is being identified as Jesus by the public that has seen his posters. By another stroke of fate, he is forced to try to cure a blind boy and, during his pretended concentration, a golf ball hits the boy on the head and the boy's sight is restored. Doubting his own identity, the Pianist starts believing that he is Jesus. Through friendly conversations with Louis, he also starts understanding that Louis is disclosing to him his feelings for the same Sybil from the Pianist's past.  Meanwhile, Sybil had returned the suit to the store and returns the borrowed money to the real Zalman, who happens to be too sick to open the door. Still trying to locate Louis, who she thinks is Zalman, she arrives at Norbert's, from where the Pianist has recently been fired. As the Pianist sees Sybil talking to Norbert, he attacks Louis. Louis is caught off guard, as he is still completely unaware of the Pianist's former relation with Sybil.  Finally, the Pianist believing himself to be Jesus tries to walk on water and drowns in a river. Louis, still confused, is carrying his ashes in an urn when Sybil finally finds him. The film ends with the two of them getting close to each other again. At the very end, Sybil, who still believes that Louis is Zalman, notices that he is wearing the very watch that she was once given.  
Das Fest des Huhnes
 The morals and customs of the "native peoples" of [[Upper Austria]] are described by a team of [[anthropology|anthropologists]] from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] in the style of [[Europe]]an and [[The Americas|American]] anthropologists in the non-[[western world]].  While making the film, they discover new cultural phenomena.  Wippersberg turns around the research methodology of Western anthropologists of performing ethnologic studies, and then popularising them by means of a [[documentary film]].  The name of the film derives from the discovery that the researchers made, that the churches were vacated, but the locals instead tend to gather in large tents, and drink a [[beer|yellowish fluid]] by the litre, while primarily eating [[chicken]] and then engaging in a [[chicken dance]].  The researchers come to the conclusion that the chicken has taken the religious-sacrificial role of the [[domestic sheep|lamb]].  
A Few Good Men
  U.S. Marines [[Lance corporal#Marine Corps|Lance Corporal]] Harold Dawson and [[Private first class#United States Marine Corps|Private]] Louden Downey are facing a general [[Courts-martial in the United States|court-martial]], accused of killing fellow Marine Private William Santiago at the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] in Cuba. Santiago had poor relations with his fellow Marines, compared unfavorably to them, and broke the [[chain of command]] in an attempt to get transferred out of Guantanamo. Base Commander [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Nathan Jessup and his officers argue about the best course of action: while Jessup's executive officer, [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Matthew Markinson, advocates that Santiago be transferred, Jessup dismisses the option and orders Santiago's commanding officer, [[First lieutenant#U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force|Lieutenant]] Jonathan James Kendrick, to 'train' Santiago to become a better Marine.  [[United States Navy|Naval]] investigator and lawyer [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant commander]] JoAnne Galloway suspects Dawson and Downey carried out a "code red": a violent [[extrajudicial punishment]]. Galloway wants to defend them, but the case is given to [[Lieutenant (junior grade)]] Daniel Kaffee, an inexperienced and unenthusiastic lawyer with a penchant for plea bargains. Initially, friction exists between Galloway, who resents Kaffee's apparent laziness, and Kaffee, who resents Galloway's interference. Kaffee negotiates a plea bargain with the prosecutor, Captain Jack Ross (USMC); insisting Kendrick gave the "code red" order minutes after he had publicly ordered the platoon not to touch Santiago, and never intending their victim to die, Dawson and Downey refuse the deal. Dawson shows outright contempt for Kaffee's 'cowardice', even refusing to salute. Kaffee meets with Jessup, who tells Kaffee that Santiago was set to be transferred.  Galloway convinces Kaffee to take the case to court; the defense establishes the existence of "code red" orders at Guantanamo, and that Dawson specifically had learned not to disobey any order after a promotion was denied for helping out a Marine who was under what could be seen as a "code red". However, they suffer two major setbacks: Downey, under cross-examination, reveals he was not actually present when Dawson received the supposed "code red" order, and Markinson, ashamed that he failed to protect a Marine under his command, tells Kaffee that Jessup never ordered the transfer, but commits suicide rather than testify.  Without Markinson's testimony, Kaffee believes the case lost, lamenting that he fought the case instead of taking a deal. Galloway convinces Kaffee to call Jessup as a witness, despite the risk of a court-martial for smearing a high-ranking officer. Jessup spars evenly with Kaffee's questioning, but is unnerved when Kaffee points out a contradiction in his testimony: Jessup stated Marines never disobey orders and that Santiago was to be transferred off-base for his own safety, but, having ordered his men to leave Santiago alone, then Santiago was in no danger. Irate at being caught in a lie and disgusted by what he sees as Kaffee's impudence towards the Marines, Jessup extols the military's importance, and his own, to national security. When asked point-blank if he ordered the "code red", he bellows with contempt that he did; Jessup tries to justify the order as he is arrested, and Kendrick is later arrested for his part.  Dawson and Downey are cleared of the murder charge, but found guilty of "[[Conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman|conduct unbecoming]] a United States Marine" and are [[dishonorable discharge|dishonorably discharged]]. Dawson accepts the verdict, but Downey does not understand what they did wrong. Dawson explains they had failed to stand up for those too weak to fight for themselves, like Santiago. As the two are leaving, Kaffee tells Dawson honor doesn't come from a patch on his arm. Dawson stands at attention, recognizing him as an officer and rendering a salute.

For a Lost Soldier
 Jeroen ([[Jeroen Krabbé]]) reminisces about the time in 1944 when he ([[Maarten Smit]]) and other boys were sent to the countryside by their parents to escape the war. The city suffers from food shortages, with more food available in the country. He stays with an [[eel]] fisher's family, but despite the abundance of food, he is plagued by homesickness. Jeroen and his friend Jan go to the ocean and see an American plane in the water; Jan tries to go under but claims there are too many eels and comes up with a big cut on his upper right thigh.  Things change when the village is liberated by [[Canadians|Canadian]] troops. Jeroen meets Walt Cook ([[Andrew Kelley]]), a Canadian soldier in his early 20s, who befriends him. Walt at first treats Jeroen like a little brother, and the boy revels in the attention the soldier showers on him. Eventually, however, their relationship becomes sexual. They also engage in friendly, platonic activities, with Jeroen driving Walt's jeep and cleaning his guns. Jeroen's [[foster home|foster parents]] are aware of the closeness between the boy and Walt, but it is left ambiguous whether they are aware of the sexual nature of the relationship.  After a few more days, Walt's troops are ordered to move and Walt leaves without saying goodbye to Jeroen. Jeroen hears about it from his foster sisters that they are leaving and he rushes to the soldiers' home, but finds that they have already left. (The film suggests that Walt attempts to tell Jeroen's foster father the prior evening that the troops would be leaving, but gives up when the language barrier becomes obvious.) Jeroen searches throughout town, unable to find any trace of Walt, and is further devastated when he returns home and sees that the shirt where he had stored a photo of Walt was on a clothesline in the rain, ruining the photo. Later that night, Jeroen is lying awake in his bed and notices Walt's dog tag on a scarecrow that had posed as "Walt" in a photo with his foster family, and races outside to grab the tag. However, Jeroen touches pigeon wire on the scarecrow and badly hurts his hand. He collapses in tears, clearly heartbroken, and is taken inside by his foster father. The next morning, his foster father notices the sunglasses that Walt left on the wire while burning the scarecrow. After the war is over, Jeroen returns to his family back in [[Amsterdam]], where he decides to go to [[United States|America]] later in his life.  The film ends with grown-up Jeroen affectionately recalling the story and trying to express it as a [[ballet]] dance. While rehearsing the dance, his assistant hands him an envelope. He opens the envelope to find an enlargement of the only photo of him and the foster family and also a further enlargement of the soldier's dog tag with his identification. He realizes that he can now find his lost soldier after all this time.  
Folks!
 The film tells the story of Jon Aldrich ([[Tom Selleck]]), a successful stockbroker who is living a good life with a wife and kids until he comes across his elderly father who has major [[dementia]] and, as a result of it, wreaks all kinds of havoc on his life including his own, which among all of them involves accidentally burning down his own house. Jon tries to get his sister, Arlene ([[Christine Ebersole]]) (who has two sons of her own but is an irresponsible gold digger), to take care of their parents, but she won't even open the door. As a result, his father, Harry ([[Don Ameche]]), and his mother, Mildred ([[Anne Jackson]]), have to move in with him and his family. That is the moment that his good life starts going downhill.  The company Jon works for was apparently doing illegal things which he knew nothing of, but no one believes him therefore he loses his job. The problems for him continue to mount up as Harry continues to cause all kinds of trouble and, as a result of it, the family becomes broke. His wife, Audrey ([[Wendy Crewson]]), moves out with the kids, and they lose everything except their apartment. Furthermore, as a result of his severe senility, Harry continues to unintentionally injure Jon, causing him to get hearing loss, a broken hand, and a broken foot when a car runs over it. He also loses a testicle. Plus, Harry puts the lives of Jon's kids and himself in danger at one point by jaywalking in an intersection one morning while trying to take them for a walk with him without letting anyone know.  As a result of the whole mess, Jon slowly starts to lose his own sanity, but in a brief moment of regaining his own Harry tells him that he never wanted to be a burden on him but he soon slips back into his state of dementia, where he is just happy all the time and often yells out "[[McDonald's]]". Jon talks with Mildred who also says that she and Harry never wanted to be a burden on him. She then tells him that they have discussed it, and they want him to help them die so he can collect the insurance money. He is totally against this at first but after a while he changes his tune.  Somehow ending up agreeing to volunteer to it, Jon helps his parents try to commit suicide many unsuccessful times and halfway through the attempts Arlene shows up on his doorstep with both of her corpulent sons in need of a place to live. He refuses at first because she would not even open the door for them but he eventually caves in and lets them stay. She also joins in on the attempts to help their parents die, hoping for a cut of the insurance money. Her attempts are also unsuccessful.  Things slowly start looking up for Jon as Audrey eventually shows up to tell him that she was wrong for leaving and how much she loves the fact that he was willing to take in both of his parents. Upon her arrival she realizes all the injuries he has suffered since she saw him last, including the missing testicle. As they are reconciling he realizes that Arlene and his parents are gone and he knows they are going to try to commit suicide again with her help, so he tracks them down in an attempt to stop them which he successfully does, but not without facing a bit more injury.  Jon eventually gets their lives on track. He and Audrey buy a house and his parents move in with them. Arlene is now with a man who knows how to handle her bad behaving children. At the end we finally find out that Harry hasn't been yelling "McDonald's" because he was hungry, but because he bought stock in [[McDonnell Douglas]] years and years ago, meaning he is worth tons of money.  
For Richer, for Poorer (film)
 Aram Katourian (Lemmon) is atop a bridge considering whether to jump to his death when a homeless woman ([[Madeline Kahn]]) -- fascinated by seeing a person die—interrupts him.

He married his greedy high school sweetheart Millie (Shire) and have an adult son, Michael (Silverman). When he is not spying on his staff, he spends his time with his mistress, Irene ([[Joanna Gleason]]).  Realizing that his son has no intention of building a career for himself, due to money always being available to him, Aram decides to sell his business and give all of his money away to random strangers on the street. He is enthusiastic when Michael assures him that their economical future will be just fine, but upset when he later finds out that Michael meant that he has no doubt that his father will find another job.  Millie stands by Aram's side and becomes a housekeeper to earn some money. Aram also takes on a few tasks, but Michael quits his job after the first twenty minutes due to a fight with his boss. Aram, fearing that he will never inspire his son to come off the couch from watching television, suddenly has a great idea: He and Michael will join forces to make travel videos. The business would combine Michael's love for TV and luxury travel. Aram soon finds his travel video concept already exists.  Seeing no other options, Aram purposely gets into a car accident to inspire Michael to feel some responsibility for the family. Michael promptly becomes engaged to a wealthy girlfriend from the past who has recently inherited all of her father's money. Aram, fed up with his son's spoiled behavior, confronts Michael with his lack of responsibility, ordering him to get out of his life.  With his son gone, and Millie working as a maid, Aram starts to regret his decisions. He tapes a video in which he admits that his bankruptcy was faked. He then goes to the bridge, where he runs into the homeless woman. Billie, who lives in poverty but is still optimistic about life, inspires Aram to not kill himself. They part ways after she admits that she was one of the people who Aram gave his money to.  Two years later, Millie, now owner of a bakery, is still upset by his abandonment when Aram contacts her. She reveals that she never accepted any of Michael's money, and instead contacted Irene (she knew about the affair) to open their own shop. Aram offers to end their marriage formally, though Millie remains suspicious.  Aram finds out that his son has recently divorced, but received a lot of money during the settlement. Michael nevertheless decided to work as a waiter to earn some honest money. Aram is initially disgusted by his son doing such a menial job, then feels proud when he learns about his motives. The family eventually reconciles, and Aram now lives off Michael's earnings.  
Forever (1992 film)
   
Freejack
 In 2009, the super-wealthy achieve immortality by hiring "bonejackers", mercenaries equipped with time travel devices, to snatch people from the past, just prior to the moment of their deaths, for use as substitute bodies. Those who escape are known as "freejacks" and are considered less than human under the law. In this [[dystopian]] future, most people suffer from poor physical health as a result of rampant drug use and environmental pollution, making them unattractive as replacement bodies.  Alex Furlong is a [[Formula One]] racer who is about to die in a spectacular 1991 crash when a time machine snatches him from the cockpit and into 21st century [[New York City]], now a futuristic dystopia populated by scavengers and killers. When Furlong's captors are ambushed by a hit squad, Furlong escapes from Victor Vacendak, a hardened mercenary who has snatched him on behalf of the powerful McCandless Corporation. Alex's former fiancée Julie Redlund is now an executive at McCandless, handling high-stakes mineral negotiations with a rival Japanese firm.  Alex spends much time escaping the clutches of Victor, a ruthless pursuer who nevertheless lives by a code of honor, and rekindling his relationship with Julie. Ian McCandless, Julie's boss, is revealed to have died and seeks to install his backed-up personality into Furlong's body. Besides evading Vacendak's army of mercenaries and McCandless police personnel, Alex and Julie also have to deal with fleeing from the private guards of McCandless's corporate X.O., Mark Michelette, who is gunning for McCandless's position. Alex finds he cannot trust his old friends from 1991, who are now eager to sell him out.  Tired of running, Furlong pretends to take Julie hostage and negotiates with Michelette to arrange a meeting, counting on Michelette's not knowing about their past relationship; however, Michelette has seen the footage of Julie's grief after Alex's 1991 accident. After she slaps him in return for his mockery, the couple flees. They are thwarted when they encounter a gunfight in the lobby between two factions, now in opposition: McCandless's security guards and Vacendak's mercenaries. Despite Julie's plan to leave the building through an "escape module" on the hundredth floor, the elevator takes them automatically to the complex at the very top of the building where McCandless's mind is in storage. In a [[virtual reality]] encounter with McCandless's essence, he explains his goal: to use Alex's body to satiate his love for Julie. Apologizing, he offers to die and let Alex run the company under the guise of being McCandless.  As they consider the offer, Vacendak arrives, and McCandless reveals he was merely stalling for time. Alex fights the process as Michelette stumbles in, wounded from fighting Vacendak's soldiers. In the confusion, Julie grabs the gun of the soldier holding her and fires off a shot that disrupts the transfer process. The results are inconclusive as to whether or not it is McCandless or Furlong in Alex's body now. The scientists cannot determine the answer, but Vacendak can, as only Vacendak knows a secret code McCandless gave him.  Alex reads the code, slowly, and Vacendak asks him to continue. Alex finishes the code quickly. Michelette tries to kill Alex but is gunned down by Vacendak's men. Alex remarks about how he feels in his "new" body, before telling Julie that she will be dressed more appropriately so that the two of them can take a drive. Hours later, after the coup is over, Julie and Alex get into one of McCandless's favorite vehicles; Alex tells the driver that he will do the driving today. Vacendak stops them as the car leaves the estate. It turns out that the transfer was not complete after all; Furlong got McCandless's secret number wrong, though Vacendak went along with it. He simply waited until Furlong made a mistake: McCandless did not know how to drive. Vacendak admonishes Julie that "you'll have to coach him better than that", then leaves while Furlong and Julie speed away.

Finley confides that his latest experiment, "Project B", has succeeded in doing the impossible. The machine, built by Finley and his team of scientists, is a prototype chamber for [[cryonic]] freezing. When McCormick's girlfriend, Helen ([[Isabel Glasser]]) goes into a coma from an accident and the doctors doubt she will ever recover, McCormick insists he be put in [[suspended animation]] for one year, starting November 26, 1939, so he will not have to watch Helen die.  Fifty-three years later, two boys are playing inside a military storage warehouse which is being emptied in preparation for its demolition. They discover the suspended animation chamber containing McCormick and are enticed by it. Believing it to be a miniature submarine, they proceed to play with its dials and controls and accidentally activate the restoration process. The chamber opens and McCormick reflexively grabs one boy's coat, causing them to flee in terror, leaving the coat clasped in McCormick's hand. Shortly after, McCormick awakens to the realization that it is now 1992. After appropriating shorts and a shirt from a clothesline, he first approaches the military about his experiences. When they dismiss him as crazed, McCormick becomes more determined to learn what happened to Finley, Helen, and the world that has seemingly evolved overnight around him.  An address tag inside the jacket leads McCormick to the owner, 10-year old Nat Cooper ([[Elijah Wood]]), one of the two boys who opened the chamber. Though the boys are initially terrified, McCormick is able to calm Nat and his friend with the truth of his story. While hiding in Nat's tree house with a secret stash of junk food, he witnesses Nat's single mother Claire ([[Jamie Lee Curtis]]) being assaulted by her abusive, alcoholic ex-boyfriend, and goes to her defense. After McCormick receives a gash in the fight, Claire, a nurse, fixes it up and a bond develops between the two. This bond is strengthened when she offers McCormick a place to stay, until he can discover what to do with his search. Nonetheless, McCormick's time is running out, as his body starts to age rapidly because the suspended animation chamber process was not entirely successful.  When another "aging attack" practically cripples McCormick, Claire is told the amazing truth. Susan, Finley's daughter, informs him that her father died many years earlier before she was born (the government later specifies it was a warehouse fire in the early '40s, while trying to save the frozen McCormick from the chaos). Susan also gives McCormick her father's journals, hoping he can use them to reverse his own condition. However, according to the journals, the subject did not properly stop aging, but rather postponed it, thus explaining Daniel's own rapid aging. Before leaving, Susan gives McCormick one further revelation: Helen is alive. The government is also after McCormick, but in the end, Claire hands over the crucial information on "Project B" and no one is arrested as the government investigates what went wrong. Claire gave the government the journals that Harry wrote, to help them to fix their problem. Claire notices Nat is gone and he was last in the plane with Daniel. The Government will wait for Nat and Daniel to get back and escort them back home, so they can finish their research on Harry's machine and research from the hospital on Daniel's condition too.  McCormick's final task is to find Helen in the present day. McCormick commandeers a B-25 bomber from an air show with Nat a [[stowaway]] on board. Nat helps McCormick land when another attack nearly kills him. His true age having finally caught up with him, the now-elderly McCormick reunites with the elderly Helen and asks her to marry him and she accepts.  
Fortress (1992 film)
 In a [[dystopian]] 2017, ex-army officer John Henry Brennick and his wife Karen are attempting to cross the [[Canada–United States border]] to [[Vancouver]] to have a second child. Strict one-child policies forbid a second pregnancy, even after their firstborn has died, so Karen wears a magnetic vest to trick the security scanners. A guard notices and raises the alarm.  Brennick is caught, believing Karen to have escaped, and sentenced to 31 years at the Fortress, a private maximum security prison run by the Men-Tel Corporation. To maintain discipline all inmates are implanted with "Intestinators" which induce severe pain or death as a form of physical control and mental conditioning.  The prison is co-run by Director Poe, who oversees Zed-10, a computer that monitors day-to-day activities.  The prison is located underground, in the middle of the desert, inside a deep pit that can only be crossed by a retractable bridge, while the prisoners are kept in overcrowded cells secured by laser walls.  John is imprisoned with inmates Abraham, a model prisoner who works as Poe's manservant and is awaiting [[parole]]; D-Day, a machine and demolitions expert; Nino Gomez and Stiggs, who tries to extort John. John learns his wife has been captured and is held in another level with his unborn child who, being illegal, is now officially owned by Men-Tel and will be confiscated at birth.  Stiggs has a friend, Maddox, who intimidates John and the two are involved in a brawl which culminates with Maddox being shot by a security turret. John manages to grab Maddox's Intestinator and gives it to D-Day before he is taken away to be subjected to a mind-wipe procedure as punishment.  Poe, infatuated with Karen, tells her that if she lives with him he will treat John well and release him from the mind-wipe chamber. She accepts to help John. Poe is revealed to be a cyborg, powerfully enhanced by Men-Tel cybernetics. Four months later, a heavily pregnant Karen manages to use her access to the prison computer in Poe's quarters to help John by restoring him from his mind-wiped state. Karen steals a holographic map and gives it to Abraham to give to John. D-Day dismantles Maddox's Intestinator and uses a magnetic component to pull out the others' Intestinators.  During their next work shift John's group puts their Intestinators in an air-duct and stage a brawl, causing Zed to trigger the devices and blow the duct open to prepare their escape. Poe promptly flushes the duct with steam and sends in "Strike Clones", networked cyborgs armed with flamethrowers and machine guns. Stiggs surrenders and gets shot dead, but the rest of the group kill a Strike Clone, steal its weapon and use it to kill the remaining clones.  Zed alerts Poe of Karen's actions. He reveals to her that her child, like all MenTel-owned babies, will be extracted in a fatal [[Caesarean]] to be made a cyborg. Abraham and Karen resist, but are powerless against the cyborg Poe and Abraham dies of strangulation.   Hijacking one of the gun turrets and using it as an elevator, John's group travels to Zed's control room. John takes Poe hostage and orders him to release Karen. Poe gives the order, but Zed refuses the command while stating that MenTel does not engage in any negotiations during hostage situations and a gun turret blasts Poe, blowing him to pieces and leaving John's group with no leverage. Once brought over to the core computer, D-Day [[Hacker (computer security)|hacks into]] Zed and accesses a powerful virus confiscated at the start of his sentence. D-Day manages to activate the virus after being shot and incapacited, causing a complete systems crash and all automated security to fail. John and Gomez rescue Karen, hijack a truck, and escape to Mexico where Karen enters labor in an abandoned barn and gives birth to her and John's child.  
Freddie as F.R.O.7
 The tale begins in the Middle Ages at Monaco, Monte Carlo, France. It tells of Prince Frederic, who is a 10-year-old boy who lived with his kingly father in a huge castle by the ocean at Monaco, and was taught magical powers. His mother, the queen, has been dead for over a year, drowned at sea in a storm. One day, while the two are out [[horse riding]] in the forest, Frederic loses his father who is thrown to his death from a great height (6&nbsp;ft) after his mount is spooked by a strange red cobra. Frederic watches it slither away; he had never seen one of those in the forest before. Now an orphan, Frederic is taken in by his paternal aunt, Messina ([[Billie Whitelaw]]), who, as the king's sister, accedes to the throne, but only as regent, until her nephew comes of age to assume responsibility as the next ruler when she must step down. Soon Frederic realizes that the cobra he saw in the forest was Messina (also responsible for conjuring up the storm that took the life of his mother) and rather than killing the young prince, she transformed him into a frog and tried to capture him. Soon, both fall from the castle window and into the raging ocean, and Frederic is saved in the jaws of a giant sea monster. The power-hungry Messina vows to rule the world and destroy Frederic. The monster really turns out to be [[Loch Ness Monster|Nessie]] ([[Phyllis Logan]]). As Messina departed, Nessie's tail became trapped under a boulder. She befriended Frederic, who in turn used his powers to free her tail from the boulder. Nessie took him near dry land, and notes that if Frederic ever needed her, he would whistle. Frederic then leaped into the night sky, jumped through time zones until the late 20th century and landed in a swamp full of frogs, where he would spend the rest of his childhood in his new life as Freddie the Frog.  Freddie eventually grows up to become a member of the [[French secret service]], known as F.R.O.7. and also has an [[anthropomorphic]] car (the reason for which is never explained). He is then called to London, England by the [[British Secret Service]], as some major famous buildings in the United Kingdom are vanishing. By the time Freddie arrives as he left Paris, France. [[Nelson's Column]], [[Tower of London]], [[Buckingham Palace]], [[St. Pauls Cathedral]], and [[Stonehenge]] are already missing. Freddie meets the Brigadier G ([[Nigel Hawthorne]]), who seems to have trouble keeping himself and his comrades from getting tangled up in the phone cord. Freddie is introduced to Daffers ([[Jenny Agutter]]), an Englishwoman who is an expert in martial arts, and Scotty, a Scotsman who is an expert with weapons. Things take a turn for the worse as [[Canterbury Cathedral]] disappears. Freddie also meets Trilby, a sneaky member of the secret service.  During a trip to [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]], Freddie discovers that the villain capturing the buildings is called El Supremo, and he's working alongside Messina, who spends most of the time in her cobra form. Freddie also learns that El Supremo is planning to steal [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]] next. Knowing Daffers and Scotty would not want to be taken, Freddie tells them the next target is [[Windsor Castle]] and they hide on Big Ben - and are promptly captured by a giant robotic snake. They go to a secret island in Scotland and discover that El Supremo plans to use the buildings, by shrinking them to a size of a trophy and using them as batteries to a giant crystal, which will send a powerful sleeping virus across the world (starting with the UK), which will put people to sleep, allowing him to invade and enslave them. Scotty then freaks out as the last required building is captured: [[Edinburgh Castle]].  Freddie and Scotty are thrown into a pool of sea monsters, while Daffers is taken to be brainwashed into a mindless follower of El Supremo and Messina. El Supremo uses the crystal to send his sleeping virus all across Great Britain and the whole country shuts down. Freddie whistles and Nessie appears to save them both from being devoured, and Scotty is saved from drowning. Nessie shows her family to Freddie, who then asks them to help defeat El Supremo by submerging the patrolling submarines. Freddie and Scotty save Daffers from the snake guards in disguise and the three return to stop El Supremo from conquering the world. They have to battle an army of soldiers, but in the process, Daffers and Scotty come too close to the crystal's energy and fall unconscious. Freddie manages to infiltrate the crystal's energy with his mind powers and destroys it, but also falls unconscious. El Supremo and Messina (who are preparing to attack their next target - The [[United States]]) arrive to kill Freddie, but he, Daffers and Scotty defeat El Supremo by shrinking him down to an ant's size and trapping him in a matchbox.  A final battle then ensues between Freddie and Messina, who attacks by shape-shifting consecutively into a bat, hyena, scorpion, and boa. As Messina begins to crush Freddie in her boa form, Freddie remembers comforting words from his late father and finds the strength to escape and toss Messina into an electrical pole high up and got electrocuted. Brigadier G and his team arrive in time, and Trilby is discovered to be a spy for the villains. Britain is restored to normal and Freddie heads off to deal with some bad guys in the United States.  
Full Contact
 The first part of the movie takes place in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]. Ko Fei's ([[Chow Yun-fat]]) friend Sam Sei ([[Anthony Wong (Hong Kong actor)|Anthony Wong]]) borrows money from a [[loan shark]] to give Ko Fei's departed mother a proper burial. The loan shark kidnaps Sam, and Ko Fei rescues him by confronting the loan shark and persuading him to give more time for Sam to re-pay the loan. The loan shark does not comply and orders his cohorts to kill Sam, but Ko Fei punches two of them before he engages a [[knife fight]] with the remaining gang members. After doing so, the loan shark attempts to shoot Ko Fei, but he wrestles the gun out of the shark's grasp, frees a trapped Sam Sei and escapes. Not wanting to lose face, the loan shark promises to kill them, so Ko Fei and Sam Sei flee the city.  To earn money, they team up with Sam's cousin Judge ([[Simon Yam]]) for a heist. The group meets up, although a fight between Ko Fei's and Judge's friend (Chung and Psycho respectively) breaks out, which is triggered by Ko Fei making remarks about Lau Ngang. After the initial group meeting, Judge, meanwhile, is offered money from the loan shark to kill Ko Fei and Sam during the heist.  The heist begins with Ko Fei blocking traffic while Lau Ngang tosses a grenade into an irate driver's car, which explodes. The intended target is a lorry and the group shoots and kills the passengers. Psycho gets in the truck but kicks Chung out and prevents him from boarding. The heist is successful, but Judge betrays Ko Fei by attempting to kill him, only to kill Chung instead. A car chase ensues between the two. The scene ends when Ko Fei flips his car up-side down. Judge examines the wreckage only to be ambushed by Ko Fei. Another fight ensues, Judge slices Ko Fei's right finger and thumb but is interrupted by a resident who shoots in the air telling them to leave.  The stolen truck, now occupied by Lau Ngang and Psycho, shoot at the house, killing everyone but a girl. Ko Fei takes shelter, but Sam Sei appears with a gun intending to kill Ko Fei (at the behest of Judge), but shoots him once in the chest and the rest at the floor. Sam Sei walks out with a pair of bloody eyes to prove that he has "killed" Ko Fei (Judge made remarks about Ko Fei's "mesmerising eyes" earlier). Convinced, he shoots the pressure cooker, causing it to explode, burning alive the previously shot resident and the girl, leaving her with 3rd degree burns.  Ko Fei, assumed to be dead, returns to the city, finding Sam now a competent gangster. Seemingly seeking revenge, he steals the shipment of guns Judge was hoping to sell and ransoms them back. The money is for the hospital stricken girl burned in the fire fight. The pair meet again, but not before Ko Fei guns down all of Judge's cohorts including Psycho. Judge gives Ko Fei the money and asks for the goods, but Ko Fei simply detonates the goods in the end, much to Judge's chagrin. The two shoot at each other, but it's Ko Fei who gains the upper hand when he throws his butterfly knife at Judge. Ko Fei finally kills Judge before quipping "Go masturbate in hell!"

Gardes-Marines III
 ...1757 year. In Europe the smell of gunpowder grows more noticeable. Two militant alliances: England and Prussia on one side, and Austria, France and Russia on the other, are engaged in the bloody [[Seven Years' War]].  Life separated the gardes-marines friends. Alexander Belov serves in Alaska, and Nikita Olenev – at the imperial court. Only Aleksei Korsak became captain of a ship. During a trip to Venice, Korsak rescues a shipwrecked man. The man is Baron von Brockdorf who serves in the Russian court, but in fact is a spy of King Frederick the Great, and also the lover of his wife, Prussian Queen Elizabeth-Christina. Brockdorf is arrested, but manages to escape, and now along with unsuspecting Korsak, he sails on a ship to Venice where the loving queen awaits him. In addition Duchess Joanna is located there, mother of Catherine. Several years ago on the orders of Bestuzhev, the duchess was banished from Russia for being a Prussian spy, but now she continues to faithfully serve Friedrich.  At this very time Nikita Olenev and his friend Pavel Gorin are traveling from distant Russia to Venice. Olenev, in love with Princess Fiquet from the moment of their acquaintance, performs a seemingly innocuous order of the Grand Duchess to hand over a box with jewellery to the Prussian queen. But in reality there is a hidden encrypted message in the box for Friedrich with the information that Empress Elizabeth is seriously ill, and the field-marshal Apraksin, commander-in-chief of the Russian troops in East Prussia, will only simulate the fighting, without joining the decisive battle with the Prussians. Pleased with this message, Joanna and Brockdorff write a reply message to Catherine, which again Nikita Olenev, the involuntary "courier" of Prussian espionage, must convey.  When the duchess learns that Brockdorf arrived in Venice on Korsak's ship, she decides to be safe and destroy Korsak. The attempt fails, but the young Russian captain is accused of murder and imprisoned. With the help of Olenev and Gorin, as well as vagrant Venetian artists, they manage to abduct Korsak from prison, and moreover, friends manage to capture Brockdorff and urgently leave for Russia. On the road the midshipmen find an encrypted letter for Catherine, and Brockdorf manages to break away and escape.  Arriving in St. Petersburg, Olenev, despite all his love for "Fiquet", honestly tells Catherine that he will report about the secret correspondence to Bestuzhev, having however acquainted the Grand Duchess with the contents of the letter. Summoned by Elizabeth for interrogation, Catherine, warned by Olenev, skillfully evades all charges of high treason and espionage, and the aging empress restricting herself only to verbal threats, releases Catherine. Of course, Elizabeth does not believe a single word of the Grand Duchess, but she clearly understands that only Catherine, and not her stupid and absurd husband – heir to the throne, Peter Fedorovich, will manage to rule such a huge and complex country as the Russian Empire.  Gardes-marines friends advance to the active army of Apraksin. Field-marshal, who received a direct order from the Empress to attack Friedrich's troops, still commits a dirty trick. Cavalry, the main power of the Russian army is sent away from the battlefield. Friedrich, knowing this, is confident of success and boasts to his generals that it is near Gross-Jägersdorf that he will destroy the "Russian bear". Initially the battle develops in favor of the Prussians, their cavalry mercilessly shreds the defenseless Russian infantry to pieces, which cries for help. In spite of Apraksin's strict prohibition, the midshipmen succeed in capturing the Russian cavalry for the attack of Friedrich's troops, and then a decisive turn comes in battle. The Prussian army is defeated, it flees, and the king himself almost falls into captivity. It would seem that success must be promoted and that the army should move directly to Berlin, but... Apraksin orders to retreat, and all the blood shed by Russians, all the casualties of this victorious battle turn out to be in vain...

The Gaze of the Gorgon
 [[File:Gorgon at the Archaeological Museum in Corfu.jpg|thumb|250px|The full Gorgon pediment]] In an article written for ''[[The Guardian]]'' Harrison stated that "Statues are one of the ways I try to test the traditions of European culture against the most modern destructive forces", and this is the reason why he used Heine's statue as the mouthpiece of ''The Gaze of the Gorgon''.<ref name="The poetic gaze"></ref>  In the film-poem, Harrison represents the Kaiser as a scholar [[archaeologist]] who is doing excavations in Corfu attempting to unearth the Gorgon pediment from the site where the ruins of the [[Artemis Temple of Corfu]] were situated. Harrison combines Heine's real-life predicament of having to leave from his homeland of Germany with the eviction of Heine's statue from the Corfu Achilleion and creates a common thread for his film-poem by having Heine's statue meander through Europe and moving from one European place to another delivering the narration of the film through the petrified mouth of Heine's statue.<ref name=BFI/> In the film, the narrative of the poem begins as follows:<ref name="Shanks1996"/>  Harrison uses the myth of the petrifying gaze of the Gorgon to analyse the common elements of the war-related atrocities of the twentieth century and to demonstrate that the war crimes of governments or the social failures of the capitalist system transcend historical time periods and they have the common element of turning individuals and societies to metaphorical stones as demonstrated by their apathy, inflexibility and intolerance.

Glengarry Glen Ross (film)
 The film depicts two days in the lives of four [[real estate]] salesmen who are supplied with [[Lead generation|leads]]: the names and phone numbers of [[Prospect (marketing)|prospects]]; they use deceitful and dubious tactics to make sales. Many of the leads rationed out by the office manager lack either the money or the desire to actually invest in land.  Blake (Baldwin) is sent by Mitch and Murray, the owners of Premiere Properties, to motivate the sales team. Blake unleashes a torrent of verbal abuse on the salesmen and announces that only the top two will be allowed access to the more promising Glengarry leads and the rest of them will be fired.  Shelley "The Machine" Levene (Lemmon), a once powerful and successful salesman, now in a long-running slump and with a [[Chronic pain|chronically ill]] daughter in the hospital with an unknown medical condition, knows that he will lose his job soon if he cannot generate sales. He tries to persuade office manager John Williamson (Spacey) to give him some of the Glengarry leads, but Williamson refuses. Levene tries first to charm Williamson, then to threaten him, and finally to bribe him. Williamson is willing to sell some of the prime leads, but demands cash in advance. Levene cannot come up with the cash and leaves without better leads.  Meanwhile, Dave Moss (Harris) and George Aaronow (Arkin) complain about Mitch and Murray, and Moss proposes that they strike back at the two by stealing all the Glengarry leads and selling them to a competing real estate agency. Moss's plan requires Aaronow to break into the office, stage a burglary and steal all of the prime leads. Aaronow wants no part of the plan, but Moss tries to coerce him, saying that Aaronow is already an [[accessory before the fact]] simply because he knows about the proposed burglary.  At a nearby bar, [[Richard Roma|Ricky Roma]] (Pacino), the office's top "closer", delivers a long, disjointed but compelling monologue to a meek, middle-aged man named James Lingk (Pryce). Roma does not broach the subject of a Glengarry Farms real estate deal until he has completely won Lingk over with his speech. Framing it as an opportunity rather than a purchase, Roma plays upon Lingk's feelings of insecurity.  The next day, when the salesmen come into the office, they learn that there has been a burglary and the Glengarry leads have been stolen. Williamson and the police question each of the salesmen in private. After his interrogation, Moss leaves in disgust, only after having one last shouting match with Roma. During the cycle of interrogations, Lingk arrives to tell Roma that his wife has told him to cancel the deal. Scrambling to salvage the deal, Roma tries to deceive Lingk by telling him that the check he wrote the night before has yet to be cashed, and that accordingly he has time to reason with his wife and reconsider.  Levene abets Roma by pretending to be a wealthy investor who just happens to be on his way to the airport. Williamson, unaware of Roma and Levene's stalling tactic, lies to Lingk, claiming that he already deposited his check in the bank. Upset, Lingk rushes out of the office, and Roma berates Williamson for what he has done. Roma then enters Williamson's office to take his turn at being interrogated by the police.  Levene, proud of a massive sale he made that morning, takes the opportunity to mock Williamson in private. In his zeal to get back at Williamson, Levene accidentally reveals that he knows Williamson lied to Roma minutes earlier about depositing Lingk's check and had left the check on his desk and had not made the bank run the previous night — something only a man who broke into the office would know. Williamson catches Levene's slip of the tongue and compels Levene to admit that he broke into the office. Levene finally caves in and admits that he and Moss conspired to steal the leads. Levene attempts to bribe Williamson to keep quiet about the burglary. Williamson scoffs at the suggestion and tells Levene that the buyers to whom he had made his sale earlier that day are in fact bankrupt and delusional and just enjoy talking to salesmen. Levene, crushed by this revelation, asks Williamson why he seeks to ruin him. Williamson coldly responds, "Because I don't like you."  Levene makes a last-ditch attempt at gaining sympathy from Williamson by mentioning his daughter's health, but Williamson cruelly rebuffs him and leaves to inform the detective about Levene's part in the burglary. Williamson walks out of the room as Roma enters. Unaware, Roma talks to Levene about their forming a business partnership. The detective calls for Levene, who walks into Williamson's office. Roma leaves the office to go for lunch. Aaronow returns to his desk to make his sales calls.

Seeing how well Tommy is able to fight, a local boxing promoter by the name of Pappy Jack offers Tommy a chance to fight in an illegal underground boxing operation. When two men arrive announcing that Tommy's father owes a large sum of money to pay off gambling debts, Jack convinces his boss, boxing promoter Jimmy Horn to buy out the debt, which forces Tommy to pay off his father's debts by boxing.  Tommy enjoys a great deal of success and develops a friendship with Romano and Abraham "Lincoln" Haines, two fellow fighters. However, he continues to be harassed by gang members, and discovers that two of them, "Black Death" and "Short Cut" are boxers who fight dirty, using elbows, kicks, knees, and low blows, and counting on the crooked refs to overlook the clear violations.  Tommy defeats Black Death in the ring, but Short Cut hides a fluid in his gloves, which he uses to blind Romano during a match.  Unable to defend himself, Romano is brutally beaten in the ring and is declared brain dead by the doctors.  Short Cut later tries the same trick on Tommy, but Tommy has learned to fight dirty, and defeats Short Cut.  Meanwhile, Lincoln shows signs of possible brain damage and is told to quit fighting for at least 60 days or else suffer permanent brain damage.  Despite this, Horn arranges a match between Lincoln and Tommy.  Afraid of killing Lincoln, Tommy takes a beating until the two are unwilling to continue the match.  In revenge, Horn, a former boxer who retired undefeated, punches Lincoln severely enough to knock him out of the ring.  Furious, Tommy challenges Horn to a match.  If Horn wins, Tommy will continue to work for him indefinitely, but if Tommy wins, his father's debt is wiped clean.  Horn accepts on the condition that they fight bare-knuckle. Horn's vast experience with boxing initially gives him the upper hand, and Horn's confidence influences him to play with and humiliate Tommy as a result. Tommy eventually uses the various forms of advice he has received throughout his brief boxing experience to outthink Horn: he fakes a broken hand to give Horn even more confidence, and then uses the element of surprise to defeat Horn, freeing himself from Horn's contract.

Six months later, explorer Takuya Fujito is detained after stealing an ancient artifact. Later, a representative of the Japanese Prime Minister offers to have Takuya's charges dropped if he explores Infant Island with his ex-wife, Masako Tezuka and Kenji Ando, the secretary of the rapacious Marutomo company. After the trio arrives on the island, they find a cave containing a depiction of two giant insects in battle. Further exploration leads them to a giant egg and a pair of diminutive humanoids called Cosmos, who identify the egg as belonging to [[Mothra]].  The Cosmos tell of an ancient civilization that tried to control the Earth's climate, thus provoking the Earth into creating Battra, which became uncontrollable, and started to harm the very planet that created it. Mothra, another earth protector, fought an apocalyptic battle with Battra, who eventually lost. The Cosmos explain how the meteoroid uncovered Mothra's egg, and may have awoken Battra, who is still embittered over humanity's interference in the Earth's natural order.  The Marutomo company sends a freighter to Infant Island to pick up the egg, ostensibly to protect it. As they are sailing, Godzilla surfaces and heads toward the newly hatched Mothra larva. Battra, also as a larva, soon appears and joins the fight, allowing Mothra to retreat. The battle between Godzilla and Battra is eventually taken underwater, where the force of the battle causes a giant crack in the ocean's floor that swallows the two.

Mothra enters Tokyo in an attempt to rescue the Cosmos, but is attacked by the JSDF. The wounded Mothra heads for the Diet building and starts building a cocoon around herself. Meanwhile, Godzilla surfaces from [[Mount Fuji]].  Both Mothra and Battra attain their imago forms and converge at Yokohama Cosmo World. Godzilla interrupts the battle and attacks Battra. The two moths decide to join forces against Godzilla. Eventually, Mothra and Battra overwhelm Godzilla and carry it over the ocean. Godzilla bites Battra's neck and fires its atomic breath into the wound, killing Battra. A tired Mothra drops Godzilla and the lifeless Battra into the water below, sealing Godzilla below the surface by creating a mystical glyph with scales from her wings. The next morning, the Cosmos explain that Battra had been waiting many years to destroy an even larger meteoroid that would threaten the Earth in 1999. Mothra had promised she would stop the future collision if Battra were to die, and she and the Cosmos leave Earth as the humans bid farewell.

Norman returns to his home in an attempt to find his son, Harry, who has left New York.  In his room, he finds a newspaper detailing a battle between Spider-Man and The Green Goblin that led to the explosion of Osborn's factory.  He then hears the porch door open, and goes to find Peter Parker waiting.  Upset that it is not his son, Norman gets angry with Peter before he goes back into his house.  As Osborn goes back to the old newspaper, he realizes that the explosion from the factory must have caused his amnesia.

But he is tracked down by Peter in his Spider-Man suit, who smashes The Goblin's glider after an intense fight that destroys Peter's costume. After being asked why he killed Gwen by Peter, he is apathetic towards her death. Insulting her in the process.  Enraged, Peter almost beats the Goblin to death.  He stops himself just before, leaving the Goblin to wake up and activate his glider. Just as the Goblin's glider is about to impale Peter, his spider sense activates, and he quickly jumps out of the way. Leaving the glider to impale the Goblin to death.  At a cemetery where Peter Parker, a quarter of his face bandaged, apologizes at Gwen Stacy's grave. He says he is sorry he never told her he was Spider-Man and that his life is nothing without her, and that the Goblin's death only made the pain worse.

Hero (1992 film)
  Bernie LaPlante ([[Dustin Hoffman]]) is a [[pickpocket]] and petty criminal who anonymously rescues survivors including TV reporter Gale Gayley ([[Geena Davis]]) at an [[Accidents and incidents in aviation|airplane crash]]. His motives are not "pure" as he enters the burning plane in order to steal some of the passengers' purses and wallets, losing a shoe in the process. After finding his car is towed away from the crash scene, he flags down John Bubber ([[Andy Garcia]]), a homeless Vietnam veteran, and tells him about the rescue at the crash site, giving him his remaining shoe. When Deke ([[Chevy Chase]]), the television station news director, offers $1 million to the "Angel of Flight 104", Bernie realizes he can't claim the reward, due to his arrest while [[fence (criminal)|fencing]] credit cards he stole from the people he rescued. John, however, contacts Gale, recounting Bernie's tale of the rescue and provides the single shoe to take credit for the selfless act.  When Bernie tries to tell people that John is a fake, the media, after sensationalizing his heroic image, will not believe Bernie. Gale, as one of the crash survivors, considers herself to be in John's debt and soon grooms his public image. She finds herself falling in love with him even though she has questions about his authenticity. Despite his reluctant acceptance of his fame, he turns out to be a decent person, using his notoriety and reward money to help sick children and the homeless.    John finds himself in an ethical dilemma since his persona is inspirational to countless people. Meanwhile, Bernie continues to aggravate his ex-wife, Evelyn ([[Joan Cusack]]), and fails to bond with his son, Joey ([[James Madio]]), who is now enamored with John. He begins to feel that if Joey is going to idolize anyone, perhaps John is the better choice.  A police detective tells Gale her credit cards were recovered during Bernie's arrest. She and her cameraman, Chucky ([[Kevin J. O'Connor (actor)|Kevin J. O'Connor]]), break into Bernie's apartment with the help of Winston ([[Maury Chaykin]]), the landlord. While searching for evidence to incriminate Bernie, Gale finds a stolen Silver Microphone Award that she won in [[New York City]], the night before the crash. Bernie arrives only to be confronted by her, who speculates that John stole her purse in a moment of weakness during the rescue, sold it to Bernie, and accuses him of attempting to now blackmail John. They are interrupted by Winston, who says John is on television, about to commit suicide by jumping from the ledge of a high-rise skyscraper.   Gale rushes to the scene and brings Bernie along, threatening to have him prosecuted if John leaps to his death. In addition, she demands Bernie apologize for the attempted blackmail. Evelyn and Joey rush there as well, with Evelyn reminiscing how Bernie is selfish and cynical, but always becomes a great person in a crisis.  When they arrive, Bernie goes out on the ledge, hatching a scheme to milk the media attention for all its worth. Ultimately, he convinces John that the world needs a hero, and that he is clearly the right one for the job, though he does negotiate a discreet share of the $1 million. When Bernie slips off the ledge, John grabs him and pulls him to safety, a (true) hero once more. When Gale sees Bernie's face covered with dirt, as on the night of the crash, she realizes it was he who saved her. She confronts him "off the record" with her supposition, but he insists that John was the hero.   As Gale leaves, however, she thanks Bernie for saving her life; and he impulsively replies, "You're welcome." She tells him to tell Joey the truth. John agrees to continue playing the part of public hero. While on an excursion to the zoo, Bernie decides to tell Joey the true story of the crash. After he does so, a lady cries out that her daughter has fallen into the lion's cage. Joey pleads with him to help, to which he sighs, slips off his shoes, and heads off to see what he can do.  
Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth
 The revelation of his own former humanity in ''[[Hellbound: Hellraiser II|Hellraiser II]]'' has resulted in the [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobite]], [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]], being split into two different entities: his former self, [[World War I]] [[British Army]] Captain Elliot Spencer, and a manifestation of Spencer's [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]], which takes on the form of Pinhead. While Spencer ends up in [[limbo]], Pinhead is trapped, along with the [[Lemarchand's box|puzzle box]], among the writhing figures and distorted faces etched into the surface of an intricately carved pillar&nbsp;— the Pillar of Souls.  The pillar is bought by J. P. Monroe, the rich owner of a popular nightclub called The Boiler Room. During her investigation, an ambitious young television reporter, Joey Summerskill, slowly begins to learn about Pinhead and the mysterious puzzle box.  Joey is introduced to the pain the box can bring when she witnesses a teenage clubgoer being ripped apart by the box's chains in a hospital emergency room. Joey tracks the box and a young woman named Terri to The Boiler Room nightclub.  Video tape interviews are recovered from the Channard Institute of one of Pinhead's former victims Kirsty Cotton. Joey and Terri learn through the videos about the demonic Cenobites and how the Lament Configuration puzzle box is the only means of sending Pinhead back to Hell. Pinhead remains dormant until one night several hooked chains shoot out of the pillar and rip into one of the club goers, Sandy, whom Monroe had just had sex with. After killing Sandy, Pinhead consumes her flesh and her distorted face appears on the pillar. Pinhead convinces Monroe to bring him more club members so he can feed on them and be freed from the pillar.  Meanwhile, Joey is contacted by the spirit of Elliot Spencer, who tells her that this "Pinhead" is a separate entity than the one encountered by Kirsty previously.  Without Spencer's humanity to act as a balancing influence, Pinhead is completely evil and has no sense of order. Rather than abide by the laws of the Cenobite realm, he will indiscriminately wreak havoc on Earth for his own pleasure. In order to defeat him, Joey must reunite Spencer's spirit with Pinhead, fusing them back into a single entity.  Pinhead and Joey confront each other in The Boiler Room after Pinhead massacres the club's patrons in various grotesque ways. Pinhead says that he exists to force humanity to recognize the darkness in their heart and his freedom is the only way to enable it. He orders Joey to give him the box, but she breaks free and flees the club. Pinhead resurrects a few of the corpses of his victims as Cenobites: Terri, transformed into a cigarette-smoking Cenobite that can dream, which she was unable to do as a human; Monroe, who has pistons stuck through his skull; the Barman, who has barbed wire wrapped around his head and spits fire from his mouth; The DJ, who has CDs impaled into his skull and throws CDs full speed at his victims; and 'Doc' (Joey's former cameraman), who has a TV camera forcibly embedded in his eye socket. Joey flees through the quiet streets, pursued by the new Cenobites. Local police are killed by the Cenobites as Joey enters a church and begs the priest to help her. Lacking in faith that demons could exist, the priest is appalled by the appearance of Pinhead. The Cenobites trap Joey on a construction site and prepare to torture her. When the Lament Configuration activates, they are quickly sent to hell. Joey finds herself in a heaven-like realm and comes face to face with an apparition who appears to be her dead father. The apparition tells Joey to give him the puzzle box, only to be revealed as Pinhead in disguise.  Pinhead ensnares her in machinery and prepares to transform her into a Cenobite. He is confronted by Spencer's spirit, who forcibly fuses himself into Pinhead. Joey breaks free and uses the altered Lament Configuration to stab Pinhead through the heart, finally sending him back to Hell. With Pinhead's humanity restored, Joey buries the Puzzle Box in a pool of concrete at the construction site. Later, the finished product of the same site is revealed: a building constructed where Joey buried the box, and the interior design is identical to the Lament Configuration.

Hedd Wyn (film)
 As the camera pans over the intricate carving on the infamous "Black Chair", the voice of the [[Archdruid]] Dyfed is heard vainly summoning the poet who signs his work with the ''nom de plume'' "[[Fleur-de-lys|Fleur-de-lis]]" to stand and be [[Chairing of the Bard|chaired]]. The film then [[Flashback (narrative)|flashes back]] to 1913.  As a farmer's son in the village of [[Trawsfynydd]], Ellis Humphrey Evans composes poetry for local [[eisteddfod]]au under the bardic name ''Hedd Wyn'' ("Blessed Peace"). A friend and student minister, William Morris ([[Arwel Gruffydd]]), advises Ellis that his verse possesses a passion which better educated poets lack. Therefore, with more work and less womanizing, Ellis could win the National Eisteddfod. Ellis smiles and quips, "Where do you think all that passion comes from?"  Meanwhile, international tensions rise and the [[British Army]] installs an artillery range on a local hillside, much to Ellis' annoyance.  In August 1914, Britain declares war on the [[German Empire]]. Soon afterwards, at a gathering in the village street, an [[Church in Wales|Anglican]] minister gives a rousing sermon which demands immediate enlistment. Disgusted, William Morris calls the Anglican minister "a disgrace to his calling", and tells those nearby not to be deceived. In spite of this, several young men from Trawsfynydd join the British Army, including Ellis' friend Griff Jones ([[Gruffudd Aled]]).  Despite mounting pressure, Ellis refuses to enlist and says that he doesn't think he can kill anyone. As a result, Ellis' fiancée, Lizzie Roberts ([[Sue Roderick]]), accuses him of being "afraid of becoming a man". At a fair, Ellis attempts to mend his relationship with Lizzie, only to find that she has taken up with an English soldier. "It is nothing personal," she says coldly, "I just don't like your clothes." Later, in the village pub, Ellis and Moi Davies ([[Emlyn Gomer]]) are giving Griff, who is now in uniform, a send-off. As fellow villagers sing the recruiting song "[[Your King and Country Want You]]" in their honor, Lizzie appears in the pub's doorway. Ellis spots her and begins to loudly sing "[[Myfanwy]]", a song with implications of female betrayal. Sensing Lizzie's distress, her new beau punches Ellis in the face, screaming, "You're upsetting the lady! Welsh bastard!"  On a train, Ellis encounters Jini Owen ([[Judith Humphreys]]), a young woman who admires his poetry. Noticing her interest in him, Ellis asks for Jini's address and sends her a letter. Soon the two are deeply in love. Simultaneously, Ellis develops a close friendship with Mary Catherine Hughes ([[Nia Dryhurst]]), the young woman who is his sister's teacher. He explains to her that, whenever a poem is lacking, he will cast it into the river, and that it will always return to him stronger. On a railway journey with Jini, Ellis encounters two hideously disfigured war veterans. Despite his sympathy for their plight, the soldiers accuse Ellis of cowardice for remaining a civilian. As he and Jini depart, they threaten to mail him a white feather. Ellis quips, "You don't have any wings, let alone feathers."  Ultimately, Lizzie returns to the village with [[tuberculosis]]. After a church service, she informs Ellis that he was right about the war, which is a curse. Later, as Lizzie lies dying, Ellis visits her sickbed and promises to bring her to the National Eisteddfod. Soon afterwards, an official of the draft board arrives at the family farm and takes down the names of Ellis and his brother Bob (Ceri Cunnington), despite the resistance of Ellis' mother ([[Llio Silyn]]). As a result, the Crown informs the Evans family that one of their sons must join the British Army.  Although 17-year-old Bob longs to enlist instead, Ellis refuses to permit this. Horrified of losing him, Jini pleads with Ellis to let Bob enlist in his place. Enraged, Ellis says that, if Bob were injured or killed, he could never live with himself. With Jini seeing him off, Ellis departs by train to join the [[Royal Welsh Fusiliers]] in [[Liverpool]].<ref name="Archifau"/> Despite the insults showered on them by their English-speaking [[drill sergeant]], Ellis and his fellow Fusiliers continue their training in good spirits and are sent to France. Facing what may be his last chance to win the Eisteddfod, Ellis pleads with his platoon commander to send his [[awdl]] ''[[Hedd Wyn#Yr Awr|Yr Arwr]]'' (The Hero) via the Army Postal Service. The young officer, who is unable to read Welsh, at first refuses, suspecting the poem to be a coded message to the [[Imperial German Army|Germans]].  Eventually he relents, mails Ellis' submission, and praises him as "The [[Armageddon]] Poet".  On 31 July 1917, the [[Welsh Guards|Fusiliers]] go [[Going over the top|over the top]] and into the [[Battle of Passchendaele]]. Crawling through swampy shell holes filled with corpses, Ellis witnesses his fellow soldiers being shot and blown to pieces around him. At last, he is wounded by [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and crumples to the ground. After hours of lying in [[no man's land]], Ellis is evacuated to an aid post, where he succumbs from his injuries. His devastated parents receive a [[telegram]] with news of Ellis' death. Jini weeps inconsolably as she reads Ellis' last letter, in which her beloved proposed marriage in a poem. Mary Catherine, in a last tribute to her friend, casts the manuscript of Ellis' poem ''Rhyfel'' (War) into the river.  The Evans family receives another telegram which announces that Ellis' submission has won the National Eisteddfod. To the sound of [[R. Williams Parry]]'s ''[[Englynion coffa Hedd Wyn]]'' ([[Englyn]]ion in memory of Hedd Wyn), the chair which Ellis has dreamed of all his life is delivered to his parents' farmhouse, robed in black.

Highway Heartbreaker
 Catherine ([[Linda Gray]]) is a wealthy and lonely woman who has been handicapped ever since getting involved in a car accident, which she herself caused on the day of signing her divorce papers four years prior due to driving under the influence. During the accident she broke her back and suffered third degree burns. One day while driving on the highway, she meets Mickey Kenton ([[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]]), who claims to run investments for his father. She immediately falls for his charms and they start dating straight away. One day, he borrows $30,000 from her for a 'promising stock offer' in medial equipment, then vanishes following the money transaction. Catherine grows convinced that he is kidnapped and contacts private investigator Bert Quinn ([[Brock Peters]]), but he quickly finds out that Mickey is a con man. Quinn tracks Mickey down and threatens to unmask him.   Meanwhile, Mickey meets Alex ([[Heather Locklear]]), an overworked but very ambitious stock broker on the verge of breaking in a major corporate client. Her father ([[Dick O'Neill]]) disapproves of her car purchases which she claims will help her land the breakthrough she desperately wants. She is immediately infatuated with Mickey, who now claims to be in international trade. Aspiring to get into international trade herself, Alex repeatedly meets up with Mickey in hopes of starting a joint venture. When one day she lands a deal with the corporate client, she uses the $15,000 acquired from the deal to invest in a business deal with Mickey. A day later, he tells her the stakes have been raised and that he needs an additional $25,000 dollars, which in reality he intends to use to buy a car. Even though she does not have the money, she draws him the cheque, hopeful that she will land another deal within the company. However, immediately after signing the cheque she finds out that the major client has pulled back. However, Mickey is unwilling to return her the money and threatens to harm her if she goes to the police. She nevertheless contacts the police, who reveal that Mickey is a con man with several aliases.  By that time, Mickey has already moved on to his new victim, Annie ([[Tracy Nelson (actress)|Tracy Nelson]]), a young woman running a charity for a church who needs to raise $5,000 dollars for a children's clinic on a short term. Mickey lures her into a private investment deal, claiming that she can get $6,000 dollars out of a $1,000 dollar investment. While staying at her place, he is once again approached by Quinn and realizes that the private investigator will not leave him alone. Therefore, he decides to return to Catherine and convinces her that he had to leave town for a while for his mother's funeral. She forgives him and allows him to move in with her. Meanwhile, the police and Quinn build a strong case against Mickey and track down the car that he bought with Alex's money. Alex immediately heads out to the car dealer to retrieve the car and finds Catherine, who was told by Mickey that the car was bought in her name. Alex tells Catherine that Mickey is a con man, but she refuses to believe her. A short while later, Mickey is arrested and the media reveal all of his cons. Alex and Annie are the only two victims stepping forward, and Alex even sells all of her belongings to finance the case against him.   Despite the media attention and the warnings of her teenage daughter Emily ([[Dedee Pfeiffer]]), Catherine bails him out of jail and elopes with him. When the trial against Mickey starts, however, she slowly starts to believe the accusations against him and eventually teams up with Alex and Annie. At that moment, Mickey claims to have left to Arizona for work, but the bail requires him to call in once a day. In Arizona, he is already working on a new victim when the three women lure him into town with a fake story. When he arrives, he is arrested and sent off to jail. In the closing credits, it is revealed that Mickey was given a suspended sentence, contingent upon restitution to his victims. However, no restitution was ever made.  
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York
  The McCallister family is preparing to spend Christmas in [[Miami]], gathering at Peter and Kate's home outside of [[Chicago]]. Peter and Kate's youngest son, Kevin, sees Florida as contradictory to Christmas, on his opinion of the lack of Christmas trees in Florida. A fight with his older brother Buzz during the school's Christmas pageant results in Kevin storming to the third floor of his house shortly afterward. During the night, Peter resets the alarm clock, causing the entire family to oversleep. In the confusion and rush to get to the airport, Kevin inadvertently boards a flight bound for [[New York City]] while trying to replace the batteries for his [[Talkboy]] and carrying Peter's bag containing his [[wallet]]. While there, Kevin tours the city and meets a homeless woman tending to [[pigeons]] at [[Central Park]], where he runs off. Kevin goes to the [[Plaza Hotel]], where he uses Peter's [[credit card]] to check in. Meanwhile, the "Wet Bandits", Harry and Marv, have traveled to New York City after escaping during a prison riot.  On Christmas Eve, Kevin tours the city in a [[limousine]] and visits a toy store where he meets its philanthropic owner, Mr. Duncan. Kevin learns that the proceeds from the store's Christmas sales will be donated to a children's [[hospital]]. Kevin donates $20 to the hospital. As a token of appreciation, Mr. Duncan offers Kevin a pair of ceramic turtledoves as a gift, instructing him to give one to another person as a sign of eternal friendship. After encountering Harry and Marv, Kevin retreats to the Plaza. The hotel's [[concierge]], Mr. Hector, confronts Kevin about the credit card, which has been reported stolen. Kevin flees after evading Mr. Hector and runs into Harry and Marv once again; they discuss for breaking into the toy store that night before Kevin escapes.  Kate discovers after flying to Miami that Kevin is missing and, after tracking the whereabouts of the stolen credit card, she and the rest of the family flies to New York City to search for Kevin. Meanwhile, Kevin goes to his uncle Rob's townhouse, only to find the house vacant and undergoing renovations, while Rob and his family are in [[Paris]]. At Central Park, he encounters and befriends the pigeon lady. They go to [[Carnegie Hall]], where an orchestra is performing. The pigeon lady explains how her life collapsed and how she dealt with it by taking care of the pigeons in the park. Kevin gives the pigeon lady some advice and promises that he will be her friend.  Kevin returns to the townhouse and rigs it with numerous booby traps. He arrives at the toy store during Harry and Marv's robbery and throws a brick through the window, setting off the store's alarm. Kevin then lures the duo to the townhouse, where they spring the traps and suffer various injuries. While the duo pursues Kevin outside of the townhouse, he calls the police before Harry and Marv catch him and discuss how they will kill him in Central Park, but the pigeon lady sneaks in and has the pigeons incapacitate them. Kevin sets off fireworks he had bought earlier to signal the police. The police arrive and arrest Harry and Marv. At the toy store, Mr. Duncan finds a note from Kevin attached to the brick, explaining about what happened.  While searching for Kevin, Kate remembers his fondness for Christmas trees. After observing Kevin making a wish at the [[Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree]], Kate meets him there and they reconcile. On Christmas Day, a truckload of gifts arrive at the McCallisters' hotel room from the toy store. Kevin and Buzz reconcile, and Buzz allows him to open up the first present. Kevin goes to Central Park to give the pigeon lady the second turtledove. At the Plaza, Buzz receives the bill for Kevin's stay from Cedric and shows it to Peter. Peter suddenly calls out, "Kevin, you spent $967 on room service?" at which point Kevin runs off to the hotel.  
Hoffa
 On July 30, 1975, Jimmy Hoffa and his longtime friend, Bobby Ciaro are impatiently waiting in the parking lot of a roadhouse diner. Moving in vignettes from his early years when Hoffa was a [[Teamsters]] union organizer who was working to organize the various trucking firms and laundries around Detroit, Michigan, Hoffa's life over the preceding four decades gradually unfolds. In 1935, a young Hoffa approaches a parked truck, inside of which driver Ciaro is taking a nap. Hoffa pitches the benefits of joining the [[Teamsters]] and gives Ciaro a business card, on which he has written: "Give this man whatever he needs." A few days later, Ciaro reports to work to find Hoffa attempting to organize the workers. Hoffa blurts out they'd ridden 85 miles together, and Ciaro is fired. Ciaro later accosts Hoffa with a [[Bowie knife]], but Hoffa's associate Billy Flynn pulls a gun and Ciaro drops the knife. Ciaro joins the pair in the arson bombing of a laundry whose owner has refused to cooperate with the Teamsters. Flynn is badly burned and dies. Ciaro succeeds him as Hoffa's right-hand man.  During a Teamsters strike, strikers fight with non-union workers and police, Hoffa is taken to a local Mafia boss. Ciaro, who speaks Italian, comes along and translates. An alliance between the Teamsters and the mob is formed. Hoffa meets Carol D'Allesandro, who would become his closest mob ally. Hoffa rises to the presidency of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. His illegal activities include the use of Teamster funds to make loans to the mob. At a Congressional hearing, Hoffa is questioned by [[Robert F. Kennedy]] regarding his suspicious union activities. A loud and bitter feud between Kennedy and Hoffa grows, especially after [[John F. Kennedy]] is elected President and Bobby becomes Attorney General.  Hoffa, on a hunting trip with D'Allesandro, discusses ways to exploit the union's pension fund. Having no paper with them, the plans are sketched on the back of a hunting license. Subsequently, Hoffa is betrayed by a junior associate, Peter Connelly, who testifies at Hoffa's trial. The critical evidence against Hoffa is the hunting license on which the plans to raid the Teamster's pension fund were written. Hoffa surrenders to federal officials and serves time in a Pennsylvania federal prison while Connelly's uncle, [[Frank Fitzsimmons]], takes over as Teamsters boss. Ciaro, also convicted and imprisoned, is freed and immediately begins working for Hoffa's release. D'Allesandro suggests that the Teamsters endorse [[Richard M. Nixon]] for President, so that in exchange for Teamster endorsement, Hoffa will receive a presidential pardon.  Hoffa gets out and expects to again run the Teamsters, but learns that one of the conditions of his release is that he is ineligible to run the union for 10 years. Hoffa meets with D'Allesandro and demands to the gangster that Fitzsimmons be killed, which resulted in someone wiring Fitz's car to explode. D'Allesandro believes that Hoffa is "too hot" and says, "I can't get close to it." Hoffa leaves with the matter unresolved.  Ciaro delivers a message to D'Allesandro that unless the matter of Fitzsimmons can be settled, Hoffa will go to the press. D'Allesandro says to tell Hoffa that "everything's gonna be all right", and they should all meet the next day at "the roadhouse", a remote diner.  Hoffa and Ciaro spend several hours waiting in the parking lot, but D'Allesandro never arrives. A purported union driver has been waiting for hours in the diner, allegedly for a part for his truck, engaging Ciaro in conversation. He is invited to meet Hoffa in person by bringing a cup of coffee to the car. The driver reveals himself to be a [[hit man]] as he draws a gun. Just exactly who sent this 'hit man' is not revealed, however, the implication is that he was sent by D'Allesandro in retaliation for Hoffa's threat to 'go to the press'. Hoffa and Ciaro are gunned down in the parking lot. Several associates arrive and dump Ciaro's body on top of Hoffa's and they get in the car and drive it into the back of a large truck that had driven up as the shootings were taking place. The camera focuses on the roll-up door of the truck showing the different state plates, implying a final bit of irony: that the truck driver, in all likelihood, is a Teamster driver. The truck drives off into the sunset.  
Honey, I Blew Up the Kid
  Three years after [[inventor]] Wayne Szalinski accidentally shrunk his and his neighbors' children, his family have moved to [[Nevada]], and welcomed a new son, mischievous 2 1/2-year old Adam. Wayne’s wife Diane leaves on a Friday with their daughter Amy for college, leaving Wayne to look after Adam and their teenage son Nick, who struggles with puberty. He develops a crush on Mandy Park, who Wayne later arranges to babysit Adam. One Saturday, Wayne takes his sons to Sterling Labs, where he has constructed an advanced derivative of his [[shrink ray]] which could make objects grow. He tests it out on Adam’s toy Big Bunny. However, when Wayne and Nick’s backs are turned, Adam attempts to retrieve his toy and is zapped by the machine, which appears to short circuit and not enlarge the targeted object.  Back home, Adam and Big Bunny are exposed to electrical waves from the [[microwave oven]] and grow in size, now seven feet tall. Wayne and Nick try to take Adam back to the lab to reverse the process, but are caught by Wayne’s superior Doctor Charles Hendrickson, who dislikes Wayne, later discovering his folly. Diane returns home and discovers the truth, and she, Wayne and Nick have a hard time trying to take care of the large Adam. Later, Wayne and Diane drive to a [[warehouse]] and retrieve Wayne’s first prototype to turn Adam back to normal. When Mandy arrives to babysit Adam, she panics and faints. Nick then ties her to a chair and gags her so she cannot run away or scream. As Nick explains the situation to Mandy, Adam is exposed to a television’s electrical waves and grows to fourteen feet, before escaping through a wall.  Nick and Mandy search for him, but they and Adam are taken into custody, with the latter placed into a truck. Wayne and Diane return home, finding the smug Hendrickson waiting for them. He has summoned Clifford Sterling, the company chairman, with the plan to fire Wayne and experiment on Adam. Sterling arrives, praising Wayne when he admits his mistake and agrees to help Adam, firing the rude Hendrickson as well. Adam grows even larger, escaping confinement, and heads for [[Las Vegas]], pursued by his family and the authorities. Adam mistakes Nick and Mandy for toys and puts them in his overalls pocket.  Hendrickson gets permission to board a military helicopter and tranquilize Adam. Wayne is determined to use his shrink machine to shrink Adam back to normal, but needs Adam to stand still for twelve seconds so he can be shrunk. At first, he tries using Big Bunny to pacify Adam, but it backfires when Wayne suggests his son takes a nap (which he hates). After wandering through Las Vegas, Adam saves the escaped Nick and Mandy in a sports car from falling off the Kicking Lady of Glitter Gulch ([[Fremont Street]]) and puts the car inside his pocket again, before pursuing an [[ice cream truck]] driven by Marshall Brooks to distract him away from the city. However, he continues to grow even larger and heads towards the [[Hard Rock Café]], where he plays the lit up guitar. Hendrickson arrives in the helicopter shooting tranquilizer cartridges at Adam, hitting the guitar instead and causing him to drop the guitar, crying from electric shock. Diane convinces Wayne to enlarge her so she can get to Adam, preventing Hendrickson from harming her son and getting Adam to stand still for the needed time period for the shrinking ray to work. Wayne then fires the shrink ray, returning Adam and Diane to normal size, but Nick and Mandy are gone. Hendrickson arrives, attempting to justify his actions, but Diane punches him in the face.  In the closing scene, Nick and Mandy are revealed to have been shrunk inside the car from inside Adam's pocket to the size of insects, only to be quickly found by Wayne. Wayne is proud of his son getting a girlfriend and decides to give them a few minutes of privacy before unshrinking them. The only problem left is to shrink gigantic Big Bunny to normal size.  
Honeymoon in Vegas
 Jack Singer (Cage) has sworn to his mother while she was on her deathbed that he would never get married.  Years later, he goes back on his promise and proposes to his girlfriend, Betsy (Parker), and quickly arranges a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas marriage]]. They check into the [[Bally's Las Vegas|Bally's Hotel]].  Before the wedding, however, a wealthy professional gambler, Tommy Korman (Caan), sees Betsy and notices a striking resemblance to his beloved late wife. He arranges a crooked poker game (with [[Jerry Tarkanian]] as one of the other players) where Jack borrows $65,000 after being dealt a straight flush (7-8-9-10-Jack of clubs), only to lose to the gambler's higher straight flush (8-9-10-Jack-Queen of hearts); Tommy, however, promises to erase the debt - if he can spend the weekend with Singer's fiancée.  After getting Korman to agree to no sex, the desperate couple agrees. Jack tries desperately to get Betsy back and discovers that Tommy has taken her to [[Hawaii]], where he has a vacation home. The gambler also has a taxi driver friend, Mahi Mahi (Pat Morita), and asks him to keep Jack as far as possible from him and Betsy. Jack discovers this, steals the taxi, and sees Betsy outside the Kauai Club, where he's attacked by Tommy and arrested. After Dr. Molar bails Jack out of jail, Mahi Mahi meets him outside and admits that Korman left for Vegas with Betsy and has convinced her to marry him. Mahi races Jack to the airport. Betsy decides she cannot go through with the wedding and escapes from Tommy.   Meanwhile, after changing many planes and finding himself stuck in San Jose, Jack tries frantically to find a flight to Vegas.  Finally, he finds a group about to depart for Vegas, but, much to his surprise, finds out mid-flight that they are the Utah chapter of the "Flying Elvises" - a [[skydiving]] team of [[Elvis impersonator]]s.  Jack now realizes that he will have to skydive from 3,000 feet in order to get to Betsy. Jack eventually is able to overcome his fear and lands and spots Betsy, which then ruins Tommy's plans.  The final scene shows Jack and Betsy getting married in a small Las Vegas chapel with the Flying Elvises as guests, Jack still in his white illuminated jumpsuit and Betsy in her stolen showgirl outfit.

Howards End (film)
 In [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edwardian]] Britain, Helen Schlegel becomes engaged to Paul Wilcox during a moment of passion, while she is staying at the country home of the Wilcox family, Howards End. The Schlegels are an intellectual family of Anglo-German [[bourgeoisie]], while the Wilcoxes are conservative and wealthy, headed by hard-headed businessman Henry. Helen and Paul quickly decide against the engagement, but Helen has already sent a telegram informing her sister Margaret, which causes an uproar when the sisters' Aunt Juley arrives and causes a scene. Months later, when the Wilcox family takes a flat across the street from the Schlegels in London, Margaret resumes her acquaintance with Ruth Wilcox, whom she had briefly met before. Ruth is descended from English [[yeoman]] stock and it is through her family that the Wilcoxes have come to own Howards End, a house she loves dearly.  Over the course of the next few months, the two women become very good friends, even as Mrs. Wilcox's health declines. Hearing that the lease on the Schlegels' house is due to expire, Ruth on her death bed bequeaths Howards End to Margaret. This causes great consternation to the Wilcoxes, who refuse to believe that Ruth was in her "right mind" or could possibly have intended her home to go to a relative stranger. The Wilcoxes burn the piece of paper on which Ruth's bequest is written, deciding to ignore it completely. Henry begins to develop an attraction to Margaret, offering to assist her in finding a new home. Eventually he proposes marriage, which Margaret accepts.  Some time before this, the Schlegels had befriended a young clerk, Leonard Bast, who lives with a woman of dubious origins named Jacky. Both sisters find Leonard remarkable, appreciating his intellectual curiosity and desire to improve his lot in life. The sisters pass along advice from Henry to the effect that Leonard must leave his post, because the insurance company he works for is supposedly heading for [[bankruptcy]]. Leonard takes the advice and quits, but has to settle for a job paying much less, which he eventually loses altogether. Helen is later enraged to learn that Henry's advice was wrong and the company was perfectly sound.  Months later, Henry and Margaret host the wedding of his daughter Evie at his [[Shropshire]] estate. Margaret is shocked when Helen arrives with the Basts, whom she has found living in deep poverty. Considering that Henry is responsible for their plight, she demands he help them. However Jacky becomes drunk at the reception, and when she sees Henry she recognises and exposes him as a former lover from years ago. Henry is embarrassed and ashamed to have been revealed as an [[adulterer]] in front of Margaret, but she forgives him and agrees to send the Basts away. After the wedding, Helen, upset with Margaret's decision to marry a man she loathes, leaves for Germany, but not before having sex with Leonard.  Margaret and Henry marry, with the pair arranging to use Howards End as storage for Margaret's belongings. After months of only hearing from Helen through postcards, Margaret grows concerned. When Aunt Juley falls ill, Helen returns to England to visit her but, when she receives word that her aunt has recovered, avoids seeing Margaret or any of her family. Thinking that Helen is mentally unstable, Margaret lures her to Howards End to collect her belongings, only to turn up herself with Henry and a doctor. However, on first glance she realises that Helen is heavily pregnant. Helen insists on returning to Germany to raise her baby alone, but asks that she be allowed to stay the night at Howards End before she leaves. When Margaret requests this from Henry, he stubbornly refuses and the two bicker.  The next day, Leonard, still living unhappily in poverty with Jacky, leaves London and travels to Howards End to see the Schlegels. When he arrives he finds the pair, as well as Henry's brutish eldest son Charles. Charles quickly realizes that Leonard is the baby's father, and begins assaulting him for "dishonouring" Helen. In his rage, he beats him with the flat of a sword, which causes Leonard to have a heart attack and die. The police charge Charles with manslaughter and Henry breaks down when Margaret tells him that she is leaving him to help raise Helen's baby.  A year later, Paul, Evie, and Charles's wife Dolly gather at Howards End. Henry and Margaret are still together, and living with Helen and her young son. Henry tells the others that upon his death, Margaret will receive Howards End, but no money, at her own request. Dolly points out the irony of Margaret inheriting the house, revealing Mrs. Wilcox's dying wish to Margaret for the first time. Henry admits to what happened, and Margaret appears to forgive him.  
Husbands and Wives
 The film is about two couples: Jack (Pollack) and Sally (Davis), and Gabe (Allen) and Judy (Farrow). The film starts when Jack and Sally arrive at Gabe and Judy's apartment and announce their separation. Gabe is shocked, but Judy takes the news personally and is very hurt. Still confused, they go out for dinner at a Chinese restaurant.  A few weeks later Sally goes to the apartment of a colleague. They plan to go out together to the [[opera]] and then to dinner. Sally asks if she can use his phone, and calls Jack. Learning from him that he has met someone, she accuses him of having had an affair during their marriage.  Judy and Gabe are introduced to Jack's new girlfriend, Sam, an aerobics trainer. While Judy and Sam shop, Gabe calls Jack's new girlfriend a "cocktail waitress" and tells him that he is crazy for leaving Sally for her. About a week later, Judy introduces Sally to Michael (Neeson), Judy's magazine colleague who she clearly is interested in herself. Michael asks Sally out, and they begin dating; Michael is smitten, but Sally is dissatisfied with the relationship.  Meanwhile, Gabe has developed a friendship with a young student of his, Rain, and has her read the manuscript of his novel. She comments on its brilliance, but has several criticisms, to which Gabe reacts defensively.  At a party, Jack learns from a friend that Sally is seeing someone, and flies into a jealous rage. He and Sam break up after an intense argument, and Jack drives back to his house to find Sally in bed with Michael. He asks Sally to give their marriage another chance, but she tells him to leave.  Less than two weeks later, however, Jack and Sally are back together and the couple meet Judy and Gabe for dinner like old times. After dinner, Judy and Gabe get into an argument about her not sharing her poetry. After Gabe makes a failed pass at her, Judy tells him she thinks the relationship is over; a week later Gabe moves out. Judy begins seeing Michael.  Gabe goes to Rain's 21st birthday party, and gives her a music box as a present. She asks him to kiss her, and though the two share a romantic moment, Gabe tells her they should not pursue it any further. As he walks home in the rain, he realizes that he has ruined his relationship with Judy.  Michael tells Judy he needs time alone, then says he can't help still having feelings for Sally. Angry and hurt, Judy walks out into the rain. Highlighting her "passive aggressiveness," Michael follows and begs her to stay with him. A year and a half later they marry.  At the end, the audience sees a pensive Jack and Sally back together. Jack and Sally admit their marital problems still exist (her frigidity is not solved), but they find they accept their problems as simply the price they have to pay to remain together.  Gabe is living alone because he says he is not dating for the time being, as he does not want to hurt anyone. The film ends with an immediate cut to black after Gabe asks the unseen documentary crew, "Can I go? Is this over?"

After building his dream house for himself and his longtime girlfriend Becky ([[Dana Delany]]) in his hometown, he is crushed when she refuses to marry him. He is unable to bring himself to live in the house, and leaves it abandoned and with a debt he cannot afford. Some time later, Newton meets a waitress named Gwen ([[Goldie Hawn]]) at a Hungarian restaurant in [[Boston]]. Believing that she cannot speak English, he spills out his sob story about Becky and the abandoned house. After the restaurant closes for the night, Newton learns she merely pretended to be [[Hungary|Hungarian]], and can speak English. He walks her home, which turns out to be a small apartment upstairs at the restaurant. They end up sleeping together.  The next morning, Gwen finds that Newton left in the middle of the night. However, he unintentionally left behind the drawing of the house he'd built for Becky. Interest piqued by the drawing, Gwen takes a bus ride out to see the house. She is charmed by it, and decides to move in. Gwen goes to the town's general store, where she charges her groceries to the "Newton Davis" account. When questioned about this, Gwen, who it becomes clear is a natural liar, says that she is Newton's wife. Gwen meets Becky, and spins a lengthy romantic story about how they fell in love, which surprises and impresses Becky. Gwen also meets Newton's parents, who are heartbroken that Newton got "married" without telling them, but Gwen manages to smooth things over with them with her charm.  Soon after, Newton travels to his hometown and is shocked to see that his house is lived in. When he finds out what Gwen has done he is initially furious, but he soon sees the potential in her being there. Gwen starts creating all sorts of opportunities for Newton: mending his relationship with his parents, helping out with his career by befriending Newton's boss and highlighting his long-ignored talent, and making Becky jealous. Newton and Gwen come to an agreement in which Gwen will help Newton win Becky, and in return she'll get all the furniture in the house. Through their time together, Newton begins to rely more on Gwen beyond their agreement, and Gwen starts to feel attached to her life with Newton. It is also revealed that Gwen became a compulsive liar in order to escape from what she feels is her own inadequate background, and that she has "changed" her life numerous times.  The film culminates with a reception held at the house in which the sub-plots of Newton's career, family and affections for Becky are brought together. Annoyed with Becky for her superior and suspicious attitude, Gwen confronts her in front of everyone, accusing her of trying to win Newton back. Gwen storms out of the house in tears, and Newton follows her, thinking it is still part of the plan. Outside alone, Newton praises Gwen for her brilliance, but Gwen replies that she wanted their marriage to work. Her feelings for him are apparent. Newton watches, confused, as Gwen leaves. Becky takes the opportunity to make a move on Newton, and asks whether all of Gwen's elaborate stories were real. Newton answers that they were all true and chases after Gwen.  Newton stops Gwen as she is about to board a bus to leave town. Although she resists, Newton follows her example and begins telling an outlandish romantic story of something they "did", which makes Gwen decide to stay. The film ends on the note of Newton and Gwen being happily married and living together in the house. As Newton and Gwen go into the house to have sex, the final spoken words are of Newton saying "I love you, Gwen" and Gwen replying, "Actually, it's Jessica."

If They Tell You I Fell
 In the post [[Spanish Civil War]] years, [[Catalan people|Catalan]] kids would sit in circles among the ruins and tell stories, known as "aventis" open-ended narratives drifting back and forth through time. Laced with horror and perversity, these tales mix war stories, local gossip, comic book characters, fantasy and real events. The "aventis" of this film are told in flashback in 1970, 1940, 1936 and the mid-1980s.  In 1970, Nito, a medical examiner assistant and sister Paulina, a nurse-nun (who grew up together, and now are co-workers in a hospital) identify the corpse of a couple who had drowned during a car accident. The dead man is Daniel Javaloyes "Java", one of the main characters of the "aventis" of their childhood and adolescence. The woman seems to be Juanita, who forty years before was one of many orphans. The discovery of Java’s body (long presumed dead) leads them to remember what had happened decades before. Flashbacks reveal a story that may or may not have happened.  In the old quarter of 1940s Barcelona inhabitants are struggling to survive among the ruins left by the Spanish Civil War. Daniel Javaloyes, "Java" is one of them.  He is a young man trying by any means to leave behind the misery around him. He lives in a dilapidated house with his grandmother, a mute trapper. To make some money, the hardened Java performs perverse sexual acts for the voyeuristic pleasure of Don Conrado, a rich sadistic man, who uses a wheelchair after being wounded during the war. In one of those sexual encounters for hire, Java has violent sex with Ramona, a visibly pregnant prostitute. From then on Java is smitten with the fallen woman. Initially he finds out very little about her, but when Conrado’s mother visits him also looking for her, Java learns that Ramona had been a maid in Don Conrado’s household. She bears a scarred left nipple caused by his sadism.  Marcos, Java’s older brother, was an anarchist during the war and now is hiding on the grounds of the family’s house. He yearns to see his girlfriend, Aurora Nin, again, whose identity would be blended with Ramona’s in the stories told by Sarnita, one of the kids in Java’s neighborhood. Sarnita entertains his friends telling them aventis, mixing real events with others that have been invented. Aurora Nin and Java are prominent figures in those stories.  Meanwhile, the perverse Don Conrado is directing a religious amateur play about the sacrifice of a Christian martyr. Fueguiña, one of the orphans in the institution where Paulina works, plays the leading role. Java wants to be an actor and blackmails Fueguiña in order to take the part of the devil in the play. Reluctantly Conrado allows him to participate, at least during rehearsals.  Flash back to 1936. During the war, Marcos, fighting for the Republic, takes revenge on Don Conrado’s brutality towards his girlfriend Aurora Nin. When the men under Marco’s command do not find Conrado, they kill Conrado’s father instead. Conrado’s mother barely escapes with her life thanks to Aurora’s intervention.  In one of his sexual assignments for Conrado, Java has a young man as a sexual partner instead of a woman. He does not back down, but knowing that Ado, the teenager, has been paid twice as much, he follows him to get a bigger share of the money. Through Ado, Java gets involved with a rich jewelry dealer. In him, Java sees the opportunity to escape his poverty-restricted life.  In 1940, Marcos’ old cronies from the war are also looking for him. Still trying secret anti-government plots, they have resorted mainly to criminal activities. Palau, the leader of the gang has chosen his target: Menchu, a bleach blonde prostitute who works for the elite Falangist of the city. To strike them back, Palau and his partners Fusam and Sendra attack Menchu, brutally killing her. When his pursuit of Ramona proves aimless, Java, now sure that Ramona is in fact Aurora Nin, leads Ramona to Marcos’s secret hiding place and the former lovers are happily reunited. Taking advantage of a commotion in the neighborhood Marcos and Ramona managed to escape the city.  In modern day Barcelona, by the mid-1980s, Palau, on a busy street, has a glance of an old couple asking for money. They seem to be Marcos and Aurora Nin.

Indochine (film)
 In 1930, marked by growing anticolonial unrest, Éliane Devries ([[Catherine Deneuve]]), a single woman born to French parents in colonial [[French Indochina|Indochina]], runs her and her widowed father's ([[Henri Marteau]]) large [[rubber]] [[plantation]] with many indentured laborers, whom she casually refers to as her [[coolies]], and divides her days between her homes at the plantation and outside [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]]. After her best friends from the [[Nguyễn Dynasty]] die in a plane crash, she adopts their five-year-old daughter Camille (Ba Hoang, as child). Guy Asselin (Jean Yanne), the head of the French security services in Indochina, courts Éliane, but she rejects him and raises Camille alone giving her the education of a privileged European through her teens.  Just after Éliane wins a wager against the naval commander's (Gérard Lartigau) eight- man rowing crew, she finds herself bidding against a young [[French Navy]] lieutenant, Jean-Baptiste Le Guen ([[Vincent Pérez]]), on the same painting at an [[auction]]. She is flustered when he challenges her publicly and surprised when he turns up at her plantation days later, searching for the boy whose [[sampan]] he set ablaze for suspicion of [[opium]] smuggling. Soon they are enveloped in a torrid affair.  Out and about in the city, Jean-Baptiste witnesses the escape and shooting of a Vietnamese prisoner by a French police officer. Camille ([[Linh Dan Pham|Linh Đan Phạm]], as teen and adult) and her classmates are walking nearby, and as the prisoner falls, he knocks her unconscious, leaving her covered with his blood. Jean-Baptiste brings her indoors and cleans off the blood, cutting off her dress in the process and exposing her bosom. Camille wakes up in his arms and falls in love with him at first sight, believing that he has saved her life. Word about the "affair" gets out, and Camille is taunted at school.  Through her connections with high-ranking officials in the Navy, Éliane has Jean-Baptiste transferred to [[Haiphong]] to protect Camille from getting hurt. Jean-Baptiste confronts Éliane about this at a Christmas party at her place, and a loud spat ensues in which he slaps her on the face. As a result, instead of Haiphong, Jean-Baptiste is sent to a remote French military base on the notorious [[Hạ Long Bay|Dragon Islet]] ''(Hòn Rồng)'' in northern Indochina. On arrival, he is greeted by the outgoing commanding officer, who says the French authorities hardly pay attention to this outpost: its sole function is to gather unemployed northern Vietnamese who seek [[indenture]] on plantations in more prosperous southern Indochina.  Against her better judgment, Éliane allows Camille to become engaged to Thanh (Eric Nguyen), a young pro-[[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist]] Vietnamese expelled as a student from France because of his support for the 1930 [[Yên Bái mutiny]]. The marriage is arranged by Thanh's wealthy, merchant mother. But the day after the engagement, Thanh helps Camille leave to look for Jean-Baptiste up north.  Camille travels and reaches Dragon Islet with a Vietnamese family seeking a term of indenture in the south, but they are killed by a French naval officer. When Jean-Baptiste arrives at the scene and demands that the officer tell him what happened, the officer says that the family refused to be split up and started inciting a riot.  Jean-Baptiste spots Camille among the laborers and leads her away. The French sailors do not object thinking their superior is taking a ''congaie'', a Vietnamese mistress. As Camille sees her traveling companions dead, she attacks the French officer shooting him in the struggle. This puts a price on the heads of both Camille and Jean-Baptiste, who stands by her.  Camille and Jean-Baptiste escape from Dragon Islet and sail away through the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] for several days without food or water. When they come ashore, a Communist theater troupe rescues them and takes them to a hard-to-reach valley where the two find refuge in a large complex of buildings. After several months have passed, and Camille has become pregnant with Jean-Baptiste's child, they are told they must leave the valley, because the Communists have more important people to hide. Thanh, now a high-ranking Communist operative, arranges for the theater troupe to smuggle the lovers into China.  Guy attempts to use operatives to put down the growing insurrection and also arranges for French agents to look for Camille and Jean-Baptiste in the north. They look up and down the Gulf of Tonkin with no success.  Guy figures out that traveling theater troupes may be behind many near-simultaneous insurrections in the north. He orders all theater troupes traveling along certain routes to be arrested. The troupes have brought attention to themselves, among other things, through [[tuồng]] performances by Vietnamese actors with white make-up starring as Jean-Baptiste rescuing Camille, popularly nicknamed "the Red Princess".  When the lovers are a few kilometers from the Chinese border, Jean-Baptiste takes his and Camille's newborn son Étienne (Nguyen Tran Quang Johnny, as baby) to [[baptize]] him in the river while she is sleeping. He finishes the ceremony only to see several French soldiers with their rifles aimed at him. Her lover and son captured, Camille escapes with the theater troupe, while the French authorities remand Jean-Baptiste to a Saigon jail and give Étienne to Éliane.  Jean-Baptiste spends time in prison and does not speak with anyone. He agrees to talk eventually if he can first see his son. The Navy (which has authority over the case and refuses to subject Jean-Baptiste to interrogation by the police) plans to court-martial Jean-Baptiste in [[Brest, France]] to avoid the public outcry that would likely arise from a trial in Indochina. Jean-Baptiste is allowed to be with Étienne for 24 hours and settle his affairs before leaving for France. He goes to see Éliane, who lets him stay with Étienne at her Saigon residence for the night.  The next day, when Éliane arrives at the house to pick Étienne up, she finds Jean-Baptiste dead, lying in bed with a shot in the temple and a gun in hand. Étienne is safe in the bed next to him. Éliane, outraged, tells Guy that she suspects the police, but Guy's girlfriend tells Éliane that the Communists probably killed Jean-Baptiste to silence him. With no evidence sought for either suspicion, Jean-Baptiste's death is ruled a suicide.  Camille is captured and sent to [[Côn Đảo Prison|Poulo-Condor]] - a high security prison that does not permit visitors, and not even Guy can free her. He confides to Éliane that Camille's only chance for surviving the prison is to become a dedicated Communist. Éliane lobbies government officials for Camille's release to no avail. After five years, the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] comes to power and releases all political prisoners, including Camille. Éliane goes to the prison to take her home but, rather than go and live with her mother and son, Camille joins the Communists to [[First Indochina War|fight for Vietnam's independence]]. She does not wish for her son to know the horrors she has witnessed, and tells her mother that French colonialism is drawing to an end.  Éliane sells her plantation to Thanh's mother and leaves her home in Indochina, the land of her birth, with Étienne to live in France.  Years later, Éliane tells a grown-up Étienne (Jean-Baptiste Huynh) the story of his mother and takes him to [[Switzerland]], where Camille is a [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Vietnam Communist Party]] delegate to the [[1954 Geneva Conference]]. Étienne goes to the negotiators' hotel, but he realizes the futility of attempting to find his mother in the crowds of people. He waits in the lobby, foolishly hoping that Camille will see him and call out to him, recognizing him as her son, but this does not happen. He recounts this to Éliane and tells her that she, Éliane, is his mother.  As the film concludes, an epilogue notes that, the next day, French Indochina becomes independent from France and [[partition of Vietnam|Vietnam is partitioned]] into [[North Vietnam|North]] and [[South Vietnam]] (leading, eventually, to the [[Vietnam War]]).

They chase Salvatore out onto the street, where he causes a collision between a taxi and a bus. Gennaro kills him by igniting him with the leaking gas tank of the bus and then shooting him in the head. Marie can no longer handle being the monster she is, and attempts to commit [[suicide]] by the sunlight, stating that she "died a long time ago". Gennaro talks her out of it, telling her that he loves her. Gennaro books her into a nearby hotel, and Marie states in a voiceover that he "made [her] feel alive".

Ironheart
  Ironheart opens at a [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] nightclub (Upfront FX), where Milverstead, who is considered the most powerful and ruthless man in town, and his group of thugs are looking at the female clientele with an approving eye.  Milverstead is shipping illegal arms out of the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] docks, and to sweeten the deals with his trading partners, he kidnaps local lonely dancers, strings them out on [[heroin]], and sends them along in the deal.  He notices Cindy Kane ([[Meagan Hughes]]) dancing furiously to [[U-Krew]]'s hit "If You Were Mine" and decides to kidnap her.  To lure her into his trap, he instructs his young lieutenant Richard ([[Michael Lowry]]) to flirt with her and get her to go with him.  Cindy is ostensibly with her loser boyfriend Stevo ([[Rob Buckmaster]]) at the club, but wants to get him jealous and so leaves with Richard.  Milverstead and his gang leave shortly thereafter.  However, they are being tailed from the club by a new policeman on the Portland force from LA named Douglas ([[David Mountain]]),  Douglas has been tipped to Milverstead's shady dealings and follows everyone to the docks, where most of the gang is now dragging Cindy onto a boat, locking her in a cage and shooting her full of heroin.   At this point, Milverstead's second in command, Ice ([[Bolo Yeung]]) takes some of the gang and lays a trap for Douglas.  They beat Douglas senseless, at which point Ice shoots Douglas in cold blood on a pile of old tires, and also blows up his car with gunfire.  Back in LA, Douglas's old partner John Keem ([[Britton K. Lee]]) is made aware of his partner's untimely death and strangely ordered to Portland to assist the local police in the investigation.  While driving to Portland in a red convertible Porsche, he stops for a sandwich when he notices some men on the beach smoking marijuana and, subsequently, attempting to rape a female jogger.  He goes to investigate when he is charged by a drugged out rapist named Spike, and promptly beats him and the rest of the potential rapists up, saving the jogger's life.  When he goes to check on the woman, she has fled in terror from the bizarre encounter.  Upon reaching Portland, he immediately goes to meet with Captain Kronious ([[Joe Ivy]]), who offers assistance and mentions that a woman also disappeared the same night Douglas was killed, a Cindy Kane.  John goes to talk to Stevo and see if there is perhaps a connection between Cindy's disappearance and Douglas's fateful death.  Milverstead arranges to have Cindy sent overseas with his next shipment, and brags to Ice how pleased he is things are going so smoothly, as he HATES chaos.  John Keem meets up Stevo, who tells him Cindy left with a strange guy from the club, so they go to investigate that night.  Milverstead is there along with his gang, so John Keem stirs things up a bit by starting a fight to get Milverstead's attention when he sees a friend of Cindy named Kristy ([[Karman Kruschke]]) being harassed by a couple young punks.  Puzzled that Ice has never heard of this new heavy hitter, he sets about to find out who exactly John Keem is.  Kristy runs a dance studio, so John Keem decides to pay her a visit the next day and question her about Cindy.  Cindy, unfortunately, became a "tragic dancer's story", where she was talented, but got lazy and started simply dancing at the clubs trying to land a rich guy, leading Stevo on the whole time that he had an actual chance with her.  They go to lunch, where they are interrupted by Stevo (whom Kristy calls "Cherub") who tells John Keem to check out an address given to him by the Captain.  John races off to follow the tip, leaving Stevo to awkwardly hit on Kristy just one day after his girlfriend goes missing.  John finds the address, but when he gets closer to the house to investigate, he sees a bomb planted just inside the window by Milverstead's henchman Simmons ([[Pat Patterson (actor)|Pat Patterson]]) and runs away just as it explodes.  Simmons and his accomplices try to corner John, and they then engage in a wild gun battle where two of the gang are killed and Simmons wings John Keem in the shoulder.  At this moment, Kristy arrives out of nowhere in an old [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and just drives through the middle of the battle, allowing Simmons to escape.  Kristy jumps out of her car and gets in a shouting match with John, who calms her down and blows up her car so it can't be traced.  They drive off together to continue the hunt.  Back on Milverstead's [[boat]], he is relaxing with a drink Ice just made when Simmons arrives.  He quizzes Simmons about whether or not John Kim was dead, and makes him feel guilty about botching the operation so badly.  Simmons sputters out some nonsense about knowing that he shot John Keem, but refuses to answer whether or not he terminated the target.  Disgusted, Milverstead tells Simmons the dead men's blood scream for his, so he has Ice strangle Simmons with his own tie and toss him overboard.  Kristy attends to John Keem's wounds back at her place, when she starts to get emotional.  Unmoved, John Keem listens and then they promptly sleep together with no apparent pre-text other than they were both there.  Stevo is frantically trying to reach John Keem, so he calls Kronious to let him know that Richard, the guy Cindy went home with, works for Milverstead.  He then goes off to complete his route for Hot Flash Pizza.  However, Captain Kronious calls Milverstead with this information, and not John Keem.  Milverstead gets off the phone and asks Ice, who has been bouncing a pencil while awaiting his next order, if he'd like a little "exercise".  Ice throws down the pencil and goes off to find and kill Stevo.  After their [[Human sexuality|sexual]] encounter, John Keem goes off to finish the investigation while Kristy goes to collect her 8 year old [[daughter]] she left at the club with the reception several hours earlier.  John Keem learns that Stevo has been killed, and makes the connection that Milverstead is involved.  He takes the fight to Milverstead by impersonating a homeless man and banging on the door to Milverstead Shipping in downtown [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] to alert the night watchman.  They let him in, and he promptly kills or maims the entire security team and finds evidence to finish Milverstead once and for all.  Milverstead is waiting for him at the club, and offers a bonus to any of his henchman who kills John Keem.  Kristy leaves her daughter at home alone again to try and lure Milverstead out into the open by dancing up a storm at the dance club.  Milverstead knows she is working with John Kim, but decides to kidnap her and send her overseas anyway to punish her for working with him.  Unfortunatetly, John Keem dispatches his henchman with a single punch and quickly follows Milverstead and Ice to the docks.  There he also finds the double-crossing Captain Kronious, and gets him to tell him where Milverstead is before he shoots and kills him.  He then kills off the remaining henchman (besides Ice) and corners a helpless Milverstead.  Wielding a [[samurai]] sword he took off one of the henchman, he chops a sobbing Milverstead's head off and turns to face Ice.  He quickly beats (but does not kill) Ice, avenging his friend's death.  He goes back to LA with Kristy and her daughter to start a new chapter of his life.

Invader (film)
 In the opening sequence, four airmen from Clark Air Base in Washington D.C. frantically attempt to escape the base. A contingent of soldiers soon blocks their path. Most of the escapees are shot, but one sees a flying saucer which burns him to a crisp with its energy weapon.  Frank Mccall ([[Hans Bachmann]]) is an overqualified [[photojournalist]] writing about two-headed dogs and alien abductions for the sleazy ''National Scandal'' tabloid. When the airman's charred corpse is found, he is assigned to the story. When government agents try to keep him out, he resolves to sneak into the airbase, where a top-secret [[fighter plane]] is to be demoed that night. The plane is equipped with an experimental software system called A.S.M.O.D.S, which suddenly malfunctions mid-demo, crashing the plane. As the disappointed top brass go home, Mccall is intercepted by Captain Anders (A. Thomas Smith), who orders him taken into custody and his camera seized.  Sinister [[men in black]] wrench Mccall away, taking him to a storage compartment to be injected with a glowing green substance and brainwashed with an electronic apparatus. Anders and Colonel Faraday (Rick Foucheux) arrive in time to stop them, and the men shoot themselves. Anders takes Mccall into custody himself, while Faraday returns to the base. Suddenly, the flying saucer from the opening appears. Anders shoots it, to no effect, while Mccall photographs it with his backup [[disc film|disc camera]]. Powerless against the invader, they drive away, dodging more men in black on the way, and lock themselves in the base.  Mccall's camera is again confiscated, its photos to be developed as evidence. Mccall manages to secure the prints, and also spies on Anders conversing with the General. He thus finds out that the A.S.M.O.D.S. system uses alien technology recovered from a crashed spaceship in the New Mexico desert, and this technology seems to have a mind of its own. The men in black break their way in, so Mccall escapes with Anders in the [[F-117|F-117 stealth fighter]]. They have a brief dogfight with some [[F-16]]s out of Clark, which ends when they manage to secure air support from the Pentagon.  Mccall and Anders are questioned, and eventually manage to convince General Anheiser (John Cook) that A.S.M.O.D.S. has taken over the base computers using the intranet, and brainwashed all of the soldiers into its control. They agree to go investigate the next day. In between time, Mccall quits his job at the ''Scandal'', realizing he is onto the story of the century.  At the airbase, the trio is greeted by a now-brainwashed Faraday. His troops destroy their helicopter escort, and he takes them down to the subbasement, which has been excavated into a gaping cavern. There Faraday reveals the alien's plan: it cannibalized the base hardware to build a giant robot, HARV, with which to conquer the world after [[nuclear weapon|nuking]] China and Russia. Mccall realizes that just as the alien programming seeped into A.S.M.O.D.S., so A.S.M.O.D.S. has seeped into the alien, arming it with a nationalistic impulse to destroy America's enemies.  The protagonists manage to shoot Faraday's guards. HARV tries to stop them, but only succeeds in killing Faraday. They search the basement for weapons with which to destroy HARV and avert [[World War III]]. They find a rocket launcher and two rockets; their first attempt misses, but the second is a direct hit, with one second to spare before HARV would launch the missiles. The ending sequence shows several newspapers honoring Mccall for his heroics, while the ''National Scandal'' claims the alien invasion was a hoax.

Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar
  The movie is set in [[Dehradun]], [[India]]. The movie opens with the description of the various colleges in the city. The Rajput college has students from affluent backgrounds with each student being an heir to a multimillion-dollar fortune. In contrast, the Model college has students from poor local households. Other colleges include Xaviers College and Queens College, the latter being an all-girls college with the guys from all three colleges trying to woo the students there.  The highlight of the town is the annual inter-college sports championship with a marathon cycle race as the prime event. In the beginning of the film, the race is contested between Ratan Lal Sharma ([[Mamik Singh]]) of Model College and Shekhar Malhotra ([[Deepak Tijori]]) of Rajput College with the latter winning the race because Ratan had an inferior bike. After the race, both are felicitated by their respective schools for which Shekhar becomes cocky and arrogant.  Sanju ([[Aamir Khan]]) is Ratan's younger brother and is everything that Ratan is not. He's a carefree youngster who is full of himself and is always in trouble with his father Ramlal ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]), who wants him to act more maturely and become responsible like Ratan. Sanju and his little gang, which includes Anjali ([[Ayesha Jhulka]]) (who has a crush on Sanju), bunk sports to smoke cigarettes and roam around town. Anjali and her dad run a vehicle repair shop and Anjali's father asks his daughter to stay away from Sanju.  Ramlal and his family run a small cafe which is the hangout spot for most of the college students. A number of scuffles occur between Sanju and Shekhar because of Shekhar's attempts to humiliate Ratan and his dad. Enter Devika ([[Pooja Bedi]]), who immediately catches the fancy of both Sanju and Shekhar. Initially, she leans towards Shekhar but one day she misses her bus on the way to a picnic to meet Shekhar. Meanwhile, Sanju asks Anjali for a car so that he can roam around town. While on his way he spots Devika and leaves his friends at the paan shop and gives Devika a lift. Devika upon reaching her destination finds Shekhar with another girl and goes along with Sanju who, although not rich, brags about his wealth for being student from Xavier School.  Sanju's lie is ultimately revealed when Devika sees him dancing in the Model College group during a dance competition. After the show, Sanju and Devika break up that evening and in a heated argument, Sanju fights with Shekhar's friends. Sanju is almost overpowered when his brother intervenes and chases Shekhar's friends away. Ramlal asks Sanju for the money he had given him to deposit in the bank (which he spent on Devika) which leads to a heated argument between Sanju and his dad & Sanju gets thrown out of the house.  Next morning, Ramlal leaves for town. Ratan tells Sanju that his Dad has forgiven him and asked him to return home, which Sanju tries to ignores. A heated argument and fight ensue between Ratan and Shekhar, which ends with Ratan accidentally falling off a cliff. While Ratan is in hospital, Sanju recollects his childhood with Ratan. When his father returns, he reconciles with him. With Ratan in the hospital, Sanju becomes more responsible and starts to care for his father and bed ridden brother. He decides that he will participate in the race with the help of Anjali and give it his best for Ratan. During his training, he realises his true feelings for Anjali and Sanju fall in for Anjali.  A day before the race, Sanju finds out about the real cause of the accident and confronts Ratan who tells him that he didn't say anything about the accident because Sanju had become responsible and closer to all of them. Ratan asks Sanju to give his best in the race if he really love his brother Ratan.  With his new cycle, Sanju participates in the race. The race begins evenly with both Sanju and Shekhar going head to head. Somewhere in the middle, the two fall and a scuffle ensues between Sanju and Shekhar and his friends. During this, other cyclists take the lead. Shekhar heads back on track with his friends holding Sanju back. Sanju breaks free from Shekhar's friends and joins the race, catching up with Shekhar during the final laps of the race and finally beating him in the closing moments, giving Model College, his father and brother their long-awaited victory.  
Jennifer 8
 Former [[Los Angeles]] policeman John Berlin is teetering toward burnout after the collapse of his marriage. At the invitation of an old friend and colleague, Freddy Ross, Berlin heads to rural northern [[California]], for a job with the [[Eureka, California|Eureka]] police force. Instead, Berlin prickles his new colleagues, especially John Taylor, who was passed over for promotion in order to make room for Berlin.  After finding a woman's severed hand in a garbage bag at the local dump, Berlin reopens the case of an unidentified murdered girl, nicknamed "Jennifer", which went unsolved despite a full-time six-month effort by the department. Berlin notes an unusually large number of scars on the hand as well as wear on the finger-tips which he realizes came from reading [[Braille]], determining that the girl is blind. He begins to believe the cases are related. Berlin does his best to convince Freddy and his fellow officers of his suspicions, but Taylor, and police chief Citrine, refuse to believe that the hand found at the dump is in any way connected to the other cases.  After consulting his former colleagues in L.A., Berlin discovers that in the previous four years, six women, most of them blind, have either been found dead or are still missing, all within a 300-mile radius of San Diego. He becomes convinced that "Jennifer" was the 7th victim and the girl whose hand was found at the dump is "Jennifer 8", or victim #8. While investigating the links between the dead and missing blind girls, he meets blind music student Helena Robertson, determining that her roommate Amber was the eighth victim. Berlin becomes obsessed with the case, despite an almost complete lack of hard evidence, and becomes romantically involved with Helena, who resembles his ex-wife.  After an attack on Helena, Ross accompanies Berlin on a stakeout at the institute where Helena lives in a dorm, after leaving Helena with Ross' wife Margie. When they see a flashlight shining on the same floor as Helena's apartment, Berlin investigates and is knocked unconscious by the killer, who then shoots and kills Ross with Berlin's .32 pistol. A grueling interrogation of Berlin by [[FBI]] special agent St. Anne ensues. St. Anne makes clear to Berlin that he figures him for Ross's murderer, but also inadvertently reveals information which helps Berlin realize that Sgt. Taylor is the true killer. Berlin tells St. Anne and Citrine who he believes the killer to be, but his deductions are met with disbelief. Berlin is arrested for Ross's murder, but is bailed out by Margie, who believes that Berlin is not the killer.  Upon making bail Berlin returns to Margie's house only to learn that Margie has taken Helena back to the institute. Fearing that Helena and Margie are in danger, Berlin rushes to the institute, but fails to arrive ahead of Taylor, who breaks in and chases a woman he believes to be Helena through the dorm. Finally catching up to her, he is shocked to discover that the woman he'd been pursuing is actually Margie, who shoots him dead, avenging her husband and closing the case.

Though Meenakshi is enamored towards Vishwanath, she fears that she is too poor to join the ranks of Jodidars. However, Vishwanath's father is more than satisfied with his son's choice and accepts the marriage proposal. Meenakshi and Vishwanath get married. Vishwanath takes over the mantle of Jodidar of Simhaadri and other 8 villages from his father and tries to improve the lives of the people of his 8 villages.

The elder son, a doctor, falls for his classmate, the daughter of a liquor baron ([[Thoogudeepa Srinivas]]), who had been thrown out of the village by Vishwanath for brewing illicit liquor during their younger days.

However, Toogudeepa berates him for his short-sightedness in presuming that his well-educated and sophisticated daughter-in-law would stay back in a lowly village. Vishwanath is firm, and he insists that if Toogudeepa's daughter is to marry his son, she will have to stay with her husband in their village.  Toogudeepa walks away threatening Gurudutt that he can choose either his father's village or his love. Gurudutt fights with his father and leaves home. This comes as the first blow to Vishwanatha Raya.  Abhijit, the second son, gets married but his wife is not very happy staying in the village and serving her in-laws.

The 3 sons, who have by now become addicted to sloth and a luxurious lifestyle, even throw their granny out.  Vishwanath returns, only to find his home turned from a temple to a tavern. He single-handedly beats the daylights out of drunkards gathered over there and questions his sons about his mother. Learning that she is passing days in a lonely hut, he visits his mother.  Pandari Bhai is filled with joy to find her son alive. She pleads his son to take cudgels against the liquor baron Toogudeepa. Life comes a full-circle to Vishwanath. He once again starts the task of fighting liquor racket, gambling, and other evils.

While in the forest, Vikram is warned by a tribesman named Bheema ([[Mushtaq Khan]]), who tries to persuade him to go back home, stating that the night of the full moon is the cursed tiger's night to hunt. Vikram laughs it off and decided to go after the tiger, not believing that this tiger is the cursed tiger. Arun finds something fishy and asks Vikram to go back. Suddenly it starts raining and the duo have to find a place to stay. Some strange voices were heard by the duo and they find the voices were coming from a den, but as the duo have to find a place to stay in, they decided to enter the den.   Within the den, Arun discovers writings on the walls in Sanskrit. These writings describe the tale of a king who could not have a child. One day, a tantric told him if he caught a pair of tigers who were in love, and on a full moon night, to kill one tiger and drink his blood, the king could have a child. The king did everything he was told, but when he killed one tiger, the surviving mate cursed him. The curse transformed the king into a tiger each full moon night and he hunted man. The curse also entailed that anybody who killed the king when he was in the tiger's form would in turn get cursed and so the curse would carry on forever. Vikram berates his friend for believing an age-old myth and they are then attacked by the cursed tiger. Vikram tries to shoot the tiger, but he missed the shot, Arun is killed on the spot by the tiger and Vikram becomes very scared. The shot fired by Vikram hits the fire lamp and a chain of fire was built in the den, the tiger hides due to this, but the tiger roars from somewhere. Vikram was unable to find the tiger. Scared, Vikram fired shots everywhere in the den with the hope that the tiger will run away, but the tiger attacks Vikram and Vikram fell in the ring of fire. The tiger did not again attack Vikram as tigers are afraid of fire and the tiger disappears.  The shots fired by Vikram are heard by Harry ([[Tom Alter]]) and the Forest Officer Bhaskar Inamdar (Homi Wadia), who rush to the spot. There they find Bheema attacking Vikram to kill him. He claims that Vikram has gotten cursed and if he is killed before the curse reaches him, it will save him from a cursed life. Harry and Bhaskar, however, transfer Vikram to a hospital in an attempt to save his life.  Later on in the hospital, Vikram's hopes of survival are minimal and he is confirmed dead. The spirit of the tiger then enters Vikram and he returns from the dead, much to the shock and amazement of the doctors. Vikram is treated by Dr. Nita ([[Pooja Bhatt]]) and he begins to like her. As the days go by, Vikram realises that there is an evil present in him. His dead friend's spirit tells him about the cursed tiger and that he himself will become the same beast on the upcoming full moon and every full moon thereafter. His friend also tells Vikram to kill himself, but Vikram refuses.  Vikram's liking for Dr. Nita turns into an obsession after he comes to know that she is in love with an up-and-coming singer, Ravi ([[Avinash Wadhawan]]). The evil in Vikram comes forward and he plots to separate Nita and Ravi. Then he consoles and convinces Nita's father to allow him to marry Nita. The night of their marriage is the night of the full moon, and that night Vikram transforms into a tiger in the hotel and kills an unknown woman. The following nights, Vikram's hunting spree continues as he kills more people after transforming into a tiger. The case of these murders is handled by Inspector Sudhir Pai ([[Avtar Gill]]), who enlists Forest Officer Bhaskar's assistance, since the victims resemble victims of animal attacks. Bhaskar begins suspecting Vikram after he finds direct and indirect evidences of his presence at each scene of crime, but is unable to gather enough evidence against Vikram to have him arrested.  Bheema approaches Bhaskar and Ravi and warns them of the danger that Nita is in, being Vikram's wife. Ravi tries to talk Nita into leaving Vikram for fear of her being harmed, but is berated by her. Ravi approaches Inspector Sudhir asking him to imprison Vikram on suspicion of the murders, but the Inspector berates Ravi for making unfounded allegations. Requiring evidence against Vikram, Bhaskar, Bheema and Ravi head over to Vikram's home. Meanwhile, Vikram's disappearances each night and Ravi's allegations against Vikram make Nita suspicious of Vikram and she decides to keep him at home. As soon as the moon is out, Vikram transforms into a tiger and tries to kill Nita, but she manages to escape and runs into Ravi, who has come to save her along with Bheema and Bhaskar. She tells them of how she saw Vikram transform into a tiger and based upon Bheema's suggestion, they build a ring of fire around themselves, since tigers are afraid of fire and Vikram won't attack them due to this. Vikram, in the form of the tiger, approaches them, but is unable to cross into their little circle of fire and moves away.  Bhaskar offers to bring the car around so that they can leave for safety. He takes a firebrand from the inferno and heads towards the car. Unbeknownst to them, Vikram is hiding inside the car lying in wait. He pulls Bhaskar inside the car and kills him as the group watches in horror.  The group then approaches Harry asking for a way to kill Vikram and end the curse. Harry combs through ancient manuscripts and finds a way that involves locating an ancient temple within the mountains that contains an enchanted dagger that can kill the beast and end the curse. As soon as they leave for the mountain, Vikram approaches Harry. Harry attempts to kill Vikram with his gun, but discovers that normal weapons have no effect on him. Vikram, in his human form, proceeds to kill Harry, but manages to learn about the dagger and that Ravi, Nita and Bheema are on their way to find this dagger.  At the mountain, the group locates a cave. Bheema is too scared to enter the cave and opts to stay out and wait. After a while, Vikram reaches the mountain and promises to spare Bheema if he reveals the location of the cave to him. When Bheema points towards the cave, Vikram throws him over the mountain and heads towards the cave.  Within the cave, Ravi and Nita are dismayed to discover that there is not one but a row of daggers, only one of which is the right dagger. They read through the manuscript that was given to them by Harry and discover that the setting sun will point towards the right dagger. At sunset, a magical ray enters the cave and enlightens the enchanted dagger. Ravi is overjoyed to see the dagger, but when he claims it, he discovers that Vikram has entered the cave and taken Nita hostage. Vikram offers to exchange Nita with Ravi for the dagger and Ravi agrees to it, but tricks Vikram and a fight ensues. The curse has made Vikram so strong that even in his human form he bests Ravi, but is interrupted before he can finish Ravi when the moon rises. While he is transforming into the tiger, Ravi gets the time to look for the dagger, but is unable to find it due to the mist in the cave. Just before Vikram can finish transforming and kill Ravi, he manages to find the dagger and stabs Vikram with it. This ends the curse as well as killing Vikram, thus bringing to an end the "Junoon" of the curse.

As per the bet, they make Kailash believe that Sheetal is kidnapped, while in reality they have housed themselves in a cottage outside Bombay belonging to Pillai ([[Johnny Lever]]).  When Raj makes the bet, he decides that Boney will pose as a kidnapper with him. Raj puts his plan into action and Kailash gets moving. Kailash panics and decides to not to alert the police. However, one of his aides smells a rat. On deciding that Sheetal has been kidnapped, Suresh is saddled with the case. Learning this, the group panics. Kailash, however, delivers the money, ignorant of the development. Raj and Boney recover the money and go to meet the ladies, who are still skeptical. Neelam sees them coming and goes to receive them. She is surprised to see the money and the trio calls Sheetal.  Sheetal arrives with a strange look on her face and collapses dead&nbsp;— revealing a knife in her back.

Sheetal's body is found and her kidnappers become prime suspects. Meanwhile, some strange developments are taking place: a dancer named Julie ([[Kunika]]) blackmails Kailash. It is revealed that Julie is a well-known dancer, but has been blackmailing Kailash for quite some time.  She asks a hefty amount; Kailash refuses. She threatens him and tells him to attend a dance show she has arranged. There, Kailash is supposed to give her the money as a prize. Neelam gets a pleasant surprise when her uncle shows up to see how she is doing. Coincidentally, he is going to attend the function too. Raj and Boney decide to participate. On learning about Julie's meeting with Kailash, Suresh thinks that there is more to the case than it appears. Boney gets on stage to dance with Julie and, in the middle of the dance, recognizes her as the woman who nearly killed them.  Realizing that those accidents were more than a coincidence, he decides to confront her after the show. After the show, Neelam goes to her hostel while Raj goes home. Meanwhile, Suresh becomes confident that the trio is involved in the case. He confronts Raj, who tells the truth. Here, Boney comes to meet Julie, only to see her dressing room door is locked. He hears some voices and peeps through a keyhole.  Julie is with a man whom Boney is unable to see. Boney's suspicion proves correct: Julie tells the man that she tried to kill the gang on his orders. She blackmails the man, too, and he kills her. At this point, Boney sees the killer and flees. The killer is alerted of Boney's presence and sends goons to kill him. Raj and Suresh try to find Boney after they realize that he is missing. Meanwhile, Boney is stabbed and about to be killed by the goons when the brothers arrive. After Raj single-handedly takes on the goons, Boney tells him that Neelam is in danger before becoming unconscious.  Raj calls Neelam and alerts her; the phone gets suddenly disconnected. He rushes to her hostel with Suresh. Neelam is alone in the hostel and is horrified to find that the watchman is already dead. Meanwhile, Raj tells the truth to Suresh. Neelam gets attacked by the killer. She doesn't get to see his face but is able to defend herself. She succeeds in throwing him out of the window, thinking that he is dead. As she is gasping for breath, the killer is revealed to be her uncle.  She is shocked. He tries to kill her. Raj and Suresh arrive in time to arrest him. While in lockup, he reveals the truth: He is not Neelam's uncle. He is the manager of her estate, who was given her custody by her dying father, as Neelam had no other living relatives. He thought that he would get at least some part of the estate as her guardian, but her father's will revealed that when she turns 18, he will lose all the estate to her. According to another clause, if she died before turning 18, he would inherit the estate.  Neelam's premature death had to be natural, not foul play. Since he couldn't risk becoming a suspect, he sent Neelam to Bombay under the guise of higher education. He hired Julie to kill the gang and to write off Neelam's death as an accident. When Julie failed, he took the matter in his own hands. On learning the gang's plan, he went to the cottage and killed Sheetal, mistaking her for Neelam. After his testimony, the gang is exonerated. Boney recovers and the gang gives Kailash his money back. Kailash forgives them, telling them to not to play such a rude prank with anyone.

So's father helps him cheat his way through the written examination, while his personal expertise in martial arts carries him through the physical tests. So eventually emerges as champion, but just as the emperor is about to grant him the title, Chiu reveals that So is illiterate, proving that he cheated in the written examination. The enraged emperor orders So's family properties and possessions to be confiscated and decrees that they shall remain as beggars for the rest of their lives.  So does not adapt well to his new life.

He stays, however, and is condemned to be hanged, accused of sedition. Before that happens, during a parlay, French general [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] shows Munro an intercepted message which states that no reinforcements have been sent. Montcalm offers to allow the British to evacuate the fort with honor, keeping their weapons. Munro has little choice but to accept. However, Magua, a French ally, is furious at this arrangement. He harbors great hatred for Munro, blaming him for past wrongs done to him and his family.   The following day, Colonel Munro, his soldiers, and their women and children leave the fort. Magua and his Huron warriors ambush them. Magua personally kills Munro. Hawkeye and the Mohicans fight their way out, leading Cora, Alice, and Heyward to temporary safety. Later, however, Magua captures the major and the women. Magua takes his prisoners to a Huron settlement and addresses its [[sachem]]. He is interrupted by Hawkeye, who comes in alone to plead for their lives.   The sachem rules that Heyward be returned to the British, Alice given to Magua, and Cora [[Execution by burning|burned alive]]. Hawkeye, for his great bravery, may leave unharmed. Hawkeye tells Heyward, who is serving as translator, to beg the sachem to let Hawkeye take Cora's place. Instead, Heyward trades his own life for Cora’s.   Once Cora and Hawkeye are far enough away, Hawkeye shoots Heyward to end his suffering. Chingachgook, Uncas, and Hawkeye then set out after Magua's party to free Alice. Uncas races ahead and engages Magua in personal combat, but is killed. Alice chooses to step off the cliff to her death rather than go to the beckoning Magua. While Hawkeye holds Magua's remaining men at bay, Chingachgook duels Magua and avenges his son. Chingachgook prays to the [[Great Spirit]] to receive Uncas, calling himself "the last of the Mohicans."  
Ladybugs (film)
 Chester Lee ([[Rodney Dangerfield]]) is desperate for a promotion at work and some respect from his boss. To impress his boss, he claims to have been a good soccer player in his youth and is badgered into coaching a girls' team called the [[Ladybug]]s. Dragging his assistant Julie ([[Jackée Harry]]) along as assistant coach, Chester figures the gig easy as the Ladybugs, sponsored by his company, are a [[dynasty (sports)|dynasty]], having dominated previous seasons. If he can get this team to a championship, he will get the promotion. Unfortunately, only one player has returned for the new season. The new team, which includes the boss's daughter, Kimberly ([[Vinessa Shaw]]), are clueless, make a dreadful start to the season and the boss is less than impressed.  In his personal life, Chester is engaged to Bess ([[Ilene Graff]]), who has a son, Matthew ([[Jonathan Brandis]]), from a previous marriage. Matthew just happens to be a great athlete, but poor grades get him kicked off the soccer team. Chester invites Matthew to watch the Ladybugs practice and to get some tips. Matthew has a crush on Kimberly from school and it is partly due to this that Chester persuades him to dress like a girl and play for the team under the name Martha. With only Chester, Matthew and Julie knowing the secret of Martha's identity, the team wins the rest of its games to get to the championship game. Kimberly makes friends with Martha, not knowing "she" is in fact Matthew.  Just before the championship game, Bess finds out that Matthew has been dressing as a girl to play. She becomes angry with Chester, making him drop Matthew from the team. Kimberly, who has not been playing well, is also dropped on the request of Chester's boss.  The Ladybugs go down 3-0 in the first half. At halftime, Matthew reveals to Kimberly and the rest of the team that he is Martha. His honesty fires the team up and with Chester's encouragement, Kimberly scores the winning goal on a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]. As the Ladybugs win the championship, Chester gets his promotion. Bess and Chester get married while Matthew and Kimberly begin dating.  Chester is now managing the company's girls softball team, where the entire team are boys dressed as girls. Chester says to the audience "I finally got some respect."

A League of Their Own
 In 1988, Dottie Hinson ([[Geena Davis]]) attends the opening of the new [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]] (AAGPBL) exhibit at the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]. She sees many of her former teammates and friends, prompting a flashback to 1943.  When [[World War II]] threatens to shut down [[Major League Baseball]], candy magnate and [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]] owner Walter Harvey ([[Garry Marshall]]) persuades his fellow owners to bankroll a women's league. Ira Lowenstein ([[David Strathairn]]) is put in charge, and Ernie Capadino ([[Jon Lovitz]]) is sent out to recruit players. Capadino attends an industrial-league softball game in rural [[Oregon]] and likes what he sees in Dottie, the catcher for a local dairy's team. Dottie turns down Capadino's offer, happy with her simple farm life while waiting for her husband Bob ([[Bill Pullman]]) to come back from the war. Her sister and teammate, Kit ([[Lori Petty]]), however, is desperate to get away and make something of herself. Capadino is not impressed by Kit's hitting performance, but agrees to take her along if she can change Dottie's mind. Dottie agrees, but only for her sister's sake.  Dottie and Kit head out to [[Wrigley Field|Harvey Field]] in [[Chicago]] for the tryout. There they meet a pair of New Yorkers, [[taxi dancer]] "All the Way" Mae Mordabito ([[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]) and her best friend, bouncer Doris Murphy ([[Rosie O'Donnell]]), along with soft-spoken right fielder Evelyn Gardner ([[Bitty Schram]]), illiterate, shy left fielder Shirley Baker ([[Ann Cusack]]), pitcher/shortstop and former Miss Georgia beauty queen Ellen Sue Gotlander (Freddie Simpson), gentle left field/relief pitcher Betty "Spaghetti" Horn ([[Tracy Reiner]]), homely second baseman Marla Hooch ([[Megan Cavanagh]]), who was scouted by Ernie, Dottie and Kit in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]], first baseman Helen Haley ([[Anne Ramsay]]), and [[Saskatchewan]] native Alice "Skeeter" Gaspers ([[Renée Coleman]]). They and eight others are selected to form the [[Rockford Peaches]], while 48 others are split among the [[Racine Belles]], [[Kenosha Comets]], and [[South Bend Blue Sox]].  The Peaches are managed by Jimmy Dugan ([[Tom Hanks]]), a former marquee Cubs slugger who initially treats the whole thing as a joke. The league attracts little interest at first. With a [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine photographer in the stands, Lowenstein begs the players to do something spectacular. Dottie obliges when a ball is popped up behind home plate, catching it while doing a [[Split (gymnastics)|split]]. The resulting photograph makes the magazine cover. A publicity campaign draws more people to the ballgames, but the owners remain unconvinced. Due to Kit's and Dottie's sibling rivalry, Kit is traded to the Peaches' rival, the Racine Belles.  The Peaches end the season qualifying for the league's World Series. In the locker room, Jimmy gives Betty a telegram that informs her her husband was [[killed in action]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]]. The grief-stricken Betty leaves the team. Later that evening, Dottie receives a surprise when Bob, who was serving in Italy, shows up, having been discharged from the Army. The following morning, Jimmy discovers that Dottie is going home with Bob. Unable to persuade her to at least play in the World Series, he tells her she will regret her decision.  The Peaches and Belles meet in the World Series, which reaches a seventh and deciding game. Dottie, having reconsidered during the drive back to Oregon, is the catcher for the Peaches, while Kit is the starting pitcher for the Belles. With the Belles leading by a run in the top of the ninth, Dottie drives in the go-ahead run. Kit is the final batter. Under immense pressure, she gets a hit and, ignoring the third base coach's sign to stop, scores the winning run by knocking her sister over at the plate and dislodging the ball from Dottie's hand. The sellout crowd convinces Harvey to give Lowenstein the owners' support. After the game, the sisters reconcile before Dottie leaves with Bob.  Back in the present, Dottie is reunited with several other players, including Kit. The fates of several of the characters are revealed: Jimmy, Bob, and Evelyn have died, while Marla has been married to Nelson, a man she met in a bar, for over 40 years. The original Peaches sing a team song composed by Evelyn and pose for a group photo.  
The Lawnmower Man (film)
 Dr. Lawrence Angelo works for Virtual Space Industries, running experiments in increasing the intelligence of [[chimpanzee]]s using drugs and [[virtual reality]]. One of the chimps escapes using the warfare tactics for which he was being trained.  Dr. Angelo is generally a [[pacifism|pacifist]], who would rather explore the intelligence-enhancing potential of his research without applying it for military purposes. His wife Caroline is unhappy with the way he is ignoring her to focus on this project.  Jobe Smith, a local [[greenskeeper]] with an [[intellectual disability]], lives in the garden shed owned by the local priest, Father Francis McKeen. McKeen's brother, Terry, is a local landscape gardener and employs Jobe to help him with odd jobs. Father McKeen punishes the challenged Jobe with a belt and "Hail Marys" whenever he fails to complete his chores.  Dr. Angelo realizes he needs a human subject to work with, and he spots Jobe mowing his lawn.  Peter Parkette, Dr. Angelo's young  neighbor, is friends with Jobe. Dr. Angelo invites both of them over to play some virtual reality games. Learning more about Jobe, Angelo persuades him to participate in his experiments, letting him know it will make him smarter. Jobe agrees and begins the program. Dr. Angelo makes it a point to redesign all the intelligence-boosting treatments without the "aggression factors" used in the chimpanzee experiments.  Jobe soon becomes smarter, for example, learning [[Latin]] in only two hours. Meanwhile, Jobe also begins a sexual relationship with a young rich widow, Marnie. However, Jobe begins to display [[telepathic]] abilities and has [[hallucinatory|hallucinations]]. He continues training at the lab, until an accident makes Dr. Angelo shut the program down. The project director, Sebastian Timms, employed by a mysterious agency known as [[The Shop (Stephen King)|The Shop]], keeps tabs on the progress of the experiment, and discreetly swaps Dr. Angelo's new medications with the old Project 5 supply (reintroducing the "aggression factors" into the treatment).  Jobe develops [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] and [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] powers and takes Marnie to the lab to make love to her while in virtual reality. Something goes wrong in the simulation when Jobe's virtual avatar becomes violent, attacking her mind directly; Marnie is driven insane, laughing endlessly at nothing.  Jobe's powers continue to grow, but the treatments are also affecting his mental stability, and he decides to exact revenge on those who abused him when he was "dumb": Father McKeen is engulfed in flames, a bully named Jake is put into a [[catatonia|catatonic]] state by a mental "lawnmower man" continually mowing his brain, and a lawnmower invention of Jobe's runs down Harold, Peter's abusive father. Jobe uses his telepathic abilities to make the investigating police attribute it all to "bizarre accidents" in front of Dr. Angelo.  Jobe believes his final stage of [[evolution]] is to become "pure energy" in the VSI computer [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]], and from there reach into all the systems of the world. He promises his "birth" will be signaled by every telephone on the planet ringing simultaneously. The Shop sends a team to capture Jobe, but they are ineffective against his abilities and he scatters their molecules. Jobe uses the lab equipment to enter the mainframe computer, abandoning his body to become a completely virtual being, leaving his body behind like a [[husk]].  Dr. Angelo remotely infects the VSI computer, encrypting all of the links to the outside world, trapping Jobe in the mainframe. As Jobe searches for an unencrypted network connection, Dr. Angelo primes bombs to destroy the building. Feeling responsible for what has happened to Jobe, Angelo then joins him in virtual reality to try to reason with him. Jobe overpowers and [[crucifixion|crucifies]] him, then continues to search for a network connection. Peter runs into the building; Jobe still cares for him and allows Dr. Angelo to go free to rescue Peter. Jobe forces a computer-connected security door to open, allowing Peter and Dr. Angelo to escape. Jobe escapes through a [[backdoor (computing)|back door]] before the building is destroyed in multiple explosions.  Back at home with Peter, Dr. Angelo and Peter's mother Carla (who has become a romantic interest) are about to leave when their telephone rings, followed by the noise of a second, and then hundreds of telephones ring, all around the globe.  
The Legend of the Roller Blade Seven
 This film takes place in an apocalyptic land of the future known as ''The Wheelzone''.  In this place there are no cars and people travel on skates and skateboards.    The plot of this film traces the exploits of Hawk Goodman (played by Shaw), who is on a quest to rescue several young ladies from the grasp of the evil overlord Pharaoh (played by Smith).  Because this film was composed of footage taken from the other two features associated with this project, ''The Legend of the Roller Blade Seven'' follows a very similar storyline to ''The Roller Blade Seven'', with a few elements added from ''Return of the Roller Blade Seven''.  Most notably, a very extensive fight scene where a large number of combatants battle with [[samurai sword]]s and martial arts.  
Leap of Faith (film)
  Faith healer Jonas Nightengale ([[Steve Martin]]) makes a living traveling across America holding [[tent revival]] meetings and conducting purported "[[miracle]]s". He is helped by his friend and manager Jane Larson ([[Debra Winger]]), and an entourage of fellow [[confidence trick|con artists]].  One of their trucks breaks down in the fictional town of Rustwater, [[Kansas]]. Rustwater, with its 27 percent unemployment rate, is in desperate need of rain to save its crops. Learning they will be stuck in Rustwater for days waiting for replacement parts to come in for one of the many big trucks of their fleet, Jonas decides to hold revival meetings despite the town's small size in an effort to cut some of their losses while the truck is being repaired. Early on, Jonas meets Marva, a waitress in a local café. She rebuffs his persistent advances.  Local sheriff Will Braverman ([[Liam Neeson]]) is skeptical and tries to prevent his townspeople from being conned out of what little money they do have. First, he engages in some legal harassment, sending all of the city and county inspectors to examine his facilities. After seeing the excessive pageantry of the first show and the counting of money by the team on Jonas' tour bus, Braverman decides to investigate Jonas' past. He learns that Jonas, claiming to have been born in a humble log cabin in [[Appalachian Mountains|the Appalachians]], is in fact Jack Newton, a native of [[New York City]]. Between the age of 15 and 18 he lived a life of crime, including petty theft and drug possession. Braverman shares this information with the townspeople who have gathered for another tent revival. Jonas storms off the stage, soon returning to successfully spin Braverman's report, leaving the crowd more energized than ever, much to Braverman's exasperation.  Jonas also gives back the collections for the day, saying he could not take their money in good conscience knowing that they doubted him and that if his faith was strong God would send them a sign. He also has his crew secretly plant an additional $80 among the crowd, setting up the believers for a miracle the next day. The next morning, the huge crucifix forming the backdrop of the revival tent with [[Jesus|Jesus']] eyes normally closed is found to somehow have his eyes opened. A shocked Jonas, in front of all the townspeople and numerous television cameras from the region's [[network affiliate]]s, proclaims it a miracle which is amplified as townsfolk who had money planted on them reveal their unexplained fortunes.  Throughout all of this is a subplot involving Jane and Braverman, who find themselves falling for each other. She becomes enchanted by Braverman's simple farm life and his interest in butterflies. However, after Braverman's disclosure of Jonas' past Jane breaks off their budding relationship. They soon, however, meet again and Jane confesses to Braverman that she is tired of manipulating people. He makes it clear he would like a permanent relationship with her if she will stay.  Meanwhile, Jonas can't understand why Marva won't date him. Marva points to her brother Boyd who walks with [[crutch]]es following an auto accident in which also their parents died. Marva explains that doctors couldn't find anything physically wrong with him, so as a last resort she took him to a faith healer who subsequently blamed it on Boyd's supposed lack of faith. Marva now detests faith healers, having had one blame her brother for his own psychosomatic disability.  Boyd comes to believe that Jonas can make him walk again. He goes to the revival and implores Jonas to heal him. Jonas finishes the show while pretending not to notice the boy, but is compelled to return to the stage after the crowd begins to chant "one more."  Jonas spins the expected failure to heal Boyd by blaming Braverman, who is present, saying that if a failure occurs, it will be due to Braverman's skepticism. Boyd walks to the open-eyed crucifix and touches the feet of Jesus Christ. He drops his crutches and begins to walk unassisted. The awed crowd sweeps the stage. After the show, an enraged Jonas rails to Jane that he was conned and that Boyd upstaged him. Jane doesn't believe it was a con. The production crew are thrilled with all the money that came in as a result of Boyd being healed and want Boyd to join the show. A clearly annoyed Jonas reluctantly agrees and stalks off the bus. Jane follows him out and they argue.  After the revival, Jonas enters the empty, darkened tent and mocks the crucifix and Christianity. Boyd walks in while Jonas is talking. Boyd thanks Jonas for healing him, but Jonas insists angrily that he did nothing. Boyd says it doesn't matter, that the job still got done. Jonas accuses Boyd of being a better con artist than he himself. Boyd wants to join Jonas on the road, telling him a lot of ways he can help out exist and promising to earn his keep. Jonas agrees to meet Boyd the following morning, implying Boyd can come. Then Boyd's sister Marva arrives. She sends him out of the tent saying that people are looking for him. She thanks Jonas, who tells her that he will not be meeting her brother Boyd the next morning. He asks her to tell Boyd that "just because a person didn't show up doesn't mean that the person doesn't care about them." referencing a set up earlier in the movie where Jane defended Jonas by telling Braverman the story of a five-year-old Jonas waiting in vain for four days for his mother to return, for many years while living in an orphanage holding steadfast to the belief that one day she indeed would. (The line is also found in the 1999 film adaptation of [[Graham Greene]]'s [[The End of the Affair (1999 film)|The End of the Affair]].)  Jonas leaves the tent and sees the crowd that has gathered just outside it, many praying, some sleeping in groups, and others feeding the crowd that has gathered. He begins to understand that Boyd's miracle, and the faith that enabled it, are real after all. He packs a bag and departs alone under the cover of darkness, leaving behind his entire road show and most of all of the rest of everything that he owns - including his silver-sequined jacket and an envelope for Jane containing his ring that she had long coveted - and hitches a ride on the nearby Interstate from which they had come to Rustwater at the start of the story. Braverman and Jane drive to Jonas' motel room and find him gone.    Jonas hitches a ride with a truck driver bound for [[Pensacola, Florida]]. When asked by the driver if he is in some kind of trouble, Jonas replies "No sir, no sir. Probably for the first time in my life". As they continue to ride along, the drought, threatening the crop harvest that is the centerpiece of the town's economy, comes to a dramatic end in a miraculous downpour. Jonas laughs silently to himself as he realizes the truth, and the film ends as he rides off into the stormy evening, hanging out the truck window loudly thanking Jesus for the rain.

He eventually joins a police training college and gets posted as a Police Constable in an area where Don Dawood ([[Raghuvaran]]) rules over the area. Ramu wins over Don Dawood, encountering ordeals. He falls in love with Sangeetha (played by debutant Samyuktha).  
Lethal Weapon 3
 A week before his retirement, [[Los Angeles Police Department|L.A.P.D.]] Sergeant [[Roger Murtaugh]] (Glover) and his partner [[Martin Riggs]] (Gibson) are demoted to uniform duties after trying to defuse a bomb before the bomb squad arrived, causing the destruction of an otherwise empty office building. While on street patrol they witness the theft of an [[armored car (valuables)|armored car]], and help to thwart the crime. One of the two thieves gets away, but the other is taken into police custody. The suspect is found to be a known associate of Jack Travis (Wilson), a former LAPD lieutenant who is believed to be running an arms smuggling ring in Los Angeles. The department is further concerned that the thieves were using [[Armor-piercing shell|armor-piercing bullets]], informally referred to as "cop killers". Riggs and Murtaugh are re-promoted and assigned to work with Sergeant Lorna Cole (Russo) from internal affairs to track down Travis.  Travis is currently negotiating with mobster Tyrone (Millar) regarding his arms deal. The armored car thief that escaped is brought to Travis, who subsequently kills him in front of Tyrone for putting the police on his trail. Travis then uses his old (but still valid) police credentials to enter the interrogation room and kill the suspect in custody before he can be interviewed. Travis is unaware that closed-circuit cameras have been installed in the station, and Cole is able to affirm Travis' identity. While the three are reviewing the footage, their good friend Leo Getz (Pesci) - who has been helping Murtaugh sell his house - arrives and immediately recognizes Travis from several prior business deals and his love of ice hockey. Riggs and Murtaugh narrowly miss capturing Travis at a hockey match that afternoon, but Getz has provided them with information of a warehouse Travis owns, which they suspect is where he has stored his arms shipments.  Riggs and Murtaugh contact Cole for backup before they raid the warehouse. While they wait, they witness a drug deal which they step in to stop. A gun fight breaks out, and Murtaugh kills one of those involved who had fired back at them, while the rest escape. Murtaugh is shocked to find the dead man is Darryl, a close friend of his son Nick. With Murtaugh emotionally distraught, Riggs goes with Cole to the warehouse, where they successfully overpower Travis' guards and secure his next arms shipment delivery. That night, Riggs and Cole find they have feelings for each other and sleep together. Riggs later goes to Murtaugh, who is still overwhelmed with guilt, and helps to counsel him in time for Darryl's funeral. There, Darryl's father passionately insist that Murtaugh find the person responsible for giving Darryl the gun.  Cole finds that Darryl's gun, the armor-piercing bullets, and the arms they recovered were originally in police custody, meant to be destroyed, and were likely stolen by Travis; they assure that his credentials are completely revoked from the system. They further tie the guns to Tyrone and interrogate him. Tyrone quickly reveals what he knows of Travis' plans, including an auto garage where many of his henchmen work from. Riggs, Murtaugh, and Cole are able to take several of the men into custody there. Meanwhile, Travis finds he cannot use his credentials anymore, and has one of his men hack into the computer system to find another arms storage area. He then forces Captain Murphy (Kahan) under gunpoint to take him to this new facility so he can steal the guns using Murphy's credentials. Cole finds the evidence of hacking and Murphy's absence, and the three, along with a rookie cop who looks up to Riggs and Murtaugh, go to intercept Travis. They are able to rescue Murphy and stop Travis and his men before he can take the weapons, but the rookie is killed as they give chase, and Riggs and Murtaugh vow to stop Travis.  Getz provides information on a housing development under construction by a company owned by Travis. Getz tries to join them but they shoot his tires out to stop him from coming. Riggs and Murtaugh instead bring Cole along to infiltrate the site at night, and find themselves met by Travis and his men who have been waiting for them. A large-scale gunfight breaks out, in which Riggs sets the construction site on fire and most of Travis' men are killed. Cole appears to be shot by Travis and falls, inciting Riggs. When Travis uses a bulldozer to chase down Riggs, using its blade as a bullet shield, Murtaugh tosses Daryl's gun, now loaded with the armor-piercing bullets, to Riggs, who then shoots and kills Travis through the blade. Cole is found to be alive and safe, having worn two protective vests. Riggs admits his love for her as she is taken away in a chopper.  The next day, Murtaugh's family are celebrating his retirement, when Murtaugh reveals to Getz that he has decided to not sell the house and stay with the force, preserving his partnership with Riggs. As the film ends, Riggs announces to Murtaugh that he and Cole are in a relationship.  
Léolo
 In [[Mile End, Montreal]], Léo Lauzon is a young boy living in a tenement with his [[dysfunctional family]], serving as the [[unreliable narrator]]. He uses his active fantasy life and the book ''L'avalée des avalés'' by [[Québécois (word)|Québécois]] novelist [[Réjean Ducharme]] to escape the reality of his life. He feels his father is insane and denies being his son. After having a dream revealing his mother was impregnated after falling into a cart of tomatoes contaminated by an Italian man's semen, Léo identifies as Italian rather than [[French Canadian]] and adopts the name Léolo Lozone.  [[File:Parce que.jpg|200px|thumb|Léolo reads ''L'avalée des avalés'' by [[Réjean Ducharme]].]] Growing up in an apartment with a rat in the bathtub, a [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] and a family obsessed with regular bowel movements, Léolo continues to write. His writings are discovered by the Word Tamer, a reincarnation of [[Don Quixote]] who searches through trash for letters and photographs. Léolo observes a neighbouring young woman named Bianca and imagines her singing to him from a closet, emitting a white light. His grandfather, who Léolo believes attempted to murder him by holding him under a pool, helps her financially and extorts her for sexual favours, revealing her breasts and putting his feet in her mouth. Léolo begins to fantasize about Bianca sexually and discovers [[masturbation]]. Meanwhile, his brother Fernand, after being beaten by a bully and failed in a [[special education]] class, builds up impressive muscles. The Word Tamer, continuously monitoring Léolo's thoughts, reads of the boy's hopes for how Fernand's muscles will make them invincible. However, upon being confronted by the bully for a second time, Fernand is overwhelmed with fear and is beaten again while Léolo watches in shock.  Finally convinced his grandfather is responsible for all of the family's troubles, Léolo attempts to lower a noose and hang his grandfather while he is in the bath. His grandfather sees Léolo doing it and is choked, before finally being freed, with Léolo injured in the process. Léolo subsequently goes to the hospital, where he is told his actions could constitute [[attempted murder]], though he is not charged. Reacting with horror to the ways other boys are pursuing sex, he seeks out the services of a [[prostitution in Canada|prostitute]] named Regina. Upon later becoming ill, he ends up in the same institution where many other members of his family have been treated at.  
Light Sleeper
 John LeTour, a 40-year-old New Yorker, is one of two delivery men for Ann, who supplies an exclusive clientele in the banking and financing sector with drugs. While Ann contemplates switching to the cosmetics business, LeTour, who suffers from [[insomnia]], has lost his perspective in life.  One night LeTour meets his former girlfriend Marianne, with whom he once shared an intense but destructive relationship due to drug abuse. Although they stopped taking drugs, Marianne refuses his offer for a new start. After spending one night together, she tells him that this was her way of saying good-bye. Unbeknown to Marianne, her mother died at the hospital while she was with LeTour. The next time he meets Marianne, she attacks him, demanding that he get out of her life once and for all.  Meanwhile, the police start observing LeTour because one of his clients, Tis, is connected to the drug-induced death of a young woman. On his next delivery, LeTour witnesses a heavily drugged Marianne in Tis' apartment. Only minutes after his departure, she falls several stories to her death. LeTour gives the police a lead to Marianne's last whereabouts. At the wake, Marianne's sister Randi tells him not to feel guilty for what happened.  When Tis orders a new supply and insists that LeTour delivers it, he senses that Tis wants to dispose of him. Ann accompanies him, but Tis' guards force her to leave the room. In the subsequent shootout, LeTour kills Tis and both of his henchmen, but is left critically wounded. He lies down on the hotel bed, showing no anger or pain, only a profound weariness, as police sirens can be heard in the distance.  Ann visits LeTour in jail, where he expresses his hopes for a better future. The film hints at the possibility that Ann will wait for him.  
Life, and Nothing More...
 A film director and his son start a journey towards Koker, where approximately half of ''[[Where is the Friend's Home?]]'' took place. During the first half, they search for a highway to the village, as most of the roads have been damaged or blocked by [[1990 Manjil–Rudbar earthquake|a severe earthquake two years prior]]; meanwhile, the two cross paths with several locals (who were also witnesses of the earthquake) and often ask directions.  After changing his route several times, the two finally reach one of the villages in which the aforementioned movie was filmed. They visit one of those who acted, and accompany him for a little while. The director and his son visit the destroyed village and hear additional stories of those who survived, among them a young married couple that lost many relatives in the disaster but [[Persian marriage|decided to marry anyway (since the dead did not foresee their demise)]]. One scene featuring this couple is a focal point of the third film in Kiarostami's Koker trilogy, ''[[Through the Olive Trees]]''.  Later, the director and his son find another child who acted in the movie and take him to the tents, where most Koker inhabitants whose houses have been destroyed stay. The son of the director wants to watch the final match of the Football World Cup with the other kids, so his father leaves him there and comes back later to pick him up. He talks with other witnesses of the earthquake and admires the spirit they have had to move on with their lives.  The film's last shot is several minutes long; the director is struggling to reach the town in his car. He passes a man carrying a tank and drives up a hill until the engine begins overheating and he is unable to continue. The man with the tank helps him restart the engine. The director seemingly leaves as the man with the tank goes walking uphill.

Live Wire (film)
 When a Senator is killed in an explosion, the FBI investigates. The agent in charge is bomb expert Danny O'Neill ([[Pierce Brosnan]]), who is separated from his wife Terry ([[Lisa Eilbacher]]) (due to the accidental drowning of their only child in their pool) and behaving very erratically. Initially the investigation does not reveal the kind of explosive used or even what was used to detonate it. Eventually it is learned that terrorists led by Mikhael Rashid ([[Ben Cross]]) have developed an "invisible" liquid explosive which is activated within the human body (by stomach acid). It also does not help that they have to report to Senator Traveres ([[Ron Silver]]), the man whom Terry is having an affair with and whom Danny also assaulted.  Later, another senator is killed while riding in a limousine; the limo being driven by one of Rashid's henchmen. The henchman is subsequently struck by a moving car, taken into custody and brought into court, and since he is now considered a risk by Rashid, the judge in the case is slipped the liquid and she spontaneously explodes; the witness is subsequently killed, though O'Neill discovers the cause of the explosions - the chemically enhanced water in the judge's pitcher.   It becomes obvious that the next target is Senator Traveres, so O'Neill, concerned that Terry may become collateral damage, trails his every move. At a fundraiser, Traveres is targeted by Rashid's main henchman, Al-red ([[Tony Plana]]), disguised as a clown. O'Neill alerts the public to the bomb's presence, and in desperation, Al-red ingests some of the infected liquid. O'Neill subdues Al-red and gets him away from party in a wheelchair just before he explodes. In the aftermath, O'Neill and Terry finally reconcile.  Aware that Traveres is still not safe, O'Neill infiltrates the senator's heavily guarded mansion, at a very convenient time as it is being overrun by the terrorists. O'Neill concocts a cornucopia of home-made weapons, even building bombs using fertilizer found in the kitchen cabinet. All the terrorists are killed except for Rashid, who holds Terry hostage in front of him and Traveres.  Rashid swallows some of the liquid, sealing his fate but intending to bring them all down with him. O'Neill manages to free Terry and send her to safe ground. He and Traveres however are cornered and are thus subsequently forced to jump from the third floor due to Rashid's explosion. Traveres lands on a wrought-iron fence which impales and kills him, though O'Neill survives. A year later, he has a second child with Terry.

Lorenzo's Oil
   [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Lorenzo]] is a bright and vibrant young boy living in the [[Comoro Islands]], as his father [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Augusto]] works for the [[World Bank]] and is stationed there. However, when his parents relocate back to the United States, he begins to show signs of neurological problems (such as falling, loss of hearing, tantrums, etc.). The boy is diagnosed as having [[adrenoleukodystrophy]] (ALD), which is fatal within two years. Failing to find a doctor capable of treating their son's rare disease Augusto and his wife, [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Michaela]], set out on a mission to find a treatment to save their child. In their quest, the Odones clash with doctors, scientists, and support groups who are skeptical that anything could be done about ALD, much less by laypeople. But they persist, setting up camp in medical libraries, reviewing animal experiments, enlisting the aid of Professor Gus Nikolais, badgering researchers, questioning top doctors all over the world, and even organizing an international symposium about the disease.  Despite research dead-ends, the horror of watching their son's health decline, and being surrounded by skeptics (including the coordinators of the support group they attend), they persist until they finally hit upon a therapy involving adding a certain kind of [[Lorenzo's oil|oil]] (actually containing two specific [[long chain fatty acids]], isolated from  [[rapeseed oil]] and [[olive oil]]) to their son's diet. They contact over 100 firms around the world until they find an elderly British chemist, Don Suddaby, who is working for [[Croda International]] and is willing to take on the challenge of distilling the proper formula. The oil, [[erucic acid]], proves successful in normalizing the accumulation of the very long chain fatty acids in the brain that had been causing their son's steady decline, thereby halting the progression of the disease. There is still a great deal of neurological damage remaining which could not be reversed unless new treatments could be found to regenerate the [[myelin sheath]] (a [[lipid]] insulator) around the nerves. The father is seen taking on the new challenge of organizing [[The Myelin Project|biomedical efforts to heal myelin damage in patients]].  Finally, Lorenzo, at the age of 14, shows definite improvement (swallowing for himself and answering "yes" or "no" questions by blinking) but more medical research is still needed. Ultimately it is revealed that Lorenzo has also regained his sight and is learning to use a computer.

Greenway goes undercover, changing her appearance and passing herself off as a repressed schoolteacher. She eventually encounters Hanover, who seduces her, photographs her nude and causes Lt. Johnson to believe that Greenway might actually have fallen under his spell.

The Lost World (1992 film)
 Set in 1912, the film opens on Edward Malone, a junior reporter looking for an adventurous assignment. Malone is sent to interview [[Professor Challenger]], an explorer and researcher who believes he is on the trail of the "lost world," a mysterious place in Central Africa. Challenger has a picture of a cliff and a strange beast resembling a [[pterodactyl]] that is his only evidence of the place.  The British scientific community finds his claims laughable. After receiving funding from the family of Jenny Nielson, a wildlife photographer and the daughter of a rich American contributor to the sciences, the "scientific community" agrees to organise an exploratory expedition under the leadership of the antagonistic Professor Summerlee. Summerlee agrees to Malone and Nielson coming on the expedition, but refuses to allow Challenger to be part of the expedition. With obvious reluctance, Challenger gives Summerlee a "map" to be opened at a road-end village in Africa at a particular date and time. The expedition departs. A newsboy associate of Malone named Jim stows away on the trip.  The expedition arrives in Africa where they are joined by a female guide named Malu and a Portuguese called Gomez. Summerlee opens the map from Challenger, finding it blank, at which point Challenger appears from nowhere leaving Summerlee no option but to accept his guidance on the exhibition. Under Challenger's guidance they find the cliff in the picture and reach the top, but Gomez (who turns out to be the brother of a Portuguese who was killed on Challenger's first journey here) strands them with no way back down. Exploring the Lost World to find another way home, the team finds dinosaurs, from a pair of [[Anatosaurus]] to a pterodactyl rookery.  Jim, Malone, and Malu narrowly avoid being eaten by a dinosaur (presumably a Herrerasaurus), only to find that their camp was attacked and the rest of the team is gone. The three discover a gathering of native tribesmen (painted with symbolic skeletons) who regularly sacrifice humans off a cliff to the carnivorous dinosaurs. While the 'skeleton men' sacrifice a man to a ''Tyrannosaurus rex'', Malone distracts the tribe while the other explorers and captured natives escape, and they retreat to the safety of a second tribe nearby (who use clothes, not paint). During these events, Summerlee notes some oddities about the "ritual" vegetation necklaces that the sacrifices (themselves) were dressed in. The second tribe's members, through Malu's translation, tell the explorers about a time long ago when the shamans of their tribe convinced some to worship the carnivorous dinosaurs, splitting the tribe in two.  Summerlee deduces that the vegetation necklaces placed on the sacrifices provided some necessary nutrient or immunisation to the dinosaurs which had protected these dinosaurs from the extinction that the rest of the dinosaurs suffered globally (this being a theory Summerlee had espoused previously). The expedition team uses their modern knowledge and research to benefit the tribe with irrigation and horticultural benefits, to produce the antidote to a prehistoric plague. The skeleton tribe's leader is killed, and the two tribes reunite. The chief shows the team a hidden cave that will lead them back to their world, and has them promise that they will come back if they are ever needed.  Returning to the river, the team is ambushed by Gomez. Gomez is shot and wounded, but instead of killing him, Challenger leaves him behind, saying, "Let the jungle have him." Malu stays in Africa, and the others return home. The Royal Zoological Society in London rules that Challenger and Summerlee have insufficient evidence of their tale, until Jim reveals that he brought back a baby pterodactyl. The team is celebrated for their achievements, but when Malone, Jenny, and Jim discover the pterodactyl (named Percival), is unhappy being kept in a zoo, they release him, allowing him to fly back to the "lost world".  
Living in Bondage
 Andy ([[Kenneth Okonkwo]]) and Merit Okeke (Nnenna Nwabueze) are a young couple facing several obstacles - Andy's redundancy and  infidelity, the loss of their savings on a bogus investment, and Merit's indecent proposals from lecherous men including her boss Ichie Million (Francis Agu). Andy constantly compares his lack of fortune to the success of his peers, especially best friend Paul (Okechukwu Ogunjiofor). Despite Merit's support and patience, Andy is driven to near-desperation, determined to obtain wealth by any means possible, and the slick-talking Paul lets Andy in on his secret - a satanic cult where members swear their loyalty to [[Lucifer]] and kill their loved ones in ritualized sacrifices to gain the wealth they crave. After much hesitation, Andy eventually agrees to sacrifice the person he loves the most - Merit. He reluctantly brings her to the cult where she is offered to Lucifer, shortly dying in a hospital, but not before she curses her husband's betrayal.  Andy's sudden wealth raises suspicion from Merit's family who accuse him of murdering her which he denies. He also faces a new set of problems - the [[paparazzi]], his mistress Ego ([[Ngozi Nwosu]]) fleeing with his money after he collapses at their wedding, and notably Merit's ghost haunting and terrorizing him, leading to embarrassing situations which make him a laughing stock. Andy would later marry Chinyere (Jennifer Okere), another [[gold digging|gold-digger]] introduced by Merit's former friend Caro (Ngozi Nwaneto), but she meets her untimely death after Caro poisons Chinyere in an attempt to escape abroad alone with the cash Chinyere had stolen from her husband. Caro is also killed by a hit-and-run driver on her way to the [[airport]], and Paul is murdered by [[hitman|hitmen]] hired by Andy after they both fall out.  A now frustrated Andy asks the satanic cult for help - but when the Chief Priest (Daniel Oluigbo) insists he can only pacify his late wife's spirit by blinding and castrating himself, he refuses and becomes mentally deranged, living as a vagrant under a [[Lagos]] [[overpass|flyover]] until Tina (Rita Nzelu) - a former [[prostitute]] he had earlier offered to the cult as a [[decoy]] before his deceit was exposed - takes him to her church where he finally confesses to Merit’s murder. In the film’s final scene, he praises [[God]] with the Evangelical Christians who assure Andy God will forgive him.<ref name="theage"></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>

His friends take him to a gypsy on 34th and Vine named Madame Ruth ([[Anne Bancroft]]). After reading his palm and seeing absolutely no romance in his life, Ruth gives him a small amount of Love Potion No. 8 on a piece of paper. As a scientist, Paul has doubts and ends up throwing it in the trash when he gets home. Around this time, Paul's friends buy him the services of Marisa, but all they do is talk.  His cat gets into the trash and eats some of the potion, then meows and attracts all the other cats in the neighborhood. When Paul sees the results, he takes it to Diane, and they find out the "scientific" properties of it. After analyzing it, they decide to use themselves as human test subjects. Diane ends up attracting an Italian car mogul and the prince of England, ending up getting a makeover in the process, while Paul has a string of hookups with women in bars, supermarkets, cars, sorority houses (notably [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alpha_Tau_Omega,_Georgia_Tech_fraternity,_Atlanta,_USA.jpg Alpha Tau Omega] at [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]), and female dormitories (notably [[Balch Hall]] at [[Cornell University]]).  Paul and Diane realize their romantic attraction to each other and become involved. Eventually, Paul plans a proposal to Diane; however, when he comes by her house to do so, she's not there. Later, she tells him she has fallen for Gary. (We have seen Gary before, taking advantage of her loneliness to have sex with her.) Paul is devastated and decides he really wants to get her back. Marisa comes to his house to steal his stereo, and after trying the potion in his bathroom, she makes Paul gladly give her all his valuables, including the potion.  After "waking up" from his infatuation, Paul gets an idea, and Madame Ruth confirms that somebody looking like Gary has bought all the potion No. 8. He phones Diane to tell her Gary is using the potion on her, but Gary forbids her to talk to him. After weeks of unsuccessful attempts, Paul goes back to Madame Ruth, who gives him Love Potion No. 9, which will not create love, but remove things obscuring it (such as potion No. 8). But if Diane was never really in love with him, Paul will love her for his entire life and she will eternally hate him.  Paul asks three friends to help him force Diane to take No. 9, but they can't believe him. Marisa arrives at the house and uses No. 8 to rob all of them, proving the power of the potion. When they arrive at the house, Diane's friend and matron of honor tells them Diane and Gary are marrying in an hour, but that she suspects something is wrong with Diane. Paul explains, she agrees to give Diane the potion, and things go terribly wrong, but Marisa, having tricked Gary's potion bottle from him, causes havoc and effectively ends the wedding, which gives Paul the chance to drink Potion No. 9, kiss Diane and wait five minutes as per the instructions. The effect kicks in too late but in the end, Diane runs away from Gary into Paul's arms.  
The Lover (film)
 The primary characters are known only as the Young Girl and the Chinese Man. The daughter of bitter, fearful, poverty-stricken colonials, the girl is a pretty waif who wears an old linen dress and a [[fedora]], and paints her lips bright red when out of her mother's sight. She and her family are French, but live in Vietnam where her mother is a schoolteacher to local children. Her weak-willed mother, violent older brother, and timid younger brother live in a rural section across the river. The girl is a loner but an excellent student, who dreams of being a writer.  The girl meets the Chinese man when crossing the river on the ferry to return to the city after a school holiday. He is the son of a businessman whose fortune was made in real estate, and has recently returned from Paris after finishing his Business studies. He has the look but lacks the self-assurance of the playboy he fancies himself to be, and he is mesmerized the first time he sees her standing by the rail on a crowded ferry crossing the [[Mekong River]]. After some awkward conversation, he offers her a ride to [[Saigon]] in his chauffeur-driven limousine and she accepts, although the two barely speak during the drive. In voice-over at the beginning of the film she originally gives her age as 15, but tells the man she is 17. He, as well, appears to exaggerate when he states he is 32, considering the usual age of the recent graduate at the time. The following day, he waits for her outside her boarding school, and the two go to the room he rents for entertaining mistresses in the seedy Chinese quarter, where they have sex.   They realize that "a future together is unthinkable" because she is scheduled to return to Paris soon, and he is arranged to marry a Chinese heiress. Aware of the limited time they have together, they fall into a relationship in which they shed all responsibilities that come with commitment. Every day after school, the girl goes to the rented room somewhat ambiguously acting out her pretend fantasy of the life of a fashionable courtesan.  The girl's family discovers the affair, and though at first angry, they encourage her to continue because the man is wealthy and able to pay off some of their debts. Despite this added tension, the affair continues passionately. The man even goes so far as to beg his father for his allowance to be with her instead of entering into his arranged marriage, but his father would rather see him dead than with a white girl. Though both devastated, the man marries his arranged bride, and the girl boards a ship days later to return to France.  Decades later, the girl has become a successful writer. In the final scene, the Chinese Man telephones her as he is visiting France with his wife. After some introductory reminiscence, he then comes to assure her that he never stopped loving her, and that he will not stop for the rest of his life.

Luna Park (1992 film)
  Set in a post-[[perestroika]], post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Moscow]], ''Luna Park'' follows the main character Andrei Leonov (Andrei Gutin) in his struggles to figure out who he is. At the beginning of the film, we see him as a young [[white power skinhead|antisemitic skinhead]]  [[bodybuilding]] leader of a group called "The Cleaners" who are set on purging [[Russia]] of anyone they deem unsuitable to the [[Russians|Russian]] bloodline, including, [[Jews]], [[homosexuals]], [[Alien (law)|foreigners]] and [[mentally challenged]] individuals.  The opening scene depicts a crowd of skinheads waving Russian flags and fighting a gang of bikers who they believed have succumbed to western influence and ideology. "The Cleaners" live in Luna Park, an amusement park, with wild roller coasters, and distorting mirrors and regularly head out into Moscow to cause chaos and destruction.  Having originally believed that his father was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] war hero who died in a military plane crash in [[Afghanistan]], he worships his father as the ideal Russian and strives to emulate him. When during a drunken night of confessions, he discovers that his father is actually a Jewish musician and still alive in Moscow, Andrei's life is turned upside-down, partly out of revulsion from whom he is descended, and partly because he wants to know (and be) with his father, and he must someway reconcile himself with this with discovery.  Andrei's initial reaction of shock is furthered by his mother Aliona ([[Natalya Yegorova]]), who demands he kill his father for the pain that he caused her, when at a young age, his father seduced her (making her pregnant) and then did not cast her as a singer for an important role, which blighted her career after that.  As the movie progresses, Andrei's quest for his father is successful, and we are introduced to Naoum Kheifitz ([[Oleg Borisov]]), a once-influential [[Jewish]] composer and conductor who is now forced to make a living as an entertainer at private parties. Having spent time with his father, and seeing him as a charming, personable, yet impoverished gentle man, Andrei begins to overcome his hatred for [[Jewish]] culture.   His father accepts Andrei and dismisses his [[anti-Semitism]], and proudly shows him off to his eccentric friends. This leads to a gradual change of Andrei's perspective, and he attempts to explain the situation to the members of his gang. They are not as accepting of his father, or of Andrei's [[Jewish]] roots, and they ransack Naoum's apartment, hang a young woman they find there, and abduct Naoum, taking him back to Luna Park. Andrei returns to the apartment and is horrified at the sight. He rushes to the park and saves his father, meanwhile the park catches fire, and Aliona chooses to perish with the park then face the reality of Andrei's choice.  The movie concludes with a scene of Andrei and Naoum getting on a train that's traveling to [[Siberia]], under the assumption that they will start a new life together, free from the influence of the gang or the city.

The Magic Voyage
 The year is 1492. Many people believed that the world was flat, and that ships would fall off the edge of the earth and float off into space. However, an Italian [[navigator]] named [[Christopher Columbus]] had a revolutionary idea — he thought that the world was square. That is, until a small [[woodworm]] named Pico overhears him and convinces Columbus that the world is really round by eating up the edges of his square globe, making it look round. Finally realizing that the world is round, Columbus decides to take his discovery to [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] and his wife [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]]. Pico joins him, and the duo instantly become friends.  As Columbus shows the King that the world is round and not flat, the King is outraged by this theory and has his guards throw Columbus out. But before they even get his hands on him, Isabella barges in and is instantly love-struck by Columbus. Columbus explains his voyage that will prove his newly discovered theory to Isabella, and she decides to finance Columbus' voyage to prove that the world is round. The King agrees to do this as well, but he tells Columbus that if he does not return with gold, he will be executed. As the three have a feast that night, Pico decides to leave them and snoop around the castle. He climbs a large tower and hops across from the window onto a [[chandelier]], where he meets Marilyn, the fairy princess of a faraway land. All was well with her land until the evil Swarm Lord took her away and keeps her prisoner inside the chandelier until she tells him the secret of her powers, which do not work on the forces of evil. Pico and Marilyn try to escape, but the Swarm Lord returns and takes Marilyn away to his lair in the still-undiscovered new world of [[United States|America]]. As the Swarm Lord flies away, Pico determines to get Marilyn back.  The next day, Columbus is about to set sail on the [[Santa María (ship)|Santa Maria]] to discover the new world. Pico rushes to the ship, but is stopped by a trio of rats, who plan to eat him. Pico manages to escape, but the rats follow him, hopefully to get a free ride to the new world. Pico gets on board Columbus's ship. The two friends reunite, and Pico explains that he needs to save Marilyn. Columbus's shipmates overhear their captain talking to Pico, and come to the conclusion that Columbus is crazy. As the ships continue on their voyage, Pico bumps into the rats again. They want to leave the ship on one of the lifeboats, because they overheard that the ship is heading to the supposed "edge of the earth". Pico needs them to stay, in case if the shipmates want to plan a mutiny on Columbus, and the lifeboat is his only chance. Pico convinces the rats to stay with his lie that there's giant amounts of cheese at the new world.  As day fades into night, Pico overhears that the shipmates really plan to kill Columbus and turn back in order to stay away from the edge of the earth. Pico tells this to Columbus, and Columbus is worried. However, he distracts his crew by singing a song to them about life on the sea and other leaders from other time periods, including [[Odysseus|Ulysses]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and the [[Vikings]]. Though he gets carried away with the final lyrics to the song that insults the crew (''I heard a tale of travelers who feared they would reach the edge / But long before, a serpent came and ate them up instead''), they let Columbus live. The next day, Columbus and the crew think they see land, but it is actually a deserted Viking ship. The crew is angry at Columbus once more and try to hang him. As he hangs, Columbus sees the new world. Just then, the Swarm Lord flies over the ship and tries to kill everyone on the ship. The ship manages to get away, and lands on The New World by crashing into a dam made by a beaver named Bob. While the crew stays behind, Pico, Columbus, Bob, and two of the rats (one of them did not survive the Swarm Lord's wrath) go through the jungles of the island to the Swarm Lord's [[Aztec]] temple.  Meanwhile, the Swarm Lord still wants Marilyn's powers, but Pico and his friends come in and save the day. Columbus climbs up to the top of the Swarm's giant [[honeycomb]] and takes a golden [[Cult image|idol]] while Pico saves Marilyn. Columbus uses the idol to squash the Swarm Lord, and Bob has finished chewing through the honeycomb, which causes it crumble. The temple starts to crumble as well. The team escapes, but Marilyn drowns in a waterfall and is found lifeless on a floating flower. Once the sun rises, she comes back to life and Pico and Marilyn kiss. Afterward, they encounter the island's natives, who thank Columbus for destroying the Swarm Lord. The group sail off back to [[Spain]], and Columbus is happy knowing that he discovered the new world and proved that the world is round.  The film ends with Columbus imaging what America will be like many years later, showing [[New York City|the city of Manhattan]]. The Hemdale English dub's end credits play the song "Heaven Is" by [[Al Jarreau]].

Man Bites Dog (film)
 Ben ([[Benoît Poelvoorde]]) is a witty, charismatic [[serial killer]] who holds forth at length about whatever comes to mind, be it the "craft" of murder, the failings of architecture, his own poetry, or classical music, which he plays with his girlfriend Valerie (Valérie Parent). A film crew joins him on his [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] adventures, recording them for a [[fly on the wall]] documentary. Ben takes them to meet his family and friends while boasting of murdering many people at random and dumping their bodies in canals and quarries. The viewer witnesses these grisly killings in graphic detail.  Ben ventures into apartment buildings, explaining how it is more cost-effective to attack old people than young couples because the former have more cash at home and are easier to kill. In a following scene, he screams wildly at an elderly lady, causing her to have a heart attack. As she lies dying, he casually remarks that this method saved him a bullet. Ben continues his candid explanations and appalling rampage, shooting, strangling, and beating to death anyone who comes his way: women (he is [[Misogyny|misogynistic]]), immigrants (he is a [[Racism|racist]] [[Xenophobia|xenophobe]]), and postmen (his favorite targets).  The camera crew becomes more and more involved in the murders, first as accomplices but eventually taking an active part in them. When Ben invades a home and kills an entire family, they help him hold down a young boy and smother him. They meet a competing camera crew and take turns shooting the three men. During filming, two of Ben's crew are killed; their deaths are later called "occupational hazards" by a crew member.  When Ben takes a couple hostage in their own home, he holds the man at gunpoint while he and the crew gang-rape the woman. The following morning, the camera dispassionately records the aftermath: the woman has been butchered with a knife, her entrails spilling out, and the man has been shot to death. Ben's violence becomes more and more random until he kills an acquaintance in front of his girlfriend and friends during a birthday dinner. Spattered with blood, they act as though nothing horrible has happened, continuing to offer Ben presents. The film crew disposes of the body for Ben.  After a victim flees before he can be killed, Ben is arrested, but he escapes. At this point someone starts taking revenge on him and his family. Ben discovers that his parents have been killed, along with his girlfriend Valerie: a flautist, she has been murdered in a particularly humiliating manner, with her flute inserted into her anus. This prompts Ben to decide that he must leave. He meets the camera crew to say farewell, but in the middle of reciting a poem he is abruptly shot dead by an off-camera gunman. The camera crew is then picked off one by one. After the camera falls, it keeps running, and the film ends with the death of the fleeing sound recordist.

But when the boy's condition worsens, she gives in and the boy is inoculated.  The next morning, the boy is better but the village is in tumult. The logging road is nearly finished. Campbell appeals to the company's workers to halt construction until he can conclude his research, but it refuses. In desperation and after new samples fail to contain the missing compound, Crane runs the chromatograph one more time and accidentally discovers that the source of the cure is not the flower but a species of rare ant [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] to the rainforest. Campbell demands the construction stop. A fight results and a bulldozer catches fire, destroying the village and the research station along with many acres of rainforest.  The next day, Crane promises to send Campbell new equipment and the research assistant he'd originally requested. She is about to return home when she meets the medicine man. He symbolically passes on his mantle to Campbell, and Crane accepts an invitation to continue working with him in exchange for recognition for co-discovering the source of the compound.

In a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]], it is revealed that Caine’s father was a drug dealer who was killed when Caine was 10, and that his mother was a [[heroin]] addict who died of a drug overdose, which led to Caine being raised by his grandparents.   O-Dog proudly shows off the surveillance tape to his admiring friends. Caine, disgusted at O-Dog's carelessness, tells him to stop showing off the incriminating tape, fearing they will get caught. Later, while Caine and his cousin Harold have left a party to go to a fast food restaurant, Harold is killed, Caine gets wounded, and their car is stolen in a [[carjacking]].

Memoirs of an Invisible Man (film)
 Nick Halloway ([[Chevy Chase]]) is a [[stock analyst]] who spends most of his life avoiding responsibility and connections with other people. At his favorite bar, the Academy Club, his friend George Talbot ([[Michael McKean]]) introduces him to Alice Monroe ([[Daryl Hannah]]), a TV documentary producer. Sharing an instant attraction, Nick and Alice make out in the ladies' room and set a lunch date for Friday.  The following morning, a hungover Nick attends a shareholders' meeting at Magnascopic Laboratories. Unable to endure the droning presentation by Dr. Bernard Wachs ([[Jim Norton (Irish actor)|Jim Norton]]), Nick leaves the room for a nap. A lab technician ([[Aaron Lustig]]) accidentally spills his mug of coffee onto a computer console, causing a meltdown, and the entire building is evacuated. The building seems to explode, but there is no debris. Instead, much of the building is rendered invisible, including Nick.  Shady CIA operative David Jenkins ([[Sam Neill]]) arrives on the scene, and discovers Nick's condition. While they are transferring him to an ambulance, the agents joke about how Nick will spend the rest of his life being studied by scientists. In a panic, Nick flees. Jenkins convinces his supervisor Warren Singleton ([[Stephen Tobolowsky]]) not to notify CIA headquarters so that they can capture and take credit for Nick, who could become the perfect secret agent.  Nick hides at the Academy Club. He locates Dr. Wachs and asks for his help to reverse his condition. Wachs agrees to help, but Jenkins kills him to keep Nick's invisibility a secret. Jenkins' team gets a hold of Nick's background information but it doesn't prove very useful in finding him. It says that Nick has never been married, his parents are both dead, he has no relatives, a few friends but none that he's real close to and he's not really dedicated to his job as he does it fast and loose. After reviewing Nick's profile, Jenkins says that Nick was an invisible man even before the accident. Nick infiltrates the CIA headquarters to find any information that can be used against them. Jenkins discovers Nick and tries to recruit him, but Nick is disgusted by the idea of him killing people. They have a confrontation, but Nick gets away.  Nick goes to San Francisco and stays in George's remote beach house. George arrives with his wife Ellen ([[Patricia Heaton]]), Alice, and another friend, to spend the weekend. Nick phones Alice and tells her to meet him nearby. He reveals his condition to Alice, and she promptly faints. When she revives, Alice decides to stay with Nick and help him. They travel to Mexico, where Nick can start a new life. To make money, he trades stocks using Alice as a proxy. Jenkins tracks them down, and shoots Nick with a [[tranquillizer gun]]. Nick falls into a river, revives and escapes. He makes his way to a video store, where he records his memoirs on video tape, including an ultimatum for Jenkins: exchange Alice for the tape, or Nick will give it to the CIA and the press. Jenkins agrees to the exchange.  At the arranged time for the exchange, Jenkins puts Alice into a cab and orders his men to surround the phone booth where he thinks Nick is. The man in the phone booth turns out to be George, who is dressed in Nick's concealing clothing. Nick is disguised as the cab driver; he takes Alice away, pursued by Jenkins. They continue the chase on foot into a building still under construction, in the course of which Nick gets covered with concrete dust, outlining his silhouette. At the top, by taking off his jacket (which has the largest amount of dust on it), Nick tricks Jenkins into thinking that he has become desperate enough to commit suicide.  Nick holds the jacket out to his side and pretends to begin to fall. Jenkins lunges at the jacket to try to save him, but ends up plunging off the building to his death.  Believing Nick to be dead, Singleton releases Alice. Nick reunites with Alice and they leave for Switzerland. The film ends with shots of Nick's apparently empty clothing skiing down a mountainside towards their chalet, where a pregnant Alice greets him with a hot drink and a kiss.

Meet the Parents (1992 film)
 A man (John Dacosse), on his way to meet his fiancée's parents, stops to get gas at a gas station. He mentions his plans to the attendant (Jim Vincent), who advises him against it. He tells the tale of Greg ([[Greg Glienna]]) and Pam (Jacqueline Cahill), who were a couple in a similar situation...with a disastrous outcome.  Greg sets off a number of incidents that bring shame and disappointment upon his character, leaving Pam's parents (Dick Galloway & Carol Whelan) with an unadmirable and undesirable son-in-law. After breaking the prized Victrola, ruining the roast, renting the only [[Andy Griffith]] slasher/porno movie in existence, clogging the toilet, stabbing the mother's eye with a fishing pole, being framed for marijuana possession, wrecking the car, drowning the dog, losing a fight with an ex-boyfriend (Harry Hickstein), and knocking over an urn, Greg has no reputation left to lose. Throughout the visit, Pam's sister Fay, an aspiring singer who can't hold a note, keeps insisting Greg hear her audition, since she mistakenly thinks he has ties with [[Ed McMahon]] from [[Star Search]]. Greg plans to flee the house with Pam to prevent any more damage, but Fay isn't letting him leave without hearing her sing. Greg's car has conveniently broken down, leaving him no choice but to hear Fay sing.   Once the tortuous ballad entitled "When Philip's There" has ended, Greg is asked to give suggestions. Fearing to start a fuss, he refuses to speak his mind; but Fay's not letting him leave without giving input either. Greg gives slight criticism, leaving her fuming mad. At this point, Pam and her parents have had enough with Greg and force him to leave the house. Greg, surrendered (or perhaps unchained), approaches the front door. Meanwhile, Pam's scream coming from her sister's room upstairs startles the parents. Fay has hanged herself, with a sign reading (in smeared lipstick) "Greg killed me" around her neck. The father grabs his gun and rushes down the stairs to the foyer. We cut back to the gas station where the attendant reveals what happens in the end. The customer seems very uneasy about meeting his fiancée's parents now, but once that customer leaves - in walks another one. The next customer (Marc Vann) is on his way to the circus - and the attendant advises him against it, beginning a whole new story.

The Mighty Ducks
 Gordon Bombay ([[Emilio Estevez]]) is a successful [[Minneapolis]] defense attorney who never loses a case but whose courtroom antics have earned him no respect among his peers. After successfully defending a client resulting in his 30th win, Bombay is called into his boss's office to be congratulated but also chastised for embarrassing the judge. He responds by going out drinking and is subsequently arrested for drunken driving. Bombay is sentenced to community service by coaching the local "District 5" [[Minor ice hockey|Pee-Wee hockey]] team. Bombay has an unpleasant history with the sport; in 1973, Bombay was the star player on the Hawks, but, struggling to cope with the loss of his father, he missed a penalty shot during the championship game, disappointing his hyper-competitive coach, Jack Reilly ([[Lane Smith]]). The Hawks would go on to lose in overtime.  When Bombay meets the team, he realizes that the children have no practice facility, equipment, or ability. The team's first game with Bombay at the helm is against the Hawks. Reilly is still the head coach and remains bitter about Gordon's miss years earlier. District 5 is routed as Reilly demands the Hawks run up the score; after the game, Bombay berates the team for not listening to him, and the players challenge his authority. For the next match, Bombay tries to teach his team how to dive and draw penalties, but this angers the team further. Meanwhile, Bombay discovers his old mentor and family friend Hans ([[Joss Ackland]]), who owns a nearby sporting goods store, was in attendance. While visiting him, Bombay recalls that he quit playing hockey after losing his father four months before the championship game, and due to Reilly blaming Gordon for the loss. Hans encourages him to rekindle his childhood passion.  Bombay approaches his boss, the firm's co-founder Gerald Ducksworth ([[Josef Sommer]]) to sponsor the team. The result is a complete makeover for the team - both in look, as they can now buy professional equipment, and in skill, as Bombay has more time to teach the kid's hockey fundamentals. Currently playing as the Ducks (named for Ducksworth). They fight to a tie in the next game. The Ducks recruit three new players: [[Figure skating]] siblings Tommy ([[Danny Tamberelli]]) and Tammy Duncan (Jane Plank) and slap shot specialist and [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]] Fulton Reed ([[Elden Henson]]). The potential of Ducks player Charlie Conway ([[Joshua Jackson]]) catches Bombay's eye; he takes him under his wing and teaches him some of the hockey tactics he used when he played with the Hawks.  Bombay learns that, due to redistricting, the star player for the Hawks, Adam Banks ([[Vincent Larusso]]), should be playing for the Ducks. He then threatens Reilly into transferring Banks to the Ducks. After hearing an out-of-context quote about them, the Ducks players lose faith in Bombay and revert to their old habits.  Ducksworth makes a deal with Reilly about the Hawks keeping Banks; however, Bombay refuses it, since it would be against [[Sportsmanship|fair play]], which Ducksworth berated him about when he started his community service. Left with either the choice of letting his team down or get fired from his job, Bombay takes the latter.  Bombay manages to win back the trust of his players after they win a crucial match, and Banks, who decided he'd rather play for the Ducks than not play hockey at all, proves to be an asset, and the Ducks reach the championship against the Hawks. Despite the Hawks' massive attacks taking Banks out of the game, the Ducks manage to tie the game late, and Charlie is tripped by a Hawks player as time expires. In precisely the same situation Bombay faced at the beginning of the film, Charlie prepares for a penalty shot to win the championship. In stark contrast to Reilly - who told Bombay that if he missed, he was letting everyone down - Bombay tells Charlie that he will believe in him no matter what happens. Inspired, Charlie jukes out the goalie with a "triple-deke" (taught to him by Bombay) to defeat the Hawks for the state championship.  The Ducks and family race out onto the ice in jubilation, where Bombay thanks Hans for his belief in him and Hans tells Bombay he is proud of him. Later, Bombay boards a bus headed to a minor-league tryout, secured for him by the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Basil McRae]] of the [[Minnesota North Stars]] (now the [[Dallas Stars]]). Although he seems daunted at the prospect of going up against younger players, he receives the same words of encouragement and advice from the Ducks Bombay had given them, promising he will return next season to defend their title.

With Inoue's direction, the hotel staff comes together to face down the yakuza ruffians, who are portrayed as craven, outwardly-threatening-but-inwardly-weak, fools.  
A Midnight Clear
 In the early phase of the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December 1944, a small [[US Army]] intelligence and reconnaissance squad (selected for their high IQs), are sent to occupy a deserted [[chateau]] near the German lines to gather information on the enemy’s movements. Losses from an earlier patrol has reduced the squad to just six men: Sgt. Knott, Miller, Avakian, Shutzer, Wilkins, and Mundy. On their way to the chateau, they discover the frozen corpses of a German and an American in a standing embrace, seemingly arranged by the Germans as a grim joke.  Settling into their temporary home, they soon discover they are not alone. A group of German soldiers has occupied a position nearby. While out on patrol, Knott, Mundy, and Shutzer see a trio of German soldiers aiming their weapons at them, but the enemy then vanish without shooting. The Germans, clearly more skilled and experienced than the young GIs, soon leave calling cards, start a snowball fight one evening and offer a Christmas truce. At first, the Americans think the Germans are taunting them but it eventually becomes clear that the enemy want to parley. Shutzer speaks enough German to communicate with the enemy who turn out to be a small group of youngsters still in their teens, commanded by an aging NCO. Having survived the Russian front, the Germans say they wish to surrender. But they ask that the Americans pretend that they were captured in combat so as to protect their families back home from possible retribution for their desertion. The Americans agree, but keep the plan from Wilkins, who has been mentally unstable since learning of the death of his child back home.  The two groups meet and proceed to fire their weapons into the air as planned. However Wilkins hears the shooting and thinks the engagement is real. Arriving at the scene, Wilkins opens fire at the Germans whereupon the latter, thinking they have been tricked, immediately shoot back. The situation immediately goes out of control and Knott's squad are forced to kill all of the enemy soldiers but not before Mundy is fatally hit and Shutzer is also badly wounded. Mundy’s final words are to beg the others not to tell Wilkins that the skirmish was intended to be fake. The squad’s superior officer arrives, reprimanding them for their conduct, before taking Shutzer back for treatment (they later receive word that he died in hospital). Left alone again, the four remaining soldiers quietly reflect as they try and celebrate Christmas, cleaning Mundy’s body in a bathtub. Shortly afterwards, the squad is forced to flee as the Germans attack the area in strength. Carrying Mundy’s corpse, they disguise themselves as medics and escape back to American lines. There Knott is informed that Wilkins has been recommended for the [[Bronze Star]] and transferred to the motor pool, while the rest of the squad will be sent into the front line to fight as regular infantry.  
Mindwarp (film)
 The story takes place in the year 2037, after the loss of the [[ozone layer]] has left most of the planet a desolate wasteland scattered with highly radioactive "Death Zones", except for several areas that still flourish.  Much of the human population has been reduced to Crawlers, mutated cannibalistic underground dwellers who have lost their intelligence and speak only in grunts and mine garbage dumps. Outworlders are un-mutated humans who live in the Death Zones. A few humans are Dreamers, who live in Inworld, a sealed [[biosphere]] maintained by the central Infinisynth  computer. They spend all their time plugged in via implants in their necks, living through [[virtual reality]] fantasies.  The heroine, Judy, a dreamer, lives with her mother. She has gradually become less satisfied with the life they have. After an unsuccessful attempt to talk directly to her mother, Judy manages to penetrate her virtual reality to wake herself up. Judy interrupts the dream, but she causes her mother to die in the real world.  For interfering with dreams of other users, Judy is exiled from Inworld by the mysterious System Operator who controls Infinisynth. She is saved from the Crawlers by Stover, an Outworlder who believes he is the last "normal" human being still living on the surface, protecting himself from the deadly [[ultraviolet]] rays, radioactivity, caustic ground water, and Crawlers, while subsisting on a diet of small animals. The two are captured by the Crawlers, however, and brought to their underground village, where Stover is set to work mining the garbage dump. Judy is saved by the Crawlers' leader, the masked Seer (who is intelligent and can speak), from being butchered. The Seer's consort, Cornelia, also an Outworlder, is jealous of the Seer's intentions towards Judy. Her attempt to infect Judy with a mutant leech-like parasite fails, however, and the Seer has Cornelia's slave/foster daughter Claude crushed by an elaborate meat grinder constructed from salvaged parts. It is a quasi-religious ritual attended by the Crawler population, who all drink Claude's blood. The Seer reveals himself to be an Inworlder.  In the meantime, Stover uses a food processor blade he finds in the dump to escape and free Judy, only to be recaptured. He is thrown into a half-submerged cage where he is attacked by many of the mutant leeches. The Seer, meanwhile, reveals to Judy he is her father, rationalizing his actions by claiming he did what was necessary to survive. He wants Judy to follow in his footsteps. Initially, she is ambivalent, but becomes fully resistant when he reveals the second part of his plan: the two of them will breed a race of healthy children to continue leading the Crawlers. She escapes and liberates Stover, scraping off the parasites with a sharp blade. The two are captured yet again, and the Seer convenes another ceremony to put them into the grinder. Judy overcomes him and feeds her father into the machine, causing the Crawlers to proclaim her as the new Seer. By that time, Stover, who seems to go insane from the leech infection, tries to convince her to stay and accept the leadership as well.  Judy escapes to the surface with Stover chasing after her. When they stop and talk, Stover (infected by the leeches) suddenly vomits leech larvae onto her. Then she wakes up back in Inworld and realizes it was all an Infinisynth simulation. She is then confronted by her father, who is in actuality the Infinisynth System Operator and wants to hand the position down to her. Judy wakes up again back in her old room, living with her mother. The ending leaves the question whether the handing of the System Operator position over to her actually happened or was only a simulation created by her subconscious mind.  
Mikey (film)
  Mikey, a young boy, is setting newspapers on fire in his basement. He blames his younger sister, Beth, when his foster mother, Grace, reprimands him for it. Grace slaps him, and he later yells at Beth, asking her why she didn't defend him. He ends up throwing her doll into the pool. When Beth reaches to get it, Mikey jumps up and down on the diving board, causing her to fall into the pool and drown.  He goes upstairs to the bathroom, where he overhears Grace taking a bath and telling a friend on the phone that adopting Mikey might have been a mistake. The phone dies, and Grace notices Mikey standing in front of the tub. Startled, she chides him for not knocking before he came in. He accuses Grace and Harold of not loving him anymore, but she denies that, saying they both love him very much. However, Mikey doesn't believe her; he picks up her blow dryer, turns it on, and begins to taunt her. He throws it into the water and she is instantly electrocuted.  Mikey goes downstairs and pours marbles onto the floor. When his foster father Harold arrives home, he calmly goes to greet him. They sit and talk for a moment until Harold sees his daughter floating lifelessly in the pool. He rushes towards the door, but slips on the marbles Mikey had laid down earlier. After Harold crashes through the door panel, Mikey proceeds to kill him by beating him in the head with a baseball bat. It is then revealed that Mikey has been taping the murders in secret. Soon after, the police have arrived to find Mikey "hiding" in a closet. He tells them a man came in and killed his family.  A psychiatrist recommends that Mikey be fostered as soon as possible. His foster mother's sister is put forward as a prospective foster carer, but she does not want anything to do with Mikey. She states that he was adopted, and that it was suspected that he was abused by members of his family.  Mikey is fostered by Neil and Rachel Trenton, who don't know about Mikey's past. Mikey initially seems an amiable and loving child, asking, "Are you going to be my new mommy and daddy?" when he first meets the Trentons and exhibiting caring behavior towards his new mother's fish. However, soon Mikey begins to draw pictures of his murders, which his foster parents don't recognize. He also begins to self-mutilate his arm with a thumbtack at school. His teacher notices, and tells his foster parents, who refuse to believe it. Mikey becomes irate when his new mother sells the baby fish he was placed in charge of feeding. He yells that she doesn't really love him and that she's not his real mother, and Neil is not his real father. Another incident occurs shortly after when Mikey walks in on his mother in the bath. He says he was bringing her flowers for being such a great mom, and then sets the flowers down and picks up her curling iron. He tells her he knows that if he threw it in the water, it would electrocute her like an electric chair. She tells him to unplug it and leave. He does so without complaint.  Mikey then falls in love with his new best friend, Ben's older sister, Jessie. She, however, is not interested in him as she is 15 years old and is dating a young man named David. One night, after Mikey had slingshot rocks at Jessie's window, David is told to leave. Mikey murders Jessie's cat, Rosie, but makes it look as if David had accidentally killed her. Depressed and angry, Jessie breaks up with David. However, they later get back together; upon Mikey’s discovery of this he tricks Jessie into leaving David alone in the hot tub. Mikey yells at David for killing Rosie and kicks a stereo into the water; David is killed instantly. Once again, Mikey films the murder.  The next day, Mikey is allowed to stay home from school. He sits, with Jessie telling her not to be sad because David deserved to die for killing Rosie. Jessie tells him it’s “sick” and Mikey responds, "Now you can just love me." She tells Mikey to leave her alone when he tries to embrace her. Suspecting Mikey killed David, Jessie goes to Rachel and tells her something is wrong with Mikey and that she is in danger. Assuming Jessie is simply stressed over David, Rachel politely asks her to leave.  Mikey's teacher Shawn, who is also a family friend, discovers the connection between Mikey's previous foster mother and David. She informs Mr. Jenkins, who tells her he will go to with her to talk to the family. He finds a gun in her purse and immediately takes it.  Meanwhile, Mikey hears the argument between Rachel and Jessie. Rachel goes upstairs and finds Mikey watching a movie. He tells her he's watching ‘Mikey's Funniest Home Movies’. She realizes that it is the taping of David's murder. Mikey stands, holding a hammer. Rachel demands that Mikey give it to her and he agrees. He pretends to hand it over before smashing her hand. He begins to beat her with the hammer. She pushes him down and says it's over. He continues to beat and she begs "no more!"; she manages to lock herself in her bedroom. She tries to call for help, but the phone does not work. Mikey smashes through the patio door. He picks up a shard of glass and rushes towards Rachel with it. They both fly off the balcony and are soon discovered by Shawn and Mr. Jenkins. Rachel's throat is slit and Mikey appears to have no pulse. Mr. Jenkins says he will go in and call the police and Shawn says she'll wait. When he goes in, he realizes Mikey is not there. He sets his gun on the counter to call the police. Mikey comes in with a bow and arrow; Mr. Jenkins tries to shoot, but Mikey took the bullets from the gun. Mikey then shoots him through the heart with an arrow. Shawn comes in and Mikey starts to sling marbles at her with his slingshot. He tells her he really liked her marble game and then proceeds to take a larger than average marble and hit her in the head. She dies instantly.  Mikey begins to take all the dead bodies and put them at the dinner table. He also turns all the oven dials on high. His father calls and tells him he'll be home soon. Mikey then showers and goes over to Jessie's house. He asks if Ben is home. She tells him no and to go home. She slams the door and runs upstairs only to be greeted by Mikey who climbed in through his "secret" way. She tells him to use the front door to leave and locks her door. When she opens the door, Mikey shoots an arrow at her. It misses and hits a picture that once had her and David on it, but Mikey puts a photo of himself in David's place.  Hearing his dad's car pull in, Mikey rushes to greet him. Jessie tries to yell from the window, but Neil doesn't hear her and goes inside. Once inside, they chit chat for a moment. Mikey then grabs his dad's arm telling him there's a surprise. His father sees all of the murder victims, Rachel, Shawn and Mr. Jenkins along with a skeleton at the table. Speechless and unable to move, Neil's last vision is that of Mikey lighting a Molotov cocktail and throwing it into the house and the house explodes. Jessie is seen talking to cops who assure her they found the remains of a 10-year-old male.  Later, another couple is about meet their adoptive child, Josh, who was found wandering and suffering from complete amnesia. Josh is revealed to be Mikey who faked his death after the explosion incident and again asks, "Are you going to be my new mommy and daddy?"

When Spengo peeks at the laser's planned point of impact (a [[Southern California]] suburb), he beholds housewife Marge Nelson ([[Teri Garr]]) and instantly falls in love. Using his Magnobeam (a giant magnet), he kidnaps Marge and her husband Dick ([[Jeffrey Jones]]) on their way to their 20th-anniversary weekend, hoping to make Marge his wife.  Dick and Marge get separated on Spengo: Marge is sent to the lap of luxury, waited on by servants with fish or dog heads, while Dick is thrown into a dungeon. In his cell, Dick meets the rightful king of Spengo, Raff ([[Eric Idle]]), who gives him plans for his son, called the White Bird, leader of a band of rebels out in the desert. In the meantime, Spengo finds that his advances towards Marge are failing, so he tries to read Dick's mind in order to discover the secret to her heart before having him executed. Upon witnessing Dick's devotion to Marge, Spengo's interrogator, Sibor ([[Wallace Shawn]]), has a change of heart and helps Dick escape. Despite the stupidity of his captors, Dick is soon discovered and forced down a garbage chute to the sewers, where he encounters a pack of carnivorous mushroom-like creatures called Lub-Lubs and is forced to run for his life.  Dick manages to escape the sewers and steal an escape pod, and winds up crashing in the desert, where he meets the rebels led by King Raff's son, Sirk ([[Dwier Brown]]), and daughter, Semage ([[Kathy Ireland]]), all of them dressed as 6-foot-tall birds, although such creatures are not naturally found on Spengo. At first, the rebels don't trust Dick; but when Dick reveals that he shared a cell with Raff and that he is on their side, their attitude quickly changes, and Dick rises to the rank of war leader. Using what little resources he can scrounge up, he devises a plan to sneak back into Spengo's palace and save Marge. In the meantime, General Afir, the only intelligent person among Spengo's forces and resentful of his emperor's antics, believes that Dick and Marge are the key to ending Spengo's rule, so he switches the love serum meant for Marge with water and informs her of his intentions to recover Dick. However, Spengo overhears Afir's plan and has him placed in the barrel of the laser, to die when the weapon is fired at Earth.  While Spengo's wedding with Marge is prepared, a detachment of Spengo's soldiers go into the desert to finish the rebels, but find their camp deserted, and one by one they fall victim to a Light Grenade (which desintegrates anyone touching it) left on Dick's pallet. Simultaneously, Dick and the rebels approach Spengo's fortress inside a large [[Trojan Horse|wooden bust]] of Spengo, which Spengo has brought into the chapel, and in the midst of the wedding ceremony the rebels emerge from the Trojan bust. As fighting rages in the castle, Spengo retreats to his lab with Marge and prepares to fire the laser at Earth. Dick and Tod clash with swords, but neither gains the upper hand. Marge manages to free herself and help Dick throwing Spengo into the sewers, where he is eaten by the Lub-Lubs. At the last second, Dick and Marge manage to shut down the laser, saving Afir and the Earth.  With Tod deceased, Raff is reinstated as the rightful king, and he reverses the polarity on the Magnobeam to send Dick and Marge back to Earth. Upon arriving home, Dick and Marge proceed to show their son ([[Danny Cooksey]]), daughter (Suzanne Ventulett), and her boyfriend Carl ([[Michael Stoyanov]]) slides (including an image of their space journey to Planet Spengo) from what they claim is "[[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]". To end their anniversary, they share drinks on the roof, watching the stars.

Mistress (1992 film)

The project also puts a strain on the marriage of Marvin and his long-patient wife Rachel ([[Laurie Metcalf]]).

Mr. Baseball
  Jack Elliot is an aging American [[Major League Baseball|baseball]] player unsuspectingly put on the trading block during Spring Training in 1992 by the [[New York Yankees]] in favor of "rookie phenom" first baseman Ricky Davis (played by [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Frank Thomas (AL baseball player)|Frank Thomas]]), and there's only one taker: the [[Nagoya]] [[Chunichi Dragons]] of Japan's [[Nippon Professional Baseball]].  Upon arrival in Japan, the arrogant Elliot clashes with the [[Japanese culture]] and the team's manager, and before long he alienates his new teammates.  He believes the rules and management style of his new skipper, Uchiyama ([[Ken Takakura]]), are ludicrous, and continues to do things his way, which leads his already dwindling performance to suffer even more.  His only ally on the team is another American ballplayer, Max "Hammer" Dubois ([[Dennis Haysbert]]), with whom he commiserates about his frustrations, but even Max becomes fed up with Jack's attitude and lack of respect for the game and his team. At the same time, Elliot develops a relationship with the beautiful Hiroko ([[Aya Takanashi]]), who is, he later learns, Uchiyama's daughter.  After one too many outbursts, including knocking out his interpreter during a brawl, Elliot is suspended from play. After meeting Hiroko's family, including Uchiyama, Uchiyama admits to Jack that he hired him over the objections of management and now his own career, not just Jack's, is in jeopardy. After hearing this, Elliot swallows his pride and admits his deficiencies. Uchiyama becomes his mentor.  In a rare show of humility, he apologizes to the team in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (erroneously saying he wants to build a "chopstick" rather than a "bridge" of friendship) and the team rallies around him and teaches him the value of sportsmanship and respect for hard work. Uchiyama lifts his suspension and begins to work with Elliot on improving his play. The reinvigorated Elliot's enthusiasm for team play is contagious and the mediocre Dragons become contenders for the [[Central League]] pennant. In the process, he also utilizes a Japanese tradition of being able to tell off Uchiyama while intoxicated to convince him to encourage his players to be more aggressive and "have a little fun."  Eventually, Elliot gets the opportunity to break Uchiyama's record of seven consecutive games with a home run, but not before his positive response to a call from his American agent complicates his relationship with Hiroko. His newfound respect for team play becomes apparent in a crucial game against the [[Yomiuri Giants]]. With the bases loaded, two outs and his team down 6–5, the team brass expects Uchiyama to signal for a bunt to try to tie the game, even though it would deny Elliot the chance to break the home run record.  Elliot goes to Uchiyama and asks if he read the sign correctly.  Uchiyama nods and tells him to swing away, knowing that a home run would break his record. Elliot takes a called strike one with a questionable call on the first pitch.  Elliot fouls the second pitch back.  Faced with a no-ball, two-strike count, Elliot sees the Giants' infield is playing deep and bunts.  The Giants are caught off-guard and the bunt is successful in allowing the tying run to cross home plate. As the Giants struggle to field the ball, Elliot, approaching first base, veers slightly inside the baseline and knocks over the Giants' pitcher covering first on the play, which allows the winning run to score from second base.  With the Dragons winning the pennant, Uchiyama can keep his job and Max ends his five-year career in NPB by signing with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Elliot, who marries Hiroko, becomes a coach and mentor with the [[Detroit Tigers]]. The movie ends with one of the players calling him Chief, which is the same as he called Uchiyama in Japan.

The Muppet Christmas Carol
  On [[Christmas Eve]], in 19th Century [[London]], [[Charles Dickens]] (played by [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo the Great]]) and his friend [[Rizzo the Rat|Rizzo]] act as [[narrator]]s throughout the film. [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] ([[Michael Caine]]), a surly money-lender, does not share the merriment of Christmas. Scrooge rejects his nephew Fred's invitation to Christmas dinner, dismisses two gentlemen's collecting money for charity, and tosses a wreath at a carol singing [[Bean Bunny]]. His loyal employee [[Bob Cratchit]] (played by [[Kermit the Frog]]) and the other bookkeepers request to have Christmas Day off since there will be no business for Scrooge on the day, to which he reluctantly agrees. Scrooge leaves for home while the bookkeepers celebrate Christmas. In his house, Scrooge encounters the ghosts of his late business partners [[Jacob Marley|Jacob and Robert Marley]] (played by [[Statler and Waldorf]]), who warn him to repent his wicked ways or he will be condemned in the afterlife like they were, informing him that three spirits will visit him during the night.  At one o'clock, Scrooge is visited by the childlike [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] who takes him back in time to his childhood and early adult life, Dickens and Rizzo hitching a ride too. They visit his lonely school days, and then his time as an employee under Fozziwig ([[Mr. Fezziwig]] from the original story, played by [[Fozzie Bear]]), who owned a [[rubber chicken]] factory. Fozziwig and his mother throw a Christmas party, where Scrooge meets a young woman named Belle, whom he falls in love with. However, the Ghost shows Scrooge how Belle left him when he chose money over her. A tearful Scrooge dismisses the Ghost as he returns to the present.  At two o'clock, Scrooge meets the gigantic, merry [[Ghost of Christmas Present]] who shows him the joys and wonder of Christmas Day. Scrooge and the Ghost visit Fred’s house where Scrooge is made fun of. Scrooge and the spirit then visit Bob Cratchit's house, learning his family is content with their small dinner, Scrooge taking pity on Bob's ill son [[Tiny Tim (A Christmas Carol)|Tiny Tim]] (played by [[List of Muppets#Robin the Frog|Robin the Frog]]). The Ghost of Christmas Present abruptly ages, commenting that Tiny Tim will likely not survive until next Christmas. Scrooge and the Ghost go to a cemetery, where the latter fades away. The [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]] then approaches Scrooge, appearing as a tall, silent cloaked figure. While Dickens and Rizzo abandon the audience to avoid being frightened, the Ghost takes Scrooge into the future.  Scrooge and the Ghost witness a group of businessmen discussing the death of an unnamed colleague where they would only attend the funeral if lunch is provided. In a den, Scrooge recognizes his [[charwoman]], his laundress, and the local [[Funeral director|undertaker]] trading several stolen possessions of the deceased to a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] named Old Joe. The Ghost transports Scrooge to Bob's house, discovering Tiny Tim has died. Scrooge is escorted back to the cemetery, where the Ghost points out his own grave, revealing Scrooge as the man who died. Realizing this, Scrooge decides to change his ways.  Awakening in his bedroom on Christmas Day, Scrooge decides to surprise Bob's family with a turkey dinner, and ventures out with Bean, Dickens, Rizzo, and the charity workers to spread happiness and joy around London. Scrooge goes to the Cratchit house, at first putting on a stern demeanor, and then revealing he intends to raise Bob's salary and pay off his mortgage. Dickens narrates how Scrooge became a secondary father to Tiny Tim, who escaped death. Scrooge, the Cratchits, and the neighborhood celebrate Christmas.  
Munchie
 Gage Dobson is a young boy dealing with various problems in his life. He is constantly bullied at school (by his fellow students AND the teachers), his widowed mother, Cathy, is dating the "creep" Dr. Elliot Carlisle, with whom Gage has a mutual hatred, and the girl he adores, Andrea, doesn't seem to know he exists. Gage's only friend is Professor Cruikshank, whom everyone considers a crackpot. After wandering into an abandoned mine, Gage finds a creature that calls itself Munchie. Gage runs home, frightened by the creature, only to find that Munchie has followed him home. Munchie explains to his new "pal" that he has magical powers and can help him out with the problems in his life.   Munchie's "help," however, only causes Gage more trouble. Munchie helps him get revenge on the school bullies (one is continually humiliated during a performance of Romeo & Juliet, the other is beaten up in the wash room) but he also helps to embarrass the school principal, who threatens Gage with expulsion. Fed up with Munchie's machinations, Gage takes him to Cruikshank, who reveals that Munchie is an eternal creature that has been in every major civilization since time began. Gage leaves Munchie with Cruikshank, only to have Munchie return to his house and put together a huge party while Cathy and Dr. Carlisle are on a date. The party is a big hit; Gage's principal, who attends, tells him he won't have to worry about expulsion, and Andrea and Gage finally get a chance to talk and they hit it off well.  While Cathy and Carlisle are on their date, Carlisle manages to disgust her with his misogynistic attitudes ("thirty something divorcees with children are a glut on today's market") and she demands he take her home early. They arrive and find the party in full swing. Cathy is furious with Gage, but when Carlisle finds a sleeping Munchie, he kidnaps him to take him to his office for experiments. With the help of Andrea and Cruikshank, Gage manages to get Munchie back and a chase ensues, culminating with Carlisle crashing into a donut shop and getting arrested by nearby cops.  Munchie leaves to join Cruikshank on a foreign expedition, promising Gage that they'll see each other again someday.

My Cousin Vinny
 Driving through Alabama in their 1964 Buick Skylark convertible, Billy Gambini and Stan Rothenstein, college students from New York who just got scholarships to UCLA, shop at a convenience store and accidentally shoplift a can of tuna. After they leave, the store clerk is robbed and killed, and Billy and Stan are arrested for the murder. Due to [[circumstantial evidence]] and a confession to the shoplifting that is misconstrued as one to the shooting, Billy is charged with murder, and Stan as an accessory. Billy's mother reminds him there is an attorney in the family: his cousin Vinny. Vincent LaGuardia Gambini travels there, accompanied by his fiancée, Mona Lisa Vito. Although he is willing to take the case, Vinny is a [[personal injury lawyer]] from Brooklyn, newly admitted to the bar, and with no trial experience.  Vinny manages to fool the trial judge, Chamberlain Haller, about being experienced enough for the case. His ignorance of basic courtroom procedures, dress code, and his abrasive attitude cause the judge to repeatedly hold him in [[Contempt of Court|contempt]]. Much to his clients' consternation, Vinny does not cross-examine any of the witnesses in the [[preliminary hearing]]. Except for lack of a murder weapon, it appears that the district attorney, Jim Trotter III, has a strong case that will lead to convictions. After Vinny's poor showing at the hearing, Stan fires him and uses the public defender, John Gibbons, and nearly convinces Billy to do the same.  Despite his missteps, Vinny shows that he is able to make up for his inexperience with an aggressive and perceptive questioning style. Vinny quickly discredits the testimony of the first three witnesses, and Billy and Stan's faith is restored.  On the trial's third day, Trotter produces a surprise witness, FBI analyst George Wilbur, who testifies that the pattern and chemical analysis of the tire marks left at the crime scene are identical to the tires on Billy's Buick. With only the lunch recess to prepare his cross-examination and unable to come up with a strong line of questioning, Vinny lashes out at Lisa. However, Vinny realizes that one of Lisa's photos holds the key to the case: the flat and even tire marks going over the curb reveal that Billy's car could not have been used for the getaway.  After requesting a records search from the local sheriff, Vinny drags Lisa into court to testify as an expert witness. During Vinny's questioning, Lisa testifies that only a car with an independent rear suspension and [[Limited-slip differential|positraction]] could have made the tire marks, which rules out Billy's 1964 Buick Skylark. However, one model of car with these features is the similar-looking 1963 Pontiac Tempest. Vinny re-calls George Wilbur, who confirms this. Vinny then re-calls the local sheriff, who testifies that two men who fit Billy and Stan's descriptions were just arrested in Georgia for driving a stolen green Pontiac Tempest, and were in possession of a gun of the same caliber used to kill the clerk. Trotter moves to dismiss all charges. The judge congratulates Vinny and, as they drive away, he and Lisa bicker about their wedding plans.

Naked Killer
 Kitty ([[Chingmy Yau]]) is a vicious young woman who has no qualms about stabbing girlfriend-bullying men in the [[Penis|genitals]]. Tinam ([[Simon Yam]]) is a cop who is undergoing a rather traumatic period: he shot his own brother by accident and as a result vomits every time he handles his gun.  When Kitty severely injures a man by stabbing him in the groin, Tinam attempts to arrest her but fails. Kitty later turns up at the police station and manipulates the facts to the point that Tinam has no choice but to start a relationship with her. This reveals Kitty as a subtle manipulator. Tinam, who has become [[impotent]], finds that he no longer feels the same way about Kitty, who is content with leading him on.  Kitty's father is married to a new wife but the marriage is tense. One evening he catches her cheating on him with another man called Bee ([[Ken Lo]]). In the fight that follows, Kitty's father falls down the stairs and is killed.  Furiously determined to seek revenge, Kitty breaks into Bee's office and proceeds to kill him, his bodyguards and most of his staff (there is some indication that he is involved with [[organised crime]]). In the course of her escape she takes a woman hostage but, unexpectedly, the woman helps her out, disposing of many of the pursuers herself.  The woman turns out to be Sister Cindy ([[Wai Yiu]]) who is in fact a professional [[assassin]]. She was out to kill Bee herself before Kitty intercepted. Seeing that Kitty has potential, she proceeds to train her and gives her a new identity. The training includes the killing of enraged, chained-up [[paedophile]]s in Sister Cindy's cellar. Before long, the pupil outsmarts the teacher.  For her first mission, Kitty accompanies Sister Cindy and murders a member of the Japanese [[yakuza]]. This leads to a contract being placed on them and the assignment is entrusted to Princess ([[Carrie Ng]]), one of Sister Cindy's former protégés and a [[lesbian]] with an equally deadly young lover called Baby ([[Madoka Sugawara]]).  While investigating the murder himself, Tinam goes to check up on an [[air hostess]] whom the victim met prior to his death. The witness is Vivian Shang, who Tinam recognises as Kitty. She denies this but renews their relationship.  Sister Cindy proceeds to murder other people who could connect Kitty to Vivian Shang, including Tinam's superior and a witness to the groin-stabbing incident. Kitty does however stop her from killing Tinam himself. Kitty and Tinam consummate their relationship, but their different professions means that it will be difficult for things to go any further.  Sister Cindy for her part decides that Kitty has lost the killer touch, but on the other hand has found happiness with Tinam, and tells her to leave and make the most of it.  Princess, who is supposed to kill Kitty, becomes obsessed for her, leading to some conflict with Baby. They set about killing Sister Cindy who, with death approaching, puts up a good fight. But she is ultimately defeated due to a ploy used by Princess earlier that day. Princess had kissed Sister Cindy with poisonous lipstick, which, combined with some wine she has drunk, kills her.  Kitty goes into hiding but later confronts Princess, apparently willing to become her partner both in business and in bed. Princess subsequently falls into the same trap she set for Sister Cindy: when they kiss, Kitty passes on some poisoned lipstick of her own. Tinam then bursts in, shooting away at Princess' henchmen, apparently having overcome his vomiting problems.  In the battle, Tinam kills Baby and a furious Princess pursues him and Kitty back to Sister Cindy's home. The poison in her system catches up with her however and she dies with Kitty taunting her by claiming that she on the other hand will get to hospital in time to survive.  By this time, the poison inside Kitty has taken effect. Unwilling to lose her again, Tinam fires his gun into the [[gas oven]] causing the house to go up in flames with the two of them inside.

Nemesis (1992 film)
 In the near future, illegal [[androids]] have become commonplace, and many criminals will enhance themselves with cybernetic components, making them "more than human". Alex Raine ([[Olivier Gruner]]) is a disillusioned [[assassination|assassin/bounty hunter]] for the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]]. During a routine mission, he is attacked by a group of cyborg freedom fighters known as The Red Army Hammerheads. Nearly killed by the surviving leader, Rosaria ([[Jennifer Gatti]]), Alex resists her assertion that he is a mindless robot: "Eighty-six point five percent [of him] is still human."  After months of cybernetic reconstruction and recovery, Alex tracks Rosaria to Old Baja and kills her. Soon after this, his handlers show up - his former lover Jared ([[Marjorie Monaghan]]), who is an [[android (robot)|android]], and another android, Sam. Alex decides he has had enough and leaves the LAPD, becoming a freelance hustler and triggerman. However, his LAPD bosses are just letting him run free for a while. After he is shot and badly wounded on a job, his old boss, Commissioner Farnsworth ([[Tim Thomerson]]), has him kidnapped and brought in for one final assignment. According to Germaine ([[Nicholas Guest]]), Jared has stolen vital security information regarding an upcoming summit between Japan and the United States, and must be stopped before she leaks the plans to the Red Army Hammerheads. Alex is told by Farnsworth that a bomb was implanted in his heart during his latest repairs. He is given three days to find Jared before she meets with the leader of the Hammerheads, Angie-Liv ([[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]]); otherwise, the bomb will detonate and kill him. After flying to the island of Shang-Lu in the Pacific Rim, he is turned loose as bait for Jared.  In reality, the freedom fighters are not battling against government control of people's lives, but for humanity's future. A newly designed android is infiltrating the higher echelons of human society, [[mind uploading|copying the minds]] of powerful leaders into synthetic bodies, Farnsworth among them. Jared threatens their plans, and so Alex's real mission is to smoke her out for the synthetics to destroy. Burnt out, Alex halfheartedly begins his search, checking into a local hotel. He is soon intercepted by Julian ([[Deborah Shelton]]), a [[cyborg]] representing Jared. She tells him he is being followed by an LAPD strike team led by Farnsworth, waiting for the opportunity to hit the Hammerheads and Jared.  It turns out that Jared was fatally wounded in her escape from LA, requiring her memory core to be salvaged from her body. After removing a surveillance device implanted in Alex's eye, Julian injects him with a digital scrambler that prevents the bomb from being remotely detonated. She gives him Jared's memory core, enabling him to talk to her. The strike team storms the hotel and Julian sacrifices herself to let Alex escape.  Alex eventually joins up with a local woman, Max (Merle Kennedy) who acts a scout for the Hammerheads while fronting as a tour guide. She is also the sister of Rosaria, the woman he'd killed in Old Baja. While she wants Alex dead, her loyalty to the freedom fighters comes first. He is brought to the Hammerheads and is convinced by Angie-Liv to join their cause. Unfortunately, the strike team tracks them down, leading to a shootout and chase through the rundown city. Most of the Hammerheads, including Angie-Liv, are killed by Farnsworth's men. Alex saves Max's life, eventually earning her forgiveness. In a confrontation with Farnsworth, Alex shoots him with a grenade launcher, apparently killing him.  Alex and Max arrive at a secret hangar where Yoshiro ([[Yuji Okumoto]]), a surviving Hammerhead, is waiting. While launching their escape vehicle, an aerodyne, they are attacked by the cyborg Farnsworth, reduced to his mechanical [[endoskeleton]]. Alex defeats him, but suffers grave injuries in the process and discovers just how much of him really is synthetic. Alex brings Jared's core to another Hammerhead compound where they will be able to destroy the labs being used to duplicate people. Unfortunately this means wiping her memory from the core, effectively killing her. Heavily bandaged and temporarily blind, Alex is forced to say goodbye.  Sneaking into LA and hunting down the synthetic agents, Alex corners Germaine on the helipad of LAPD headquarters. Despite Germaine's protests that he cannot hope to kill all the synthetics, Alex shoots him. Before she died, Jared told Alex that the real Commissioner Farnsworth left him a letter at an old dead drop. In it, his former mentor apologizes for his sometimes rough treatment, reminding him that they all have to do what is right. Alex walks off with his new partner Max, and they joke about how they are going to smuggle his synthetic body through airport customs: "Piece by piece, Max..."

Newsies
 In 1899, 17-year-old Jack "Cowboy" Kelly is one of many struggling [[newspaper hawker]]s in New York City, selling copies of the ''[[New York World]]'' on the streets of [[Manhattan]]. When David Jacobs and his younger brother Les join the "newsies", Jack notices David's intelligence and Les' marketable cuteness and self-servingly takes them under his wing. Jack is invited to the Jacobs' home, becomes enamored of their sister Sarah, and sings of his desire to escape to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].  Attempting to outdo his business rival [[William Randolph Hearst]], ''New York World'' publisher [[Joseph Pulitzer]] raises the prices that the newsies must pay to buy newspapers from his distribution centers. Angered, Jack and David galvanize the other Manhattan newsies to go on [[strike action|strike]]. While the others spread the word to newsies in [[Borough (New York City)|New York's other boroughs]], Jack and Les confront Pulitzer and are thrown out of his office. Bryan Denton, a reporter for ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', takes an interest in the boys' story. Jack and David take their cause to the [[Brooklyn]] newsies, but their leader, "Spot" Conlon, is reluctant to join the strike. This dejects the Manhattan newsies, but David riles them up until they ambush the distribution center and destroy all of the newspapers. Disabled newsie "Crutchie" is captured by Pulitzer's enforcers, the Delancey brothers, and placed in an [[orphanage]] called the Refuge, run by the sketchy Warden Snyder, who neglects the orphans so that he can embezzle money given to him by the city for their care.  The newsies try to ward off [[strikebreaker]]s, but the struggle turns violent and turns out to be a trap set by the Delanceys. Just as the newsies are about to be arrested, Spot Conlon arrives with the Brooklyn newsies and the two groups unite to repel the police. Denton puts the story on the front page of ''The Sun'', and the newsies plan to hold a rally. Snyder informs Pulitzer that Jack is an escapee from the Refuge, giving Pulitzer legal cause to have him arrested. Jack has breakfast with Sarah on the roof of the Jacobs' apartment building; he tells her of his desire to flee to Santa Fe, and wonders if she would miss him.  The police break up the rally and arrest the newsies, but Denton steps in to pay their legal fines. Snyder testifies against Jack and reveals to the others that Jack's real name is Francis Sullivan; his mother is deceased and his father incarcerated. Jack is sentenced to four years of rehabilitation in the Refuge. Denton is reassigned as a [[war correspondent]] and can no longer report on the strike. Jack is taken to see Pulitzer, who offers to waive his sentence and pay him a salary if he will work as a strikebreaker. When Pulitzer threatens to have the other newsies thrown into the Refuge, Jack complies. The boys attempt to rescue Jack, but he tells them to leave.  The newsies are shocked and dismayed to see Jack report for work the next day. When the Delanceys attack the Jacobs children, Jack steps in to save them, knowing this will break his deal with Pulitzer. The newsies learn from Denton that their strike has had little effect on public opinion, since the city thrives on [[child labor]] and Pulitzer has ordered newspapers not to report on the strike. Using an old printing press of Pulitzer's, they publish a "Newsie Banner" which they distribute to child workers citywide. Denton shares the paper with Governor [[Theodore Roosevelt]], exposing the mistreatment of children at the Refuge. Numerous child laborers join the strike, bringing the city's workforce to a standstill. Jack and David confront Pulitzer, who finally gives in to their demands.  Roosevelt has Snyder arrested, releases the children from the Refuge, and thanks Jack for alerting him to the situation. He offers Jack a ride, and Jack asks to be taken to the train yards so he can head to Santa Fe. The newsies are disheartened by this, but Jack returns shortly, having been convinced by Roosevelt that he still has things to accomplish in New York. As the newsies celebrate his return, Sarah and Jack kiss, and Spot gets a ride back to Brooklyn from Roosevelt.

Despite their extreme differences socially, the two develop a certain connection. When Victoria suggests that cab driving is not much a career, Corky counters that her dream in fact is to become a mechanic. During the ride Victoria, who is evidently a talent scout, comes to realise that Corky would be ideal for a part in a movie she is casting, but Corky rejects the offer because she intends to be a mechanic.  ===New York=== Helmut ([[Armin Mueller-Stahl]]), an immigrant from [[East Germany]] who was a clown in his home country, has found work as a taxi driver. After dark, he picks up a passenger named YoYo ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]), a streetwise young man who wants to go to Brooklyn. Increasingly alarmed at Helmut's inability to handle automatic transmission, ignorance of New York geography and feeble command of the English language, YoYo takes over the wheel. Helmut is glad to pick up tips from his fare on how to become part of the culture of his new home. On the street in skimpy clothing, YoYo sees his sassy sister-in-law Angela ([[Rosie Perez]]) and forces her into the car to take her back home. Helmut is amused and instructed by the vituperation flowing between the two. When they are dropped off, he faces the problem of mastering the gears and navigating back to Manhattan.  ===Paris=== At night, a cab picks up two drunk African diplomats, who mock the lowly driver ([[Isaach De Bankolé]]) and find it hilarious that he is from the [[Ivory Coast]]. In French, when he says he is ''ivoirien'', they say ''il voit rien'' (he can't see a thing). Sick of their insults, he throws them out without making them pay. Next he picks up an attractive young woman ([[Béatrice Dalle]]), who is blind. As she cannot see the colour of his skin, he asks her where she thinks he is from. After a moment's thought, she says ''the Ivory Coast''. Prickly and sexually provocative, she rejects most of his efforts to be friendly, regarding him as beneath her, but he is genuinely fascinated by her and her predicament. So much so that, after dropping her off, he watches her walk beside a canal in the dark and drives into another car, whose driver angrily accuses him of being blind.  ===Rome=== In the early morning hours, an eccentric cabbie ([[Roberto Benigni]]) picks up a priest ([[Paolo Bonacelli]]). As he drives, he starts to confess his sins. Much to the priest's discomfort, he goes into great detail about how he discovered his sexuality, first with a pumpkin and then with a sheep, then details a love affair he had with his brother's wife, miming the actions and mouthing the cries. Already ailing, overwhelmed by the barrage of unwanted information, the priest has a fatal heart attack. Unable to revive him, the cabbie leaves him on a bench to be found once it is light.  ===Helsinki=== After an evening spent drinking heavily, three workers ([[Kari Väänänen]], [[Sakari Kuosmanen]], and [[Tomi Salmela]]), one of whom has just been fired from his job and has passed out, climb into a cab to return home. On the way, the two conscious workers talk about the terrible situation their unconscious friend is in, being out of work and having to face a divorce and a pregnant daughter. The driver, Mika ([[Matti Pellonpää]]), then tells them all the saddest story they have ever heard. The workers are terribly moved and depressed by the story, and even become unsympathetic toward their drunken, laid-off companion. Leaving him in the cab, they pay up and stagger off to their homes. Mika drags him out and leaves him in the snow for someone to find.

Rebels, led by Chow's lover, swordswoman Yau Mo-yan, arrive to free them, but are attacked by East Factory troops.

The scene is set for a vicious battle of bodies and wits between both sides, with Jade trying to keep the peace and getting every advantage, monetary or otherwise, that she can get out of it. Meanwhile, the bulk of the East Factory forces, led by eunuch Tsao himself, are on their way to the inn.

 Harry Fabian (De Niro) is a fast-talking, two-bit New York lawyer who hangs out at a bar called Boxers, owned by Phil (Gorman) and his wife Helen (Lange). Harry has been having an affair with Helen, who dreams of setting up her own bar and leaving Phil. At the bar, he spots an article in the ''[[New York Post]]'' about a man who was pummeled by a boxer. He calls the man on Phil's phone and pitches a lawsuit against the boxer on the grounds that his fists are legally considered weapons. The fighter is promoted by Ira "Boom Boom" Grossman (King), who tries to muscle Harry off the idea of suing his boxer. The case is promptly dismissed by the judge, who knows that it is baseless.  Having seen the world of boxing up close, Harry decides to become a boxing promoter and files for a license. He recruits Boom Boom's estranged brother, former professional prizefighter Al Grossman (Warden), to be his partner. Boom Boom tries to muscle Harry out of the fight business, but when Al protects Harry, Boom Boom cowers in fear.  Al asks Phil for a $15,000 loan to cover the cost of the fight. Sensing her opportunity, Helen stages an argument with Harry and demands that he come up with $7,500, promising that Phil will match the amount. Helen fronts Harry the $7,500 herself, allowing Harry to secure the loan. Phil promises that he will pay Harry the money the day before the fight. She gives him another $5,000 to help her set up her own bar by procuring a liquor license. Harry has a friend in the Federal Liquor Administration who supplies him a blank license but asks $7500 for it; because Harry only has $5000, he has to have a printer put in the printed details, making the license essentially a fake. he gives Helen the licence but doesn't tell her all the details of how he got it.  Boom Boom tries one last time to persuade Harry to abandon the idea, offering him money to walk away from the fight business. Harry explains that he has spent his career in pursuit of quick and easy cases that can be settled for small cash amounts. He tells Boom Boom that he had a case once where the NYPD had mistakenly beaten up some people because they served a warrant on the wrong house. Instead of taking them to trial, he accepted the NYPD's offer of $20,000 to make the case go away. He insists that, for once, he is not going to take the money and run. Boom Boom threatens to kill Harry if anything happens to Al, who has already had two heart attacks.  After a nasty fight at Boxers, Helen finally leaves Phil.  Still set on keeping Harry out of promoting, Boom Boom meets with Phil and reveals that Helen has been sleeping with Harry. Enraged, Phil calls the state liquor authority to inform them that Harry had forged Helen's license. He pretends like everything is fine with Harry, and offers to throw a dinner party the night before the fight. After the party, he tells Harry that he will have the $7,500 the next day, which is the morning of the fight.  Helen wakes up Harry at his place, and they talk about their new endeavors. Her new bar is opening the night of his fight. Harry goes to Boxers and anxiously waits for Phil. When Phil arrives, Harry asks him for the money. Phil says he thought Harry was joking, and then he reveals that he knows about his affair with Helen, as he beats up Harry. Desperate to keep the fight afloat, Harry borrows $12,000 from the ruthless loan shark Mr. Peck (Wallach). At the venue, Al gets into a fight with one of the staff and has a fatal heart attack. With the fight off, Harry goes to Helen's new bar only to find that it has been shut down because of his forged license.  Boom Boom's goons show up to make good on his threat. Harry and Helen run and end up cornered in an alley. Harry tries to talk his way out of what is coming by explaining that the goons should be after the guy who fought with Al and caused his heart attack. He throws Peck's $12,000 in the air as the final exclamation point on his speech and walks Helen past the goons, asking her under his breath, "How'd I do?" The goons shoot Harry in the back and throw their pistols in a dumpster.  The film ends with Helen holding Harry's hand as he is put in an ambulance, still talking optimistically about the future.  
Noises Off (film)
 The film follows the concept of a [[play within a play]], in this case a dreadful  [[farce]] called ''Nothing On'' — the type of production in which many doors continually open and shut. The setting has been transplanted from English provincial theatre to [[Des Moines, Iowa]], where a second-rate theatrical troupe is preparing to perform the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-bound play under the direction of Lloyd Fellowes.  Among the cast members of ''Nothing On'' are fading star Dotty Otley, scatter-brained Garry Lejeune, insecure matinee heartthrob Frederick Dallas, [[myopia|myopic]] leading lady Brooke Ashton, second female lead Belinda Blair, and alcoholic [[character actor]] Selsdon Mowbray. Frantically working behind the scenes are Tim Allgood and Poppy Taylor.  The film opens with the final dress rehearsal before opening night, with the cast still forgetting lines, missing cues, and mishandling props. Lloyd is reduced to cajoling, yelling at, and pleading with them to get things right. Complicating matters are the personal problems and backstage relationships that have fostered jealousy and petty squabbling and intruded upon any professionalism this motley crew can muster.  As the company works its way to [[New York City]], the eccentricities of the cast come to the fore and the performances on the road dissolve into chaos on and backstage.

Despite Lennie's pleas to keep the dead mouse, George forcibly takes the mouse and throws it away, which causes Lennie to cry.

Lennie, sobbing hysterically, states that "there is no other mouse".  As they camp that evening, Lennie asks George to tell him again about their dream, as he has numerous times, and George reluctantly agrees.

That night, Nap-lan orders his men to disguise themselves as White Lotus Sect members and break into the consulate. After some time, he leads his soldiers into the consulate under the pretext of protecting the consul and arresting the cult members while actually using the opportunity to hunt down Lu. He secretly kills the British consul when the latter sees through his ruse.  Lu disguises himself as Leung and follows Wong out of the consulate, while Leung pretends to be Lu to lure Nap-lan and his soldiers away. Wong and Lu then travel to the White Lotus Sect's base to confront Priest Kau-kung, the cult leader. After fighting with the cult members and engaging Kau-kung in a one-on-one fight, Wong defeats Kau-kung and kills him by knocking him onto a protruding sharp point. Wong, Leung and Lu then proceed to retrieve a book, which contains the names of the revolutionaries, from a secret location, but they run into Nap-lan and his men. Lu is shot but manages to burn the book to prevent Nap-lan from getting it. Wong fights with Nap-lan while Leung helps Lu burn the book. Leung almost burns the cloth used to wrap the book. Before succumbing to his wounds, Lu stops Leung from burning the cloth and tells him to meet Sun Wen at the pier and pass him the cloth. Wong and Leung try to escape but are cornered by Nap-lan. In the end, Wong defeats and kills Nap-lan by cutting his throat with a wooden splinter. As dawn approaches, Wong and Leung arrive at the pier just as the ferry is leaving for Hong Kong. Wong throws the cloth to Sun Wen, who opens it up to reveal Lu's design of the [[Blue Sky with a White Sun]] flag.  
One False Move
 Three criminals, Ray, Pluto and Fantasia (Ray's girlfriend), commit six brutal murders over the course of one night in Los Angeles as they seek a cache of money and cocaine. The trio leave for Houston to sell the cocaine to a friend of Pluto's.  The [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Detectives Cole and McFeely are investigating the case. After getting a few leads, they discover that the three are possibly headed for [[Star City, Arkansas]]. The LAPD contacts the Star City police chief, Dale "Hurricane" Dixon, who is excited about the case, as it gives him an opportunity to do "some real police work". He is well-known throughout the small county, chatting with locals while on patrol. The detectives fly to Star City and meet Dixon. He attempts to ingratiate himself with the detectives, whom he reveres, while they pretend to respect him.  After stopping at a convenience store, a state trooper pulls over and attempts to arrest Ray and Pluto but Fantasia kills him as she is asked to get out of the car. Word of the trooper's murder gets to the detectives in Star City, and the trio review surveillance photos of Ray and Fantasia in the store confirming their identity. Dixon informs the detectives that Fantasia is Lila Walker and she grew up in Star City. He recalls she was a troubled youth who left for Hollywood with dreams of an acting career.  The detectives sense Dixon may know Fantasia better than he is letting on after they stop by her mother's house. They question Fantasia's mother and brother Ronnie about Fantasia's whereabouts and if she had contacted them recently. They also meet a young boy who is revealed to be Lila's young son. The detectives suspect that Lila will be coming home to see him.  Ray, Fantasia and Pluto arrive in Houston to sell the drugs as planned. Fantasia takes a bus to Star City. Angry that their buyers are reneging on the previously agreed upon price for the cocaine, Pluto and Ray kill them and flee. They drive to Star City to meet up with Fantasia and plan their next move.  When Fantasia arrives in Star City, she hides at a rural house. Dixon confronts her, and it is revealed that the boy is Dixon and Lila's son, conceived during an affair years earlier. After tense conversation, they make a deal. She will lure Ray and Pluto to ensure their arrest and in exchange, Dixon will help her leave town.  Pluto and Ray arrive at the house and are immediately confronted by an armed Dixon. Pluto stabs Dixon in the stomach and Dixon shoots Pluto. Ray draws his gun and runs outside while shooting at Dixon. The two fire at each other, but Fantasia stops Dixon from killing Ray, only to have Ray errantly shoot her in the head. Shot in the chest, Dixon steadies himself and shoots Ray, killing him. Pluto walks outside and falls dead in the grass. Dixon calls for help with his police radio, and the LAPD detectives arrive, amazed at what Dixon has accomplished. The boy walks over and talks to Dixon as he lies bleeding, and he asks the boy to tell him about himself.  
Once Upon a Time, Cinema
 The film follows a character known as The Cinematographer ([[Mehdi Hashemi (actor)|Mehdi Hashemi]]), who is looking for someone called Atieh (Future). As he calls out to her, he is magically transported back in time from the early twentieth century to the reign of [[Naser al-Din Shah]] in 19th century Iran. Captured by the Shah's guards, he shows films from the (future) history of Iranian cinema to the Shah ([[Ezzatolah Entezami]]). The Shah is entranced and eagerly shows his family the apparently magical medium.   While watching the film ''[[Lor Girl]]'' (1932), a melodrama about feisty girl attacked by bandits, the Shah becomes enamoured of the heroine, Golnar. Golnar ([[Fatemeh Motamed-Aria]]) then drops out of the film into the "real" world of the Shah's court. The Shah has his soldiers take her to his harem to become one of his many wives. Transported to the Shah by being sent down [[Naser al-Din Shah's slide|his harem slide]], Golnar rejects him, and attempts to escape, leading to a slapstick chase-scene.  Meanwhile the cinematographer is showing films to the Shah's wives. The Shah himself wants everyone to see ''Lor Girl''. There is a big open-air showing. Other films are also shown, notably the vigilante revenge drama ''[[Qeysar (film)|Qeysar]]'' (1969). The vigilante hero comes out of the film. The Shah talks to him about using him against his enemies, and confesses that his one true love in the harem was killed by his other jealous wives. Now he only dreams of Golnar. Meanwhile, disturbed by the disruptive power of cinema, the Shah's advisors meet to discuss how to censor this dangerous medium.  The Shah asks the cinematographer to turn him into Jafar, the hero of ''Lor Girl'', to win Golnar's love. The cinematographer uses his cinema magic on him, but instead turns the Shah into the protagonist of ''[[The Cow (film)|The Cow]]'' (1969), a film about a man believes he is a cow. He then instructs him to pull a plough to help a poor family. The cinematographer is arrested and condemned for insulting the Shah. As he is about to be executed, the full power of cinema is unleashed, blowing the court away. The film moves into colour, ending in a series of clips of people embracing.  
Orlando (film)
 The story begins in the [[Elizabethan era]], shortly before the death of [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. On her deathbed, the Queen promises an androgynous young nobleman named Orlando a large tract of land and a castle built on it, along with a generous monetary gift; both Orlando and his heirs would keep the land and inheritance forever, but Elizabeth will bequeath it to him only if he assents to an unusual command: "Do not fade. Do not wither. Do not grow old." Orlando acquiesces and reposes in splendid isolation in the castle for a couple of centuries, during which time he dabbles in poetry and art. His attempts to befriend a celebrated poet, however, backfire when the poet ridicules his verse. Orlando then travels to [[Constantinople]] as English ambassador to the Turks, and is almost killed in a diplomatic [[wikt:fracas|fracas]]. Waking up the next morning, he learns something startling: he has transformed into a woman.  The now ''Lady'' Orlando comes home to her estate in [[Middle East|Middle-Eastern]] attire, only to learn that she faces several impending lawsuits arguing that Orlando was a woman all along and therefore has no right to the land or any of the royal inheritance that the Queen had promised. The succeeding two centuries tire Orlando out; the court case, bad luck in love, and the wars of British history eventually bring the story to the present day (i.e., the early 1990s). Orlando now has a young daughter in tow and is in search of a publisher for her book. (The literary editor who judges the work as "quite good" is portrayed by the late [[Heathcote Williams]]—the same actor who played the poet who had, earlier in the film, denigrated Orlando's poetry.) Having lived a most bizarre existence, Orlando, relaxing with her daughter and daydreaming philosophically under a tree, has finally found a tranquil niche.  === Differences from the novel === Director [[Sally Potter]] described her approach to the adaptation as follows: <blockquote>My task […] was to find a way of remaining true to the spirit of the book and to Virginia Woolf's intentions, whilst being ruthless with changing the book in any way necessary to make it work cinematically… The most immediate changes were structural. The storyline was simplified [and[ any events which did not significantly further Orlando's story were dropped.<ref name="press_kit"></ref></blockquote>  The film contains some anachronisms not present in the novel. For example, upon Orlando's arrival in Constantinople in about the year 1700, England is referred to as a "green and pleasant land", a line from [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]'', which in reality was not written until 1804.<ref></ref> Also, Orlando receives a gift to celebrate the new century from [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], who had in fact not yet succeeded to the throne.  Potter argued that "whereas the novel could withstand abstraction and arbitrariness (such as Orlando's change of sex), cinema is more pragmatic."<ref name="press_kit"/> She continued,<blockquote>There had to be reasons—however flimsy—to propel us along a journey based itself on a kind of suspension of disbelief. Thus, Queen Elizabeth bestows Orlando's long life upon him, […] whereas in the book it remains unexplained. And Orlando's change of sex in the film is the result of his having reached a crisis point—a crisis of masculine identity.<ref name="press_kit" /></blockquote>At film's end, Orlando has a daughter, whereas in the novel she had a son.<ref name="press_kit" /> Potter has said that she intended Orlando's [[Fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]] to be an equivalent to Woolf's direct addresses to her readers, and that this was her attempt at converting Woolf's literary wit into a more 'cinematic' humor.<ref name="press_kit" /> One obvious similarity remained, however: the film ends in its present day, 1992,<ref name="press_kit" /> just as Woolf's novel ends in its present day, 1928.<ref></ref>

Passenger 57
 International psychopath [[Terrorism|terrorist]] Charles Rane (Payne), known as "The Rane of Terror", is caught by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and local authorities just as he is about to receive plastic surgery to alter his features to evade the law. The FBI make plans to return Rane to [[Los Angeles]] aboard a [[Lockheed L-1011 Tristar]] passenger aircraft,  for him to stand trial.  John Cutter (Snipes) is a retired [[ United States Secret Service]] agent who is trying to recover from the haunting memories of his wife's death in a convenience-store robbery, and has taken to training flight attendants in self defense, including Marti Slayton ([[Alex Datcher]]). After one class, Cutter is approached by an old friend, Sly Delvecchio ([[Tom Sizemore]]), who offers Cutter the vice presidency of a new antiterrorism unit for his company, Atlantic International Airlines. Cutter is reluctant, but Delvecchio and the company's president, Stuart Ramsey ([[Bruce Greenwood]]), convince him to accept the offer.  Cutter boards as the 57th passenger on an Atlantic International flight to Los Angeles, where Marti is one of the flight attendants. Rane and his two FBI escorts are also aboard. After the flight takes off, several men in Rane's employ, posing as flight attendants and passengers, kill the FBI agents, release Rane, and secure the plane by also shooting the captain. Cutter, in the lavatory at the time, manages to use the plane's on-board phone to warn Delvecchio of the situation, but Cutter is soon discovered by one of Rane's agents.  Cutter overpowers the agent and takes his weapon; he then uses the agent as a shield to confront Rane. Rane is indifferent and shows his ruthlessness by taking a passenger hostage and then killing him without mercy. Rane also shoots his own agent in a further show of force. Cutter realizes he is outmatched and escapes with Marti to the plane's cargo hold, dispatching another of Rane's men, Vincent, who is disguised as a caterer.  Cutter dumps the plane's fuel, forcing Rane to order the surviving pilots to land at a small [[Louisiana]] airfield. Cutter jumps from the plane as it lands, but Marti is caught by Rane and kept aboard. The local sheriff, Chief Leonard Biggs (Ernie Lively), arrests Cutter, thinking he is a terrorist, and takes him to the airport building.  Rane contacts the field's tower and demands refueling, for which he promises half the passengers will be freed. For every five minutes of resistance or indecision, Rane will order five passengers to be executed. Rane also asserts that Cutter is one of his own men turned against him. Biggs gives the go-ahead for refueling, and as the passengers are freed, Rane and his men escape from the plane, having given orders to those still on board to kill the rest of the hostages if their plans are interfered with. Cutter recognizes the passenger release as a diversion, escapes from the sheriff, and chases Rane and his men into a local county fair.  FBI agents arrive and confirm Cutter's true identity to Biggs. Cutter is able to kill one of Rane's men and gets into a fight with Rane before police arrive and capture him.  Back at the tower, Rane announces that if he does not contact the plane and give flight clearance, his men aboard have been instructed to kill the rest of the hostages. The FBI agents arrange to return Rane to the plane, escorted by two agents, with plans to have a sniper take down Rane and allow them to storm the plane to save the hostages. However, the sniper is Vincent, who kills the escorts, but is shot dead by Cutter, and Rane makes it inside safely. Rane orders the pilots to take off, while Cutter, with Biggs' help, manages to jump onto the speeding plane before it takes off.  Inside, Cutter deals with more of Rane's accomplices before getting into a fight with Rane. Their fight blows out one of the plane's windows, causing the bulkhead door to blow out due to the [[Cabin pressurization|explosive cabin decompression]]. Cutter manages to get Rane close to the open door and kicks him out of the plane, sending him plummeting to his death. The plane quickly returns to the airfield, where the FBI agents secure Rane's remaining agents and the remaining hostages are freed. Amid congratulations and celebration, Marti and Cutter make their quiet escape into the distance hand-in-hand, but not before Chief Biggs offers them a ride.

Parampara (1993 film)
  The wealthy Thakur Bhavani Singh ([[Sunil Dutt]]) lives in a remote region of India where he shares an intense rivalry with a local gypsy clan led by Gora Shankar ([[Anupam Kher]]). Parampara (tradition) dictates that differences are resolved with a single bullet pistol duel at the top of a hill. Years earlier, Bhavani Singh fought a duel against Gora Shankar's father and killed him.  Bhavani's son Prithvi ([[Vinod Khanna]]) returns from London and strikes up a friendship with Shankar and his clanmates, much to the dismay of his father. As Prithvi gets closer he falls in love with Shankar's sister Tara ([[Ramya Krishnan|Ramya Krishna]]). His father however has arranged Prithvi's marriage with the daughter of a fellow upper-class acquaintance. Prithvi is unable to make up his mind and ends up defiantly marrying Tara against his father's wishes - and subsequently marrying the girl of his father's choosing, Rajeshwari ([[Ashwini Bhave]]).  Later, Bhavani Singh discovers Tara has given birth to Prithvi's son and to his fury, orders his men to attack the gypsy colony and to kill Tara, her son and anyone who comes in the way. The Thakur's men set the camps ablaze, killing Tara but not her son, Ranvir. Shankar, who also survived the attack storms in to kill Bhavani Singh in revenge but he is arrested and imprisoned. Prithvi, tells his father that he will never acknowledge his presence again and despite living in the same house, his father will never hear his voice. Rajeshwari then presents him with the rescued Ranvir, earning the respect and love of her husband. Rajeshwari gives birth to a son Pratap, whom Bhavani Singh recognises as his true grandson. Both Ranvir and Pratap are brought up in the same household by Prithvi and Rajeshwari but both boys eventually realise that there is a difference between the two.  Gora Shankar is released from prison and returns to challenge Bhavani Singh to a pistol duel, but before the old man can respond, Prithvi intervenes and says the duel should be fought among equals and that Shankar should be duelling him, not his father. Shankar, who still sees Prithvi as his friend, reluctantly accepts and the duel is set for the next day.  Prithvi silently takes his father's blessing and heads to the hill alone. At the duel, both Shankar and Prithvi take their pistols and begin to pace away from each other. As the shot to turn and fire is heard, both men turn and aim - but only Shankar fires, shooting Prithvi in the chest. He runs immediately to Prithvi who reveals he never loaded his gun. As Prithvi dies, he tells Shankar to take Ranvir far away from his father, hoping no more blood will be shed in petty rivalry. At Prithvi's funeral, both Bhavani Singh and Gora Shankar draw their swords and challenge each other but are stopped by Rajeshwari. Shankar takes Ranvir and leaves the region for good.  Years later, both of Prithvi's sons meet in college as strangers, not knowing the identity of the other. Firstly rivals, the two become close friends but after Pratap ([[Saif Ali Khan]]) recognises Gora Shankar at Ranvir's ([[Aamir Khan]]) house, the two quickly realise that their past is linked but after years of being influenced by their respective guardians, they share a hatred of one another's families. Ranvir blames Bhavani Singh for killing his mother, while Pratap blames Shankar for killing his father.  Despite the efforts of Shankar and Rajeshwari to end the fighting which will only lead to tragedy, Ranvir ends up challenging his grandfather Bhanvi Singh to a duel. Pratap, echoing the words of his father years ago, states that the duel should be fought among equals and with that the challenge is set.  The next day Pratap arrives with Rajeshwari and Ranvir with Shankar. Just as the battle is about to start, Bhavani shows up on his horse to watch from a distance. The two brothers turn their back to each other and start to pace away. As they do this their grandfather watches them and begins to see visions of his son Prithvi as he looks at both Ranvir and Pratap. The signal to turn and shoot is given and both men turn and fire instinctively - only to see their grandfather between them having taken both their bullets. As Bhavani stumbles to the ground, he cries out for Prithvi, revealing the years of torment of losing his son. The brothers rush to the fallen old man who in his last moments tells them of his regret and hopes that with his death there is no further bloodshed.  After the funeral, Ranvir and Pratap are about to head their separate ways but stop to embrace each other as brothers for the first time.

When Appu returns home from his boarding school during vacation, Balachandran promises him a lot many things, but is unable to fulfill any of them as he is caught up with work. Meanwhile, Appu befriends his carer Meenakshi ([[Seena Dadi]]), much to the annoyance of Balachandran.  Meenakshi's half-brother Rudran, after realizing that his sister stays with Balachandran (who fired him for the murder of a colleague), forcefully takes her home. Appu becomes disappointed and turn rebellious, which culminates in Balachandran hitting him. He now realize that Bhama's death was tough on his son too. He apologize and promises to bring back Meenakshi.  At Meenakshi's house, her brother objects to Balachandran's request of taking her back and he see the way she is mistreated by her brother, leading to a fight between them where Appu gets caught up. The attempt fails and they retreat to their summer house, deciding to let go of the thoughts of Meenakshi. Appu now gets to spend more time with his father as he had always hoped, although he miss Meenakshi.

He informs that an urgent surgery is their only hope and his Professor, a famous neurosurgeon had been called from Mumbai for the surgery.  The unresolved cause of the bleeding puzzle the doctors. Balachandran soon recollects the fight and recall Rudran being the one responsible for Appu's condition. Enraged by the thought, he rush to seek revenge, but is stopped by Gopan by shouting that if he really loves his son, stay with him till the operation, take care of him and pray for him. The depth of his ignorance to his son, now becomes even more clear to him.

Parda Hai Parda (film)
  The film revolves around four happy-go-lucky friends and the predicament they fall into when they cross paths with a new girl in their neighborhood. At the onset, we see a suitcase of some significance being moved through the busy city. The bag is handed off by various men in suits until it reaches an older gentleman. The old man soon is pursued by some hoodlums. He narrowly escapes the thugs by hopping into a cab, only for the driver to stop the car in a secluded area. The mysterious driver then kills the old man dead with a gunshot and steals the bag and is shown running in the distance.  The film then begins to follow four friends in the same city. Vijay ([[Chunky Pandey]]), Appu Khote ([[Laxmikant Berde]]), Prem (Virendra Singh) and Thomas ([[Raj Zutshi]]) are a carefree bunch with no responsibilities that roam their part of town in search of fun and beautiful women.  The film takes a turn when they hear about a beautiful young woman that has just moved into their neighborhood with her grandparents. They are instantly allured by her good looks and start to make hilarious attempts to find out about her and why she is in town. In their quest to learn about the girl and impress her, they end up accidentally injuring Maya's grandfather and terrorizing her grandmother.  They discover that the girl, whose name is Maya ([[Meena (actress)|Meena]]) is visiting the city to get to the bottom of a mystery surrounding her dead brother, Raghuveer. In town, Maya is able to track down the mother ([[Reema Lagoo]]) of his brother's friend, Andrews. The mother had been anxiously awaiting the return of her son from a long leave of absence and in that time had met Maya's brother Raghuveer, who left a special package for her from her long-lost son. We later find out that this package is the suitcase seen at the beginning of the film.  All four friends after learning about Maya and her reasoning for visiting the town decide to lie and pretend that the four of them were good friends with Maya's brother Raghuveer and Andrews. After failed individual attempts to win her over, Maya eventually befriends the foursome. Once this happens, a powerful man by the name of John Honai ([[Kiran Kumar]]) appears to be stalking the four.  Honai tricks Vijay and his friends into coming to a warehouse, telling them that Maya wanted to meet them there. It is there that Vijay, Appu, Thomas and Prem are cornered by Honai and his gang of henchman. Honai, under the impression that the four are true friends of Andrews and Raghuveer, demands that they reveal the whereabouts of the suitcase bag. The four are confused by the interrogation and deny they know anything about this bag. After failing to escape the warehouse, Honai holds the four hostage and subjects them to torture until they give up the whereabouts of the bag.  Meanwhile, Maya tracks down Andrews old girlfriend (Malvika Tiwari), who is now currently a nun in a convent. The nun spills the story that Maya was looking for.

Soon thereafter, Raghuveer finds Andrews dead body at the shore of a beach and vows to get revenge. Raghuveer brings the bag to John Honai and tries to kill Honai, but fails after he's choked to death by Honai's henchmen with a rope as he has Honai in a chokehold.

Vijay and his friends find out that they are in big trouble as the police are now also after them after being mistaken as thugs. The four fail to retrieve the bag from the Andrews' mother once they fess up that they lied about being his friend. The Andrews' mother scolds them and doesn't give up the bag. Honai finds out where Maya lives and kidnaps her. Vijay, Appu and the gang are able to save her from Honai's grasp in a big fight scene near the end of the movie.

Pet Sematary Two
 Following the accidental death of his mother, thirteen-year-old Jeff Matthews and his veterinarian father, Chase, move to Ludlow, Maine. Ludlow had been his mother's hometown. He's introduced to the belligerent town sheriff, Gus Gilbert, and his stepson Drew whom Gus abuses relentlessly. Jeff also draws the ire of local bully Clyde Parker, who tells him about the story of the Creed family and the legend of the [[Mi'kmaq|Micmac]] burial ground.  One night, Gus shoots and kills Drew's beloved dog Zowie when he disturbs his pet rabbits. Drew asks Jeff to help him bury the dog in the Micmac burial ground to see if the rumors are true that it can resurrect the dead. Zowie does indeed return from the dead, but is uncharacteristically fierce. Chase treats Zowie for his gunshot wound, which refuses to heal; even more bizarre is the fact that Zowie has no heartbeat. Chase sends a sample of Zowie's blood to a lab. It turns out that Zowie's cells have completely deteriorated and are no different from those of a dead canine.  Jeff and Drew go to the pet sematery on Halloween for a night of horror stories with local boys. When Gus finds out that Drew's mother allowed him to go despite being grounded, he rushes to the cemetery and breaks up the party. He attacks his stepson, but just as he is about to hit him with a grave marker, Zowie appears. The dog fatally mauls Gus, whom the boys subsequently bury at the Indian cemetery. Gus returns to life; he now moves stiffly and rarely speaks, but treats Drew better. Over time Gus becomes increasingly crude and sadistic, sexually assaulting Drew's mother and brutally skinning the pet rabbits for supper.  Zowie breaks out of the veterinary clinic and kills three cats before entering Chase's home and attacking him. A day later, Jeff encounters Clyde – who is about to sever Jeff's nose using the wheel-spokes of his own bicycle when Gus shows up. He sends Jeff home, then murders Clyde as Drew looks on. Gus then pursues Drew to their house, where the boy is trapped with the savage Zowie. He escapes through a window just as his mother arrives home in her car, and the two take off. Gus pursues them at high speed in his police car, then kills them by ramming their car into an oncoming potato truck. Gus then returns to Clyde's body and puts it in a body bag, intending to take it to the burial ground as well.  After Drew's funeral, Jeff decides to reanimate his mother by using the Indian burial ground`s power. Gus exhumes her corpse, and brings it to Jeff at the burial ground. When Chase hears that his wife's grave has been robbed by Gus, he rushes to the Gilbert house. There he is attacked by Zowie and Gus, and he shoots and kills them both.  Upon coming back to life, Renee stabs and kills Marjorie Hargrove – the Matthews' housekeeper. Jeff confronts his undead mother in the attic, and they embrace. Chase arrives home and urges Jeff to get away from Renee, who says she wants to spend quality time with her husband. An undead Clyde arrives and, after knocking Chase out, tries to kill Jeff; first with an axe, and then with an ice-skate. Renee locks Chase and both boys in the attic, which she then sets on fire.  Jeff kills Clyde with a severed [[Live wire (electricity)|livewire]], then breaks down the attic door to escape. Renee wants Jeff to stay and join her in death, saying she loves him. But Jeff drags his father out of the house as Renee is destroyed by the flames while shrieking "Dead is better!". In the final scene, a recovering Chase locks up his veterinary clinic, then he and his son leave Ludlow behind.

His job is threatened when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy ([[Peter Gallagher]]) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death threat postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected.  Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane ([[Vincent D'Onofrio]]). Mill is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir ([[Greta Scacchi]]) that Kahane is at a theater in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. Mill pretends to recognize Kahane in the lobby, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar where Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mill's offer; he calls Mill a liar and continues goading him about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot, the two men fight. Mill goes too far and accidentally drowns Kahane in a shallow pool of water, then stages the crime to make it look like a botched robbery.  The next day, after Mill is late for and distracted at a meeting, Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel ([[Fred Ward]]) confronts him about the murder and says that the police know that he was the last one to see Kahane alive.

The Playboys
 In a small Irish village in 1957, Tara Maguire, a young resolute woman, is the talk of the town because she is having a baby out of wedlock, and refuses to name the father. During Sunday mass she goes into labour giving birth to a baby boy. Sergeant Brendan Hegarty, the local police officer of the [[Garda Síochána]], and Mick, a local landowner, vie for Tara's hand in marriage, but she refuses them both.  Mick loses his cattle and facing economical ruin commits suicide. People in town blame his death on Tara's rejection. The local priest, Father Malone, attempts to compel Tara to marry the constable before another tragedy takes place. But Tara is not in love with the solemn and older Sgt. Hegarty, a reformed alcoholic, who hides the fury of his unrequited love for Tara in his devotion for her. He carves a cradle for the baby, but Tara vehemently refuses the gift and his attentions.  The beautiful and strong willed Tara lives with her sister Brigid and is determined to make it on her own. She supplements her income as a dressmaker, raising chickens in her garden and smuggling goods from the nearby border with [[Northern Ireland]]. However even in this she has to face Hegarty who discovers her secret illegal dealings while riding his bicycle at night looking for smugglers on the roads.  The arrival of a shabby troupe of travelling actors called the "Playboys", stirs the town. Tara surprises Tom, one of the actors, stealing one of her chickens. He has to pay for it, but he is smitten with her beauty and her character. They flirt and spar around the village, all under the resentful eye of the constable. The Playboys are a success in the sleepy village and the tent is full when the show starts at night. One of their numbers with female dancers lifting their skirts causes a furious response from Father Malone, who has another opinion of what is wholesome entertainment. The actors are forced to switch to staging ''[[Othello]]''.  A blind woman gets so excited during a show that she suddenly regains her vision. Not only do the group of actors have to deal with discord when the time to share the dividends comes, but the recent arrival of television threatens the survival of their art.  The romance between Tara and Tom grows slowly over the few days the theatrical company is in the village. Her past has made her suspicious of men, and Hegarty's intrusions provide an added obstacle. He tells her that Tom is a liar who already has a wife, which turn out not to be true. Hegarty confronts Tom and tells him that he is the father of the baby, but Tara assures him that not only she does not have any feelings for the constable but that the baby was conceived on a lonely night without deep feeling involved on her part.  One of the actors is involved with the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and has smuggled some explosives.  When the explosives are accidentally discovered by Hegarty he blames his rival. Tom is framed as an IRA man, but he breaks out of jail with Tara's help. When ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'' plays at the local cinema, the actors stage an instant, improvised knock-off of it, with Atlanta burning while Tom struggles with his lines in the role of [[Rhett Butler]]. Comically, Fred ([[Milo O'Shea]]) has to take the role of Mammy. During the show the triangle between Tara, Tom and Sergeant Hegarty comes to a boiling point. The performance is interrupted by the frantic Brigid. Hegarty, drunk, has taken the baby. He comes to the tent, drunk, but gives the baby back to Tara.  There is a confrontation between Tom and the Sergeant, but the Sergeant painfully loses in a public fist fight with Tom.  Even after this defeat, he trashes the tent. The next day the time for the playboys to leave has come. Hegarty, now jobless and in civilian clothes, also leaves the town for good. Tom is happily surprised when Tara decides to join the group with her baby and share a life together, perhaps in the end to take on a new life with Tom in America.

Poison Ivy (1992 film)
 Sylvie Cooper is a teenage girl at a private school for the wealthy. At a local hangout, she first meets Ivy, a [[Know-how|street-smart]] but poor, and trashy girl, and witnesses Ivy mercy-killing a heavily wounded dog.  In their second meeting, when Sylvie's father Darrel comes to pick her up, Ivy asks for a ride, and Darrel reluctantly agrees. Ivy makes an excuse to sit in the front with Darrel. She puts her feet on the dashboard and deliberately allows her mini-skirt to fall back onto her hip, revealing her legs, which Darrel notices.  A few weeks later, Sylvie invites Ivy to her house. She tells Ivy that Darrel is her adoptive father and that her biological father is African-American. She also says that she once tried to kill herself. They meet Sylvie's sickly mother, Georgie, whom Ivy later wins over by talking about her scholarship and helping her unblock her oxygen tank.  Soon after, as both of Sylvie's parents enjoy Ivy's company, they practically allow Ivy to move in. Ivy and Sylvie share clothes and sleep in the same bed. As they have similar figures, Georgie lends Ivy some of her clothes.  In an attempt to improve his failing career, Darrel decides to throw a party at his house, and enlists Sylvie to help him. However, Sylvie is needed at work on the night of the party, which is orchestrated by Ivy, so that Ivy will be the one to assist Darrel with the party. After the party, she dances with Darrel in the kitchen and they hug. Georgie walks in on them and storms upstairs. Ivy apologizes to Georgie and claims that Darrel was under stress and she was only comforting him. Georgie believes Ivy, accepts a glass of champagne drugged with sleeping pills, and falls asleep. Ivy sits on the bed next to Georgie and begins to massage Darrel with her foot while he kisses her legs.  Over the next few days, Ivy continues changing her appearance and wears Georgie's clothing more often. Sylvie becomes increasingly irritated with Ivy for her growing presence in her family, and her anger reaches a breaking point when even her dog chooses Ivy over her, which in fact, was because Ivy has some dog treats in her pockets. Sylvie skips school and tries to spend some time alone. Darrel picks Ivy up and they go into the forest, where Ivy gets Darrel drunk and has sex with him.  The next morning, Georgie plays a cassette tape that Sylvie made for her and walks out onto her balcony. Ivy walks up behind Georgie, talks to her and without warning, pushes her off the balcony to her death. Because Georgie is known to have a mental illness, and has threatened to commit suicide previously, Ivy is not suspected. A few weeks later, Sylvie talks Ivy into going for a ride in her mother's sports car. When Sylvie becomes suspicious of her involvement in Georgie's death, Ivy crashes the car, then moves the unconscious Sylvie into the driver's seat.  In the hospital, Sylvie hallucinates that her mother is sitting in front of her. This inspires her to get back to her house in an attempt to save her father from Ivy. When she gets to her house there is a raging storm. She runs inside to get out of the rain, experiencing hallucinations all along the way. When she gets inside, she sees Darrel and Ivy having sex and flees the room.  As Darrel runs outside to look for Sylvie, Ivy runs out after him, accidentally revealing that she was behind the wheel due to scaring on her chest. She lies claiming that it was to protect him. He drives off to find Sylvie and Ivy goes up to Georgie's old room, plays the tape Sylvie made for Georgie, wears Georgie's robe and walks out the balcony. Sylvie sees Ivy and, because of her head injury, believes that it is her mother, and makes her way to the balcony. Sylvie tells Georgie that she loves her and Georgie says she loves Sylvie too. When they kiss, Ivy begins to use her tongue, which breaks Sylvie out of her hallucination. Ivy says Georgie wanted to die and now the three of them can be a family. Sylvie pushes Ivy over the balcony, but Ivy holds onto Sylvie's necklace. The chain breaks and Ivy falls to her death. Darrell returns to see Ivy on the ground with Sylvie above.   The film ends with Sylvie narrating that she still loves and misses "her", following the parallel between Ivy and Georgie.

The action then shifts to [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], where Chaibat's wife, Chen Wen-Shi, is in prison, facing the [[Capital_punishment_in_Malaysia|death penalty]] for an unspecified crime. Chaibat needs to get her out of prison, because only she knows the secret codes to his [[Banking in Switzerland|Swiss bank account]], and will not reveal them to him unless freed. Chaibat brings his gang, now including Ka-Kui and Yang, to Kuala Lumpur to stage a jailbreak.  A new difficulty arises when Ka-Kui sees his girlfriend May, a tour guide, in Kuala Lumpur leading a party of Hong Kong tourists. He has told her he's on assignment. Ka-Kui evades May at first, but she sees him at the luxurious hotel where Chaibat's gang are staying, with the beautiful Yang, and confronts him in a jealous rage. This nearly blows Ka-Kui's cover, but Panther is persuaded that May is angry because Ka-Kui tried to proposition her as a prostitute. Later, Ka-Kui gets May alone and explains the situation, and she finally calms down. At one point, May even manages to keep Ka-Kui from inadvertently blowing his own cover. But then, in an elevator, May tells a co-worker about Ka-Kui, and is overheard by one of Panther's men. Chaibat takes May hostage, and forces Ka-Kui and Yang – their cover now blown – to help free Chen.  Chaibat's scheme is successful and May is released, as per their agreement. However, the exchange turns sour when Chaibat pushes May from his helicopter, though she survives. Furious, Ka-Kui and Yang pursue Chaibat and his men over the roads, rooftops (where Ka-Kui and Yang defeat Panther and his partner), and skies of Kuala Lumpur. In the climax on top of a speeding train, Chaibat is killed after his helicopter collides with a bridge and lands on him. Yang and Ka-Kui also recapture Chen. Since her husband is dead, she decides to tell Yang and Ka-Kui the password to Chaibat's bank account. The two partners argue whether Hong Kong or China will get the money.  
Police Officer (film)
   
The Pocket-knife
 The story is about a 6-year-old boy who tries to return his friend's penknife, but faces difficulties because his friend has moved to another town. He has to keep his quest a secret because he is forbidden to carry a knife. Eventually he enters a talent contest, hoping to get a message to his friend through a song.  
Porco Rosso
 Porco Rosso, a veteran [[World War I]] fighter ace and freelance [[bounty hunter]], fends off an attack on a ferry liner by [[airborne pirates]]. Porco treats himself to dinner at the Hotel Adriano, which is run by his friend Gina.  At the hotel, the heads of the pirate gangs are contracting Curtis, an arrogant and ambitious American ace, to assist them in their next attacks. Curtis falls in love with Gina on the spot, but is frustrated to see his declarations rebuffed and her affection for Porco. After successfully executing a pirating mission, Curtis tracks down Porco, who is flying to [[Turin]] to have his plane serviced, and shoots him down as he experiences an engine outage, claiming to have killed him. Porco survives, though his plane is heavily damaged. Porco continues the trip by train with the remains of the plane, much to the irritation of Gina, who reminds him that there is a warrant for his arrest in [[Italy]].  Porco arrives discreetly in Turin to meet Piccolo, his [[mechanic]]. He learns that Piccolo's sons have emigrated to find work elsewhere due to the [[great depression]], and much of the engineering will have to be carried on by his young granddaughter Fio. Porco is initially skeptical of Fio's abilities as a mechanic, but after seeing her dedication in the repair project he accepts her as a competent engineer. Once Porco's plane is finished, Fio joins him on his flight home, with the justification that if the [[OVRA|secret police]] arrest the team, they can say that Porco forced them to help and took Fio as a hostage. Stopping off to refuel on the way, Porco discovers that [[National Fascist Party|the new fascist government]] is beginning to hire seaplane pirates for their own use, thus putting him out of business.  Back at the Hotel Adriano, Curtis proposes to Gina but she turns him down, saying that she is waiting for Porco Rosso. Upon returning home, Porco and Fio are ambushed by the pirates, who threaten to kill Porco and destroy his plane. Fio talks them out of it, but Curtis appears and challenges Porco to a final duel. Fio makes a deal with him declaring that if Porco wins, Curtis must pay off his debts owed to Piccolo's company, and if Curtis wins, he may marry her.  That night, Porco tells a story from World War I. His entire squadron apart from himself was shot down in a dogfight with [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] aircraft. He recalls blacking out and awakening to find himself in complete stillness, with a white band hovering in the distant sky. Allied and enemy aircraft, flown by the airmen who died in the dogfight, fly past towards the band but ignore him. Porco soon sees that the band is in fact thousands of planes flying together. He blacks out again, and when he awakes he discovers that he has been turned into a pig. He believes this to be a divine punishment for fleeing from the fight.{{#tag:ref|This aspect of the story has parallels to [[Roald Dahl]]'s short story ''[[They Shall Not Grow Old]]''.<ref>{{cite web  |url = http://www.roalddahlfans.com/shortstories/they.php  |title = Short Stories: "They Shall Not Grow Old"  |work = RoaldDahlFans.com  |accessdate = 28 May 2012  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web  |title=Porco Rosso  |url=http://www.barbican.org.uk/artgallery/event-detail.asp?ID=12384  |publisher=Barbican Centre  }}</ref> |group=note}}  The next day, the duel is arranged and a large crowd gathers to observe. The indecisive dogfight between Porco and Curtis soon dissolves into a [[bare-knuckle boxing]] match. Gina appears and warns the crowd that the Italian air force has been alerted and are on their way. Porco barely wins the fight upon her arrival, and hands Fio over to Gina, requesting that she look after Fio. Before the plane takes off, Fio gives Porco a kiss. With the crowd gone, Porco and Curtis agree to delay the air force together. When Curtis sees Porco's face, he reacts with surprise. Fio narrates that in the end Porco outflies the Italian air force and is never hunted by them again; Fio herself became president of the Piccolo company, which is now an aircraft manufacturer; Curtis became a famous actor; and the pirates continued to attend the Hotel Adriano in their old age. She does not divulge whether Gina's hope about Porco Rosso was ever realized.  After the credits, a familiar red seaplane appears soaring in the sky before disappearing into the clouds.  
The Power of One (film)
 Born in 1930 to a recently widowed Englishwoman on a homestead in rural [[Natal Province|Natal]], little Peter Philip ([[Guy Witcher]]) is schooled in the ways of England by his mother and the ways of Africa by a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] nanny ([[Nomadlozi Kubheka]]), whose son Tonderai is also his best friend. Their easy life is forever shattered, however, when the farm's cattle are claimed by ''[[rinderpest]]''. PK's mother succumbs to a nervous breakdown, and he is sent away to a conservative [[Afrikaans]] boarding school while she recovers.  Being the only English student at the boarding school, PK soon earns almost universal contempt from his scathing [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]] fellows—particularly an older student, Jaapie Botha. Botha's abuse and his inferiority complex strikes PK with a severe case of [[nocturnal enuresis]], a habit which he eventually overcomes with local [[Traditional healers of South Africa|sangoma]] Dabula Manzi. In conquering his nightmares, PK is given a chicken (''Mother Courage''), which becomes his closest companion. Botha subsequently captures PK and Mother Courage and has them tried before a mock court while elaborating on the depth of his hatred for the British&mdash;a people he holds responsible for atrocities committed during the [[Second Boer War]]. The Afrikaans boys hang Mother Courage and kill her with a rock. When PK physically retaliates against Botha, they attempt to execute him in a similar manner but are interrupted by a teacher who later oversees Botha's expulsion.  With his mother dying, PK finds himself living with his grandfather in [[Barberton, Mpumalanga|Barberton]]. He eventually seeks a mentor in Karl "Doc" von Vollensteen ([[Armin Mueller-Stahl]]), a lonely [[Germans|German]] musician who lost his family in Europe. Doc warms to PK and under his guidance the latter soon becomes an excellent pianist. He is interned as an enemy alien at the onset of [[World War II]], but PK continues to visit him regularly in prison. Doc introduces the boy to Geel Piet ([[Morgan Freeman]]), a [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] inmate who takes von Vollensteen's place as PK's mentor, training him to be an excellent boxer. Piet also impresses on PK his [[mantra]]: "first with the head, then with the heart", a phrase that will see the young man through even greater hard times ahead.  A maturing PK ([[Simon Fenton]]) begins to express sympathy towards black prisoners, who are detained under appalling conditions. He works with Doc to distribute contraband among the Africans, writing their letters to home, and sharing their many sufferings. The war does not end happily for PK, as Doc is repatriated and Piet&mdash;seriously injured by a white warder&mdash;fails to survive his sentence. PK is sent away again, this time to study at the prestigious Prince of Wales School in [[Johannesburg]]. While attending a boxing championship, he is enamoured by Maria Marais, daughter of a leading [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] official. Since her strict father will not permit them to see each other openly, they begin dating in secret. On one such outing they are introduced to Gideon Duma, a prominent boxer in [[Alexandra, Gauteng|Alexandra]], a notorious black township. Duma's passion for resisting [[apartheid]] inspires PK, and he begins teaching English at a rural African school.  Maria's father, incensed by the couple's ongoing relationship and PK's ties to a multiracial gym, leads him to request a formal investigation by one of his [[South African Police]] contacts, Colonel Breyten. Breyten and his sergeant, an embittered Jaapie Botha, place PK under surveillance for subversion. His clashes with the SAP finally come to a head when Maria is killed during a raid on a biracial church by the security forces. Maddened by grief, PK considers fleeing to England, but is consoled by his former boxing partner, who reminds him of all the good he can still do in Africa.  Botha leads a violent raid on Alexandra the following night. He threatens to shoot Elias Mlungisi, the local boxing promoter, only to be confronted by PK. They spar; PK easily bests his childhood enemy. Botha is still bent on executing the erstwhile victor, but an arriving Gideon Duma dispatches the policeman with a cricket bat before he can fire and fractures his skull. Now fugitives from the apartheid government, PK and Duma vow to continue a campaign against racial injustice. Peter's closing narration identifies meaningful voices during his life; from mother and nanny, to Doc and Dabula Manzi, Geel Piet and, finally, Maria Marais.

The next day, Irene goes exploring in the castle after discovering a magical secret door in her bedroom.

The same day, Curdie and his father are underground in the mines, and Curdie falls through a pothole and into the realm of the goblins. Hidden, he follows the goblins to a vast cavern where the sniveling Goblin King and the malevolent Goblin Queen are holding an audience, announcing their scheme to flood the mines and drown the "Sun People"... humans. Suddenly, Prince Froglip, the feared, yet spoiled and infantile, heir to the goblin throne, announces drowning them is "Not enough!" and states he shall abduct the Princess of the Sun People and marry her, thereby forcing the humans to accept the goblins as their rulers. He claims that this is revenge for the humans exiling the goblins underground centuries beforehand. Before Curdie can run and tell the others, the goblins find him and put him away in a dungeon. Luckily, Irene and Turnip have snuck out of the castle again, following a magic thread given to her by her grandmother, invisible to everyone else. The thread leads Irene to Curdie and working together, Curdie is released from his improvised cell.  The two children are chased by the goblins but luckily escape. The miners are warned of the flooding plan in time to begin erecting supports to keep most of the tunnels free of water and the castle is also put on guard. The goblins do attack and Curdie must show all the castle people how to fight - namely, to jump on the goblins' feet and sing. Curdie also realizes if the miners are successful, the water will have nowhere to go but up and will end up flooding the castle.  He tries to get everyone to leave and he and the king realize Irene is missing. Curdie finds Irene being held captive by the evil Froglip.

Prom Night IV: Deliver Us from Evil
 At Hamilton High School's 1957 prom, students Lisa and Brad leave the festivities to have sex in Brad's car. Before the two can undress, they are distracted by a noise, revealed to be someone putting candles on the hood of the car. After spotting the candles, Lisa has her throat slashed by a metal crucifix, wielded by psychotic religious fanatic, Father Jonas; he then stabs Brad in the chest before igniting the car in flames. After committing this double homicide, Father Jonas reveals he had suffered [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|sexual abuse from priests]] in the church, and displays [[stigmata]]. He is transported from St. Basil Seminary to the St. George Church by a group of fellow priests led by Father Jaeger, who refers to the rambling Father Jonas as an abomination and believes him possessed by dark forces.  In 1991 at St. George Church, young Father Colin is informed by the now-elderly Father Jaeger that his trip to [[Africa]] for missionary work has been put off and that he has been ordered by the church with watching over Father Jonas, who has been held captive in the church basement for thirty-three years in a drug-induced stupor; shortly after showing Colin the catatonic Jonas, Jaeger passes away, officially leaving Colin as Jonas’s new guardian. Believing he can help Jonas, Colin neglects drugging him, an act which allows Jonas to regain consciousness. Father Jonas escapes, killing Colin before fleeing to St. Basil Seminary. Discovering Colin's death and Jonas's escape, Cardinal Tourette stages Colin's murder to appear as a suicide before going off in search of Jonas.  At the St. Basil Seminary, which has long since been abandoned and converted into a summer home, two young couples - consisting of the summer home owner's son Mark, his girlfriend Meagan, the mischievous Laura and her boyfriend Jeff - arrive planning to celebrate their graduation privately instead of going to prom, but find most of the electronics and appliances in the house have been stolen. Deciding to stay party anyway, the group is stalked by Jonas, who acquires his old metal crucifix and uses it to kill Mark's younger brother Jonathan, who had followed the group to the house.  After injuring herself in the wine cellar, Meagan receives an obscene phone call from Jonas while Mark is away getting the first aid kit to tend to her wounds. After calling Meagan, Jonas enters the house through his old lair and kills Laura, subsequently moving her body. While looking for the missing Laura, Mark and Meagan find Jonas's lair, while Jeff searches the attic. Finding what looks like Laura, Jeff approaches the figure, only to find it is Jonas wearing Laura’s scalp; Jonas proceeds to kill Jeff by crushing the boy's skull with his bare hands.  Going outside to look around, Mark and Meagan rush back inside where they find Laura and Jeff's bodies crucified and ablaze. As Meagan tries to call the police Mark arms himself with a gun and has Meagan flee outside when Jonas appears. Rushing to the roof of the house, Mark is stabbed in the foot through the roof by Jonas, causing him to fall to the ground below. Jonas stabs mark to death with his crucifix, and then pursues Meagan, who temporarily manages to incapacitate him by spraying him in the face with bug spray. Outside, Meagan arms herself with a gun Mark had dropped, gets bullets from inside and, after being phoned by the police (a call which is interrupted by Jonas) goes to the wood shed. After missing several times, Meagan manages to shoot Jonas and, believing him dead, begins praying for forgiveness, only to be attacked mid-prayer by the still living Jonas, who begins setting the barn on fire using an aspergillum that emits flames instead of holy water. Grabbing a shovel, Meagan beats Jonas with it and rushes outside and locks the door, leaving Jonas to burn and subsequently be blown up when the shed explodes.  In the morning Meagan is loaded into an ambulance, while the charred and seemingly dead Jonas is placed in another, which is manned by Cardinal Tourette and his followers. While in the back of the ambulance, Jonas opens his eyes, while elsewhere Meagan does the same simultaneously.

Pushing Hands (film)
 The story is about an elderly Chinese [[Taiji Quan]] teacher and grandfather who emigrates from [[Beijing]] to live with his son, American daughter-in-law, and grandson in a [[New York City]] suburb. The grandfather is increasingly distanced from the family as a "fish out of water" in [[Western culture]]. The film shows the contrast between traditional Chinese ideas of [[Confucian]] relationships within a family and the much more informal Western emphasis on the individual. The friction in the family caused by these differing expectations eventually leads to the grandfather moving out of the family home (something very alien to traditional expectations), and in the process he learns lessons (some comical, some poignant) about how he must adapt to his new surroundings before he comes to terms with his new life.

Bunty finds another cat which bears an uncanny resemblance to the dead cat. The family gets its first shock. Another day, Mini and Deepak decide to enjoy a ride to the city limits. While returning home, Deepak's bike rear tire goes flat. Deepak rides with a passerby to get a spare tire from a village nearby and asks Mini to wait for him. On returning, Deepak finds Mini sitting beside a tree near a pond, clutching her face and apparently weeping. Approaching her, Deepak stares at her fierce, reddening eyes (resembling the dead cat eyes), and slips into the pond. All of a sudden, Mini turns normal and calls to Deepak to come out of the pond.   The next day, Mini attends her classmate Rashmi's friend's marriage accompanying her. Rashmi is brutally killed on that day, her neck broken and head turned all the way back. The police officer investigating the case notices that during interrogation, Mini twists her doll's head exactly the way Rashmi's neck was twisted. The police investigating officer who visits Mini's home for questioning meets with an accident while riding out and dies. These events lead Mini's parents to seek professional help. Shalini approaches their neighbor, the old lady, while Mr. Sharma takes the help of a psychiatrist ([[Ananth Nag]]) regarding as nonsense the occult thoughts that his wife believes is the reason for their daughter's horror-stricken behavior. The neighbor old lady advises Shalini to seek the services of Sharji ([[Om Puri]]), who lives in Falaknuma. Sharji first visits his "guru" (Vijayachander) who has taken samadhi in the remote Falaknuma and gets fire-power ashes as a weapon. Sharji then locates the ghost ([[Sunanda]]) in Mini's house basement under the floor and finds it to be that of the woman who was the previous owner's moll and who was murdered brutally. Later, while the killer is abed with his new paramour, the ghost of his former moll kills him, as her hands and arms emerge from the bed and twist his neck, much like Rashmi's was done.   Following horrific events involving the ghost trying to kill Deepak, Sharji finally neutralizes her with the help of holy chants and the ashes. The ghost finally leaves Mini's body with a thundering flash.  On the one hand, scientific methods involving MRI and other medical procedures are conducted on Mini. This Mr. Sharma believes is the only way Mini could be "cured". However, Sharji has his own explanation of darkness beyond the light, that doesn't vanish, but is only diminished to an extent.   RGV has spun the web of horror played with confusion, dilemma, and the plight of the affected persons to the greatest extent possible, as required of a horror movie.

Nix Sr. (Lithgow) is in fact alive, having faked his own death to elude prosecution for attempting to buy babies. He has established a new identity and a clandestine research facility in [[Norway]]. He has been using Carter and his multiples to procure the children so he will have an adequate [[control group]] to study the development of MPD. Jenny follows who she thinks is Waldheim to a motel, but it is actually Carter/Cain. She follows Carter/Cain, who is now Margo, into an elevator. When it opens, she sees Nix Sr. with her daughter Amy. While Jenny begs for Nix Sr. to give back her daughter, Carter, Cain and Margo stabs "their" father from behind. Jack arrives with the police, and Carter and his personalities disappear.  The movie ends with Jenny and Amy in a park. Amy runs off into the woods calling "Daddy, Daddy".

Revenge of the Nerds III: The Next Generation
 A new generation of [[nerd]] students now rule on campus at early-90's Adams College. The Alpha Betas are respectful of the nerds' prominence, some even wishing their [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] could have a better academic record. Everything changes when a successful but reprehensible businessman, Orrin Price ([[Morton Downey, Jr.]]), becomes a member of the Adams College Board of Regents. A new generation of [[Jock (subculture)|jock]]s has also just come to Adams, including Orrin's nerd-hating son. Former Alpha Beta Stan Gable, now a [[motorcycle]] police officer, is installed as the new Dean of Students by Orrin Price.   Lewis, who chairs Adams' Computer Science Department, has been distancing himself from his nerd past by growing a [[ponytail]] and asking people to call him "Lew" rather than Lewis. His nephew Harold, now a student at Adams, is surprised at his uncle's behavior, pointing out that in his day Lewis was the "[[George Washington]] of nerds". Betty, now married to Lewis and also an art professor at Adams College, tries to remind him that she fell in love with him because he had the courage to be himself. But Lewis is more interested in becoming friends with the new dean, not noticing that Stan Gable hopes to break up his marriage and win back Betty. Meanwhile, Harold and his friend pledge Lambda Lambda Lambda, whose group now includes an [[obese]] kilt-wearing English inductee and a [[Koreans|Korean]] [[Elvis impersonator]], who emphasizes that he is ''South'' Korean when asked about his [[dixie]] accent. Harold successfully makes it through the Tri-Lam's "rush week". However, a barbeque celebrating the new members is disrupted by Alpha Betas in ski masks. More harassment comes, and the Tri-Lambs look for legal help, but have a hard time finding a suitable alumni due to most of them getting technical jobs. However, one alumni is an attorney, Dudley "Booger" Dawson. Booger warns Lewis about the harassment, but leaves in disgust when he sees Betty and Lewis socializing with Stan, calling Lewis a "self hater".   Lewis reaches out to Stan to help defend the Tri-Lambs, but Stan says no. Lewis angrily reminds Stan that he was forgiving of their rocky past and even defended him when others were telling him Stan was worthless. But Stan says that he is not Lewis' friend and that Lewis will always be a nerd. This betrayal finally spurs Lewis to once again embrace his nerd self. He arranges [[bail]] for the arrested Tri-Lambs by putting up his house as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. He then calls upon all nerds, those on campus and in the city, who are sympathetic to their cause to participate in a massive nerd strike. Many of the city's basic utilities and services become crippled. To end the strike, Price decides to frame Lewis for embezzling college funds and harvesting [[marijuana]] in the basement of the Tri-Lamb house. Stan thinks Orrin Price has gone too far, and remembering his law enforcement past, cannot fathom robbery and illegal drugs, yet does not object to Price's actions. The strike is called off after Lewis is arrested. Betty then confronts Stan about getting Lewis released, even offering herself to him. Stan becomes deeply ashamed and declines her offer, saying "he still has a little pride left".  Many of Lewis' old Tri-Lamb friends as well as his father have returned to support him, despite Lewis believing they would never forgive him for denying his nerd self. When the trial begins, things look bad for Lewis; the judge denies all of Booger's arguments and says that Lewis is guilty. After introspection, Stan has a change of heart and testifies against Price, admitting that he has proof that Price framed Lewis for the theft and also planted the marijuana. Stan also admits that he is a nerd and has always wanted to read books and learn as much as possible, but his family always discouraged it. Price is arrested, and the charges against Lewis are dismissed. The Tri-Lambs are cleared, and the Alpha Betas are defeated once again, this time losing their Adams fraternity charter. Stan feels it best that he resign as Dean of Students, but Lewis convincingly argues Stan to stay on. The nerds accept Stan as one of their own, once again guaranteeing nerd freedom at Adams College.

As the fight continues, Tarzan, leader of the East Cell, arrives announcing his intent to fight Ricky but leaves along with the Gang as the Zero Alarm goes off.  The next day, the Warden and his spoiled son return from their vacation. Dan informs the Warden about the incidents, including the poppy garden. This infuriates the Warden, almost transforming into a [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] like creature, though he prevents it by taking medication. As the Warden questions Ricky, Tarzan bursts through the wall to fight Ricky, which ends in Ricky dismembering half of Tarzan's left arm and breaking his [[mandible]]. The Warden activates a ceiling trap on Ricky who struggles to stay alive. Tarzan regains consciousness and holds the ceiling, only to unintentionally save Ricky by being crushed himself. After escaping, Ricky finds a photo showing Tarzan had a family waiting for him. The Warden orders the inmates bury Ricky alive, which they reluctantly obey. The Warden proposes if Ricky survives staying underground for a week, he will free him. Ricky does survive by eating dog meat, however the Warden denies him freedom. Later that night, Ricky is brought food by an inmate Freddy. Another inmate informs Dan who mortally wounds Freddy. Dan then opens Ricky's cell to taunt him. However, Ricky breaks free and kills the inmate who told, and knocks out Dan's remaining eye. The inmates then rebel and violently ambush Dan.  In the kitchen, Ricky, the prisoners, and Dan burst through the wall. The Warden shoots Dan with a homemade gas-pressured bullet, causing him to inflate and violently explode. Rogan and Brandon confront Ricky, who gravely injures Rogan. Brandon, realizing Ricky is far too powerful for him, flees from the scene, but not before the Warden shoots and kills Brandon. The Warden, revealing that he too, is a martial artist, transforms into a grotesque creature and battles Ricky. The fight ends with Ricky crippling and throwing the mutated Warden into a meat grinder. The prisoners rebel once again and start to attack the guards until Ricky reaches the prison wall, breaking it allowing the prisoners and himself to go free.

Roja
 In [[Srinagar]], a [[Hizbul Mujahideen|Kashmiri terrorist]], Wasim Khan, is captured by a team led by Colonel Rayappa. In South India, 18-year old Roja is a simple village girl born and brought up in [[Sundarapandiapuram]] in [[Tirunelveli]] district in southern [[Tamil Nadu]]. Roja fervently wishes that her sister Shenbagam's marriage proposal with Rishi Kumar, a [[Cryptography|cryptologist]] working with the [[Research and Analysis Wing|R.A.W.]] of India, goes smoothly. Unknown to her and her family, Shenbagam is in love with the son of her paternal aunt.  When Rishi wishes to speak to Shenbagam alone, she gathers enough courage to convey this and politely asks him to reject her in front of her parents, to which he obliges. To everyone’s surprise Rishi requests Roja's hand in marriage instead. Being unaware of Shenbagam's love affair, Roja is not willing to accept Rishi's proposal as she believes that he is the best match for Shenbagam but she marries Rishi, and the couple go to live in [[Chennai|Madras]] while Shenbagam marries her cousin.  Initially Roja does not like what Rishi did, but when she learns of Shenbagam's love affair and consequent rejection of Rishi, she apologises and starts seeing him in a new light. Love blossoms, and life is blissful for the couple for a short while. Meanwhile, due to the illness of his Chief, Rishi is assigned to an army communications centre in [[Baramulla]] to intercept military intelligence. The couple find themselves in a beautiful yet alien land. Roja's world turns upside down when Rishi is abducted by terrorists whose agenda is to separate [[Kashmir]] from India and free their leader, Wasim Khan, from judicial custody.  Faced with the daunting task of rescuing her husband, Roja runs from pillar to post, pleading with politicians and the military for help. Further complicating matters is the communication gap: She can't speak their language, and they can't speak hers. Meanwhile, Rishi, held captive by a group of terrorists led by Liaqat, an  associate to Wasim Khan, tries to reason with the terrorists, about their misdirected motive for the liberation of Kashmir. Liaqat's sister shows a little compassion towards him. Initially, when Roja’s efforts fail, the Indian government denies any negotiations with the terrorists for the release of Rishi in the media.  The angered terrorists attempt to burn an Indian flag. Rishi risks his life to put out the fire and shows the terrorist how much the country means to him, a regular citizen. When Liaqat’s younger brother, who with a few other youths from his village was sent across the border to [[Pakistan]] for training, is shot by the Pakistan Army, Liaqat’s strong belief is shaken, but he still manages to convince himself of the cause. Consequently, Roja’s efforts to apprise the politicians of her suffering and pain are successful as a minister pities her and offers to help.  Much to the chagrin of Rayappa, the government decides to release Wasim Khan in exchange for Rishi. Rishi, not wanting to be used as a pawn to release a dangerous terrorist, gets help from the sympathetic Liaqat’s sister and escapes&nbsp;— with Liaqat and his men chasing him. Rayappa, Roja and other army officers get to the hostage exchange spot with Wasim Khan, but Liaqat does not show up.  The Army locks Wasim Khan up in the prison.  Rishi has managed to get close to the exchange spot on his own after evading the terrorists. During his escape, Rishi kills two terrorists. Liaqat catches up with him and holds him at gun point. Rishi reasons with Liaqat further and convinces him that his war is immoral. Liaqat lets Rishi go and he goes to the exchange spot. Liaqat escapes from the Indian Army. Rishi and Roja are united once again.

Norman and Paul are home taught and must adhere to the strict moral and educational code of their father.

Paul has become a reporter at a newspaper in [[Helena, Montana|Helena]].

Paul is arrested after fighting a man who has insulted her, and Norman is awakened in the middle of the night by a phone call from the police to come and bail Paul out of jail.  After Norman and Jessie go on several dates, she asks that Norman make an effort to get along with her brother Neal, who is visiting from California. Norman and Paul do not like Neal, but at Jessie's insistence they invite him to go fishing. Neal shows up drunk with a woman he met at a bar the night before. Norman and Paul decide to fish anyway and return to their car hours later to find that Neal and the woman have drunk all the beer and passed out naked in the sun.   Norman returns a painfully sunburned Neal home, where Jessie is waiting for them. She is angry that the brothers did not fish with Neal. Norman asks Jessie to drive him home, as he had brought Neal back in Neal's car, and he tells her that he is falling for her. She drives away angry but a week later asks Norman to come to the train station to see Neal off. After the train departs, Norman shows Jessie a letter from the [[University of Chicago]]: a job offer for an English Literature teaching position. Norman asks Jessie to marry him.  When Norman tells Paul about the job offer and marriage proposal, he urges Paul to come with him and Jessie to Chicago. Paul says that he will never leave Montana. Just before leaving for Chicago, Norman, Paul, and their father go fly fishing one last time. Paul catches a huge fish that drags him down the river through a set of rapids before he finally lands it. John proudly tells him what a wonderful fisherman he has become, and how he is an artist in the craft, much to Paul's delight. They pose for pictures with the huge fish.  Soon after the fishing excursion, Norman is called by the police, who tell him that Paul has been found beaten to death in an alley. Norman goes home and tells his parents the news. Years later, Mrs. Maclean, Norman, Jessie, and their two children listen to a sermon being given by John, who dies soon after. Norman is now an old man, back in the Montana river where he used to fish with his family many years before. He says that nearly everyone from his youth is dead, including Jessie, and that he is haunted by waters.

Ruby (1992 film)
  The film begins with Jack Ruby saying, "Lookin' back at it now, what can you say? It feels like it was a dream. Yeah, that's it, a dream. Maybe none of it never happened. Because when I look back on it today, this is the best sense I can make of it." Then the scene shows a murder; a corpse, dressed in a suit, is being drained of blood, having been hung on a meat hook. It is readily apparent that the corpse has been tortured, and it is implied that the presentation of the body is intended to be a brutal message.  The next scene switches location to the Carousel Club of [[Dallas]], Texas in 1962, a burlesque club owned by Jack Ruby. It is a slow night at the club, with only a sparse audience for the featured performer, and few bar patrons. The featured dancer, named Telephone Trixie, is unprepared for the show, unenthusiastic, and well beyond her glory days. Ruby regretfully watches her lackluster performance and ruefully observes the disappointing state of his business. Near closing, Ruby leaves the Carousel through a rear/side exit in order to make a rendezvous with two corrupt officers from the Dallas Police Department in order to supply them with narcotics. The next scene shows an attractive young blond woman sitting in front of a mirror applying make-up to a facial bruise; the scene strongly suggests that her sleeping husband or significant other has been abusing her.  The next set of scenes follows Ruby as he closes the Carousel Club and makes a stop at an all-night diner which is adjacent to a bus station. Inside the diner, Ruby observes the young blond from the previous scene and stops to speak with her and offer a meal and a place to stay. In the course of discussion between the young woman and Ruby, it is made clear that Jack is not making a sexual advance, and is instead offering lodging in a gesture of platonic friendship. Destitute, desperate, and homeless, the young Sheryl Ann DuJean then accompanies Ruby back to Carousel Club where Ruby gives her lodging in an apartment in the area above the club.  The next day, Ruby has a conversation on the state of Carousel with his bartender, who is established to be a young Cuban exile named Diego. Ruby's troubles are further amplified by the appearance cancellation of the next featured dancer who was scheduled to appear on stage. Having heard Ruby's conversation about the cancellation, Sheryl Ann offers to perform for Ruby during his police appreciation show that night. Ruby, reluctant to believe that the innocent and demure Sheryl Ann is stripper material, is desperate and left with no other choice than to allow her to dance. Sheryl Ann adopts the stage name Candy Cane and then takes the stage only to wow the law enforcement crowd with her skilled and enthusiastic performance. Even the jaded Jack Ruby is surprised by her expertise, and realizes she is experienced as a stripper. The crowd reacts enthusiastically, and things begin to look up for Jack Ruby as he has a showstopper as a featured dancer, and a chance at revitalizing his business. Ruby and Candy Cane come to understanding that they be truthful, and a friendship develops between the two.  Shortly after the upswing in business, Jack is contacted by one of his former mob associates, named Louie Vitali, about performing a [[black bag job]] in Cuba which the murder victim, Action Jackson, seen in the opening scene, was originally assigned to. Ruby confers with Candy Cane and he ends up inviting her to go along with him to communist Cuba. Once in Cuba, Ruby meets with Vitali and they meet with the elderly and imprisoned Sicilian mobster Santos Alicante, who has been in jail in Cuba since the 1959 communist takeover after his casino hotel was closed down. Vitali tells Ruby that they are to spring Santos from Cuba to put him back in place in the USA as part of a complex operation plan. However, after their visit, Vitali accompanies Ruby back to his and Candy's hotel room where he secretly tells him the real reason for this assignment; he wants Ruby to kill Santos because the people that Vitali works for feel that Santos has outgrown his usefulness to them. Vitali gives Ruby an 8&nbsp;mm film camera that has a pistol encased in it to carry out the killing. But that evening, Ruby instead kills Vitali on the dock near the prison and springs Santos from his cell by bribing the guards, and then he, Santos, and Candy flee Cuba aboard Vitali's boat back to America. After arriving in New Orleans, Ruby makes contact with David Ferrie, an old friend from his days in Chicago, to supply him with the necessary papers enabling Santos to re-enter the country. Shortly after, Ruby and Candy return to Dallas, while Santos goes off on his own.  Several months later, Ruby, still managing the Carousel Club in which Candy is now the star attraction, has an encounter one evening when Candy's estranged and abusive husband, Hank, shows up and confronts her after the show in her apartment, wanting her to return to him. Ruby beats up Candy/Sheryl Ann's husband and warns him never to come back to the club.  The next day, a mysterious man, identifying himself only by his name of 'Maxwell', pays a visit to Ruby at the currently closed club to talk with him about the killing of Vitali and of the release of Santos from Cuba. With a clearly implied threat of arrest and incarceration, Maxwell wants Ruby to redeem himself to the people that Maxwell works for by being an informant for him on Santos, who has since opened up a new hotel and casino in Las Vegas since his return to the United States as well as Santos' affiliates. Maxwell supplies Ruby with a mini-tape recorder to assist, and Ruby makes the assumption that Maxwell works for the CIA, which Maxwell neither denies or admits.  Ruby and Candy travel to Las Vegas and check into Santos' new hotel, where a gala event is taking place that involves a stage performance by singer Tony Montana. Ruby is also suspicious when a helicopter arrives and drops off the President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, who is attending the event. Candy attends the event with David Ferrie, who sits with her at the table where the president is sitting, while Ruby sits with Santos and several like-minded people who are clearly connected to organized crime. Recording the conversation, the men want Ruby to smuggle into Cuba "special cigars" for Fidel Castro to assassinate him for the loss of all their casinos and business since the 1959 takeover. When Ruby excuses himself to go outside, he meets with Maxwell in the hotel parking lot, where he drives Ruby outside the city and reveals another assignment for him to partake in the assassination of a prominent official, implying it to be Castro.  The next day, Candy tells Ruby that the people that Santos works with want her to stay in Las Vegas to perform as a singer in their hotels, thanks to some presidential connections that she managed to get hold of. Ruby returns to Dallas alone, while he makes use of free time by shooting at watermelons and other targets from a distance in preparation for his next assassination assignment.  Sometime later, Ruby talks with Lenny, an old friend of his, about assignments for CIA associates and Lenny tells Ruby that to take out a "target" relies on two or more rifle marksmen and a "patsy" or "[[fall guy]]" to be caught in order to place all the blame for the crime to divert suspicion away from the investigating authorities.  Meanwhile, Diego the bartender meets with David Ferrie where they travel to New Orleans where they make contact with Lee Harvey Oswald, whom they ask to talk about going in on a job.  Back in Dallas, Ruby meets with Santos, Sam Giaccana, and their men at another meeting where Giaccana tells Ruby that his assignment to take out Castro has been canceled because another matter has come up. Giaccana tells Ruby that the CIA has been having troubles with President Kennedy over the Cuba issue and wanting to reveal the CIA's true nature. After Ruby leaves, Giaccana meets with Maxwell for a talk.  Returning to his club, Ruby sees Candy there, who tells him that she quit her career tour which included performances for the President because she felt they were taking advantage of her and her charms. It is implied that Candy had shared some intimate time with Kennedy and possibly others. While Ruby and Candy decide to revise the club with a new classy act as a singing club, he begins to figure out what Maxwell and the mob associates are doing: planning a high-level assassination. Ruby tells his boss, Proby, that from his views and experiences in the past several months, the CIA and the Mafia work together to stage and carry out [[contract killing]]s, and get away with it by subcontracting third parties to carry out the work. Proby has some doubts, but he tells Ruby to leave the matter alone for he cannot blow the lid on a complex conspiracy such as this.  On November 22, 1963, JFK arrives in Dallas where Maxwell meets with Oswald, Diego, and two other henchmen, where he tells them their assignments. While Ruby is at a newspaper office to file a new listing for his club, Candy is watching the President's limo convoy ride through the city. It is shown that Diego, with Oswald as the handler, shoots Kennedy from the sixth-floor window of the Dallas Book Depository, while the second assassin, and his handler, fire the fatal shot, killing Kennedy from the grassy knoll section near the building to the building.  After watching the events on a TV set, a distraught Ruby returns to his club, where Proby is rummaging through his desk to look for the audio tape of the recording of the conversation Ruby had in Las Vegas with Santos and his associates, but the tape is gone. Ruby tells Proby, who has not heard about the assassination, that their enemies have won. The following day, David Ferrie pays a visit to Ruby at the club where they watch a TV broadcast about the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald and that he also was arrested for killing Officer Tippit, a regular customer at the club. Ferrie tells Ruby to forget that they ever met and that he shouldn't do anything stupid for he calls Ruby only a "small time hood". Ruby vows he will make the world understand.  The next day, Ruby goes to the Dallas county jail where Oswald is being transferred and kills him. Ruby is immediately arrested by the police—just as he wanted them to. In jail, Ruby refuses to give a statement to his lawyer about his motivation and demands that he be taken to Washington to testify before a Senate committee about what he knows. At Ruby's trial, he refuses to offer an insanity defense for the murder of Oswald and is convicted and sentenced to death. Ruby sees Maxwell as one of the spectators during the trial and knows that Maxwell had some hand in work behind the scenes that has led to his conviction. Ruby appeals the verdict, but aware that the conspirators are monitoring his visits, continues to demand that he be taken to Washington to testify, but he is refused.  Several months later, while still in prison awaiting an appeal, Candy visits Ruby to offer him moral support for his actions, while he tells her not to visit him again and to move far away so the members of the conspiracy will not find her. After Candy leaves Ruby for good, he remains in jail while over the next several months, he thinks that the conspirators are slowly killing him inside when he is forcibly given injections for his failing health. In a final disclaimer, it is said that Ruby died from cancer in jail in 1967 and that his request to testify before a Senate hearing was never granted.

Samurai Vampire Bikers from Hell
 This film follows the lead character, ''Alexander Hell'', played by Shaw, as he rides his [[Harley Davidson]] motorcycle out from the dark abyss to battle [[samurai sword]] carrying [[Vampires]] who are unleashing their vengeance on modern day [[Hollywood, California]]. Once on earth, Hell joins forces with an ancient [[Asian people|Asian]] vampire, ''Sir Katana'' who is played by [[Kenneth H. Kim]].   This film is one of Scott Shaw's early directorial works.  Nonetheless, this film shows the direction of abstract filmmaking Shaw has continued into his later feature films: *The film follows a non-linear storyline.  *It contains many [[music video]] style references where the central characters leave behind the storyline and interact solely by the presentation of visual images in association with [[techno music]]. *It is divided by unexpected edits. *The film is considered a "Zen film," as part of a distinct style of filmmaking formulated by Scott Shaw in which no scripts or screenplays are used.  
Sadayam
  Sathyanathan (Mohanlal) is condemned to death for brutally murdering four persons – two adults and two young girls – and is awaiting his final call. He shows no remorse and is just as cheerful as a man who knows he has done no wrong. The prison doctor Dr Nambiar’s (Thilakan) son Vijayan is one of Sathyan’s victims; he wants to sign his death certificate and see the fear in his eyes as he is led up the gallows but the doctor is just as puzzled as to why the crime was committed.  There are appeals in lower courts and petitions for pardons by the cops as a matter of routine but Sathyan has no great interest in living. Eventually, when he wishes to start life again on a fresh slate because he now wants to live,  in an O Henry-sque moment, he’s denied a pardon and on Sept 29th, 1991, two years after he is originally convicted of the multiple murders, he is hanged to death. In a series of flashbacks, the story unfolds focussing on Sathyan’s past and recreates the chilling crime scene, explaining his actions.  Sathyan is a ‘bastard’ who is bullied and abused in his childhood by the people around him until he is rescued by a priest (Nedumudi Venu) who realises that the kid is a talented artist. Under the aegis of Father, Sathyan becomes a painter who makes a living by painting sign boards and hoardings. As part of one of his assignments, he takes a rented house in Kozhikode next to a house of ill-virtue where Jaya (Mathu) and her two young sisters live with their aunts. They have no future to look forward to and it is only a matter of time when the aunts get them to carry out prostitution.  He helps the kids in their education and gets Jaya a job in the company in which he’s working.  Sathyan likes Jaya and wishes to marry her and settle down in life but destiny has other ideas; circumstances force her to end up as a prostitute and there are signs that her sisters will sink in the same quagmire later. In a moment of extreme paranoia, Sathyan kills the two girls in a bid to save them from prostitution and eventually both the guys responsible for her state.  As a product of a broken household, Sathyan is immensely disturbed when he sees the girls headed into a bottomless pit where there is no escape. There is a sense of extreme helplessness and resignation of the fact that despite his efforts to rescue Jaya, he is unable to do so. He seeks his redemption through an act which represents an angst against society for its attitudes towards human trafficking. He does not regret his actions but later on as the movie progresses to a juncture when there are moments of contemplation and solitude, he is unsure about his act.  The multiple-murder scene is a slightly elaborate but extremely chilling piece that has a frightening feel to it. You know that it will culminate in a murder but the thought still does not prepare you for what you see. It is largely shot in close-up and seeks to transform his character into a wild demonic one, as indicated in his painting. The atmosphere is built gradually with tense background music and the usage of dim lights with a red tinge, magnifying the impact of the gruesomeness of the scene. When Minikutty comes running to him escaping from the broker Chandran, it is a moment of déjà vu for Sathyan. He believes that his actions can only delay the inevitable and there is no escape for the kids and that one day or the other, they will be forced into the flesh trade.  It is not a planned murder but is also not something that happens in the heat of the moment. Eliminating just the perpetrators will not help, he reckons, because in some form of the other, they will eventually make their appearance and destroy the lives of the hitherto innocent kids; the society will never allow them to survive with dignity. A sense of moral uprightness coupled with desperation and extreme paranoia drives him to stab them to death.

Scent of a Woman (1992 film)
 Charlie Simms is a student at the Baird School, an exclusive New England [[University-preparatory school#United States and Canada|prep school]]. Unlike most of his peers, Charlie was not born into a wealthy family, and attends the school on a scholarship. To pay for a flight home to [[Oregon]] for Christmas, Charlie accepts a temporary job over [[Thanksgiving]] weekend looking after retired [[United States Army Rangers|Army Ranger]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Frank Slade, whom Charlie discovers to be a cantankerous, blind alcoholic.  Charlie and George Willis, Jr., another student at the Baird School, witness three students setting up a prank that publicly humiliates the headmaster, Mr. Trask. Incensed over the prank, Trask quickly learns of the two student witnesses and presses Charlie and George to divulge the names of the perpetrators. Once George has left the office, Trask offers Charlie a bribe: a letter of recommendation that would virtually guarantee his acceptance to [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. Charlie remains silent, but is conflicted about what to do.  Shortly after Charlie arrives, Frank unexpectedly whisks Charlie off on a trip to [[New York City]]. Frank reserves a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]]. During dinner at the [[Oak Room (Plaza Hotel)|Oak Room]], Frank glibly states the goals of the trip, which involve enjoying luxurious accommodations in New York before committing [[suicide]]. Charlie is taken aback and does not know if Frank is serious.  They pay an uninvited visit to Frank's brother's home in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]] for Thanksgiving dinner. Frank is an unpleasant surprise for the family, as he deliberately provokes everyone and the night ends in acrimony. During this time, the cause of Frank's blindness is also revealed: he was juggling live hand grenades, showing off for a group of second lieutenants, and one of the grenades exploded.  As they return to New York City, Charlie tells Frank about his complications at school. Frank advises Charlie to inform on his classmates and go to Harvard, warning him that George will probably give in to the pressure to talk, and Charlie had better cash in before George does. Later at a restaurant, Frank is aware of Donna, a young woman waiting for her date. Although blind, Frank leads Donna in a spectacular [[Tango (dance)|tango]] (''"[[Por una Cabeza]]"'') on the dance floor. That night, he hires a [[Call girl|female escort]].  Deeply despondent the next morning, Frank is initially uninterested in Charlie's proposals for something to do until he suggests they test drive a [[Ferrari Mondial#Mondial t|Ferrari Mondial t]]. Frank smooth-talks the initially-reluctant Ferrari dealership salesman into letting Charlie, who Frank says is his son, test-drive the car. Once on the road, Frank is unenthusiastic until Charlie allows him to drive, quickly getting the attention of a police officer. Once again being calm and charming in a potentially difficult situation, Frank talks the officer into letting them go without giving away his blindness.  When they return to the hotel, Frank sends Charlie out on a list of errands. Charlie initially leaves the room but quickly becomes suspicious. Charlie returns to find Frank in his full dress blues uniform, preparing to commit suicide with a pistol from which Charlie had made Frank promise to remove the bullets earlier. Frank simply says "I lied" as he loads the sidearm. Charlie intervenes and attempts to grab Frank's pistol. Frank, however, easily overpowers him, threatening to shoot Charlie before himself. They enter a tense fight, with both grappling for the gun; however, Frank backs down after Charlie bravely calms him. The two return to New England.  At school, Charlie and George are subjected to a formal inquiry in front of the entire student body and the student/faculty disciplinary committee. As Headmaster Trask is opening the proceedings, Frank unexpectedly returns to the school, joining Charlie on the auditorium stage for support. For his defense, George has enlisted the help of his wealthy father, using his poor vision as an excuse before naming all three of the perpetrators. When pressed for more details, George passes the burden to Charlie. Although struggling with his decision, Charlie gives no information, so Trask recommends Charlie's expulsion.  Frank cannot contain himself and launches into a passionate speech defending Charlie and questioning the integrity of a school that punishes students for defending their classmates and rewards those for snitching. Frank reveals that there was an attempt to buy Charlie's testimony and that regardless of whether his silence is right or wrong, Charlie refuses to sell anybody out to advance his future. Frank tells the committee that Charlie has shown integrity in his actions and insists they don't expel him because this is what great leaders are made of, and promises that if allowed to continue on, Charlie will make them proud in the future. After brief deliberations, the disciplinary committee decide to place the students named by George on probation, deny George of any accolades for his testimony and excuse Charlie from punishment, allowing him to have no further involvement in the proceedings. On this announcement, the hall erupts to thunderous applause from the students.  As Charlie escorts Frank to his limo, a female political science teacher, Christine Downes, who is part of the disciplinary committee, approaches him, commending him for his speech. Seeing a spark between them, Charlie tells Downes that Frank served on [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s staff. In their brief encounter, Frank deftly establishes Downes is single and surprises her by correctly identifying her perfume scent as Fleurs de Rocaille; they agree to get together sometime and "talk politics".  Charlie takes Frank home. The colonel walks towards his house and happily greets his niece's young children as Charlie watches by the limo.  
Schtonk!
 Fritz Knobel (the film's alter-ego of real-life forger [[Konrad Kujau]]) supports himself by faking and selling Nazi memorabilia. He sells a portrait of [[Eva Braun]] and one volume of Hitler's alleged diaries to factory owner Karl Lenz. Lenz presents this to his guests during a "birthday party for the ''Führer''", among whom is sleazy journalist Hermann Willié. Willié works for the magazine ''"HH press"'', which links to [[Hamburg]] (as a licence plate abbreviation), where the ''Stern'' magazine, is located and also to the common abbreviation for "''Heil Hitler''" among neo nazis. Knobel writes the subsequent diaries based on what happens around him; after he meets Martha and she becomes his lover beside his wife Biggi, she also becomes his inspiration for Eva Braun in the diaries. The rumors about his work cause a major nazi [[fad|craze]] among the high society, allowing former nazi officials to use openly their nazi ranks (e.g. [[Obergruppenführer]]). Willié becomes even more obsessed buying the old [[yacht]] ''Carin II'' of [[Hermann Göring]] and starting an affair with his (fictional) grandniece Freya von Hepp.  Towards the end, the plot has developed its own dynamics, putting more and more pressure on Knobel to deliver the remaining volumes while permanently fearing the uncovering of the [[forgery]]. The volumes are convincing enough to fool the enthusiastic journalists, who are willing to overlook some oddities, especially a false monogram "FH" instead of "AH" on one of the volumes. They even invent ''alternative facts'' for their explanation (the term "[[Führer]] Hitler" instead of "Adolf Hitler" for instance). Later Knobel manages to manipulate a [[Graphology|forensic graphoanalysis]] to his advance but it seems only a matter of time until the truth is discovered. The constant fear and the struggle with a too close identification with the person he is writing about make Knobel collapse. His two spouses take over the initiative forcing him to pull himself out of the forgery business just in time, while the others fall, similar to the [[End of World War II in Europe|end of World War II]], more or less hard according to their personal level of belief.  
School Ties
 David Greene ([[Brendan Fraser]]) is a working-class [[Jews|Jewish]] teenager from [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], during the 1950s who is given a football scholarship to St. Matthew's, an exclusive [[Massachusetts]] prep school, for his senior year due to his grades and ability to play football. Upon his arrival, he meets his teammates Rip Van Kelt ([[Randall Batinkoff]]), Charlie Dillon ([[Matt Damon]]), Jack Connors ([[Cole Hauser]]), and his roommate Chris Reece ([[Chris O'Donnell]]) and learns of the school's cherished honor code system. Soon learning that his new friends are [[antisemitism|prejudiced against Jews]], he suppresses his background.  David becomes the team hero and wins the attentions of beautiful débutante Sally Wheeler ([[Amy Locane]]), whom Dillon claims is his girlfriend. In the afterglow of a victory over the school's chief rival St. Luke's, Dillon inadvertently discovers that David is Jewish and, out of jealousy, makes this widely known, causing Sally and his teammates to turn against David—soon after, he finds a sign above his bed bearing a [[swastika]] and the words "Go home Jew". David is constantly harassed by his classmates, led by Richard "McGoo" Collins ([[Anthony Rapp]]) and his bodyguard-like roommate Chesty Smith ([[Ben Affleck]]); only Reece and another unnamed student remain loyal to Greene.  Overwhelmed by pressure from his prestigious family, Dillon uses a crib sheet to cheat in an important history exam. David and Van Kelt each spot him doing so, but remain silent. Dillon gets pushed while leaving class and drops the sheet on the floor after the test; when the teacher, Mr. Geirasch ([[Michael Higgins (actor)|Michael Higgins]]), discovers it, he informs the class that he will fail all of them if the cheater does not confess. He leaves the task of finding the cheater up to the students, led by Van Kelt, the head prefect.  When David confronts Dillon and threatens to turn him in if he does not confess, Dillon unsuccessfully attempts to buy David's silence with money. Just when David is about to reveal Dillon to the other students, Dillon accuses David. Both agree to leave and to trust the rest of the class to decide who is telling the truth. The majority of the class blame David out of anti-Semitic prejudice, while Reece, the unnamed student, and Connors, going against his own self-professed anti-Semitism, argue that it is unlike David to cheat or be dishonest. Despite this, the class votes that David is guilty, prompting Van Kelt to tell him to report to the elitist headmaster, Dr. Bartram ([[Peter Donat]]), to confess to cheating.  David goes to Bartram's office and says that he was the cheater, but unbeknownst to him, Van Kelt has already told the headmaster that the real offender was Dillon. Bartram tells David and Van Kelt that they should have reported the offense, but absolves them; Dillon, meanwhile, is expelled. As David leaves the headmaster's office, he sees Dillon leaving the school. Dillon says that he will be accepted to Harvard anyway and that years later everybody will have forgotten about his cheating at school, while David will still just be a Jew. "And you'll still be a prick," David replies, and walks away.

Second Glance (film)
 A young Christian, Daniel ([[David A. R. White]]) is in public [[high school]]. He feels as if his religion is placing too many restrictions on him and he wishes to have some freedom from biblical teachings so that he can be more popular and go out with the girl he likes. One night Daniel wishes that he had "never become a believer," and the next day he has a rude awakening. His room is different, his house is dirty, and an [[angel]] meets him and explains to him that the "Heavenly Father" answered his prayer and now his life is as if he never became a Christian. He soon finds out that the two bullies at school are now his best friends and at school he enjoys the fact that the girl he really liked now likes him too.   But all is not well. He goes on to learn that his younger sister no longer exists because his parents got divorced years ago in his alternate life. He is also shocked when his mom prances off to go on a date with someone other than his father (who moved to Los Angeles.) The angel appears and points out his nice car which Daniel got by betting money on football games last year. Daniel says he has never gambled in his life but the angel points out that his life is different now and it is as if he had never been a believer. Daniel also thinks the whole thing a big prank and he does not believe the angel at all.  That night 'Dan' goes to a party which, as a Christian, he would not have attended because alcohol was served. While there, Daniel learns that Scotty Parks, a kid who he had helped convert to Christianity, had committed suicide weeks ago in this alternate reality because Daniel had not been there to talk with him about the [[Bible]]. Daniel also gets into some girl trouble and is framed by one of the girls which sends 'Bull,' her boyfriend and a school tough-guy, in pursuit of Daniel. Daniel almost gets hit by a car but makes it to a church where he pounds on the doors, but because they are locked, Bull gets him cornered. But, right before 'Danny-Boy' is pummeled he sees that his shirt has turned back to blue - what it was when he was a Christian, a day before. Bull holds out his hands caringly toward the cringing Daniel and asks him "What's wrong?" and said he saw Daniel banging on a church door in the night and stopped to see what was going on. Daniel says that he is OK and Bull soon leaves.   The angel appears and asks Daniel if he still wished he was a non-believer. They have a conversation and Daniel sees that he really would rather be a Christian and not get into the mess his life became ever again. The next morning he is pleasantly surprised that his sister still lives and his dad is still home. He goes to school and is happy that even though he may not be popular with the 'in crowd,' he was still making a bigger difference than he thought among his friends and others in school. After talking to Scotty, Dan turns back toward camera and says excitedly, "Hey Scotty, ... Jesus, man!" as the credits roll.

While paying her respects for the Cryptus family, Frieda is introduced to Michael Cryptus (Géza Kovács), son of Leo Cryptus.

Sidekicks (1992 film)
 Barry Gabrewski is an [[asthma]]tic boy who lives with his widowed father, Jerry Gabrewski ([[Beau Bridges]]), in [[Houston, Texas]]. A loner, Barry has vivid [[daydream]]s about being [[Chuck Norris]]' sidekick, battling against Norris's movie enemies, who are often personified by Barry's everyday bullies such as Randy Cellini (John Buchanan). Noreen Chan ([[Julia Nickson-Soul]]), his favorite teacher, often plays the damsel in distress in these daydreams.  Barry wants to learn the martial arts, but is rejected by the arrogant dojo owner Kelly Stone ([[Joe Piscopo]]) for being too weak. Instead, he is taken on as a student by an old Chinese man called Mr. Lee ([[Makoto Iwamatsu|Mako]]), the sly uncle of his teacher and the owner of a local Chinese restaurant, "Frying Dragon". Mr. Lee finds creative ways to teach Barry to defend himself from his bullies. Lee devises training methods that increase Barry's endurance, which helps his asthma. Lee also deduces Barry's hero worship of Norris and from that, deduces at least some of Barry's daydreams. He creatively incorporates this into Barry's training, creating training scenarios that seem more dangerous than they are so that Barry will feel heroic for succeeding at them.  Lee enters himself, Barry, and Chan into a local team Karate tournament but is a bit stymied to learn that a team must have four members. Norris is attending the tournament as a guest. Chan (at Lee's urging) convinces Norris to join the team. Norris is both willing to help an ardent fan and has his own motivation for participating: he has encountered Stone on several prior occasions and wants to teach him "a lesson in humility." Barry is stunned to find himself working together with his hero.  The tournament involves four events: [[Breaking (martial arts)|Breaking]], Men's Weapons, Female Kata, and Freestyle fighting. Stone's team narrowly defeats Chan in the Female Kata, but Lee defeats Cellini, one of Stone's students, in Breaking. True to his word, Norris defeats Stone in Freestyle fighting. Barry—aided by a vivid daydream—scores a victory in Men's Weapons. The result is a tie between Stone's team and Lee's team. In the tie-breaker, Lee is allowed to choose the participants, and chooses Barry and Cellini, saying Barry is the member of the team with "something to prove." Stone chooses the event, Breaking. Barry is dismayed to be confronting Cellini in the latter's best event but Lee tilts the odds in Barry's favor by using a small amount of lighter fluid to set Barry's bricks on fire. Faced with a much more heroic-seeming task, Barry wins.  After the tournament, Barry is seen talking to Norris, thanking him for his help. Norris vanishes, and it is implied that Barry has found the strength to live his life without the need for his daydreams. Before the movie fades to black, a young boy finds Barry's Chuck Norris magazine. With an excited "Wow" the camera pans out to reveal the young man is in a wheelchair.

One night, she witnesses her [[Gangster|mobster]] boyfriend Vince LaRocca execute his [[chauffeur]] as a [[Tattle Tale|rat]]. Lieutenant Eddie Souther persuades her to go into a [[Witness protection|witness protection program]] at St. Katherine's Parish, a [[convent]] in a run-down San Francisco neighborhood. The stoic Reverend Mother finds Deloris uncouth, but Monsignor O'Hara, the neighborhood priest, persuades her to accept her.  Deloris, given the [[religious name|name]] Sister Mary Clarence, struggles to adapt to convent life. However, she befriends several of the nuns, including [[Happiness|jolly]] Sister Mary Patrick, [[Meekness|meek]] Sister Mary Robert, and the [[Old age|elderly]] [[deadpan]] Sister Mary Lazarus, who works as a choir director. After Mary Clarence is chastised for sneaking out to a [[bar]], the Reverend Mother assigns her to the local choir, who are known by the convent to be dreadful, to keep her out of trouble. On her first day, Mary Clarence is elected by Mary Lazarus to become the choir director, after its members learn she has a background in music.  With Sister Mary Lazarus’ help, she helps to rearrange the [[choir]] and trains them to become better singers. When they next perform at [[mass]], the [[choir]] sings "[[Salve Regina|Hail Holy Queen]]" beautifully in its traditional manner, before shifting into a [[gospel music|gospel]] and rock-and-roll-infused performance of the hymn. Although the Reverend Mother is infuriated, O'Hara congratulates the choir's unorthodox performance for bringing in people, including teenagers, off the streets and into the church, leading Mary Clarence to convince him to have the nuns head outside and clean up the neighborhood. The choir continue to wow church visitors with their music, including a performance of "[[My Guy]]" (appropriately rewritten as "My God") and soon help to transform the neighborhood, despite Souther being slightly annoyed at Deloris for nearly exposing her location on national television because of the nuns work.   Eventually, the convent learns from O'Hara that [[Pope John Paul II]] is to visit the church to see the choir himself, as part of his visit to the United States. Believing herself to be no longer required, the Reverend Mother decides to hand in her resignation because of Mary Clarence's work unintentionally undermining her authority, which shocks Deloris, having learned she will have to leave soon as Vince's trial draws close to beginning. Souther soon arrests a police detective within his own department, upon discovering he was on Vince's payroll and had uncovered information on Deloris' location. Heading to San Francisco to warn Deloris that her cover is blown, Souther arrives just as Vince's men [[Kidnapping|abduct]] her.   When the nuns learn of the kidnapping, the Reverend Mother reveals the truth of Mary Clarence's real identity. Upon hearing them feel at a loss without her help in the choir, she decides to have them come with her and risk their lives to save her. Arriving at Vince's casino, the group search for Deloris and find her, after she manages to escape from Vince and his men once again. The group quickly attempt to confuse the mobsters while sneaking out Deloris, but wind up becoming trapped in the casino's lounge. Not wishing to risk the group's lives, Deloris prepares to sacrifice herself, but is saved when police led by Souther arrive to [[arrest]] Vince and his men. Despite being annoyed at the risk and other things Deloris did to the convent, the Reverend Mother thanks her for what she has done and decides to remain at the convent to continue her work. Returning to San Francisco, the choir, led by Deloris, sing "[[I Will Follow Him]]" to packed audience in the refurbished St. Katherine's church, receiving a [[standing ovation]] from all, including the [[Pope]].

Later Allie sees a news report on Sam's death, realizes what has happened and tries to leave. Hedy takes Allie hostage at gunpoint. She states that everyone will assume Allie killed Sam since Hedy and Allie resemble each other. In order to "protect" Allie, Hedy tries to convince her that they must run away. When Hedy leaves, Allie attempts to send a distress message, but Hedy catches her and angrily confronts her.  Myerson in the meantime notices his files being erased and rushes off to find Allie. He finds her tied up on the floor and tries to free her but is attacked and killed by Hedy. Hedy attempts to persuade Allie to commit suicide via drug overdose, but Allie instead smashes the water glass in Hedy's face. The women struggle for the gun which Hedy points at Allie as she tries to run, begging Allie not to leave her. Allie coldly tells her, "I'm not like your sister, Hedy. Not anymore. I'm like you now." Graham regains consciousness and assists Allie but the enraged Hedy refuses to give up. Allie drags Hedy off her friend, flees, and is shot in the shoulder by Hedy.  A chase ensues from Graham's apartment to the elevator where Hedy chokes Allie unconscious and drags her towards the furnace. When Hedy finds Allie missing, she grabs a hook from a closet and screams for Allie to come out. Lured into thinking Allie is hiding in another closet, Hedy lashes out at a mirror inside. She is then stabbed in the back by Allie and they struggle briefly before Allie strikes one last blow. She then watches in horror and sadness as Hedy dies.  In an epilogue, Allie narrates that she has finally moved on. She forgives Hedy for killing Sam, and keeps trying to forgive herself for Hedy. She states that Hedy's [[Survivor guilt|survivor's guilt]] was her downfall. Allie mentions that she knows what happens to those people.

Further, they believe that it was Parvathy’s curse that killed them in a car accident and they get promise from the guardian, that their daughter should not be married to Parvathy's son. Velan’s mother reveals that it is Velan’s duty to get married to her brother's daughter Sumathi to bring the separated family back together. Armed with only a picture of the girl when she was four, he leaves for Madras to fulfill his mother’s wishes.  Velan arrives at his friend Mano's house to implement his mission. Mano lives with three more roommates: Charlie, Vadivelu and Goundamani. Velan greets them and explains his mission. All of them find the reason weird but still offer to help him.  The next day, they visit a computer centre where the clerk generates an image of the teenage Sumathi. Velan tries to find her in the city but Madras proves to be too big for him. Bored, he and his friends visit the beach to think for a plan. There, they find a woman playing tennis to be Sumathi, the girl they search for. Someone hits the ball into the sea and Sumathi, who goes to fetch the ball, and Velan goes to help her. But he accidentally drowns her but manage to pull an unconscious Sumathi out of the water. When she becomes conscious, she blames him for drowning her as she didn’t need any help as she was a trained long distance swimmer. Despite his friends' advice to drop the love for Sumathi due to her arrogant nature, Velan proceeds with next step of his mission as a challenge.  Later, Velan and his friends follow Sumathi to a 5-star restaurant. On the stage in the dining hall, a flautist is performing. Once the performance ends, Sumathi gets up and kisses the old flautist's hand. Velan too offers his hand to be kissed, wherein he is asked whether he knows anything about music. To prove her wrong, Velan dresses up in a fancy leather suit, adorned with various musical instruments, singing "Pudhu Cheri Katcheri". But Sumathi insults the performance. Velan on his part teases with harmless intention, which also earns Sumathi's dislike.   Velan meanwhile attempts to attract Thaiamma, the guardian of Sumathi by visiting her house daily. Thaiamma is attracted by Velan's entertaining nature. But she also confirms that he is not the son of Parvathi. Velan lies by saying his mother's name as Mahalakshmi. Though Thaiamma certifies Velan as a good chap, Sumathi continues to hate him. Sumathi’s uncle Natesan, who is a retired IG of police visits Velan to warn him to stop teasing his niece. There he comes to know about his father is an industrialist Kaliannan Gounder who has disowned him due to his passion for music. Unfortunately, he manages to meet the Industrialist to verify the Velan's family background and finds everything true via the mouth of industrialist.

She finds Velan dressed up with full bandages in his body (a drama by Velan who counter attacked the men sent by the uncle and instructs them to convey that the men attacked Velan, to Sumathi as part of the love mission). Velan's mother is informed about her son's hospitalization by a person from Madras and immediately rushes to see her son. There she understands that facts are not true and feels easy.

Siempre es difícil volver a casa
 The movie follows a group of four friends who arrive to a small town and [[Wedding crashing|crash a wedding party]] in the evening. That night they go out to a disco, and one of them hooks up with a girl. They both head to her place, where they engage in bizarre sexual acts at the bottom of an empty swimming pool.  The following day, the four friends rob a bank, but the getaway is complicated when a policeman spots them as they leave. They are forced to leave the car and split up: Ramiro and Cucurucho remain together and dash down the railroad tracks; they eventually get to a garage, where they hide, accidentally killing the mechanic. They split up: Ramiro stashes himself in a truck, which drives off, whereas Cucurucho hides in a monastery, attacking a group of nuns at gunpoint, and, later on, a blind woman's house. The driver (the man who had met the girl the night before) is pursued by an angry mob, who torches the shed he hides in. As he escapes he is shot; he in turn kills the boy that wounds him. Wading down the river, he manages to get to the girl's house, where she bandages him. Just then a policeman storms in. He is shot and killed, but not before shooting them both, as well as the aquarium they're behind. The fourth member has a friendly encounter with an artist, who helps him; later on he is pursued too and hides atop the church's belltower, holding a priest hostage. He is killed by a sniper.  Throughout the movie, various characters falsely attribute other crimes to the robbers as means of using them as scapegoats. A man asphyxiates his wife with a pillow and claims the robbers did it; a woman likewise accuses one of them of rape.  Ramiro has a brief sexual encounter with a woman, Susana. Cucurucho escapes the blind woman's house and reunites with Ramiro as he steals the very truck in which he was hiding. They have seemingly escaped when they're suddenly forced to stop in front of a cemetery, and are cornered by various arriving truckloads of angry villagers. The camera freezes on the duo as they are stoned by the mob in the cemetery. A text then appears on screen, telling that the following day everything in the village had reverted to normal, and that nobody ever knew what happened to the money.  
Sisila Gini Gani
 Harris Makalanda (Sanath Gunattilake) is a wealthy aristocrat and well known lawyer. He is also a married man to Kumari (Veena Jayakody). One day he meets a beautiful girl, Annette (Sabitha Perera), at a party. He meets her again when she hitches a ride with him during a heavy rain storm, which leads to a sexual encounter between them.<ref></ref>  She is of [[Burgher People|Sri Lankan Burgher]] ethnicity; her family background and experiences with married men convince her to shun marriage, which she sees as imprisonment. As their liaison grows, Harris invites Annette to live in his separate bungalow, which she agrees to. Along with renovating the dilapidated bungalow, Annette seems to renovate her notion on marriage, and expresses this to Harris.  Meanwhile, Harris is contesting the municipal elections, at the urging of his wife and in-laws. His schedule leaves him no time for Annette but she continues to relish his company. The only obstacle in Annette's path to possessing Harris, completely and permanently, is Harris’ little boy, Vijitha. Harris' son is mentally retarded, acting as the glue in Kumari and Harris' marriage of convenience.  Annette tries to establish a rapport with the son. Once when the child goes on a picnic with his school friends, Annette separates him from the others as a sudden mist rolls in. Frightened, the child runs away. She sees him heading for the abyss but as hard as she tries, she is unable to stop him.  This is the crux of the movie, allowing the story to pivot into flashbacks and flash forwards.  
Sleepwalkers (film)
  Charles Brady and his mother, Mary, are Sleepwalkers—nomadic, [[shapeshifting]] [[Psychic vampire|energy vampire]]s, who feed off the lifeforce of virgin women. Though they normally maintain a human form, they can transform (partially or fully) into human-sized [[bipedal]] [[werecat]]s (their natural form) at will. They are considerably more resilient than humans and have powers of both [[telekinesis]] and illusion. Their one weakness is cats, who are not only able to see through their illusions, but whose claws are capable of inflicting severe to fatal wounds upon them. It is revealed that they also maintain an [[incestuous]] relationship.  Charles and Mary have taken up residence in a small Indiana town, having recently fled [[Bodega Bay, California]] (where they used the [[pseudonym|aliases]] Martha and Carl Brodie) after draining and killing a young girl there. Charles attends the local high school, and there he meets [[Tanya Robertson]] in his creative writing class. Charles feigns romantic interest in Tanya in order to take her lifeforce for both himself and his mother, who is starving.  Tanya does not suspect the real reason Charles is interested in her. At first, it seems that Charles has genuinely fallen in love with Tanya (to the dismay of his jealous mother). On their first date, at a picnic at the nearby cemetery, Charles attempts to drain her lifeforce while kissing her. Tanya tries frantically to ward off Charles by bashing his head with her camera, scratching his face, and ultimately plunging a corkscrew into his left eye; though nothing she does seems to cause Charles more than temporary discomfort.  As this happens, Deputy Sheriff Andy Simpson (who had earlier tried to pull Charles over for speeding and seemingly trying to run down a young school girl while passing a stopped school bus) drives by the cemetery and notices Charles’ (now undisguised) car. When Tanya flees to him for help, Charles attacks Simpson and kills him. When Charles then turns to resume feeding off of Tanya, the deputy’s cat, Clovis, rises to the occasion and violently scratches him in the face and chest. Mortally wounded, Charles staggers back home to his mother who is able to make both of them "dim", i.e. turn themselves invisible, and thus keep Charles from being arrested when the police storm their house. Ominously, a small number of cats begin to gather outside their house.   Knowing that the only way for her dying son to survive is to feed, Mary attacks the Robertson household, killing several deputies and state troopers and severely wounding Tanya’s parents. She kidnaps Tanya and takes her back to her house.  Charles is near death, but Mary revives him, and Charles makes a final attempt to drain Tanya’s life force. However, Tanya plunges her fingers into his eyes, killing him. Tanya manages to escape with the help of the sheriff who is later impaled by Mary on the picket fence surrounding the house. The now large number of cats that have been gathering around their house throughout the movie, led by Clovis, all jump on Mary and claw her in a violent attack until she bursts into flames. As she dies, she screams that Tanya "killed her only son". The movie ends with Mary lying ablaze on her driveway and Tanya hugging Clovis, as her savior.<ref>[http://www.fangoria.com/reviews/3-dvd-a-blu-ray/3966-sleepwalkers-dvd-review.html Sleepwalkers (DVD Review)] </ref>  
Sneakers (1992 film)
  In 1969, students Martin Brice and Cosmo are [[Sneaker (computer security)|sneakers]] who hack into computer networks using university equipment, to redistribute conservative funds to various liberal causes. The police burst in and arrest Cosmo while Martin is out getting pizza, and Martin becomes a fugitive.  In the present day, Martin, now called Martin Bishop, is running a team of security specialists in San Francisco, including Donald Crease, a former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer and family man; Darren "Mother" Roskow, a [[conspiracy theorist]] and electronics technician; Carl Arbogast, a young hacking genius; and Irwin "Whistler" Emery, a blind phone [[Phreaking|phreak]].  Martin is approached by [[National Security Agency|NSA]] officers Dick Gordon and Buddy Wallace, who know of his former identity. In exchange for clearing his record, he's asked to recover a "black box" from mathematician Dr. Gunter Janek, who has developed the box under the project name "Setec Astronomy" supposedly for the Russian government. Martin is hesitant but agrees to help. With help from his former girlfriend, Liz, Martin and his team secure the box, which is disguised as a telephone answering machine. During their subsequent celebration party, Whistler, Mother, and Carl investigate the box, finding it capable of breaking the encryption of nearly every computer system. Martin works out that "Setec Astronomy" is an anagram of "too many secrets", and issues a lockdown until they can deliver the box the next day.  Martin hands the box to the NSA officers, but quickly leaves after Crease discovers that Janek was killed the night before. He contacts a friend named Gregor in the Russian consulate, who confirms that the officers were rogue agents, and that Janek was working for the NSA. Before Gregor can elaborate further, fake FBI agents kill him and kidnap Martin to a remote location where he's reunited with Cosmo, who Martin thought had died in prison. While in prison, Cosmo developed ties with organized crime, allowing him to escape and become wealthy. He explains his plan to use Janek's box to destabilize the world economy, and offers Martin the chance to join him. Martin refuses, whereupon Cosmo uses the box to break into the FBI and connect Martin's current identity with his former name. Cosmo has Martin knocked out and taken back to the city.  Martin contacts his team and they relocate to Liz's apartment. They contact NSA agent Abbott, who wants the box but cannot offer assistance without it being in Martin's possession. Whistler analyzes the sounds that Martin heard during his kidnapping, and is able to identify the geographic area where Martin was taken. They find a toy company at that location, which is a front for Cosmo's operation. They track down Werner Brandes, the employee whose office is next to Cosmo's. They set Liz up with a fake computer date with Brandes to get his keycard and vocal recognition codes, while the others identify other security features of Cosmo's office. The team successfully get into the building to recover the box.  Brandes begins to suspect Liz during the date, and alerts Cosmo to a possible break-in. Once Liz mentions the computer date in Cosmo's presence, he realizes that Martin is responsible and locks down the facility and holds Martin at gunpoint. Again he tries to convince Martin to join him, but Martin refuses and instead turns over the box. The team escapes before Cosmo realizes that he is holding an empty duplicate of the box's case.  Back at their offices, Martin's team is surrounded by agents led by Abbott. After Martin points out how important the secrecy of the box is to the NSA, who could use it to spy on other agencies, Abbott agrees to clear Martin's record and grant the requests of the rest of his team. After Abbott and the agents leave with the box, Martin shows his team he has rendered the box useless by taking out the main processor.  In a postscript, a news report describes the sudden bankruptcy of the [[Republican National Committee]], and the simultaneous receipt of large anonymous donations by [[Amnesty International]], [[Greenpeace]], and the [[United Negro College Fund]].  
Sleepaway Camp IV: The Survivor
 Allison Kramer (Carrie Chambers), a survivor from the original ''Sleepaway Camp,'' is plagued by nightmares that revisit the gruesome camp site. Unable to recall the actual occurrences due to a forced mental block, she seeks the help of a psychiatrist in overcoming her insomnia.  After numerous visits and hypnosis, Allison's psychiatrist tells her that she is a survivor of a camp massacre which occurred over a decade ago. Her disbelief of the whole situation inclines the psychiatrist to advise her to return to the site for an afternoon, in hopes that if she were to see the scene of the crime, she would remember and overcome them.  Doubtful, Allison sets out for the camp she attended but never remembered. When she reaches her destination she finds the camp closed and abandoned, the land now Federal Property. She reminisces about the events that occurred in the original trilogy. Allison narrates over many of these scenes. Archive footage from the first three films are organized into themes, such as Angela being afraid of water. Allison looks for a ranger, Jack (John Lodicos), that her psychologist, Dr. Lewis, told her to meet up with. The ranger tries to have sex with her, but Allison decides things are going too far and runs away. The ranger chases her through the woods. Allison stops as she can run no longer. She is found by a hunter, Eugene (Victor Campos), who almost shoots her out of fear. Later on, she approaches the ranger with the hunter's gun and threatens to kill him if he doesn't stay away from her. She then returns to the hunter and shoots him. In the next scene, Allison is standing in the sun with a knife, which the sun is reflecting off of. The ranger approaches her, but she whirls around and the film freezes as she holds the knife near him. It then cuts to a cabin, where you see the hunter's and the ranger's decaying bodies (There is an error, the hunter's corpse looks like T.C.'s but it's not T.C.'s). The credits then roll over the image.<ref>[http://www.sleepawaycampfilms.com/sc4survivor.pdf]</ref>  It is implied in the opening crawl that Allison may actually be Angela, the killer from the three previous films, as it states that she "is a woman without identity," and asks "But who is Allison, really?" This may also be supported by the fact that she had flashbacks of certain scenes throughout the original trilogy that only Angela was present for or survived through.  
Sly Fox and Birdie
  We see a yellow bird named Birdie wake up one morning. She decides that it is too nice a day to lie around in her nest, and she goes flying. She passes over trees, rooftops, [[playground]]s, and finally [[railroad track]]s. She spots her friend Sly Fox right near them.  Birdie asks what he is doing, and we learn that Sly Fox is going to put a few items on the tracks (a rock, a can, an old spike), assuming that when the train "comes roarin' by, it'll squash them to pieces!" A fearful Birdie tells him that it is a bad idea and gives Sly Fox a "thinking cap," telling him that when the train comes by, it won't squash them, it'll send them shooting out like bullets, or could have the train derailed and overturned, thus leading to possible injury or death.  Sly Fox comprehends this, but instead chooses to wait for the train to come so he can throw the items at it. Birdie informs him that the engineer might get hurt with the things he throws, and suggests they do something else that is fun, like going to the park. Sly Fox suggests that Birdie go get herself a [[worm]].  The fox comes across some [[boxcar]]s, and hops into one, assuming that they can't hurt anyone. But then, Birdie shows up and tells him that a locomotive could be at the end of the line, and if it coupled with the last car and start moving, the boxcar they're standing in would shake, and (again) they could be injured or killed. Sly Fox hops out of the car and decides that they should take a hike ''on'' the railroad tracks.  Birdie points out that it is dangerous to cross tracks, especially on [[bridge]]s and [[tunnel]]s, the latter of which finally convinces Sly Fox about the dangers of railroads (he is run over in the process, to which he replies "If I weren't a cartoon character, I'd be dead as a doornail.") Sly now decides that he would just stand and wave at the train as it goes by; Birdie points out that he shouldn't be too close, pointing out that they could be carrying heavy objects.  Sly and Birdie talk about what to do at railroad crossings: stop if a train is coming and obey the signs and signals. If your car stalls on the tracks and won't budge, get out as fast as you can (the latter is demonstrated by Sly parking his car on a crossing, then abandoning the car before it explodes as a train hits it.)  Sly Fox comments on how Birdie is a lifesaver, and hopes that other people can learn from her. Birdie [[breaks the fourth wall]] by telling him that people ''have'' been watching them, and Sly Fox hopes that they have learned a lesson from all of this. The movie ends with the two parting off.

  In the year 2008, [[global warming]] and heavy rainfall has left large areas of London flooded. Rookie police officer Dick Durkin is assigned to partner with Harley Stone, a burnt-out and highly cynical veteran homicide detective who, according to his [[commanding officer]], survives on "anxiety, coffee and chocolate" after being unable to prevent the murder of his partner by a serial killer several years previously. Now however, the murders have begun again and Stone and Durkin are assigned the case. After investigating the scenes of several killings, they appear no closer to identifying the killer, with their only clues being that the murders seem to be linked to the lunar cycle, and that the killer has multiple [[recombinant DNA]] strands, having absorbed the DNA of the victims.  Finally, after Stone's girlfriend Michelle is kidnapped, the detectives track the killer deep into the flooded and disused [[London Underground]] system and discover the truth: the killer is not human. It's a horrific and possibly demonic form of life that is fast, savage, bloodthirsty and fixated upon killing Stone just as it previously killed his partner. In fact, as the movie progresses, each killing and "appearance" of the monster is an attempt to lure Stone closer and closer.  During a tense battle in and around an abandoned underground train, Michelle is found suspended over the water as bait, but Stone is able to pull the monster's heart from its chest and kill it. However, as the policemen leave the scene with Michelle in a rescue dinghy, bubbles of air are seen breaking the surface of the water, suggesting that there may be more than one monster.  
South Central (film)
 Bobby Johnson is a young [[black (people)|black]] gang member of Hoover Street Deuces, or simply "Deuce". He gets paroled from the Youth Authority and he meets up with his best friend/fellow gang member Ray Ray, Loco and Bear. As it turns out, Bobby's girlfriend Carole gave birth to his son Jimmy while he was incarcerated. The Deuce gang goes out to a club owned by rival drug dealer Genie Lamp to celebrate Bobby's release, but Genie confronts them and threats are exchanged.  As Bobby and Jimmy attempt to return home from the party, they are approached by Genie Lamp and his bodyguard. The two force Bobby to come to Genie's apartment and snort a line of what he thought was cocaine, but is actually heroin. Genie threatens Bobby and the Deuce gang while he is incapacitated. Bobby returns home the next morning to find that Genie has given some of the same heroin to Carole and flies into a fit of rage. Bobby informs Ray Ray and the Deuce gang makes plans to execute Genie Lamp. They grab Genie in an abandoned warehouse. Despite Genie's pleas for forgiveness, Bobby carries out the execution by firing a gun through a potato into Genie's heart, and the gang flees the area as they hear the police sirens approaching. Later that evening, Ray Ray gives Bobby his "heart", a small tattoo below the left eyelid which is a symbol of full initiation into the Deuce gang and can only be earned by killing an enemy. Later, Bobby comes homes panicking over police looking for him and tells Carole to pack her things and they gotta move.  Some time later, Bobby and Carole are in hiding from the police who are pursuing Genie's murderers. Bobby looks out the window and Ken Dog, another Deuce gang member, pulls up with Loco in a brand new convertible. Ken Dog and Loco solicit the services of a prostitute who turns out to be an undercover cop and arrests them. The guys are taken to jail and Bobby is questioned by a detective for the murder of Genie Lamp. Bobby refuses to cooperate despite overwhelming evidence against him and the police allow him to see his son one last time. Bobby gets a ten-year prison sentence for the murder he committed.  Nearly ten years later, Jimmy is now with the Deuce gang, and meets with Ray Ray. Ray Ray informs Jimmy that he wants him to start stealing car stereos for him and Ray Ray will pay him for the stolen goods. Ray Ray then gives Jimmy some money and a marijuana joint.  The next scene switches over to Bobby who is in prison lifting weights, and defending his gangster pal, Loco, from a white supremacist-Aryan gang he is indebted over cigarettes with. Because of his interference, the Aryan gang puts a price on Bobby's head, as he inherits Loco's debt.  Over time, the film shows Jimmy stealing car stereos and selling them to Ray Ray for $20.00 a piece. While stealing one night, Jimmy is caught by Willie Manchester, the owner of the car, and is shot in the back.  He is taken to a hospital where he fights for his life. When the news of this reaches Bobby in prison, he leaves the Deuce gang immediately. But not without revenge from the Aryan gang, due to his inherited debt. The Aryan gang eventually captures, assaults and attempts to rape Bobby, only to be interfered by a prison Muslim group, led by Ali. Ali agrees to pay Bobby's debt (with interest) to the Aryans, with Bobby joining Muslim group in exchange.  After months of rehabilitation and mentoring, Ali encourages Bobby to get an education and to go straight when he gets out of prison in order to be a better father to his child (it is revealed during these conversations that Ali is serving a life sentence without parole for murder, and wishes Bobby not to follow in his footsteps). Ali and his associates even remove the Deuce "heart" from Bobby's face. Meanwhile, Jimmy recovers from his gunshot wounds, but is taken to a boys home for the crime he committed because the court has declared Carole an unfit mother.  Bobby is released from prison and goes to the boys home to visit Jimmy. Jimmy is thrilled to meet him and the two begin to talk, but Jimmy is shocked that his father has denounced the Deuce gang and will not seek revenge against Willie Manchester for shooting him. Jimmy leaves the room in anger and insults Bobby for not being the proud Deuce gang leader that Jimmy thought his father would be.  Sometime later, Bobby goes to visit Ray Ray.  Ray Ray is initially happy to see Bobby saying the Deuce gang owes him "ten years of their lives" for the time he served in prison. However, Bobby is shocked to find Jimmy has run away from the boys home and Manchester has been taken hostage. Despite Manchester explaining his actions and begging for forgiveness, Ray Ray gives Jimmy a gun and instructs him to kill Manchester in revenge so he can get his "heart" just like his father did. Bobby tries to intervene but is subdued by Bear.  Bobby eventually overpowers Bear, takes his gun, and steps in front of Manchester threatening to kill Ray Ray if this goes any further. He then tells Jimmy that committing a crime against a man can be rectified, but killing a man can't. He tells Ray Ray that the gang owes him ten years and can repay him by giving him back his son. Then he can give his son what the both of them (Bobby and Ray Ray) never had, a father. Bobby sees sad expressions on both Jimmy and Ray Ray's faces as everyone lowers their guns. Ray Ray realizes that he and Bobby both know what's best for Jimmy and lets the boy go, in addition to sparing Manchester. Bobby tells Jimmy that eventually the court will let him come home and they will start their lives anew. Touched by Bobby's love for Jimmy, Ray Ray looks on as the Johnsons leave the warehouse.

Balls, a moccasin factory located in the Melbourne suburb of Spotswood, is his next client. Mr. Ball ([[Alwyn Kurts]]), the owner of the company, is affable and treats his employees benevolently. Wallace on a factory tour finds the conditions wanting with shabbiness, old machinery and the workers lackadaisical.  A young worker at Balls, Carey ([[Ben Mendelsohn]]), who is finding his place in the world and life, is asked by Wallace to assist in his review, compiling worker condition and performance information. Carey is reluctant until he learns that Mr. Ball’s daughter Cheryl ([[Rebecca Rigg]]), whom he fancies, is part of the review staff.  Wallace learns that there is an instigator in the midst, his colleague Jerry (John Walton), who leaks the Durmack report, inflating the quantity of sackings as a means to demoralise the union.  Kim ([[Russell Crowe]]), a salesman at Balls who also has his sights set on the boss's daughter, shows his ruthlessness and ulterior motives when he comes to Wallace's home one night with a complete set of the company financial records that detail non-existent profit for years and reveal that Ball has been selling off company assets to keep the outfit afloat.  Wallace realises that whatever productivity improvements have been implemented are not enough to save the company even with an elimination of workers and yet that is his recommendation. Mr. Ball responds, "It’s not just about dollars and cents. It’s about dignity, treating people with respect.”  Wallace's mind set starts to change when his car is vandalised and some Ball workers come to his aid, workers who then start to include him in their off-hours activities. Mr. Ball announces the work force redundancies and Wallace is clearly uncomfortable seeing them, knowing that it was his recommendation that sealed their fate.  The union at Durmack capitulates and management celebrates with a party at which Wallace becomes disenchanted by rash sackings and realises that product diversity can potentially make the company profitable since the skills set is in the workers.  Carey realises he has feelings for his work mate and friend Wendy ([[Toni Collette]]) and together they climb up onto the roof of the factory and hold hands as they look out over Spotswood.

Planning on ending his life by jumping from a bridge, he is approached by the mysterious Sam Bones, an elderly man who offers to jump with him before eventually talking him out of the act. Later, Sam inexplicably appears in Henry's living room, and tells him he will no longer be alone.  Wendy, Henry's [[social worker]], receives a videotape of him informing her of his suicide, which he mailed to her before the botched attempt. Sam promises he can make Henry a star, and brings him to a television studio lot where Henry watches a faceless woman on a screen instruct him to follow his "destiny." Sam gives Henry a plastic baby doll mask and a [[hatchet]] before sending him to make his "debut" at a suburban residence. He breaks into the home intending to murder the homeowner, but becomes transfixed by the television set, and fails to commit the murder. Sam informs him that killing the homeowner will result in his [[saint]]hood, after which Henry returns to the house and hacks the owner to death with the hatchet.  Over the following month, a series of fifteen hatchet murders occur in Los Angeles. Wendy realizes Henry is still alive, and goes to visit him; he tells her of his new "manager," Sam, and she plans to meet with him. Sam, however, is reluctant that Wendy will understand their "mission." When Wendy attempts to locate Sam with the address given to her by Henry, she finds the address does not exist. When she confronts Henry with the notion that Sam is a product of his mind, he becomes enraged. Later, Wendy finds her sister Julie murdered in her apartment.   Henry locks Wendy inside the apartment and goes to confront Sam, whom he blames for committing Julie's murder.

Stay Tuned (film)
 Roy Knable ([[John Ritter]]) is a struggling [[Seattle]] plumbing salesman, former fencing athlete, and couch potato who lives with his neglected wife Helen ([[Pam Dawber]]), a vitamin product senior manager. After a fight (which involved Helen smashing the family television screen with one of Roy's fencing trophies as a wake-up call to reality), Mr. Spike ([[Jeffrey Jones]]) appears at the couples' door, offering them a new high-tech [[satellite dish]] system filled with [[Number of the Beast|666]] channels of programs one cannot view on the four big networks ([[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]). What Roy does not know is that Spike (later referred to as "[[Mephistopheles]] of the [[cathode ray|Cathode Ray]]") is an emissary from [[hell]] who wants to boost the influx of souls by arranging for TV junkies to be killed in the most gruesome and ironic situations imaginable. The 'candidates' are sucked into a hellish television world, called Hellevision, and put through a gauntlet where they must survive a number of satirical versions of sitcoms and movies. If they can survive for 24 hours, they are free to go, but if they get killed, then their souls will become the property of [[Satan]] (the latter usually happens).  The dish eventually sucks Roy and Helen into this warped world. They are pursued by Spike, who enters some shows, along with the Knables, to halt their advance. Roy and Spike continue to fight throughout several shows, even in a cloak-and-dagger scenario where Roy displays his long-buried talent as a fencer. Through tenacity and sheer luck, the Knables keep surviving, and their young son Darryl ([[David Tom]]) recognizes his parents fighting for their lives on the TV set. His older sister Diane ([[Heather McComb]]) and he are able to provide important assistance from the real world. This infuriates Spike to the point that he makes good on Roy's contract, releasing him, but not Helen, as she was not in the system under contract.  Roy re-enters the system to save Helen, bringing his own remote control with him, allowing them to control their journey. After being pursued by Spike through several more channels, Roy finally confronts his enemy in a [[Salt-N-Pepa]] music video, manages to get a hold of Spike's remote, and uses it to save Helen from being run over by a train in a Western movie. By pressing the "off" button on the remote, they are evicted from the TV set moments before it sucks their neighbor's abusive [[Rottweiler]] into the TV and it destroys itself, leaving the Rottweiler trapped in the TV world forever. In the end, Spike gets eliminated by the Rottweiler on the command of Crowley ([[Eugene Levy]]), a vengeful employee he banished to the system earlier, and is then succeeded in his executive position by Pierce ([[Erik King]]), a younger upstart employee. Roy, who has learned a valuable lesson after his adventure, has dramatically cut back on his TV viewing, quit his job as a plumbing salesman, and opened his own fencing school and advised one of his students that watching too much TV can get you into trouble.

One day while her husband is conversing to Wang Shantang, the head of the community, a miscommunication ensues. The leader feels insulted and beats Qinglai, kicking him so severely in the groin that he must see a doctor and remain absent from work.  Qiu Ju goes to the local police office and complains. The policeman makes the village chief pay 200 yuan to Qinglai. When Qiu Ju goes to the headman, he insultingly throws the 200 yuan notes onto the ground and refuses to apologize. Qiu Ju then goes to the provincial capital accompanied by her husbands' younger sister, Meizi. By luck the two women find lodging at a cheap hotel. The two women meet the district police chief and he promises them that their case will be reviewed.  The new verdict from the district police is that this time the village headman must pay 250 yuan. He still refuses to apologize and so Qiu Ju goes back to the big city and finds a lawyer who takes the case and files suit under a new law.  The case is judged by the court as having been correctly resolved by the district, the fine remains at 250 yuan, Qiu Ju is unhappy but all she can do is make yet another appeal to an even higher level of police investigation. As part of the suit, officials come to the village and Qiu Ju's husband is X-rayed at the local hospital.  It's now the middle of winter, Qiu Ju goes into labor. When sought help, the headman with a group of local men carries Qiu Ju to the hospital, where she gives birth safely to a healthy baby boy.  A month later the whole village is invited to the "one-month party" for the baby. Qiu Ju and her husband invite the village chief too for his help in saving Qiu Ju's life. But he doesn't come, and the local policeman shows up to tell Qiu Ju that the X-rays revealed her husband had a broken rib. As a result, the village chief is being sent to jail on a fifteen-day-term.  Qiu Ju tries to stop the police from taking the headman away but never even sees the police and the movie ends with Qiu Ju looking anguished. This ending, along with some selfish and anti-community behavior on the part of Qiu Ju and her husband expresses the difficulty of regarding the film as a simple fight against injustice. Rather, it shows the limitations of modern legal approaches in villages where old-style human relations underlie social life.<ref></ref>  
The Stolen Children
 The beginning of the film is set in the housing projects of suburban Milan, where two troubled children and their mother (an immigrant from [[Sicily]]) live. Unmarried and poor, the mother is not able to meet the economic demands of her two children, subjecting her to prostitute her eleven-year-old daughter Rosetta to one of her wealthy friends. It is unclear how long the prostitution has been going on, but it continues until the day the authorities get involved. After the arrest of the mother, the children are destined to be sent to an orphanage in [[Civitavecchia]], [[Rome]]. Antonio, a young police officer, and one of his work partners get hired to escort the children by train. Antonio’s partner bails on him, and gets off at [[Bologna]] for personal reasons, leaving Antonio to complete the task alone.  Immediately, there is a wavering relationship between the three characters, and as the film develops, it only gets worse. Not only does Luciano, Rosetta’s little brother, suffer from asthma, as well as from a speech problem, most likely resulting from the traumatic experience of witnessing his sister being abused, but Rosetta also shows very rebellious characteristics that make it nearly impossible for Antonio to take control. When they arrive in Rome, at the institute for the children, the head person tells Antonio that the children cannot stay because Rosetta’s medical record is missing. This is most likely an excuse because they are afraid that she will corrupt the other children. Antonio has no choice but to continue his work instead of going to his higher-ups, since he still has to cover for his colleague who is no longer on the case. Antonio decides to bring the children to another institute in [[Gela]], Sicily.  The children spend one day at Antonio’s sister’s home in [[Calabria]], where they celebrate the [[First Communion]] of a family member. Antonio tells his family members that the children are the children of one of his superiors. There, Antonio and Rosetta play and socialize with other kids their age, and are able to forget about their difficult situation. This distraction, however, is promptly cut short by one of the invited guests at the party, Mrs. Papaelo who recognizes Rosetta from a photo in the newspaper about the case of the young girl’s prostitution, and exclaims it to everyone. Rosetta, incredibly humiliated and ashamed, runs out of the house, and Antonio consequently follows, in a moment where the relationship between the characters finally begins to flourish. Antonio develops a sense of compassion for the children, whereas at first, it was merely a duty he had to complete.  Antonio decides to immediately leave the house, taking the children to their next location, during which they meet two French tourists. At the cathedral of [[Noto]], Sicily, one of the tourists gives Rosetta her camera, which is then snatched from her by a thief. Antonio chases after the thief, and after having caught him, arrests him and takes him to the police station. Because of this, Antonio is also found guilty for the robbery of a person. They allow him to continue the trip to the next orphanage, but he will suffer the consequences upon his return. Having nearly reached their final destination, Antonio and the children all fall asleep in the car. The children wake up at early dawn, and walk off to the side of the road, where they sit together awaiting something to happen.

The next day Jennifer meets Christine while enrolling Nicky in school. Keith stops by the school and sees them together and panics.  Andy asks family friend Father Ernest Brennan ([[John Ingle]]) to help him discover Keith's past. While cooking dinner for Father Brennan, Christine asks Keith if he knows Jennifer, but he denies it. Christine grows more suspicious since she knows Jennifer is renting Keith's cottage.  Andy and Father Brennan sneak Keith's fork off the dinner table, to have the fingerprints analyzed. Realizing Brennan is up to something, Keith excuses himself after dinner and follows the priest home. He runs Brennan off the road, beats him to death, and makes it look like a car accident. He also discovers the fork.   When Christine mentions visiting Jennifer, Keith rushes to the plant nursery and calls Jennifer, telling her to meet him. Before going to the nursery Jennifer calls Christine to cancel their meeting, claiming her new boyfriend called with an emergency. When Jennifer arrives, Keith reveals he is married before claiming he needs her out of the way. Keith knocks her unconscious and prepares to kill her by feeding her body into a big wood chipper.  Christine and Andy suddenly appear; Christine has figured out that Keith is Jennifer's new boyfriend and confronts him about the affair. He beats her unconscious when she discovers Jennifer weakly writhing on the ground. As Keith prepares to murder his two lovers, Andy finds the courage to get out of his wheelchair and walk. Keith chases him through the nursery until Andy knocks him into the wood chipper. However, Keith is only hanging on the edge and grabs Andy. Christine gets up and helps Andy get away, leaving Keith to fall into the chipper, killing him.

Strictly Ballroom
 ''Strictly Ballroom'' tells the story of an Australian [[ballroom dance]]r, Scott Hastings ([[Paul Mercurio]]), and his struggle to establish his personal style of dance on his way to win the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Dancing Championship. Scott's steps are not ''strictly ballroom'', and as such are denounced by Australian Federation head Barry Fife. Scott comes from a family with a history of ballroom dancing and has been training since childhood. His mother Shirley teaches ballroom dancing, and his father Doug meekly handles maintenance chores at the dance studio, while secretly spending hours in a back room watching old footage of dance competitions.  After losing a competition to a rival pair, because Scott started dancing his own steps, his dancing partner Liz (Gia Carides) leaves him to team up with Ken, whose partner Pam Short ([[Kerry Shrimpton]]) has broken both her legs in a car accident. With Scott now partnerless and only 3 weeks until the Pan-Pacific Championships, Shirley Hastings and her co-instructor at the studio, Les, embark on a desperate hunt for a new partner for Scott. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to both Shirley and Les, Scott is approached by Fran (Tara Morice), a "beginner" dancer at the studio. The plain and slightly clumsy Fran is initially rebuffed by Scott, but eventually, intrigued by her willingness to dance "his way", along with her feisty attitude, he agrees to audition her and the pair form a new, albeit secret, dance partnership.  The pairing faces its first challenge when Barry Fife, in an effort to pull Scott into line and prevent him from threatening the Dancesport status quo, arranges for Scott to become the new partner of the glamorous Tina Sparkle, an established Champion dancer in her own right whose partner is retiring. When Shirley and Les hear the news, they are overjoyed; Fran, happening upon them exclaiming over their happiness about Scott's new dance partner, misunderstands initially and believes they have discovered that she and Scott have become partners. When she realises the truth, and Scott neither contradicts it nor reveals the truth about their partnership, she leaves, devastated. Scott chases after her and although she is hurt and upset with him, he entices her to dance with him, and her anger is forgotten. However, their dance is witnessed by several onlookers, among them Shirley and Les, who then do everything they can to persuade both Scott and Fran that the best way forward for all concerned is for Scott to forget about Fran and sign on as Tina Sparkle's partner.  Fran reluctantly accedes and returns home. Scott argues with his mother, telling her he won't become Tina's partner. He follows Fran home, where he is discovered and challenged by Fran's Spanish father, who is suspicious of Scott's reason for being with Fran. In an attempt to prove that he and Fran are dance partners and thinking he will impress her family, Scott proposes that they dance a Paso Doble for the assembled company. They begin dancing, but soon stop when their performance is met with jeers and catcalls. Fran's father and grandmother then demonstrate how the Paso Doble should be danced, and offer to teach the youngsters, telling Scott that he must feel the beat of the music in his heart.  Over the next week, Fran and Scott spend hours training and practising, supported by her family, and Scott realises that his ugly duckling beginner dancer has transformed into a skilled and passionate partner, for whom he has strong feelings. However, rumours begin to swirl around the Dancesport community that there are new dance steps about to be revealed/sanctioned. Chairman Fife, suspecting that Scott is in some way responsible, decides that desperate measures are called for and stages a heart to heart with him, telling him that Scott's own father Doug fell into the same trap as he, Scott, is about to, that of turning away from established ballroom traditions to dance in his own style. Fife says that dancing Doug's own way cost Scott's parents their dream, a win of their own at the Pan Pacifics, and that it will break his father's heart if Scott makes the same mistake. Coincidentally Scott's old partner Liz has now been dumped by Ken, and is keen to re-pair with Scott for the Pan Pacifics.  Swayed by Fife's story and not wanting to cause his parents further heartache, Scott abandons Fran, and returns to Liz. The first round of the competition goes well for the pair, with Scott sticking to traditional ballroom steps, and being congratulated by all. Fran has entered the "Beginner" competition, dancing with another beginner girl. After her dance, Scott and Fran run into one another, and she angrily accuses him of caving into pressure and betraying her and all they worked towards, then leaves with her family. Scott's father corners him and confronts him, forcing him to listen to his own version of the events leading to Doug and Shirley not winning the Pan Pacifics so many years previously. The truth is that they never competed because Fife persuaded Shirley that to compete with Doug would be too risky and instead she should dance with Les (subsequently losing anyway), abandoning Doug in the process, much as Scott has just abandoned Fran. Scott sees that he has been manipulated by Fife, and runs after Fran, persuading her once again to forgive him and compete with him as they had planned.  Meanwhile, in another part of the building, Scott's friend Wayne overhears Fife telling old rival Ken, now himself partnered by Tina Sparkle, that Fife has rigged the competition for Ken to win it, irrespective of how anybody else dances. The next round begins, Scott having missed the final call to compete, and Fife believes he has won, until Scott and Fran make their own dramatic entrance and begin dancing, immediately riveting the audience. Fife tries to order them from the floor via the PA system, however Wayne disconnects the power to it.  Desperate to stop Scott and Fran's performance, Fife then tries to turn off the music, but Scott's sister Kylie and her partner Luke (from the children's division) interfere until Fife's loyal companion Charm Leachman disconnects the power to the sound system, stopping all dancing. Fife then disqualifies Scott and Fran, but Doug, unwilling to let Fife beat Scott and win again, begins clapping out a beat to enable Scott and Fran to continue dancing. He is joined, first by Fran's family, then by other members of the audience, as Scott and Fran begin dancing again, drawing cheers from the crowd and tears of joy from Doug. Finally Liz, having had a change of heart, turns on Barry and Leachman and restores the music. Scott and Fran's spirited dancing, as well as their defiance of Fife, brings down the house. Doug asks Shirley to dance with him and the whole audience joins them on the floor. As the performance finishes, Scott and Fran kiss, the competition forgotten.  
A Stranger Among Us
 Hardened [[New York City]] homicide detective Emily Eden ([[Melanie Griffith]]), daughter of a divorced former cop, and her partner Nick ([[Jamey Sheridan]]) attempt to arrest two drug dealers. However, Nick is stabbed by one of the dealers, whom Emily wounds instead of alerting assistance at first. As a result, her superior Lt. Oliver ([[David Margulies]]) temporarily takes away her gun. After Nick is hospitalized, eventually heading to recovery, while the dealers have been apprehended, Emily goes undercover to investigate the murder of a [[Hasidic]] [[diamond cutting|diamond-cutter]] named Yaakov Klausman ([[Jake Weber]]). She questions the family of the Hasidic [[rebbe]] ([[Lee Richardson (actor)|Lee Richardson]]), an elderly [[Holocaust]] survivor who is revered for his wisdom and compassion toward his fellow Jews. He says to her, "You and I have something in common: We are both intimately familiar with [[evil]]. It does something to your [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]."  While living with the rebbe's family, Emily changes her appearance and takes a liking to his son, Ariel ([[Eric Thal]]), a young man who works as a diamond-cutter but teaches in the [[yeshiva]] and is expected to follow his father as the next rebbe. In addition to keeping all [[613 Mitzvot]], he is waiting for his intended, or [[bashert|basherte]], the daughter of a [[Paris]] rebbe whom he has not yet actually met. They are the subjects of an arranged marriage, but he believes that she is his [[soul mate]], chosen by God. He is also studying the [[Kabbalah]], which is regarded as rather daring for a man under 40. Its discussion of sexual intimacy is restrained but specific, as well as a metaphor for the relationship between Man and God.  Emily finds out that the "inside man" in the murder plot is the rebbe's adopted daughter Mara ([[Tracy Pollan]]), who had been living a disorderly life until Yaakov introduced her to the rebbe. Afterwards, she joined the community as a repentant ''[[baal teshuva|baalat tshuva]],'' "one who has returned," until a person from her past approached her and she let him into the Diamond Center to steal diamonds worth about $750,000 and kill Yaakov.  Shortly after, Emily saves the rebbe's daughter Leah ([[Mia Sara]]) from being scammed by the Baldessari brothers Anthony ([[James Gandolfini]]) and Christopher ([[Chris Latta]]), who claim to be Yaakov's killers. Emily instructs her second partner Levine ([[John Pankow]]) to alert assistance and arrests the Baldessaris, but the Baldessaris manage to escape. In the ensuing chase, Levine is injured, while Emily fatally shoots the Baldessaris. Before succumbing to his wounds, Anthony admits to Emily that he and Christopher were not responsible for Yaakov's death.  Having solved the case such as Mara now an accessory to murder, Emily rejects Nick's proposal, secretly romances Ariel to overcome her personal problems, and returns to the rebbe's home with him, but finds that Mara has taken Leah hostage. After Emily attempts to negotiate, Mara knocks her out, and Ariel kills Mara with Emily's revolver, avenging Yaakov. Ariel comments that sometimes an evil deed has a partially good result. Emily is hospitalized for an examination, while the rebbe and his family bid her farewell. Ariel and his basherte Shayna Singer ([[Rena Sofer]]) get married, in which a reformed Emily watches from a distance. Eventually, she returns to work and catches up with an also reformed Levine, who is on leave and invites her on a two-week trip to Aruba. However, she declines and awaits her bashert.  
Straight Talk
  Shirlee Kenyon is a dance instructor living in Arkansas. After she is fired for giving advice to her clients rather than teaching them dance, she attempts to convince her [[common-law husband]] ([[Michael Madsen]]) to move to [[Chicago]] with her. After he declines and then belittles her, she decides to move there without him.  Once she arrives, she stands on a bridge enjoying the view of the city when she accidentally drops a twenty-dollar bill. As she climbs over the rail to retrieve the money, Jack ([[James Woods]]), an investigative journalist, sees her from the office window of the newspaper for which he works, and assumes that she is trying to commit [[suicide]]. He runs out to rescue her, but as he attempts to grab her and "save" her, Shirlee loses her balance, and almost falls into the water below; she loses the money she had been trying to recover. After they recover, and she informs Jack that she had, in fact, not been attempting suicide, but was merely trying to recover a twenty-dollar bill, Jack tries to give her money, saying she must need it more than him if she is willing to risk her life to retrieve it. She refuses and the two part. Shirlee stops into a cafe for breakfast, and strikes up a conversation with another customer, Janice ([[Teri Hatcher]]), who is annoyed at having been stood up by her boyfriend the previous evening. Shirlee tells Janice that he is taking her for granted, and advises her to end the relationship, only to realize that Janice's boyfriend is, in fact, Jack; Jack shows up, and Janice tells him she no longer wants to see him. Jack thanks Shirlee for "wrecking his entire day", as he exits the cafe.  After a series of failed job interviews, a manager at a local radio station ([[Paula Newsome]]) hires her as a switchboard operator, despite her lack of experience, and during her first day, she inadvertently walks into a studio, and is mistaken for the station's new call-in therapist, is put on the air, and begins hesitantly talking with the show's callers. Upon completion of the show, the program director arrives, and fires Shirlee, along with the producer and engineer, who had made the mistake in putting her on the air. However, Shirlee's radio segment becomes in high demand with their audience, prompting the radio station boss, Mr. Perlman, to demand that Shirlee be the new radio personality. Alan finds Shirlee and convince her to do the show offering a $800 per week contract. Shirlee accepts the position, but there is one condition: she must pretend to be a real clinical doctor. She reluctantly accepts and becomes a popular radio figure as "Doctor Shirlee."  Jack suspects something when he realizes the woman who was ready to risk her life for twenty dollars is a doctor. Although his editor disagrees, Jack pursues the story. He begins to date Shirlee, initially in an attempt to get closer to her to uncover her story, but he soon falls in love with her. Shirlee's boyfriend from Arkansas arrives in Chicago to try to get her back, though his attempts fall short, and Shirlee and Jack make love. Afterwards, Jack develops true feelings for her and refuses to publish the story, resigning from his job over the matter. However, Shirlee receives another visit from her ex, who tells her that he just remembered having previously met Jack in Arkansas, and that he was asking a number of questions about her. This leads Shirlee to realize that Jack is, in fact, a reporter, and his interest in her is merely a means to uncovering her story. She storms off, and refuses to take Jack's calls.  As Shirlee's popularity increases, a mishap involving some of her previous advice to one of her callers eventually causes her to confess the truth to everyone on air that she is not a real doctor, and she then leaves the show. All of her listeners call in and want her back, regardless of her credentials. Someone calls the show and tells everyone listening to honk their horns at midnight if they want Shirlee back. Jack tracks Shirlee down on the same bridge where they had first met and convinces her to take him back. When she hears the horns, Jack tells her that they are for her. She eventually goes back to the radio show, but insists that she just wants to be called "Shirlee."

The inspector RadhaKrishna ([[Achyuth]]) informs his aunt ([[Jayanthi (actress)|Jayanthi]]), who teaches music in his native village, of this and the past of Anantha Sharma is narrated through flashback.  ; Flashback begins Anantha Rama Sharma is a widely respected Carnatic singer with a big ego. This is established when he rejects the ''[[Padma Shri]]'' bestowed upon him by the Government of India, as he believes that the other awardees are not worthy to be mentioned alongside him.  Gangadhar ([[Master Manjunath]]) lives in the same village. He rejects the society's norms (taking music classes and going to school) and spends his time sitting by the riverside. The river inspires him to sing many songs in different tunes. His music teacher, also the policeman's aunt, recognizes his talent and tries to nurture it. His school teacher (the music teacher's brother) is also fond of Gangadhar.

So he asks Gangadhar to stay in his house and learn music as one must be well-experienced to sing on stage. Anantha Sharma goes to the extent of copying one of Gangadhar's tunes and singing it on stage to win back his glory. But Gangadhar and Ananta's wife find this out. He now feels guilty and defends himself by saying that he did it as he was afraid this child would destroy his name and fame.  In this emotional moment, he suffers a heart-attack. To show his gratitude towards his adopted mother, Gangadhar kills himself so that there is no competition for Anantha Sharma. The incident shocks the villagers and they call Anantha Sharma a murderer. To escape their wrath and insults, he runs away and becomes a recluse. ;Flashback ends  Ananta Sharma is still unconscious while in the police station. When he awakes, he finds himself in the house of Gangadhar's music teacher. The music teacher's husband tells him that they have forgiven him and asks him to return to his house. At his house, he finds his wife giving music classes (an institute named 'Gangadhar Music Academy') for young children.  He sits down amongst the children learning the music basics from his wife.

Tahader Katha
  Shibnath (played by [[Mithun Chakraborty]]) is a freedom fighter in the [[Indian independence movement]]. The film starts when, following the [[independence of India]], Shibnath is released from prison after eleven years of incarceration for murdering a [[United Kingdom|British]] officer. Shibnath spent a part of his term in the prison asylum.  In the journey back home, Shibnath is accompanied by one of his comrades, Bipin Gupta (played by [[Dipankar De]])—now a successful businessman and an aspiring politician in independent [[India]]. Shibnath experiences the aftermath of [[Partition of India]] (India was partitioned in Republic of India and [[Pakistan]] in 1947, at the time of independence), with his own family becoming refugees, and his ancestral village now belonging to a separate nation of [[East Pakistan]]. With the help of Bipin Gupta, his family now resides in rural [[West Bengal]]. Once cutting a formidable figure as a virile and courageous freedom fighter crusading for a united and independent Bengal to drive away the British, Shibnath now stands in stark contrast: a fragile, fragmented shell of his former self as he awkwardly hobbles along an unpaved road through the countryside, stopping frequently along the way to relieve himself in the woods, unable to control even his own bodily functions (undoubtedly the autonomic legacy resulting from years of physical torture and inhumane treatment that he sustained while in police custody).  Shibnath's wife, Hemangini, urges him to make ally with Bipin who is willing to capitalize on Shibnath's legendary reputation for patriotism, by asking to accompany him in electoral campaigns. In exchange, Bipin is ready to arrange Shibnath the job of a school master. However, Shibnath remains disillusioned and mystified by the life that now lies before him away from his beloved—and irretrievably lost—homeland. Unable to abandon his crushed idealism and put his devastated past behind him, he withdraws further away from family and former colleagues, retreating into the tenuous company of his own fractured and haunted memories.

Tetsuo II: Body Hammer
 The film opens with a man being shot by Yatsu - known as "The Metal Fetishist" or "The Guy" in this movie - who fires the shot from his index finger, holding his hand like a gun.  Taniguchi Tomoo is discussing his past with his wife, since he does not have any memories before his adoption at eight years old. He is almost killed  when two cyborg skinheads try to kidnap his son, Minori. He is forced to take an injection by one of the skinheads. Frightened by the encounter, he starts working out. Unsuccessful lifting even the lightest of weights at first, he suddenly is capable of enormous feats of strength. Later, he gets an anonymous call asking how his training went. The caller informs Taniguchi that he has kidnapped Minori by entering through the building's back door. Taniguchi chases the kidnappers to a roof where he again finds himself hanging on the edge, close to death. However, this time he manages to pull himself up, only to be told the skinhead already threw his son off the roof.  Enraged by this, Taniguchi transforms and grows a gun from his arm. He shoots the skinhead who, having lied about dropping Minori, holds the son in front of him, causing Taniguchi to kill his own son. The skinhead escapes, leaving behind a distraught Taniguchi who discovers his wife saw everything.  The skinheads arrive at their hideout where their accomplices work out lifting enormous weights. They meet a Mad Scientist who asks them what kind of specimen they picked for the injection, revealing that Taniguchi's injection is part of an experiment. Later, Taniguchi is kidnapped by the skinheads and experimented on by the Mad Scientist who manipulates Taniguchi's memories, furthering his change from man to machine. It is revealed that the Mad Scientist works with Yatsu who - after ordering Taniguchi's death - informs the Mad Scientist that his goal is only destruction and that every skinhead get an injection.  After Taniguchi's escape, a skinhead injects himself and rapidly transforms, since his will to kill is much greater. During the escape, Taniguchi and the skinhead find they both have the ability to transform back into their human forms. The two face off in an abandoned factory and the skinhead tells Taniguchi that they all want to be made into gods by Yatsu.  Back at home, Taniguchi's wife, Kana, discovers that Taniguchi's injection was actually blocked by his pocket organizer. So Taniguchi has the ability to transform into a machine under his own will. His wife is visibly scared of her husband. She leaves in a hurry, only to also be kidnapped on the street. Taniguchi pursues the car on a bicycle, transforming and eventually catching up. Still, the skinheads manage to escape. Kana meets Yatsu who tells her about her husband, who apparently has possessed incredible power all along, but chose to not use it unless he's pushed. The last time he used the power - before his eighth birthday - not only did he kill all the children who bullied him, but also destroyed those he loved.  Taniguchi finds where Kana is held and ignores threats of the skinheads killing her. Yatsu talks to Taniguchi, then seemingly kills Kana. Taniguchi has had no mercy and a hostage meant nothing to him. Still, Kana's death pushes Taniguchi completely over the edge and he fully transforms. In the fight between Yatsu and Taniguchi, Yatsu tries to rust Taniguchi to death, like in the first movie. After Taniguchi has seemingly won, Yatsu shoots a cable into Taniguchi, causing further transformations.  During this, Taniguchi learns that his father was creating the perfect human weapon, first training his sons - Tomoo and Yatsu - with guns, then making the guns part of them. Tomoo leaves before killing a dog, while his brother kills the animal. The boys also witness their father killing their mother in a bizarre sex ritual involving the woman sucking on a gun. Tomoo loses his memory after witnessing the death of both his mother and killing his father. This makes him realize the beauty of destruction and both Tomoo and Yatsu merge into a humongous creature. Tomoo begs Kana to inject him with the gun that will make him rust to death, but she refuses to harm him. The Tomoo/Yatsu creature merges with the remaining skinheads and they turn into a giant, tank-like machine rolling through the city.  The final shots of the movie show Kana, Tomoo, and Minori walking through the ruins of what was once a city, with her remarking how peaceful the place has become.

Thevar Magan

Much to his father’s annoyance, he brings his westernized girlfriend Bhanu ([[Gautami]]) with him to meet his family. Periya Thevar is deeply offended since it is a tradition that the family elders choose the youngster's spouses. To make things worse, Sakthivel reveals his plans on opening a chain of restaurants in [[Chennai]] which saddens Periya Thevar as he wanted his son to help the villagers improve their lifestyle with his level of education.  Periya Thevar is a well-respected village chief. His younger half-brother Chinna Thevar ([[Kaka Radhakrishnan]]) and nephew Maya Thevar ([[Nassar]]) hold a huge grudge against him over a falling-out. The entire village suffers from a spillover of this longstanding family feud as most of the village and its surrounding areas that fall within its jurisdiction is divided between the brothers. Since Maya Thevar always tries to one-up Periya Thevar, it puts them at loggerheads with each other.  Sakthivel spends time in the village with his girlfriend by revisiting his childhood memories. They come across an old temple which has been closed off on Maya Thevar’s instructions. He insists on entering, and his friend and servant Esaki ([[Vadivelu]]) breaks open the lock for them to look around. Maya Thevar hears of this, and a brutal riot is started between the two village factions. Periya Thevar, in order to quell the situation, contemplates on apologizing to his opponents. Sakthivel feels it should be him or Esaki who should apologize. When Saktivelu asks for Esaki, he learns that Maya Thevar has cut off Esaki’s hand as punishment for opening the temple. To prevent further escalation of the situation, Sakthivel, with permission from Periya Thevar, enlists the help of his friends in the government, and opens the temple for all legally. Slighted by this, Maya Thevar hires goons to break a dam protecting a part of the village faction that supports Periya Thevar. Although one of the villagers spots one of the goons near the dam, he does not think much of it.  The dam is damaged by explosives used by the goons which result in flooding of half the village. This results in numerous deaths including infants which deeply saddens Sakthivel. He spots the goon who placed the explosives again in the village and gives chase. After capturing, he hands the goon over to the police but the goon does not speak of Maya Thevar's involvement due to fear for his own family's safety.  Later Maya Thevar closes a portion of his land, preventing the public from reaching the main road easily. Sakthivel and Periya Thevar invite them for talks at village Panchayat to resolve the standoff due the riots and flooding. In the village [[panchayat]],</ref>}} accusations fly from both sides. With no evidence backing up the truth, Maya Thevar accuses Periya Thevar of orchestrating various attacks on his brother's family. Disrespected and broken, Periya Thevar returns to his home and passes away due to a [[heart attack]] later that night. Sakthivel takes over his father’s duties as the head of the village.  As time passes, this incident dies down. The villagers express concern to Sakthivel about going around the piece of land belonging to Maya Thevar’s side of the village every day to work on their farm which causes a much longer travelling time. Sakthivel reasons with the landowner Paramasivam (Kallapart Natarajan) to open it up for all villagers to pass so that their long commute is shortened. Although understanding and willing, Paramasivam, who is actually Maya Thevar's maternal uncle, is afraid of Maya Thevar’s backlash, especially since he has a daughter Panchavarnam ([[Revathi]]). Saktivelu assuages his fear by arranging the marriage between a well-to-do person from his village to Panchavarnam. Everybody involved happily agrees and Paramasivam opens up the land for everyone.  On the day of the wedding, the groom runs away, fearing Maya Thevar. Paramasivam and Panchavarnam are distraught over this, claiming it is a huge disrespect to his family. He opines that even if someone marries his daughter, they have to live in constant fear. Sakthivel then gets permission from Paramasivam and weds Panchavarnam. Although Sakthivel still has feelings for Bhanumathi and Panchavarnam is very shy, they overcome their awkwardness and move on. Soon, Bhanumathi returns and learns the truth. Although saddened by the turn of events, she understands the situation and leaves. Sakthivel, too, closes the chapter about Bhanumathi and starts his new life with Panchavarnam.  Maya Thevar, agitated by the land opening, plants a bomb during the village festival. This results in deaths on both sides of the village. Both factions of the village, wanting revenge, go after Maya Thevar and his family. Sakthivel protects the innocent family and helps them get away from the villagers. Appreciative of Sakthivel's efforts to protect them, they give away Maya Thevar's hiding location.  Sakthivel goes to meet Maya Thevar and asks him to surrender to the police before the villagers kill him. Maya Thevar’s rabid hatred for Sakthivel makes him reject his offer of help. Maya Thevar, blaming Sakthivel for all his problems, tries to kill him. In the struggle that follows, Sakthivel accidentally [[decapitation|decapitates]] Maya Thevar. Although other villagers are willing to take the blame for Maya Thevar's murder, Sakthivel gives himself up to the police, wanting to put an end to the cycle of violence once and for all.  
Thumbelina (1992 film)

He shows his [[daughter]] the different cracks that have formed over the dam's surface, and though the girl shows no concern, her father is deeply worried that, come spring, newly melted snow will cause the dam to break and flood the meadow where the little people live in flowers. The keeper sends his daughter to warn the little people's prince.  After a long day of walking, the young girl falls asleep inside a tulip. As she sleeps, an old medicine woman discovers her and takes the tulip to town. She sells the tulip to a lonely, childless woman, promising that it will open to reveal a child. The child-less woman agrees and is delighted to find a beautiful girl smaller than her thumb, whom she names "Thumbelina." When Thumbelina awakes, she tries to explain that she is on a quest to find the prince of the little people, but the woman doesn't listen.  At the end of her first day in her new home, Thumbelina goes to bed feeling lost hopeless. Shortly after she falls asleep, a frog captures Thumbelina and takes her away to her [[nymphaeaceae|lily pad]] to marry the frog's son. Thumbelina escapes with the help of two fish, who cut the pad's roots and set it free. Downstream, Thumbelina befriends a swallow. The bird listens to her story but is unable to help, as he himself has lost his flock and needs to find it before the winter. Thumbelina then meets a butterfly who offers to take her to the meadow. However, a [[beetle]] snatches Thumbelina away before she can leave. After being ridiculed by his friends about his ugly new "pet," the beetle leaves the lost Thumbelina on her own once again.  Thumbelina manages to make herself a home for the winter with the help of the Big Bear, who brings her honey and protects her from dangerous animals. After Big Bear's brothers arrive, the three bears make their way to their cave to sleep during the long winter. Starving, Thumbelina searches for food and eventually finds the home of the old mouse Mona, who takes Thumbelina into her home for the remainder of winter. In exchange, Thumbelina helps Mona with the housework and cooking. Unbeknownst to Thumbelina, Mona has sold Thumbelina to the ugly Mr. Mole in exchange for food. When Mr. Mole arrives, Mona tells Thumbelina that if she marries him, Mr. Mole will take her to the meadow of the tulips. Seeing no other option, Thumbelina accepts. Mr. Mole shows Thumbelina what will become her new home, a dark tunnel under the soil. There, Thumbelina is shocked to find the dead body of her friend the swallow. At night, Thumbelina brings the swallow a blanket. To her surprise, the swallow opens his eyes and is glad to see the girl once again. Thumbelina nurses the swallow back to health as spring and her wedding date draw closer. The swallow offers to fly Thumbelina away, but she refuses feeling that she cannot betray Mona, who had been so kind to her when she had nearly frozen to death.  On the day of her wedding, Thumbelina is heartbroken when she realizes that she has failed at the important task given to her by her father and fears for the lives of all of the little people. The swallow, who had left once he had recovered, returns to Thumbelina with the news that he has found the meadow of the tulips. Thumbelina discovers Mona's wicked plan. Feeling cheated, Thumbelina climbs on the back of the swallow and flies off to get the prince. Thumbelina, the prince, and his men, riding upon the swallow and his newly found flock, arrive at the dam where Thumbelina's father waits desperately. Delighted to see his daughter again, the keeper of the dam embraces her and watches as the soldiers fix the dam's cracks. Once the meadow of the tulips is safe, the prince proposes marriage to Thumbelina. Thumbelina accepts and becomes the princess of the land to the cheers of the little people.

 The young [[D'Artagnan]] wants to be a [[musketeer]] and for this he travels the long way to the city of [[Paris]] in [[France]], where he will enter the same academy for musketeers that his father had attended. On his way to Paris, however, he meets up with Monsieur [[Comte de Rochefort|Rochefort]]. D'Artagnan does not know that his rivalry with Monsieur Rochefort will get him involved in a battle against the evil [[Conspiracy (political)|plot]] thought up by [[Cardinal Richelieu]] against the [[king]] and [[Queen consort|queen]] of France. When Cardinal Richelieu discovers that the queen had sent valuable [[diamond]]s to the [[Duke of Buckingham]] in [[England]], a country enemy of France, the cardinal uses the information to [[blackmail]] the queen and create a difficult situation between her and [[Louis XIII of France|King Louis]], who now believes his wife to be in love with the Duke of Buckingham. Nobody knows that the diamonds are in possession of an old woman, [[Milady De Winter|Milady]], who had stolen the diamonds from the duke and had brought them for Rochefort so that they would be nowhere to be found; Rochefort allows her to hold on to the diamonds in order to ensure this.  Shortly after entering the academy of musketeers, D'Artagnan meets three of the finest among them, [[Porthos]], [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]] and [[Aramis]]. Though their first meeting had not gone well and had led to the challenging of several [[duel]]s, the four of them become fine friends shortly after, since all four fight against the Cardinal's [[soldier]]s. When searching for lodging in Paris, D'Artagnan meets the lovely [[Constance Bonacieux]], a good friend of the queen. Cardinal Richelieu orders all of the queen's closest friends to be arrested so that no one will be able to defend her once King Louis decides to have her beheaded. D'Artagnan defends Constance when a group of soldiers try to insolently have her arrested and then takes her to the safety of the queen. Constance trusts the queen and when she learns of the awful accusation that's been laid upon her, the woman asks of D'Artagnan to travel to England and fetch the Duke of Buckingham, the only one who may now save the queen. D'Artagnan, now in love with Constance but not fully trusting of the queen, gathers his three friends, the three musketeers and all of them travel to England together. There, they meet the Duke of Buckingham, as well as Milady, who confesses the [[crime]] of [[theft]] she is committed and attempts to murder the duke, believing he is in love with the queen of France instead of her.  The five of them, D'Artagnan, the duke and the three musketeers, return to France just as the queen is being led to the guillotine. King Louis begs his wife to lie to him, to tell him that she did not send the diamonds out for the Duke of Buckingham, even if she did, but the queen refuses.  When the cardinal and the soldiers discover the presence of the duke, they fear for the safety of the king and attack the five men. As D'Artagnan comes close to finishing off Rochefort, the Cardinal calls everyone to stop, for the King himself does not wish Rochefort to be harmed. The Duke of Buckingham then bows before King Louis and explains to him that he is in reality the brother of his wife, not the lover. The queen explains that she and her brother had been separated and that she had been sent to France. She had sent the diamonds to the Duke to prevent him from being locked up when he was left almost penniless and when difficulties had begun between France and England. She had had to remain silent, for she could not reveal she was sister to the duke of a land enemy to her own. King Louie then apologizes to his wife for doubting her, befriends the Duke of Buckingham, declares peace between their two countries and finally declares D'Artagnian as an official musketeer in his service.

Ray is partnered with agent Frank "Cooch" Coutelle, who has diligently worked on the probe looking to apprehend a prime suspect: Aboriginal Rights Movement radical Jimmy Looks Twice.

To Grandmother's House We Go
 Twin sisters Sarah and Julie ([[Mary-Kate Olsen]] and [[Ashley Olsen]]) are two naughty but sweet children who drive their work-obsessed divorced mother, Rhonda ([[Cynthia Geary]]), up the wall. They overhear her saying that they are a "handful" and she needs a "vacation". Deciding to give Rhonda what she wants by heading off to their great grandmother's house for Christmas, the girls pack up their bags and hop on their bicycles. But there's a problem; they aren't allowed to cross the street on their own. The city bus pulls up, and they sneak on through the back door. While riding the bus, an elderly lady informs them that the bus only goes back and forth between Uptown and Downtown, and that Edgemont (where Grandma lives) is actually several hours away.  After getting off the bus downtown, they spot Eddie ([[J. Eddie Peck]]) (a delivery man who has a crush on their mom) and his truck. They sneak into its back thinking that he will lead them to their great-grandmother's, and only reveal themselves to him because Sarah desperately has to go to the bathroom. He doesn't like kids, but eventually starts to enjoy the girls' company after he figures out that he gets large tips when they deliver packages with him. He even buys them ice cream, as well as a lottery ticket with the numbers of their birth date (6-13-19-8-7). Meanwhile, the babysitter has noticed that the girls were missing and inform Rhonda about it, who in concerns of the news frantically closes her opened 24/7 store, and rushes home to inspect the place and call the police. Just as she is reporting it to the police, Eddie calls her and gives her the good news that he has the girls and how they got there. She agrees to come pick them up, but he agrees to keep them and watch over them promising to bring them back at the end of the day when he has finished, while having the girls believe that he will take them to Grandma's if they help out.  After the day's deliveries are finished, of course against their will, he brings them home even revealing to them that adults will say anything to get kids to go along. He manages to make it back home telling the girls to go to the back to get their suitcases where he will meet them there. He manages to step out of his truck, only to be attacked by two robbers who steal his truck (with the girls still inside). When the robbers, Harvey and Shirley ([[Jerry Van Dyke]] and [[Rhea Perlman]]), discover them and why they are there, they decide they can make some money by kidnapping them for ransom. Shirley makes a phone call to Rhonda, asking for a ransom which she calls a "reward" of $10,000 in cash. She also forced Rhonda not to inform the police about it, or else they will permanently disappear with the girls. She tells her that they will make the trade at the ice rink in Edgemont, and that she is to wear a red hat.  Meanwhile, Harvey has begun to like the girls and when he asks Shirley why they never had kids, she replies that it's because they're too busy being criminals, though he agrees that it's just their job rather than a mission, which is how Shirley views it. Eddie and Rhonda reluctantly agree to raise the money for ransom through opening up and selling merchandise which Eddie is supposed to be delivering. However, they succeed as planned and manage to make it close to the threshold of what they're supposed to raise. Eddie gives Rhonda a red cowgirl cat from his stack of cowboy wannabes. They succeed as planned, and however, the pawnshops start noticing the stolen merchandise and reporting to Detective Gremp ([[Stuart Margolin]]) and his officials, writing out a warrant for their arrest, mistaking them for the bandits.  Through managing to make it to the skating rink in Edgemont, through many pros and cons between Eddie and Rhonda and the bandits and how the girls run off again over being upset about the truth that Harvey reveals to them, and through runaway horses disguised as reindeer which Santa left after they had a visit with him, and with the help of Eddie's intervention and resilience, Sarah and Julie eventually get to their great-grandmother's house, and then Eddie and Rhonda (who by this time has learned that it was because of her saying she wanted a vacation that the girls ran away, and apologizes to the girls for being upset and making them think like that) get together after he saves the girls. Just as everything becomes okay, and Eddie and Rhonda share a hug, Detective Gremp and one of his officials burst in and handcuff them. They try to reveal to Gremp the truth about what was going on in their side of the story and what Eddie had planned to do to pay it all back, but he still assumes that they are the real bandits because of the whole ransom deal. Harvey's heart goes out to them as Shirley is trying to force them to get away while they have the chance, and thanks to his conscience kicking in, he intervenes and causes the truth to be revealed. They get handcuffed and sent away, with Harvey telling Shirley that if they ever get out, he promises to make her proud by being the worst convict possible.  Through enough persuasion, Gremp agrees to let Eddie, Rhonda and the girls go all the back to the city with him, so Eddie can be back in time to be able to have a chance at winning the lotto of 1.3 million dollars on a TV show. He promises to split what he wins between Rhonda and the girls, and has the girls spin the prize wheel for him. Through pure luck, he wins the jackpot. Afterwards, they give all the people their parcels back, and everybody is happy spending Christmas together.  
The Tigress (1992 film)
 In a sordid night club in 1920s Berlin, the penniless con man Andrei catches the eye of the fiery whore Pauline, known as The Tigress. Underworld boss Harry considers her his property, but she spends the next two days in bed with Andrei. To escape Harry's revenge, the two disappear to neighbouring Czechoslovakia and book into a hotel in the resort of Carlsbad. They have the jewels Pauline has accumulated during her career, which are used to buy smart clothes and attend smart evenings in the casino. Andrei promotes himself to a baron and introduces Pauline as a film star, stressing that they are not married (and privately stressing to Pauline that this is all a business venture and he is not going to fall in love with her). She soon acquires admirers, an Austrian count and a Texan oil man. Playing them off against each other, she eventually succumbs to the Texan, who is by far the richer. Andrei's plan is to burst in and challenge the Texan to a duel, confident that the man would rather pay a large amount of money than lose his life, but on barging into the room he discovers Pauline has vanished. She has been tipped off by a friend in Berlin that Harry is on a train to find her. Unaware of this, Andrei goes to the station and is spotted by Harry, who starts shooting at him. Jumping onto a moving train, Andrei is robbed of all he has by some villains and thrown out beside a road. Along the road comes Pauline, looking for him because she has been in love with him all along.  
Tito and Me
 The movie is set in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|communist-ruled Yugoslavia]] during the 1950s. Zoran is a slightly overweight 10-year-old living in an overcrowded home that his parents share with his grandmother, aunt and uncle. In the early communist era of Yugoslavia, many homes were taken away from their owners in the Land Reform programs.  Zoran's family is opposed to [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s rule, while little Zoran sees Tito as his personal hero. He's learned in school that Tito is the greatest man ever. One day, Zoran writes a composition called "Why I Like the President", which is judged the best of those submitted by Belgrade's schoolchildren. He wins a week's camping trip with other children of families favored by the regime, the trip's highlight being a reception at Tito's palace...  
Timescape (1992 film)
  Haunted by the death of his wife, Ben Wilson ([[Jeff Daniels]]), has recently returned to his hometown and purchased an old [[guest house (lodging)|guest house]] on the outskirts of town, which he is renovating with his young daughter Hillary ([[Ariana Richards]]). When local bus driver Oscar arrives with a tour group from "South California", the group's leader insists on renting out the rooms at the guest house, pointedly rejecting Ben's suggestion that they could stay at his friends' large hotel in the middle of town. Ben soon begins to note their peculiar behaviour, manner and dress. Oscar points out the fact that, while they purport to be tourists, they do not carry cameras or take photographs. Shortly after they settle into their rooms, another stranger, Quish (David Wells), arrives to join them, and Ben notices the odd fact that Quish's clothes have a fine covering of ash.  Ben's suspicions are heightened by events of the following day, when Quish has a minor accident while walking through the town. Ben helps him, in the process recovering Quish's dropped American passport, which he discovers has been stamped with locations inside the United States that are dated many decades apart. The local doctor then shows Ben an X-ray of Quish's head, which reveals that there is a mysterious object embedded in his skull. As they leave the surgery, Wilson confronts Quish, having deduced that the stamps correspond to the times and places of famous disasters, including the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], the crash of the ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'' and the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]] volcanic eruption (hence the ash on Quish's clothing). Unnerved, Quish will only respond by warning Wilson to leave town immediately and not return until he is sure it is safe.  Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Ben, his vengeful father-in-law, Judge Caldwell ([[George Murdock (actor)|George Murdock]]) &mdash; who blames Ben for his daughter's death &mdash; has secretly arranged to have Hilary taken away from Ben on the grounds that he is an unfit parent. When Ben returns home, he finds Hilary gone and confronts the judge but is threatened with arrest; defeated, he goes to stay at the local hotel. There he is visited by Reeve, one of the Tourists, who confirms his suspicions about their true nature: they are time-travellers from the future who visit the scenes of famous disasters as part of a "Grand Tour" of the past. She then gives Ben a euphoric substance and seduces him, leaving him unconscious.  Late that night, Ben is found and revived by Oscar. They return to the guest house to find out why the Tourists have come, but minutes later the town is struck by a large meteorite, resulting in almost total destruction. Ben races to the judge's shattered home, where he finds Hilary alive; heading back into town he finds the hotel destroyed and his friends dead, while the Tourists stroll through the devastation with an air of detached fascination. Ben and Hilary work through the night helping the survivors, who are taken to Hilary's local school, which has become the local disaster relief centre.  When Ben and Oscar return to the guest house the next day, Ben is alarmed to discover that, although the Tourists have left the house, their luggage is still there. He and Oscar track them to an abandoned factory outside the town, where Ben realises that they are awaiting a second disaster which is about to strike the school. The tourists try to detain him, but he evades them and races to the scene, hoping to save Hilary. Meanwhile, maintenance workers accidentally damage a gas pipeline in the boiler room of the school, and just as Ben arrives, a hurricane lamp in the gymnasium ignites the leaking gas, destroying the school in a massive blast and killing most of the people inside, including Hilary and Quish, who has followed Ben to the building.  Ben regains consciousness to find that he has been taken prisoner by the Tourists and that an official from their time, the Undersecretary ([[Robert Colbert]]), has arrived to investigate and try to remedy the disruptions to Ben's "Timescape". He explains that his people have discovered that time is more resilient than they had first believed. However, because of the changes enacted by Ben and the Tourists, all time excursions have been suspended pending a full investigation. Just before they depart, Ben attacks Reeve for her lack of humanity, but as she leaves she embraces him, secretly slipping Quish's passport into his hand.  On examining the passport Ben discovers that it conceals one of the Tourists' time travel devices. He eventually makes it work and returns to the previous evening to try and save his daughter and the townsfolk from the disaster. Realising that Hilary is then at her grandfather's house, he tries to sneak her away, but he is caught and thrown into jail, which is itself soon to be destroyed. However he convinces the deputy to allow him his one phone call and manages to contact his pre-existing self at the hotel, just as that self is meeting with Reeve. This alternate self helps the 'original' Ben to escape from the jail and together they manage to alert and save most of the people by ringing the bells in the old church on the other side of town.  Leaving Hilary with his 'earlier' self, the 'original' Ben walks through the scene of the impact; there he is again confronted by the Undersecretary, who had returned to take Ben back to his proper point in time. He warns Ben not to interfere any further and threatens to alter the past again to eliminate Ben's actions, but Ben challenges him by arguing that if the Undersecretary's assertions were true, his people would have already done so.  In the final scene, we see Hilary taking bookings for the now-completed guest house while Ben reads through old [[love letter]]s from his late wife. When Hilary looks up, Ben has vanished, and as the movie closes Hilary suddenly hears and is drawn towards the sound of someone playing her mother's favourite tune on the piano.

This may be a chance for detective Linda Masterson to work on her first murder case. She is assigned the job and to assist her is another martial arts specialist, Sgt. Tarek Richards. Now they need to find a tiger style master, because the killer obviously uses tiger-style kung fu. Not a simple task, since tiger is a very ancient and rare style.  Sgt.

Toys (film)
 Kenneth Zevo, the owner of the Zevo Toys factory in [[Moscow, Idaho]], is dying. He surprises his assistant, Owen Owens, with his desire that instead of his son Leslie succeeding him, it will be his brother, Leland, who is a [[lieutenant general]] in the US Army. Even Leland is unsure of this, pointing out how Leslie has been apprenticed at the toy factory most of his life. Kenneth agrees Leslie loves toys and his work, but his childlike demeanor would not help him to be a successful business leader. Kenneth had even hired a young woman named Gwen Tyler to work in the factory, hoping she and Leslie would start a relationship that would help Leslie to mature.  Kenneth passes away and Leland reluctantly takes control of the factory. Leland's first thought is to simply allow Leslie and his sister, Alsatia, continue to design new toys and effectively run the factory. However, Leland's interest is piqued when he hears about corporate secrets being leaked, and he hires his son, Patrick, a soldier with covert military expertise, to manage security. From Patrick, Leland gets the idea of building war toys in the factory, even though Leslie points out Zevo Toys has never made war toys due to Kenneth's dislike of war in general. Meanwhile, Leslie finally notices Gwen, and they start dating.  Leland offers to drop the idea of Zevo Toys making war toys, but asks Leslie if he can partition off a small amount of the factory to develop toys of his own. He asks Leslie to stay out of the area for fear that his toys may not be good enough. Unknown to Leslie, Leland is using the space to develop miniature war machines that can be controlled remotely, aspiring to sell these to the military. However, the military leaders refuse to buy into his plan, and Leland, becoming unhinged by their refusal, moves ahead with his plan independently. He takes over more and more of the factory space and increases security on these areas. When Leslie sees children being led into one of Leland's secure areas, he finds a way to sneak into the space. Inside, he discovers Leland training the children to operate the miniature war machines with arcade-like interfaces so the children would not be aware they are actually operating real war equipment. Leslie flees before he is discovered, barely escaping the "Sea Swine" amphibious drone guarding an exit, and makes his way to Gwen's house to reveal what he saw. Leslie is aware that Leland has seen his actions through spy toys monitoring the area, and prepares to defend his parts of the factory, and promotes himself to general of his own army. Patrick learns Leland lied about the death of his mother and quits to warn Leslie.  Leslie, Alsatia, Patrick, Gwen, and Owen go to the factory to fight against Leland, using the Zevo toys against Leland's war machines. Leslie manages to get to Leland, and during the fight between Leslie and Leland on a prop airplane, Leland’s helicopter attempts to hit Leslie with a missile, misses and hits Leland's control panel, which shuts down the power for all the military toys. As Leslie and Patrick confront Leland, Alsatia is attacked by the Sea Swine and is revealed to be a [[Gynoid|robot]], built by Kenneth to be a companion for Leslie after the death of his mother. As Leslie and Patrick tend to Alsatia, Leland tries to escape, but the Sea Swine stops and attacks him.  As Leland is hospitalized, Leslie takes control of the factory and continues his relationship with Gwen, and Alsatia is fully repaired. Owen continues to work at Zevo, and Patrick prepares to leave to take on further missions, but remains with the others long enough to attend a brief memorial to Kenneth.  
Tokyo Decadence
 A timid Japanese college student, , works as a specialty prostitute for an exclusive escort agency that caters to wealthy, mostly perverted, Japanese men in [[Tokyo]]. To please her clients, she has to play out elaborate fantasy scenarios involving sexual humiliation and light [[sadism and masochism|SM]]/[[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]].  The first two-thirds of the film consists in large part of four sex sequences. Two involve [[dildo]]s and mirrors—one with the man [[Dominant (BDSM)|dominant]], one with the female dominant. The other two involve erotic [[asphyxiation]] with, again, one episode in which the man wants to partially asphyxiate a female and the other in which a man is the recipient. Other sexual acts and interests are involved in some of the scenarios.  However, the actual story revolves around Ai's unrequited love for a married gallery artist who has ended his relationship with her. At the beginning of the movie Ai visits a [[fortune-teller]], played by artist [[Yayoi Kusama]], who advises her to find a "pink stone", and then fashion it into a ring. The fortune teller also advises Ai to put a telephone directory under her television and to avoid a gallery in the east. Ai later loses the ring and risks her life to recover it.  The last third of the story is about Ai's problematic attempt to go to the artist's home while she is under the influence of an unidentified drug. Ai has the police called on her but is rescued by one of the artist's neighbors who knows who she is; the other woman's affair with the artist has apparently ended and she tells Ai that she considers her to be her "best friend".  There are at least two versions of ''Tokyo Decadence'', with the shorter one edited more for pacing than for [[censorship]].  
Tom and Jerry: The Movie
 While moving house with their owners, Tom and Jerry get into a chase, and Tom nails Jerry inside his mousehole with floorboards, and is pleased to have kept the mouse from coming with him, but misses the moving van and is forced to stay in the house after angering a nearby bulldog. The house is demolished the next morning with Tom going back inside to rescue Jerry, leaving them both homeless. Wandering through the city, they meet a dog, Puggsy, and his flea friend, Frankie, when Tom and Jerry introduce themselves they are both surprised at the fact that the other can talk. Puggsy and Frankie try to persuade them to be friends. While finding food from some nearby bins for a feast, Puggsy and Frankie are captured by two dogcatchers, while Tom and Jerry end up in a tussle with some alley cats. They escape after Jerry fools them into falling into the sewer.  They then cross paths with a girl, Robyn Starling, who has run away from home. She tells them that since her mother died when she was still  a baby and her father was apparently killed in a recent avalanche while on a mountain-climbing expedition, she has been living with her evil guardian, "Aunt" Pristine Figg, her scheming lawyer and boyfriend, Lickboot, and her overweight skateboarding dog, Ferdinand, but ran away after Figg threw Robyn's locket out of the window. Despite Robyn's misgivings, Tom and Jerry persuade her to return home and they are taken in as pets. Tom and Jerry, end up in a massive food fight with Ferdinand, and stumble across a telegram confirming that Robyn's father is still alive which Figg hides from Robyn. Figg sends them to an animal shelter run by Dr. Applecheek, who turns out to be a cruel animal kidnapper, and the true employer of the two dogcatchers who caught Puggsy. Reuniting with Puggsy and Frankie in the cells, Tom and Jerry tell them all that has happened, then stage an escape and free all of Applecheek's captured animals, among them Droopy, and rush to tell Robyn the news. Elated, Robyn becomes determined to find her father in Tibet and they escape the city on a raft in the river, but the raft is struck by a ship and they end up separated. Figg places a $1 million bounty on Robyn without even planning to give that kind of money, while Mr. Starling is alerted of his daughter's situation and rushes back to America to find her.  Robyn is found by Captain Kiddie, the owner of a failing amusement park, and he houses her until seeing an advertisement for the reward on a milk cardboard with the help of his parrot puppet Squawk, upon which he traps Robyn on the ferris wheel and contacts Figg. Tom and Jerry also find Robyn and they flee in a [[paddle steamer]] as Figg, Lickboot, Applecheek and the dogcatchers arrive. A long chase ensues, in which the dogcatchers end up trapped in the ferris wheel and Kiddie and Applecheek are left stranded in the river. Following the river, Tom, Jerry and Robyn arrive at Robyn's summer cabin (built by her father), but Figg, Lickboot, and Ferdinand have arrived first. In the ensuing scuffle, a lantern is knocked over and the cabin is set on fire. As Figg, Lickboot, and Ferdinand flee on Robyn's paddle steamer which goes off out of control, Tom and Jerry manage to get Robyn to the roof just as Mr. Starling arrives in his helicopter. Robyn is saved, but Mr. Starling is unable to reach Tom and Jerry in time before the cabin collapses. They only barely survive and are reunited with Robyn.  In the aftermath, Robyn takes Tom and Jerry in as her pets, while Figg and Lickboot are arrested by Mr. Starling and sent to prison. Just when it appears that they have found friendship, however, old habits die hard and the duo resume their antics. The film closes as Tom chases Jerry once again.

Toutes peines confondues (film)
 The French detective superintendent Christophe Vade (Patrick Bruel) investigates the murder of an elderly French couple in the [[French Alps]]. In the course of his investigation he encounters Jeanne Gardella (Mathilda May), the wife of the businessman Antoine Gardella (Jacques Dutronc), a member of organized crime, and the son of the murdered couple. Antoine Gardella and his wife Jeanne live harmoniously, but Jeanne Gardella was forced by Thurson (Vernon Dobtcheff), a dubious agent of [[Interpol]] to her "role as wife" in the context of an undercover action against the European [[organized crime]]. Despite his criminal background, Jeanne loves her husband. Thurson also urges Christophe Vade to investigate Gardella and his wife in connection with the murder of those parents, and to get an additional pressure medium to gouge Jeanne Gardella to continue that farce. Thurson does not explain that plan either to inspector Vade or Jeanne Gardella, who fell in love, finally tolerated by Antoine Gardella who accepts that his wife was forced to that undercover action by Thurson. Tightly interwoven with the main story, the subplot plays in the ''milieu'' of the Swiss city of Zürich, and the advances of the brutal and corrupt city police officer Scatamacchia (Hans Heinz Moser) against a hostess allow a very personal view on Scandurat (Bruce Myers), Gardella's business partner and close friend. Finally, Vadella is forced to kill Vade and Jeanne, but refuses and choices suicide, to meet the unwritten rules within the organized crime.  
Twin Dragons
 In 1965, a [[Hong Kong]] couple ([[Sylvia Chang]] and [[James Wong (lyricist)|James Wong]]) are doting on their newborn twin boys. Meanwhile, a dangerous gang leader named Crazy Kung ([[Kirk Wong]]) is being transported as a captive in the same hospital. Crazy Kung escapes and attempts to take one of the twins hostage, and in the ensuing chaos the twins are permanently separated. One of them, named Ma Yau, is taken to America by his parents and grows up to be a concert pianist and conductor. The other, Ma Wan, is found and raised by a woman named Tsui ([[Mabel Cheung]]), and becomes a street racer and martial artist named Bok Min. For years, neither of them is aware that he has a twin brother.  26 years later, the twins' ([[Jackie Chan]]) lives intersect in Hong Kong once again. Bok Min and his best friend Tarzan ([[Teddy Robin]]) get mixed up with a dangerous gang, while Ma Yau prepares to conduct a major concert. In addition, the twins gain romantic interests: Bok Min meets Barbara ([[Maggie Cheung]]), a club singer Tarzan is interested in, and Wan becomes acquainted with Tong Sum ([[Nina Li Chi]]), a  young woman from a respectable family who has a secret passion for fighter types. Eventually, the twins meet and discover a strange connection with each other. As a result, a string of hilarious mix-ups ensues when Ma Yau is accidentally enlisted by the gangsters to participate as an escape driver in the liberation of none other than Crazy Kung; Bok Min is forced to conduct Yau's concert (which becomes a smash hit despite him having absolutely no musical talent), and the two of them end up with the other's girl as their respective girlfriend.  Eventually, things come to a head when Tarzan is kidnapped by the gangsters. The twins join up to defeat the gang that has turned their lives upside down, and in a showdown in a [[Vehicle inspection|vehicle testing center]] Crazy Kung ends his life inside a runaway [[Crash test|crash test car]] with no [[seat belt]] on. The film ends with the impending double wedding of the twins to their girls and Bok Min's introduction to his real parents; but when Bok Min gets cold feet and Ma Yau goes looking for him, a final gag falls into place when the wedding guests catch the two twins together and are unable to tell them apart.

Trespass (1992 film)
 Two Arkansas firemen, Vince ([[Bill Paxton]]) and Don ([[William Sadler (Actor)|William Sadler]]), meet an hysterical old man in a burning building. The old man hands them a map, prays for forgiveness, then allows himself to be engulfed in flames. Outside the fire and away from everyone else, Don does a little research and finds out that the man was a thief who stole a large amount of gold valuables from a church and hid them in a building in [[East St. Louis, Illinois|East St. Louis]]. The two decide to drive there, thinking they can get there, get the gold, and get back in one day.  While looking around in the abandoned building, they are spotted by a gang, led by King James ([[Ice-T]]), who is there to execute an enemy. Vince and Don witness the murder, but give themselves away and only manage to force a stalemate when they grab Lucky ([[De'voreaux White]]), King James' half-brother. Barricading themselves behind a door, they continue trying to find where the gold is at. Adding to their troubles is an old homeless man, Bradlee ([[Art Evans (actor)|Art Evans]]), who had stumbled in on them while they were trying to find the gold.  King James eventually calls in some reinforcements. While doing some reconnaissance, Raymond ([[Bruce A. Young]]), the man who supplies guns to King James, finds Don and Vince's car and the news of the gold, and figures out why "two white boys" would be in their neighborhood. Raymond manipulates Savon ([[Ice Cube]]), one of James' men (who would rather just kill Don and Vince than follow James' approach of trying to talk to them) into shooting at Don and Vince, which eventually leads to Lucky's being shot himself. (Savon: "I guess he wasn't ''too'' lucky, huh?") King James is now furious and runs after Don and Vince, who have now found the stash of gold (having determined the map was drawn with the intention of looking UP at the ceiling, instead of down at the floor) and are trying to get out with it while avoiding King James.  The gold changes hands several times, once with Savon, then again with Bradlee, while people are shooting everywhere. Eventually, Don and King James meet and end up killing each other. Savon and Raymond also kill each other. The building they were in gets burned to the ground. Vince encounters Bradlee outside the building, and Bradlee tells Vince to run. (Vince cannot drive away, since Raymond ripped out the wires in his engine, gave him four flat tires, and cut the line to his [[CB radio]]). Once Vince is out of the way, Bradlee picks up the haul of gold that was left behind and walks away, laughing.

Traces of Red
 The movie begins with Jack Dobson, a homicide detective from [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]], flat on his back with a bullet in his chest. The movie is then told in flashback form, leading up to the events that led him to this fate.  Jack has been receiving threatening letters. He and his partner Steve Frayn conclude that the source must be a mob figure whom Jack is about to testify against in court. But another possibility is that someone could be causing trouble for Jack's brother, Michael, who is in an election campaign for public office.  Women begin turning up dead with lipstick traces left by the killer. A woman Jack has begun seeing, Ellen Schofield, could be involved. But when Ellen sees Jack leave a restaurant with a woman who soon becomes a victim, suspicion is cast toward Jack himself as the killer. Jack eventually reveals that he was raped as a child by his former 1st grade teacher, Gloria Wurtz. While speaking with Michael, Steve learns that it was by his own mother who raped Jack. Steve decides to go forward with his own investigation but, in the process, winds up having sex with Ellen, much to his wife's (who he earlier celebrated his seventh wedding anniversary with) and Jack's (who now sees him as a traitor) dismay. After Ellen turns up dead, Jack decides to take Beth (Steve's wife) with him to a secluded getaway home, immediately following Steve confiding in Jack that he trusted him. After finding evidence that Jack is indeed the killer, Steve and Michael rush to the getaway home where Jack and Beth are. Jack is holding Beth and is seemingly about to strangle her when Steve yells at Jack to freeze. Jack pushes Beth aside and draws his gun, but is shot by Steve before he can get off a shot. Then, Jack (in narrative form) says "I guess you probably thought that I was some kind of hero when you first saw me laying there, at the beginning. Wrong. But the story wasn't over ...... not yet." Eventually, Michael is revealed to be the real killer. Jack's murder was faked, as he wanted to give Michael a false sense of security that he was dead, and responsible for the murdered women. Michael is set up to seemingly be alone with a woman in a hotel room. After he attempts to strangle the woman, Steve bursts into the room with his gun drawn, and tells Michael to freeze. It is then revealed that Jack is not dead, much to Michael's shock. Jack tells Steven and the woman to leave the room, so that he can talk to his brother alone. As they are embracing, Michael manages to take Jack's gun. Michael then commits suicide by shooting himself in the temple. The movie concludes with Steve asking Jack if he's ready (after his brother's funeral), to which Jack replies, "I will be."

The surviving ship's company are imprisoned in the [[forecastle]], except for some stragglers in unsecured areas. Strannix intends to sell the ship's [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk missiles]] by unloading them onto a submarine he previously stole from [[North Korea]]. Strannix and his men take over the ship's weapon systems, shooting down a jet sent to investigate, and plan on covering their escape by using missiles to obliterate tracking systems in [[Pearl Harbor]].  When Ryback's constant insistence causes Private Nash to finally contact the bridge, Krill realizes they forgot about Ryback, and Strannix sends two mercenaries to eliminate Ryback and Nash. Nash is killed, but Ryback in turn slays the assassins and infiltrates the ship. During his search of the ''Missouri'', he picks up Tate, an innocent decoy in Strannix's plan, and allows her to tag along. He contacts Admiral Bates at the Pentagon on satellite phone, whereupon the Navy informs him about them sending a SEAL team to retake the ship.  After discovering their dead operatives and Ryback's escape, Krill finds out that Ryback is not just a [[Chief Petty Officer]], but a former [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] with extensive training in anti-terrorism tactics who lost his status after his entire team was eliminated in a botched operation due to poor intelligence, prompting Ryback to retaliate against his commanding officer. To keep the missile-theft plan in place, Krill activates the fire suppression system in the forecastle, leaving the crew members to drown. The terrorists expect that Ryback will try to save his colleagues, and set up an ambush.  Ryback and Tate hear six sailors banging on pipes in Morse code and rescue them. Together, they overcome the ambush, shut off the water in the forecastle, and eliminate several terrorists. Ryback shuts down ''Missouri''s weapon systems to allow the incoming Navy SEALs to land, but the submarine crew shoots down the helicopter carrying the Navy SEALs with shoulder-fired [[surface-to-air missile]]s. The Pentagon responds by ordering an air strike that will sink ''Missouri''. Strannix regains control of the ship's weapon systems and loads the Tomahawks onto the submarine. With the aid of a retired World War II [[Gunner's Mate]] among the six rescued sailors, Ryback uses the battleship's  guns to sink the submarine, killing Krill and everyone on board.  Strannix, suffering from a breakdown from Ryback continually thwarting his scheme, launches two nuclear-tipped Tomahawks towards [[Honolulu]]. As the sailors recapture the ship, Ryback finds his way into the control room, where he is surprised by Strannix; the two quickly recognize each other from their prior covert experiences. Ryback disarms Strannix, and the two engage in a knife melee. Ryback gains the upper hand, kills Strannix, and takes the launch code disk needed to self-destruct the Tomahawk missiles. A fighter jet destroys one of the missiles, and the other is deactivated just in time; the Navy calls off its airstrike.  The remaining crew members are freed as the ship sails towards San Francisco harbor. A funeral ceremony for Captain Adams is held on the deck of ''Missouri'', showing Ryback saluting the captain's coffin in his formal dress uniform with full decorations.  
Unforgiven
 In 1881 in Big Whiskey, [[Wyoming]], two cowboys, Quick Mike and "Davey-Boy" Bunting, attack and disfigure prostitute Delilah Fitzgerald with a knife after she laughs at the small size of Quick Mike's penis. As punishment, local sheriff "Little Bill" Daggett orders the cowboys to pay compensation in the form of several horses to the brothel owner, Skinny Dubois. The rest of the prostitutes do not consider this justice and offer a $1,000 reward to anyone who kills the cowboys, much to the fury of Little Bill who does not allow guns or criminals in his town.  Miles away in [[Kansas]], a boastful young man calling himself the "[[Smith & Wesson Model 3#Schofield Revolver|Schofield]] Kid" visits the pig farm of reformed bandit William Munny, seeking to recruit him to help kill the cowboys and claim the reward. In his youth, Munny was a notorious murderer, however he is now a repentant widower raising two children and has long since sworn off alcohol and killing. Initially refusing to help, Munny recognizes that his farm is failing, putting his children's future in jeopardy, and so reconsiders a few days later and sets off to catch up with the Kid. On his way, Munny recruits his friend Ned Logan, another retired gunfighter.  Back in Wyoming, British-born gunfighter "English Bob", an old acquaintance and rival of Little Bill, is also seeking the reward and arrives in Big Whiskey with a biographer, W. W. Beauchamp. Little Bill and his deputies disarm Bob and Bill beats him savagely, hoping to discourage other would-be assassins from attempting to claim the bounty. The next morning he ejects Bob from town, but Beauchamp decides to stay and write about Bill, who has impressed him with his tales of old gunfights and seeming knowledge of the gunfighter's psyche.  Munny, Logan and the Kid arrive later during a rain storm and head into the saloon/whorehouse to meet with the prostitutes and learn the cowboys' location. Delirious with fever after riding in the rain, Munny is sitting alone in the saloon when Little Bill and his deputies arrive to confront him. Not realizing Munny's identity and believing him to be drunk, Little Bill beats him and kicks him out of the saloon after finding that he is carrying a pistol. Logan and the Kid, upstairs getting advances in kind on their payment from the prostitutes, escape through a back window. The three regroup at a barn outside town, where they nurse Munny back to health.  Three days later, they ambush a group of cowboys and kill Bunting, though Logan and Munny show that they no longer have much stomach for murder. Logan decides to quit and return home, while Munny feels they must finish the job. Munny and the Kid head to the cowboys' ranch, where the Kid ambushes Quick Mike in an outhouse and kills him. After they escape, a distraught Kid confesses he had never killed anyone before and renounces life as a gunfighter. When one of the prostitutes meets the two men outside of Big Whiskey to give them the reward, they learn that Logan was intercepted by Little Bill's men and tortured to death, in the process revealing Munny's true identity to Little Bill. The Kid heads back to Kansas to deliver the reward money to Munny's children and Logan's wife, while an embittered Munny, finishing Logan's bottle of whiskey after not drinking for years, returns to town to take revenge on Little Bill.  That night, Munny arrives and sees Logan's corpse displayed in a coffin outside the saloon with a sign reading "". Inside, Little Bill has assembled a posse to pursue Munny and the Kid. Munny walks in alone to confront the posse and kills Dubois. Munny then shoots Bill and kills several of his deputies, ordering the others to leave the saloon. Critically wounded, Bill vows to "see [Munny] in hell" before Munny finishes him. Munny then threatens the townsfolk before finally leaving Big Whiskey, warning that he will return for more vengeance if Logan is not buried properly or if any of the prostitutes are harmed.  A title card epilogue says that Munny may have moved to San Francisco with his children where he prospered in dry goods.  
Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me
 [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Regional Bureau Chief [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Gordon Cole|Gordon Cole]] sends agents [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Chester Desmond|Chester Desmond]] and [[List of Twin Peaks characters#FBI Special Agent Sam Stanley|Sam Stanley]] to investigate the murder of drifter and teenage prostitute [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Teresa Banks|Teresa Banks]] in the town of Deer Meadow, Washington. The pair are informed about their new assignment through a woman named Lil. On her lapel is a tiny, artificial blue rose, clearly symbolic of something; when Sam asks, Chet simply replies, "But I can't tell you about that." Desmond and Stanley view Teresa's body at the local morgue. They notice that a ring is missing from her finger and a small piece of paper printed with the letter "T" has been inserted under one of her fingernails. Later, Desmond discovers Teresa's missing ring under a trailer. As he reaches out to it, he is taken by an unseen force.  At FBI headquarters in [[Philadelphia]], Cole and Agent [[Dale Cooper]] experience a brief vision of their long-lost colleague Agent [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Phillip Jeffries|Phillip Jeffries]]. He tells them about a meeting he witnessed involving several mysterious spirits&nbsp;— [[The Man from Another Place]], [[Killer BOB]], Mrs. Chalfont and her grandson. Agent Cooper is sent to Deer Meadow to investigate Desmond's disappearance, but finds no answers.  One year later in Twin Peaks, high school homecoming queen Laura Palmer and her best friend [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Donna Hayward|Donna Hayward]] attend school. Laura is addicted to [[cocaine]] and is cheating on her boyfriend, the arrogant and ill-tempered jock [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Bobby Briggs|Bobby Briggs]], with the biker [[List of Twin Peaks characters#James Hurley|James Hurley]]. Laura realizes pages are missing from her secret diary, and gives the rest of the diary to her friend, the [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] recluse [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Harold Smith|Harold Smith]].  Mrs. Chalfont and her grandson appear to Laura. They warn her that the "man behind the mask" is in her bedroom. Laura runs home, where she sees BOB. She rushes outside in terror and is startled to see her father, [[Leland Palmer|Leland]], emerge from the house. That evening Leland's behavior is erratic and abusive—he accusingly asks her about her romances, then tenderly tells her he loves her.  Laura has a dream about entering the [[Black and White Lodges|Black Lodge]]. Cooper and the Man from Another Place appear in her dream. The Man from Another Place informs Cooper that "I am the arm", revealing his identity as MIKE's severed arm, and offers Teresa's ring to Laura, but Cooper tells her not to take it. Laura finds [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Annie Blackburn|Annie Blackburn]] next to her in bed, covered in blood. Annie tells Laura to write in her diary that "the good Dale is in the Lodge and cannot leave". Laura sees the ring in her hand, but when she wakes up the next morning, it is gone.  The next evening, Laura goes to the Roadhouse to meet her drug connections and have sex with strange men. Unexpectedly, Donna shows up. They all go to the Pink Room. Laura discusses Teresa Banks's murder with [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Ronette Pulaski|Ronette Pulaski]], and Ronette says that Teresa was trying to blackmail someone. When she sees a topless Donna making out with a stranger, a distraught Laura takes her home and begs Donna not to become like her. The next morning, Philip Gerard, the one-armed man possessed by the repentant demon [[MIKE]], in an attempt to warn Laura about her father and Bob, pulls up alongside Leland's car and shows Teresa's ring to Laura.  Leland recalls his affair with Teresa. He had asked Teresa to set up a [[Foursome (group sex)|foursome]] and invite some of her friends, but fled when he discovered Laura was among them. Teresa realized who he was and plotted to blackmail him, and he killed her to prevent his secrets from being revealed. Laura realizes that Mike's ring was the one from her dream, and was also worn by Teresa. The next night, BOB comes through Laura's window and begins to rape her, only to transform into Leland.  Upset, Laura uses more cocaine and has trouble concentrating at school. When Bobby realizes Laura is only using him to score cocaine, he breaks off their relationship. Laura then breaks up with James and goes to a cabin in the woods for an orgy with Ronette, Jacques and Leo. Leland follows her there and, after attacking Jacques and scaring away Leo, takes Laura and Ronette to an abandoned train car.  Laura asks Leland if he is going to kill her, but he transforms into BOB, who tells Laura that he intends to possess her. MIKE has tracked the BOB-possessed Leland to the train, but when Ronette tries to let him in, BOB beats her unconscious. Mike manages to throw in Teresa's ring. Laura puts it on, which prevents BOB from possessing her. Enraged, BOB stabs Laura to death. The BOB-possessed Leland places Laura's body in the lake.  As her corpse drifts away, the BOB-possessed Leland enters the Red Room, where he encounters MIKE and the Man from Another Place who announce they want their share of "garmonbozia."  As [[Pilot (Twin Peaks)|Laura's body is found by the Sheriff's department]], Agent Cooper comforts her spirit in the Lodge and she sees an angel that had previously disappeared from her bedroom painting.

[[Luc Deveraux]] ([[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]) discovers members of his squad and various villagers murdered, all with their ears removed. Deveraux finds his sergeant, Andrew Scott ([[Dolph Lundgren]]), who has gone [[insane]], with a string of severed ears and holding a young man and woman hostage. Deveraux, who is near the end of his tour of duty, tries to reason with Scott, who executes the man and orders Deveraux to shoot the girl to prove his loyalty. Deveraux refuses and tries to save the girl, but she is killed by a grenade thrown by Scott. After shooting each other to death. Deveraux and Scott's corpses are recovered by a second squad and [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] frozen, their deaths classified as "missing in action".  Deveraux and Scott's corpses are reanimated decades later without prior memories of their previous lives and selected for the "Universal Soldier" (UniSol) program, an elite [[counter-terrorism]] unit, and are deployed via an [[Aero Spacelines Mini Guppy]] to the [[Hoover Dam]] to resolve a hostage situation. Deveraux uses efficient means to dispatch terrorists, but Scott uses excessive force, which causes concern among the project technicians. The team demonstrates their superior training and physical abilities against the terrorists, such as when GR76 ([[Ralf Möller]]) withstands close-range rifle fire. After the area is secured, Deveraux begins to regain memory from his former life upon seeing two hostages who strongly resemble the villagers he tried to save in Vietnam, causing him to disobey commands from the control team and become unresponsive.  In the mobile [[command center]], it is revealed that the UniSols are [[genetically augmented]] soldiers with enhanced self-healing abilities and superior strength, but they also have a tendency to overheat and shut down. They are given a neural serum to keep their minds susceptible and their [[Memory inhibition|past memory suppressed]]. As a result of the glitch, Woodward ([[Leon Rippy]]), one of the technicians on the project, feels it may be better to remove Deveraux from the team until he can be further analyzed, but UniSol commander Colonel Perry ([[Ed O'Ross]]) refuses. TV journalist, Veronica Roberts ([[Ally Walker]]), who was fired while covering the Hoover Dam incident, tries to get a story on the UniSol project in order to get her job back. Roberts sneaks onto the base with a cameraman, discovering GR76 immersed in ice, still alive despite normally-fatal injuries.  When her presence is noticed, Deveraux and Scott are ordered to capture her dead or alive. She flees to her cameraman's car, but they crash. Scott coldly murders the cameraman against orders before Deveraux stops him from shooting Roberts. Together, Deveraux and Roberts escape in a UniSol vehicle. Colonel Perry insists on preventing knowledge of the UniSol program getting out, not only to the public, but to [[the Pentagon]], having no knowledge to the true nature of the project. Deveraux and Roberts flee to a motel, where Roberts discovers she has been framed for the murder of her cameraman. Scott's previously insane personality resurfaces, causing him to kill Perry (who wants to terminate the project), the second in command, and the technicians. Scott then takes control of the mindlessly obedient UniSol team, commanding them to search and destroy Deveraux and Roberts.  Deveraux continues to regain his memories while Roberts tries to find out more information about the UniSol program. They step into a greasy spoon diner in the middle of the desert. Deveraux finds himself alone there for a while and starts ordering and devouring plate after plate of food, until the waitress asks how he's going to pay for it all. When Deveraux looks blankly at her, she calls out Hank, the cook, who threatens to harm him for being a deadbeat. However, Deveraux, though innocently saying he doesn't want to hurt him, easily beats Hank and every single patron who steps up to take him on.  Roberts and Deveraux meet Dr. Christopher Gregor ([[Jerry Orbach]]), the creator of the program, who informs them that the UniSol project was started in the 1960s in order to develop the perfect soldier. Although they were able to reanimate dead humans, they were never able to overcome the body's need for constant cooling. The other major problem is that memories of the last moments of life are greatly amplified. In Deveraux's case, he still believes he is a soldier who wants to go home, while Scott believes he is still in Vietnam fighting insurgents. When Deveraux and Roberts leave the doctor's home, they are caught and arrested by the police. En route to jail, the police convoy is ambushed by Scott and GR76. A chase ensues, ending when the police bus and the UniSol truck both drive off a cliff and explode, killing GR76. Deveraux and Roberts head to Deveraux's family's farm in [[Louisiana]].  After Deveraux is reunites with his parents, Scott appears and takes the family and Roberts hostage. A brutal fight ensues, and Scott's use of muscle enhancers enables him to beat Deveraux mercilessly. Roberts manages to escape, only to be seemingly killed by a grenade thrown by Scott. Deveraux grabs the muscle enhancers Scott used and injects himself. Now evenly matched, Deveraux fights back and is able to impale Scott on the spikes of a hay harvester. Deveraux then starts the machine up, grinding Scott into alfalfa. Roberts is revealed to have survived the explosion, and she and Deveraux embrace.  ===Alternative ending=== The Special Edition DVD release features an alternative ending which starts shortly after Scott takes Deveraux's family and Roberts hostage. As Deveraux grabs a shotgun in the kitchen, the front door opens and he sees his mother at the door before Scott shoots her to death. In the final fight between Deveraux and Scott, Deveraux does not use Scott's muscle enhancers. Shortly after grinding Scott to death, Deveraux is shot by his "father" before Dr. Christopher Gregor and his men appear.  Gregor explains that he used Deveraux to entrap both him and Scott, and that Deveraux was staying with people posing as his parents. He then has his men shoot Deveraux, but, before Deveraux dies, the police and Roberts' news crew arrive. The news crew douse Deveraux with a fire extinguisher to stabilize him while Dr. Gregor and his men are arrested. Roberts is given the microphone to cover the arrest, but she loses all composure while on the air, dropping the microphone to comfort Deveraux.  Several days later, Deveraux is reunited with his real parents. The film ends with a eulogy narrated by Roberts, who explains that Deveraux rejected all life-prolonging medication before dying a natural death.

Vacas
  Fighting in the trenches of [[Biscay]] in 1875 during the [[Third Carlist War]], Carmelo Mendiluze, an army sergeant, learns from a young errand boy named Ilegorri that Manuel Iriguíbel, his neighbor from his native village, has joined their exhausted battalion. Eager for news of his child's birth, Carmelo befriends the inexperienced soldier whose reputation as an expert [[aizcolari]] (competition log cutter) cannot conceal his apprehension and fear of armed combat.  Panicking under fire, Manuel drops to the ground and smears himself with blood gushing hot from the neck of his mortally wounded neighbor, Mendiluze. When the battle is over, Manuel crawls out from a cartload of the dead, naked bodies as he is transported away from the front lines. Nobody has seen his escape, except a curious, solitary cow.  Thirty years later, in 1905 in rural [[Guipúzcoa]], a lingering animosity has continued between the Mendiluze and Iriguíbel families. Manuel, now an old man, is still regarded as a coward; he spends his time painting the family’s cows watched over by his three granddaughters, the offspring of his son Ignacio Iriguíbel and his wife Madalen. Ignacio and Carmelo's son, Juan Mendiluze, have maintained family traditions by honing their skills as aizcolari. Despite the strained relations between the neighbors, the destinies of the two families are fatefully interconnected. Juan's sister, Catalina, cannot conceal her romantic interest for Ignacio as she furtively watches him practice cutting logs in the woods - an attraction that proves to be mutual through Ignacio's playful attempts to catch her already piqued attention. Paulina, the Mendiluze widow, warns her daughter that her interest for Ignacio Iriguíbel will bring the downfall of the Mendiluze family. In an attempt to capitalize from the rivalry between the two families, Ilegorri, now a grown man, arranges a waged competition between Ignacio and Juan. Ignacio wins and his career as an aizcolari contender is launched. Catalina and Ignacio start a secret affair.  Ten years later, in the spring of 1915, Ignacio returns home after traveling to national competitions. He now enjoys fame and success. Although Ignacio takes care of his family farm, he neglects Madalen, his wife. He is promptly reunited with Catalina, and they have a ten-year-old son. After the death of their mother, the relationship between the bitter Juan and Catalina is increasingly strained. Juan, still a bachelor, is more obsessed and delusional in his incestuous feelings for his sister. Catalina, afraid of him, wants to escape to America with Ignacio. A close childhood friendship develops between Peru, Catalina and Ignacio's ten-year-old illegitimate son, and his half-sister Cristina; they wander amidst the mountain forest under the supervision of their limp and old grandfather, Manuel. Eventually the boy's parents elope to America and take him with them.  In the summer of 1936, Peru has left his family behind, coming back to Guipúzcoa, as a photojournalist reporting on the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The Mendiluze farmhouse is empty. Juan, his uncle, has put on his [[Carlist]] red beret, joining the Nationalists. Peru is reunited with Cristina, his half-sister and childhood sweetheart. He stays  at the Iriguíbel’s farm. Cristina has had a relationship with Lucas, Iligorri’s son. She shows Peru the last paintings made by their grandfather. The Spanish Civil War comes to the village.

White Men Can't Jump
 Billy Hoyle (Harrelson) is a former Tulane basketball player who makes his living by hustling [[streetball|streetballers]] who assume he cannot play well because he is white. Billy never degrades his race when joining on pickup games; he simply allows his opponents, most of whom are black, to believe they have a natural advantage over him due to his race and clothing style. Such a player is Sidney Deane (Snipes), a talented but cocky player who is beaten twice by Billy, once in a half court team game and later in a one-on-one shootout for money.  Billy and his [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] girlfriend, Gloria Clemente (Rosie Perez), are on the run from mobsters because of a gambling debt. A voracious reader, making note of obscure facts, Gloria's goal in life is to be a contestant on the television show ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' and make a fortune. Sidney wants to buy a house for his family outside the rough [[Baldwin Village, Los Angeles|Baldwin Village]] neighborhood. He proposes a business partnership with Billy and they hustle other players by deliberately setting them up to pick Billy as Sidney's teammate. At first their system is very successful, but when they unexpectedly lose a game, it turns out that Sidney had double-crossed Billy by deliberately playing badly to avenge his earlier loss to him, making Billy lose $1,700 to a group of Sidney's friends.   Gloria, who wants Billy to find a stable job, is incensed at Billy for blowing his money again, but realizes he got hustled after Billy tells her how it happened. They go to Sidney's apartment and appeal to his wife Rhonda for fairness, and the women agree to share the money provided Sidney and Billy team up for a major two-on-two outdoor tournament. Despite their constant bickering, Sidney and Billy win the tournament and the grand prize of $5,000, largely due to Billy's ability to disrupt his opponents' concentration. Billy's most notable claim is that he is "[[Flow (psychology)|in the zone]]", a state of mind in which nothing can distract him. Sidney is pleased with the outcome, yet he cannot help mocking Billy about his inability to [[slam dunk]].   Billy insists that he can indeed dunk, and after Sidney clearly disagrees, Billy offers to bet his share of the $5,000 on his ability to dunk. Sidney gives him three chances, telling him "white men can't jump," but Billy fails and squanders his share. When he tells Gloria, she leaves him. Desperate to get her back, Billy goes to Sidney for help. Sidney reveals that he has a friend who works as a security guard at the TV studio that produces ''Jeopardy!'' The friend, Robert, agrees to use his connections to get her on the show if Billy can sink a hook shot from beyond the half-court line, which he does. Gloria initially stumbles over sports questions (such as naming [[Babe Ruth]] as the [[Wilt Chamberlain|all-time NBA rebound leader]]), but makes a comeback with a pet topic, "Foods That Begin With the Letter Q". She wins $14,100 on her first episode.  Billy sings Gloria a song he has composed and wins her back. As Billy and Gloria discuss their new future, this time it is Sidney who is desperate for Billy's help; his apartment was burglarized and his winnings stolen, so he and Rhonda are desperate for money so they can move to a better neighborhood. Gloria is expecting Billy to get a steady job and settle down, but Sidney informs him that two hoops legends of the L.A. streetball scene, "The King" and "The Duck", are playing at the courts downtown. Sidney asks Billy to partner with him in playing against them and Billy enthusiastically agrees, offering to gamble his share of Gloria's take. Gloria warns that if Billy gambles with her money, they are through, regardless of the outcome. Billy, feeling he must honor the obligation he owes Sidney for getting Gloria on ''Jeopardy!'' in the first place, sides with Sidney. They play a final game against King and Duck. In a very tight game, Sidney and Billy prevail, the winning point coming when Sidney lobs an "alley-oop" pass to Billy, who dunks it.  Returning home happy for having doubled the share that Gloria gave him of her winnings, Billy discovers Gloria has kept her word and left him for good, and is crushed. The mobsters who are after Billy track him down, and he pays off his debts. Realizing that Gloria has left him for good, Billy asks Sidney to set him up with a real job. Sidney remarks that Billy and Gloria may be better off without each other. The film ends as Billy and Sidney launch into yet another basketball argument and they return to the court where they first met to play a one-on-one game, but this time, as friends.

In the end Shudo is defeated, but Daishu and Taki's friends die, too. Windy leaves alone.  ===Synopsis=== The film begins with the sun setting in Tokyo. Unknown to most people, there is the demonic "Rapter World" in conflict with human world. Rapters shift their shapes and infiltrate human world. Taki (or "Leung", played by Leon Lai) is a sales of a Hong Kong import/export company, but that is only his cover. He reveals his real occupation when he hunts down a seductive spider-like rapter in Tokyo. Ken saved his life when Taki ran out of bullets. Taki belongs to the Anti-Rapter Special Police. One day he is transferred back to Hong Kong. The 1997 [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|transfer of Hong Kong]] is near, Anti-Rapter Special Police Headquarter transferred many agents from Hong Kong to the United Kingdom. This is a chaotic period when Hong Kong is most vulnerable to rapters. That's why Taki is sent to Hong Kong to help.  Also in the unit is Taki's buddy Ken Kai (or "Ying", Jacky Cheung). Ken's father fall in love with a rapter, thus in the veins of Ken flows the black blood of rapter, which caused distrust on him every time. But he always hopes to prove his humanity. Besides Taki, Orchid ("Loh", by Carman Lee) is the only one in the unit on his side. When Ken felt Taki did not trust him well enough, Taki tells him about his past relationship with a rapter, Windy ("Gaye", Michelle Reis). Taki is ordered to arrest Windy and is critically injured by the other rapters who are hunting down Windy. Windy heals him out of goodwill, as she escapes to the human world in hope for peace, and the two becomes romantically bound. However Taki is afraid he will step into Ken's father's shoes, and he eventually ran away from Windy.  Once Taki is back in Hong Kong from Tokyo, the unit begins investigation on an addictive and harmful [[performance-enhancing drug]] named "Happiness". The emotionless leader of the police unit Sergeant Kayama ("Commander", Yuen Woo-ping) suspects that Happiness is imported from the Rapter World by a tycoon named Daishu ("Yuen", Tatsuya Nakadai). He orders Taki and Ken to slip into Daishu's mysterious 150th birthday party. There Taki meets his former lover ("Gaye", Michelle Reis), who is now a mistress of Daishu. On the other hand, Daishu and his raptor staffs are having a meeting, because they don't know who is importing Happiness the drug either. The staffs are nervous, but Daishu persuades them to control humans' economy to bargain with humans.  The meeting is attacked by two rapter killers. All other staffs are killed. Daishu is injured and Windy is injected with Happiness, however they escape from killers and police. Sergeant Kayama suspects a traitor in the unit. He suspends Ken from duty and says he has a suspicious origin. Knowing rapters would access energy to recover, Sergeant Kayama pays attention to electricity consumption over districts and locates the rapters in a power plant. Taki enters the plant, lets Windy escape but catches Daishu. Windy seeks help from Daishu's son Shudo ("Gwei", Roy Cheung). Shudo orders her loyalty to him and sexual intercourse happens between the two. Windy is sent to hurt Taki with the poison and later she too is caught by police, as she is also framed by Shudo.  Daishu hopes to coexist with humans, since worlds of rapters and humans are together facing the [[energy crisis]]. Further more, he hopes to learn human emotions. His son Shudo is the mastermind who imports Happiness and attacks Daishu. Shudo also trades with Orchid, the real traitor in the police unit. Orchid doesn't care about either humans or rapters, she only wants to make money and leave the city to survive the energy crisis. With help of Windy, Taki and Ken find out the truth, but Windy falls into hands of Shudo. They rescue Daishu from the unit and join forces to fight Shudo and his two killers. On the other hand, Sergeant Kayama's announcement to suspend Ken is a trap to lure out the real traitor. Orchid is caught by Sergeant Kayama after she sabotaged the police unit's facility. Sergeant Kayama kills Orchid in cold blood, and leads a team to go after Taki. Because of Orchid's sabotage, an artificial megnetic field that protects Hong Kong is turned off, and Shudo is now able to turn the time backward to an age when humans are easy to control. Taki and Ken collaborate with Daishu to stop Shudo.  After night battles, Shudo's killers are eliminated by Daishu, but Ken under Shudo's influence turns into a rapter and then is injured by Sergeant Kayama's team. Windy is dying from the effect of Happiness. Daishu returns to his rapter form to battle Shudo. Daishu says it is because only a rapter can kill his own son. Shudo is happy for his father finally turns back to a rapter. Later they jump on an aeroplane and fight above Hong Kong. Daishu's power is weakened by age, but he dives into Shudo's shadow and defeats him with the power of his shadow. Shudo takes Taki as hostage, as he knows human emotion is his father's weakness. As an act to protect Taki, Windy stabs Ken in the stomach. At the same time Ken regains human consciousness. He gives his blood to Windy so that Windy is able to overcome Happiness and rescue Taki from Shudo.  In the end Shudo is killed. Sergeant Kayama's team put the aircraft on the tip of [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong|Bank of China Tower]]. With remorse of failing to prove his humanity, Ken dies in arms of Sergeant Kayama.   Weighting his duty and emotion, Taki frees Daishu and Windy from hands of special police, as he knows Daishu is the one who can protect Windy well. Taki pretends the other police will come down to arrest them and Windy claims she will not appear in the city again, making Taki turning against his missions. As the two turn around, a hurt Taki sadly remarks: "I don't mind, I don't mind at all...". Taki meets a sad Sergeant Kayama and says Kayama may have become too emotional to lead the unit.   On a car, Daishu dies for depletion of energy, hoping humans do not need any more "happiness", leaving only Windy drives away from the city alone at dawn.
