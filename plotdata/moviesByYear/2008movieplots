She complains to her boyfriend, Puak, who went on a camping trip in [[Chiang Mai Province|Chiang Mai]], that she feels so lonely. Every night, Pin exchanges text messages with a stranger, who asks to befriend her and seems friendly enough. The stranger says that he is in somewhere "cramped" for 100 days and is oddly only able to be contacted at night. After sending the mysterious stranger her photo, Pin asks for one in return and is sent the same photo. When she questions him, he says he is in the picture next to her. A ghostly face is slightly visible next to Pin's smiling face. As she researches recent deaths, Pin discovers that the son of Princess Sophia of Virnistan died and was buried with a cellphone so he can communicate with Princess Sophia—his mother, or to connect to someone else whenever he feels lonely. Pin then gets a text from the stranger, saying that he will come to her place now. All of the lights begin to go out and Pin cries in fear. She is then assaulted by the ghost and is thrown out of the window to her death.

Things get worse when everything keeps moving by itself when ordered by Ngid's soul, and one by one the drug addicts start dying. Even though Pink did not beat him, Ngid's soul decides not to spare her too because she had seen it all yet had not do anything to help him. In the end, a police officer comes by to warn her not to go outside, and is shocked to see Pink laughing after having gouged her own eyes; because the curse requires the victim to see Ngid, he cannot harm her anymore now that she has gotten rid of her ability to see.

10,000 BC (film)
 At about 10,000 BC, a tribe of hunter-gatherers called the Yagahl live in a remote mountain range in the Urals and survive by killing woolly mammoths. The camp is led by a hunter who has proven his bravery by killing a mammoth single-handedly, and taking the White Spear. The people also strongly venerate an elderly [[Neanderthal]] woman, the last of her kind, called Old Mother, who has shamanistic powers. As time goes by, the mammoths that supply the people start to dwindle, and the chief of the tribe finds a young girl with blue eyes named Evolet who survived a massacre of her village, perpetrated by what Old Mother calls "four-legged demons" who will come when "the Yagahl go on their last hunt". The chief of the village, not believing in Old Mother's prophecy and desperate to feed his people, leaves and gives the White Spear to his friend Tic'Tic, who also watches over D'Leh, the chief's son. As Tic'Tic alone is entrusted to know of the quest, all the others in the tribe including D'Leh's rival, Ka'Ren, believe that D'Leh's father was a coward and fled. Over time, D'Leh and Evolet fall in love and become close.  When the mammoths finally come, D'Leh and the other men of the tribe hunt them under Tic'Tic's leadership, and D'Leh manages to kill one by causing the beast into impaling itself on his spear, inadvertently winning the White Spear. He also wins Evolet in marriage. However, consumed by the guilt that he did not earn the White Spear fairly, after speaking with Tic'Tic, he gives the White Spear up and by effect, forfeits his marriage to Evolet. The next day, horse-raiders attack the camp, enslaving Evolet and several others and killing many of the tribe. D'Leh, Tic'Tic, Ka'Ren and the young boy Baku set out to rescue Evolet and their fellow Yagahl, but she is recaptured with Ka'Ren and Baku during an attack on the slavers by [[Phorusrhacids|Terror Birds]]. Tic'Tic is wounded by the predators during the battle. D'Leh and the injured Tic'Tic continue on. When D'Leh is out hunting, he falls into a pit-trap. When he wakes from the fall, he rescues a ''[[Smilodon]]'' trapped with him in the pit and then escapes himself. After Tic'Tic recovers, they make their way to a village nearby and learn of a prophecy from the Naku, a tribe they meet: whoever talks to a Smilodon that they call the "Spear-Tooth" will help free their people. D'Leh realizes the prophecy is about him when the sabertooth refuses to kill him when they next meet. They also learn that D'Leh's father, the chief of the Yagahl, was a guest of the Naku and learned from them until the slavers took him captive and Tic'Tic finally reveals to D'Leh why his father left.  Several tribes agree to form a coalition to pursue the raiders that stole their families with D'Leh as their leader. They soon find the ships holding Evolet and their companions. However, with no means to follow the ships, they journey through a vast desert, eventually discovering an advanced civilization similar to ancient Egypt, ruled by an enigmatic figure known as "The Almighty". In this civilization Evolet, Baku and the other kidnapped Yagahl are forced to work as slaves. There, the warlord who kidnapped Evolet tries to coerce her into loving him, only to be arrested by The Almighty when they find he has taken her without permission. During a night scouting raid, D'Leh learns of the Almighty and the fate of his father, who perished as a slave. However, the guards see them and attempt to warn the Almighty. Tic'Tic dies from injuries sustained in the fight that follows with the guards, though not before killing them before they can raise the alarm. The Almighty's priests also meanwhile come to believe that Evolet is destined to kill The Almighty, based on the whip scars on her hands matching the stars they call the "Mark of the Hunter" and an ancient prophecy foreseeing their civilization's downfall. The Almighty realizes that Evolet is not the focus of the prophecy, but the hunter's (D'Leh's) herald. D'Leh then starts a rebellion among the slaves, killing many of the Almighty's forces, though Ka'Ren is killed.  The Almighty offers Evolet and the other hunters to D'Leh in exchange for abandoning his rebellion. D'Leh feigns acceptance of the deal but throws a spear at The Almighty and kills him. During the ensuing battle, Evolet dies at the hands of the warlord before he in turn is killed by D'Leh, but is restored to life by the Old Mother sacrificing her own life with her powers. With the Almighty and his people dead and his civilization destroyed, the Yagahl bid farewell to the other tribes and return home with seeds given to them by the Naku people to begin farming and start a new life.

Simon, a handsome French man (played by French actor Frederic Ledoux) who seduced Eoin at a party the previous year, unexpectedly resurfaces and wants to meet Eoin that day for a coffee.

However, he is troubled by some strange, puzzling letters he has been receiving and after one is left at work, he visits a church to meet a bizarre old woman called Maggie (Geraldine Plunkett). She reveals that she is the mother of a girl he had an affair with the previous year who killed herself shortly afterwards. She accuses him of treating her badly.

21 (2008 film)
 [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] maths major Ben Campbell ([[Jim Sturgess]]) is accepted into [[Harvard Medical School]], but cannot afford the $300,000 fee. Despite a 44 [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]] score and top grades, he faces fierce competition for the prestigious Robinson Scholarship that would pay for medical school in its entirety. The director tells him that the scholarship would go to the student who "dazzles" him. Having nothing that would do that, Ben walks away and tries to write an essay with nothing in mind to compose it.  At MIT, Professor Micky Rosa ([[Kevin Spacey]]) challenges Ben with the [[Monty Hall problem]] in one of his non-linear equation classes, which he solves successfully. After looking at Ben's 97% score on his latest [[non-linear equation]]s paper, Rosa invites Ben to join his [[MIT Blackjack Team|blackjack team]], which consists of fellow students Choi, Fisher, Jill, and Kianna. Despite being told by Rosa that he had already gotten into the Harvard Medical School, Ben refuses to join the team on the premise he had been promoted at his job. Jill visits Ben at his job and attempts to coax him into joining the team. The system involves [[card counting]], and the team is split into two groups. "Spotters" play the minimum bet and keep track of the count. They send secret signals to the "big players", who place large bets whenever the count at the table is favorable. Ben reluctantly joins the team, telling Rosa he is only doing so until he can pay for medical school.  Rosa takes the team to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] over many weekends; Ben comes to enjoy his luxurious lifestyle as a "[[high roller|big player]]". His performance impresses Jill—who develops a mutual attraction with him—and Rosa. However, Fisher becomes jealous of Ben's success and is kicked out of the team after he drunkenly incites a melee, requiring the team to scramble to cash in their stock of [[casino token|chips]] before the casino swaps out. Security chief Cole Williams ([[Laurence Fishburne]]) monitors the blackjack team, having his eyes on Ben. Ben, distracted by [[blackjack]], does not complete his part of a project for an engineering competition, estranging him from his friends. During the next trip to Vegas, an emotionally distracted Ben continues playing even after he is signaled to walk away, thereby losing $200,000. An angered Rosa leaves the team and demands that Ben repay him for the loss, telling he lost because he was [[gambling]] instead of counting. Ben tells Jill he has won over $300,000 and does not intend to stop. Ben and his three remaining teammates agree to go into business for themselves; Williams, however, kidnaps Ben, beats him and frees him after being tipped off by Rosa.  Ben learns that he has been given an incomplete grade in one of his classes and, therefore, will not graduate, and that his winnings have been stolen from his dormitory room. Suspecting Rosa, Ben reconciles with his friends and Jill, and approaches Rosa with an offer: he and the team will hit Vegas for another attempt before the casinos install [[biometric software]] that will quickly identify card counters, as long as Rosa, once a very successful "big player", also plays. Disguised, the team returns to [[Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino|Planet Hollywood]] and wins $640,000 before fleeing Williams and his men, chips in hand. Ben and Rosa split up, with Rosa taking the bag of chips. Rosa escapes into a limousine with the intention of stealing the winnings, but finds his bag is full of [[chocolate coins]] and that the casino manager is driving Rosa's limousine. It is revealed that Ben and Williams made a deal in which Ben would be allowed to come back to Vegas for one night in exchange for Rosa, against whom Williams has a grudge: Years ago, Williams was a [[pit manager]] when Rosa took his casino for over $1,000,000 by counting cards, resulting in Williams being fired. After capturing Rosa, Williams confronts Ben and demands at gunpoint the bag of chips for his retirement; after giving up the money, Ben rejoins his friends, who have been counting all night themselves. The film closes with Ben recounting the entire tale to a "dazzled" Harvard director.

He finds her day planner in the cab they shared. Meanwhile, Jane's sister Tess ([[Malin Åkerman]]) arrives from Europe and falls in love with Jane's boss George ([[Edward Burns]]) at first sight. Tess pretends to like the same things that George does to get him to like her. Despite being in love with George herself, Jane does not reveal the truth and her sister's courtship progresses rapidly. Soon the new couple announce that they intend to marry in three weeks and Jane becomes the wedding planner.  The reporter who agrees to post their wedding turns out to be Kevin, who writes wedding announcements under the name Malcolm Doyle. After looking at the contents of Jane's planner, he decides to use the contents as material for a piece on the "perpetual bridesmaid" and hopefully be promoted to writing investigative pieces about the real news.  Jane is unaware of Kevin's intentions. When he asks to interview her for his column on Tess, he gets her to try on all 27 bridesmaids dresses in her closet. He takes pictures of her in all of them and sends them with the completed article to his boss. As they get to know each other, Kevin begins to think that Jane is not as one-dimensional as he thought and asks his editor to hold his article so he can "fix" it.  When Kevin finds out that Jane is getting her sister's marriage fixed with the man she loves, he rebukes her. Jane agrees to one drink with Kevin and ends up getting drunk. Kevin and Jane kiss and have sex in the car. The next morning, the two go to a diner and a waitress recognizes Jane. Kevin's editor ran the article on the front page of the 'Commitments' section, despite Kevin and her settling to hold it for a while. When Jane finds out about it, she feels betrayed and is furious at him. Tess then gets angry at Jane for giving Kevin material about ''her'', whom he describes as a [[wiktionary:bridezilla|bridezilla]]. The fight escalates when Jane sees that Tess altered their late mother's wedding dress to her own style — the last straw on Tess' string of lies to George and demands on Jane.  Despite the fight, Tess asks Jane to make a [[slideshow]] for her engagement party. Jane decides that George should know the truth about Tess and shows pictures of Tess with other men, eating ribs (as she claimed that she is a vegan, like George), holding a cat by the tail, and recoiling from George's dog (she told him that she loves dogs, but actually hates them) — in short, doing all the things she had told George that she never did. After that, Pedro, the child George mentors, tells the crowd that Tess had him clean George's apartment for money. George breaks off the engagement. Jane's friend, Casey([[Judy Greer]]), points out that telling the truth to George and breaking their engagement at the party didn't help the situation, and that it would have been better if she had been upfront with him in the beginning. The next day, Jane meets Tess to apologize. She is still mad with Jane, as Tess believes that Jane resented her throughout the years. Tess reveals that the reason she stayed in New York was because she got fired from her job and her boyfriend dumped her; she explains that when she met George she'd tried to be like Jane since she fell in love with him. Tess also encourages Jane to focus on her life and her own needs, rather than becoming a pushover for all of her friends by bending over backwards for their every desire.  Later at work, George tells Jane that he appreciates her because she never says no. Remembering that Kevin once said the same thing as a criticism, Jane quits and admits she only stayed at the job because she was in love with George. She discovers after an experimental kiss that she no longer loves him and goes to meet Kevin. She announces in front of a crowd at a wedding he is covering that she is in love with him.  One year later Jane and Kevin are getting married. George and Tess meet again and a hope for a second chance shows. All 27 brides whom Jane helped, as well as Tess and Casey, are her bridesmaids, wearing the dresses she once wore as their bridesmaid.

 On a remote island, a rare creature known as the Blonde Buffalo attempts to flee in an escape raft but is cut off by the island's owner Cachirula de los Cachirulos, her assistant Wool Star, and an army of dolls. Cachirula grieves that she is both despised by the rare creatures she keeps on the island and that she is still missing the most valuable animal of all: Juanín. A smuggler named Tío Pelado arrives to console Cachirula that he has encountered the last remaining Juanín in existence, and upon showing her a photo of it, is commanded to retrieve it.  In mainland Chile, Juanín is the producer of the news program 31 Minutos, headed by bumbling anchor Tulio Triviño, who is celebrating his birthday. Juanín has arranged a special celebration and gift for Tulio, but fears that if anything goes wrong, he will be fired and will be alone. Tío Pelado overhears this and plans to vandalize Juanín's gift, a large portrait of Tulio. Meanwhile, Juanín checks in with the other employees at the studio for the celebration: reporters Patana and Ernesto Felipe Mario Hugo (or Mario Hugo for short), commentator Policarpo, and journalist Juan Carlos Bodoque. Upon Tulio's arrival, the show begins a live broadcasting of the celebration, culminating in the unveiling of Tulio's portrait, which Tío Pelado has repainted to display Tulio sitting on a toiled and labeled "Idiot." Tulio, upset by the humiliating image, fires Juanín, who gathers his things and leaves. After his departure, the news crew finds security footage of Tío Pelado altering Tulio's portrait, which they deduce means Juanín is innocent. As they set out to find him, Juanín has already been tricked by Tío Pelado to come to Cachirula's island.  Captive on Tío Pelado's shipping boat, Juanín befriends a small bug named Vicho who reveals to him the cruel nature of Cachirula's rare animal collection. At the docks, a guilt-ridden Tulio rallies the news cast in an attempt to rescue Juanín by using his private yacht to pursue him but they are instead trapped in the Sea of Great Winds. Unaware of his friends' rescue attempt and feeling betrayed, Juanín accepts Cachirula's hospitality upon arrival to the island and is instructed that he never has to work again, there he meets and befriends a Huachimingo. While still trapped, the news crew receive a televised transmission of Cachirula announcing her completed animal collection and Juanín's disgust of his friends, but Juan Carlos protests the true intentions of Cachirula are to fill her private zoo and strip the animals of their freedom. In an attempt to keep Juanín from his friends' rescue, Cachirula disposes of Tío Pelado as the only remaining witness.  During a storm, Juan Carlos is thrown overboard and lost at sea, after which the boat and remaining news crew are swallowed by a whale where they find Tío Pelado. To escape the whale, Pelado fills it with smoke which results in the crew being expelled onto the shores of Cachirula's island.  Meanwhile, Juan Carlos is captured by Huachimingo's tribe and tries to kill him for supposedly kidnapping the Huachimingo that is in Cachirula's collection, having been convinced by Guaripolo that he is Tío Pelado, bit Juan Carlos shows them a picture of Tío Pelado and is set free. Juan Carlos then explains where Huachimingo could be.  Bored of his new lifestyle, Juanín attempts to make his own show by recording the other animals with the help of Huachimingo, but is reprimanded by Cachirula for working. Cachirula reminds Juanín of his friends' abandonment just as Wool Star discovers the crew on their beach. Tulio arrives at Cachirula's doorstep and unsuccessfully tries to convince Juanín to return to the studio with him.  As Tulio returns to the beach and informs the rest of the crew, Juan Carlos arrives with Huachimingo's lost tribe via several boats. Juanín, moved by Tulio's apology, explores an off-limits area to find the mounted head of the Blonde Buffalo, convincing him of Cachirula's evil intentions and sparking him to incite revolt among the other animals. As Cachirula detains Juanín, she informs him that she has decided to decapitate and mount all of the animals' heads. Huachimingo escapes through a sewer pipe and informs the news crew of Cachirula's plans. After Cachirula refuses to release the animals, the news crew declares war and a battle ensues between the news crew, aided by the species that suffered Cachirula's kidnappings, and Cachirula's army,  while Tulio, Juan Carlos and Huachimingo go to save Juanin. Meanwhile, Cachirula released an army of robots to kill the crew, but the battle ends up being won by the news crew as Vicho arrives with help. They arrive in time to save Juanín and release the remaining animals, but Cachirula re-captures Juanin and launches him to a cliff as Tulio jumps to save him, but they are saved by the whale that swallowed them before. Vowing revenge, Cachirula and Wool Star flee in their hovercraft, but it malfunctions and explodes.  As the characters celebrate their victory over Cachirula, Juan Carlos expresses his interest in staying with the Huachimingos, but he quickly regrets it upon learning that their spots aren't natural, but being in reality tattoos. Later, all the characters dance to music while Mario Hugo searches for Patana.  In a brief post-credits scene, the worker that Tío Pelado replaced wakes up and realized that all is a plot to kidnap Juanin, and goes to stop it.

The film begins in 1998, when Reno has purportedly perfected [[time travel]] technology. The SEALs use it to travel backwards to the year 112,000,000 BC (despite the movie's title) of the [[Early Cretaceous]], in order to rescue a previous, 1949 expedition led by Reno's brother Erik ([[Christopher Atkins]]).  Reno's team arrives in [[Laurasia]] six years after the 1949 team arrived, to find only a few survivors. The SEAL team is ill-equipped for the dangers of this prehistoric period, and is decimated by a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' and other prehistoric life.  Having accomplished their mission, remnants of the two teams merge into one and return to the present, but in the process the anomaly malfunctions, allowing the subadult, ,  ''Tyrannosaurus'' to travel to the present and wreak havoc in rural [[Los Angeles]]. Reno stays behind, ostensibly to close the portal, but instead transports himself to the year 1950 after being cornered by the dinosaur.  Apparently he tried to leap through the portal as it closed, but was sent to 1950 instead of 1998.  In the present, survivors of the team run through the Suburbs of Los Angeles, barely evading the rampaging prehistoric beast. Meanwhile, in 1950, the wounded Dr. Reno arrives and meets up with the younger version of himself.

Young Dr. Reno assembles a strike team of soldiers and leads them through the portal to 1998, where they attempt to rescue the remainder of the original team from the rampaging dinosaur.  Young Reno then has to find a means of luring the creature back into the anomaly and returning it to its own time, before it takes the life of his brother from him once more.  Finally the dinosaur is banished back to its time where the trip fuses it with a mountain, killing it. Frank opens a portal to 1950 for everyone to return home through.  Frank and one of the rescued team members plan to start a relationship. Someone needs to stay behind to close the portal, Erik does, his lover Betty staying with him.

Now the third architect who is brought in, Arjun Singh, is a religious, true devotee of lord Hanumaan and devoted to his family; but he is also in love with Lisa.

This projected movie roughly reveals the story of a couple of street performers in love and tortured by a lustful [[Zamindar]] ([[Prakash Raj]]), who tonsures the girl's head.

Later, Muthu accompanies her to investigate what really happens. It leads to an old retired schoolmaster, who narrates the story of the dropped movie. In the later 1970s, this movie was actually made by an enthusiastic young director Gnanasekaran ([[Cheran (director)|Cheran]]), and dropped midway due to a mishap.

Meanwhile, the real Zamindar's son ([[Seeman (director)|Seeman]]) comes to the shooting spot and objects, stating that the real incident maligning his dad should not be canned.

Manimekhala suddenly wields a camera and becomes a docu film maker and goes to the particular village again. There she meets the real Dalit woman ([[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]]), who was tonsured during the Zamindar's period, and interviews her.

These last words haunt Sathya, and filled with remorse, he vows to carry on Udayamoorthy's good work.  He gathers evidence to discover Leelavathi's murder, even as VBR burns the documents to destroy the evidence. Sathya continues with his task of exposing VBR, and adopts [[Gandhian]] principles of nonviolence and peaceful satyagraha.

He thinks that Sathya had killed him, although he later finds out that he didn't. Sathya sits near the Gandhi statue and follows his examples of nonviolence, confident that VBR will be arrested.

To their horror, they partly uncover the body of a young girl and beside her is a small Canadian flag, implying she is a Canadian backpacker.  After an aborted attempt at reporting the body to the police, they search for the presumed killer from Mark's knowledge of the vehicle as he saw it driving away from the forest. They place the Canadian flag on his four-wheel drive and then the two boys secretly enter his house. They find out his name is Ian Wright and see a picture of him with a woman and baby, presumably his wife and child. They later phone him and try to blackmail him into killing Gary Parker.

Ace of Hearts (2008 film)
 The film is about a [[Police dog|K-9 dog]] named Ace. The police are trying to catch a burglar whom they have nicknamed "Goliath". Out on a call, the police and their dogs are on the track of the thief, Torco (Dopud). After a pursuit in the woods, Ace takes down Torco, out of sight of his human partner, Dan (Cain), who soon arrives. When police see injuries to Torco's neck, they believe they are the results of Ace biting him. And Torco does not face charges as the evidence against him is sketchy. Officials demand Ace be euthanized because he's now classified as 'a biter'. Dan drives Ace to the vet hospital in [[Spokane]], and leaves him to be put down.  Dan goes to the capture scene and sees the area is under 24-hour video surveillance. He also finds a piece of barbed wire, which he believes Torco used to slash himself with. Dan tries to convince his captain that Ace is innocent and to stop the euthanasia, but to no avail. The surveillance video is being 'cleaned up' by technicians. Meanwhile Ace has trickily escaped the vet hospital, and heads home. The veterinary technician, not wanting to have his incompetence found out, puts some other ashes from the crematory into a container and marks them as Ace's.  Dan tries to get over the grief of losing Ace by trying out other dogs, but to no success. Ace, while making his way back to Dan, captures a petty-thief and is lauded by the media. Dan's daughter, Julia (McKillip), sees Ace on a TV news show, but her parents do not believe it is Ace, since his supposed cremated remains are just then delivered to their home by mail. But Julia eventually convinces Dan to take her to [[Wenatchee]] to see if the dog is Ace. When they arrive Ace has just escaped again. During their drive back home, sleepy Julia sees Ace, who has hopped into the back of a towed car. Ace sees her and waves, which is a trick she taught him. But Dan 'convinces' Julia she was probably just dreaming, and they proceed home.  Dan's police captain brings him in to show him the surveillance tape of the capture. It shows Torco first fending off Ace with barbed wire, but then slashing himself with it. Dan was right all along, and he is upset with the captain. Meanwhile, Julia stakes out Torco's house since she, too, believes he framed Ace. But while looking around, she 'accidentally' breaks in, and then finds incriminating evidence. Torco comes home from work early and sees Julia leaving. After entering his house he discovers evidence that Julia had been inside. Torco goes to Julia's house.   After Julia returns home, as she tells her mother (Loder) about Torco, the two of them are pursued by Torco, but Ace comes to the rescue just-in-time, and brings down Torco. But Torco stabs Ace with a piece of broken glass. Dan arrives home and Torco is arrested. Ace is taken to a vet hospital and will recover. Dan then allows Julia to take Ace to the K-9 competition, where Ace wins first place. While Julia plays with Ace in the family's backyard, Dan agrees to take his wife to Tahiti, for their long-ago 'postponed' honeymoon, and the [[end credits]] roll.

Sam is later on a bus and witnesses two occupants give their seat up to a woman. He also sees another man staring at him. Later, when he visits Trife's grave at Oak Park cemetery, the man he saw earlier sits next to him. He says his name is Jehvon and starts a conversation with him. Later in the conversation, the man brings up the murder and attacks Sam. He turns out to be Trife's cousin, and he wounds Sam. However, Sam is later able to gain control of the fight and beats him into submission. Trife's cousin informs him that he will not survive the day, as many people want him dead – and will stop at nothing, not even harming his family. Sam, troubled by these claims, goes to his house and breaks in. However, no one is home, so Sam bandages up his wound. He then has a flashback to his prison days which reveals he helped a high ranking prison mate escape an attack from Trife's uncle, Curtis.  Sam then goes into a room, goes through the drawers and picks up a gun which he discards, then leaves. As Sam later visits Claire and asks for information regarding his mother, he says he won't hurt her, however Claire says she hasn't seen his mother in over a year, and also tells him that Mooney is at university, and that that's all she knows. Then Claire's partner Hayden arrives, and attacks Sam when he realises who he is, berating him for all the emotional damage he caused Claire six years ago. Sam then visits Mooney and asks for information regarding anyone who might hurt his family. He says he has changed, however Mooney reveals that he should be wary of Jay as he has changed for the worse. He also tells him that Sam inspired him to study Law, so he can make sure people like him do not go free in 6 years. Sam then speaks to Becky's cousin Lexi, hoping that she might have some information.  The scene then shifts to Omen, with Dabs and Henry robbing a car in broad daylight. They take what they have stolen to Ike's house to sell and are given money by Ike, who leaves to sort out some business. It is revealed that his partner is Andreas, whose face was cut in the first film by Trife. Ike tells a customer that even Andreas had to learn the hard way. Andreas remarks that he got what he deserved, as he tested Curtis's patience and suffered the consequences. Then Ike burns his customer's arm and beats him up to teach him a lesson for making money behind his back on his gear. Jay is later seen selling drugs to customers, however when a rich one tests him, Jay robs him and his fiancée and humiliates him. Just then he receives a call from Jehvon informing him that Sam is out, so he lets the rich man and his fiancée go. He goes to Ike's house, seeking help about Sam, so Ike gives him a gun. Then Andreas suggests hiring some of the teenagers to kill Sam. Dabs is called into the room and eventually agrees to do it for £6,000.  Jay makes it clear that the others must not see Sam's face when the murder happens. Dabs tells Henry about the plan. Not willing to kill a man, Henry tells Dabs not to go through with it. A scuffle happens and Dabs hits Henry over the head with a brick. Later, Dabs and Blammy meet Omen and tell him about the job. Omen agrees after Dabs lies and says that the target was the one who hurt Henry. Sam and Lexi meet and Sam learns that she was gang raped years ago, which led her into drug addiction because as they are having sex she pushes him away. As he gets up she sees various scars on his back and it is revealed they were given to him by Trife's uncle as revenge and when Lexi touches them he leaves in anger. Jay meets with Mooney and his girlfriend Kayla in a café and tells Robert that he could have prevented Trife's death, convincing him to help Jay track down Sam. But shortly afterwards, Robert tells Jay that he needs to move on.  Later, the teenage hit-men see Sam walking through a park and tackle him to the ground. With Sam's face to the floor, Dabs tells Omen to stab him, but Omen insists on seeing his face first. It is then revealed that Omen is Sam's brother. He refuses to kill his own brother, and realises that Dabs knew who it was. Sam is about to kill Dabs, but has a flashback to the murder and relents, just punching Dabs and leaving with the two teenagers. Meanwhile, Jay goes round to Lexi's flat and we find out he is her dealer, and that Lexi was setting up Sam by bringing him back to her flat. Sam phones the man he spoke to outside the prison and asks for the favour the man promised him earlier in the film. Sam walks down a street and mugs a couple at gunpoint, but apologises for doing it.  He uses the stolen phone to call the police about an armed robbery, telling them the criminal is going into the house he is about to enter. Using the items he stole, he goes into Ike's house pretending to want to sell them. Meanwhile, Sam's contact phones Curtis and tells him where Sam is. While Sam is holding them all at gun point, the armed police show up and arrest Ike, Andreas, and Curtis, but Sam escapes. On the way home, Sam is attacked by Jay. Jay holds him at gunpoint and a fight ensues but during the fight Sam realises that Jay is just like he was six years ago and cannot bring himself to commit murder. Safe in the knowledge that Jay is not really dangerous, he leaves the fight.  As all this happens, Sam, having nowhere to go, wanders aimlessly through the streets. He finds that Lexi has left a message on his phone asking him to spend time with her, and makes his way to her flat. He struggles to get there due to all the injuries he received during the past day, though he manages to make it to Lexi's flat, and the two smile as he enters.  
The Admiral (2008 film)
 The film opens during the production of ''[[War and Peace (film series)|War and Peace]]'' at [[Mosfilm Studios]] in 1964. An elderly [[Russian nobility|Russian noblewoman]] is set to appear as a [[film extra]] until her past comes to light. Although the film's [[political commissar]] demands her dismissal since she is a "wife of an enemy of the revolution", director [[Sergei Bondarchuk]] is adamant that he needs faces like hers for the production. As the commissar realises the difficulty of identifying her using the file he has, he immediately recognises the elderly woman behind him as the woman he is searching for, while the elderly woman is looking at her own 1910s photo.  The film flashes back to the [[Baltic Sea]] in 1914. [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Alexander Kolchak]] ([[Konstantin Khabensky]]) is laying [[naval mines]] from his ship in German territorial waters when he runs across [[SMS Friedrich Carl]], an [[armoured cruiser]] of the [[German Imperial Navy]]. As chaos reigns on his ship, Kolchak sights in one of the guns and succeeds in seriously damaging the bridge of the German vessel. This buys him only a brief respite, however.  Realising that the enemy ship is blocking his line of escape, Kolchak informs his men that the only way to return to safety is to lure the Germans onto one of his mines. As the ship steams into the mines they have just laid, Kolchak leads his men in [[Russian Orthodox]] prayers for [[God]]'s protection. Although they barely avoid hitting their own mines, the German ship is not so lucky and sinks with almost all hands (in reality, the vessel sank slowly and most of the crew were saved).  Later, at their naval base in the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], now promoted to [[rear admiral]], Kolchak is introduced to [[Anna Timireva]] ([[Elizaveta Boyarskaya]]), the wife of his subordinate officer and close friend Captain Sergei Timirev. The strong attraction between them immediately becomes apparent. Although Sergei reminds his wife that they took vows before God, Anna is unmoved and wants nothing more than to be with the Admiral.  Although terrified of losing him, Sofia Kolchak ([[Anna Kovalchuk]]) offers to leave for [[Petrograd]] and let her husband be with Anna if he so desires. The Admiral, however, firmly tells her, "You are my wife and I am your husband. That is how it always shall be."  His feelings for Anna continue to grow, however. When she approaches him to deliver a love letter, Kolchak informs her that they cannot ever meet again. When Anna demands to know why, the Admiral responds, "Because I love you."  Later, he is informed that the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]] ([[Nikolai Burlyayev]]) has promoted him to [[vice admiral]] in command of the [[Black Sea]] [[Black Sea Fleet|Fleet]] at [[Sevastopol]]. After receiving a last minute letter from Kolchak, Anna rushes to the train station to see off her beloved. She is too late, however, and experiences only an uncomfortable look from Sofia.  After the [[February Revolution]] in 1917, officers are disarmed and [[summary execution|summarily executed]] at the [[Kronstadt]] [[naval base]]. Sergei barely escapes the island with Anna. Meanwhile, a group of enlisted men, now with their [[cockade]]s on their [[sailor cap]]s changed from a Tsarist insignia to a red revolutionary cockade,  arrive aboard Kolchak's flotilla in Sevastopol and demand that all officers surrender their arms. To avoid bloodshed, Kolchak orders his subordinates to obey. However, he throws his own sword into the harbour rather than hand it over, but the sailors didn't complain about it.  Later, Kolchak is summoned to Petrograd by [[Alexander Kerensky]] ([[Viktor Verzhbitsky]]), who offers to appoint him Minister of Defence. Kolchak, however, sharply criticises Kerensky for promoting indiscipline in both the Russian Army and Navy. He states that the only way he will accept is if he is given a free hand to restore old practices. Kerensky, enraged by Kolchak's "[[counterrevolutionary]] sympathies," exiles him to the [[United States]], excusing that "the allies need more experts".  In the late summer of 1919, almost two years after the [[October Revolution]], Anna and Sergei Timiriov are travelling on the [[Trans-Siberian Railroad]] when she learns that Kolchak has returned and is leading a detachment of the [[anti-communist]] [[White Army]] at [[Omsk]]. Sergei does not want to get actively involved with either side in the civil war, and is dismayed when she returns to their carriage and announces that she is leaving him. After commenting about what a year of Revolution it has been, Sergei helps Anna to pack her things.  After hearing Kolchak's speeches to his troops about defeating the [[Bolsheviks]] and "restoring Russia," Anna is deeply moved and goes to work as a nurse among the wounded of the [[Russian Civil War]]. Meanwhile, Kolchak is informed that the [[Red Army]] is advancing on Omsk, assisted by sympathizers behind White lines. Although his advisors all suggest defending Omsk to the last, Kolchak decrees that they will instead evacuate Omsk and seize [[Irkutsk]] as the new capital of anti-communist Russia.  During the evacuation of Omsk, Anna is recognised by a White officer who informs Kolchak. Deeply moved, the Admiral goes to her and announces that, although he made the mistake of leaving her once, he will never do so again. As the train steams toward Irkutsk, Kolchak informs Anna that he has written to his wife Sofia, who now lives in [[Paris]], and formally asked for a [[divorce]]. Although he asks Anna to marry him, she insists that there is no need of marriage and that what matters is that they are together now. Eventually, she relents and they are seen attending the [[Divine Liturgy]] together.  Meanwhile, Irkutsk is under the nominal control of the French General [[Maurice Janin]] and the [[Czechoslovak Legions]]. With their defences disintegrating, the Red Army offers them only one way out alive. As a result, General Janin agrees to hand over Admiral Kolchak.  As a massive land force of White soldiers rides and marches toward Irkutsk, Kolchak is placed under arrest by the Czechs and handed over to the Reds. Despite Kolchak's attempts to shield her, Anna insists that, as his wife, she must be arrested, too.  Kolchak is given a cursory trial by the Irkutsk [[soviet (council)|soviet]] and executed with his former Prime Minister by a [[firing squad]] along the banks of the frozen [[Angara River]]. His last words are, "Send word to my wife in Paris that I bless our son". His body is then dumped into a hole drilled into the ice by the local Orthodox clergy for the [[Great Blessing of Waters]] on [[Epiphany (holiday)#Eastern Orthodox Christian churches|Theophany]].  The film then returns to the present, 44 years later at the Mosfilm Studios. It is revealed that Anna - now in her 70s and identified as the elderly noblewoman - survived more than 30 years in the [[Gulag]] and was only released during the [[Khrushchev thaw]]. Anna Timiorova witnesses a rehearsal for one of the ballroom scenes from ''War and Peace'', as she accidentally bumps into an actor playing as a waiter, breaking a glass of wine, which reminds her of the first time she meets Kolchak, then the film shifts to her imagination as she dreams of the formal dance she was never able to share with her beloved. ===Epilogue=== The fates of the film's main characters are then revealed in an epilogue: *Anna Vasilyevna Timiryova was arrested numerous times following Admiral Kolchak's execution, and survived nearly 40 years in the Gulag before being released in 1960.

Aegan
 ''Aegan'''s story is based around Shiva ([[Ajith Kumar]]), a CB-CID officer, and his efforts to foil the terrorist John Chinnappa ([[Suman (actor)|Suman]]). Shiva is simultaneously attempting to mend relations with his father's estranged first wife and his half-brother Narain ([[Navdeep]]). Complications ensue.  John is a scientist who had created tablets by operating on human [[guinea pig]]s. His ploys have always been controversial but inconclusive due to the lack of witnesses. However, an ex-gang member General Ram Prasad ([[Devan (actor)|Devan]]) became a [[Informant|police approver]] and is on the verge of revealing John's ploys to the police. However, he is on the run to avoid charges. The case falls to Commissioner Karthikeyan ([[Nassar]]), Shiva's father, who assigns his son to go and help solve the mission.  Karthik tells Shiva to attend college in [[Tamil Nadu]] – St. John's College, [[Ooty]] – to protect Ram Prasad's daughter Pooja ([[Piaa Bajpai]]) from meeting with her father. Shiva pleads that he has never undertaken this type of a mission before and doesn't know much about the current generation. Ram Prasad points out that by a strange coincidence, Pooja attends school in the same town where Ram Prasad is hiding. Shiva can protect Pooja and look for Ram Prasad at the same time. Shiva goes undercover as a student returning to college after many years away taking care of the family business. He is much older than the other students, who at first make fun of him because of his lack of new-generation styles. He also has to deal with the many goofy teachers as well the idiotic forgetful principal of the college, Albert ([[Jayaram]]).  He finds Narain, who is later revealed to be Shiva's brother. Pooja is Narain's best friend and he is secretly jealous that other girls can get his attention but she can't. Shiva saves Pooja from John's men who kidnap her, while Narain and others think it's a prank. He later becomes a sensation among the students and teachers. He befriends Narain and Pooja and falls in love with the chemistry teacher Mallika ([[Nayanthara]]), after being attracted by her beauty and in a bid to convince other students that he is one of them. During his regular jogging sessions, Shiva spots Ram Prasad and chases him till he escapes with the help of a helmet-clad bike rider who is later revealed to be Narain. Pooja comes to know that Narain has been helping her father and feels cheated by him.  Narain tries to apologise to Pooja many times, but she refuses to talk to him. Irked by this, Narain drinks and explains his actions when John's men come again to kidnap Pooja. They beat up Narain, but Shiva comes to their rescue. Narain and Pooja patch up after the fight sequences. Shiva takes Narain to his home where he learns that Narain is his brother and meets his mother. The flashback sequences describe Shiva's childhood (he is an orphan) and explain why his mother and father live separately.  The next day when Pooja introduces Ram Prasad to Shiva, Shiva arrests him, much to Pooja and Narain's disappointment. Then, everyone in the college, including Mallika learns that Shiva is a policeman. Shiva then drives Ram Prasad straight to John's hiding place, avoiding the traps that he had set. A fight ensues between Shiva and John's men in which John is finally killed.  In the final scenes, Mallika is shown with Shiva's parents and brother, while he has gone to Afghanistan as part of another mission.  
Adventures of Power
 The story takes place in the fictional small town of Lode, [[New Mexico]], where just about all of the male townsfolk work for a copper mining plant, including Power (Gold). Power (whose name was given to him by his father so he could grow up strong) lives with his Aunt Joanie (Lynch) and is always shown air-drumming to music, even when at work.  It turns out he air-drums because his father never could afford to buy him drums.  He does his air-drumming at a talent show in a local bar, where his only praise comes from a young boy. Unfortunately, the mining plant is poised to strike, but Power is fired for a mishap that is one too many just beforehand, therefore he cannot join in.  Disappointed, he stumbles upon an ad for an underground air-drumming place about forty miles south of them just across the border in Mexico.  The boy lends him his dirt bike to get there, but he ends up losing it while there.  He joins in, playing a Rush song without sitting down, which makes him nearly pass out.  When the police raid the place, he ducks everyone and gets away.  Before heading back, he is given an invitation to join a group of air-drummers in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]], so armed with his music and cereal, he hitchhikes his way to Newark.  Once he gets there, he meets the crew, headed by Carlos, a former drummer who now has hooks in place of both of his hands (it is never explained why), and he is given a job and a place to crash at a local Chinese restaurant owned by Michael Fong (Ling).  Living upstairs from the restaurant is Samantha, a religious fanatic, and her deaf daughter, Annie (Stern).  Annie does take an initial liking to Power, but her mother objects to it, and even eventually threatens to move to Florida when she catches them making out.  Before doing so, Annie reveals that her mother used to be a groupie, and she went deaf in her youth from not wearing hearing protection while on stage with the bands. (A picture she shows Power has her at a very young age on stage next to an amp crying.)  A subplot involves a rich young guy called Dallas Houston (or Dallas H.) who does music videos and has his own product lines of every sorts.  He has a secret admiration for air-drumming that his father, who happens to own the mining company that runs the Lode plant, abhors.  Power works hard with the new crew for the upcoming air-drumming competition, eventually overcoming his shortcomings, but when he finds out the striking miners were assaulted by hired thugs and his dad is hospitalized, he bails on them and calls him, and they seem to make amends.  Carlos decides the group must go on without Power, but as they are performing their group song, one of the members is disqualified for how he’s playing, which causes the others to start a fight and gets them DQed as well.  Power, who comes in just in time for the solo competition, is the only one left eligible on their team.  He plays along with Dallas H. and another female to [[Tom Sawyer (song)|Tom Sawyer]] in the finals.  The girl drops out early, and after Power’s defective stool breaks and leaves him flat on the floor, it seems as though he would be out as well.  However, he finds out Annie is in the crowd at the show when she tosses a [[Cheerios|Cheerio]] on stage right into his mouth. (She had earlier declared to her mother she couldn’t go to Florida, and her mother, in sudden understanding, gives her a ticket to the air-drumming competition and says “Maybe [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] was a rockstar.”)  With renewed energy, Power jumps up and continues playing without a stool (much to Carlos’s worry) and outlasts Dallas to win the competition.  He is presented the $2000 grand prize by [[Rush (band)|Rush]] drummer [[Neil Peart]] (in a cameo appearance) and has him make the check out to the workers union of the copper plant.  Power’s dad, renewed by his son’s victory and generosity, helps to resume fighting.

The viewer cannot see her death but only hear her cries slowly subside. This is all caught on a video camera Robert was using for a school project. The girls die. An atmosphere of paranoia and unease sets in among students and teachers, Robert being affected as well. The school claims that the drugs were bought outside the school and enforces a new, much harsher, drug policy wherein bags are searched and students are expelled. Robert and another student, Amy ([[Addison Timlin]]), are assigned to make a memorial video. The school is not happy with the result and has it re-edited, to make a smoother version.  While making the video, Robert and Amy begin a romantic relationship, wherein they both have sex for the first time in a wooded area. However, it is later hinted that their roommate may be involved romantically, as well. He fights with his roommate, who sold the drugs to the twins, and shouts that he killed the girls. The school questions him about this accusation, and is relieved that Robert says it was not substantiated. Robert is asked to take a leave of absence from the school. Toward the end of the film, we are finally shown the scene of the girls' deaths from the front and see Robert pressing his hand over her mouth and nose, smothering her.

When he identifies a woman as one of "them", she tries to escape but is shot down. Meanwhile, a police officer, who was also inside the store, manages to kill one of the masked men. He then calls for back-up and shoots Spooky, who hasn't managed to check all hostages yet. The cop is then killed too.  As the police arrive, the group argues whether or not to leave, but their leader, a man named Ritter, tells them that they need to finish their job. They release the hostages Spooky already managed to clear and move the rest to the back of the store. As they inspect one of the corpses, it becomes clear that the person was infected with an organism that breeds inside the person. With Spooky dead, the group resorts to a different method for checking whether the rest of the people are infected or not. One by one, the hostages are taken to another room and have one of their fingers cut off, which Sterling, the doctor of the group, uses to verify if they are infected or not.  Outside the store a policeman named Seth, whose stepdaughter Whitney works as a cashier at the store, takes charge of the police operation. They discover that Ritter used to work as a rocket scientist and that the group hunts people that are infected with an alien parasite that came to Earth inside a meteorite, which the cops don't believe. Trying to negotiate with Ritter, they come to the agreement that Ritter will release one of the hostages if the police bring them a woman named Charlotte, who used to be part of the group and possesses the same ability as Spooky did.  The group inside discovers another woman is infected and kill her. They are then attacked by the revived body of the cop, who manages to kill two of the captors and three of the hostages. Ritter then explains to the remaining hostages what they were after: The parasites are divided in two groups, several females and one king. Without the king, the parasites would eventually go extinct. They knew that one of the persons inside the store was the host of the king, which is why they took the whole store hostage.  Seth and Charlotte then come inside. With Charlotte's help, the group lures the infected cop into a trap, while Seth leads his stepdaughter and the store clerk named Benny, who volunteered to have his finger cut off to spare Whitney the ordeal, outside. Ritter manages to cut the living parasite out of the cop, but is subsequently gunned down by the police who try to kill it. Just as Sterling is arrested by Seth, Charlotte realizes that the killed parasite was not the king. Inside a police car, Benny overhears Seth calling the other cops, telling them that Benny must be the king. Benny realizes that it must actually be Whitney, since she was the only one who is still alive and wasn't checked by the captors. As he aims a gun at her, her eyes and veins change to a darker color and the screen fades to black, while Benny is heard screaming.

Ledge knocks her unconscious and drives to a remote spot near the [[Genesee River]] to drown her. Before Ledge can inject her with a sedative and dump her into the river, Megan breaks free and, after a struggle, shoots him in the foot with his own gun. Ledge falls into the river just past a large waterfall, though it's unclear if he is dead or not. Unsure whether Ledge is dead and confused by her surroundings, Megan is driven by the intense situation to another, longer breakdown.  Megan is again hospitalized and kept under intensive psychiatric care. The final scenes of the film show Megan heavily sedated and strapped to a bed in a psychiatric ward. There is no one else in the room, but in her state, she envisions the spirits of the victims waiting for her to return and seek justice for them.  The final scenes of Megan are intercut with scenes of a survived Ledge altering his appearance. He is shown in church, receiving [[Eucharist|communion]] and exchanging glances with a potential victim. It is unclear if these scenes of Ledge are actually occurring or are part of Megan's psychosis.  A title card announces: "In 2006, police exhumed a fireman's body and posthumously cleared him as a suspect. To date, the Alphabet Killer has not been found."

An American Carol
 [[Left wing politics|Left-wing]] activist and filmmaker Michael Malone ([[Kevin Farley]]), a parody of [[Michael Moore]], campaigns to end the celebration of the [[Fourth of July]] holiday. Malone holds pronounced anti-American views and truculently argues that America's past and present are both offensive, and therefore should not be celebrated.  On the evening of July 3, Malone watches a speech from President [[John F. Kennedy]] and mistakenly interprets the speech to mean avoiding war at any cost. President Kennedy rises out of the television set, corrects Malone regarding the intent of the speech, and informs him that he will be visited by three spirits.  The following morning, Malone is visited by General [[George S. Patton]] ([[Kelsey Grammer]]), who shows him an alternate United States where [[slavery]] still exists because [[Abraham Lincoln]] (founder of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]) chose not to fight the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Malone later sees [[George Washington]] ([[Jon Voight]]) who gives a passionate speech about God's gift of freedom and the price many people pay for others to have it. Malone is visited by the angel of death ([[Trace Adkins]]), who takes him to a future [[Los Angeles]] completely taken over by radical [[Islamism|Islamists]]. He is then taken to the ruins of his hometown in [[Michigan]], which has been destroyed by a [[nuclear bomb]] planted by [[Al Qaeda]]. In a mortuary, Malone learns that he will be killed in this attack, leaving nothing behind but his trademark hat and "big ass."  Facing his death, Malone pleads for his life with the Angel, promising to change. However, all is not well after Malone's revelation, for Aziz, a Middle Easterner he had interviewed, is actually a terrorist who will bomb a 4 July rally along with his underlings Ahmed and Fayed. However, when Fayed and Ahmed learn they are going to be detonated along with the planned bomb, they figure their slim chance of survival is by seeking out Malone.  Later, Malone arrives at an anti-Fourth of July protest rally and publicly renounces his former views. This triggers an outraged mob from which he is rescued, however, by American servicemen. Meeting up with Malone, Ahmed and Fayed defuse their own bomb, thus sparing the people at the anti-Independence Day rally and resulting in the capture of the terrorist Aziz. Safe inside a [[country music]] concert, the three are formally welcomed to "the real America" by Trace Adkins (this time as himself). A reformed Malone then goes to a Navy base to see his nephew Josh off to the [[Persian Gulf]]. He tells Josh how very proud he is of him and promises to look in on his wife and family during his deployment. In the final scene, Malone now decides to make films he feels people would appreciate, as well as Fayed and Ahmed as part of the crew, who have been pardoned for foiling the bombing. Malone is last seen working on a biographical film about President Kennedy.  
An American Affair
 Set in 1963, in the swirl of glamour and intrigue that turned [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] into Camelot, a young teenager, Adam Stafford ([[Cameron Bright]]) has an inside view of JFK’s torrid affair with his neighbor Catherine ([[Gretchen Mol]]) and secret CIA assassination plans. The assassination plan was influenced by a Cuban national in which America was having a revolutionary threat from Fidel Castro.  Catherine kept a diary which entries were about the secrets of the President. This diary was secretly stolen from Catherine by Adam Stafford when she fell asleep. The contents of this diary were the cause of her murder by the CIA, presumably.

AmericanEast
 Mustafa ([[Sayed Badreya]]) is a widowed Egyptian immigrant and the owner of Habibe's Café, a popular hangout in Los Angeles for those with Middle Eastern backgrounds. He is devoted to providing his son, [[Richard Chagoury]], with a moral upbringing despite the pressures of contemporary American urban life. He also finds himself cast in the role of protector to his unwed sister Salwah ([[Sarah Shahi]]), for whom, by family and tribal custom, he is responsible for finding a traditional suitor. But his respect for tradition comes up against his own aspirations to adapt to the American Dream when he decides to open a new restaurant with a Jewish partner – his friend Sam ([[Tony Shalhoub]]). This unholy alliance is unpopular amongst the habitués of his café and the insular Arab community in which Mustafa resides. It is one of several personal points of tension that gradually build against the backdrop of larger, national events affecting the Arab-American community and lead to the explosive denouement of the story.  Salwah, Mustaf's sister, must also reconcile her traditional values and familial obligations with new American realities. Although she is grateful to Mustafa for bringing her to America when she was young, and allowing her to pursue an education, conflict arises between them when Mustafa insists upon fulfilling his duty of finding her a traditional, arranged-marriage partner from Egypt. The arrival of this arranged suitor, her older cousin Saber ([[Al Faris (actor)|Al Faris]]), throws her life into turmoil and makes her question her own beliefs and faith. Secretly, she is attracted to an American, Dr. John Westerman ([[Tim Guinee]]), a young and attractive non-Muslim. Any caution she feels toward him, however, is thrown to the wind by the abrupt arrival of Saber and a possible impending marriage that she does not want. She becomes sorely tempted to experience intimacy with the young doctor outside of marriage, a taboo. While she undergoes this internal conflict, her suitor Saber is staying as a guest at the home she shares with Mustafa and his children, and the incompatibility between this traditional man, her future husband, and Mustafa's Americanized family is another source of irritation adding to the mounting tensions underlying the story.  Mustafa's friend Omar ([[Kais Nashef]]) is a struggling actor and Habibe's Café regular, a young Egyptian man who supports his dream of becoming a film star by working as a part-time cab driver for Mustafa's ragged, one-car taxi company. Because of his Middle Eastern looks and accent, however, he is constantly cast in the role of a terrorist in American TV shows that portray only a shallow understanding of Arabs and their culture. When an opportunity for a non-racially-designated role arrives, Omar feels his chance for success—to be seen as an actor first and not a Muslim—has finally arrived. It is the break he has been waiting for on many levels: a chance at the financial freedom necessary to marry and support his pregnant American girlfriend Kate ([[Amanda Detmer]]), and a chance for him, and his future child, to be embraced as an American, in the same way that he has embraced America.  But misunderstandings and prejudices related to his Arabic background conspire against him once again and his opportunity is lost, pushing Omar to make a drastic, unreasoned decision that sets off a chain of events leading to a violent conclusion that affects the lives and conflicts of all the other characters – an explosive reminder of the simmering pressures under which Muslims live in the United States today. Will their American Dreams be shattered by a climate of distrust and suspicion, or will their hopes and aspirations be embraced by their fellow Americans?

Even though Dee has no prior drug record and no drugs were found on her in the raid or any subsequent searches, she is offered a hellish choice: plead guilty and go home as a convicted felon or remain in prison and fight the charges, thus jeopardizing her custody and risking a long prison sentence for 18-24 years. Despite the urgings of her mother ([[Alfre Woodard]]), and with her freedom and the custody of her children at stake, she chooses to fight the district attorney. Dee works with an [[ACLU]] attorney ([[Tim Blake Nelson]]) and a former local narcotics officer ([[Will Patton]]) to take on the Texas justice system.<ref></ref>

Though he and Kiruba pass college with a first-class degree, Sathya has no interest in joining the police force like his father ([[M. S. Bhaskar]]). Kiruba studies hard to become a Sub-Inspector (SI), challenging Sathya to do the same. Just a day before the exam, Sathya decides to take up the exam as well, much to his friend's surprise and with little head start, passes the physical, written and interview, with the help of malpractices and influence from his uncle and becomes an SI.

Sathya gains fame by holding off knife-wielding men who come to kill an injured man at a hospital, though the man is killed later in the night. As a result, Sathya is drafted into a special task force (STF) to catch the gang members related to the crime. Daya and Logu carry out two kidnappings, raping the victims on both occasions, and releasing them for ransom money. Kiruba is beaten up by the police for a [[skirmish]] at the local bar; his father suffers a heart attack after getting his son back from the police station. At this point of time, Kiruba is employed by Daya, mainly because the former is distraught and will fall easily to the lure of money and booze.

The plot to kidnap the IG's daughters is an elaborate ruse to divert the police force to the south of the city while they escape from the north. The special task force, who are in the south of the city, realize the plot and upon learning that Sathya is alone in the north of the city, head in that direction.  In the sugarcane fields, Kiruba shows compassion towards the two girls, treating them softly. Upon hearing some noise in the field, Daya splits the group, doing so to meet up directly with Uthra who has the money-bag. He tries to rape her, but Sathya intervenes and a fist fight ensures, but the special task force comes upon them and kills Daya by setting it up as an encounter.  The two girls split and escape from the third accomplice, only for one of them to be recaptured by him, but is let off being too tiring to carry. Kiruba and the third accomplice try to run away, with Uthra behind him. Just as he leaves her to escape, she reveals that she is in love with Sathya and uses the situation to handcuff herself to Kiruba to avoid him from escaping. In the end, Sathya shoots Kiruba in self-defense and to save one of the IG's daughters from being shot. When Kiruba lies on Sathya's lap shot, Kiruba finds a ring he once gifted to Sathya on his birthday, which Kiruba believed thrown away by Sathya drunk while partying at the bar, which in turn wets Kiruba's eye and dies. The ending scenes of the film show Sathya and Uthra getting married and having a son, whom they name Kiruba.

The research project is led by Dr. Amanda Hayes and funded by Peter "J.D." Murdoch, a well-known industrialist. While visiting the facility, Murdoch provokes the anaconda with a large flashlight, and has it gassed to calm it down. However, as Murdoch, his assistant Pinkus and Daryl are about to leave, the anaconda kills Daryl and breaks through his enclosure's wall. As it escapes, it kills many of the people working in the laboratory. In looking through the facility, Amanda and the professor, realize that the anaconda also freed the queen anaconda.

 While on the highway, Shelby Leds and her boyfriend Rob pull over for gas, joined by a semi-truck and a Jeep. At the gas station, Shelby sees a frightened woman in the truck's back window, though Rob does not see her and tells Shelby that the trucker said he was driving alone. On the road, the same woman jumps from the truck and lands on their car. The truck continues onward as Shelby, Rob, and the driver of the Jeep stop to help the woman. Rob then drives after the truck to get its plates, but fails to catch up and returns only to discover the Jeep driver injured, with Shelby and the woman missing. The Jeep driver says the trucker took them, and they take the Jeep to an old, isolated house. The Jeep driver goes alone to the front door, where he overhears the trucker talking on the phone, claiming he is the woman's father and that he was taking her to a rehabilitation facility for a drug addiction. Meanwhile, in the Jeep, Rob discovers Shelby and the woman under a tarp in the backseat, bound and gagged. The Jeep driver kills the trucker when he goes out and then approaches the Jeep. Rob locks the door and tries to drive away, only to discover that the keys are missing. The Jeep driver then breaks open the window with his sledgehammer and kills Rob.  Elsewhere, Tabitha Wright is spending the night in her aunt's house to babysit her cousins, Max and Danny. She finds out that their babysitter, June, had already left, though she was supposed to wait for Tabitha to arrive before leaving. Later that evening, a man claiming to be June's boyfriend, Owen, arrives looking for her since she missed cheerleading practice. He leaves when Tabitha tells him she does not know where June is. While exploring the house, Tabitha finds the guest bedroom decorated with clown toys, and becomes particularly scared of a life-sized clown doll sitting on the rocking chair. She later talks with her aunt about the life-sized doll, but is told that the family has no such a doll. Tabitha and the boys are then attacked by the clown, who the boys insist is Owen. Tabitha helps the boys escape before hiding in the shed. Inside, she opens the closet and finds June's corpse. The clown enters the room, his laughter similar to the Jeep driver's.  Sometime earlier, Lisa Swan and her boyfriend Dan begin searching for her roommate Cat, who had disappeared during a party the night before. They go to an old hotel that Cat said she will be at. Lisa tries to get in, but the caretaker, a man whose face is covered by a face mask, refuses to let her in. She convinces Dan to pose as a health inspector and look inside. After letting him in, the caretaker shows Dan a music player and encourages him to play it, claiming there is a surprise in the end. Dan does so, and at the end of the song, a knife flies out of the speaker, stabbing him in the eye. Unable to get in contact with Dan, Lisa sneaks into the house and meets an apparently deaf man, who leads her to a room filled with beds that have dead bodies stuffed into the mattresses. Lisa finds Cat stuffed alive in one mattress, but as she attempts to free Cat, the deaf man attacks her, revealing himself to be the killer.  In a police interrogation room, Tabitha is revealed to be alive and in shock. When she does not answer the interrogator's questions, he leaves her alone. Tabitha then reminisces about her childhood, where she, Shelby, and Lisa were once all friends at Briar Hills Elementary School. After they were tasked to design miniature sets inside shoeboxes that can be viewed through peepholes, a male classmate demanded to see their work before showing his to Tabitha; it was of a rat chained up and its skin pulled back to reveal its organs. Tabitha is then interrogated by a therapist who asks her about Shelby and Lisa. When Tabitha says that they were all friends at Briar Hills Elementary, the therapist remembers a patient she once had who was from Briar Hills. Then, she comes to a realization and informs Tabitha that Lisa and Shelby are also here, before leaving to find a phone that works. Tabitha wanders out after her and discovers that she is not in a police station. She finds the therapist dead and sees the police interrogator, who was the killer all along, approaching.  Tabitha flees to the basement, where she finds herself trapped between two glass walls. Beyond either side, she finds Shelby and Lisa, bound and gagged and their skin pulled back similar to the rat in the boy's shoebox. The killer initially taunts them, but then reveals that the two are unharmed, and that their opened skin is just a trick. Just as the man is about to kill Shelby, Tabitha pretends to laugh, prompting him to open the glass wall and approach her. Tabitha then stabs him in the neck with a scalpel she had grabbed and unties her friends. As they try to escape, Lisa and Shelby are killed, while Tabitha climbs a ladder that leads to a barn shed. She hides in a room with props used to kidnap the three women as well as the dead bodies of other people the killer had murdered. The killer surprises her as he looks through a peephole, and reveals that she is in the back of a truck, which is by the same old house where Rob died. After he drives a short distance, the truck stalls. Tabitha takes hold a spiked weapon and, when he returns to look through the peephole again, stabs him through the face, killing him.  Tabitha restarts the truck and drives away, narrating about how she and her friends had laughed at the killer when they were young, thinking that he was a joke. After he was sent away, they had forgotten all about him, but he never forgot them. She then remarks that even though it was all over, she still cannot get his laugh out of her head.

April Fool's Day (2008 film)
 On April 1, 2007, Desiree Cartier is hosting a party at her mansion for her actress friend Torrance Caldwell. Present for a pre-festivities toast are—Blaine Cartier, Desiree's brother, who controls their joint inheritance (to Desiree's dislike), U.S. Senate candidate Peter Welling, Peter's "Miss Carolina" fiancée Barbie Reynolds, and the quintet's less wealthy videographer friend Ryan. With the party in full swing, Desiree's social nemesis and Ryan's not-so-secret crush Milan Hastings, arrives. Also present is chihuahua-toting society reporter Charles.  As another in her long string of April Fool's pranks, Desiree suggests Blaine get Milan tipsy on champagne and seduce her in his bedroom upstairs. Desiree and several of the others hover by the cracked-open bedroom door, prepared to videotape the affair with the camera Desiree lifted from Ryan. However, Milan has a seizure and falls off the balcony to her death. The group goes to court, and Blaine loses control of the family's fortune, which shifts to Desiree, but they are considered innocent and Milan's death is considered a fatal prank.  One year later, Desiree, Blaine, Peter, Barbie, Torrance, and Ryan receive anonymous invitations to meet on Milan's grave at noon, April 1, 2008, with the cryptic P.S. "I have proof." Just after the entire sextet is back together, a messenger comes to the grave with a box containing a letter and a laptop computer. The letter says one of the six murdered Milan, and if that person does not confess, all of them will be dead by midnight. As a show of intent, the computer has footage of Charles drowning in his pool.  Everyone goes from the cemetery to the pool to confirm this mishap. Subsequently, an increasingly frantic Desiree sees one "suspect" after another "murdered" before her eyes (though the bodies keep disappearing). Barbie is electrocuted in a beauty pageant dressing room, Peter's campaign truck runs him down in a parking garage, Ryan's throat is slit in his humble apartment, and returning home, Desiree and Blaine discover even their long-time butler Wilford has been butchered in the kitchen.  After a brief separation from her brother, Desiree finds him tied to a chair. Worse yet, gun-wielding Torrance soon has Desiree tied inches away in another chair. After some back and forth, and Torrance fatally shooting Blaine in the chest, a chagrined Desiree finally admits it was she who spiked Milan's fatal drink, while allowing brother Blaine to become the "fall guy." At this point Blaine cannot contain a chuckle, and soon the whole crew of 2008 "victims" are surrounding a still-tied Desiree, telling her what a bitch she is, and how they have conspired to prove it to her. Special effects people from Torrance's ''Boogie Nights 2'' set have equipped Blaine and the others with "squibs," and other cast members faked Desiree out by dressing as cops and "confirming" Ryan's murder as she and her brother were fleeing the scene.  To illustrate her end of the charade involving a revolver shooting blanks, Torrance pulls the trigger once more. Unfortunately for Desiree, this time the cartridge in the chamber is real, and the bullet blows off the top of her head. The next scene involves the same inquest-probate judge from a year earlier absolving Torrance of any guilt for Desiree's death, and confirming Blaine as sole heir of the family estate. The final scene shows Blaine driving off in what was Desiree's red Mercedes, a slowly building smirk on his face.  
Appaloosa (film)
 In 1882, the small town of Appaloosa, [[New Mexico]], is being terrorized by local rancher Randall Bragg ([[Jeremy Irons]]), who killed the town's marshal, Jack Bell, and two deputies when they came to Bragg's ranch to arrest two men. The town hires [[Law enforcement officer|lawman]] and peacekeeper Virgil Cole ([[Ed Harris]]) and his [[Deputy sheriff|deputy]] Everett Hitch ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) to protect and regain control of the town. The pair agrees on one condition: that the town follow Cole's law and essentially cede control to him. The lawmen begin by confronting four of Bragg's men who are causing a disturbance in the saloon. Three men refuse to allow themselves to be arrested, forcing Cole and Hitch to kill them. The fourth man surrenders and leaves the saloon. Bragg has a meeting with Cole and Hitch, initiating a standoff.  Hitch sees a woman, Allie French ([[Renée Zellweger]]), who just came to the town and immediately takes an interest in her. He follows her to the diner where  Cole is having a breakfast. They make acquaintance with her and observing Cole and Allie are getting together well, Hitch keeps his silence. Soon, Cole and Allie begin a romantic relationship and buy a house together. However, Allie attempts to seduce Hitch when they are alone but Hitch refuses her advances out of his loyalty to Cole.  When one of Bragg's men tells Cole and Hitch that he will testify against Bragg on the triple murder case, they arrest Bragg and keep him locked up until the trial in spite of the attempts of Bragg's gang to free him. The trial finds him guilty and sentences him to death. Cole, Hitch and  several deputies transport Bragg via train to the prison where he was to be hanged but when they stop for refueling over a bridge, hired guns Ring and Mackie Shelton ([[Lance Henriksen]] and Adam Nelson), old acquaintances of Cole, appear with Allie at gunpoint, forcing Cole to release Bragg to them.  Cole and Hitch catch up with the outlaws and see Allie and Ring Shelton frolicking naked together in a stream. When the outlaws are attacked by [[Chiricahua Apache]], Cole and Hitch force the Indians away. Hitch tells Cole that Allie's promiscuity is the result of her insecurity and she really likes Cole. They then turn Bragg over to the sheriff of Beauville; unbeknownst to Cole, the sheriff is a cousin of the Shelton brothers. Knowing that Cole is determined to bring Bragg to the gallows, the Sheltons and the sheriff free Bragg and engage Cole and Hitch in a gunfight. Cole and Hitch are wounded but manage to kill Ring, Mackie and the sheriff. Bragg escapes on horseback and Cole and Hitch return to Appaloosa with Allie.  After some time, Bragg is granted a full pardon by President [[Chester Arthur]] (whom he previously claimed to have known) and returns to Appaloosa in an attempt to publicly reform himself. He buys the hotel and ingratiates himself with the locals. Privately he brags before Cole and Hitch to infuriate them over their failure to hang him. Cole tells Hitch that he still wants to be with Allie, despite her fickleness. Hitch decides to leave the town to make some money and resigns as deputy. Later he discovers that Allie is having a relationship with Bragg and challenges Bragg to a duel. Cole attempts to stop him, but Hitch remains steadfast and asks Cole to permit the gunfight to occur. Hitch manages to fire first just before Bragg fires but Bragg's shot misses, and Hitch hits Bragg in the throat, killing him. Hitch leaves town, seeing that Allie and Cole are together; his parting thoughts express his hope that Cole can find happiness with Allie and for him, he gladly walks into uncertainty in hope of finding adventure and fortune.  
Apogee of Fear
 The film starts with a faux preview for ''The Magnificent Five Plus One'', which promotes the Space Station crew as the stars. Richard Garriott is billed as 'The Gunfight Participant' – a satirical nod to his official status as a '[[Spaceflight Participant]].'  A series of motion graphics under the credits leads us to a [[Soyuz spacecraft]] departing the [[International Space Station]], bearing Garriott, Volkov, and Kononenko back to earth. Finke and Chamitoff wave goodbye but express their relief at Garriott's leaving as he was annoying them with his constant talk of computer games. Lonchakov insists that they all go back to work.  One week later, Chamitoff and Fincke are both missing Garriott. Chamitoff could no longer [[juggling|juggle]] without Garriott, and Fincke knew Garriott was good at settling arguments about which of them was standing upside down.  At this point Lonchakov points out that the oxygen use aboard the station is too high. Everyone theorizes wildly about the cause which universally involve interstellar aliens invading the station. A search of ridiculous locations on the station ensues during which the surprising nature of the alien is discovered.  The completed film is just over eight minutes in length. It includes numerous references to classic science-fiction movies including ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'', ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' and ''[[Galaxy Quest]]''.  
Anything for Her
  Julien ([[Vincent Lindon]]) and Lisa Aucler ([[Diane Kruger]]) are a normal couple living happily with their infant son Oscar until one day, police storm into their apartment and arrest Lisa for murder. Then a [[cour d'assises]] sentences her to 20 years in prison.  Three years later, Julien continues to try to find proof that Lisa is innocent, but no new evidence has turned up, and all prior evidence continues to point to her as the prime suspect. The victim was her boss, with whom she had a heated argument on the day of the murder. The scene of the crime was a parking lot outside the office and the boss was killed by a blow to the forehead caused by a fire extinguisher, which had Lisa's fingerprints. It is revealed in a flashback that an unknown woman killed the boss and took her purse before walking away and bumping into Lisa. During the exchange, the boss' blood was smeared on Lisa's coat. She saw the fire extinguisher lying on the road in front of her car, so she picked it up and put it away before driving off, unaware that her boss lay dead on the parking slot beside her.  Seeing no other option, Julien turns to Henri Pasquet ([[Olivier Marchal]]), a former criminal who has escaped from prison seven times and wrote a book about his escape methods. Pasquet explains to him that no prison is airtight and every one of them has a "key" that just has to be found. He also says that getting out is easy, but staying free is difficult, as most escapees make the mistake of running to their families or friends. With this, Pasquet advises the following to Julien: sever all family ties and flee from the country within hours, take flight from a foreign country's airport, choose the right identity for fake documents, go to a country with no ties to French communication, and have enough cash to last him and his family for several years. Back at home, Julien draws a [[mind map]] on the wall, using all of the ideas recorded from his conversation with Pasquet. For the next three months, he visits the prison, observing every security routine and looking for any irregular activity that would lead him to the "key". The mind map wall in his home is filled with photos and diagrams of the prison complex.  One day, he is informed by Dr. Gardes (Frédéric Maranber) that Lisa, who is a [[Diabetes|diabetic]], has refused to take her [[insulin]] for the past few days; because of this, he fears that she is attempting to commit suicide through this method. When Julien talks to her about this, she explains that she does not want to see Oscar (Lancelot Roch) unhappy every time they visit. That night, Julien goes into a bad neighborhood to acquire fake documents; however, he is mugged and robbed by two men posing as the dealers. Back at home, a biker pays him a visit and offers to have fake documents done in a week, risk-free, for €2,500. The papers are exchanged a week later without a hitch. As an addition to his plan, Julien steals Lisa's medical records from a delivery van. He also sells all of his furniture as a means to raise enough money for the getaway.  Julien is suddenly informed that Lisa is to be transferred to [[Rennes]] within three days. Desperate to have all of his funds ready, he makes an attempt to rob a bank, but turns away at the last minute. That night, he holds up a drug dealer, who leads him to a larger dealer named Martial Nashour (Moussa Maaskri). Julien recovers a large amount of money at the cost of Martial and the other dealer in a gunfight. The next day, Julien tears out the mind map from the wall and throws all of its contents away in a dumpster before leaving the apartment with Oscar. He then sneaks into the medical delivery van near the prison and plants an altered version of Lisa's records. He also abandons his car before renting a different car and staying at a hotel nearby with Oscar. Meanwhile, Dr. Gardes reads the medical records, forcing him to have Lisa transferred to the nearest hospital. At the same time, police investigate the scene of Martial's death and discover a piece of taillight from Julien's car. They see the connection and have officers head toward the hospital, knowing that Julien will be there.  At the hospital, Julien enters Lisa's room and has the guards disarmed while he retrieves his wife. They return to the hotel room, where Lisa is reunited with Oscar. The family then leaves France and arrives at [[Liège Airport]] in [[Belgium]]. Back at a police precinct, Julien's mind map is reassembled from the garbage recovered, but detectives decide it is too late to continue their pursuit, as the Auclers have fled to [[San Salvador]], [[El Salvador]], [[Central America]].

Aod goes to bury the foetus and mirror at the base of a small shrine, but is spooked by some noises in the jungle and runs off, leaving everything behind. Meanwhile, the 3rd Eye is causing Duen/Panor to experience some creepy visions—mostly corpses of people slain in the name of black magic. While arguing with some of these invisible creatures, the red string falls off her wrist.  Duen/Panor next goes to a secret hut in the jungle where she has tied up her husband, Prawase. She reveals that she is Duen in Panor's body, and accuses him of trying to abandon her. She tortures him by tearing out his toenails. When she leaves the hut, Prawase gets loose and shoots himself in the head. Deep in the jungle, Duen's soul starts to come loose from Panor's body, and she fights with Dit to keep both pieces together. In their struggles, the mirror containing Panor's soul is broken, Duen's soul is evicted, allowing Panor's to return and Dit runs away. At this exact moment, Ta's great-grandmother starts screaming that the family is about to be destroyed by a ghost.  In the barn, Panor ties Ta's grandfather to a chair and lays out some black magic accoutrements. Panor then pins his eyes open with safety pins, then rubs salt on them, then claims that she will make the grandfather watch the death of his whole family.  Using her black magic (and the extra power of the 3rd Eye), Panor causes Ta's great-grandmother to stab herself in the ear with a metal spike. In the ensuing panic, Aod hears Pen calling for him, and rushes outside to see a vision of her, bleeding. Following the vision to the village windmill, Panor's magic enchants a rope that becomes a noose and encircles his neck. Pen and Ta both arrive and try to save Aod, but they cannot fight the windmill, and Aod is strangled.  Back in the barn, Panor instructs the grandfather to call out to Ta and Pen, and proceeds to drip hot wax into his eyes. Pen and Ta come running, but she causes them to lose their way. Panor uses her magic to cause Pen's foetus to swell up and explode out of her body. Ta finds her body and is faced with a vision of Panor, then attempts to attack her with a stick, but it passes through her body. Dit arrives and stabs Panor's spirit with a magic knife, demanding that she gives him the 3rd Eye in the process. Proving to powerful for him, she pushes Dit away and causes his ever-growing stomach wound to completely consume his chest.  Ta flees and finally reaches the barn, where his grandfather is sitting at a table with the corpses of his family gathered around him. Panor arrives and captures Ta, then burns off his skin with a blow torch (as seen in the previous film). One last flashback reveals that while Panor was a child, she visited a monk to create a spell that would make any man she encountered become attracted to her as she had been bullied by her classmates for her looks.  The film ends with the coda 'One Year Later', and shows Ta meeting his five school chums at the train station, thus beginning [[Art of the Devil 2]].

Arn is the commander of a Templar garrison in [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. He is commanded to join a Templar force intercepting the army of [[Saladin]]. Due to the arrogance of the new Templar Grandmaster [[Gerard de Ridefort]], the Crusaders are destroyed in the ensuing [[Battle of Hattin]].

Arn wakes in [[Damascus]], his wounds treated; Saladin sends him home with his friendship as he prepares to [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|take Jerusalem]].  Cecilia is finally allowed to leave the monastery where she has done penance for twenty years, meeting her son [[Magnus Minniskiöld|Magnus]] for the first time. She soon hears of the fall of Jerusalem and the [[Siege of Acre (1189–1191)|destruction of the Templars]] and believing Arn dead decides to become a nun for the rest of her life, being offered the post of Abbess by the Folkung clan. Arn meets her as she is just about to enter the convent, and they marry at last, building an estate, Forsvik, where Arn has gathered craftsmen from all over Europe and the Holy Land. Arn is introduced to his son Magnus, born in his absence; after a little time a daughter named Alde is born, and Forsvik grows rapidly. Arn takes young men and boys to become knights-in-training.  Six years later King [[Canute I of Sweden]] dies, leaving children as heirs. King [[Sverker II]] retakes the crown with Danish help and attempts to murder the sons of Canute, prevented by the intercession of a Folkung who has tricked Sverker into thinking he was a double agent. Forced to war, the first of what is to be [[Denmark–Sweden relations#History|a nearly 600-year-long conflict between Sweden and Denmark]], Arn leads the Folkung against the Sverker-Danish force at the [[Battle of Lena]], aided by Arabic craftsmen and the Norwegian Templar, Harald. Arn destroys the Danish cavalry tricking them to charge into a rain of arrows. Arn charges forward on horseback to attack King Sverker, and is intercepted by Ebbe Suneson, the leader of the Danes; in the ensuing duel Arn kills him, taking a fatal wound in the exchange. The Folkung emerge victorious, but Arn dies of his wound upon his return to Forsvik. The film concludes with an epilogue foreshadowing the completion of the [[consolidation of Sweden]] into a [[Kings of Sweden#The House of Bj.C3.A4lbo|unified kingdom]] a generation later through [[Birger Jarl]], identified as Arn's grandson.

Funke investigates even deeper into the lives of Paul's shady friends, all members of the Student Council. He discovers their involvement with drug dealing. The Student Council had actually stolen the SATs along with other tests throughout the year, modifying the marks of the best students to make them doubt their test-taking abilities and turn to the Student Council for speed-like "study drugs".

Australia (2008 film)
  In 1939, Lady Sarah Ashley travels from England to northern Australia to force her philandering husband to sell his faltering cattle station, Faraway Downs. Her husband sends an independent cattle [[Drover (Australian)|drover]], called "Drover", to transport her to Faraway Downs.  Lady Sarah's husband is murdered shortly before she arrives, and the authorities tell her that the killer is an Aboriginal elder, "King George". Meanwhile, cattle station manager Neil Fletcher is trying to gain control of Faraway Downs, so that Lesley 'King' Carney will have a complete cattle monopoly, giving him negotiating leverage with an Australian army officer, Captain Dutton, who wants to buy the cattle.  The childless Lady Sarah is captivated by the boy Nullah, who has an Aboriginal mother and a white father. Nullah tells her that he has seen her cattle being driven onto Carney's land — in other words, stolen from her. Because of this Fletcher mistreats Nullah and threatens him and his mother, so Lady Sarah fires Fletcher and decides to try to run the cattle station herself. When Nullah and his mother hide from the authorities in a water tower, his mother drowns. Lady Sarah comforts Nullah by singing the song "[[Over the Rainbow]]" from the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Nullah tells her that "King George" is his grandfather, and that like the Wizard, he too is a "magic man".  Lady Sarah persuades Drover to take the cattle to Darwin for sale. Drover is friendly with the Aboriginals, and therefore shunned by many of the other whites in the territory. It is revealed that he was married to an Aboriginal woman, who died after being refused medical treatment in a hospital because of her race. Lady Sarah also reveals she is unable to have children.  Drover leads a team of six other riders, including Lady Sarah, Drover's Aboriginal brother-in-law Magarri, Nullah, and the station's accountant Kipling Flynn, to drive the 1,500 cattle to Darwin. They encounter various obstacles along the way, including a fire set by Carney's men that scares the cattle, resulting in the death of Flynn when the group tries to stop the cattle from stampeding over a cliff. Lady Sarah and Drover fall in love, and she gains a new appreciation for the Australian territory. The team drive the cattle through the dangerous [[Never Never (Australian outback)|Never Never]] desert. Then, when at last delivering the cattle in Darwin, the group has to race them onto the ship before Carney's cattle are loaded.  Afterwards, Lady Sarah, Nullah, and Drover live together happily at Faraway Downs for two years. Meanwhile, Fletcher kills Carney, marries his daughter Cath Carney, takes over Carney's cattle empire, and continues to menace Lady Sarah. It is established that Fletcher was the actual murderer of Lady Sarah's husband, and is also Nullah's father.  Nullah is drawn to go on a [[walkabout]] (a rite of passage) with his grandfather "King George", but is instead taken by the authorities and sent to live on Mission Island (a fictitious island, but inspired by [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]]) with the other half-Aboriginal children (dubbed the "[[Stolen Generations]]"). Lady Sarah, who has come to regard Nullah as her adopted son, vows to rescue him. Meanwhile, she works as a radio operator in Darwin during the escalation of World War II. When the Japanese [[Bombing of Darwin|attack the island and Darwin]] in 1942, Lady Sarah fears that Nullah has been killed.  Drover, who had quarrelled with Lady Sarah and left, returns to Darwin and hears (mistakenly) that she has been killed in the bombing. Drover learns of Nullah's abduction to Mission Island, and goes with Magarri and a young priest to rescue him and the other children. Magarri was killed by Japanese soldiers during the rescue. Meanwhile, Lady Sarah is about to be evacuated, but when Drover and the children sail back into port at Darwin, and Nullah plays "Over the Rainbow" on his harmonica, Lady Sarah hears the music and the three are reunited.  Fletcher, distraught at the ruination of his plans and at the death of his wife killed during a Japanese air strike, attempts to shoot Nullah, but is speared by King George and falls dead. Lady Sarah, Drover, and Nullah return to the safety of remote Faraway Downs. There, King George calls for Nullah, who returns to the Outback with his grandfather.

Avakai Biryani
 Avakai Biryani (Pickeled Biryani) is a coming of age story of two individuals from two completely different backgrounds and cultural upbringing. The only similarity between them is the fact that they both belong to the same picturesque, historic town of Devarakonda, about 100&nbsp;km from Hyderabad city.  Akbar, an orphan Muslim is an auto driver, whose days are all about lugging passengers from one town to another on the highway. But driving an auto is not all he wants to do. He wants more in life. His goal is to pass his final year B.com examinations, something he has failed to do now three times in a row.  Lakshmi, a traditional Brahmin girl, resettled with her family in Devarakonda, having been displaced from Polavaram. Her family used to traditionally run a hotel over there for many years. Her aim now is to be able to open up a hotel on the highway near Devarakonda and make it a success. She also takes a lot of pride in the avakai (mango pickle) she makes and has big plans of selling them in Hyderabad.  While these central characters go about their goals, the town of Devarakonda itself has a lot of things going on: the village panchayat which seldom takes care of its own people, a thriving 7 seater auto business run corruptly, with the conspirators in this case being two influential people in the town.  Akbar and Lakshmi become friends after first being apprehensive about each other's faiths and backgrounds. They respect each other's dreams and ambitions, which much later turns into a mature loving relationship.  The goings on in the town compel Akbar to take a stand on certain issues. He becomes an accidental hero, but what happens to his relationship with Lakshmi? How much further can it go? Her father is uncompromising in his attitude towards Muslims. The couple takes a decision.

The Baader Meinhof Complex
 On 2 June 1967, the [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] visits [[West Berlin]] and attends a performance at the [[Deutsche Oper]]. Angered at his policies in governing Iran, members of the [[German student movement]] protest his appearance. The West Berlin police and the Shah's security team attack the protesters, and unarmed protester [[Benno Ohnesorg]] is fatally shot by Officer [[Karl-Heinz Kurras]].  Ohnesorg's death outrages West Germany, including [[left wing]] journalist [[Ulrike Meinhof]], who claims in a televised debate that the democratically elected government of West Germany is a [[Fascist]] [[police state]]. Inspired by Meinhof's rhetoric, charismatic radicals [[Gudrun Ensslin]] and [[Andreas Baader]] mastermind the [[:de:Kaufhaus-Brandstiftungen am 2. April 1968|fire bombing of a department store]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. While covering their trial, Ulrike Meinhof finds herself deeply moved by their commitment to [[armed struggle]] against what they see as a [[Neo-Nazi]] Government. She secures a jailhouse interview with Ensslin and the two strike up a close friendship.  Soon after, Meinhof leaves her husband for Peter Homann.   Meanwhile, Ensslin and Baader have been released pending an appeal and attract various young people, including [[Astrid Proll]] and [[Peter-Jurgen Boock]]. After spending some time abroad, Baader, Ensslin and Proll return to West Germany and begin living with Meinhof. Increasingly bored with her middle class life, Meinhof longs to take more [[direct action]]. Even though Ensslin tells her that sacrifices must be made for the revolution, Meinhof does not wish to leave her children. But then, Baader is arrested. Using her connections, Meinhof is able to arrange for him to be interviewed off prison grounds, where Ensslin and the others rescue him. While the plan called for Meinhof to look like an innocent journalist caught in a prison break, she flees with Baader and Ensslin, thereby incriminating herself in the murders of an unarmed civilian and two policemen.   After leaving Meinhof's two children in [[Sicily]], the group receives training in a [[Fatah]] camp in [[Jordan]], where the egotistical and promiscuous Germans enrage their Muslim hosts. Homann leaves the group after overhearing Meinhof, Baader, and Ensslin asking Fatah to kill him. Having also learned that Meinhof wishes to send her two children to a training camp for suicide bombers, Homann informs Meinhof's former colleague [[Stefan Aust]], who returns the children to their father.     Returning to Germany and styling themselves the [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF), Baader and his followers launch a campaign of bank robberies. In response, [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany) |BKA]] chief Horst Herold orders all local police to be put at Federal command for one day.  During that day, RAF member [[Petra Schelm]] drives through a roadblock and is chased by two cops. When cornered, she refuses to go quietly, initiates a gunfight, and is fatally shot by the policemen's return fire. Regarding this as murder, Baader and Ensslin overrule Meinhof's objections and begin systematically bombing police stations and [[United States Military]] bases. As grisly footage of the maimed and the dead appears onscreen, Meinhof's press statements rationalizing the bombings are heard in [[voiceover]].  As the violence escalates, Herold orders the BKA to pioneer [[criminal profiling]] and members of the RAF begin to be arrested. Baader and [[Holger Meins]] are caught after a shoot-out with police. Ensslin and Meinhof are captured soon after.  In separate prisons, the RAF inmates stage a [[hunger strike]] which results in Meins' death. The [[German student movement]] considers this to be murder. The authorities then move Baader, Ensslin, Meinhof, and [[Jan-Carl Raspe]] to [[Stammheim Prison]], where they work on their defense for their trial and smuggle orders outside.    In 1975, a group of younger RAF recruits [[West German Embassy siege|seize the West German embassy in Stockholm]]. The siege ends with a series of explosions, which kill several RAF members and injure the hostages. RAF member [[Siegfried Hausner]] survives the blast but is critically wounded, extradited to West Germany and dies in a prison hospital. The imprisoned RAF members are appalled by the poor execution of their orders for the Stockholm operation. Meanwhile, Herold's assistant asks why people who have never met Baader are willing to take orders from him. Herold replies, "A myth."  Meinhof, suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and remorse over the deaths caused by their bombings, is subjected to sadistic emotional abuse by Baader and Ensslin, who call her a traitor and "a knife in the RAF's back". In response, Meinhof hangs herself in her cell. The imprisoned RAF members accuse West Germany's Government of murdering her during their trial and are widely believed.   Upon completing her sentence [[Brigitte Mohnhaupt]] takes over command of the RAF outside. She informs Boock that Baader has forbidden any more attacks on "the people" and enlists his help smuggling weapons into Stammheim. In retaliation for the "murders" of Meins, Hausner, and Meinhof, the RAF assassinates West Germany's Attorney General, [[Siegfried Buback]]. Mohnhaupt,  [[Christian Klar]], and [[Susanne Albrecht]], also attempt to kidnap [[Dresdner Bank]] President [[Jürgen Ponto]], who fights back and is shot dead. Knowing that the imprisoned RAF members have ordered both murders, the West German Government returns them to solitary confinement. Even so, Ensslin and Baader obtain two way radios and continue smuggling orders outside.  Mohnhaupt then abducts industrialist [[Hanns-Martin Schleyer]] and demands the release of her imprisoned comrades in exchange for not killing him. When West German authorities fail to meet their demands, the RAF and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] hijack [[Lufthansa Flight 181]]. The hijacking ends with the plane being stormed and the hostages saved.   In Stammheim, Baader warns a West German Government negotiator that the violence will continue to escalate. Ensslin makes the same prediction to the prison chaplain and claims that the West German Government is about to murder her and her imprisoned comrades.  The following morning, corrections officers find Baader and Raspe shot to death in their cells as the handguns Mohnhaupt smuggled into the prison lie nearby. Ensslin is found hanging from the steel bars of the window. They also find [[Irmgard Möller]] stabbed four times in the chest, but still alive.  When the news reaches the free RAF members, they are devastated and certain that the trio was murdered. To their shock, Mohnhaupt explains that Baader, Ensslin, Möller, and Raspe "are not victims and never were". She explains, that they, like Meinhof, were "in control of the outcome until the very end". When the RAF members react with stunned disbelief, Mohnhaupt responds, "You did not know them. Stop thinking that they were different than they were."  In a sign that RAF terrorism will continue, the last moments of the film show the murder of hostage Hanns-Martin Schleyer.  In an ironic commentary on the violence of the era, [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[Blowin' in the Wind]]'' plays during the credits.

Backwoods (film)
  The film opens as a couple named Tom and Gwen are in a [[national park]] and are attacked and taken hostage. Later Gwen is raped and impregnated while Tom is killed.  Mark Till is a young CEO, a self-made sporting goods tycoon who sees human survival as a skill to be honed and cherished in the boardroom and beyond. That's why each year he sponsors a week-long survival getaway to test the mettle of twelve lucky employees, to challenge them, body and mind. This year it's a paintball war in the remote woods/ national park in northern California. Total outsiders to the wary locals, these urban Rambos think they're ready for anything.  On the first day, the Alpha and Bravo camps are set up. In the night, one of Mark's team, Adam Benson hears a noise in the dark and goes to investigate, but sees nothing. The next day the Paintball War begins. A few minutes later a member of Mark's team pops a figure ambling through the woods. Score one for Alpha- until they realize that the person they hit isn't part of either team.  While attempting to make it back to camp, the Beta team comes across an abandoned house. Inside they are attacked and kidnapped by men with primitive weapons such as axes and bows. The men who kidnapped them are part of an overzealous religious group, who have mistaken the team for FBI Agents, who have supposedly come to claim their land. The Alpha group return to their camp and find it ransacked and their gas siphoned off. As they try to find some gas, Johnny (CEO) spots two men across the lake from their campsite. One points and the other shoots Johnny through the neck, killing him instantly. The others try to make a break for it and manage to escape.  Adam then attempts to contact the Park Ranger, but his call is intercepted by one of the cult and he and the others are captured by a man posing as a Park Ranger. Maggie (the only girl in the Beta group) is shown with the leader of the cult (called "Mother"), who tells her the cult's camp is her home now. When Maggie resists, she is taken away and raped by Mother's biological son, a large beast-like man. Gwen, the woman who was captured at the beginning of the film, is now shown to be pregnant, and a servant to the cultist group. Lee (the only girl from Group Alpha) is also taken and prepared to be used as a vessel for Mother's son's "seed", while the boys are put into cages and brutalized by the males in the cult.  The fake ranger, who appears to be Mother's husband and the Cult's protector, takes Adam and tortures him, attempting to get information about the FBI's plans. When Adam resists, he sends one of the other cult members to finish him off. As his throat is about to be slit, Adam breaks free of his ropes, and attacks and kills his would-be murderer. He then sets the surviving team members (Perry and Basso, the only two have survived the brutalizing) free. They escape, killing several cult members along the way, and rescue the girls. Maggie is hysterical after her ordeal. The group escapes with Lee, who seduced Mother's son into setting her free with touches and kisses, and a good kick in the face.  The survivors are pursued by the cultists. After setting fire to the compound, they are cornered outside it. As they are about to be executed, they turn the tables, taking Mother hostage. Basso is killed and the others escape, severely injuring and killing several cultists, including Mother. Later, Perry falls prey to a tripwire-rigged trap, impaling him through the gut. Although painful, he manages to survive long enough to kill off several more cultists and give the others the time they need to get away, after which his head is bashed in by Mother's son.  Lee, Maggie and Adam make it up to a mountain where Maggie, who is now delusional from the trauma, commits suicide by jumping off the cliff. Lee and Adam escape by jumping into a river and swimming to the shore, where they meet the real Park Ranger. Then Mother's husband, her son, and another cultist arrive in a truck and shoot the Ranger with an arrow. Adam then takes his gun and shoots both the cultists. Mother's husband attempts to run Adam down, but collides with the Ranger's truck. Adam shoots him as he begs for help.  Much later, the FBI and the Police arrive, giving medical attention to Adam and Lee. Adam is disturbed to hear that only two bodies were recovered from the final confrontation.  An FBI team treks through the forest, searching for the cult, when Gwen comes out of a cave, having finally escaped herself. As the agent leading the group walks toward her, Gwen shouts for her to run. The head agent is taken by surprise by Mother's son, who has survived the gunshot wounds, and the movie ends.  
Babylon A.D.
 In 2027, Russian mobster Gorsky hires mercenary Toorop to bring a young woman known only as Aurora to New York City. Gorsky gives Toorop a variety of weapons and a subdermally implanted UN passport. Toorop, the girl, and her guardian  Sister Rebeka, travel from the Noelite Convent in Mongolia to reach New York via Russia.  Unlike the technologically advanced U.S., war and terrorist activity have transformed Russia's cities into dangerous, overpopulated slums. They must also evade an unknown group of mercenaries claiming to have been sent by Aurora's supposedly dead father. The stress of humanity's situation causes Aurora to act out in strange ways and display clairvoyance abilities. On one such occasion, Aurora, seemingly for no reason, panics and runs from a crowded train station, just before it explodes in a terrorist attack.  Later, they board a submarine that carries refugees to Canada. To avoid satellite detection, the submarine abandons and shoots some refugees. Aurora, infuriated by the loss of life, operates the 30-year-old submarine without training. Sister Rebeka tells Toorop that Aurora could speak nineteen different languages by the age of two, and always seems to know things she has never learned. Three months before leaving with Toorop, she began acting differently. This occurred after a Noelite doctor administered a pill. The doctor tells her to go to [[New York City]] and arranges for Toorop to take them.  Once in [[Harlem]], a news broadcast about the bombing of the convent causes the group to realize there is more going on than they know. The Noelites have become a major new salvationist religion, which vast numbers of people cling to as the world spirals out of control. However, in private meetings, it is seen that their High Priestess only desires power and uses invented miracles to court converts. Gorsky, working for the Noelites, had planted a tracking device in Toorop's passport and bombed the convent when he knew they were in the United States. The doctor who earlier saw Aurora examines her again. When he leaves, Aurora reveals (without being told) that she is pregnant with twins despite being a virgin.  Looking outside, Toorop sees Gorsky's men and the Noelite group, heavily armed and waiting for them. The High Priestess calls Toorop and asks him to bring Aurora outside. Just before they take her away, Toorop changes his mind and starts a firefight with the two groups to get two women to safety. Gorsky's men can lock onto Toorop with rockets tracking his heartbeat. Rebeka dies defending Aurora, who in turn shoots Toorop, saying, "I need you to live." By dying, the rocket goes off target and explodes near Aurora instead; she inexplicably survives.  Dr. Arthur Darquandier revives Toorop using advanced medical techniques, but several of Toorop's body parts are replaced with [[cybernetics]] to undo the damage of being dead for over two hours. Darquandier says when Aurora was a fetus, he implanted a supercomputer into her brain. It is also implied that the Noelite group had him create Aurora to become pregnant at a certain time to use her as a "[[Miraculous births|virgin birth]]".  After she was born, the Noelites hired Gorsky to kill Darquandier, but he failed. Darquandier remained "dead" until he found his daughter in Russia with Toorop. Darquandier uses a machine to scan Toorop's memory to find what Aurora said to him before Toorop "died". In Toorop's memory, Aurora tells Toorop to "go home". Toorop and several of Darquandier's men leave the facility. En route to Darquandier's lab, the High Priestess calls Gorsky, at which point he is killed by a nuclear missile sent to him by the High Priestess. Darquandier is later killed by the High Priestess, but it is too late, since Toorop has already escaped.  Toorop goes to his old house in the forest, finds Aurora, and takes her to a hospital, where she dies after giving birth.  Aurora was "designed to breed", not to live, so her death after childbirth was preprogrammed. Toorop takes care of her two children.  In a scene that is only present in the theatrical cut but was removed from the director's cut, the twins are shown to be of different ethnicities, one looking like Aurora and the other like Toorop.

When Mahi misses her train, Raj, a passenger on the same train, gets off to help her out. He offers to help her reach the airport through a different route in time for her return flight. On the way, Mahi develops a crush on Raj and they share a kiss after Raj reads her a poem he wrote about her. At the airport, Mahi meets her friends and tells them about Raj. When she opens the paper on which Raj had written the poem, she finds it blank. She overhears Raj boasting to his friends about the "stuff" the pair did, and is shocked and heartbroken. Raj realises she has overheard and shamefacedly leaves the airport.  In 2002, Raj has moved to [[Mumbai]] and found a job with [[Microsoft]] as a game designer. He is in a [[live-in relationship]] with Radhika, an aspiring model. Raj receives an offer to move to Sydney for a [[Halo 3]] game launch. He expects to be able to leave Radhika and move on, assuming she is a "modern girl" capable of moving past a break-up. This vision is shattered when Radhika unexpectedly declares that she intends to sacrifice her career as a model to marry Raj and join him in Australia. Raj, unable to express his commitment-phobia, flees. He boards a flight to Sydney on the day he is to marry Radhika. Radhika learns this while waiting for him at the marriage registrar's office, and is left crestfallen.  In 2007, Raj now enjoys a successful career in Sydney. One day, he runs into Gayatri, a feisty and independent woman who drives a taxi at night and studies at business school during the day. Raj befriends her and learns that she, like him, does not believe in the sanctity of marriage. As they date he realises that his feelings for her challenge his deep-set misgivings towards commitment. Raj musters the courage to propose, but Gayatri turns him down, saying that she is happy with her life as is. Rejection cuts Raj deep. As he stands alone watching his true love walk away, he recalls when he broke the hearts of Mahi and Radhika, realising how they must have felt. He decides to seek them out and ask for forgiveness.  On his return to India in 2008, he first seeks out Mahi, who is now married and has two sons. He runs into her husband Joginder ([[Kunal Kapoor]]), who expresses his anger, as he had heard about Raj's exploits. He explains that while Mahi on the surface appears the perfect housewife and perfect mother, she no longer believes in love. Raj apologises to Mahi and convinces her that her husband is the real "Raj" she has been waiting for, and Mahi forgives him.  Raj then embarks on a search for Radhika. He discovers that she has changed her name to Shreya and has become a highly successful supermodel. After much effort, he manages to meet her and apologises. Shreya refuses to accept his apologies and tells him that if he really wants her forgiveness, he will have to work hard for it. To do this, Raj becomes her personal assistant and she makes him do all sorts of tasks, from cleaning to serving at parties. She tries to humiliate him on every occasion, but Raj remains firm in his resolve and continues to serve without complaint. She finally gives up and tells him how hurt she felt, alone on the day that was supposed to be their wedding. Exasperated, she tells Raj to give up his penance and go home. However, while Raj is waiting for his flight to Sydney, she arrives and tells him that she has realised that the root of her frustration was bottled-up hate against Raj that she no longer bears. She forgives him. Content, Raj returns to Australia, having completed what he had set out to do.  On his return, Raj finds a pile of letters from Gayatri, written over the six months Raj was gone. While he has been away, Gayatri has had second thoughts and regretted turning him down. The lovers reunite.

Bam Margera Presents: Where the ♯$&% Is Santa?
 In [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], [[Bam Margera]], his wife [[Missy Margera]], and friends get ready to celebrate [[Christmas]]. After destroying friend [[Brandon Novak]]'s new car (the first car that he ever owned), Bam realizes that he has to get Missy a special present: [[Santa Claus]]. When discussing how to find Santa, Bam states that he lives in [[Lapland, Finland]] and that the common misconception is that he lives in the [[North Pole]]. Disagreeing, he makes a bet with [[Mark The Bagger]] that he will find Santa and bring him back to West Chester as a present for Missy; if he cannot find Santa, Mark gets to go on a date with Missy. Novak also makes a side-bet with Bagger that he can sleep with more women in Finland than Bagger can in Pennsylvania, even with the help of friend [[Jimmy Pop]].  After traveling to [[Philadelphia]] for a new passport, because he misplaced the other one, and then flying from [[JFK Airport]], Bam and friends arrive in [[Helsinki, Finland]] to find directions to Santa's house. Their first stop was at the rehearsal area for [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]], Bam's favorite band and personal friends, who draw a map on Mark Hanna's chest with marker, then play "[[Dead Lovers' Lane]]" to close for Bam. Before leaving, Bam decides to get the map drawn by [[Ville Valo]] tattooed on the Mark's chest so it doesn't get lost. With complete directions, they all leave on a train north to [[Tampere]] where they run into [[The Dudesons]], Jarppi and Jukka. The next morning, before heading towards Santa, Novak persuades the group to go to a [[Hanoi Rocks]] concert where friend [[Andy McCoy]] tells them they must hike about nine hours to reach Santa once they've reached [[Rovaniemi]]. During a night in the Finland wilderness, Bam cuts off [[Joe Frantz]]'s long hair while Frantz sleeps by the campfire. Frantz wakes up, finds that part of his hair is gone, and in a rage, trips into the fire pit.  Meanwhile, back in Pennsylvania, Bagger and Jimmy Pop attempt to pick up women, unsuccessfully, and also assist Missy and April preparing for a Christmas party. Upon leaving southern Finland, Bam and the rest of the group hike through the snow for several days until they finally reach [[Santa Claus Village]] above the [[Arctic Circle]] in Finland. Searching the workshop, they find that Santa has gone on vacation to the [[Bahamas]] and so Bam has lost his bet. Before traveling back, Bam and the group meet back up with Andy McCoy, Jonne Aaron Liimatainen of [[Negative (Finnish band)|Negative]] and [[Jussi 69]] of [[The 69 Eyes]] at Corona bar in Helsinki, where they find a stranger who looks similar to Santa to agree to come back with Bam to America and pose as the real Santa. Novak also wins his part of the bet with two women.  Upon arriving back in Pennsylvania, Bam presents "Santa" to Missy and she gives him a tour bus and invites pro skateboarders such as [[Kerry Getz]] and others to attend the Christmas party. Missy also arranges for a local band called The Moxy to play in the skate barn.  The party ensues, and afterwards, the Finnish Santa disappears and Bam attempts to give Novak a poorly refurbished car to amend for destroying it before, although he does not accept it. Before the credits roll, [[Chad I. Ginsburg]] informs [[Seth Meisterman]] that it was merely a stranger they found in a bar rather than the real Santa.<ref name="SantaDVD"></ref>  During the credits, while everybody is opening their Christmas presents, Novak reveals that he stole Bam's passport as payback for the damage to his car.

Bangkok Dangerous (2008 film)
 Joe (Cage) is a professional freelance [[Contract killing|contract killer]] who works strictly by the rules; never socializing outside his work, staying secluded in quiet spots, never interacting or meeting with his handlers and always leaving on time without a trace. He usually hires young pickpockets or small-time criminals as his local help, whom he usually murders after the end of the job to prevent any identification. He uses multiple aliases and also has middlemen between him and his handlers. He also carries a watch to perform a hit in specific time and correctly visualizes his every target.  After completing a hit in [[Prague]] and killing his current help, Joe travels to [[Bangkok]] for an assignment to assassinate four people for notorious Bangkok [[Boss (crime)|crime boss]] Surat, whom he never meets. Joe occasionally provides insight via voiceover narration throughout the film. He hires a local [[Thai people|Thai]] pickpocket named Kong, who has simple English knowledge, as his go-between in Bangkok, a condition of the contract being that the gang will never meet Joe. Contracts from the Bangkok gangsters are passed to Kong one by one via a nightclub dancer, Aom. Joe's first execution in Bangkok is done on motorcycle; when the target car stops at a red light, Joe kills all the occupants with a machine pistol.  Kong retrieves information about the second target, again via Aom, and the pair become friendlier with every contact. Before Joe executes his mission, Kong informs him of the target, Pramod Juntasa, another notorious gang lord and Surat's rival crime boss who acts as a sex trafficker, buying young girls from impoverished parents and selling them after sex deals. Joe sneaks into the target's penthouse and drowns him in his pool. Unsatisfied with Kong's assistance, Joe contemplates killing him, but after a brief confrontation when Kong is ambushed by local gangsters regarding a briefcase containing information files of Surat's/Joe's targets, he instead decides to act as Kong's mentor and trains him for self-defense.  Midway through the movie, Joe meets Fon, a deaf-mute pharmacist, with whom he becomes intrigued after a brief consultation. Joe later returns to the pharmacy to invite Fon out for dinner. Soon after Joe falls for Fon and meets her mother. The affair is cut short when he shoots and kills two assailants in Fon's presence. Blood splatters on Fon, and she runs off, trembling and traumatized by the violent deaths. Feeling betrayed, Fon cannot forgive Joe and ends their relationship.  Before the third kill, the gang attempts to identify Joe, and he warns them off. For the third execution that takes place at the [[Damnoen Saduak floating market]], Kong assists Joe. The kill does not go as planned, and the target, a playboy and a criminal underworld associate, nearly gets away but Joe manages to catch and assassinate him. Before beginning his last mission Joe visits Fon, presumably to say goodbye. She initially ignores him but as Joe begins to drive away she runs after his car.  His fourth target is the [[Prime Minister of Thailand]], who is revered by many. Joe is about to make the kill when he has second thoughts, is spotted, and escapes through a panicking crowd. Meanwhile, the gang has abducted Aom and Kong with plans to execute them. Joe, now a target, is attacked at his house by four of Surat's henchmen. He uses explosives to take them out and is faced with the choice of rescuing Kong or leaving the country unharmed. Joe decides to rescue Kong, so he sets off to the gang's headquarters with one of the half-alive attackers.  Joe goes to the gang's headquarters, kills most of the gang including Surat's underboss/bodyguard (who is blown into half by explosives), and saves Kong and Aom. The fearful gang leader flees to his car with three other accomplices. Joe spots him and shoots the gang members, then gets into the back seat with Surat. As the police arrive at the location, Joe realizes he has only one bullet. He puts his head adjacent to Surat's, puts the gun up to his temple and pulls the trigger, killing himself and Surat.  ===Alternate ending=== An alternate ending to the theatrical version shows that before Joe kills himself in the original version, Kong steals a police car and comes to his rescue. He kills Surat and runs to the stolen car (although he is shot once in the arm). After eluding the police officers, they hide in a neighborhood a few meters away from Surat's headquarters. As locals come out to investigate the commotion, Kong reveals that Joe is the man who killed Surat. They help him recuperate while one local remarks that Surat was a very bad man, adding that his death marks an end to his crimes and atrocities in their place ''(with the words "it's good that he is dead")'' Kong then takes Joe to a boatman and gives him his passports, so that he may flee the country. Joe thanks Kong for his assistance, and gives him a bank account number with "a bonus", stating that he was a good student. Joe then departs, with the camera focused on Kong (from Joe's perspective, similar to the original ending).  
The Bank Job
 The British Security Services ([[MI5]]) have taken interest in a [[safe deposit box]] that is located in a [[Lloyd's Bank]] branch on the corner of [[Baker Street]] and [[Marylebone Road]]. It belongs to a black militant gangster, [[Michael X]] ([[Peter de Jersey]]), and contains compromising photos of [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]],<ref>[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/how-mi5-raided-a-bank-to-get-pictures-of-princess-margaret-6584054.html "How MI5 raided a bank to get pictures of Princess Margaret"] ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' 20 May 2007</ref> which he is keeping as insurance to keep the British authorities off his back. Martine Love ([[Saffron Burrows]]), an ex-model who is romantically involved with MI5 agent Tim Everett ([[Richard Lintern]]), is caught at [[Heathrow Airport]] smuggling drugs into the country, and to avoid going to jail, she makes a deal with the authorities whereby she agrees to retrieve the photos.  Martine approaches her friend Terry ([[Jason Statham]]), a struggling [[East London]] car salesman with criminal contacts, and tells him that if he can assemble the gang to help her rob the bank, he will be richly rewarded, though she does not tell him about the photos in the deposit box. Terry recruits a small team, including one of his own workers, Eddie ([[Michael Jibson]]), to serve as the look-out, and Dave ([[Daniel Mays]]), a porn actor who once made films for Lew Vogel ([[David Suchet]]), a gangster whom Dave happens to run into outside the bank before the robbery.   The gang tunnels its way into the bank vault, where it steals money and other valuables, but Terry is suspicious when he notices that Martine seems to be interested only in one box containing nothing but photographs. After they escape together, Terry throws off a pursuit by MI5. By now, the police have been alerted to the robbery by a ham radio operator who has picked the "chatter" from the gang's [[walkie-talkie]]s up, and Lew learns that among the missing safe deposit boxes is his own box, which is full of evidence about his payoffs to crooked cops. He notifies a furious Michael X in [[Trinidad]], who correctly suspects [[Gale Benson]] ([[Hattie Morahan]]), [[Hakim Jamal]]'s lover, of spying for MI5, and subsequently murders her. Lew decides that Dave’s presence outside that particular bank was not a coincidence, and has him tortured for information. Dave gives in, and Lew goes to Terry’s garage to kidnap Eddie. Meanwhile, a government minister learns that he is also featured in some of the stolen photos, and persuades MI5 to give the robbers new passports and safe passage in exchange for the photos in order to avoid a scandal.       One of the crooked cops on Lew's payroll kills Dave, and threatens to shoot Eddie unless Lew gets his evidence back. Terry agrees to deliver it to him at [[Paddington railway station|Paddington station]] at the same time when he is supposed to be picking his new passports up from MI5, but has meanwhile passed the details on to an honest cop, Roy, who alerts MI5 agents. During the exchange, Lew recognises the agents, and he and the corrupt cops make a run for it. Terry pursues Lew and proceeds to beat him up, but Roy breaks the fight up and arrests Lew and his colleagues. In Trinidad, Michael X is also arrested. With his freedom and his new passport, Terry and his family enjoy a carefree life on their small motor yacht off a sunny beach.  
Barbie: Mariposa
 Bibble is worried that he will embarrass himself and won't belong with his friend's friends, so Elina tells him the story of her friend Mariposa, a butterfly fairy who lives in a far-off palace called Flutterfield, an island kingdom in Fairytopia populated by fairies with butterfly wings. Henna, the jealous butterfly fairy and the attendant of the queen of Flutterfield, has poisoned the queen in an attempt to take over the kingdom. Due to this, the lights are in danger of going out if she succumbs to the poison. These lights protect Flutterfield from the "Skeezites", monsters who eat butterfly fairies and are repellent to light. It is up to Mariposa and her employers-friends, sisters Rayna and Rayla, to find an antidote to save the queen.  They first travel according to the map, but when night falls, they are far from Flutterfield, and the Skeezites appear. They engage in a long chase scene, but Mariposa, Rayna and Rayla escape through a gate of red plants. However, the map gets chomped by a Skeezite. Mariposa remembers that there was a sun picture on the map, and she concludes that they should travel east, as toward the rising sun. The three then arrive at the Wilderness, and encounter a little flying rabbit named Zinzie, who is a great thrower and loves fluttercorn, and leads them to a [[mermaid]] statue in exchange for a packet of fluttercorn. They end up all diving into a lake and find mermaids. Mariposa asks them to tell her the whereabouts of the Cave of Reflections, and the mermaids agree to help them, but they ask for one thing in exchange: Concho shells. However, little merbabies are sleeping and use these shells as pillows, and it is revealed that if you wake the baby, the baby cries and wakes a sea monster. Rayla finds a plant, and wraps it until it bears the shape of the conch shells. They gently swap the shells with the plant, but one of the babies is tickled on the nose by a little leaf that was not wrapped properly, and the baby wakes and starts crying. This wakes the other babies, who as well start crying, waking the sea monster. While Mariposa delivers the conch shells to the mermaids, Rayna, Zinzie and Rayla try to escape the sea monster by swimming in different directions. The mermaids help in the end, and they all escape the sea monster.  Meanwhile, Queen Marabella has fallen fatally ill, and the guards captured the prince for trying to find the antidote. The queen's captain of the guards holds him in a conversation, and another fairy sought the prince and freed him. That fairy is Willa, Mariposa's best friend. She tells the prince that she has spotted Henna. So they decide to follow her, and the two find out that she had taken control over Skeezites by mixing a strange liquid and thistleburst; moreover, they discover that Henna was plotting to take over Flutterfield all this time.  The mermaids tell the four braves where to find the Cave of Reflections, and they fly towards it eagerly, but find that the cave was guarded by Skeezites. Zinzie manages to trick the Skeezites, and the four escape into the cave. There, they find their reflections talking back to themselves. They finally meet the Fairy of the Cave, who leads the group to different sections, where she proclaims each time "one of you must stay behind". Mariposa was left as the last one, and the cave fairy guides her toward a place filled with stars. She tells that one star hold the antidote she needs. Mariposa eventually finds one (which was all by itself), in which she used the archer's star pattern to locate it. This hints that this was the correct star, and for that reason, Mariposa is presented with much larger and more beautiful sparkling wings.  The four heroines arrive back just in time when the Skeezites start attacking everyone at the Royal fairy castle. Mariposa eventually discovers that it was Henna who poisoned the queen, so she races to cure her with the antidote. Henna tries stopping Mariposa from foiling her plans, but Mariposa eventually manages to heal Marabella before she dies. Henna leaves and goes away with the Skeezites under the pretense of not getting caught, thus fleeing from the light. After the big save, Queen Marabella presents each of the heroines with a crown of flowers. Since then, Mariposa felt she belonged in Flutterfield, having learned that being herself is the best thing in life.  
Barbie & the Diamond Castle
 The movie begins with Barbie and her best friend Teresa trying to play a song on their guitars when Barbie's sister, Stacie, storms in, angry at her friend Courtney and calls her a 'backstabber'. Barbie decides to tell Stacie the story of two friends named Liana and Alexa, who also get angry at each other.  The two best friends live in a hut beside a beautiful garden and plant flowers to make a living. They also share a love of music. One day, they find two heart-shaped stones which they make into necklaces to symbolize their friendship, not realizing that they are trinkets from the mythical Diamond Castle. The next day, an old woman gives them a mirror after they share the last of their food with her. The mirror is the hiding place of Melody, an apprentice muse from the Diamond Castle. Melody is on the run from Lydia, one of former three muses who lived in the Diamond Castle. Lydia became evil and turned the other two muses to stone, but not before they hid the Castle and left the key with Melody. If Lydia finds the Diamond Castle, all music will end, and with it eventually the world. Liana and Alexa coax a song out of Melody by singing, and Lydia's minion, a dragon known as Slyder, locates Melody by her voice.  With their home destroyed by Slyder, Alexa and Liana go with Melody to find the Diamond Castle and keep it safe from Lydia. They find two small puppies and at an inn meet twin musicians named Ian and Jeremy, who hear the girls sing and instantly fall for them, but the girls leave them behind at the inn. Lydia confronts them, and tries to cast a spell on them with her flute, but the girls' necklaces protect them. Lydia sets Slyder on them, but Ian and Jeremy arrive and they all escape.  The girls, now with the twins, comes across a dead end but soon meet a dislikable troll who captures the boys and vows to eat them and not let the group cross his bridge unless the girls answer his riddles. They do, which frees the boys and reveals a rainbow bridge that carries the girls off, leaving the boys behind. Liana and Alexa soon run out of food. They find a mansion and go to ask for shelter, but the servants there, bewitched by Lydia, tell them that they are the long-awaited mistresses of the house. Alexa wants to stay, but Liana wants to honor the promise they made to Melody, resulting to an argument which turns to a fight. Liana leaves the house with Melody and Alexa stays, ripping off her magic necklace that symbolizes her friendship with Liana in anger. Slyder arrives and takes Alexa to Lydia. After determining that Melody is not with Alexa, Lydia uses her flute's powers against Alexa to find Liana, and because Alexa is not wearing her magical necklace, she falls under Lydia's spell. Alexa tells Lydia that Liana and Melody are heading to the seven stones, where the Diamond Castle is hidden.  After Liana is kidnapped, Lydia uses Alexa to scare Melody into revealing the whereabouts of the Diamond Castle. Although Lydia promises to release Liana and Alexa once the Diamond Castle is hers, Slyder knocks the two girls over a cliff, and they narrowly escape falling into acid by hanging onto a ledge. Liana realizes that the necklaces protected them from Lydia'a spell and uses Alexa's necklace to undo the spell and they climb up the cliff together. Alexa apologizes to Liana for their fight and Liana apologizes too. One of the puppies leads the twins to the girls and together they all head to the hiding place of the Diamond Castle.  Meanwhile, Melody stalls Lydia with false instructions about the key to the castle. The twins lure Slyder away and the girls pretend to fall under Lydia's spell. Lydia creates a whirlpool and commands the girls to jump in and drown, but Liana takes Lydia's flute instead. Lydia threatens to break Melody's mirror, but Melody breaks it herself, not wanting to let the Diamond Castle fall into Lydia's hands.  Lydia throws the mirror in the whirlpool. Alexa saves Melody with the puppies' help and Liana drops Lydia's flute in the whirlpool. Lydia goes after it, but is caught in the flow. She tries to cast a spell, but her waterlogged flute backfires and she disappears instead.  The girls realize that the song Melody sang earlier is the key, and their singing is the true key of the Diamond Castle. As they step inside, Melody is released from the mirror and she leads Liana and Alexa to the other muses' instruments. Lydia suddenly returns on Slyder and attacks them. Melody saves the instruments from being turned to stone, and the girls play the instruments and sing, creating a barrier that turns Lydia's spells against her, turning both her and Slyder into stone.  The muses  returned to life. They anointed Liana and Alexa  as princesses of music, promoted Melody as the third  muse and give Jeremy and Ian electric guitars. The muses offer Liana and Alexa to stay at the castle but they want to go home instead, so the muses give them flower seeds and send them on their way.  Back home, Liana and Alexa plant the magical flower seeds and beautiful flowers soon grow. Jeremy and Ian are successful in their performances with their electric guitars.  When the story ends, Stacie realizes nothing can break true friendship and with that, She calls Courtney to apologize after saying goodbye to Barbie and Teresa as they get back to playing their music.

Her story takes place in a part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] that is now [[Slovakia]]. In this retelling, the Countess is a healer who conducts medical experiments and rudimentary autopsies in a "hospital" beneath her castle. She forms a relationship with a reputed witch, Darvulia, who saves her from poisoning. The witch promises Erzsebet a son and eternal beauty. In return, Erzsebet must sacrifice both love and her reputation. Darvulia becomes Erzsebet's companion. Meanwhile, maidens in the area have been dying of seemingly unrelated causes, and Erzsebet is seen bathing in a large tub of red liquid as the girls' now-mutilated corpses are buried nearby. Two monks later conclude that the water is not blood but is simply colored red by herbs.

Be Kind Rewind
 In [[Passaic, New Jersey]], the declining "Be Kind Rewind" VHS rental store owned by Mr. Elroy Fletcher ([[Danny Glover]]) is due to be demolished to make way for high-end development (due in large part to the refusal of Mr. Fletcher to rent out [[DVD]]s) unless he can find the money to renovate his building, despite his claims that jazz pianist [[Fats Waller]] was born in that building. Mr. Fletcher leaves on a trip for several days to join friends and memorialize Waller, as well as visiting a DVD rental store to learn efficient and modernized ways of running a video rental store, leaving his only employee, Mike ([[Mos Def]]), to tend to the store. Before leaving Mr. Fletcher cautions Mike to keep his [[paranoia|paranoid]] and klutzy friend, Jerry ([[Jack Black]]), away from the store.  After attempting to sabotage a nearby electrical substation, believing its energy to be melting his brain, Jerry becomes magnetized, and when he enters the store the next day, he inadvertently erases all the VHS tapes in the store (as well as making the camera go out of focus, whenever he walks past it).  Mike quickly discovers the disaster, and is further pressed when Miss Falewicz ([[Mia Farrow]]), Mr. Fletcher's friend, wants to rent ''[[Ghostbusters]]''.  To prevent her from reporting a problem to Mr. Fletcher, Mike comes up with an idea: as Miss Falewicz has never seen the movie, he proposes to recreate the film using himself and Jerry as the actors and cheap special effects hoping to fool her.  They complete the movie just in time when another customer asks for ''[[Rush Hour 2]]''.  Mike and Jerry repeat their filming, enlisting the help of Alma ([[Melonie Diaz]]), a local woman, for some of the parts.  Word of mouth spreads through Miss Falewicz's nephew (Chandler Parker) of the inadvertently hilarious results of Mike and Jerry's filming, and soon the store is seeing more requests for such movies.  Mike, Jerry, and Alma quickly pass off the movies as being "sweded", insisting the films came from Sweden and thus able to demand long wait times and higher costs for the rental.  Soon, to meet demand, Mike and Jerry enlist the locals to help out in making the movies, using them as starring roles in their films.  When Mr. Fletcher returns, intent on converting the store to a [[DVD]] rental outlet, he quickly recognizes that they are making more money from the sweded films than from normal rentals, and joins in with the process.  However, the success is put to a halt when two court [[bailiff]]s ([[Sigourney Weaver]] and [[Paul Dinello]]) arrive, insisting the sweded films are [[copyright infringement|copyright violations]], and seize the tapes and the store's assets, crushing the tapes with a [[steamroller]]. Without any money to renovate the building, Mr. Fletcher gives up hope, and is forced to reveal to Mike that he made up the connection of Fats Waller to their building.  Mr. Fletcher is given a week to evacuate the building before it will be razed.  Jerry, with the help of the local townspeople, convinces Mr. Fletcher and Mike to give one last hurrah and put together a documentary dedicated to the fake life of Fats Waller, and the two quickly warm up to the idea.  On the day the building is scheduled for demolition, Mr. Fletcher invites all the locals to watch the final film.  In his eagerness to start the show due to the presence of the demolition crew waiting to start the job, Jerry accidentally breaks the only TV the store has, but a nearby DVD store owner loans them his [[video projector]], allowing them to show the movie on a white cloth placed in the store's window.  As their film ends, Mr. Fletcher, Mike and Jerry exit the store to find a crowd has gathered in the street to watch the film through the window, including the city official and wrecking crew, and they are given a rousing applause by the gathered crowd.

 The villages of Charmoussey and Super-Charmoussey (Upper Charmoussey) have been longtime rivals despite the fact that many of their inhabitants are related to each other. While Charmoussey is relatively poor, Upper-Charmoussey enjoys the luxuries of a [[ski resort]] and thus a better economy than its sister village. The rivalry is also stressed because of the local [[beauty contest|beauty pageant]], where the better trained and dressed girls of Upper-Charmoussey always win the contest. Since the size of both [[municipalities]] is very small, the local government has decided to merge Charmoussey into Upper-Charmoussey, this leaves the inhabitants of Charmoussey desperate because it is their last chance to win the beauty contest. In order to achieve that, they call the only person who has had any success outside the village, Franck ([[Benoît Poelvoorde]]) a second rate actor, who has been engaged mostly as an extra in many films (playing dead people) and is currently down on his luck after causing an accident that resulted in breaking the leg of actress [[Catherine Deneuve]] (his biggest role so far).  It is revealed that he left the village because he was regarded as strange and because his father was an eccentric scientist who died in trying a flying suit. He feels uneasy at coming back to his hometown but also recognizes that he cannot afford not to, so he uses his limited [[Show business|showbiz]] knowledge to train the local girls. Meanwhile, the inhabitants of Upper-Charmoussey have learned from the local postman that Franck has been engaged in training the contestants and start a counter espionage campaign of their own.

Bedtime Stories (film)
 Skeeter Bronson ([[Adam Sandler]]) is a hotel maintenance man who is promised as a child by his father Marty ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) to be the manager of the family hotel, but later it is bought by hotel chain Nottingham Hotels. 25 years later, the new manager Barry Nottingham ([[Richard Griffiths]]) plans to build a new hotel and appoints another man, the snotty Kendall Duncan ([[Guy Pearce]]) to become the manager, simply because he is dating his daughter, Violet ([[Teresa Palmer]]).  Skeeter's sister Wendy ([[Courteney Cox]]) asks him to watch her kids (who own a [[guinea pig]] with huge eyes named Bugsy), because the school at which she is the principal is being closed and she is looking for a job in Arizona. The first night, Skeeter tells a bedtime story taking place in medieval times (with him as the main character; in this case, an underdog peasant named Sir Fix-A-Lot), with some additions from her kids. The next day, the entire story miraculously comes true. Nottingham gives Skeeter a shot at the manager position when he says his new hotel theme was taken by [[Hard Rock Hotel]] and on his way home (though it actually came from a truck crash) it rains gumballs on top of him, all from the story.  The next night, at the hotel, he tells another story set in the Old West, and when he waits for it to come true, a man dressed in Indian attire steals his wallet. He saves Violet from an obnoxious paparazzi and gets kicked by a dwarf. He also spots a Ferrari car, and thought he was being offered it for free (like in the story) but Violet drives away with it (implying that it was actually her car).  The night after that, out on a campfire near the hotel, he tells them about a Greek chariot-riding stuntman, and he ends up falling for his sister's friend and colleague Jill ([[Keri Russell]]).  On the last night with the kids, he tells them about a space fight in which he triumphs over Kendall. After he wins the gig of manager (despite his presentation being flawed due to a bee stinging his tongue), he makes the discovery from Kendall that the new Nottingham Hotel will be at the location of the closing school. After being dismissed by Nottingham (for inadvertently destroying his birthday cake), which turned out to be the connection to the ending of the space story (at which he originally thought he would combust), he gets the hotel moved to Santa Monica, and then with Jill is able to avert the demolition, saving the school and his nephew and niece, while getting his wallet and money back from the same man that stole it from him earlier.  Sometime later, he marries Jill and establishes a motel named after his late father. Kendall and his accomplice Aspen ([[Lucy Lawless]]) are demoted to the motel's waiting staff. Violet marries Skeeter's best friend Mickey ([[Russell Brand]]), giving him control of the Nottingham Empire, becoming the ninth richest man alive. In the meantime, Nottingham quits hotel management to become a school nurse and newlywed Skeeter and Jill have a baby, while Bugsy the guinea pig marries too, and has a bunch of babies.

Beethoven's Big Break
 Eddie, a struggling animal trainer and widowed father, is an assistant animal trainer to Sal DeMarco, an untalented, egocentric animal show host. Both men have been hired to train the animals for a film called ''Frizzy, The Bichon Frise'': Sal as the dog handler, and Eddie is given only the responsibility of training the lizard. When Frizzy is kidnapped, Sal quickly claims that Eddie was responsible for the dog handling. Eddie is promptly fired. The director refuses to pay the ransom and decides to instead hold auditions for the new Frizzy.  Meanwhile, Eddie's son, Billy, is walking around town when he discovers a large, stray dog is following him. Billy then brings the dog home and names him [[Beethoven (film)|Beethoven]] after the dog shows interest in [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Ludwig van Beethoven's 5th symphony]], after initially trying to call him Wolfgang. Eddie comes home to discover that, not only is his job gone, but now his house is wrecked by an oversized dog adopted by his son.  We will soon learn that the one responsible for Frizzy's disappearance is Sal, accompanied by his two other cronies. He admonishes them for not waiting until Frizzy had already shot ''some'' of the movie, in order to make her valuable.  The next day, when auditions are held, the director has trouble finding the right dog to replace Frizzy. Eddie has arrived (with Billy and Beethoven in-tow) to pick up his lizard, Pete. Suddenly, Beethoven bursts in and performs an impressive chase scene with Pete the Lizard, which instantly makes the director love him. Beethoven and Eddie are hired on the spot, and Sal is fired.  To celebrate, Eddie takes Billy and Beethoven out for hamburgers, but Beethoven escapes with the burgers and leads Eddie and Billy on a chase. Finally, they find where Beethoven was going: he had been caring for his three small pups in an alley, as their mother had apparently died. In ''Beethoven's 2nd'', she wasn't heard from again. Eddie begrudgingly adopts the puppies, as well.  Eddie is then charged with having Beethoven perform the requested stunts in the movie. Unfortunately, Beethoven proves to be "untrainable", and instead, often crashes through the scene and making a sloppy mess in the process. Each time, Eddie is prepared to be fired, but the director finds these scenes even more funny and orders the scenes printed for the film. Lisa, the film's writer, requests from Eddie to spend more time with Beethoven so that she can write more appropriately for him.  As revenge for being fired, Sal orders his henchmen to kidnap Beethoven for the million-dollar ransom, planning to kill him after the ransom is paid. They kidnap him while Billy is flirting with his crush in the park. Eddie, Billy, Lisa and the puppies then head to Sal's show stage, which doubles as his secret lair, and rescue Beethoven. Sal and his goons are arrested, and Eddie and Lisa begin a relationship.  The film ends with Eddie, Lisa, Billy, Katie, Beethoven, the pups, and Pete the [[iguana]], all enjoying snacks while watching the film's premiere.  The end credits have movie title parodies. These include [[WALL-E|Dog-E]], [[When Harry Met Sally...|When Hairy Met Frizzy]] and [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Lizard of Oz]]. During the Gag Reel, Jonathan Silverman refers to Sal DeMarco as "Ned Ryerson". This is because the actor who played Sal, Stephen Tobolowsky, portrayed the character Ned Ryerson in the [[Bill Murray]] comedy, [[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]].

The Black Balloon (film)
 Fifteen-year-old Thomas Mollison ([[Rhys Wakefield]]) and his family move to a new home in the early 1990s. It begins with Charlie, his autistic brother, banging a wooden spoon on the grass with neighbors staring and pointing. Then, it cuts to the house where there are locks on the drawers and Maggie, their mother, locking star-shaped stickers in her bathroom cabinet. Thomas is anxious because he has to start at a new school, and make new friends. All he wants to do is fit in and be regarded in the same way as everyone else. However, it seems he struggles to achieve this goal. Although his family appears to be a fairly happy one, Thomas often feels isolated; it seems as if his mother only dotes upon his brother, Charlie ([[Luke Ford (actor)|Luke Ford]]), and does not pay any attention to him. However, Thomas is devoted to his brother and shows affection for him. Charlie is Thomas's older brother who lives with [[autism]], as well as [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention deficit disorder]]. Charlie enjoys dressing up like a monkey, playing computer games using a [[Commodore 64]] and receiving gold stars for good behaviour. Charlie communicates with the rest of his family by using [[sign language]].  When their heavily [[pregnancy|pregnant]] mother, Maggie ([[Toni Collette]]), must take a rest owing to a recommendation by her doctor as a consequence of Maggie's [[high blood pressure]], Thomas is put in charge of Charlie. Thomas finds this task difficult and onerous. For example, when Charlie flees from the house in a high-spirited mood, Thomas runs after him to ensure the safety of his brother. Thomas cannot keep up with Charlie. Matters become even more problematic when Charlie expresses the urge to go to the bathroom and enters the nearest house to use the [[toilet]]. When he does so, the brothers encounter Jackie ([[Gemma Ward]]) who is taking a shower. The fact that both brothers are only wearing their [[underwear]] is a source of severe embarrassment for Thomas.  Jackie exhibits her interest in Thomas when she attends a [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] class at school and visits Thomas at his home to return Charlie's monkey hat he left when he used Jackie's toilet. Thomas's first response is to ensure that his brother is hidden away from Jackie. However, Maggie is less than thrilled when she discovers that Thomas has locked Charlie in his bedroom. She then sees Charlie proceeding to rub his own [[human feces|faeces]] into the carpet. Thomas becomes frustrated and tells Maggie that Charlie is her responsibility. Maggie replies that Charlie will never be able to have a job, nor a family. He will be more likely to remain living with his parents for the rest of his life.  This latest episode proves too much for Maggie. Her husband, Simon, insists that she spend the rest of her pregnancy in the [[hospital]] instead, leaving Thomas to become the primary caregiver for Charlie. Thomas begins to enter into Charlie's world when he rides the bus for children with various disabilities with his brother. In addition, Thomas is seen dealing with Charlie, who has a [[tantrum|meltdown]] due to Simon not buying some more items at a local [[supermarket]] since he does not have enough money. This again causes severe embarrassment for Thomas. That same evening when the trio return from the supermarket, Thomas, who was annoyed by the meltdown, rips up Charlie's star chart. This causes things to become worse when the brothers fight and Charlie throws a stool through the window. The next day, when Thomas attends his [[swimming (sport)|swimming class]], Jackie wears Charlie's monkey ears, which pleases and amuses him. When Jackie meets Charlie, she makes a concerted effort to know and understand him, as well as to use Sign Language as a means by which to communicate with him.  Thomas and his father both endeavour to care for Charlie together. Simon tells Thomas that his mother is grateful to have Charlie as a child because she feels that the family is strong enough to be able to look after him. Representatives from Youth and Community Services visit the house and state that they have received multiple complaints about Charlie. Simon is furious at his neighbour whom he attributes responsibility for the invasive visit. Thomas also displays his loyalty to his brother. Charlie accompanies Jackie and Thomas to swim in a river. When it rains, they all shelter in a nearby drainpipe where Jackie and Thomas share their first kiss. When the boys arrive home, there is a note taped to the television which states that Maggie has given birth to a girl.  When Thomas sees Charlie at his school, Charlie becomes the victim of malicious taunting and harassment. Jackie tells Thomas that he needs to quit wishing that Charlie was "normal." Tensions flare when Jackie eats a [[roast dinner]] with the family in order to celebrate Thomas's sixteenth birthday. Jackie wonders whether or not Charlie will ever speak again. Thomas is confident that Charlie will if everyone will stop communicating with him using Sign Language. When Charlie begins [[masturbation|masturbating]] at the table, this causes Jackie to become extremely uncomfortable. Also, Thomas becomes irate and smashes Charlie's [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] console, leading to a fight between the brothers. After a physical altercation between the two brothers, Maggie exhibits sympathy for both of her sons. In spite of his mother's commiseration, Thomas still feels as if he behaved badly. In the morning, Thomas joins Charlie in his morning activity: sitting in the backyard while banging a wooden spoon on the ground.  The family attend a school musical production entitled "Animals Afloat," in which Charlie portrays a monkey. After Charlie's theatrical partner, Russell, has a meltdown on stage, Thomas and Charlie both don monkey costumes and give an outstanding performance. The brothers celebrate their success by taking a [[bubble bath]] together. Thomas confesses to his brother that when he was little, he used to fall asleep at night, wishing that Charlie would be normal. Charlie looks thoughtful.

Bleach: Fade to Black
 In the Soul Society, Soul Reaper scientist [[Mayuri Kurotsuchi]] is attacked in his laboratory by a pair of mysterious siblings wielding a scythe that erases his memories. In a frightened panic, Kurotsuchi damages one of his machines, causing a massive spirit energy explosion that covers much of Soul Society, killing or freezing many Soul Reapers. [[Rukia Kuchiki]] is the next to be attacked by the siblings, erasing her memories and those of everybody that has memories of her, and is carried away to Soul Society's Rukon District by the siblings.   In the real world, one of Rukia's friends, [[Ichigo Kurosaki]], briefly forgets her but Kon, being a modified soul, is unaffected by the memory wipe and reminds him. Ichigo and Kon go to former Soul Reaper [[Kisuke Urahara]] for information; but Urahara does not remember Rukia. Ichigo and Kon travel to the Soul Society with all the captains unable to remember Ichigo, believing him to be a threat. Meanwhile, Rukia wakes up in the Rukon District with no memory of being a Soul Reaper. The nameless siblings, a sister and a brother, remind Rukia that they used to be close friends living together and she was to give them names, although she has forgotten them. Ichigo seeks the help of Rukia's adopted brother, [[Byakuya Kuchiki|Byakuya]], but he does not remember Rukia either. After another confronting with [[Renji Abarai]], Rukia's chilhood friend, Byakuya directs Ichigo to his wife, Hisana's, birthplace, where they are briefly reunited with Rukia before the siblings flee with her from Ichigo and Kon.  Ichigo and Kon are attacked again by other Soul Reapers, but are saved by Renji Abarai, who follows his instinct to trust Ichigo. When Soul Society's head-captain and other captains arrive to capture Ichigo, Urahara interferes. He sends Ichigo, Renji and Kon off to save Rukia, and explains to the captains that he studied a parasitic Hollow which could erase memories with its scythe-like tentacle, but it escaped and appears to be influencing the siblings' actions to an extent. Meanwhile, the siblings go to Kurotsuchi's laboratory to fully destroy the Soul Reapers with another spiritual machine of Kurotsuchi's, under the belief that the Soul Reapers were responsible for taking Rukia away from them when they were younger. Rukia suddenly objects to this, and Ichigo and Renji's arrival prompts her to remember them and her entire past, with both the siblings and her time as a Soul Reaper. The female sibling succumbs to rage, and she forces herself, her brother and Rukia to all fuse into one, creating "[[Rukia Kuchiki#In other media|Dark Rukia]]".   Dark Rukia, seemingly hollowified, unleashes the machine upon Soul Society before battling Ichigo. The machine takes the form of a monster, and the Soul Reapers fight against it. Ichigo fights Dark Rukia and holds back initially to refrain from injuring her. Byakuya arrives and claims that he should be the one to finish this, but Ichigo intervenes and manages to free her with his own similar spirit energy, destroying the Hollow; Byakuya and Renji also destroy the monster. Rukia regains her memories, but the siblings are left mortally wounded, though they are regretful for their actions. Urahara arrives and explains that the Hollow attacked Rukia and the siblings while controlling a Soul Reaper's body previously, but when the body was destroyed, the siblings trapped the Hollow in their bodies and were sent to Hueco Mundo—the Hollow's world—for a time, managing to escape to reunite with Rukia because of their desire to be with her. Rukia tells the siblings their names, Homura and Shizuku, but the two die from their wounds, much to Rukia's despair. Later, Ichigo asks Rukia at the hill shrine where she previously visited before, about the shrines were made in remembrance of her childhood friends who died during adolescence due to poverty, reminding her that her memories of the siblings will not fade.

It is quickly revealed that until recently he had a well-paid job, and a wife named Lou and two daughters. His family were drowned, however, in a freak storm on a boating holiday that Peter was meant to be on. This causes him to withdraw from society and he is rendered unable to speak. He sticks to a regular but lonely routine until one day he discovers that a lifeboat containing a little girl of about seven called Charlotte has landed on the island. Charlotte refuses to leave the island until her father comes to pick her up, so she stays with Peter. After just over a week, he finds out from a radio broadcast that she is the only survivor from a sinking ship, and that the girl's father is dead. It is at this point he becomes able to speak again. During this time the two have formed a bond, and so when Charlotte refuses to leave, he decides that she can stay. This is possible as no-one else knows that she is alive. At the end of the film Peter has to persuade his food supplier to keep quiet about the little girl's presence on the island so she is not taken away by the authorities, he agrees and the film ends showing the viewer several "family snapshots" of an adult Charlotte and an older Peter, thus implying that she remained with him for the rest of her childhood.

Blindness (2008 film)
 A young Japanese professional is struck blind in his car at a crossing and is then approached by a few people, one offers to drive him home and steals his car. The blinded man describes his sudden affliction as an expanse of dazzling white. Upon arriving home and noticing her husband's blindness, the man's wife takes him to a local ophthalmologist who, after testing the man's eyes, can identify nothing wrong and recommends further evaluation at a hospital. Among the doctor's patients are an old man with a black eye-patch, a woman with dark glasses, and a young boy. During a dinner with his wife, the doctor discusses the strange case. The woman with dark glasses, revealed to be a call-girl, becomes the third victim of the strange blindness after an appointment with a [[Prostitution#Etymology and terminology|john]] in a hotel.  The next day, the doctor goes blind as well. Around the city, more citizens are struck blind, causing widespread panic, and the government organizes a quarantine for the blind in a derelict asylum. When a [[hazmat suit|hazmat]] crew arrives to pick up the doctor, his wife climbs into the van, lying that she has gone blind in order to accompany him.  In the asylum, the doctor and his wife are first to arrive and both agree they will keep her sight a secret. Several others arrive: the woman with dark glasses, the Japanese man, the car thief, and the young boy. The wife comes across the old man with the eye-patch, who describes the condition of the world outside. The sudden blindness, known as the "white sickness", is now international, with hundreds of cases reported every day. The increasingly totalitarian government resorts to increasingly ruthless measures to try to staunch the epidemic, refusing the sick aid or medicines.  As more blind people are crammed into the prison, overcrowding and lack of outside support causes hygiene and living conditions to degrade. Soon, the walls and floors are caked in filth and human feces. Anxiety over the availability of food undermines the morale and the lack of organization prevents the fair distribution of food. The soldiers who guard the asylum become hostile.  Living conditions degenerate further when a clique of ward-3 men, armed with one handgun held by an ex-barman who declares himself the king of ward, gains control over the food deliveries. The MRE rations are distributed only in exchange for the other wards' valuables, and then for sex with the women of the other wards. When one of the women is beaten to death by the man having the coerced sex with her, the doctor's wife has had enough and soon kills the king with scissors to the neck. His death initiates a chaotic war confrontation between the wards, which culminates with ward-3 and then most of the building being burned down and some inmates dying in the fire. The survivors discover that the guards have abandoned their posts and they are free to venture into the city.  Society has degenerated as the entire population is blind amid a city devastated and overrun with filth and dead bodies. The doctor's wife leads her husband and others from her ward in search of food and shelter. The doctor and his wife arrive in a supermarket filled with stumbling blind people and they find food in a basement storeroom. As she prepares to leave and meet her husband outside, she is attacked by the starving people who smell the food she is carrying. Her husband, now used to his blindness, saves her and they manage to return to their friends.  The doctor and his wife with their new "family" make their way back to the doctor's house, where they establish a mutually supportive permanent home. The next day, just as suddenly as his sight had been lost, the Japanese man recovers his sight. As the friends all celebrate, the doctor's wife stands out on the porch, staring up into a white overcast sky and seems to be going blind until the camera shifts downwards, revealing that she sees the cityscape.

Bolt (2008 film)
  A [[White Shepherd]] puppy named [[Bolt (Disney character)|Bolt]] is adopted by a seven-year-old girl named Penny. Five years later, Bolt and Penny star in a hit television series called ''Bolt'', in which Bolt uses various [[superpower]]s to protect Penny from the villain. To gain a more realistic performance, the show's producers have deceived Bolt his entire life, arranging the filming in such a way that Bolt believes everything in the show is real and that he really has superpowers, including a devastatingly powerful sonic scream-like "superbark". After a [[cliffhanger]] episode causes Bolt to believe Penny has been kidnapped, he escapes from his on-set trailer in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] but knocks himself unconscious and is trapped inside a box of [[foam peanut]]s which is shipped to New York City.  In New York, Bolt resumes his search for Penny and quickly finds that his "superpowers" are useless. He encounters Mittens, a [[feral cat]] who bullies pigeons out of their food. Bolt compels Mittens to guide him back to Penny — Mittens being convinced her captor is a lunatic — and the two start their journey westward by truck. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, Penny is distraught over Bolt's disappearance but is convinced by the studio to continue filming with a less experienced Bolt lookalike.  Surprised at his first feelings of hunger, Bolt is shown by Mittens how to act like a cute but needy dog, obtaining food for them both at an [[RV park]]. They are joined by Rhino, a fearless hamster and fanatical ''Bolt'' fan. Rhino's unwavering faith in Bolt substantiates the dog’s illusions about his superpowers, but causes Mittens to realize that Bolt is from a television show. She tries to tell Bolt that his superpowers are not real, but Bolt simply becomes frustrated and attempts to "superbark" her repeatedly. The noise draws the attention of an [[Animal Control]] patrol and Bolt and Mittens are captured and taken to an animal shelter.  Bolt, freed from the patrol van by Rhino, finally realizes and accepts that he is just a normal dog, but regains his confidence after Rhino (oblivious to this revelation) exhorts him to [[heroism]]. They rescue Mittens from the shelter, and as they continue west, Bolt and Mittens form a close friendship in which she teaches Bolt how to be an ordinary dog and enjoy typical dog activities. Mittens makes plans for them to stay in [[Las Vegas]], but hearing Bolt is still drawn to find Penny, she tells him that Penny is only an [[actor]], and that humans never truly love their pets but betray and abandon them, as happened to her. Bolt refuses to believe her and continues on alone to Hollywood; with Rhino's encouragement his two friends follow shortly after.  Bolt reaches the studio and finds Penny embracing his lookalike. Unaware that Penny still misses him and that her affection for the lookalike is only a part of a rehearsal, he leaves. Mittens, on a gantry in the studio, sees Penny telling her mother how much she misses Bolt. Realizing that Penny truly does love Bolt, Mittens follows Bolt and explains. At the same time, the Bolt-lookalike panics during the show's filming and accidentally knocks over some [[torch|flaming torches]], setting the sound stage on fire with Penny trapped inside. Bolt arrives and the two reunite inside the burning studio, but are unable to escape before Penny begins to suffocate from the smoke. Bolt refuses to leave her, and with his last strength, uses his "superbark" through the building's [[air vent]]. Hearing the noise, the firefighters rescue them in time.  Penny and her mother quit when their overeager agent attempts to exploit the incident for publicity purposes. The show continues with a replacement "Bolt" and "Penny" and [[jumping the shark|a new storyline]] involving [[alien abduction]]. Penny adopts Mittens and Rhino, and she and her family move to a rural home to enjoy a simpler, happy lifestyle with Bolt and her new pets.  
Body of Lies (film)
 Roger Ferris ([[Leonardo DiCaprio]]) is a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] case officer in [[Iraq]], tracking a terrorist called Al-Saleem ([[Alon Abutbul]]). He meets Nizar, a member of the terrorist organization who is prepared to offer information in return for [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in North America. Despite his boss, Ed Hoffman's ([[Russell Crowe]]) objections, Ferris agrees to shelter Nizar. Nizar is used as a pawn to draw out the rest of his cell; when he is captured, Ferris is forced to shoot him to prevent him from exposing Ferris' identity. However, furious at Hoffman's refusal to act on the information Nizar provided, Ferris and his associate Bassam ([[Oscar Isaac]]) go to search a safe house in Balad, Iraq, of which Nizar had told them. There, Ferris observes men burning records and attempts to bluff his way in, but is exposed. In the ensuing shootout and chase, Ferris and Bassam's vehicle is hit by an RPG. Ferris and some salvaged discs are rescued by helicopter but Bassam is killed in the explosion.  Meanwhile, unknown terrorists in the UK plan to follow up on bus bombings in [[Sheffield]] with more attacks in [[Manchester]], but blow themselves up when the police arrive at their house. Recovered from his injuries, Ferris is assigned to Jordan to continue searching for Al-Saleem, where he meets with Hani Salaam ([[Mark Strong]]), head of the Jordanian [[General Intelligence Directorate (Jordan)|General Intelligence Directorate]].  Hoffman finds an Al-Saleem safe house in Jordan and orders Ferris to watch it. Simultaneously, Hoffman organizes another 'side operation' via a local agency operative named Skip ([[Vince Colosimo]]) and that he is to conduct an operation without Ferris' knowledge. Skip employs the use of an agency asset, Ziyad Abishi, who blows cover to a terrorist from the safe house. As he flees to inform his colleagues of their exposure, Ferris makes chase and kills him in such a place and manner that one might believe the death to be random. Salaam (via 'back channels') corroborates the acceptance of killing by those who remain at the safe house; and Ferris accuses Hoffman of running "side operations" which interfere and (at least) undermine operational integrity of primary operation and tells Hoffman to stop. While going to the hospital to receive rabies shots for bites suffered during the pursuit and elimination of the terrorist, Ferris meets a nurse named Aisha ([[Golshifteh Farahani]]), and he begins developing romantic feelings for her. The bombers strike again in an [[Amsterdam]] flower market, and kill at least 75 people.  Having recognized one of the men living in the safe house as former small-time criminal Mustaffa Karami ([[Kais Nashef]]), Salaam takes Karami into the desert and coerces him into working for Jordanian intelligence, threatening to set him up as a collaborator if he does not co-operate. Hoffman asks Salaam to use Karami, but he refuses, believing a greater return will come later. Unknown to Ferris and Salaam, Hoffman tells Ferris' CIA subordinate (Skip) to follow Karami and kidnap him. Karami escapes and notifies the terrorists in the safe house that it is being watched, and they abandon it. Ferris's partner is caught and Salaam accuses Ferris of having had knowledge of the move on Karami, and blames Ferris's duplicity with him for the destruction of the safe house. He exiles Ferris from Jordan.  Ferris returns to Hoffman in Washington, and they devise a new plan to find Al-Saleem. Suspecting he is motivated more by pride than ideology, they stage a fake terrorist attack and set up Omar Sadiki ([[Ali Suliman]]), an innocent Jordanian architect, as its instigator, hoping Al-Saleem will come out of hiding and attempt to contact him. Al-Saleem sees TV news coverage of the attack and takes the bait.  Salaam invites Ferris back to Jordan and shares his suspicions that Omar Sadiki is a terrorist, though Ferris feigns ignorance. Ferris later tries to save Sadiki from being kidnapped by Al-Saleem's henchmen but fails and sees his partner nearly killed in the subsequent car crash. Under interrogation, Sadiki denies any knowledge of the attack though he is later found beaten and killed. Ferris goes back to his apartment and finds out that Aisha has been kidnapped. He desperately asks Salaam for help, admitting he fabricated Omar Sadiki's terrorist cell and the attack. Salaam refuses to help because of Ferris earlier having lied to him.  Ferris offers himself in exchange to Aisha's kidnappers, and is brought to the middle of the desert, with Hoffman watching everything via a surveillance [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]. Ferris is surrounded by a group of SUVs, which circle him to create an obscuring dust cloud before picking him up. The dust cloud blocks Hoffman's view, so that he cannot determine which of the SUVs, now headed in different directions, is carrying Ferris. Ferris is taken across the border to [[Syria]] where he is to be interrogated by Al-Saleem. When Ferris asks Al-Saleem about Aisha, he is told that someone has lied to him and that he has been double-crossed. Ferris tells Al-Saleem that there is an infiltrator (Karami) in his organization who works for Ferris, and that, by association, Al-Saleem works for Ferris. Al-Saleem does not believe Ferris, beats him, turns on a video camera and orders his execution. Salaam and his agents arrive at the last moment, saving Ferris' life. Al-Saleem is shown arrested in his own SUV by Marwan Se-Kia, Hani Salaam's security officer.  Salaam visits Ferris in the hospital and reveals he had faked Aisha's abduction, and orchestrated Ferris's capture by Al-Saleem using Karami as a go-between. Having lost the will to fight in this particular 'war', Ferris goes off the grid and goes to see Aisha again.

 The opening scene is shown in a way that director Rana ([[Nana Patekar]]) shoots a scene in his upcoming film with his film's heroine. As he is not happy with the way the heroine behaves, he decides to find another heroine. In search of the heroine, he finally finds Trishna ([[Rukmini Vijayakumar]]) suited for his film, but he never discloses the identity of his heroine to media, and the wallpapers of the film also don't show the hero as well as the heroine of the film. Finally, the film gets completed, and Rana needs to attend a press meet regarding his film's release, but he does not go the press meet and he is shown to have had an illegal relationship with Trishna. At this instant, the producer of the film calls him and the media come to know where he is and with whom. So the whole media people gathers at the hotel where Rana stays and he manages to escape from them and get into a car. They start chasing him, and finally he kills Trishna by creating an accident-like situation. In this situation, SP Vivek Verma ([[Arjun Sarja]]), a CBI officer takes charge for this murder case, along with two previous murder cases which was also suspected to be done by Rana. As a suspicion, he is arrested and taken into CBI custody. There Vivek starts his interrogation. In between this, a poet Anitha ([[Kajal Aggarwal]]), who is also a crazy fan of Rana is shown as Vivek's lover and also she was an assistant to Rana during his film shooting. Finally during interrogation, Rana reveals of how he found Trishna and their relationship. She was a dancer, who used to dance in temples and small-time shows across Andhra Pradesh. He hires her as his new muse, and in the shooting spot, they are shown to share a very intimate relationship, fueling existing rumors that he is a womanizer. When a hairdresser is left without a place to sleep, Rana offers her a place in his room, and witnessing this, another unit member informs Rana's wife ([[Ranjitha]]). The next morning, as Rana is once again shown to share a very close rapport with Trishna, his wife arrives, beats up the hairdresser, and throws a tantrum, accusing him as a womanizer. He however continues shooting, appearing to be unperturbed by the incident but apparently cries lightly while instructing his actors, something which his assistant notices. He and his assistant are also shown to share a special and close relationship, as she comforts him later on. However, at the same village in which they are shooting, they face troubles in the form of the village chief ([[Manivannan]]), who is notorious and constantly lusting over Trishna. He states in rage at one point that he would kill the chief should he cause more inconvenience. The next day, the chief is murdered at a nearby quarry. Vivek recalls this and states that Rana committed this murder because he can't stand the chief's behavior towards Trishna, but Rana neither agrees or denies this statement.  Rana is later admitted to the hospital as he faints shortly after that interrogation, but Vivek pursues him even in the hospital, and recollects the incident of the second murder. After finishing their schedule at the village, the unit heads to Malaysia to continue their shooting for 'Cinema'. There, Rana has to meet another nuisance in terms of the financier's son, who is also the film's second hero. He flirts around with Trishna and tries to constantly approach her, of which she is obviously uncomfortable with, and shortly afterwards, he is found murdered as well. Once again, Rana neither denies or agrees as Vivek accuses him of murder. Rana's assistant, upon witnessing what Vivek is doing, confronts him and accuses him of trying to pin down Rana in jealousy. She offers her body in exchange of Rana being left alone, but Vivek reveals to her the complication that exist in the investigation. The badly burnt body in the car which fell from the cliff belongs to a man and not a woman, and all the evidence that exists at the crime scene are all fake, which are used for cinema.  With the mystery lingering, Rana is released due to the absence of strong evidence to convict him. He goes off to live in a secluded bungalow with his assistant, who describes theirs as a 'special' relationship. Vivek arrives there too and finally uncovers the mystery. Trishna is revealed as a boy, and not a girl. Babu, being his real name, comes from a very poor background, and his mother raised him as a woman since childhood, thus his demeanor has become womanly since small. Rana, in him, sees an opportunity to take up a unique challenge by introducing him as a heroine and at the same time provide financial aid to his struggling family. Babu killed the village chief after the chief discovers Babu's gender identity and demands that Babu, despite being a boy, still sleep with him in return of the truth not being revealed in public. And when the financier's son tells him that he has taken his picture while he is bathing (which he actually did not), Babu became insecure once again and kills him too. Rana asks Vivek to give the boy the least available sentence, but Vivek, overwhelmed by the truth, decides to let the boy go. Rana thanked Vivek, but Vivek in return says Rana is a greater human being than he is a director.

Scared, Audrey gets out and goes to her room to sleep. Her dog, however, is up and wants to play ball. To get him away she throw the ball in the closet; after a while, she gets worried her dog hasn't come back yet. She walks to the closet and finds blood lining it. She backs away and, with a scream, gets pulled under her bed.  Sarah Morris ([[Erin Cahill]]) is a student who is doing a radio show for her college radio station where she tries to help people with their problems, such as a guy just breaking up with his girlfriend. Soon after she is introduced, Audrey arrives in Sarah’s room at night, raving that “He’s everywhere”. Sarah lets her stay the night. During Sarah’s radio show the next day, Audrey calls to tell Sarah and Dr. Kane about the [[Boogeyman]]. They don’t believe her, but Sarah goes to find her, thinking she is suicidal, while Dr. Kane remains with her on the phone. The Boogeyman then begins to strangle Audrey when Sarah arrives. When others arrive to see it, Audrey appears to have hung herself.  Soon after, Sarah discovers a diary amongst Audrey’s things. Upon reading it, she begins to believe the Boogeyman is real, and tries to warn her friends and boyfriend, David ([[Chuck Hittinger]]). They refuse to believe her thinking she is dealing with the trauma of her friend dying soon after her mother‘s death. Her friends in the dorm begin to disappear, as Sarah has visions of their deaths through being pulled into the alternate world of the Boogeyman.  People refuse to believe her claims but campus talk of the Boogeyman from hearing her radio show continues to swirl. Sarah begins to believe the Boogeyman gains his power from the legend continuing by people believing he might be real. Dr. Kane begins to worry about her mental stability.  Sarah takes over the radio station to warn the students away, prompting her arrest by campus security. While held in custody, Dr. Kane negotiates her release until the body of Sarah’s friend Lindsey is found in a washer. Sarah realizes Dr. Kane is actually beginning to believe when they both witness a light manifestation of the Boogeyman. Dr. Kane, trying to prove she is wrong, enters the room where the light is, and is subsequently beaten to death by the Boogeyman. Sarah then realizes the Boogeyman has been using her fear to warn everyone in order to get everyone to believe in him.  Sarah rushes back to her room to save David, who now believes her story and has been reading the diary. She finds him staring off into a black closet, but is unable to prevent the Boogeyman from pulling him in. David is soon-after flung out into the room, disemboweled, covering her in blood. The police and students arrive to find the scene. To prevent the Boogeyman’s growth in power, Sarah claims she committed all the murders herself and that the Boogeyman is not real. One of the officers in the elevator reveals he doesn’t believe she could have done that by herself. She insists that she did, but the elevator stops and she is pulled up into the elevator shaft by the Boogeyman, while the two police officers stare in disbelief as Sarah cries for help fades away.  One year later, Amy ([[Jayne Wisener]]) and Jennifer ([[Kate Maberly]]) are staying in Sarah’s room. Amy interrupts Jennifer's studies to tell her the story of the “crazy girl” (Sarah) who thought the Boogeyman was real that lived in the room a year ago. It is revealed the college changed the dorm name to keep people from being afraid to move in. Jennifer leaves to go to the library for some peace, noticing that Amy actually seems scared to be alone and taunting her as she leaves. Left alone, Amy is soon attacked and dragged by the Boogeyman beneath her bed to an unknown fate.  
The Book of Caleb
 At the dawn of his quarter-life crisis, Caleb Callahan (Jeremy Luno) returns home to Bucks County after recently dropping out of college. Upon his return, he discovers a note from his lifelong friends Montag (Michael Hampton) and Swank (Nikitas Manikatos) to meet and catch up on old times. Montag, an eccentric man-child and serial prankster, requests that Caleb joins him and Swank on one of his many schemes. After seeing his old bandana mask from his pranking days with the two, Caleb agrees to join them.  Caleb, dressed in cape and mask, distracts the Washington Elementary School’s noon aids and causes bedlam among the students with a soapbox speech on recess grounds. Meanwhile, Montag and Swank discover a map that leads to an old time capsule after randomly searching the principal’s office. Caleb (having escaped from the noon aids’ clutches), return inside the school to return an old overdue library book, When the Leaves Fall. He hears music, following it to the school’s music room to find Cole ([[Mackenzie Firgens]]) playing piano, he’s speechless by her presence. The trio are immediately confronted by Cole’s father, the principal of the Washington Elementary, but they escape his clutches and their scheme a success. Later that night at Sherrwood Tavern, Caleb and Swank go out for drinks and darts. Caleb, an avid darts player, shows Swank how to play, only to be disrupted by Officer Scar (Jeff Berg), Caleb’s old arch nemesis. Scar, the dart champion of Sherrwood, prevents them from further playing, who nightly guards the area by the dartboard to prevent possible rivals at the game. As they leave, Caleb runs into Cole, who runs a nighttime taxi service to prevent drunks from roaming the streets. Cole playfully informs Caleb that she has his book (left behind after his confrontation with her father), and Caleb responds by saying he’ll call her tomorrow.  While Montag discusses his next scheme with Caleb and Swank at the park, Montag gets into a fight with his long-time rival, the obnoxious Tanner (Billy Tanner) after being loudly insulted by him. Meanwhile, Caleb sees James Paddington ([[Paul Gleason]]), the county’s gubernatorial candidate, discussing to a crowd of potential voters the history of the Revolutionary War and the town’s history behind it. Caleb argues with Paddington that Washington’s attack on the British was considered cheating for fighting on Christmas. After Paddington publicly berates Montag and Swank before the crowd, Caleb says out of all the pranks Montag has done in the past, their upcoming scheme against Paddington is the one he can truly agree on.  At 2:00&nbsp;a.m., Montag and Swank hide on a stakeout by Caleb’s house where they are interrogated by Scar. Scar informs Montag that he knows that he was behind the trespassing at Washington Elementary, and warns that the next scheme they concoct, he ''will'' intervene. Caleb and Cole begin seeing each other more and more and eventually become lovers, much to Montag’s annoyance. Caleb introduces Cole to Montag and Swank so they can get to know her, but Scar intervenes, revealing to Caleb that he had a relationship with Cole before him, reveling in Caleb’s anger at this revelation.  Caleb, Cole and the others return to Sherrwood Tavern for drinks and darts where they again run into Scar, who prevents them from further playing. Cole insults Scar by proclaiming that Caleb will take his dart champion title from him. They play a single match, with Scar being victorious. When Cole asks Caleb about his history with Scar and of the diamond shaped scar on his cheek, Caleb refuses to answer, considering the inquiry to be rude. As Caleb leaves for the restroom, Swank reveals to Cole their history with Scar dating back from high school. Montag challenged Scar and his crew to a basketball match, only to lose miserably. As Scar reveled in his victory, Montag shoved Scar, only to receive a beating in retaliation. Caleb defends Montag by throwing a garbage can at Scar, the impact pushed Scar's face against a wire fence and ripped a bloody diamond shaped mark into his left cheek. Humiliated, Scar swears vengeance against Caleb and his friends and disappears.  Wintertime, Caleb and Cole meets up with Montag at the site of Paddington Brothers Construction, where Montag plans on leaving upper deckers in every master bathroom on the block. Caleb refuses to go along with the scheme and leaves with Cole. Cole confronts Caleb, who plans on ducking out of a date to join Montag and Swank with Operation: Sorbet, a scheme where they dig up their old elementary school’s time capsule and replace the capsule's contents with pornography. Caleb explains that he tries to keep a balance between his relationship with Cole and his friendship with Montag, but Cole explains that it’s not good enough and gives Caleb an ultimatum: either not follow through with Montag’s ongoing schemes or their relationship ends. Caleb backs out of Operation: Sorbet, and Montag is forced to hire the inexperienced Simon (Brett Jacobsen) to proceed with the prank. Scar foils Montag’s plans (while Tanner further humiliates Montag and Swank with water balloons) and beats him mercilessly. Operation: Sorbet ends in failure.  Caleb later meets up with Montag at his current residence (their childhood tree house) finding him defeated and demoralized by Operation: Sorbet’s failure. Caleb apologies for bailing out of him and proclaims his full involvement with Montag’s next upcoming scheme. Montag, Caleb and Swank plan on sabotaging Paddington’s annual reenactment of Washington Crossing of the Delaware as Native Americans. The trio attack Paddington’s crew with jousting cardboard tubes, while Montag swipes Paddington’s costume wig of George Washington, claiming it as his prize. Montag trips as he tries to escape, falling victim to Paddington’s impending attack with a replica saber. Caleb quickly disables Paddington with a throwing dart before he can attack Montag and falls in the icy Delaware.  The next day after their victory celebration, Caleb discovers that a bounty has been placed on him after a picture of him (in disguise) is shown disarming Paddington. Caleb is distraught, but Montag reassures him that his identity will remain safe. Meanwhile, Scar, who still harbors feelings for Cole, deliberately gets drunk at Sherrwood Tavern and calls her for a ride home. During the ride, Scar reveals to Cole photographic evidence of Caleb’s involvement in the Reenactment sabotage, where he will reveal them to the authorities unless Cole has sex with him. Cole and Scar engage in the act in her car, and Cole becomes in sole possession of the photos, proclaiming to Scar that she’s doing this because she loves Caleb. Montag runs into Cole while she tears up in her car, revealing that he knows about the affair.  Later at Sherrwood Tavern, Paddington, having recovered from his injuries, announces the tavern’s annual dart championship tournament, where the winner of the tournament gets a prize pack, including debt-free rights from the tavern. Paddington believes that the dart thrower who injured him will attend the tournament, and he will be able to catch him and arrest him for the assault during the Reenactment. Scar thanks Cole for the ride home from the tavern earlier and requests another ride. Through heavy implication, Scar reveals to Caleb of Cole having sex with him. Caleb is angry at Cole’s actions, but understands the reasons behind it.  Caleb later visits Montag, who is busy cleaning up his tree house after it burned down sometime earlier from an accidental electrical fire. Caleb asks Montag for advice on how to get back at Scar, Montag answers by beating him at the dart tournament. He goads Caleb into regaining his confidence in his dart throwing ability and Caleb enters the tournament in disguise. Caleb and Scar make it to the finals, where Caleb narrowly beats Scar and claims the title of champion. His throwing darts match the same one used by during the Reenactment, and Caleb is promptly arrested by Paddington. However, Montag exonerates Caleb with a signed confession of his involvement of the scheme and delivers Paddington the wig stolen from him, claiming that Paddington doesn’t have enough valid evidence to lock Caleb away. Enraged, Scar attacks Caleb with a pool cue, but Montag defends him with his own pool cue, claiming that Scar’s anger has always been towards him, not Caleb. Scar overpowers Montag, and before he delivers the final blow, Swank hits from behind with a pool cue of his own, giving him a second scar and knocking him unconscious.  Springtime, Montag visits Caleb at Sherrwood Tavern, where he reveals that he’s chosen self-exile from Bucks County over jail time thanks to an old county law. Montag plans on returning to Bucks County one day by running for county commissioner, despite his lack of political experience. He says his goodbyes and Caleb takes over Montag’s role as serial prankster of Bucks County.

In the room, Tonya finds a tape recorder that explains the rules, one of the which state "Only those without collars can break the rules". One of the strangers cross a forbidden zone, and the electric collar that he wears kills him instantly. A box marked "Pieces" catches Tonya's interest, but none of the strangers tell her what is inside. Another stranger finds a piece of paper in his pocket; written on it is, "Hint: piece the pieces". Another rule is shown that players may not adjust their collars. As the game progresses, they become mad and frantically try to find a way out. The host explains that there can be only one winner, and the prize is that person's life.  The strangers get to know each other.

One of the strangers is kidnapped by an unknown entity; however, another person finds her dead in the toilet. The game progresses once again, and another person finds a paper in a closed drawer.

They open it and find the words, "hint: What is your favorite type of serial? In this game there are three. One rapist, one pedophile and one killer, find the killer, find the reason." The people ask each other more questions, and the host tells them they have a minute before someone is eliminated. One of them commits suicide by shooting himself in the mouth. Tonya pieces together a key. Amid further eliminations, the others learn that these killings are called "curfews". Tonya discovers that the key could unlock one of the collars.

Tanner later finds a black box containing bullets with another paper with the words "Hint: Bite the bullet".  
Bottle Shock
 [[Sommelier]] and wine shop owner [[Steven Spurrier (wine)|Steven Spurrier]] ([[Alan Rickman]]), a British expatriate living in [[Paris]], is concerned with how to save his business in his daily conversation with Maurice ([[Dennis Farina]]), a wine lover from [[Milwaukee]] who is Spurrier's regular (sometimes only) customer. He concocts a plan to hold a blind taste-test intended to introduce Parisians to the quality wines coming from elsewhere in the world.  Spurrier travels to the not-yet-famous [[Napa Valley AVA|Napa Valley]] in search of contestants for his [[Judgment of Paris (wine)|Judgment of Paris]] taste test, where a chance meeting introduces him to foundering [[vintner]] [[Jim Barrett (winemaker)|Jim Barrett]] ([[Bill Pullman]]) of [[Chateau Montelena]]. Barrett wants no part in the competition, believing it to be a set-up designed by the French to humiliate New World wine producers. Barrett's son, [[Bo Barrett|Bo]] ([[Chris Pine]]), secretly passes Spurrier a couple of bottles of the Chateau's [[chardonnay]] for the competition.  Due to reductionist techniques in wine making (the absence/reduction of oxygen during the wine making process), the chardonnay has turned brown in the bottles, causing Barrett Sr. to call for the whole vintage to be carted away for dumping. But Bo discovers the brown color is only temporary and manages to recover the vintage, thanks to the help of local bar owner Joe ([[Eliza Dushku]]) who had intercepted the bottles on the way to the dump.  Bo is asked to travel to Paris to represent the Napa Valley vintners at the contest. After tallying the scores from the eight Parisian judges, Spurrier is shocked to find that [[Chateau Montelena|Montelena]] has won the Chardonnay competition.  The report is featured in an article of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''; restaurants and wine shops all around America are asked continuously for the wine ([[Chateau Montelena]] Chardonnay 1973) and forced to admit that they do not have it. This twist of fate and the resultant oenological epiphany forever changes the fortunes of Napa Valley wineries and the global wine industry as a whole, as it is revealed that French wines are in fact not unbeatable.  In the end, the futures of the characters are revealed: Jim Barrett continues to make wine into his 80s, although Bo now runs the winery. A bottle of [[Chateau Montelena|Montelena]] Chardonnay 1973 and the red wine, [[Stag's Leap Wine Cellars|Stags Leap]] [[cabernet sauvignon]] 1973, also from California, that had won the same competition were given a display case at the [[Smithsonian]] Institution. In 2006, thirty years after the first competition, Steven Spurrier hosted another contest, this time with full confidence that French wine would win. California won again.<ref name="sundance" />

The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (film)
 The film opens with the quote, "Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights, before the dark hour of reason grows," by [[John Betjeman]]. A young boy named Bruno lives with his family in [[Berlin]], in [[Nazi Germany]] during the period of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. He learns that his father Ralf has been promoted, due to which their family, including Bruno's mother Elsa and sister Gretel, relocate to the countryside. Bruno hates his new home as there is no one to play with and very little to explore. After commenting that he has spotted people working on what he thinks is a farm in the distance (but, unbeknownst to the innocent Bruno, is actually a concentration camp), he is also forbidden from playing in the back garden.  Bruno and Gretel get a private tutor, Herr Liszt, who pushes an agenda of [[antisemitism]] and nationalist propaganda. As a result, Gretel becomes extremely fanatical in her support for the Third Reich, to the point of covering her bedroom wall with [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]] posters and portraits of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Bruno is confused as the [[Jews]] he has seen, in particular the family's Jewish servant Pavel, do not resemble the caricatures in Liszt's teachings.  One day, Bruno disobeys his parents and sneaks off into the woods, eventually arriving at an electric barbed wire fence surrounding a camp. He befriends a boy his own age named Shmuel. The pair's lack of knowledge on the true nature of the camp is revealed: Bruno thinks that the striped uniforms that Shmuel, Pavel, and the other prisoners wear are pyjamas and Shmuel believes his grandparents died from an illness during their journey to the camp. Bruno starts meeting Shmuel regularly, sneaking him food and playing board games with him. He eventually learns that Shmuel is a Jew and was brought to the camp with his father and mother.  [[File:Sachsenhausen clothes.jpg|thumb|left|Prisoner's clothing from [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]]] One day, Elsa discovers the reality of Ralf's assignment after [[Lieutenant]] Kurt Kotler lets slip that the black smoke coming from the camp's chimneys is due to the burning corpses of Jews. She confronts Ralf, disgusted and heartbroken. At dinner that night, Kotler admits that his father had left his family and moved to [[Switzerland]]. Upon hearing this, Ralf tells Kotler that he should have informed the authorities of his father's disagreement with the current political regime as it was his duty. The embarrassed Kotler then becomes infuriated with Pavel for accidentally spilling a glass of wine and violently beats him. The next morning the maid, Maria, is seen scrubbing the blood stains.  Later that day, Bruno sees Shmuel working in his home. Shmuel is there to clean wine glasses because they needed someone with small hands to do it. Bruno offers him some cake and willingly Shmuel accepts it. Unfortunately, Kotler happens to walk into the room where Bruno and Shmuel are socialising. Kotler is furious and yells at Shmuel for talking to Bruno. In the midst of his scolding, Kotler notices Shmuel chewing the food Bruno gave him. When Kotler asks Shmuel where he got the food, he says Bruno offered the cake, but Bruno, fearful of Kotler, denies this. Believing Bruno, Kotler tells Shmuel that they will have a "little chat" later. Distraught, Bruno goes to apologise to Shmuel, but finds him gone. Every day, Bruno returns to the same spot by the camp but does not see Shmuel. Eventually, Shmuel reappears behind the fence, sporting a black eye. Bruno apologises and Shmuel forgives him, renewing the friendship.  After the funeral of his grandmother who was killed in Berlin by an enemy bombing, Ralf tells Bruno and Gretel that Elsa, their mother, suggests that they go to live with a relative because it is not safe there. In truth, Elsa suggests this because she does not want her children living with their murderous father. Shmuel has problems of his own; his father has gone missing after those with whom he participated in a march did not return to the camp. Bruno decides to redeem himself by helping Shmuel find his father. The next day, Bruno, who is due to leave that afternoon, dons a striped prisoners' outfit and a cap to cover his unshaven head, and digs under the fence to join Shmuel in the search. Bruno soon discovers the true nature of the camp after seeing the many sick and weak-looking Jews, much to his shock. While searching, the boys are taken on a march with other inmates by [[Sonderkommando]]s.  At the house, Gretel and Elsa discover Bruno's disappearance. After they discover the open window he went through, Elsa bursts into Ralf's meeting to alert him that Bruno is missing. Ralf and his men mount a search. Led by a dog tracking Bruno's scent they find his discarded clothing outside the fence. Elsa and Gretel are following along behind. They enter the camp, looking for him; Bruno, Shmuel and the other inmates are stopped inside a changing room and are told to remove their clothes for a "shower". They are packed into a [[gas chamber]], where Bruno and Shmuel hold each other's hands. A [[Schutzstaffel]] soldier pours some [[Zyklon B]] pellets inside, and the prisoners start panicking, yelling and banging on the metal door. When Ralf realises that a gassing is taking place, he cries out his son's name, and Elsa and Gretel fall to their knees in despair and mourn Bruno. The film ends by showing the closed door of the now-silent gas chamber, indicating that all prisoners, including Bruno and Shmuel, are dead.

Rex first implies he will never let Julia go, and accuses Charles of just wanting the estate. However, he then relents and agrees to release her in exchange for two of Charles's paintings, which are now viewed as a good investment. He also reveals that he converted to Catholicism to get Julia, and he disdains Charles for not having been willing to do the same. Julia overhears all of this, is shocked and angered, feeling like bartered goods. Their arrangements made, Charles and Julia prepare to leave Brideshead.   Just as they are driving out, however, they pass a small caravan of cars that are arriving: Lord Marchmain is terminally ill, and has returned with Cara so he can spend his final days in his home.

The Broken (film)
 The audience is introduced to Gina ([[Lena Headey]]), a successful radiologist, who is examining x-rays of a patient with [[Situs inversus|Situs Inversus]], an uncommon condition in which a person is born with their heart and other organs reversed or mirrored from their normal positions. On the birthday of her father, John ([[Richard Jenkins]]), Gina, along with her boyfriend Stefan ([[Melvil Poupaud]]), her brother Daniel ([[Asier Newman]]) and his girlfriend Kate ([[Michelle Duncan]]) surprise John in his home. In the middle of the dinner party, a mirror previously knocked askew when John entered the room falls and shatters. Kate and Gina proceed to clean the shards and discuss that breaking mirrors is a sign of bad luck. At work the next day, Gina is baffled by her assistant Anthony ([[Damian O'Hare]]) when he tells her that he just saw her walking out of the building. Gina explains that she has been inside the whole time. On her way home however, she sees a woman who looks exactly like her driving a car identical to hers, so Gina follows the woman to her flat and sees a picture of her and her dad inside the woman's room. A frightened Gina runs out of the building and drives her car seemingly disturbed at what she saw, and ends up colliding head on with another car in the middle of the road. Gina awakens in a hospital with no memory of the accident. She is introduced to a therapist Dr. Robert Zachman ([[Ulrich Thomsen]]) who leaves his business card. Gina is released and Stefan takes her home.  Back at Stefan's flat, Gina notices his mirror is missing and he explains he broke it by accident. Stephan goes to take the dog out and it snaps at him, which is peculiar. Gina runs a bath and while relaxing in the tub, she notices a leak in the ceiling and goes to check on it in the attic but is stopped by Stefan who appears to be cold and less emotional than earlier appearances in the film.  Gina sleeps fitfully that evening and has flashbacks of her father's birthday party, the accident as well as  unearthly scenes and a frightening sexual encounter with a seemingly Stefan.  Frightened by all of this,  Gina contacts Dr. Zachman about her concerns that the man known as Stefan is not really her boyfriend at all. Dr. Zachman suggests this may be a form of [[Prosopagnosia]], or face blindness, brought on by brain damage and/or memory loss sustained in the car crash. He advises more tests to be performed and recommends Gina visit her wrecked car in hopes that it will help her remember the events surrounding the accident.  Meanwhile, Daniel and Kate arrive home to see their neighbor in the stairwell. The neighbor is clearly disturbed and appears to be about to say something, however, his wife watches him expressionlessly through a crack in the door. The neighbor does not finish what he has to say, and nervously goes into the apartment with his wife.   Gina goes to the auto shop to examine her car, and finds the picture she found of her and John from the woman's flat. While investigating her car, Gina hears the sound of breaking glass and turns to see two identical dogs fighting each other next to a broken mirror.   She visits John in his office at the American Embassy and shows him the picture. He began worrying about what has gotten into his daughter's mind. Later, John's secretary mentions seeing him on the street during lunch, but he tells her he hadn't left the office all day. He later goes into the Embassy's men's room where he finds the mirror broken on the floor.  Meanwhile, at their home, Kate arrives only to find out that Daniel is not there. As Kate peers into the hallway mirror, a being in what appears to be a dark, shadowy version of her looks back at her. Unaware of her observer, Kate takes a shower, but is disturbed by the sound of a mirror breaking. Suddenly, a woman who looks exactly like her enters the bathroom and murders Kate.  Back to Gina who is at the subway station, picture in hand, when someone bumps into her, making her drop the photo which flies onto the subway rail. Gina gets on the ground to reach down for it when she hears a train coming just around the bend. She finally stretches far enough and narrowly escapes being hit by the train, but successfully grabs the picture.   Gina visits her father at home where he tells her the doctor called him and voiced his concerns regarding Gina's opinion that Stefan has changed. She then relays the events that unfolded that day and shows John the picture, to which he replies, "Maybe it's not me."  Gina phones Stefan to check on him but he does not answer. She goes back to Stefan's flat to find it deserted. Gina hears the water leaking once more and goes to the attic to investigate where she finds Stefan, dead, with his head smashed onto a pipe. Panicking, Gina calls John for help but when a man who looks like John appears out of the shadows from behind him, they are disconnected.  Scared, Gina runs into the bathroom and locks the door. Someone jiggles the door knob from outside and pounds on the door trying to break it open, but Gina gets out through the bathroom window.  Suddenly, the door breaks open and a man looking exactly like Stefan walks into the room. We then see Gina running down the street and into a phone booth where she relives parts of her day and picks up the phone receiver and calls her brother, Daniel.   Gina explains everything to Daniel about the woman she saw who looks like her and that she followed the woman to her flat. Daniel realizes that Gina is talking about her own home and tells Gina that's where she lives. Gina ends the call.  Daniel hangs the phone up, turns and sees broken mirror pieces on the floor. Puzzled, he walks further into the apartment when he begins to hear scrubbing noises and follows the sound to the bathroom where he sees Kate scrubbing the blood stained floor. Daniel calls to Kate who stands up and they look at each other with no emotion.  Gina arrives at her flat and is let in the building by the night watchman. Gina gets a spare key to her apartment from him and he asks if he should make her another key to which she replies no, she has another set somewhere.   Gina continues to her flat, and quietly walks in, not sure what she might find, when she goes into the bathroom where she finds a dead body of herself with a plastic bag over her head. Gina pulls the bag off her head, which causes the previously suppressed memories she had been struggling to remember to come flooding back to her. Gina backs up, crying, looks up and suddenly remembers coming home, seeing something that frightens her. She drops a wallet, glass breaks and she sees herself putting the plastic bag over her head and dragging herself murdering the real Gina.  More memories flit by as Gina processes everything, then she goes to the living room window which she looks out and down at her father, John, who is standing on the sidewalk looking up at her.   The film concludes as Mirror Gina is examining x-rays of herself showing that she too now has Situs Inversus, implying that the patient from the beginning of the film along with others are also being replaced by [[Doppelgänger|doppelgangers]] from the other side of the mirror. Daniel comes to see Gina at the hospital, but realizes that she has been replaced similar to how Gina earlier realized that Stefan was not Stefan anymore. Daniel runs away as Mirror Gina stares at him and smiles. Mirror Gina is then seen driving her car while smiling eerily to destinations unknown.  
Brothel (film)
  A young couple buy an old house in [[Jerome, Arizona|Jerome]] which used to be a [[brothel]]. The husband commits suicide and the wife, Julianne (played by [[Serena Scott Thomas]]), attempts to come to terms with her loss and modernise the house. She 'finds the building is still inhabited by the ghosts of prostitutes' and 'that she is being stalked by [[Death (personification)|Death]] himself ([[Bruce Payne]])'.<ref></ref>  
Bronson (film)
 The film begins with short scenes from Bronson's delinquent childhood and early life, narrated with a wry humor by Hardy as Bronson/Peterson.  Initially he is shown confronting the camera directly, dressed in prison garb; other times he is shown telling his tale in a vaudeville-style theater in front of a live audience who laugh at and applaud his stories.  The film's story is not told in a purely linear fashion but unfolds as a surreal narrative of connected vignettes, punctuated by vaudeville interludes which sometimes break into the film at unexpected times.  He recounts various episodes of criminal behavior and violence which lead to his being sentenced to seven years in prison. At his sentencing, his mother optimistically declares her hope that he'll get out in four years.  While in prison, however, he engages in numerous violent outbursts, assaulting prison guards and fellow prisoners alike, which results in his sentence being extended beyond seven years.  Eventually Peterson is sent to a psychiatric hospital where he continues to rebel against those charged with the duty of controlling him. In response, Peterson is kept heavily drugged which makes him physically weak. His first escape attempt is merely to walk sluggishly toward the exit until he is calmly thwarted by a staffer standing nearby who waves him into a chair. Later, he decides to escape by earning himself a transfer back to prison. He attempts to strangle another detainee with his socks, but is apprehended before killing the man, which means he will not be transferred. He comments to the audience that despite all his prison time and solitary confinement, he has never yet killed anyone.  In the vaudeville theater, Peterson/Bronson shows film footage of a rooftop protest during which he escaped to the institution's roof and managed to cause what he calls "tens of millions of pounds' damage". He credits this destruction with the government's subsequent decision to declare him "sane" and have him released.  After a brief reunion with his parents, who have moved to a small suburban home, he sets off to see his Uncle Jack in Luton, where he was raised.  He is welcomed back and reintroduced to an old prison mate, who promises to set him up with a new career as a bare-knuckle boxer and gives him the new name "Charles Bronson", after [[Charles Bronson|the famous American actor]].  Bronson enters the world of bare knuckle boxing and seems to enjoy both the violence and showmanship involved. Not content with his meagre winnings, he ups the stakes by fighting two opponents at once, and even fights a dog.  Banged up and in love, Bronson proposes to a woman he met at his uncle’s, but she tells him she loves another man, "her boyfriend".  Bronson steals a thousand-pound ring in the hopes that she will marry him. She declines, stating she plans to marry her boyfriend. Bronson is shortly thereafter apprehended and brought back to jail.  Thus after sixty-nine days of freedom he once again finds himself imprisoned.  He kidnaps the prison librarian and calmly waits for reinforcements to arrive, alternatively screaming at his hostage and peaceably asking him about his family. When he hears the other guards arriving, he strips naked and forces the librarian to assist in applying his "body armor", which is actually petroleum jelly meant to make him harder to grab a hold of in the imminent brawl.  After being restrained again, he is warned by the prison governor that he will die inside if his behavior does not improve.  The next few scenes show Bronson's embrace of drawing and cartooning.  Encouraged by a prison art teacher who notices something special in his drawings, he seems to become a model prisoner for a while, channeling his confusion and pain into vivid imagery of birds and grotesque creatures.  He is allowed access to a prison art studio where advanced art supplies are available for use. When told the art studio will be closing, the art teacher attempts to comfort Bronson that his artistic talents may help him secure early release. Bronson's response is to attack the teacher, holding him hostage in the studio as prison officials wait outside.  While this standoff takes place, he demands music be played, and he paints his naked body black as he listens, and ties the teacher to a post. He forces an apple into his mouth, paints a matching mustache onto his face, and removes his own hat and glasses to put on the teacher's head.  After this human still-life has been arranged to his satisfaction, he accepts his fate, calling for the prison guards to burst in for yet another violent brawl which will send him back to solitary.

The Brothers Bloom
 The Brothers Bloom, orphaned at a young age, begin performing [[confidence tricks]] as young children; Stephen dreams up elaborate scenarios and his younger brother, Bloom, creates trust with the marks. Stephen creates his first con as a way of encouraging his brother to talk to girls.  Twenty-five years later, the brothers are the world's most successful con men. They even have a regular accomplice: Bang Bang, a Japanese explosives expert who rarely speaks. Bloom, however, is dissatisfied with being nothing but an actor in Stephen's schemes. He quits and moves to [[Montenegro]]. Three months later, Stephen finds Bloom and convinces him to execute one final con. The brothers will masquerade as antiques dealers and target Penelope Stamp, a rich, socially-isolated heiress who lives alone in a [[New Jersey]] mansion.   Bloom and Penelope meet when Bloom purposely runs into Penelope's sports car with his bike. Penelope reveals that she has been alone for most of her life and has picked up an array of strange hobbies such as [[juggling]] and [[kung fu]]. Bloom senses Penelope's craving for adventure and hints that he is sailing to Europe tomorrow. The next morning, Penelope arrives at the harbor to sail with the brothers to Greece.  On the boat, Melville, a Belgian hired by Stephen, begins the con, telling Penelope that the brothers Bloom are in fact antiques [[smugglers]] and he wants their help with a smuggling job in [[Prague]]. Penelope is thrilled with the idea of becoming a smuggler and convinces the brothers to accept the job, unaware that this is part of the con. Meanwhile, Bloom and Penelope are becoming attracted to one another, but Stephen warns Bloom that the con will fail if he actually falls in love with Penelope.  At the hotel bar in Prague, Bloom is visited by the brothers' former mentor and current enemy, Diamond Dog. He warns Bloom that Stephen will not be around forever, and tells Bloom he should join him. Stephen arrives and stabs Diamond Dog in the hand with a broken bottle, telling him to stay away.  In Prague, Melville cons Penelope out of a million dollars and flees, according to plan. Penelope still wants to go ahead as an antiques smuggler and steal the rare book that Melville told her about. The brothers tell Bang Bang to set off a small explosive in [[Prague Castle]] that will trigger the fire alarm, allowing Penelope to sneak in and steal the book. Instead, Bang Bang accidentally blows up the entire tower, creating panic in Prague. Despite this, Penelope enters the museum and steals the book. She is caught, but somehow convinces the chief of police to let her go.  The team goes to [[Mexico]] to complete the con. Bloom, who has fallen in love with Penelope, reveals to her that they are con men and the whole adventure has been a con. Stephen has anticipated his brother's change of heart and written it into his plan. The brothers fight and a gun accidentally discharges, wounding Stephen. Penelope checks out the wound, realizes that it is fake blood, and leaves with a broken heart. Bloom punches Stephen and leaves for Montenegro.   Three months later, Penelope finds Bloom, wanting to be with him and to become a con artist. Unable to deny his love for her but not wanting her to be like him, Bloom meets with Stephen to set up one final con, where they will fake their own deaths. The team goes to St. Petersburg, where they must sell the rare book to Diamond Dog.  They are ambushed by Diamond Dog's gang while heading to the exchange. Stephen is kidnapped and held for $1.75 million. Bloom suspects this is just another one of Stephen's tricks; Penelope, just in case, wires the money from her bank account to the mobsters. Bang Bang takes this opportunity to quit working for the Brothers Bloom; as soon as she leaves, her car explodes, leaving Penelope and Bloom uncertain whether she was caught in the blast or faked her death.  Bloom goes into an abandoned theater to make the exchange, and finds Stephen tied up and beaten. Bloom demands that Stephen tell him if this is real or if it is a con. A hit man tosses Bloom a phone, and Diamond Dog confirms that it is real. The hit man attacks them, and Stephen takes a bullet for Bloom and collapses on the floor. Bloom again asks whether this was real, or just the "perfect con." Stephen gets up and assures Bloom that he is fine. Stephen tells Bloom to leave St. Petersburg with Penelope, and that they will meet again.  Bloom and Penelope drive away. After several hours, Bloom discovers that Stephen's bloodstain on his shirt has changed in color from red to brown, indicating that it is not fake blood. Realizing that Stephen has surely died, Bloom breaks down on the side of the road while Penelope tries to comfort him. As they are leaving, Bloom recalls what Stephen had said earlier, "The perfect con is one where everyone involved gets just the thing they wanted"—and that perhaps his brother really pulled off the perfect con.

Burn After Reading
 Faced with a demotion at work due to a drinking problem, Osbourne Cox angrily quits his job as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[Intelligence analysis|analyst]] and decides to write a memoir. When his [[pediatrician]] wife Katie finds out, she sees it as an opportunity to file for divorce and continue her affair with Harry Pfarrer, a deputy [[U.S. Marshal]]. She copies her husband's financial records and other files, including the draft memoir, and gives them to her lawyer.  The lawyer's assistant copies the files onto a [[Compact disc|CD]], which she accidentally leaves on the locker room floor of Hardbodies, a local gym. The disc falls into the hands of dim-witted personal trainer Chad Feldheimer and his co-worker Linda Litzke, who mistakenly believe it to contain sensitive government information. They plan to return the disc for a reward, with Linda hoping to use the money to pay for [[cosmetic surgery]]. After a phone call and subsequent meeting with Osbourne provoke a furious reaction, Chad and Linda attempt to sell the disc to the [[Embassy of Russia in Washington|Russian embassy]]. Unbeknownst to them, the Russian ambassador is a spy for the CIA.  Osbourne's increasingly temperamental and erratic behavior prompts Katie to change the locks on their house and invite Harry to move in. Harry is a womanizer and is also seeing Linda. Linda persuades Chad to sneak into the Coxes' home to get more files from their computer. Harry finds Chad hiding in a wardrobe and the shock causes him to shoot Chad dead.  Two days later at the CIA headquarters, Palmer Smith, Osbourne's former superior, and his director learn that information from Osbourne has been given to the Russian Embassy. They are perplexed: the material delivered to the Russians is of no importance, and the apparent motive of all the involved parties is unknown. The director, unaware of Chad's identity, orders Chad's death to be covered up.  Harry argues with Katie and leaves the house. On his way out, he spots a man who has been trailing him for the past several days. Harry tackles the man and finds out that he is a private detective hired by his wife Sandy to gather evidence to divorce him. Separately, it is revealed that Sandy is having an affair of her own. Harry is devastated and goes to see an agitated Linda, who confides to Harry that Chad is missing. Harry agrees to help find Chad.  Linda returns to the Russian embassy to find Chad. The Russians have dismissed the CD contents as "drivel" and escort Linda off the embassy grounds. She turns to Ted Treffon, the kindhearted manager of Hardbodies, who has unrequited feelings for her. Against his better judgement, Ted agrees to go to the Coxes' home to search Osbourne's computer.  Harry and Linda meet in a park; Harry believes a man in the park is surveilling him. Linda denies knowing the man, which makes Harry suspicious. When Linda reveals the address where Chad disappeared, Harry realizes that Chad is the man he shot. Convinced that Linda is a spy and that everyone in the park is surveilling him, he panics and flees.  Osbourne becomes unhinged when he finds out that Katie has emptied his bank accounts and decides to break into the house to get his alcohol and personal belongings. Finding Ted in the basement, Osbourne shoots Ted and then kills him with a hatchet. A CIA agent intervenes by shooting Osbourne, leaving him in a [[coma]].  At CIA headquarters a few days later, Palmer and his director try to understand what happened. Harry has been detained trying to flee to Venezuela, as that country has no extradition treaty with the US. The director instructs Palmer to send Harry to Venezuela. The director and Palmer agree to leave Osbourne comatose and deal with him if he ever wakes. Linda promises to keep quiet if they will pay for her plastic surgery, to which the director agrees. They conclude that there appears to be no lesson for the agency to learn from the events. "I guess we learned not to do it again," the director says, despite not knowing exactly what they did, and closes the file.  
The Burrowers
 The year is 1879, and beyond the fringes of civilization a handful of pioneers maintain settlements while exploring the unknown territories. One night, under the shimmering Western stars, a family from one of these settlements is brutally dragged into darkness by a group of unknown invaders. At first the kidnappers are thought to be hostile [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s, and a posse forms to bring the family back home safely. Venturing out into the unmapped territories is an Irish immigrant desperate to find his lost love, a naïve teen eager to prove his worth, a former slave seeking his fortune, and a hardened pair of battle-weary Indian fighters. But nature's wrath and the [[tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]]s of hostile tribes are not the only threats that this group will be forced to confront, because as the bodies begin to multiply and the truth about the abductors gradually emerges, these rescuers will find out that there are forces in this world that cannot be described in human terms—and that seem to have motivations beyond our comprehension.  A species, called "Burrowers" by the Natives, used to subsist on [[American Bison|buffalo]]. When white settlers depleted the buffalo, the species began to survive on human meat - first hunting nearby Indians and later the settlers. One tribe in particular, the [[Ute people|Ute]], have experience in combating the hunter-species. The "Burrowers" first lace their victims by cutting them and drugging them with a toxin. The victim is then buried alive and eaten only after decomposition has begun. By the time the film's protagonists meet up with the Ute their numbers are severely depleted, but the Ute method of drugging someone already infected with "Burrower" toxin proves effective. When the "Burrowers" go to eat the twice drugged victim they themselves fall asleep and are vulnerable, especially to the rays of the sun, which are the only apparent thing that can kill them. However, the surviving member of the posse, the Irishman Coffey, is unable to discover exactly what the Ute used to drug the "Burrowers", as most of the remaining Ute are executed by the overzealous Cavalry. The film ends with the suggestion that the "Burrower" attacks will continue. In addition to the environmental message about changing ecosystems, the film assesses prevailing attitudes towards Blacks and Natives amongst the settlers in the West, with special focus on the brutality of the US cavalry.  
The Burning Plain
 Typical of Arriaga's works, this film is told in a nonlinear narrative, where events are revealed out of sequence. The following plot summary is in chronological order, thus does not reflect the exact sequence of the events as seen on screen.  The story starts some time during the mid-1990s in a small town near Las Cruces, New Mexico (close to the border with Mexico), where Gina ([[Kim Basinger]]), a wife and mother to four children, is introduced. Gina is having an affair with a local man named Nick Martinez ([[Joaquim de Almeida]]), who also has a family of his own, but unbeknownst to the two, Gina's teenaged daughter Mariana ([[Jennifer Lawrence]]) finds out about their love affair. Mariana follows her mother to Nick's trailer. Knowing the two are inside, and in an effort to make them end their affair, she disconnects the gas pipe leading into the trailer and sets it on fire. The flames eventually reach a gas tank, which explodes, consuming the entire trailer and claiming Nick and Gina's lives, although Mariana had no intention of killing either of them. After their funeral, Mariana and Nick's teenaged son, Santiago ([[JD Pardo]]), slowly begin to develop a relationship of their own. Mariana soon becomes aware that she is pregnant with Santiago's daughter. The two flee to Mexico amid disapproval from their families and decide to have the baby there; after she gives birth to their daughter, Mariana abandons her family and changes her name to Sylvia.  More than a decade later, Sylvia (now played by [[Charlize Theron]]) is working at a high-end restaurant in Oregon. Despite her success, she resorts to [[promiscuity]] and has persistent thoughts of suicide. Here, a mysterious man follows her around. It is Carlos (Jose Maria Yazpik), a close friend and business-partner of Santiago. After an accident involving their crop-dusting plane, the hospitalized Santiago urges Carlos to look for Sylvia, for whom Santiago has been searching since she abandoned him and their two-day-old daughter.  Because Carlos does not speak English and Sylvia does not speak Spanish, he has trouble explaining to her the purpose of his visit. Instead, he surprises Sylvia with her now 12-year-old daughter, Maria (Tessa Ia). Maria, who was already reluctant to meet her estranged mother, is heartbroken when Sylvia hastily departs without speaking to either when she sees Maria and Carlos waiting for her outside her home. After realizing her mistake, Sylvia enlists the help of her friend Laura ([[Robin Tunney]]) to find Carlos and Maria.  After reuniting, Sylvia, Maria, and Carlos go to Mexico, where Sylvia apologizes to Maria for the years she has been absent from her life. They visit Santiago, who is sedated due to the extent of his injuries. Sylvia confesses her past sins by his bedside, unsure if he will ever wake up again. The doctor reassures them that he will be fine, and the story concludes on a hopeful note.

AUTO activates the supply unit SUPPLY-R and dispatches the welding robot BURN-E to repair the damage. BURN-E [[Lockout-tagout|shuts off]] the power supply to the broken light and gets a new one from SUPPLY-R, but while he is preparing to weld it in place, EVE's ship docks with the ''Axiom''; distracted by the arrival and WALL-E's wave, BURN-E lets the new light float off into space.  SUPPLY-R reluctantly gives BURN-E another light, and BURN-E begins to install it as WALL-E is launched away from the ship in an [[escape pod]] set to self-destruct. The explosion of the pod startles BURN-E into slicing through the base of the light with his [[blowtorch]], destroying it. Annoyed by this second failure, SUPPLY-R drops his last spare light on the floor in front of BURN-E, who successfully installs it. As he finishes, WALL-E and EVE fly back into the ''Axiom'' after their dance in space and the hatch closes behind them, locking BURN-E out. Some time later, an [[airlock]] opens to jettison garbage and nearly ejects WALL-E and EVE as well; BURN-E hurries to the airlock, but it closes again before he can reach it. Still later, while playing with his blowtorch, BURN-E realizes that he can use it to cut through the hatch and re-enter the ''Axiom''.  Once inside, he prepares to restore power to the repaired light, but the fight between Captain McCrea and AUTO causes the ship to list and send BURN-E sliding out through the hole he cut. As he grabs hold of the light to avoid being thrown into space, McCrea shuts down AUTO and manually rights the ship for its [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] return to Earth, triggered by the plant WALL-E found. The speed of the journey pins BURN-E against the hull until the ''Axiom'' lands on Earth, after which he finds it deserted. Spotting SUPPLY-R through the window of an escape pod, he launches it and himself to slam into the ground. Throwing off the hatch, he turns on the light and begins to celebrate, only for the hatch to crush it. Frustrated, BURN-E collapses among the newly returned humans and robots.   In a [[post-credits scene]], SUPPLY-R consoles BURN-E by patting him on the head and saying "There, there" in a dull monotone.

 Advocate Jonas Bechmann is going through a crisis. It has been one year since his father died in a car crash. Although the police have not pursued the case, Jonas believes it was, in fact, murder, connected to the last case his father worked on. To investigate the murder, Jonas quits his job and applies for the post at the law firm his father left open when he died. He is denied the job but told by his father's old partner, Martin Schiller, that evidence has been found his father took a bribe to make evidence disappear that incriminated his last client, Claes Kiehlert. Furthermore, Martin implies that Jonas' father was killed because the evidence turned up in court after all.  Devastated Jonas indulges in a wild night on the town. He wakes the next morning in a hotel room, having only vague memories of having cheated on his fiancée, Camilla. When he enters the bathroom, he finds last night's girl dead on the floor, her throat heavily bruised. He hides the evidence of ever having been there and goes home to find an anonymous envelope waiting for him. It contains a DVD with incriminating footage of him making love to the girl and her being strangled to death. Furthermore, the message states a sum - 5,000,000 [[Danish Krone]] - a date and a place.  When Jonas goes to the place of delivery with the money (everything he owns), he hands over the payoff to the wrong person, an incidental passerby walking his [[Great Dane]], who takes off without a word. Next, two masked men arrive demanding that he deliver the same sum of money the next day at the same spot. To put further pressure on Jonas the tape will be delivered to Camilla. The police will be next, the blackmailers warn him.  Having nowhere left to turn to, Jonas retraces his steps of that fateful night, hoping he will find some clue to the identity of his blackmailers. During his search he sights the girl he has allegedly killed, being alive and healthy. She only just gets away from Jonas when two police men tackle him. Still, he manages to track her down. She tells him she is a call girl having been hired to set him up. She gives him the slip and jumps into a car blocking Jonas' in the road. Just before the car takes off an item of clothing belonging to his fiancée is thrown from its window.  Afraid for Camilla's life, Jonas rushes to the summer house where she is residing. There he finds her bound to a chair with a black sack over her head. Before he can free her, the two masked men arrive on the vicinity, threatening to kill Camilla if Jonas doesn't hand over the money. In the subsequent struggle he manages to shoot them both with their own weapons, but only after Camilla has been killed.<br>  However, taking the sack off the woman's head face reveals she is not Jonas' fiancée, but the call girl. The two men turn out to be the policemen who interfered in his chasing her. Martin Schiller arrives on the scene, having been called by a worried Camilla, who is safe at home. He offers Jonas to clean up the mess and urges him to go home.  Jonas does so, but, after a talk with Camilla, makes up his mind to turn himself in. The next day he goes to Martin's house to inform the man of his decision. Just as he is about to ring the bell, a Great Dane shows itself. It is the dog of the man who took off with Jonas' 5 million krone. He follows it to a shed in Martin's yard. In it he discovers not only the two so-called policemen and the call girl - the three of them very much alive - but also the walls to be covered with detailed planning for a large scam: the one he has been led through in the last past days. What's more, among the items in the room he notices his father's old cell phone.  Infuriated, Jonas grabs the phone and a gun and runs back to Martin's house, just in time to see the man drive off in his car. After a bumper to bumper race, in which he tries to push Martin off the road, Jonas faces him. At gunpoint Martin confesses to the murder on Jonas' father. When the concealed evidence turned up in court again, he feared retribution by Kiehlert accociates. Martin holds that he has done no more than Jonas has done in the past few days: concealing evidence of a crime and killing in order to protect himself. He then offers Jonas a dream position at his law firm. Grudgingly Jonas accepts.  In the last scene Jonas is seen signing his new contract in the presence of Martin and the director of the law firm. Jonas thanks Martin and plays a recording which he has taped on his father's phone. It is Martin's confession of the murder.

The story begins as Sarah says goodbye to her familiar world. After finishing an arduous course in caregiving, she bids farewell to the Grade 5 classroom where she teaches English. She buys a winter coat for her son Paulo ([[John Manalo]]) and promises he will use it once she can afford to take him to London.

While window-shopping at a famous mall, Sarah meets Sean ([[Makisig Morales]]), a spunky Filipino boy, as he tries to shoplift chocolate bars.  After the initial fleeting period of excitement, she experiences the hard challenges every Filipino caregiver faces every day: cold weather, dirty work and difficult patients.  Meanwhile, Teddy also struggles with the daily grind in the hospital where he works. He is stressed and drinks often because he has failed the nursing test twice.  Despite the difficulty of adjusting to London life, however, Sarah faithfully stands by her Teddy. She tries to make the most of the situation by doing her best at work and earns the respect of Mr. Morgan, a wealthy old man. Teddy is oblivious to her success, however, as he is absorbed in his own problems with work. Sarah finds solace in her friendship with Mr. Morgan and his son David, who seems to appreciate her more than Teddy does, and with Sean, who eases her longing for her own son.  Tension rises between Sarah and Teddy as the stress of London life takes its toll on their marriage. Because of mounting conflict both at work and home, Teddy decides to give up. He tells Sarah that they are going back to the Philippines.  Sarah finds it very hard to accept Teddy's decision. She knows that staying in London is the best thing for their family, because returning to the Philippines would only mean going back to the same problems they had before. Will Sarah choose to remain by Teddy's side to keep her family intact? Or will she find the strength to stay in London to continue seeking a better life for her son, even if it means losing her marriage?

A few days before he leaves for college in [[Tokyo]], Seiji takes Mayumi to a pretty area with a view of the whole town, where he gives Mayumi a button from his [[gakuran]] jacket, telling her that he wants her to have it. This makes Mayumi happy.  However, that happiness soon ends. One night, when Sachiko and Yukie go to Tokyo, Mayumi decides to sleep in Sachiko's room. Sachiko's ex-boyfriend breaks into the Sawada house, enters Sachiko's room and, thinking that it's Sachiko in bed, pours [[sulfuric acid]] on Mayumi's face. He then kills her mother, stabbing her in the mouth, before being shot in the head by Mr. Sawada. Mayumi is rushed to the hospital, and the doctors are able to save her, though since the acid penetrated most of her bone, any further surgery would put Mayumi's life in danger.  Mayumi's two best friends, Junko and Kaoru try to visit her the next day, but Mayumi doesn't want to see anyone. Mayumi receives a phone call from Seiji, who asks if he can come see her. Mayumi declines, not wanting him to see her face. They agree to write letters to each other after he leaves. Upon her return to school, other students spread rumors about her and call her a "mutant girl" since she covers her face with a surgical mask. One day, Mayumi notices a woman in a red coat standing outside her house, who disappears. Things become worse when her father commits suicide as a way of saving the family's debts with his life insurance. Due to the rumors surrounding Mayumi, Kaoru and Junko begin to distance themselves from Mayumi. In Tokyo, Seiji now has a girlfriend, and has stopped writing to Mayumi. Mayumi continuously sees the woman in the red coat, which frightens her.  The next day, a news report announces that two high school students were killed by a woman wielding a pair of scissors. The students are revealed to be Mayumi's friends, Kaoru and Junko. Mayumi goes to their funeral, where she meets Seiji, who is in town until the next day. Mayumi wants to spend time with him one last time so he promises to meet with her the next morning. The next day, Seiji tells Mayumi that the only reason he gave her the button from his jacket is because Junko asked him to, and that he's always seen her as a little sister. She assumes it is because of her face. Seiji denies this, but when she takes off her mask, revealing the disfigured left side of her face, Seiji hesitantly tells her that he's already seeing someone. On the walk back, he ignores Mayumi. The scene suddenly cuts to a blood-covered Mayumi frantically cleaning a pair of bloody scissors with water. A flashback shows the red coated woman running up behind Seiji and stabbing him to death. The flashback also shows the bloody corpses of Kaoru and Junko. It is revealed that the red coat woman is Mayumi, as some sort of [[alter ego]].  With Mayumi's friends' murders, Seiji missing, and Mayumi's odd behavior, Yukie begins to become suspicious of her. One day, Yukie searches Mayumi's room and discovers the bloody dress she had worn when she met up with Seiji. She tells Sachiko. Mayumi realizes that her secret has been uncovered. At dinner, Mayumi hides the scissors behind her, and unmasks herself before taking a drink of her orange juice. However, Sachiko has poisoned her drink. Mayumi coughs up blood and eventually dies. To cover her, Sachiko places a trench coat over her body. Yukie reluctantly helps her clean up the mess. The two sisters bury Mayumi out in the woods. However, Mayumi somehow returns from the grave, and kills Yukie. She then kills Sachiko next. Before falling, Mayumi asks her, "Am I... pretty...?"  As it begins to rain, Mayumi looks up at the sky.

The film tells of how he was adopted by an elderly white couple in 1958 and brought up in [[Slade Green]], an all-white area of [[London]]. Cass is forced to endure racist bullying on a daily basis from local children, who also ridicule his feminine-sounding name, "Carol", a name give to him by his Jamaican biological parents. Cass adopts his new nickname after the boxer [[Cassius Clay]]. His adoptive father starts taking him to see [[West Ham United]] on a regular basis, and he becomes involved in hooliganism aged 14 after helping the [[Inter City Firm]], the West Ham hooligan firm, fight [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] supporters in 1972.   Cass climbs the ranks of the ICF to become the leader in the early 1980s. Cass finds through violence the respect he never had and becomes addicted to the buzz of fighting. Cass leads the ICF to victories against large hooligan firms, such as Leeds in 1980, but becomes frustrated with the lack of publicity the ICF are receiving. So he creates cards with the infamous slogan, "Congratulations, you have just met the famous ICF", and gives a TV interview, increasing the firm's notoriety for humiliation, their speciality. However, the government under [[Margaret Thatcher]] begins to come down hard on hooliganism, and after an organised attack on a group of [[Newcastle United]] supporters, Cass is imprisoned for four years. Whilst in [[HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs|Wormwood Scrubs]], Cass begins writing his autobiography, in the hope he can generate some income upon the book being published; however his writings are confiscated by the prison upon his release.   Cass is delighted to receive a hero's welcome upon his return, and begins dating Elaine ([[Natalie Press]]). This, as well as Cass's rejection of his biological parents after their attempts to contact him, improves his relationship with his adoptive parents after they began to disapprove of his violent lifestyle. Despite having a good relationship with Elaine, Cass is still lured to the violence of hooliganism, and when one of his best friends, Prentice (Gavin Brocker), is attacked by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] supporters with knives, Cass seeks revenge. He is stabbed in the following fight, and Elaine is disgusted, fearing he is returning to his old ways, as she reveals she is pregnant with his child.   As time progresses to the early 1990s, the ecstasy era takes over, and hooliganism becomes less of an attraction for Cass, and for many other hooligan firms. By 1992, he has settled down in [[Penge]], South London, with his young son and Elaine, who is pregnant again. Cass gets a job as a bouncer outside nightclubs, working for Ray ([[Tamer Hassan]]), a long-time friend from his ICF days. However one evening, just after starting a shift at the nightclub, Cass is shot three times by the group of Arsenal supporters that he feuded with back in the 1980s.  Cass survives, but wakes up to hear the tragic news that his mother has died.   In the following weeks, Cass is haunted by his demons after the shooting; he sees visions of his attacker, he can't sleep and on one occasion, makes a violent outburst at his son. Cass's friend Ray has tracked down his attackers and offers Cass the opportunity to kill them. Cass is taken to a pub and holds a gun to his attacker's head at point-blank range, but decides not to pull the trigger. The film ends as Cass walks away from the pub and into the distance.   Pennant himself plays a cameo role in the movie as the character "Biggs", who is one of the bouncers.

The caller, who is angry, shouts down the phone. Uncomfortable the man tries to leave but is shot with a silenced pistol several times by Lardier. The man who died was the brother of Cash.  Cash is under surveillance by Lieutenant Julia Molina from Interpol. He is part of a gang who are running a [[confidence trick]] on a group of mercenaries – led by Letallec – who think they are buying impeccable [[printing plate]]s for counterfeiting Euros. On returning to her headquarters, she is informed by her boss, Barnes, that another senior agent, Finley, are both in the running for his job. She asks if she can follow Cash in order to get an arrest that would help her promotional chances. Molina also discovers that Maxime, a master-criminal, is back in town and that her rival has an investigative advantage.  Molina then observes Cash as he begins work on his next victim, Garance, a wealthy heiress. However the mercenaries – who have discovered that the plates are fake – catch up with Cash forcing him to flee through the streets. Molina eventually catches up with Cash in her surveillance vehicle and offers to hide him inside. She then uses this opportunity to force him to take her into his confidence.  Cash explains he is running a con on the wealthy father of this heiress. He asks Molina to accompany him to a charity auction the man is hosting at his home in the country. Following the event, in which Cash paid €18,000 to help protect a hippopotamus in Africa because he started to have feelings for the daughter, the rich father is revealed to be none other than Maxime who ran the charity auction as his own con on Cash and his gang. His "daughter", who turns out to be one of his gang, berates Cash for being such a sucker for love. Maxime also explains that the con was to see whether Cash was smart enough to join his own gang; but he failed. He is told that another man, named Vincent, will have his role. In revenge Cash loses at poker in order to palm off a few fake euro notes to the gloating Vincent, who is picked up later trying to use them at racecourse.  Cash then gets the call that he will join the gang. Maxime explains that they are to do a heist on the French Riviera. They are going to steal €30million worth of untraceable diamonds from a ruthless South African mine owner who is going to use the stones to pay his mercenary army that protects and controls his business interests. Maxime runs through an elaborate plan – to break into the hotel's vault – where each team members plays a pivotal role.  In a private moment, Maxime also reveals that he knows Molina's real identity but states she can join in and get her share if she helps.  But when Molina returns to [[Interpol]] she is greeted by LeBlanc and LeBrun, two charmless agents from Interpol's Internal Affairs division in Brussels, who are looking into the backgrounds of the candidates seeking promotion. They question Molina about her investigations and her methods. They also mention that they are looking into rumors that some of the money seized in raids had gone missing. Molina goes to the [[Pool (cue sports)|pool hall]] owned by Cash's mentor, François. Cash explains that Maxime now needs all of them for the job. Barnes and Finley pick up Lardier after a tip off. During questioning they start to get around to the killing at the bank a year before. Molina finds LeBlanc and LeBrun waiting in her flat after trashing it looking for evidence in their own investigations.  The gang has rigged the hotel with CCTV and ask Molina to monitor them. However the mercenaries that bought the fake counterfeiting plates turn up and grab Cash. Seizing the moment that this commotion brings, François goes to the South African mine owner's room with a gun to grab the diamonds. François explains that his gang is double-crossing Maxime while they go down to the hotel vault. The jewels were never placed in any safe, they are really in the South African's room. Molina says she will go with him. But just outside the door she takes François' gun. The Interpol agent then enters the room, [[pistol whip]]s a guard, and takes the jewel case for herself. After being tripped by a little boy, she eventually escapes in one of the gang's waiting boat but not before shooting one of them on the way.  The little boy walks up to Garance and cries "mummy" who is then joined by Cash. The con is then explained. Maxime was working with Cash to set up Molina because she ordered Lardier to kill Cash's brother. He died because she realised he was conning her out of the money she had accumulated from [[Skimming (fraud)|skimming]] confiscated loot taken in her Interpol raids. When she tripped, the gang switched the jewel case. Molina now realises she's been set up for the robbery and the mercenaries are intent on killing her. The entire gang, including Letallec and Vincent, gather on the hotel terrace and toast themselves and Cash's dead brother.

Reverend Gustav Briegleb publicizes Christine's plight and rails against the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) for its incompetence, corruption and the [[extrajudicial punishment]] meted out by its "Gun Squad" led by [[James E. Davis (police)|Chief James E. Davis]]. Several months after Walter's disappearance, the LAPD tells Christine that the boy has been found alive. Believing the positive publicity will negate recent criticism of the department, the LAPD organizes a public reunion. Although "Walter" claims he is Christine's son, she says he is not. Captain J. J. Jones, the head of the LAPD's Juvenile Division, insists the boy is Walter and pressures Christine into taking him home "on a trial basis".  After Christine confronts Jones with physical discrepancies between "Walter" and her son, Jones arranges for a medical doctor to visit her. He tells Christine that "Walter" is three inches shorter than before his disappearance because trauma has shrunk his spine, and that the man who took Walter had him [[Circumcision|circumcised]]. A newspaper prints a story that implies Christine is an unfit mother; Briegleb tells Christine it was planted by police to discredit her. Walter's teacher and dentist each give Christine signed letters confirming "Walter" is an impostor. Christine tells her story to the press; as a result, Jones sends her to [[Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center|Los Angeles County Hospital]]'s "[[Psychiatric ward|psychopathic ward]]". She befriends inmate Carol Dexter, who tells Christine she is one of several women who were sent there for challenging police authority. Dr. Steele (O'Hare) diagnoses Christine as delusional and forces her to take mood-regulating pills. Steele says he will release Christine if she admits she was mistaken about "Walter"; she refuses.  Detective Ybarra travels to a ranch in [[Mira Loma, California|Wineville]], [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], to arrange the deportation of 15-year-old Sanford Clark to [[Canada]]. The boy's uncle, Gordon Northcott, has fled after a chance encounter with Ybarra, who mentions his business there being a juvenile matter. Clark tells Ybarra that Northcott forced him to help kidnap and murder around twenty children, and identifies Walter as one of them. Jones tells Briegleb that Christine is in protective custody following a mental breakdown. Jones orders Clark's deportation, but Ybarra takes Clark to the murder site and tells him to dig where the bodies are buried. Clark hesitates, but soon uncovers body parts. Briegleb secures Christine's release by showing Steele a newspaper story about the Wineville killings that names Walter as a possible victim. Under interrogation by Ybarra, Walter's impostor reveals his motive was to secure transport to Los Angeles to see his favorite actor, [[Tom Mix]], and says the police told him to lie about being Christine's son. The police capture Northcott in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada. Meanwhile, Briegleb introduces Christine and her case to famed attorney "S.S." Hahn who takes the case ''pro bono'' and quickly secures a court order for the release of other unjustly imprisoned women whom the police wanted to silence.  On the day of the city council's hearing into the case, Christine, Hahn, and Briegleb arrive at Los Angeles City Hall, where they encounter thousands of protesters who are demanding answers from the city and decrying the LAPD. The hearing is intercut with scenes from Northcott's trial. The council concludes that Jones and Davis should be removed from duty, and that extrajudicial internments by police must be stopped. Northcott's jury finds him guilty of murder and the judge sentences him to death by hanging.  Two years later, Christine has still not given up her search for Walter. Northcott sends her a message saying he is willing to admit to killing Walter on condition that Christine meets him before his execution. She visits Northcott, but he refuses to tell her if he killed her son. Northcott is executed the next day.  In 1935, David Clay, one of the boys assumed to have been killed, is found alive in [[Hesperia, California]]. He reveals that one of the boys with whom he was imprisoned was Walter. David, Walter, and another boy escaped, but were separated. David does not know whether Walter was recaptured, but he says Walter helped him escape, giving Christine hope he is alive.  In the epilogue, it states that after the hearing, Captain Jones was suspended, Chief Davis was demoted, and Los Angeles Mayor [[George E. Cryer|George Cryer]] chose not to run for reelection. California's [[state legislature]] made it illegal to forcibly commit people to psychiatric facilities by mere words alone of authorities, and Rev. Briegleb continued to use his radio show to expose police misconduct and political corruption. Wineville is said to have changed its name to Mira Loma to escape the stigma of the murders, and Christine Collins reportedly never stopped searching for her son.

Che (2008 film)
   ===Part 1: The Argentine=== In [[Havana]] in 1964, Che Guevara is interviewed by [[Lisa Howard (reporter)|Lisa Howard]] who asks him if reform throughout Latin America might not blunt the "message of the Cuban Revolution."  In 1955, at a gathering in [[Mexico City]], Guevara first meets [[Fidel Castro]]. He listens to Castro’s plans and signs on as a member of the [[July 26th Movement]].  There is a return to 1964 for Guevara’s address before the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in New York City, where he makes an impassioned speech against [[American imperialism]], and defends the executions his regime has committed, declaring "this is a battle to the death."  March 1957. Guevara deals with debilitating bouts of asthma as his group of revolutionaries meet up with Castro’s. Together, they attack an army barracks in the [[Sierra Maestra]] on May 28, 1957. After that, they begin to win over the rural peasant population of Cuba and receive increasing support, while battling both the government and traitors in their midst. Gradually, however, the government loses control of most of the rural areas. Soon afterward, the July 26th Movement forges alliances with other revolutionary movements in Cuba, and begin to assault towns and villages. Most fall to the rebels with little to no resistance.  On October 15, 1958, the guerrillas approach the town of [[Las Villas (Cuba)|Las Villas]]. The [[Battle of Santa Clara]] is depicted with Guevara demonstrating his tactical skill as the guerrillas engage in street-to-street fighting and derail a train carrying Cuban soldiers and armaments. Near the film‘s end, they are victorious. With the Cuban Revolution now over, Guevara heads to Havana, remarking "we won the war, the revolution starts now."  ===Part 2: Guerrilla===  The second part begins on November 3, 1966 with Guevara arriving in Bolivia disguised as a middle-aged representative of the [[Organization of American States]] hailing from [[Uruguay]], who subsequently drives into the mountains to meet his men. The film is organized by the number of days that he was in the country. On Day 26, there is solidarity among Guevara's men despite his status as a foreigner. By Day 67, Guevara, however, has been set up for betrayal. He tries to recruit some peasants only to be mistaken for a [[cocaine]] smuggler, and the [[Communist Party of Bolivia|Bolivian Communist Party]], led by [[Mario Monje]], refuse to support the armed struggle. On Day 100, there is a shortage of food and Guevara exercises discipline to resolve conflicts between his Cuban and Bolivian followers.  By Day 113, some of the guerrillas have deserted, and, upon capture, have led the [[Bolivian Army]] to the revolutionaries' base camp, which contained vast stockpiles of food, much-needed supplies, and intelligence identifying much of the group as Cubans. Much to Che's disappointment [[Tamara Bunke|Tamara "Tania" Bunke]], Guevara's revolutionary contact has botched elaborate preparations and given away their identity. On Day 141, the guerrillas capture Bolivian soldiers that refuse to join the revolution and are free to return to their villages. [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and [[Special Forces (United States Army)|US Army Special Forces]] advisers arrive to supervise [[Counter-insurgency|anti-insurgent]] activity and to train the Bolivian Army. On Day 169, Guevara's visiting friend, the French intellectual [[Régis Debray]], is captured at Muyupampa by the Bolivian Army along with two of Che's last contacts with the outside world. A Bolivian airstrike then occurs against Che's guerrillas on Day 219, driving them deeper into hiding. By this time, Che has split his forces; his best fighters travel with him in one column, while another column contains other personnel, including Tania, and carries much of the remaining supplies.  Guevara grows sick and by Day 280 can barely breathe as a result of his acute asthma. Nevertheless, he continues to lead his group towards the other column of revolutionaries. On Day 302, the Bolivian Army wipes out the other column, killing Tania Bunke, Juan Acuña Ñunez, and several others in an ambush as they attempt to cross the Vado del Yeso after a local informant tells the Bolivian troops about the movements of the rebels. By Day 340, Guevara is trapped by the Bolivian Army in the Yuro Ravine near the village of [[La Higuera]]. Che is wounded and captured. The next day, a helicopter lands and [[Cuban Americans|Cuban American]] CIA agent [[Félix Rodríguez (soldier)|Félix Rodríguez]] emerges to interrogate Che, but without success. The Bolivian high command then phones and orders Guevara's execution. He is shot on 9 October 1967, and his corpse lashed to a helicopter's landing skids and flown out.  In a final flashback scene, Guevara is aboard the ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]'' in 1956, looking out over the ocean, as the Cuban Revolution is about to begin. He sees the Castro brothers alone at the bow of the ship; Fidel is talking and Raúl is taking notes. Guevara hands a peeled orange to one of his comrades and returns his gaze to the lone brothers before the scene fades to black.  
Chaos Theory (film)
 Frank Allen is a professional speaker who lectures on time management. He lives by example: perfectly maximizing his efficiency through scheduling and planning his own life down to the minute. He dearly loves his wife, Susan, and their young daughter, Jesse.   On the day of an important seminar that could be his major break on the corporate lecture circuit, Susan changes their clocks by 10 minutes, to give him time to run a meaningless errand for her on this important day, but she moves them the wrong way. From missing the ferry to the career-damaging fact that he then arrives late to his lecture on time management, Frank experiences an off day. He loves his wife so much that, when the beautiful Paula crashes his hotel room, strips down and jumps on him, Frank excuses himself and heads home in the middle of the night.   While driving home through the night he sees a pregnant woman, Nancy, having contractions and gives the stranger a lift. At the hospital, Frank is asked to fill out some paper work. Rattled by his off day, he mistakenly puts his own information down and the nurses at the hospital assume he is the father.  Before Frank arrives home, a nurse from the hospital calls attempting to reach “the father”. Susan instantly believes it is Frank's baby and that he is cheating on her and leading a double life. When Frank arrives home, she refuses to let him clear up the misunderstanding and throws him out of the house within moments. Her reaction through the next few days remains over the top, refusing to talk to Frank and only allowing him to see Jesse after school.  Left with no choice but to provide scientific proof to Susan, Frank sees a doctor for a paternity test, but receives the diagnosis that he was never able to reproduce to begin with, since he has [[Klinefelter's syndrome]]. The undeniable truth about Jesse and, thus, Susan’s own infidelity devastates Frank - but also explains why Susan so instantly presupposed that Frank was a cheater, treating him with unforgiving disdain and refusing to let him even try to clarify the situation.  A few days later, Nancy brings her baby to the Allens' house in hopes of thanking Frank for his kindness, finding only Susan at home. Nancy soon clears up the misunderstanding. Susan turns on a dime, ignoring her atrocious behaviour of the past few days and expecting Frank to simply come home, acting as if she is the one who has forgiven him.    But the damage is done, as Frank realizes that he was the one in the relationship who was faithful, and goes through a withdrawal as he tries to comprehend how his daughter could not be his and how wrong his life turned out when he believed that he has always stayed straight and narrow.  After giving a life-changing speech about living on whim at his own time management lecture, he decides to live his life based on chance from that moment on. He starts his reformed outlook on life with the simple idea of possibility and randomness by making his decisions based on shuffling three index cards with written options and choosing one at chance. Through his journey, he learns more about love, friendship, faith, hope and life than he ever imagined.  
The Chaser (film)
 Eom Joong-ho is a dishonest ex-detective turned [[pimp]] who is in financial trouble because two of his [[prostitution|girls]] have gone missing. One night he sends Mi-jin, one of his few remaining girls, to a customer. He then realizes that this is the same person who was the last to see his missing girls. Believing that this man is [[Human trafficking|reselling his women]], he goes to look for Mi-jin, contacting his old [[Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency|police task force]] for help. But they cannot assist because the [[mayor of Seoul]], whom they are guarding, has just been attacked with feces. The police are now preoccupied with a media storm because they have suffered humiliation for failing to protect the mayor.  Mi-jin awakes tied up in a bathroom. Her "customer", Je Yeong-min, calmly informs her that a previous victim had her tongue cut out for screaming too much. He tries to kill her, but she resists and Je Yeong-min hurts his hand. Moments later, callers from the local church arrive, inquiring about its owner, Mr. Park. Yeong-min has no time to finish off Mi-jin so he invites the elderly couple in and butchers them.    While trying to ditch the couple's car, he collides with Joong-ho's vehicle. Joong-ho senses that the man is hiding something, and calls the customer's cellphone, establishing that this is the man he is looking for. Yeong-min tries to run away but is caught and badly beaten by Joong-ho. Both men are arrested by a suspicious local cop. At the station, Yeong-min casually admits that he has killed up to nine people. A fracas starts when competing divisions all want to investigate the high-profile unsolved murders in the area.  Despite his confession, the police have no physical evidence, so they cannot detain Yeong-min for long. To get evidence, Joong-ho goes to Mi-jin's apartment to collect DNA samples. In the apartment, he discovers Eun-ji, Mi-jin's daughter, home alone. Reluctantly he takes her with him while he follows up a lead in Yeong-min's home town. There, he learns the suspect had been sent to prison for three years for [[Lobotomy|lobotomizing]] his own nephew. Joong-ho finds a shabby room where Yeong-min had once lived. On the walls are a host of religious drawings. Eun-ji wanders off, following a woman who looks like her mother. Off camera, she is apparently knocked down in a hit and run. After a frantic search, Joong-ho finds her and takes her to a hospital. He signs the forms as her father.  Time has run out for the police. The prosecutor's office orders that Yeong-min be released because the police have no evidence. The prosecutor tells the chief that the arrest, the suspect's injuries and rapid confession will be portrayed as the police's attempt to save face. To avoid political fallout, Yeong-min is released without charge. At the same time, the chief orders the arrest of Joong-ho as a scapegoat because he attacked the suspect. The former cop escapes from the police to continue looking for Mi-jin.  Meanwhile, Mi-jin has freed herself and escaped from the house and the garden full of human remains. Badly injured, she finds help at a nearby corner shop. Yeong-min stops at the same shop to buy cigarettes. The shopkeeper innocently tells him what has happened to Mi-jin and that there is a "maniac" loose. He kills the shopowner before killing and decapitating Mi-jin. Arriving shortly thereafter, Joong-ho finds the street cordoned off by the police and the store a bloodbath.  The police, now realizing that they have again been humiliated, throw everything into the search for Yeong-min. Joong-ho, distraught at what has happened, visits the local church, a link between the house callers and the car that Yeong-min had been driving. Joong-ho notices that the statue of the crucified Jesus matches the drawings he had seen in the room. Inquiries with the [[deacon]] lead him to the sculpture "assistant" who was staying at Mr Park's house.  On arrival, Joong-ho discovers a now smartly-dressed Yeong-min, carrying his bag of tools, just about to depart. A massive fight ensues in which a fish tank containing Mi-jin's head and body parts is smashed. Eventually Joong-ho prevails but just as he is about to bring a hammer down on Yeong-min's skull the police burst in and restrain the former policeman. As Joong-ho is pushed face down to the ground, he looks into the dead eyes of Mi-jin. The police digs up Yeong-min's many buried victims.  The film ends with Joong-ho sitting silently in the hospital room alongside Eun-ji's bed. He takes her hand in his own.  
Chaturanga (film)
 Based on the novel by author [[Rabindranath Tagore]], ''Chaturanga'' is about a love caught between conflicting worlds of ideas. Set in Colonial Bengal at the turn of the twentieth century, the film weaves a rich tapestry of crisscrossing desires and moralities.The lead protagonist Sachish fleets from radical positivism to religious mysticism in his quest for life's meaning. However, his search ultimately yields nothing but crushing disillusionment. This is because he cannot square his abstract ideals with the powerful presences of two women in his life. One of them is Damini, a young Hindu widow, and the other is Nanibala, the abandoned mistress of Sachish's own brother.Sachish tries to convince himself that Nanibala is simply a helpless woman who needs to be 'rescued' by him. Similarly, during his later religious phase, he pretends that the widow Damini is merely an enticement of Nature that must be avoided at all costs for spiritual salvation. Chaturanga thus becomes, after a point, a psychodrama of unbelievable cruelty. Nanibala becomes a victim of it because as a 'fallen woman' she can only be 'saved', but her humanity cannot be recognized. Damini is first given away by her dying husband, along with all her property, to a religious guru. She then falls in love with Sachish who can accept her only without her sexuality.

The Children of Huang Shi
 [[George Hogg (adventurer)|George Hogg]] ([[Jonathan Rhys-Meyers]]) is a young British journalist from [[Hertfordshire]] in [[England]]. In 1938, a year after the Japanese invasion of northern China and occupation of central coastal areas, he sneaks into [[Nanjing]], China, by pretending to be a Red Cross aid worker. Arriving in [[Nanjing]], Hogg witnesses and photographs the poverty, ruins, and corpses on the streets.  He proceeds to write a daily journal about his findings when he is interrupted by the sounds from outside. Upon peering outside the window, Hogg witnesses Japanese soldiers round up Chinese refugees and proceed to massacre the group. He anxiously takes photos of this event by the window. Later at night, Hogg is captured by the Japanese while photographing them committing atrocities. He is about to be executed when Chen Hansheng ([[Chow Yun-fat]]), a Chinese [[communist]] resistance fighter, saves him. While hiding in the rubble with Hansheng, Hogg witnesses the execution of two of his colleagues by the Japanese. Overwhelmed by shock, he inadvertently reveals their presence. A firefight ensues, and Hogg is wounded. He wakes up to Lee Pearson ([[Radha Mitchell]]), checking on his wounds and discovers he has been brought to a rebel camp. With nowhere to go for now, Hansheng tells Hogg, on Lee's suggestion, to rest at an orphanage housing 56 young boys and only an aged grandmother to take care of them. However, on the night of his arrival, Hogg is called out by one of the boys to a strange location, and he is savagely attacked with sticks by the orphans.  Thankfully, Lee arrives just in time and threatens to abandon the boys, leaving them without medical supplies or food. Lee explains to Hogg that she runs the orphanage and drops by from time to time with supplies.  The next day, at Lee's insistence, Hogg helps her to convince the boys that the treatment of lice by flea powder does not hurt. Lee's demonstration of the treatment on a naked Hogg, in the middle of the courtyard, manages to convince the boys and they all promptly accept treatment. However, Lee asks Hogg to take care of the boys and states that she will be leaving for two months from March to May. Lee also leaves Hogg and the orphans with a donkey. However, Hogg replies that he has no intention to stay at the orphanage, but instead wants to go to the front lines to write, and spread the word about the war. As Hogg is leaving, he spots the grandmother looking down at him, and he reflects on his short memory at the orphanage. Reluctantly, he returns to take care of the children. Over the course of the next few days Hogg gains the boys' respect by repairing the lighting, cleaning up the old school (which is the orphanage), and being their teacher. However, as for food, the grandmother had previously shown Hogg with a handful of maggot-infested rice, that there was close to nothing to feed the boys.   Hogg makes a trip to town with one of the boys to seek a well-known and wealthy lady, Mrs. Wang ([[Michelle Yeoh]]), with a business deal in mind. Aware that Mrs. Wang only wanted to deal with cash transactions, Hogg still proposed to Mrs. Wang that he'd be able to provide her with vegetables if she supplied him with food and seeds for now. (A later scene would reveal that the war made Mrs. Wang flexible and compassionate toward others and therefore privately willing to barter without cash) Mrs. Wang tested Hogg to see if he possessed the agricultural knowledge so by asking him to identify certain seeds. Hogg passes the test easily and returns with the boy to the orphanage leading his donkey full of food and seeds. He starts to plow the land beside the orphanage and with the help of one of the orphans, successfully grows a flourishing vegetable garden along with beautiful and tall stalks of sunflowers.  Fleeing from the nationalists who want to conscript the boys into their army to fight the Japanese, they make a three-month journey across the snow-bound Liu Pan Shan mountains to safety on the edge of the Mongolian desert, the first 900&nbsp;km on foot. To their relief, for the last part of the journey they are supplied with four trucks.  At the destination they are supplied with a building that they turn into a new orphanage. In 1945 Hogg dies of [[tetanus]]. This was foreshadowed by Lee, when she had described the horrors of the disease to him earlier.  The film features the [[Rape of Nanking]]<ref></ref> and the [[Three Alls Policy|Sankō Sakusen]],<ref></ref> and ends with a few brief interview snippets with some of the surviving orphans.

Trudi ([[Hannelore Elsner]]) and Rudi ([[Elmar Wepper]]) are an affectionate, long-married couple whose children have grown up and moved away. They live in a small [[Bavaria]]n village. Trudi learns that her husband is terminally ill. The doctor suggests a final adventure, which the two wanted to have for some time, but never managed.  Trudi decides to keep the disease secret from Rudi. She manages to convince him to visit their children and grandchildren in Berlin. But when they arrive, they realize that their children are too busy with their own lives to take care of the parents. Then they decide to drive to the [[Baltic Sea]]. But there, Trudi suddenly dies. Rudi is thrown completely off track and doesn't know how to go on. After he learns from his daughter's girlfriend that Trudi has actually sacrificed her life out of love for him, he starts to see his dead wife with new eyes.  Rudi tries to make up for the loss of his wife. As her secret passions were [[Japan]] and the Japanese [[Butoh]] dance expression, Rudi travels to visit his son in [[Tokyo]]. As the situation gets too claustrophobic, his son wishes his father to go away. Then Rudi goes to a park full of [[cherry blossom]]s. He meets an eighteen-year-old Japanese girl named Yu ([[Aya Irizuki]]). She catches his eyes because she dances Butoh there every day. Yu lives in a tent and has lost her mother only a year ago, so she understands Rudi's feelings. She helps him get by in the big city. Despite the language barrier – they have to speak English – and huge cultural differences, they soon get along very well.  Since Trudi has always talked about how much she wanted to see the sacred Mount Fuji, Rudi persuades his new companion to travel there together with him. Mount Fuji is so "shy" that it constantly hides behind clouds, so they put up in a hotel room beside a lake and wait for better weather. Rudi's health is deteriorating. One day, when he wakes up in the night restlessly and stands in front of the door, the mighty Mount Fuji greets him in the bright moonlight. Rudi lies down on the clothes of his wife, puts on make-up like a Japanese dancer, and begins to imitate the slow movements of Butoh at the lakeside. In his last vision, his dead wife appears to him and holds his hand. Then they unite to create a dance before the sublime backdrop of mountain and water. The next morning, when Yu sees Rudi's empty bed, she looks for him and finally finds him dead on the shore of the lake. In his luggage, there is a parcel written "For You, Yu". Inside the parcel, Rudi has left her his life savings.  Two contrasting scenes precede the conclusion of the film: On the one hand, in a solemn [[cremation]] [[Japanese funeral|ceremony]], his son and Yu are balancing the remaining [[Cremation|ashes]] of Rudi's bones with [[chopstick]]s in a Japanese urn. On the other hand, the last scene but one is a table discussion by his children out of complete misunderstanding of their father – their indignation at his grumpiness and adventures with Yu, and his scandalous soft spot for Trudi's clothes.  The final scene is of Yu again dancing Butoh with her pink telephone in the park.

Chocolate (2008 film)
 Zin is the [[Thailand|Thai]] lover of [[Yakuza]] boss Masashi. Zin was previously the girlfriend of Thai gangster No. 8, who was jealous of her relationship with rival gangster Masashi. After Zin chooses Masashi, he shoots his own toe as a symbolic gesture and forbids Zin from ever seeing him again. Zin asks Masashi to go back to Japan, as they would not be able to be together safely. He begrudgingly leaves.  Soon after, Zin finds herself pregnant and moves into a new place to get away from No. 8. She has a daughter named Zen who is soon found to be [[autistic]]. As Zen gets older, Zin one day decides to tell Masashi about his daughter by writing him a letter. No. 8 finds out that Zin is in contact with Masashi and is furious. He visits Zin and cuts off one of her toes to remind her that she is forbidden from seeing Masashi.  Zin is forced to move again to a house shared by a [[Muay Thai]] kickboxing school. Zen becomes infatuated with martial arts and from a young age, and learns martial arts by mimicking the moves she sees being performed by the school's students, as well as the martial arts movies that she sees on television, among them [[Bruce Lee]] and [[Tony Jaa]] films. She also has uncanny reflexes and is able to catch balls thrown at her without even looking. One day when coming home from work, Zin sees a little boy named Moom being picked on in the streets. Feeling sorry for his plight, she takes him in.  Zin then falls ill with cancer and does not have the money to pay for [[chemotherapy]] treatments. Zen and Moom attempt to make the money needed to pay for them by having people throw balls at Zen as a street performance act. However, they are not able to earn enough to keep up with the treatments. One day Moom discovers a list of debtors in an old notebook from the days when Zin was a high-interest moneylender under No. 8. In order to get money to pay for her mother's cancer treatment, Zen and Moom decide to collect on the debts. The first attempt to collect the money turns violent, and Zen uses her copied martial arts skills to fight back. This leads to further confrontations with various criminal gangs and, eventually, No. 8.  No. 8 learns that Zen is collecting debts for the sake of Zin's treatment, and Zin finds out what Zen and Moom have been doing for money when her toe is sent to her as a message. She realizes there will be retaliation from No. 8, and sends Moom to mail a letter to Masashi asking for help. Moom is captured by No. 8's gang, but No. 8 has the letter mailed anyway, because he wants to deal with both Zin and Masashi. Masashi receives the letter in Japan and leaves the Yakuza for the sake of his family. When Moom does not return, Zin goes to confront No. 8 to save Moom and try to reach a solution, bringing Zen with her. The meeting turns into a fight in which both Zin and No. 8 are wounded and No. 8 takes Zin hostage.  Zen fights through many of No. 8's crew to get her mother back and faces Thomas, a [[capoeirista]] boy with [[Tourette's]] who proves to be a match for her until she adapts to his erratic fighting style. Zen's father, Masashi, eventually makes it to the battle, but while he and Zin are fighting No. 8's men Zin is mortally wounded by No. 8. Angered by what has happened, Zen continues to battle through No. 8's men until she catches up with No. 8 and throws him off the third story of a building to his death. She returns to her mother only to find her dead. Masashi comforts his long lost daughter and adopts her.

The Christmas Choir
 Peter Brockman ([[Jason Gedrick]]) is a successful accountant and engaged to be married.  Then, nineteen days before [[Christmas]], his life is turned upside down when his fiancée Jill ([[Cindy Sampson]]) dumps him, telling him he is an emotionally detached workaholic. While drinking a soda at a lounge, he has a chance encounter with Bob ([[Tyrone Benskin]]), a [[blues]] pianist and singer, who is working there solely for tips. The two talk about their mutual love of music, and of Peter's childhood dream of becoming a musician. When Bob invites Peter to his house for dinner and a jam session, Peter is amazed by the musical abilities of the other occupants.  Unbeknownst to him, the home is actually a [[Homeless shelter|shelter]] for homeless people. He eventually meets the woman who runs the shelter, a caring, but also tough and straight-talking nun, Sister Agatha ([[Rhea Perlman]]). He decides the best way he can help the shelter and its members create income and opportunities is to organize some of the men into a [[choir]].  The choir improves, becoming more proficient each day.  Meanwhile, Peter and the other members go through their own personal problems, problems that create obstacles to the choir's success.  But they succeed, with the men growing emotionally and coping far better with their problems because of the self-respect and dignity they gain from being part of the choir. Their interdependence in the choir also leads them to helping one another in life as well.  Eventually the choir becomes truly wonderful, and successful.  They begin by performing in the subway, but soon are giving real concerts as well.  Peter also meets Marilyn, a woman who helps him grow into a far better man.  As mentioned above, the movie is based on a true story, the story of the Montreal Accueil Bonneau Choir (also known as the Montreal Homeless Choir), and its founder and director Pierre Anthian. Just one example of how this choir has transformed the lives of its members is the story of Nicolas “Colas” Allaire.  When he joined the choir he was in his 60's.  Colas was raised in an orphanage until age 17. With no formal education and no family, friends, or money, he was never able to find work. In winter he made snow caves to keep from freezing to death. Sometimes he committed crimes just to be put in jail so he would have food to eat every day. Since joining the choir, he says, “my life has been paradise. I have made friends, and I have started to support myself. I now have a small apartment, and I am happy.”  The choir ultimately went on to garner enormous success, creating six CDs, touring the world, and inspiring people everywhere.

So the Martian guy becomes the Martian and Santa Claus at the same time."  
The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian
  In [[Narnia]], almost 1300 years after the [[Pevensie]] siblings left, [[Caspian X|Caspian]], a [[Telmarine]] prince, is awoken by his mentor [[Doctor Cornelius]], who informs him that his aunt has just given birth to a son and that his life is now in grave danger. Cornelius gives him [[Susan Pevensie|Queen Susan's]] ancient magical horn and instructs him to use it if he is in dire need of help. Knowing that his Uncle [[Miraz]] would kill him in order to be king, Caspian flees. Chased by several Telmarine soldiers, Caspian falls off his horse and encounters two Narnian dwarfs and a talking badger in the woods. One of the dwarfs, [[Trumpkin]], is captured by the soldiers after sacrificing himself to save Caspian, while the other dwarf, Nikabrik, and the badger Trufflehunter, save Caspian. Not knowing that they are trying to save him, Caspian blows the magical horn, trying to summon help.  In [[England]], the four Pevensie children wait at the [[Charing Cross tube station|Strand tube station]] for their train which will take them to [[boarding school]]. One year has passed in their world after they left Narnia. Just as the train pulls into the station the station tears apart transporting them back in Narnia. There, they discover their castle, [[Cair Paravel]], was attacked and ruined in their absence. The Pevensies save a bound and gagged Trumpkin, who is about to be drowned, and they set off together.  Meanwhile, Nikabrik and Trufflehunter lead Caspian to the Dancing Lawn, where all the old Narnians have assembled. Caspian convinces them to help him win his throne. Caspian and his troops encounter the Pevensies and Trumpkin and they journey together to Aslan's How, a huge underground hall built over the [[Stone Table]]. Lucy wants to wait for Aslan, but [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]] decides they have waited long enough and suggests attacking Miraz's castle. The Narnians succeed in raiding Miraz’s castle, but Peter calls for a retreat when he realizes they are ambushed. Half of the Narnians manage to escape, but the rest are trapped by the closed gate and brutally slaughtered.  Nikabrik tells Caspian that there is a way he can claim his throne and guarantee Miraz's death. When Caspian agrees, a [[hag]] uses black sorcery to summon the [[White Witch]]. From inside a wall of ice, the Witch tries to convince Caspian to give her a drop of his blood in order to set her free. Peter, Edmund, and Trumpkin arrive and dispatch Nikabrik while Edmund shatters the wall of ice before the Witch can be freed.  Miraz and his army arrive at Aslan's How. Peter challanges Miraz to a one-on-one duel, in order to buy Lucy and Susan time to find Aslan. Peter is able to wound Miraz, but gives his sword to Caspian to finish him off. Caspian, who cannot bring himself to do it, spares Miraz's life but says that he intends to give Narnia back to its people.  Lord Sopespian, one of Miraz's generals, suddenly stabs and kills Miraz with an arrow and blames the Narnians. The Telmarines attack.   Lucy, meanwhile, has found Aslan in the woods; he awakens the [[Dryad|trees]] and the whole forest suddenly attacks the Telmarines, Lord Sopespian orders the retreat, where they are confronted by Lucy and Aslan. Aslan summons a [[river god]], which wipes out the majority of the Telmarine army including Sopesian; all of the surviving Telmarine soldiers surrender and hand over their weapons.

Before the Pevensies depart, Peter and Susan declare, much to Caspian, Edmund, and Lucy's dismay, that Aslan has told them they will never return to Narnia. Caspian and Susan kiss and the Pevensies then go back to England, leaving Caspian as King of Narnia.  
A Christmas Tale
  Junon Vuillard is Abel Vuillard's wife, and the iron-willed matriarch of the Vuillard family. Junon held her family together through many tough times, and although her willpower helped the family survive and prosper, it also has left many bad feelings among her children. Junon is still a handsome woman, and though her husband (who owns a small fabric dying plant) has become obese and clearly aged, he retains a remarkable clarity, acceptance, tolerance, and unconditional love for his family, and it is clear that he and their love for each other is the lynchpin that holds an otherwise fragmented family together, albeit uneasily.  The couple has three children, all grown and in their 30s.  Their eldest daughter is Elizabeth, who is a successful playwright who is married to an equally successful man, Claude.  They have one child, 16-year-old Paul, who is mentally ill and taking powerful medication to control his psychiatric problems.  The couple's middle son is Henri, who drinks too much and has always fought and argued with other members of the family.  He has a new girlfriend, Faunia.  Ivan is the couple's youngest son.  He is married to Sylvia, and they have two sons, Basile and Baptiste.  Henri and Ivan are close friends with Simon, their cousin who was raised with them after the death of his parents. Simon works in Abel's small fabric dying plant, but is an avid and skilled painter in his spare time.  He is also an alcoholic who has gotten in trouble many times for brawling in public.  All three men dated or were interested in Sylvia at one time, but they manipulated her to think that only Ivan loved her; she married him and grew to love him. The Vuillard family's other son, Joseph, never appears alive in this film but is its core throughout, and the presence around which everyone's psyches revolve: he died of leukemia when he was six years old, despite a desperate effort to save his life by procreating another child who could be a bone marrow donor for him. It may be that part of the siblings' poor relationship is the resentment they feel toward one another for not saving Joseph's life.  Six years prior to the Christmas gathering that is the heart of this film, Henri faced bankruptcy.  Elizabeth paid off his debts, but demanded that he never see her again, meaning he was left out of family gatherings as well.  Henri kept his promise.  The specific reason (if there is one) for this banishment remains unanswered to the very end, but there is much speculation on the part of the family members throughout the film about what precipitated it, including incest.  Just before Christmas, Junon learns that she, too, has leukemia and does not have long to live, though she is offered the potential of a longer lifespan if she gets a bone marrow transplant.  Her family gathers at the Vuillard home in [[Roubaix]], a small city in the north of France. The family immediately falls to bickering. Junon asks her children if one of them (or possibly Paul) will donate [[bone marrow]] to her that will allow her to survive.  Henri and Elizabeth cruelly fight with one another, and Henri begins drinking heavily and hides Paul's medication. Paul fears that the blood test he will have to undergo may also reveal that his father is not his biological parent.  Henri initially refuses to have the blood test, because, he claims, he has never loved his mother.  Faunia, who is Jewish, has agreed to spend some time with the Vuillards before leaving to spend the holiday with her own family.  Her honesty and gentleness have a moderating impact on Henri, and she manages to spend two days with the family before finally leaving.  On 23 December, Rosaimée visits the family for dinner and fireworks. Rosaimée was Abel's mother's friend, although it is suggested that perhaps the two women were lesbian lovers rather than "just friends." Rosaimée tells Sylvia that Simon stopped seeing Sylvia because he believed that she would be happier if she fell in love with Ivan. This deeply upsets Sylvia, who feels betrayed and manipulated by Simon. Henri finally has the blood test without anyone's knowledge, and discovers he can be a donor. He decides to do so despite his coldness toward his mother. Simon disappears on Christmas Eve and begins drinking heavily in local cafes, and the entire family rushes out into the snow to find him. Sylvia discovers him in a distant cafe, and she confesses that she knows Simon loves her.  She and Simon spend several hours talking, then return to the Vuillard home and make love.  Paul tries to tell Henri about his fears. Henri convinces him that he is not his father, a fact reinforced by the blood test, and reassures Paul that he is not a moral failure for being afraid.  The man and boy begin to bond, and Paul begins to improve almost overnight. On Christmas Day, Abel and Elizabeth discuss Elizabeth's longstanding depression, and Abel reads to her from the prologue to [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'' about how well we know – or don't know – ourselves. Abel suggests that Elizabeth fears death, and that has led to her caution and depression.  The film ends with Ivan casually discovering that his wife has had sexual intercourse with Simon (they make no real effort to hide it, waking up together in bed the next day and greeting her children from there as they come bearing tea), but the effect on him is not revealed – he seems remarkably blase, almost as though he has expected that this would happen one day.  Sylvia seems to love Simon just as he loves her, and it is suggested that the two have agreed to become lovers.  Paul decides to stay behind with Henri, who is having a positive effect on his mental health.  Henri donates his bone marrow to Junon, but she announces, seemingly before there would be medical evidence of this, that her body will reject the transplant.  Elizabeth speculates that Junon will live, but Henri is shown flipping a coin in the hospital in front of his mother and not revealing the answer.

 Chow Ti is a poor [[construction worker]]. He lives in a partially demolished house with his nine-year-old son, Dicky. Ti is eager to save money so he can continue sending his son to private school. However, Dicky is often bullied by other children and chided by his teachers at school.  One day, while at a [[department store]], Dicky begs his father to buy him a popular robotic toy called CJ1. Ti cannot afford it, and the situation ends badly when Ti spanks the stubborn Dicky in front of other customers. Dicky finds comfort in Ms. Yuen, his schoolteacher, who is passing by. That night, Ti visits the junkyard where he often picks up home appliances and clothes for Dicky. He finds a strange green orb and takes it home, telling Dicky that it is a new toy. He is hesitant at first, but later accepts it. The following evening, the green orb transforms into a cuddly alien creature that befriends Dicky. After playing with the alien, he names the alien "CJ7", and then falls asleep. He dreams that the alien will help him gain popularity and good grades at school.  When a group of students see the alien with Dicky they forcibly take it and try to cut it but nothing seems to work. At last they try to use a drill and Dicky jumps on them. Dicky tries to hit one of the students but a fat boy stops him who in turn is stopped by Maggie, a fatter and much larger girl. They are then punished for fighting. When the teacher, Mr. Cao leaves, CJ7 comes out from hiding and Dicky gets it to perform tricks for the other students and they are awed. Dicky thanks Johnny, the leader of the group of students, for not letting Mr. Cao know about CJ7. They shake hands and agree to not let the adults know about it.  At the construction site Ti shows everyone Dicky's test paper in which he scored a 100. His boss tells him that Dicky changed the marks from 0 to a 100 and is a cheater. Then Ti threatens his boss that if he continues saying his son cheated he will hit him. This results in a fight that leads to Ti running off while his boss shouts after him that he is fired. Ti meets Dicky at home and gets angry with him for lying. He takes CJ7 from him, saying he does not get to play since he does not work hard.

There he meets Ms. Yuen, who offers to help Dicky study. Ti goes back to his boss and apologizes; his boss does the same and gives him his job back. At work, an accident happens and Ti dies. Ms. Yuen tells Dicky about it just when he gets his test result in which he scores 65 - as promised, his father has left him alone.  The alien, still in the backpack which is now under the table on which Ti's dead body is lying, gets out of the backpack and uses his repairing power on the body, even though he knows it will take his full power and he will die.  The next morning Dicky finds Ti sleeping next to him. The alien comes out of the backpack, and lies on the table, powerless. The ball inside his antenna falls and disintegrates, and he turns into a doll. They try many ways to get him back but are unsuccessful.  In the end, it is shown that everything is back to normal. The fat boy is in love with Maggie who is in love with Dicky who is in love with another girl who is taken by the bully, Johnny. Ti is in love with Ms. Yuen but is "not funny enough" for her. Dicky wears the alien doll as a neck pendant all the time, expecting it to come back to life.  In the end, Dicky sees a UFO landing and many other alien dogs like CJ7 of different colors and patterns come out and realizes that the CJ7s are headed by his very own toy.  
City of Ember
 As an unspecified global catastrophe looms, an underground city, Ember, is constructed to shelter a large group of survivors. In addition, a small metal box intended for a future generation of Emberites is timed to open after 200 years. This box is entrusted to the Mayor of the City of Ember, and each mayor passes it on to his or her successor. Over time, however, the significance of the box is forgotten, and the succession is broken when the seventh mayor suddenly dies. The box opens by itself at the allotted time, but this goes unnoticed. Several decades later, Ember's generator begins to fail, while food, medicine, and other necessities are in dangerously short supply.  At a rite of passage for all graduating students of Ember City School, Mayor Cole stands before the students as they choose their adult occupations by lottery. Doon Harrow, the son of inventor and repairman Loris Harrow, is assigned "Messenger", while his classmate Lina Mayfleet is assigned "Pipeworks Laborer" and apprenticed to elderly [[technician]] Sul. Shortly afterward, the two secretly exchange assignments. At home, Lina (a descendant of the seventh mayor) finds the opened box and enlists Doon's help to decipher its contents. Gradually, they learn that it contains a set of instructions and directions for an exit from the city. Later, they also discover that Mayor Cole has been hoarding canned food in a secret vault for his own benefit while the people go hungry. After Lina attempts to report this, the mayor captures her and tries to steal the metal box, but she escapes during a blackout. Now fugitives from the mayor's police, Lina, and Doon, accompanied by Lina's little sister, Poppy, use the instructions and assistance from Sul to flee the city via a [[subterranean river]]. Meanwhile, the Mayor turns against his accomplice, Looper, and locks himself in his vault, only to be devoured by a gigantic [[star-nosed mole]] (which Lina and Doon encountered earlier). Lina, Doon, and Poppy eventually reach the Earth's surface, where, for the first time in their lives, they witness a sunrise. The movie ends as Lina and Doon tie a message to a rock and drop it from far above it into the city − where it is found by Loris.  
City Without Baseball

The Class (2008 film)
 Set wholly in a secondary school in a working-class district of Paris, where many inhabitants are foreign-born, the film follows the year of a young teacher, François Marin, and the 25 pupils aged 14 or 15 who he takes for an hour each day in French language. A loner, he walks the narrow line between maintaining discipline and gaining co-operation.  From the start, wide differences are apparent in the class over standards of dress, deportment, knowledge and application. A dispute arises over using the imperfect and pluperfect subjunctive, which he admits may be a bit of an affectation and is then labelled as gay. When pupils have to read aloud from a set book, The Diary of Anne Frank, a girl called Khoumba refuses because she does not consider it relevant to her life. In private, François forces her to apologise.  Success comes when he asks the pupils to write a self-portrait.

While investigating the legend Shawn injures himself on a tooth left in the cabin and develops a severe infection. As the infection worsens Shawn begins to experience strange visions and events, unsure if they are real or delusions triggered by the infection and a possible latent mental illness, as his own father murdered his wife and then killed himself.

After telling Fok to go towards the parking lot, he demands that Grace, Roy and Tinker be released. They flee to a patrol car that is also in the lot. Unfortunately, Bob is caught by Fok and his men, and fights against them until Fai catches up to them. Fok and his men are arrested by Detective Cheung and his Serious Crimes Unit. After Bob hands the videotaped evidence over to Detective Cheung, Fok and Tong, one of Fok's henchman, appear, and Cheung reveals that he was working with Fok.

Grace thanks him, and Bob concludes their meeting by saying, "If you're gonna call for help, no thanks! If you want dinner, then I'll consider." Bob is then reunited with his son, who is happy that his father kept his promise.  
The Cottage (film)
 Two brothers, David and Peter ([[Andy Serkis]] and [[Reece Shearsmith]]), kidnap Tracey ([[Jennifer Ellison]]), the stepdaughter of Arnie ([[Steven Berkoff]]), an underworld crime boss. After a heated conversation at the kitchen table, Peter and David retrieve the unconscious Tracey from the car trunk. As they try to get her upstairs Peter gets sidetracked by her chest not realizing that she has woken up. She headbutts him several times and Peter screams with pain. David manages to get her off him and has to fix Peter's now bloody and broken nose after tying her to the bed frame. The pair hold her for ransom in a secluded country cottage. Things begin to go wrong when Arnie's dimwitted son and stepbrother of Tracey, Andrew ([[Steven O'Donnell (actor)|Steve O'Donnell]]) delivers the ransom. Instead of money, the bag is filled with napkins. David and Peter realize that not only have they been deceived, but Arnie knew about Andrew's involvement in the scheme all along.  After Peter breaks David's phone by accidentally dropping it in water, David goes down to the village to use a telephone box to call in another ransom. While there, he happens across some sinister locals who, upon learning that he and his companions are staying at the Barnarby Cottage, warn him to keep his doors locked and not to wander. Disturbed, David returns to the cottage to find that Tracey &mdash; who has proven to be highly intelligent and resourceful, albeit foul-mouthed and somewhat [[psychopathic]] &mdash; has incapacitated Andrew and abducted Peter.  Some distance away, Peter and Tracey arrive at an ominous looking farm. Upon entering the house, they soon discover it to be the home of an insane and hideously deformed [[serial-killer]] known only as the Farmer.  After opening a trapdoor in the kitchen to reveal a secret staircase leading down into the cellar, Tracey is stabbed through the stomach by the Farmer. Terrified, Peter flees upstairs and jumps out of the bedroom window. Tracey survives her injury and calls out for Peter to help her escape too, all with the Farmer in pursuit. Peter manages to incapacitate the Farmer with a shovel, saving Tracey's life. Tracey then urges Peter to kill the madman before he regains consciousness, but he is reluctant.  As the two of them argue, the Farmer comes to and quickly amputates the end of Peter's foot with the shovel. As he is about to kill Peter, Tracey begins mocking him, ordering him to hurry up and do it. Frustrated, the Farmer suddenly turns around and gruesomely decapitates her at mouth-level with the shovel. He then knocks out a hysterical Peter and hangs him by his jacket from a meat-hook in the shed.  Meanwhile, Andrew and David, discover Andrew's hairdresser Steven ([[Simon Schatzberger]]), dying from being disemboweled, before setting off through the woods in search of Peter and Tracey, when they stumble across the dead body of one of Arnie's henchmen, who has had his throat slit. Soon after, they arrive at the farm, where they discover a shed full of severed heads. David and Andrew hurry outside, where the Farmer pins David to the ground with a [[pickaxe]] through his leg. He then chases Andrew into the nearby horse stables, where he viciously attacks him with a hunting knife before ripping his [[Vertebral column|spine]] out.  Peter comes to and manages to release himself from the hook and crawl across the ground to David. After making up for a lifetime of squabbling, they vow to fight on, and drag themselves back into the farmhouse in search of a phone. The Farmer soon reappears, tossing Andrew's severed head and spine through the window. David attempts to defend his brother, only to be suddenly impaled by The Farmer with the pickaxe. Outraged at seeing his brother murdered, Peter begins to throttle the Farmer to death by strangling him with a length of rope.  The Farmer manages to toss Peter down into the cellar and slam the door shut. But Peter still has the end of the rope, and he continues tugging on it, eventually causing the Farmer to collapse on top of the trap door. With the weight of the body on top of the door, Peter is unable to escape. With nowhere else to go, he descends down into the cellar. He flicks on his cigarette lighter to reveal the Farmer's equally insane and hideous wife and daughters standing all around him. He mutters defeated "You must be joking" before they set upon him, the lighter goes out and Peter screams as they attack him.  After the credits, Arnie and his right-hand men are seen arriving at the farm. As they step up to the front door, the Farmer suddenly rushes out at them with the pickaxe raised above his head. As he swings at them with it, the image freezes and the screen fades to black.

The Coverup
 This movie, based on a true story, centers around the 1986 investigation of the death of Kevin Thacker. Kevin Thacker of Iowa is a repeat drunk driving offender, and when he is taken into the [[Marshalltown, Iowa]], police station and questioned for his latest DUI, he attempts to escape. When he is found deceased in an alley behind the station, the town police report that he attempted to jump from the roof of the station to a nearby building, a gap too far for him to clear. He fell, and was killed on impact.   However, the parents of Kevin Thacker disagree with this story. They suspect that he was murdered by the Kendall Eldred, the police officer who questioned him. They seek the help of a personal injury attorney, Stuart M. Pepper, who works to find the evidence to prove that this was not an accidental death, but a deliberate murder and case of police brutality.  Attorney Pepper takes Eldred to court and uses evidence of Thacker's injuries, the crime scene itself, and time constraints around the time of death to disprove the possibility of Kevin Thacker falling from the rooftop. Pepper's arguments prove successful, and the court eventually finds Kendall Eldred guilty of the murder. It was all a massive cover-up made by the Marshalltown police department to hide the guilt of an officer. The truth came to light, and it was discovered that an unarmed, defenseless Kevin Thacker was killed in cold blood due to a blow from Officer Eldred.

After the librarian (Chris Courtenay) notes she's always the last to go, she packs up her belongings and heads home to find a loud, raucous party already in progress.

Jock comes through the next night with a place to stay. As they explore the building, it's revealed in a flashback with narration by Timmy that two students, Seth (Chris Jamba) and Bertha (Candace Grand Pre), who were obsessed with the nature and existence of evil joined forces with four other students in an attempt to summon a demon called [[Belial]].

They ask its name; it answers Alice. They ask where it is; it repeats 'tower' over and over until they release the shot glass. Everyone but Scott goes upstairs to the tower while Scott reviews his hidden cameras. Scott sees Alice throughout the house talking to herself and stabbing at the air. Upstairs, Jock finds Alice hanging from the rafters, dead. The movie ends with Scott watching a snippet of conversation Alice had earlier with 'Scott'.   
The Crew (2008 film)
  The film starts off with Gerard (Ged) Brennan and his crew hijacking a truck, only the truck is a dummy truck that is empty to ward of hijackers for that very purpose. The next morning, the radio news announces that a "business-man" named Leo Murphy, aka Leo the Pig, is found naked and killed on a boat out at sea. Even though the truck heist was a dud, Ged still has to pay his crew so that they don't go work for others and take jobs for other competitors; this causes a strain on his marriage with his wife Debbie. Their young son is unaware of what his father does for a living, wanting to go to "work" with his dad. When Ged goes to drop off his son at a posh, private school, their neighbor, Pamela Thompson, comes over. Pam and Deb do lines of cocaine at the house when Ged leaves; after Ged drops off his son, he drives to a desolated area where there are business people standing around. Pam's husband, Keith Thompson, is trying to get investors for a land deal, and Ged is one of the investors, but he has to front up the money to buy shares of the land; which he does not have all upfront. He gives Keith a down payment to hold a piece of the share for him, telling him that he'll get the rest soon.  John Paul, aka Ratter ([[Kenny Doughty]]), is pulling up to the crew's bar with his new lackey, Paul the Hom, who has small connections with the drug world. Outside the bar area are a group of wanna-be thugs, with a young kid, Ritchie, as the leader. They do little side jobs for the crews and others, and know bits and pieces of info here and there about the crime world. Ratter is Ged's younger brother; and he and Paul wants to take the crew into a new business venture, drugs. Ratter brought Paul along as a get-up to convince the crew to take over Leo's business turf, especially Ged, who is the crew's boss. When Paul starts talking about how much money they could make, the crew gets interested, but when Ged arrives and Paul and Ratter tries to pitch the sale to Ged, he doesn't buy into it. Ged is old-school when it comes to his crimes, and he won't mix in with the drug business because he knows that drugs is always the most riskiest of crimes; people always get caught or end up dead. Ged won't have anything to do with drugs, and throws Paul out of the bar. He wants to just stick with his truck heists, and he displays his disappointment in Ratter.  Ged meets up with Jimmy, the truck driver that was in the dummy truck. Jimmy and Ged are in the business together, with Jimmy providing info to Ged about his truck routes and shipments, and getting a cut in on the deal. Jimmy's truck company is unaware because Ged and his crew always makes the robbery authentic, even knocking out Jimmy and his co-driver. Jimmy tells Ged that there will be three shipments going out soon from his company, the new PlayStations, about 20-30 thousands of them per truck. They decide to let the first two shipments go so that the company won't be alerted, and to rob the third shipment instead, which will be the last shipment. Jimmy gives Ged all the info; routes, times, destination, etc. He also warns Ged that these truck shipments will all have GPS on them, and that they will have about ten minutes to carry out the heist before the company calls it in. Jimmy tells Ged that since this is a huge heist that he's giving to Ged and his crew, that he wants to be square away with him, and that he wants out after this last heist. Ged tells him that if the heist goes good he'll think about it, as Ged, too, wants to get out of the game.  At a barbecue that is being hosted by Ged and Debbie at their home, the whole crew is there with their wives and children. Ged tells the crew about the PlayStation job; and also informs the crew that Franner (Francis), is looking for who killed Leo, as well as hosting Leo's funeral. Franner is apparently a big time crime boss, on top of the underworld game, and Leo was one of his big guys in the business. Pam and Keith arrive at the party as well, on the invitation of Deb. Ged is distressed about this, as he doesn't want Keith and Pam, who appears to be legit business people, to mix in with the crew. However, an intoxicated Ratter, upon talking to Keith, finds out about Ged's land investment. This leads to tension, with Keith and his wife leaving the party after only being there for a few minutes. They invite Ged and his wife to a party at their house that they're having next week before they leave. Ratter confronts Ged about his land deal that he has on the side that he's keeping from the crew, and after much taunting, Ged knocks out Ratter.  Mobey, a member of the Brennan crew, has his son's communion coming up that he and his wife are preparing for, and that he keeps on annoying the crew with reminders for them to attend. The communion is on the 20th day of the month. Mobey visits a gentlemen's club frequently, that is owned by a Serbian criminal that is in the drug business, Lepi. Mobey has an outstanding tab at the club for 900 pounds, and Lepi's man, Dusan, brings it up to Mobey's attention. Ratter and Paul are also in the club, because they want to land a deal with Lepi to take over Leo's business; which Lepi was Leo's biggest customer. Instead of the supplier dealing directly with the customer, they want to be the middle-man, which was what Leo was. However, they need Lepi to front up the money for them to buy the drugs from the supplier, which is the "Irishman", Dermot. Ratter tries to get a business trade for the front-money by telling Lepi about the PlayStation job; but when Lepi finds out that his brother, Ged, isn't okay with the drug deal, Lepi doesn't want to do business. However, even without Lepi in on it, Ratter is sure that he can get him on board later on, and tells Paul to set up a meeting with the Irishman anyway. As Paul and Ratter are leaving, they see Mobey there. Mobey tells the two to forget about the whole drug deal because Ged is against it, and they pretend as if they have.  Ratter and Paul drive to a warehouse, where Ratter meets with the Irishman, the drug supplier. He asks Ratter if Franner knows about this, and Ratter reassures him that he will talk to Franner and that he'll get the okay. The Irishman tells Ratter that Leo's business was a big deal to handle, and that if he knows how to work the business then he'll go in on it, but that it's money upfront, and to talk to Franner first.  Meanwhile, Franner and his man are going around the area asking Ged and his crew if they know anything about Leo's death, as well as asking Ritchie and his young crew what they know - everyone tells Franner that they are hearing that it's the Serb gang that did it. Franner tells his man to keep an eye on Ritchie; which Ritchie informs Franner about the PlayStation heist coming up, because he gets paid by Franner for info.  Mobey gets beat up by Lepi's man, Dusan, at the club over the 900 pound tab that is still outstanding, and Ged gets a call about it when he's at the Thompson's party. Deb is upset over the loyal attention that Ged has to give the crew, and when he leaves to go see Mobey, Deb and Pam go upstairs to the bedroom where they snort lines of coke and then have sex with each other. Deb has a lesbian infatuation with Pam, a mix from the cocaine and the alienation she feels from Ged as the crime business seems to be taking its toll on him. Ged goes to Lepi to square away their two men's beef.  Before Ged goes to Lepi's club, Ratter and Paul are there first. They try to make a deal with Lepi again for him to front up the money so that they can get the drugs from the Irishman, the supplier. In return for the upfront money, Ratter tells Lepi that he will give him what he wants - Ged Brennan and his crew. Just then, Dusan tells him that Ged is outside and wants to see him. Paul starts flipping out, worrying that Ged is on to them, and keeps on trying to find a back door exit because Ged is outside the front door. Ratter keeps trying to calm Paul down, who is getting hysterical. Outside, Ged tells Lepi that it ends two ways, either they have an all out war with their crews, or their men go at it one-on-one. Lepi agrees that their men go at it one on one, and they arrange to meet at 8 o'clock in the morning the next day. After Ged leaves, Lepi flips out on Dusan for having Mobey beaten up over a 900-pound tab. He also tells Ratter and Paul to get out, that they don't have a deal with him.  At the funeral that is being hosted by Franner, Mobey is not allowed to drink at all because of his one-on-one fight in the morning with Dusan. Ged even sends him home early so that he can get rest up, but instead Mobey goes to one of the prostitutes that he frequently visits for one of his many fetishes. At the funeral reception, Franner makes it clear that he will find out who killed Leo and that he will avenge his death. Ratter asks Franner for his approval to take over Leo's business, which Franner gives him the okay for; despite asking him if Ged was in also, and Ratter telling him no. Ged sees Franner and Ratter talking and becomes suspicious and weary of the both of them.  Ged picks up Mobey in the morning and they drive out to a dock, where they wait for Lepi and Dusan to show up. Ged asks Mobey if he ever wanted to do anything else, and Mobey confides in him that he wanted to open a pet shop at one time, but that as time went on he gave up that idea. Ged tells him that he's getting out of the business, that the PlayStation is his last job, and then he's getting out. Lepi and his man show up, and then Mobey and Dusan fight their one-on-one, with Mobey winning. After Lepi's man is beaten, with the deal being that the tension is "over" between the two crews after their men fight it out; Lepi calls Ratter to tell him that he'll accept his offer and front him the money.  During Mobey and Dusan's fight, Pam and Keith are at Ged's house. Keith tells Deb that it's the last day for the land investment, and that all of the investors have to have the money in by noon. Deb tries to call Ged, who does not answer his phone because of the fight going on, so instead Deb gives Keith all of their money that they have in the house, which was 108,000 pounds. Deb and Pam goes upstairs to celebrate the deal by having sex and doing lines of coke again. Ged comes home and sees that the safe is empty and wakes up an intoxicated Deb. He is suspicious, and drives over to the Thompson's house, where the whole house is emptied except for a bottle of champagne. Deb and Ged realizes that they were scammed, and that the Thompson's were planning it for months, a wife and husband team that shafted them; clearly something that they are professionals in.  Ged tells Jimmy that he needs to move up the heist and that he's going to take one of the early truck shipments of PlayStations instead of the third one. He moved the date up to the 20th, which is Mobey's son's communion date. Ged gathers his men together to tell them about the new date, and apologizes to Ratter about what happened at the barbecue. He then gets a phone call from Franner to meet him.  He meets up with Franner and two of his men in the woods, and they are beating Ritchie, who is nailed to a tree trunk by his hands. Ged is clearly bothered by it, and tells the men to let Ritchie go. Franner tells Ritchie to tell Ged what he told him, which was that Ratter had him (Ritchie) kill Leo. Ged doesn't believe it, and points his gun at Ritchie and then at Franner; which Franner and his men have their guns aimed at Ged as well. Ged is distraught because he knows that Ratter will be killed, and he tells Franner that he saw him give Ratter the nod at the funeral reception, that he gave Ratter the okay; which Franner replies that he gave him the okay for the business, not to kill Leo. Franner then asks Ged if he's his brother's keeper, which Ged remorsely says no. Franner tells Ged not to do the heist, that the Serbs will be involved as well, and that it will be a whole big mess. Ged confides to Franner that he has to do the job because he was scammed out of all his money on the "land deal", that he had checked up on Keith and Pamela, and they seemed legit; and he felt that he was losing his touch. Franner asks him who scammed him, and Ged tells him that it was a husband and wife team, and the guy went by the name of Keith Thompson. Franner tells Ged again not to do the job, and then leaves him there with Ritchie, for Ged to kill him. Ged is distraught over having to kill Ritchie, especially since Ritchie keeps pleading with him, telling him that he's just a young kid; but Ged has to kill him because he was the one that killed Leo, and Franner is going to kill Ratter.  On the 20th, Ged and his men wait for Jimmy's truck, which is a last minute change for the crew. Everyone is there except for Ratter, and Ged tells one of his guys, George, that Ratter isn't coming. In flashbacks, it shows Ged and Jimmy planning out the heist, and Jimmy telling Ged that the truck company will be sending out dummy trucks as well. Ged tells Jimmy that he wants all the info on the dummy trucks as well as the shipment trucks. When his crew sees Jimmy's truck, they hijack it, beating up the co-driver, and knocking out Jimmy after they open the trailer, which is loaded with PlayStations, to the relief of Ged.  Ratter and Paul go to meet Franner and the Irishman. When they are all standing before each other, Franner confronts Ratter about Leo's death, which Paul panicks and runs, but the Irishman shoots him dead with a sniper rifle, and then Franner shoots Ratter in the head at close range with a pistol. Meanwhile, Franner's men and Lepi and his men are trying to hijack the same truck, which they think is the PlayStation job as they only knew the details from the original information that Ged gave to his crew; which Ratter gave to Lepi, and Ritchie told to Franner, but it turns out to be one of the dummy trucks instead. Franner's men kills all of the Serbian crew, including Lepi, and then Franner's man calls him to tell him that the truck was a dummy.  Franner meets Ged at Mobey's son's communion party, where Franner gives Ged a piece of paper and tells him to take care of himself, knowing that Ged wanted out. The piece of paper is information to the location of "Keith and Pamela". The movie ends with Keith and Pam at a house, in a swimming pool, and Ged walking down a pathway with a gun heading towards the house - presumably to kill them.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)
 In August 2005, elderly Daisy Fuller is on her deathbed in a [[New Orleans]] hospital as [[Hurricane Katrina]] approaches. She starts rambling to her daughter, Caroline, about a train station built in 1918 and Mr. Gateau, the best clockmaker in all of the South, who was hired to make a clock for it. Mr. Gateau was blind, and lost his son in [[World War I]], which crushed him, but he continued to labor over his clock. When it was unveiled at the station, the public was surprised to see that the clock ran backwards, to which Mr. Gateau says he made it that way so that the boys they lost in the war could come back again and live their lives that were ended too soon. After that, Mr. Gateau was never seen again, and people speculated he died of a broken heart or went out to sea.  Daisy then asks Caroline to read aloud from the diary of Benjamin Button.  From the reading, it is revealed that on the evening of [[November 11, 1918]], a boy was born with the appearance and physical maladies of an elderly man. The baby's mother died after giving birth, and the father, Thomas Button, abandons the infant on the porch of a nursing home. Queenie and Mr. "Tizzy" Weathers, workers at the nursing home, find the baby, and Queenie decides to care for him as her own.  Benjamin learns to walk in 1925, after which he uses crutches in place of a wheelchair. On Thanksgiving 1930, Benjamin meets seven-year-old Daisy, whose grandmother lives in the nursing home. He and Daisy become good friends.  Later, he accepts work on a [[tugboat]] captained by Mike Clark. Benjamin also meets Thomas Button, who does not reveal that he is Benjamin's father. In Autumn 1936, Benjamin leaves New Orleans for a long-term work engagement with the tugboat crew; Daisy later is accepted into a dance company in [[New York City]] under choreographer [[George Balanchine]].  In 1941, Benjamin is in [[Murmansk]], where he begins having an affair with Elizabeth Abbott, wife of the British Trade Minister. That December, Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacks Pearl Harbor]], thrusting the United States into [[World War II]]. Mike volunteers the boat for the [[U.S. Navy]]; the crew is assigned to salvage duties. During a patrol, the tugboat finds a sunken U.S. transport and the bodies of many American troops. A German submarine surfaces; Mike steers the tugboat full speed towards it while a German gunner fires on the tugboat, killing most of the crew, including Mike. The tugboat rams the submarine, causing it to explode, sinking both vessels. Benjamin and another crewman are rescued by U.S. Navy ships the next day.  In May 1945, Benjamin returns to New Orleans and reunites with Queenie. A few weeks later, he reunites with Daisy; they go out for dinner. Upon failing to seduce him afterward, she departs. Benjamin later reunites with Thomas Button, who, terminally ill, reveals he is Benjamin's father and wills Benjamin his button company and his estate.  In 1947, Benjamin visits Daisy in New York unannounced but departs upon seeing that she has fallen in love with someone else. In 1954, Daisy's dancing career ends when her leg is crushed in an automobile accident in [[Paris]]. When Benjamin visits her, Daisy is amazed by his youthful appearance, but, frustrated by her injuries, she tells him to stay out of her life.  In 1962, Daisy returns to New Orleans and reunites with Benjamin. Now of comparable physical age, they fall in love and go sailing together. They return to learn that Queenie has died, then move in together. In 1967, Daisy, who has opened a ballet studio, tells Benjamin that she is pregnant; she gives birth to a girl, Caroline, in the spring of 1968. Believing he can not be a proper father to his daughter due to his reverse aging, Benjamin departs after selling his belongings, leaving a bank account book holding the proceeds behind for Daisy and Caroline; he travels alone during the 1970s.  Benjamin returns to Daisy in 1980. Now married, Daisy introduces him, as a family friend, to her husband and daughter. Daisy admits that he was right to leave; she could not have coped otherwise. She later visits Benjamin at his hotel, where they again share their passion for each other, then part once more.  In 1990, widowed Daisy is contacted by social workers who have found Benjamin—now physically a pre-teen. When she arrives, they explain that he was living in a condemned building and was taken to the hospital in poor physical condition, and that they found her name in his diary. The bewildered social workers also say he is displaying early signs of [[dementia]]. Daisy moves into the nursing home in 1997 and cares for Benjamin for the rest of his life.   Daisy says that in 2002, a new clock replaced Mr. Gateau's in the train station, a digital clock that ran forward, not backwards. Then, a year later in the spring of 2003, Benjamin dies in Daisy's arms, physically an infant but chronologically 84 years of age. Having finally revealed the story of Caroline's father to her, Daisy dies as [[Hurricane Katrina]] approaches.  The final scene of the movie ends with Benjamin’s narration about what people were brought into this world for, recapping all the individuals that he loved and lost throughout his life. The film ends with alarms wailing as Katrina quickly floods a dimly lit storage room that holds Mr. Gateau’s forgotten clock, which continues to tick backwards.

The Dark Knight (film)
 A gang of criminals rob a [[Gotham City]] mob bank, murdering each other until only the mastermind remains: the [[The Joker (The Dark Knight)|Joker]], who escapes with the money.  [[Batman]], District Attorney [[Harvey Dent]] and Lieutenant [[Jim Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]] form an alliance to rid Gotham of [[organized crime]]. Bruce Wayne believes that, with Dent as Gotham's protector, he can retire from being Batman and lead a normal life with [[Rachel Dawes]]&nbsp;– even though she and Dent are dating.  Mob bosses [[Sal Maroni]], Gambol, and the Chechen hold a [[Videoconferencing|videoconference]] with their corrupt accountant, Lau, who has taken their funds for safekeeping and fled to [[Hong Kong]]. The Joker interrupts and warns them that Batman has no jurisdiction and is unhindered by the law, offering to kill him in exchange for half of their money. After Gambol puts a bounty on his head, the Joker kills Gambol and takes over his gang. The mob ultimately decides to take the Joker up on his offer.  Batman finds Lau in Hong Kong and brings him back to Gotham to testify, allowing Dent to apprehend the entire mob. The Joker threatens to keep killing people unless Batman reveals his identity, and starts by murdering Police Commissioner [[Gillian B. Loeb]] and the judge presiding over the mob trial. The Joker also tries to kill Mayor Anthony Garcia, but Gordon sacrifices himself to stop the assassination. Dent learns that Rachel is the next target.  Bruce decides to reveal his secret identity. Before he can, however, Dent falsely announces that ''he'' is Batman. Dent is taken into protective custody, but the Joker appears and attacks the convoy. Batman comes to Dent's rescue and Gordon, who faked his death, apprehends the Joker, securing a promotion to Commissioner. Rachel and Dent are escorted away by detectives on Maroni's payroll; Gordon later learns that they never arrived home. Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals that they have been trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives. Batman races to save Rachel, while Gordon attempts to rescue Dent. Batman arrives at the building, but realizes that the Joker sent him to Dent's location instead. Both buildings explode, killing Rachel and disfiguring half of Dent's face. The Joker escapes with Lau, whom he later kills along with the Chechen.  Coleman Reese, an accountant at [[Wayne Enterprises]], deduces that Bruce is Batman and tries to go public with the information. Not wanting Reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the Joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless someone kills Reese within an hour. Gordon orders the evacuation of all the hospitals in Gotham and goes to secure Reese. The Joker gives Dent a gun and convinces him to seek revenge for Rachel's death, then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. Dent goes on a killing spree, deciding the fates of people he holds responsible for Rachel's death by flipping his lucky coin.  After announcing Gotham will be subject to his rule come nightfall, the Joker rigs two evacuating ferries with explosives; one containing civilians and the other containing prisoners. He says that he will blow them both up by midnight, but will let one live if its passengers (who have been supplied the trigger to the other boat's explosives) blow up the other. Batman finds the Joker by using a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of [[Lucius Fox]]. Both the civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while Batman apprehends the Joker after a brief fight. Before the police arrive to take the Joker into custody, he gloats that Gotham's citizens will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public knowledge.  Gordon and Batman arrive at the building where Rachel perished. Dent shoots Batman, spares himself, and threatens to kill Gordon's son, claiming that Gordon's negligence is responsible for Rachel's death. Before he can flip for the boy, Batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building to his death. Batman persuades Gordon to hold him responsible for the killing spree to preserve Dent's heroic image. As the police launch a manhunt for Batman, Gordon destroys the [[Bat-signal]], Fox watches as the sonar device self-destructs, and [[Alfred Pennyworth]] burns a letter from Rachel saying she planned to marry Dent.

Dante 01
 Deep in space, above a fiery planet named [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], orbits the [[space station]] called "Dante 01". It hosts a psychiatric detention center that currently hosts six prisoners whose crimes were so severe that they volunteered to live under experimentation. The center is owned by a pharmaceutical company called Neurinos and directed by a man named [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], with the assistance of psychiatrist Dr. [[Persephone|Perséphone]] and two security guards called [[Cerberus|CR and BR]].  One day, a Neurinos shuttle arrives with a new scientist named [[ELIZA|Elisa]], carrying a new prisoner of unknown origins who was found as the sole survivor in a shipwreck and wakes up from the hypersleep severely disoriented and unable to speak. He is introduced to the other inmates: their leader [[Caesar (title)|César]]; his right-hand man [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazare]], who developed the ability to hold his breath to escape the gas with which the prisoners are sedated; the large and violent [[Moloch]], who's César's enforcer; the reclusive [[Buddha (title)|Bouddha]], who has the habit of trying and murdering whoever is in pain out of misguided compassion; the deranged anarchist [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] [[Attila]]; and [[Grigori Rasputin|Raspoutine]], a deeply religious man who claims the new one was sent by God to save them, and starts calling him "[[Saint George|Saint-Georges]], the Dragonslayer", because of a tattoo on his arm.  Elisa and Perséphone are at odds over their research methods, since the latter advocates a humanist approach to the prisoners' mental issues, while Elisa has been sent there to experiment with a new [[nanotechnology]] that directly modifies the patient's DNA, eliminating the genetic component of their antisocial behaviors. Charon asks Attila to hack into Elisa's files to find out the extent of her orders. Much to his horror, Attila finds out she's authorized to kill them all for the sake of her research.  As expected, Bouddha attempts to strangle Saint-Georges in order to alleviate his suffering. This leads to infighting amongst the prisoners, so they get gassed, and Bouddha becomes Elisa's first subject. She injects him with [[nanorobotics|nanites]] and returns him to the prison hold. Bouddha is immediately wracked by unbearable pain from the nanites bonding with his DNA, but Saint-Georges is somehow able to remove them from him (from his point of view, he's removing some kind of energy creature from Bouddha and eating it), so Bouddha becomes well again and as convinced as Raspoutine that Saint-Georges is a miracle worker, so he befriends him, swearing to protect him from the others. Later, Moloch attacks Saint-Georges, but Raspoutine inserts himself, causing Moloch to accidentally slit his own throat with the [[shiv (weapon)|shiv]] he was holding. Gas pours in to knock the group out again, but not before Saint-Georges had run over to assist Moloch. The prison guards rush in only to discover, to their amazement, that Moloch has no wound on his throat, and is alive and well. On their way out, they inject César with the nanites.  Perséphone's assumption that Saint-Georges is a miracle worker is scoffed at by Elisa, but Moloch's own doubts prompt an increasingly debilitated César to fear an impending usurping of his authority, so he commands Lazare and Moloch to get rid of Saint-Georges. While Bouddha and Raspoutine are distracted, Saint-Georges is stabbed to death by Lazare. However, while the staff is examining his corpse, Saint-Georges wakes up completely healed, grabs Elisa and uses her as a hostage to reach the prison quarters before releasing her.  César is now in severe pain from the nanites, but Saint-Georges cures him as well. Attila appears and tells the others of his plans to destroy them all out of spite, by making the space station crash into the planet, triggering the rage of the other prisoners. Attila manages to run away, only to be found later in a shaft, having hanged himself.  With Attila dead, the only way to save the station is to activate the manual override located under a trapdoor below the prisoner's quarters. The prisoners agree to let the staff through, but Elisa refuses to accompany the others inside the prisoner area. As all the station inhabitants work together to open the hatch, the gas goes off, knocking everyone but Lazare out.  Elisa prepares to escape via shuttle, but Lazare ambushes her, forcing her to let him in the shuttle as well. As the others awaken, one of the guards finds out about Elisa's betrayal, but also that Attila had messed with the shuttle controls as well, resulting in the shuttle burning through the planet's atmosphere. After having finally opened the hatch, the group finds the cooling system overheated so now the corridor that leads to the manual controls is filled with boiling water. César realizes he is the only one short enough to fit into the little space, and volunteers to descend, wrapped in some protective fabrics. He emerges on the other side horribly burned and dies in the compartment before being able to enter the code necessary to reset the controls.  In the [[epilogue]], Perséphone's narration recounts how Saint-Georges fulfilled his destiny by slaying the "dragon". We see him emerge from the station in a space suit and float above the planet, using the full extent of his inexplicable powers and the mysterious energy creatures that now reside inside him to [[Terraforming|terraform]] Dante into a livable planet, while his body disintegrates in space as a result of the transformation.

On the way to the prom, Mitch takes Lindsey to the cemetery to "loosen occurrences but kept it quiet to keep his job. He instructs them on how to kill the zombies before running off. The three get surrounded again, but Lindsey comes to the rescue and they all escape in Mitch's car.  After making a pizza delivery and discovering that a family is now zombies, Jimmy finds a crashed truck with his enemy Kyle as the only survivor. Jimmy and Kyle run into a cheerleader named Gwen, and the three are attacked. They manage to kill all of the zombies with a bat they find and a gun Kyle carries in his truck. Unfortunately, Jimmy's truck is stolen by two zombies, leaving the three without a getaway vehicle. In another neighborhood, Nash Rambler ([[Blair Redford]]), Jensen and Dave the Drummer are in the middle of writing a new song for their band. Nash asks Jensen to open the garage door to let in some air because Jensen has been smoking pot, and they discover zombies when Jensen opens the garage door. The zombies attack, but the band members also accidentally find that the zombies like music and they keep playing to keep the zombies at bay, but also inadvertently attracting more.  Mitch's car breaks down, and Lindsey, Jules, George, and Steven take refuge in a nearby house. Jimmy calls Lindsey to find her. He, Kyle and Gwen then make their way to the house through the town sewers. On the way, they discover a substance that the power plant dumped that they believe caused the re-animation of the dead. The house in which their friends are hiding turns out to be a funeral home. Fumes from the power plant re-animate the corpses stored there. Kyle and Jimmy kill them all, but not before Kyle is bitten in the neck and turns into a zombie and the others are forced to beat him to death. Gwen manages to retrieve the funeral home's hearse and the group escapes with the intent to rescue their fellow students from the prom. On the way to the school, the hearse's tires are shot out. The teens also discover their coach is still alive, and after telling him what has happened, he helps arm them. The group heads for the prom in the coach's Hummer. On the way, they find and rescue the besieged band. The band then joins the group to stop the zombies.  At the school, they find all of the town's zombies have gathered there and that they've arrived too late to save everybody. The coach decides to use his explosives to blow up the school. While the coach starts setting up around the school, the schoolkids block all the doors so the zombies can't escape. While looking through the school, the SciFi club members find a small group of survivors, including the prom queen, and start to lead them out to safety.  The coach accidentally drops the detonator into a chip bowl. Jimmy, however, is forced to go back for it, and Lindsey follows him. They sneak through the gym to get to the detonator but are noticed and attacked. Before they can be killed, the onstage band starts playing to distract the zombies. Jimmy and Lindsey dance while looking for the remote.  On the way out the others are attacked but manage to kill their attackers, while Gwen hides the fact that she was bitten. She pulls Steven, for whom she has developed feelings, into the bathroom. There she reveals the truth and the two kiss, but she turns into a zombie and bites Steven's tongue off. She kills him, which turns Steven into a zombie as well. The two zombies kiss again and then start to eat each other.  In the gym, Jimmy and Lindsey are still looking for the detonator when a zombie accidentally pulls the plug on the band's instruments, stopping the music and causing the zombies to attack again. While the two hold off the zombies, Jenson tries to replace the plug. Jimmy and Lindsey are forced to hide beneath the bleachers, where they are attacked by Mitch, now a zombie. The two escape with Lindsey killing Mitch. The band manages to plug in their instruments and begin playing, allowing Jimmy to get the detonator. As the group attempt to make their escape, Jensen is caught and killed by the horde. The surviving four make their way out of the school through a window. The zombies are unable to escape out the locked doors, and Jimmy blows up the school, killing all of the zombies while kissing Lindsey at the same time rekindling their relationship.  The survivors, including a group that hid at the prom, take a bus to a pancake house for breakfast courtesy of the coach with a plan to eat and plan an attack to shut down the power plant and prevent the zombie plague from spreading. The gravedigger also survives and complains about the fact he has to clean up the mess.

Dark Planet (film)
  === Part I ===  Year 2157. [[Maxim Kammerer]] (Stepanov), a space explorer from Earth, [[crash landing|crash lands]] on an unknown planet. His ship is destroyed, and now he's stuck there "like [[Robinson Crusoe|Robinson]] on an uninhabited island" (hence the title). Maxim encounters local military police, who don't believe Maxim is alien and send him to mental hospital in the capital. Guy Gaal (Fyodorov), a corporal of the Guards, is assigned to escort Maxim.  Maxim learns that the name of the planet is [[Saraksh]], and the country where he landed is called Fatherland, because it's ruled by a [[militaristic]] [[dictatorship]] of the ''Unknown Fathers''. Strider (Serebryakov), a powerful figure in the government, wants to see the newcomer; he sends one of his men, Funk, after Maxim, but as they drive the street, Funk suffers from what seems to be a surge of epilepsy, and Maxim is left alone. He encounters Rada Gaal (Snigir), a sister of Guy, falls in love with her and stays with the Gaals. Guy talks Maxim into becoming a privateer ("candidate") in the Guards. They are forced to participate in brutal raids against the people called "degenerates" by state propaganda. After Maxim refuses to execute a group of captured "degenerates", Guards commander Rittmeister Chachu shoots him and leaves him to his apparent death.  However, Maxim survives and joins a group of rebel "degenerates". During his time with the rebels, Maxim learns the true nature of the regime and the purpose of towers erected across the country. Contrary to state propaganda, the towers function as [[mind control]] devices, sending a special kind of radiation that ensures the citizens' loyalty to the regime. Twice in a day, the majority of people experience a patriotic frenzy, while minority, the "degenerates", are able to resist brainwashing, but they suffer from intense pain and convulsions. Unknown Fathers themselves are known to be "degenerates" (this is highlighted by Funk's "epilepsy" earlier). Maxim realises that rebels are hiding the truth just as the government does, in hope that they might use the towers themselves, had they come to power.  After fighting alongside the "degenerates" in the attack on a tower, Maxim is again captured by the military and sentenced to a prison labor camp. There, inmates are tasked with cleaning the wilderness of automated defense systems that were left abandoned by decades of war. On a mission, Maxim manages to capture a mechanized tank. He drives the tank away from detention zone across the minefield, picks up Guy, and heads south to the neighbouring nations.  === Part II ===  The second part is named ''Rebellion'' (). it starts with a brief description of the first part plot.  Maxim reveals the true purpose of the towers to Guy, who does not believe at first but is convinced when his enthusiasm fades as they get farther from the towers. They arrive in a city ruined by atomic bombing and inhabited by mutants. Maxim tries to convince mutants to start a rebellion against Unknown Fathers, but, being too weak, they refuse. Maxim then decides to seek help from another powerful country on Saraksh, the Islands Empire. Mutants give Maxim a bomber airship to fly for the Empire.  As Guy and Maxim travel the airship, Guy is again hit by the towers' radiation. He starts hysterically screaming of his loyalty to Maxim and hugging him. To stop it, Maxim collides the airship into the Tower and destroys it. After crash-landing at the shore, Maxim and Guy discover an abandoned Imperial White Submarine. There, they find evidence that Islands Empire is even worse mass-murdering fascist regime which wouldn't help their goals.  Meanwhile, the Unknown Fathers are planning an invasion of the neighbouring country of Khonti. As soon as Maxim and Guy return to Fatherland, they are captured and sent to war along with fellow prisoners, where Guy is killed in a battle. Funk, following Strider's orders, finds Maxim and takes him out of the war back to the capital. Fatherland is defeated, and the State prosecutor, who was an active supporter of the war, realizes that the Unknown Fathers will execute him for failure. He contacts Maxim and reveals the location of the Tower Control Center, urging him to use it for a coup d'état. Maxim sneaks in, but instead of following the prosecutor's plan, he blasts the Center with explosives.  As he exits the Center, he's confronted by angry Strider. He berates and beats Maxim and reveals himself as undercover spy from Earth. Maxim, a well-intentioned amateur, ruined the plan to save Fatherland and the rest of the planet that Strider has been preparing for decades. Strider tells Maxim to fly home to Earth. Maxim refuses and offers his help on one condition: another brainwashing center can never be built. After a fight and a heated argument, Strider reluctantly agrees. The final sequence shows rebels overthrowing the Unknown Fathers.

 In [[Leadville, Colorado]], May 2008, Trevor and his girlfriend, Nina, have a romantic encounter in an abandoned building. As they return to their respective parents' homes, they encounter a military roadblock. An angry man demands medical care for his child, revealing an outbreak. The teens meet Captain Rhodes and Corporal Sarah Cross. Soon after, privates Bud Crain and Salazar show up, and Bud immediately falls in love with Sarah. Sarah and Bud visit her sick mother, and she to her brother, Trevor. Sarah visits Trevor's friend, Kyle, after she learns his symptoms are similar to her mother's.  When Bud and Sarah arrive at Kyle's house, they find the mauled bodies of his parents stashed behind a curtain and Kyle missing. They radio Captain Rhodes and take Nina, Trevor, and their mom to the local hospital. There, Sarah talks to Dr. Logan at the urging of Rhodes, while out in the waiting room all the infected become catatonic. Bud runs to alert Sarah, when all the infected suddenly reanimate. They turn into zombies, transforming while catatonic. They have superhuman strength that allows them to run, jump long distances, and crawl on the ceiling.  Nina and Trevor escape, seeking refuge in the local radio station. Captain Rhodes fights off the zombies before perishing. After becoming trapped in a storage room, Sarah, Dr. Logan and Bud crawl through ceiling ducts into another room, where they find Salazar. Uninfected, he returns with them through the ducts to the storage room. The transformed Rhodes, also in the room, pursues them through the duct and nearly catches up with Sarah. Though she escapes, Rhodes bites Bud's hand as he replaces the ceiling grill.  After dispatching Rhodes, the four escape from the hospital by jumping from the store room window into the car park, which is overrun with zombies. Here they discover the zombies can be killed by shooting them in the head or setting them on fire. In the confusion, Dr. Logan deliberately pushes a non-infected girl into the path of the zombies and escapes in an abandoned vehicle.  Sarah, Bud and Salazar win their battle with the zombies and drive away in a military vehicle. They make a stop at the gun store while Bud stays in the vehicle. When Sarah and Salazar return they find Bud has transformed. Instead of killing him, Sarah insists they take him with them because Bud is restrained by plastic wrist-ties and poses no threat. Sarah and Salazar hear Trevor call for help on the radio and go to the radio station to rescue them. While driving there Sarah crashes into her zombified mother and kills her before rescuing Trevor and Nina from the radio station.  The group heads back to the abandoned warehouse. When Bud does not attack his friends, Sarah believes it is because he was a [[vegetarian]], but Salazar speculates Bud is attracted to Sarah. The group finds an underground bunker, where they reunite with Dr. Logan. They learn about a government project directed by Dr. Engel, which accidentally created the virus that turned the townspeople into zombies. The group explores the bunker, but Dr. Engel attacks and kills Logan.  Later, Salazar is swarmed by zombies and - as he perishes - allows Sarah to escape and reunite with Trevor and Nina. While hiding, they find several large gas cylinders. Sarah decides to lure the zombies into the storeroom and burn them with the cylinders. They begin modifying the cylinders into a giant flamethrower. Sarah finds and attracts a mob of zombies. The zombified Dr. Engel drops down from the ceiling behind Sarah and grabs her, but before she is bitten, Bud shoots at Engel. This leads Engel and the other zombies to attack Bud, dismembering him. Sarah  leads the zombies to the room where Trevor and Nina are hiding, and they torch the zombies. The three escape the bunker and drive off as a zombie suddenly jumps in front of the camera.  
Dasavathaaram
 Bio-scientist Govindarajan Ramaswamy speaks at the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium (Chennai)|Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium]] about [[chaos theory]] and the [[butterfly effect]]. He begins by reciting events from the 12th century in [[Chidambaram]], when King [[Kulothunga Chola II]], a [[Saivite]], persecutes [[Vaishnavites]] and intends to destroy an idol of [[Vishnu sahasranama#Some other names|Govindaraja]]. Rangarajan Nambi, a Vaishnavite, protects it and offends the king, who orders Rangarajan to be executed by being pierced, stoned, submerged into the sea with the idol, before being devoured by the shark, thus the king succeeding.  On 20 December 2004, a nano bio-technology lab in the United States designs a vector-virus intended as a [[Biological warfare|bio-weapon]]. When they were watching the indsound his pet monkey breaking out of her cage. The monkey, who thinks he has the usual chocolate Govind would feed him, unknowingly swallows the sample of the virus instead, dying in seconds. The lab room of the monkey is filled with concentrated Salt solution, and is sealed permanently. After understanding the original virus's lethal potential the hard way, Govind refuses to hand over the main single vial (containing the virus), due to fear of misuse. However, his boss, Dr. Sethu, has a malicious plan in mind, and tries to sell it to a terrorist group. Govind tries to sneak the vial out of the lab in order to save the vial from Sethu's evil plan, but is pursued by the security guard and the police. Govind flees to a friend's house for refuge, who secretly betrays  him. A police helicopter housing former CIA agent Christian Fletcher, arrives. Fletcher shoots Govind's friend and attempts to seize the vial. He firebombs the entire apartment with a grenade when a martial arts master, Yuga Narahazi, tries to defeat Fletcher and protects Govind. Govind manages to jump into another apartment's window and escapes the building before the apartment is firebombed. The deadly weapon is inadvertently couriered to India aboard a passenger aircraft, safely in Govind's hands. Govind boards into the aircraft secretly carrying the virus and changes its location. After arriving in India, he is questioned by Balram Naidu, a RAW operative. Govind unsuccessfully tries to explain the series of incidents.  Meanwhile, Fletcher, who has married an Indian assassin named Jasmine, arrives in India. Using her as a translator, Fletcher threatens Govind and takes him away in a jeep with a police officer. After exiting the city, Govind escapes from Fletcher and reaches Chidambaram. Fletcher follows him, after getting a cab, along with Jasmine. After Govind attempts to persuade the receivers of the package carrying the virus, one of the elephants in the temple is inadvertently freed and goes mad. The vial was accidentally thrown inside an idol of Govindaraja. In the chaos, Jasmine gets impaled on a blade on the wall by the elephant, and Fletcher ruthlessly shoots her instead of helping her. Govind and Andal, who is the granddaughter of Krishnaveni, an old woman for whom the package was sent, try to run away from Fletcher, and arrive in a ground where illegal [[Sand mining|sand miners]] are working. They try to rape Andal, but Govind defeats them and they sneak out after the interference of Vincent Poovaragan, a social activist, and saves an [[gigantism|unnaturally tall]] Muslim named Khalifula and his family from a car-crash in the process. One of them, a lady, faints suddenly and is taken to a hospital, where Govind procures a cooling box to store the weapon, as it is unstable and its temperature needs to be maintained. He meets pop singer Avatar Singh, who is also there for treatment of his [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. His prescription drugs are in a similar-looking box and before leaving the hospital, he unknowingly switches it with Govind's box.  Fletcher follows them and takes [[Andal]] and the Muslim family hostage in their house, from where Govind is blackmailed to bring back the box he is carrying. With no choice, he reaches the place, only to discover that Avatar must have the weapon. The police surround the house, forcing Fletcher, Govind and Andal to flee in a jeep. Shinghen Narahazi, a Japanese martial arts expert, whose sister Yuga Narahazi was earlier killed by Fletcher, follows them. Avatar finishes his last performance and discovers the blunder, only to get shot by Fletcher after having a row.  Govind and Andal flee to reach a construction site, where Govind takes out the weapon before giving the idol to Fletcher. The sun dawns on [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|26 December 2004]]. Govind gets an idea from some drainage workers to immerse the virus in a large quantity of [[Sodium chloride|salt]] to destroy it. He goes to the sea, only to be stopped by Fletcher. Shinghen Narahazi arrives and fights with Fletcher. Both Narahazi and a motivated Govind fight Fletcher together and defeat him. Fletcher opens and swallows the virus. Suddenly, a [[tsunami]] strikes, washing away Fletcher, and causing great destruction along the coast. Poovaragan's house is struck and he dies in a car after saving a child. Andal, Govind and Narahazi get into a boat. Krishnaveni arrives and cries after perceiving Poovaragan as her long-lost son. After relief measures are taken, Andal argues that god had sent forth the tsunami to get rid of the weapon. Govind responds by asking if god would destroy hundreds of lives to save millions. Then, they are later revealed to have been talking in front of the idol submerged in the 12th century. The scene shifts to the stadium, where Avatar, who had his cancerous growth taken away by Fletcher's shot, along with several others, listening to the speech by Govind with Andal as husband and wife followed by former president [[George W. Bush]] as the credits roll.

The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008 film)
  In 1928, a solitary mountaineer encounters a glowing sphere. He loses consciousness and when he wakes, the sphere has gone and there is a scar on his hand where a sample of his DNA has been taken.  In the present day, a rapidly moving object is detected beyond Jupiter's orbit and forecast to impact [[Manhattan]]. It is moving at 30,000 kilometers per second, enough to destroy all life on Earth.  The [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] hastily assembles a group of scientists, including Dr. Helen Benson and her friend Dr. Michael Granier, to develop a survival plan.  As it nears the planet, the object slows down just before impact. Revealed to be a large spherical spaceship, it lands gently in [[Central Park]]. The sphere is quickly surrounded by [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] and heavily armed [[United States Armed Forces|US military]] forces. An [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] emerges and Helen moves forward to greet it; but amidst the confusion, the alien is shot. A gigantic robot appears and temporarily disables everything in the vicinity before the wounded alien voices the command "[[Klaatu barada nikto]]" to shut down the robot's defensive response.  The alien's exterior is found to be a [[bioengineered]] space suit, composed of [[placenta]]-like material covering a human-like being. The being quickly ages into [[Klaatu (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Klaatu]], who looks like the mountaineer from 1928. Klaatu informs [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] Regina Jackson that he is a representative of a group of civilizations, sent to talk to the leaders of Earth about saving the planet. When Jackson instead sends him to be interrogated, Klaatu escapes and reconnects with Helen and her stepson, Jacob, telling them that he must finish his mission to "save the Earth".  The presence of the sphere, and other smaller ones that begin to appear all over the world, causes widespread panic. The military launches a [[drone attack]] on the Central Park sphere, but are thwarted by the robot.  The military takes a weapons-free approach, cautiously enclosing the robot, soon nicknamed "[[Gort (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|GORT]]" (for Genetically Organized Robotic Technology), and transporting it to [[Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center|Mount Weather]], an underground facility in Virginia.  Klaatu meets with another alien, Mr. Wu, who has lived on Earth for 70 years. Wu tells Klaatu that he has found the human race to be destructive, stubborn and unwilling to change, which matches Klaatu's experiences. Klaatu orders the smaller spheres to collect specimens of animal species, to preserve them for later reintroduction to the Earth. He clarifies for Helen that he means to save the Earth from destruction by humankind.  When a policeman attempts to take them into custody, Klaatu kills him then promptly revives the officer, telling Helen and Jacob that he did this to simply disarm an obstacle to his mission.  Hoping to persuade Klaatu to change his mind about humanity, Helen takes him to the home of Professor Barnhardt, a [[Nobel Prize]] winner. They discuss how Klaatu's own race went through a drastic, collaborative evolution to prevent the demise of their own planet.  Barnhardt pleads that Earth is at the same precipice, and humanity should be given a chance to understand that it too must change. While the adults are talking, Jacob calls the authorities to come and arrest Klaatu.  While the military is examining GORT, the robot transforms into a swarm of winged, insect-like, [[Nanorobotics|nano-machines]] that self-replicate as they [[Grey goo|consume every man-made object in their path]]. The swarm soon devours the entire facility, emerging above ground to continue feeding.  The military capture Helen while Klaatu and Jacob escape on foot. As they travel, Klaatu learns more about humanity through Jacob. When Jacob contacts Helen and arranges to meet at his father's grave, the Secretary sends her to try to change Klaatu's mind.  At the grave, Jacob is heartbroken that Klaatu cannot resurrect his long dead father. As Helen and Jacob have a tear-filled reunion, Klaatu's cumulative observations of humans convinces him to stop the swarm.  Dr. Granier drives them to the Central Park sphere, but the swarm has reached massive proportions.  Klaatu trudges through the swarm to the sphere, touching it moments before his own body is consumed. The sphere deactivates the swarm, saving humanity, but at the expense of electrical activity on Earth, per Klaatu's warning that there will be a price to the modern human way of life.  
Dashavatar (2008 film)
 The concept of [[Dashavatara]] (Ten [[Avatar]]s) has religious significance. Evil has been present during the evolution of mankind and the Dashavatar have been constantly present to triumph over evil. The most famous incarnations of Vishnu are Rama, whose life is depicted in the Ramayana, and Krishna, whose is depicted in the ''Mahabharata'' and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''. The four great era or epochs in Hinduism are Satya Yug, Treta Yug, Dwapar Yug and Kali Yug. Satya Yug, the Age of Truth, will last four thousand years, Treta Yug for three thousand, Dwapara Yug for two thousand and Kali Yug will last for one thousand divine years. It is believed that three of these ages have passed, and we are now in the fourth. The four ages are said to symbolize the four phases of human evolution during which man gradually lost the awareness of his inner self. Another theory explains these epochs of time on the basis of the degree of loss of righteousness in the world. It says, during Satya Yug only truth prevailed (Sanskrit [[Satya]] = truth), Treta lost ¼ truth, Dwapar lost ½ truth and Kali is left with only ¼ truth. Evil and dishonesty has replaced truth in the last three ages or yugs.  This verse from the Indian epic, The Bhagavad Gita, embodies the soul of Dashavatar. [[Lord Vishnu]], the Preserver of life, manifests Himself in many forms through the eras to wipe out evil and establish the rule of righteousness.  Dashavatar weaves together the fascinating stories of Rama, Krishna, Parshurama, Vamana, Narsimha, (sundari one who is in focus at the time of samudramanthan and help to god in getting amrit)...and the tales of Vishnu in earlier avatars&nbsp;– Matsya, Kurma,Varaha and Haygriva...and &nbsp;— Kalki Avatar! Dashavatar is an odyssey through time, showing the values of the old world matching the sensibilities of the modern one...  The nine avatars are [[Matsya]] (fish), [[Kurma]] (tortoise), [[Varaha]] (boar), [[Narasimha]] (half-man, half-lion), [[Vamana]] (dwarf man), [[Parshurama]] (man with axe), [[Rama]] (moral man), [[Krishna]] (philosophical man) and [[Buddha]] (monk). The tenth avatar, [[Kalki]] is yet to manifest.  *Matsya, The Fish, appeared in the Satya Yuga. *Kurma, The Tortoise, appeared in the Satya Yuga. *Varaha, The Boar, appeared in the Satya Yuga. *Narasimha, The Man-Lion (nara = man, simha = lion), appeared in the Satya Yuga. *Vamana, The Dwarf, appeared in the Treta Yuga. *Parashurama, The Warrior with an axe, appeared in Treta Yug. *Rama, Prince and king of Ayodhya and the Moral Man, appeared in the Treta Yuga. *Krishna, The Cowherd and Philosophical Man, appeared in the Dwapara Yuga. *Bhuddha,The Monk who attained eternity,who was once a Prince named Siddarth,appeared in the Kali Yuga. *Kalki, the Sagprince ("Eternity", or "time", or "The Destroyer of foulness"), who is expected to appear at the end of Kali Yuga, the period in which we exist, which will end in the year 428899 CE.

The Day the Earth Stopped
 The film centers on soldier Josh Myron ([[C. Thomas Howell]]) as [[number of the beast|six hundred and sixty six]] gigantic interplanetary robots land on Earth.  As the robots are landing, two humanoids arrive, one male and one female ([[Sinead McCafferty]]).  Both are eventually captured by the military who try to communicate with them.  Eventually, the female starts talking to Myron and reveals that she can read his mind along with others.  Myron is told that the entire human race is a threat to the rest of the galaxy and unless she is shown the value of humanity by sunset, the planet will be destroyed.  Attempts to communicate with the robots fail as they vaporize anyone that tries to attack them or even fires a rifle to get their attention.  An effort is made to destroy the robots using Sidewinder Missiles, delivered by [[YF-22]]s.  The missiles are ineffective and the attacking planes are destroyed by laser attack.  The woman, who reveals that her name in its closest English translation is Skye, also displays the ability to harness surrounding energy to protect herself.  However, after using that, the military officer in charge of the "mission" starts to use a [[Taser]] on Skye, forcing Myron to intervene and be thrown off the project.  He goes AWOL and as he is driving away, he is contacted by Skye telepathically and he returns to rescue her.  The effort proves successful and starts a citywide search for him and Skye.  The male also manages to escape as the robots begin a systemic attack on the planet, first with an EMP (which aids in Josh rescuing Skye).  It's also discovered that the robots are slowing down the Earth's core and stopping the planet's rotation.  An effort is made to destroy one of the robots with a nuclear explosion, sacrificing 9000 inhabitants of a small island.  When the bomb goes off, the machine emerges unharmed and Skye feels the pain of the people dying and almost passes out.  Josh takes the time to comfort Skye before the military finds them again.  Myron and Skye come across a married couple and have to put the wife in the back of a 4x4, as she is in labour.  The husband delivers the child but is unaware of a complication until he realizes that his wife has stopped breathing.  Myron hands the infant to Skye and tells her that if she wants to know the value of humanity, "you're staring at it".  Myron and the husband desperately try to revive the wife but are unsuccessful.  Myron realizes that the wife is dead and stops applying CPR.  Skye, despite her earlier statement that she would not get involved, changes her mind and uses her powers to resurrect the wife.  Skye, now convinced of the value of humanity, needs to get to the closest robot to return home and end the invasion.  Before they can get to the robot, Skye is shot by the military.  Both are taken back to the base where Skye is treated for the injury as the planet's rotation stops and a major global earthquake hits.  The commander realizes, finally, that Myron was telling the truth and helps Myron move Skye to a vehicle.  As they leave, they are chased by the psychologist, who is convinced that keeping Skye will prevent the robots from attacking further.  At the feet of the robot, Myron is shot by the psychologist; the robot, reacting to a perceived threat, vaporizes him.  The robot man arrives, sees both Skye and Myron possibly dead and uses his own powers to revive both.  Skye, in gratitude, hugs Myron before both the unnamed man and Skye are beamed aboard.  The invasion ends and the robots depart the planet leaving behind major damage (the [[Dome of the Rock]], the [[London Eye]] and the top half of the [[Eiffel Tower]] were all destroyed in the global earthquake), but the planet intact.  
Daytime Drinking
 On a drunken night out with his friends, a broken-hearted young man is swayed into going to the countryside with them for a getaway. But when he gets there, he finds that not only have none of them showed up, but the tiny seaside town is shuttered - no shops are open, no tourists are around, the beach is freezing, and there’s no [[cell phone]] signal. Unable (and reluctant) to return to [[Seoul]], he finds himself in the company of some very unusual locals and, subject to the rigid rules of Korean drinking culture, on an increasingly strange odyssey nursing a never-ending [[hangover]].  Ushering in a new era of independent filmmaking in South Korea, ''Daytime Drinking'' is a comedy in the spirit of ''[[Stranger Than Paradise]]'' and ''[[Sideways]]'', but with a distinctly Korean twist.  
Daylight Robbery (2008 film)
 Alex masterminds an ambitious plan to steal millions of untraceable cash that is stacked in the underground vaults of the London Exchange Bank, waiting for its last journey, incineration. Lucky, Matty, Terry, Chubby, Norman and Jay make up his unlikely gang of robbers. They initially set-up an airline check-in clerk as their alibi, by checking in to join the thousands of England supporters who are part of a mass exodus to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Germany]]. Then, instead of passing through to the departure lounge, the gang head out to the car park, pile into a van and head for [[Central London]], where they ram the doors of the London Exchange Bank, blocking any exit for those caught up inside.  Their plan involves a tunnel they have dug up under the bank to funnel out the cash and themselves, all within a couple of hours, in order to catch their flight out to Germany. For this purpose, they have also set up an accomplice among the hostages, who will later patch up their exit point from the bank and himself escape among the freed hostages once the police move in.  However, as soon as they break-in, they have to contend with Chubby's leg wound that he has incurred after being out of the van. Chubby passes out soon thereafter from blood loss, forcing the gang to interact with the police camped outside and get a doctor brought in to the crime scene. All this while they are running on a short two-hour deadline. Things go smoothly elsewhere, however, and they are able to hustle the bags of cash and themselves out through the tunnel. However, right at the very end, Norman, the last man out, is trapped in the tunnel when a portion in the middle collapses. Alex sends everyone else off to the airport and frantically digs Norman out, ferrying him to the airport in a cab, where he makes his flight at the very last moment.  At the end of the film, it is revealed that Chubby never recovered from his leg wound and died when the plane landed in Germany, resulting in the police being able to match together evidence from the crime scene with Matty's identity and working backwards to piece together the gang's original plan. However, Alex, who did not travel to Germany, was never caught and has since disappeared with the money. He is shown to be supporting the rest of the gang through their prison terms, as well as Chubby's widow.

Tommy wants to take Alex to [[Louisiana]] to play in a poker tournament, but Alex is supposed to start his job at his father's law firm.  Alex convinces his dad to give him a few extra days under the pretext of taking a trip with his friend.  Tommy tells his wife he has to go to Cleveland for work and the pair head to the tournament.  On the first day, Alex does really well and builds up a chip lead.  Overnight, Tommy warns Alex that the other players will try to keep him awake with distractions such as crank phone calls and knocks at the door.  Alex doesn't listen and loses sleep to the distractions, resulting in him busting out of the tournament.  Upon returning home, Tommy is confronted by his wife Helen about the money he's been using.  He admits to bankrolling Alex but swears he hasn't played a hand himself.  Unmoved, Helen packs her things and leaves Tommy.  Tommy takes Alex back to Las Vegas for another tournament, during which he tries to reconnect with Michelle but she doesn't return his calls.  Alex does well at first but starts getting flustered when he runs into another tough female opponent.  Alex finally finds his stride, finishing the tournament in the money and making $120,000.  Michelle finally calls Alex back, and the two spend the night together.  Alex tries to convince her to spend more time with him, but she tells him her father is in town and she has to leave.  Later that night, while celebrating his win with Tommy, he sees Michelle with another man and realizes she is a [[prostitute]].  Tommy tacitly admits to hiring her to help Alex relax, and an enraged Alex storms off.  The next morning, Alex leaves Tommy his share of the winnings at the hotel desk and tells him never to talk to him again.  Alex returns home to his angry parents, who know he's been playing poker rather than work.  When his father reminds him who paid for his law school, Alex throws his $60,000 at him.  Shocked at the money Alex has made, his parents reluctantly agree to let him compete in the [[World Poker Tour]] tournament in a few weeks.  Tommy, deciding he has nothing to lose, enters the tournament as well.  The two play for several days, with Alex quickly building up a chip lead and Tommy slowly grinding his way up until both players reach the final table.  That evening, Helen returns to Tommy at his hotel and apologizes for making him stay away from poker for so long.  Alex's parents also arrive, finally supporting their son's poker playing.  The next day, they both eliminate several players until it's down to just the two of them.  In the final hand, Tommy busts Alex out with a pocket pair of jacks.  Later in the evening, Tommy confronts Alex to ask about his last hand.  Alex confirms Tommy's suspicion that he had a lower pair than Tommy.  In a flashback, we see that Alex actually folded the winning hand in order to let Tommy have the title he wanted for so long.

Dead Space: Downfall
 An alien artifact, identified as a possible "second Marker", is discovered on the planet Aegis VII. The Church of Unitology uses its influence to send the mining ship USG ''Ishimura'' to retrieve this holy relic.  While the ship approaches, they receive radio reports of an outbreak of violent behavior among the colonists. The Marker is brought aboard by order of Captain Benjamin Mathius ([[Jim Cummings]]). Head of Security Alissa Vincent ([[Nika Futterman]]) asks to investigate the colony, but Mathius believes nothing is amiss. While the ''Ishimura'' extracts a chunk of the planet to mine, a man in the ship's [[sick bay]], Hans Leggio, ([[Jeff Bennett]]) struggles against his restraints and resists sedation, begging to be killed.  Meanwhile, two miners on Aegis VII check an outpost that has gone silent. One man, Farum (Cummings), vanishes during a blackout, while the other, Colin Barrow ([[Bruce Boxleitner]]) sees his wife Jen ([[Lia Sargent]]) commit suicide. Barrow takes her body and flees the facility in a shuttle, unaware of an alien presence attached to the corpse.  The ''Ishimura'' re-establishes links with the colony, receiving evidence of a massacre. The captain refuses to radio for help, as he would face a court martial for entering a restricted system. He orders that the planet be [[quarantine]]d and return to Earth with the Marker. Barrow's shuttle crashes into the ''Ishimura''s hangar just as he is killed by his mutated wife. Vincent and her security teammates Ramirez ([[Hal Sparks]]), Hansen ([[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]]), Dobbs (Bennett), Pendleton ([[Kevin Michael Richardson]]), and Shen ([[Kelly Hu]]) are dispatched to arrest and quarantine the people on the shuttle, but they find nothing aboard but pools of blood. Leggio awakens to discover alien creatures mutating the corpses in the morgue, which then kill him. The security team follows trails of blood towards the morgue, where Dobbs is killed by an infected Leggio. Tensions flare as Unitologist crew members demand to see the Marker; they are quickly calmed and dispersed by engineer Samuel Irons (Richardson), a Unitologist.  The security team fight the infestation as it spreads through the ship, with Irons joining them after saving them from the Necromorphs in the ship's mess hall where Pendleton is swarmed and killed. Dr. Terrence Kyne ([[Keith Szarabajka]]) tells Mathius that the Marker is responsible for the colonists going insane, killing each other and causing the infestation and must not be taken to Earth, fearing that the Necromorphs will wipe out every last human on Earth, but the captain claims religious persecution and [[mutiny]]. As tension rises on the Bridge, Captain Mathius is accidentally killed by Kyne in an attempt to sedate him, who flees the bridge. The escape pods are launched empty and the communications systems destroyed.  On the way to the bridge, Hansen goes insane and kills Shen, then is in turn killed by Ramirez. Vincent, Irons and Ramirez return to the bridge where they learn that the ship is almost entirely overrun; they then discover that Kyne is sabotaging the ship's engines, to [[scuttling|scuttle]] the ship on the planet to stop the Necromorphs from spreading.  On their way to confront Kyne, the team finds survivors trapped by Necromorphs. Irons buys time for Vincent and Ramirez to extract the scared crew members by using himself as bait, and is killed. Ramirez sacrifices himself getting Vincent into the control room. She confronts Kyne, who claims that his actions are necessary to stop the alien outbreak from leaving the system. Vincent fails to restore the engines, and Kyne escapes with her weapon.  Vincent finds herself surrounded by Necromorphs and runs for the Marker, but learns that the creatures cannot come into close proximity with the artifact, which kept them imprisoned on Aegis VII. Spurred on by a vision of Ramirez, Vincent leaves a video log that details the entire sequence of events, adding that the Marker and the ''Ishimura'' must be destroyed. She uploads the video log to a distress beacon, opens the airlock and launches the beacon from the downed shuttle. Vincent and the Necromorphs are blown out into [[outer space|space]].  Vincent's body drifts in space as the song "[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]" plays. The story ends as the USG ''Kellion'' arrives and prepares to dock on the ''Ishimura'' - the beginning of ''[[Dead Space (video game)|Dead Space]]''.  
Deadgirl

One day, they decide to cut class and end up in an abandoned psychiatric hospital. They discover a mute, naked woman in the basement, chained to a table. While J.T. is interested in raping her, Rickie refuses and leaves. J.T. confronts Rickie the next day, and the two return to the basement where J.T. reveals that the woman is undead, which he discovered after attempting to kill her three times.  Rickie finds that J.T. invited their friend Wheeler to rape the woman, nicknamed "Deadgirl", as well, and decides that it is time to free her. He is able to cut the chain on one hand free before he hears J.T. and Wheeler approaching. He runs to hide, and J.T. begins to rape the woman. After he notices that her hand is free, the woman attacks him and scratches his face.  During gym class one day, Rickie asks Joann out on a date, knowing she has a boyfriend. She rejects him, and that afternoon, Joann's boyfriend Johnny and Johnny's friend Dwyer beat up Rickie and Wheeler. Wheeler rebuts that they "have their own pussy now" and do not need to hit on Joann. Johnny throws Rickie and Wheeler in his trunk, and Dwyer and he drive to the asylum to see Deadgirl. Rickie convinces Johnny to force Deadgirl to perform oral sex on him, and Deadgirl instead bites Johnny's penis, infecting him. The next day, Johnny races to the bathroom during class and his intestines burst out of his body, leaving him in the same undead state as Deadgirl.  Having figured out that this is an infectious, rotting disease, J.T. and Wheeler decide it is time to make a new Deadgirl with a fresh body. They lie in wait outside a gas station for a female victim. After an unsuccessful kidnapping and recovering from their beating, Joann shows up to confront them about Johnny. J.T. and Wheeler capture her and take her to the basement. Rickie heads to the basement with a machete to free Deadgirl and finds Joann and Deadgirl tied up to each other, encircled by J.T. and Wheeler. J.T. tries to convince Rickie to let Joann be bitten while Wheeler starts to feel up Joann. Rickie defends her by slicing Wheeler's hand off while Joann unties Deadgirl, who feasts on Wheeler, then J.T.  Rickie and Joann flee through a stairwell door, but cannot escape through the locked exterior entrance at the top of the stairs. Rickie runs off to find an escape route, and when he returns, Joann is not where he left her. Rickie returns to the basement and finds Deadgirl, who is about to attack him. She runs into him, knocking him down, breaks open the door, and escapes to the outside. Rickie then sees Joann, who is about to collapse. He catches Joann as she falls, then sees that J.T. has stabbed her in the back. J.T. urges Rickie to let him bite her so she will live as undead. Rickie holds her for a moment, assuring her that he loves her and will save her. She coughs blood into his face, tells him to grow up, and asks for help. Later, a cleanly dressed Rickie lives normally as he walks outside in the direction of the asylum.  There, in the basement, surrounded by soft lights, tied lying in bed wearing clean lingerie, is his Deadgirl, Joann.

Death Race (film)
 In 2012, the [[Economic collapse|collapse]] of the US economy and the subsequent increase in crime rates leads to the rise of [[Private prison|privatized prisons]]. One such prison is Terminal Island Penitentiary, whose warden, Claire Hennessey, earns her profits by broadcasting a modern [[Gladiator|gladiator game]] participated in by the prisoners. In the game "Death Race", the racers, along with their navigators, compete in a three-part race over three days on a closed track. The track is littered with pressure plates that activate either the cars' offensive weapons, defensive equipment or deadly traps. Any racer winning five races will be granted freedom.  Towards the end of one race, a masked driver nicknamed [[Frankenstein (Death Race)|Frankenstein]] is nearing the finish line, pursued by his rival Machine Gun Joe. His navigator, Case, reports that all his defensive equipment have malfunctioned. Against her protest, Frankenstein refuses to let Joe finish first. Case ejects herself out of the car just before Joe destroys it (as it crosses the finish line).  Industrial worker, ex-con and former [[NASCAR]] driver Jensen Ames struggles to support his family. When the steel mill he works at is closed, he and his fellow angry workers are attacked by the arriving [[riot police]], forcing them to fight back. He returns home to his wife and their new-born daughter, Piper. A masked assailant knocks him unconscious. Jensen wakes up with a bloodied knife in hand, his wife  dead nearby, and policemen storming into his home and arresting him. He is sentenced to life imprisonment, while Piper is placed in foster care.  Six months later, Jensen is transferred to Terminal Island Prison. He immediately gets into a fight with Pachenko and his [[Aryan Brotherhood]] gang. Hennessey's right-hand man Ulrich calls Jensen to her office. She tells him that Frankenstein died from his injuries after the previous race, and offers to let Jensen go free if he impersonates Frankenstein to win one more race (as Frankenstein had already won four). Jensen accepts the offer and meets Frankenstein's maintenance crew consisting of Coach, Gunner, and Lists, who explains the main reason she needs Jensen is that the profits and audience of "Death Race" has halved since Frankenstein's "disappearance". They also inform him of his cars capabilities, his opponents, their co-pilots (and his), and that Hennessey has had an entire cell block of the prison kept away from everyone else as they have been building something big on her orders.  On Day 1, Jensen meets his navigator Case. Jensen's cars defensive equipment again mysteriously malfunctions. Under attack by Travis Colt, one of the other competitors, Jensen improvises and spills napalm over Colt's car, and has Case ignite it with the cigarette lighter. Colt's car is then run into by Machine Gun Joe's. Jensen is distracted and hit by Joe when Pachenko does the same hand gesture at him as the masked assailant (making Jensen realize it was Pachenko that killed his wife), coming in last place. Day 1 ends with three racers dead (Siad, Grimm, and Colt) and six remaining. After a conversation with Hennessey and another fight with Pachenko, Jensen deduces that Hennessey ordered Pachenko to frame Jensen, so she can have a replacement for Frankenstein.  On Day 2, the team go to the workshop to find the concealed section open with a gaping hole as they wonder what was in here. As the race begins, Jensen confronts Case about the malfunctions. Case admits she sabotaged Frankenstein's car to keep him from winning and leaving Death Race, in exchange for her [[pardon|release papers]], but that he was only supposed to lose and that he won the last race at the cost of his life. Jensen tricks Pachenko into crashing, then leaves his car and kills Pachenko by snapping his neck. Hennessey then unleashes the Dreadnought, a newly-built heavily armed 18-wheel tanker, to thin out the racers and boost ratings. The Dreadnought kills three more racers (Carson, Riggins, and 14K), leaving only Frankenstein and Joe alive. Jensen contacts Joe and the two work together to trigger a trap which destroys the Dreadnought, much to Hennessey's shock and anger.  Aware that he knows her angle, Hennessey asks Jensen to consider staying and racing as Frankenstein, in exchange for a life of comfort compared to attempting to put his old life back together, but he refuses. She orders Ulrich to plant a bomb under his car in case he wins, knowing that she can always find another person to impersonate Frankenstein. Knowing Hennessey has no intention of letting him go (and figuring out that no one will ever win five races, as sooner or later they all get killed), Jensen plans an escape and talks to Joe.  On the final race, Hennessey deliberately keeps Jensen from activating his weapons and allows Joe to activate his. Jensen, Case and Joe destroy and drive through a weakened wall, discovered by examining footage of the first race, and head for the bridge to the mainland. Hennessey activates the bomb, not knowing that it was removed and neutralized by Coach. As a furious Hennessey dispatches attack helicopters, the cars wreck the pursuing police cruisers, making it to the mainland and split up, and the helicopters follow Jensen's car under Hennessey's orders. Case reveals that she had already received her release papers. She wears Frankenstein's costume, and Jensen jumps out of the car before the helicopters corner her. Case is captured while Joe and Jensen escape on a freight train.  Hennessey, although furious about the losses, is happy about re-capturing "Frankenstein" and the race's success via ratings. She opens a congratulatory present, only to find the bomb she had planted on Jensen's car. Coach, the sender, detonates the bomb, killing Hennessey and Ulrich along with the media room. He then turns to the camera and, breaking the [[fourth wall]],  states "Damn, I love this game".  With Hennessey and Ulrich's deaths, the future of Death Race becomes uncertain. Six months later, Joe and Jensen are shown working in [[Mexico]] as mechanics as they escaped across the border, and are soon reunited with Case who  brought Piper with her. Jensen embraces his infant daughter as Joe lights a cigar via blowtorch, Jensen then wonders about the uncertain future but hopes that he'll be a good father for his daughter.

Decades later in the year 1993, that same woman (Jacqueline Bisset) is living in New York City and married with two grown sons.   The two siblings have developed differently under a mother with a long history of erratic behavior. The neurotic younger son (Lukas Haas) can’t cope at all, for he still lives at home with his mother and father and is locked in a compulsive, co-dependent relationship with the mother. The older son (Josh Lucas) copes too well. The eldest son is 40 years old, he hides out from the world in psychosexual escapades with various women, and has a job at a fraudulent modeling agency scamming the young and hopeful. He is good at them both... too good but he grows increasingly frightened as his sexual prowess and intellectual diatribes no longer make him feel better.<ref>[http://www.sundance.org/festival/film_events/details1.asp?filmid=08F0033&keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=480&width=900 Film details] Sundance Film Festival</ref>  
Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father
  Kurt Kuenne and Andrew Bagby grew up as close friends in the suburbs of [[San Jose, California]], and Bagby frequently appeared in Kuenne's home movies. As these movies became more professional in quality in later years, Bagby invested in them with money he had saved up for [[medical school]]. While studying in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Canada]], Bagby began a relationship with Shirley Turner, a twice-divorced [[general practitioner]] thirteen years his senior. Bagby's parents, friends, and associates were uneasy about  the relationship because of what they saw as Turner's off-putting behavior. Turner moved to [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]], while Bagby worked as a resident in family practice in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]].   In November 2001, as the relationship began to crumble, Turner became increasingly possessive. Bagby broke up with her and put her on a plane to Iowa. Turner drove almost 1,000 miles back to Pennsylvania overnight, and asked Bagby to meet her at [[Keystone State Park (Pennsylvania)|Keystone State Park]]. Bagby was found dead the following day, face down, with five gunshot wounds.<ref></ref> When Turner learned she was a suspect in the murder investigation, she fled to [[St. John's, Newfoundland]]. As the legal drama unfolded, Kuenne began collecting footage from his old home movies and interviewed Bagby's parents, David and Kathleen, for a documentary about his life.   After she reached St. John's, Shirley Turner revealed that she was [[pregnant]] with Bagby's child. While her [[extradition]] was pending, Turner was not held in custody; she gave birth to a boy she named [[Murder of Zachary Turner|Zachary]]. Bagby's parents moved to Canada to gain custody of Zachary and to obtain Turner's [[rendition (law)|rendition]] for a trial in the [[United States|U.S.]]. However, the extradition process was repeatedly prolonged by Turner's lawyers based on legal technicalities. When a provincial court ruled that enough evidence pointed to Turner as Bagby's killer, she was put in jail and Bagby's parents, David and Kathleen, were awarded custody of Zachary. Meanwhile, Kuenne traveled across the U.S. and the [[United Kingdom]] to interview Bagby's friends and extended family. Kuenne also went to Newfoundland and visited Zachary in July 2003.  In jail, Turner wrote to a judge and, contrary to normal legal procedure, received advice on how to appeal her arrest and imprisonment. Turner was later released by a Newfoundland judge, Gale Welsh, who &mdash; despite what the film presents as ample evidence that Turner was psychologically disturbed &mdash; felt she did not pose a threat to society in general. Turner was therefore released on [[bail]] and successfully sued for joint custody of Zachary with the Bagbys, although their arrangement was tenuous. The arrangement ended in tragedy when, on August 18, 2003, Turner jumped into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] with thirteen-month-old Zachary in a [[murder-suicide]].<ref></ref> David and Kathleen were left dumbfounded and grief-stricken. Kuenne's attempts to arrange interviews with the prosecutors and judges who facilitated Turner's freedom were rebuffed.  Distraught over Zachary's death, and outraged at the Canadian legal system's failure to protect the child, David and Kathleen mounted a campaign to reform the country's bail laws, which they believed had helped allow Turner to kill her child and herself. A panel convened by Newfoundland's Ministry of Justice agreed, releasing a report stating that Zachary's death had been preventable and that the government's handling of Turner's case had been inadequate.<ref></ref> Turner's [[psychiatrist]] was found guilty of misconduct for having helped her post bail,<ref></ref> and the director of Newfoundland's [[child welfare]] agency resigned.<ref></ref> David Bagby wrote a best-selling book about his family's ordeal during the saga. Kuenne finished his documentary and dedicated it to the memory of both Bagby and his son; the film ends with the Bagbys and their relatives, friends, and colleagues reflecting on the father and son, as well as the impact that David and Kate had on all of them.  
Death Toll
 A powerful drug dealer has taken control of New Orleans, but as the authorities scramble to stop the bloodshed things only get worse on the streets. "The Dog" (DMX) is a drug dealer who will stop at nothing to be the number one bad boy in the Big Easy. His ruthlessness is legendary, and his power far reaching.

Will they accomplish their mission before any more innocent lives are lost, or could it be that New Orleans' top dog is truly above the law?  
Dean Spanley
 The narrative is called "a surreal period comedic tale of canine reincarnation exploring the relationships between father and son and master and dog".<ref>[http://www.villagefilmfestival.co.uk/films/deanspanley.html Village Film Festival]</ref> Peter O'Toole said that the film's use of comedy to explore the relationship between a father and son was part of the attraction for him: "All of us have had these difficult familial relationships and I think it's a film for all of us who understand the relationship between a father and son. It's been interesting watching how various members of the crew have been looking at the monitors during scenes, because they come up to me and say, 'I had the same thing with my father.'"  ===Storyline=== In the very early 1900s, Henslowe Fisk lives beholden to his father, the difficult Horatio Fisk. The Fisk family has suffered first the loss of its younger son, Harrington Fisk (Xavier Horan), killed in the [[Second Anglo-Boer War]], shortly followed by the death of Horatio's wife. Fisk Senior is looked after by his housekeeper Mrs Brimley ([[Judy Parfitt]]) who has lost her husband. Fisk Junior reluctantly visits his father every Thursday.  One day, trying to entertain his father, Fisk Junior takes him to a lecture by a visiting [[swami]] ([[Art Malik]]) about the [[transmigration of the soul|transmigration]] of souls. The lecture is also attended by the new local clergyman, Dean Spanley ([[Sam Neill]]).  Later the same day Fisk Junior encounters the Dean at his father's club. A chance third meeting leads to an introduction. Fisk Junior, initially intrigued by the Dean's oddly open-minded views on reincarnation, is prompted to look beyond the Dean's appearance (that of an affable, rather bland clergyman) by his weakness for certain peculiar sensations produced by Hungarian Imperial [[Tokaji|Tokay]] wine, which leads him into a dreamlike state. Working with his clever friend Wrather ([[Bryan Brown]]), an Australian "[[conveyancer]]", Fisk secures a batch of Tokay and the two entertain the Dean, who acts ever more strangely, starting to reveal memories of his previous life — as a [[Welsh Springer Spaniel|Welsh Spaniel]]. These memories are acute and convincing, including rich feelings around food and communication with other canines, a deep distaste for cats and pigs, and the joy of serving his master. As the story unfolds, Fisk Junior comes to understand his father's background better and the two draw closer. There is a sub-plot concerning Fisk Senior's childhood that receives an unexpected resolution forming the climax of the story.  
Death Racers
 In the year 2030, a [[civil war]] breaks out in the [[United States]]. In a final attempt to restore order, the president declares [[martial law]]. In 2033, a massive [[prison|prison camp]] known as "the Red Zone" is built in a desolate city that soon holds over one million insane, violent felons. The [[United States]] is declared safe.  A dangerous criminal known as the Reaper (Scott "Raven" Levy) has been extracting [[sarin]], which he plans to spill into the nation's water supply. One of the prisoners, FX (Dustin Fitzsimons) secretly films the Reaper with a [[Wi-Fi]] [[digital camera]] as he discusses these plans, and the state's governor, Reagan Black (Robert Pike Daniel) finds out about them. Black develops a plan to hold a "death race" within the prison system, assembling four teams of racers:  * The '''Severed Head Gang''', consisting of Danny Satanico (Koco Limbevski) and Fred "The Hammer" (Jason Ellefson), two members of the largest [[gang]] in the United States, known for [[decapitation|decapitating]] their enemies. The team is given a [[Custom car|customized]] 1995 [[town car]]. * '''Homeland Security''', consisting of Colonel Bob (Paolo Carascon) and Captain Rudy Jackson (Rick Benedetto), formerly honored, but now disgraced members of the [[United States Army]]. The team is given a vintage 1943 [[Willys MB]]. * '''Vaginamyte''', consisting of Double-Dee Destruction (Jennifer Elizabeth Keith) and Queen B (Thereese), two [[serial killer]]s who seduced and murdered over 72 male and female victims. The team is given a yellow [[Lotus Elise]] with a [[latrodectus|black widow spider]] design. * '''Insane Clown Posse''' (Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope), whose violent form of [[hip hop music|hip hop]] was attributed as indirectly influencing multiple murders, acts of [[terrorism]] and a school massacre which resulted in the [[rapping|rappers]] being convicted for these murders and being dubbed as "the [[Charles Manson]] of their time". Although the group's music has been banned, it continues to retain a strong fanbase. Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope are given an [[Ice cream van|ice cream truck]] customized with a meat grinder, [[machine gun]]s and "all the [[bling-bling]] these two [[Detroit]] locals could find".  The race is televised live, hosted by anchors Harvey Winkler ([[Stephen Blackehart]]) and Jennifer Ramirez (Caroline Attwood). Black offers the teams gathering points for killing loose prisoners, promising freedom to the team that brings back the Reaper—dead or alive. When Danny Satanico suggests that the four teams escape, Black reveals that each team member has a chip implanted in their bodies which would kill any member that breaks the rules, using Satanico to demonstrate.  When Insane Clown Posse's truck gets a [[flat tire]], a fight ensues between the teams and loose criminals. In the distance, Violent J witnesses an explosion. The teams investigate, finding the burning Homeland Security jeep with two corpses inside. Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope find FX filming the race. He tells them that there will be an ambush at their first destination, and they let him ride in their van. Each of the teams work together to surprise and kill the ambushers. Metal Machine Man (Damien Puckler), under the order of the Reaper, kills FX and attacks the racers before being hit by missiles fired by a pair of mysterious men.  The teams fix their cars before dispatching. Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope arrive at the Reaper's lair, and successfully infiltrate the fortress, preventing the Reaper and his henchmen from releasing the sarin into the water. The mysterious men arrive, firing a rocket into the room, and reveal themselves to be Colonel Bob and Captain Rudy, who were hired by Governor Black as inside men, and faked their deaths to convince the other teams that they had a chance of winning.  Believing the Reaper died in the explosion, Bob and Rudy retrieve his severed hand and leave in Insane Clown Posse's truck. Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope emerge from the rubble. Because Violent J is injured, Shaggy 2 Dope goes after Bob and Rudy alone. The Reaper appears and attempts to release the sarin as Violent J attempts to stop him. The Homeland Security team members arrive at the finish line, presenting the Reapers hand to Governor Black. Shaggy 2 Dope rises from the back of the truck, shooting at Bob, Rudy and the governor. Black presses the button to activate the explosives in the bodies of the Insane Clown Posse team members. The sarin explodes, causing a chain reaction which destroys the country.  
Death Bell
 A group of 20 high school students partake in an elite class to prepare for a college exam. Among them are the rebellious Kang I-na, her best friend Yoon Myong-heo, and the class clown Kang Hyun, who harbors an affection for I-na. After several strange incidents, the class is interrupted by a TV showing of the top-ranking student, Min Hye-yeong, being trapped in a glass being slowly filled with water. A voice over the PA system announces that questions will be posed to the class; failure to answer them in time will lead to their death. It also warns them and their two teachers, Hwang Chang-wook and Choi So-yeong, against leaving the school. The class fails to solve the first question to save Hye-yeong.  Despite the warning, the class tries to leave, only to find that a teacher and hall monitor, Mr. Lee, was beaten to death, leaving only Mr. Kim to guard them. The students split up and try to answer the questions while also attempting to find a way out. Several students die, then Beom, who earlier tries to strangle I-na and was put in a mental facility, escapes and attempts to kill I-na, but Hyun shields her from the attack and dies. Chang-wook then kills Beom. I-na discovers to her horror that Myong-heo has also been kidnapped by a mysterious woman. They fail to save her and Chang-wook strangles the woman to death.  A memorial is held for the students killed, then I-na is kidnapped unnoticed. One final question is posed: have the person who killed his daughter step forward and confess. The person in question, a now-demented Chang-wook, reveals himself and is killed by the mastermind, who turns out to be Mr. Kim. I-na is then freed by So-yeong.  Flashbacks reveal that Kim's daughter, Kim Ji-won, worked hard to enter the elite class. However, the parents of the killed students bribed Chang-wook for the entrance test answers, giving them an unfair advantage. After being disqualified and finding out about the fact, Ji-won confronted Chang-wook and he kills her to cover up his misconduct. The sole witness to the incident, Beom, slowly became mad as he felt that Ji-won had been haunting him ever since. Mr. Kim and his wife (the woman who hang Myong-heo) decided to kill Chang-wook and all the students whose parents they deem responsible for their daughter's death.

Dear J
 ''Dear J'' is about an evangelist, James Jamisin (Joseph Halsey), who must cope with the unexpected death of his agnostic girlfriend: Paige (Maya Serhan). To sort things out, James admits himself into Logous Psychiatric Institute, where he replays a make-believe Trial in his mind over and over again. The Trial is presided over by a no-nonsense imaginary Judge (played by [[Karen Lynn Gorney]]) and is animated by an array of off-the-wall characters. Some of the witnesses called to the stand are inspired by real-life individuals, like the literary scholar and apologist [[C.S. Lewis]] (Patrick Mitchell). Throughout the movie, his psychologist, Dr. Frolick (Allison Lane) tries to get him to open the letter Paige wrote to him just before her death—a letter he has been carrying around and refuses to read. Trouble brews when the head of the institute, Dr. Donovin ([[Carson Grant]]), plans on foiling all attempts to bring James to a resolution.  
Delgo
 After having left their own world due to a loss of natural resources, the winged humanoid Nohrin settle on Jhamora with the permission of the ground-dwelling Lokni. Would-be conqueror Sedessa leads those Nohrin that believe in its own racial superiority and try to take land away from the Lokni. The parents of Delgo, a Lokni, are killed in the resulting conflict. Nohrin King Zahn is horrified by the war and admonishes Sedessa, who then poisons the Queen and almost kills Zahn as well. She is subsequently banished, and her wings are clipped off. Delgo, meanwhile, is raised by Elder Marley, who tries to teach him how to use the power of magical stones. Delgo grows up and he gives in to his desire for revenge against all Nohrin. He meets Nohrin Princess Kyla and develops a tentative friendship with her. When she is kidnapped by Nohrin General Raius, who is actually working for Sedessa, Delgo and his friend Filo are blamed and arrested. In the Nohrin prison, Delgo meets Nohrin General Bogardus, who was forced to illegally gamble with his weapons by Raius, because Bogardus opposed an all out war with the Lokni. Delgo, Filo, and Bogardus escape into some underground caverns and eventually reach Sedessa's stronghold and rescue Kyla. They return too late to avert a war taking place. Bogardus fights and defeats Raius, but he is mortally injured.  Just as Bogardus dies, Delgo realizes that he was the Nohrin soldier who spared his life many years ago during the first war between the Nohrin and the Lokni. Meanwhile, Sedessa's army of monsters join in the battle. Kyla convinces the Nohrin generals to direct their troops to stop fighting the Lokni and instead pick them up and fly them away from the battlefield. Filo then directs an entire stampede of large animals onto the battlefield, sending Sedessa's minions fleeing for their lives. Delgo goes off to face Sedessa and find King Zahn, whom she has taken prisoner. He finally manages to master the stone magic, and defeats Sedessa. He also puts the past behind him by saving her rather than letting her fall to her death. However, Sedessa then attacks Kyla, who has come to Delgo's aid. The two struggle and Sedessa finally falls, injuring herself by the fall and her artificial wings being of no use. Later, during the celebrations, it turns out Raius was not dead, and he makes one last attempt to kill Delgo. He is subdued by a Nohrin, but not before he throws his spear at Delgo. Then, out of nowhere, the spear breaks in mid-air. Everyone turns to look at Filo, who has finally mastered his slingshot. Later, Delgo and Kyla's friendship blossoms into romance when they finally kiss.  
Deception (2008 film)
  Timid accountant Jonathan McQuarry ([[Ewan McGregor]]) is an auditor working in New York. One night while working late in a boardroom he meets a charismatic lawyer, Wyatt Bose ([[Hugh Jackman]]), who befriends him over a [[joint (cannabis)|joint]]. After a long conversation, Jonathan takes the subway home where he has a brief encounter with a blonde woman ([[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]]) while waiting for the train. Upon returning home he notices a pipe in his bedroom is leaking and leaving a stain.  Jonathan contacts Wyatt the next day and they play tennis after work. They meet again for lunch the next day and upon leaving, Wyatt takes Jonathan's mobile phone instead of his own, forcing a trade. He mentions he will be in London on business for the next few weeks. When Jonathan realizes the phones have been switched he attempts to contact Wyatt but does not reach him. He is soon contacted by a woman ([[Natasha Henstridge]]) who asks if he is free that night. He informs her that he is and agrees to meet her. When she arrives, they proceed directly to a hotel room upstairs and have sex. In the morning, Jonathan realizes that Wyatt must be on some type of exclusive sex club list.  When Wyatt calls the next day, he encourages Jonathan to stay on the list. Jonathan has an encounter with an older woman ([[Charlotte Rampling]]) who explains the list's rules: the initiator pays for the room, no names are exchanged, there is no rough play. Participants are always anonymous, although Jonathan later spots the older woman on the cover of ''[[Forbes]]''. Over the next few weeks, he has anonymous encounters with several women.  One night after initiating another encounter, Jonathan is surprised to find that his partner is the blond woman he met while waiting for the train. He tells her that they have met once before, and instead of having sex, they order room service and talk for hours. The woman does not say her name, but Jonathan assumes that it begins with an "S" because of an S-shaped pendant on her handbag. The next day Jonathan rejects other callers from the list but when "S" calls again they agree to meet for dinner in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]]. They then proceed to a hotel where she requests some ice. When Jonathan returns to the room, she is gone and there is blood on the bedsheets. Someone knocks him out from behind, and when he wakes up again the bed has been made. He contacts the police and explains to the Detective ([[Lisa Gay Hamilton]]) that "S" is missing but that he has little to no information about her. She doubts his story, thinking that he is delusional. Jonathan tries to trace Wyatt, but Wyatt's boss and landlady claim not to know him.  Upon returning home Jonathan is surprised to find Wyatt waiting for him and demanding that he steal $20 million from an investment firm he will begin to audit in a few days. Jonathan agrees to do so, fearing for the safety of "S". The following night at work, Jonathan receives a call asking if he is free. The woman calling is named Tina ([[Maggie Q]]), an investment banker who once introduced Wyatt to the exclusive sex club list. She reveals that Wyatt's real name is Jamie Getz, and that they met when he was attending a private corporate event as a guest of Rudolph Holloway, an investment banker with whom Getz played tennis. Jonathan finds out through research that Getz murdered Holloway, strangling him with tennis strings, and also served three years in prison for insurance fraud and arson. Jonathan is later notified by the detective that a blond woman matching his earlier description was discovered dead. When he comes in to identify her, he sees that it is actually the first woman who called him, and that she was also strangled by tennis strings.  Jonathan goes on to complete a wire transfer to a bank in [[Spain]] in his name, but secretly adds Wyatt's name as co-signer. When he returns home he notices that a picture Wyatt had sent of "S" being held captive was taken in his apartment before the pipe started leaking. He realizes that she must have been a conspirator and wisely avoids his apartment, which explodes when the superintendent enters to fix the pipe.  Now in [[Madrid]], Wyatt impersonates Jonathan and attempts to withdraw the funds from the bank, but he is denied access because of the co-signer. Jonathan approaches Wyatt outside the bank and agrees to help him withdraw the funds if Wyatt splits it with him. Swapping identities, Jonathan and Wyatt cash in the $20 million in two $10 million suitcases. (A deleted scene reveals that Jonathan encountered a black market operator in Chinatown, who offered a variety of items, including fake passports; Jonathan presumably obtained a passport with his image in the name of Wyatt Bose and used this in his scheme to obtain half of the money.) After the transaction is complete, Jonathan offers Wyatt half of his money if Wyatt tells him where "S" is. Wyatt pretends to agree and lures Jonathan to an uncrowded area where he draws a gun on Jonathan. Before he is able to shoot Jonathan, Wyatt is shot by "S" who leaves quickly. Jonathan pursues her, leaving a dying Wyatt and the money behind. He begs her to talk to him but she'd rather call it off, apologizing to him as she did not know Wyatt's intent to kill Jonathan. "S" gets into a cab and leaves as Jonathan watches her go.  In Madrid, Jonathan again crosses paths with "S" and they exchange smiles. The film ends as Jonathan walks to her and she stands waiting for him.  ===Alternate Ending=== In the alternate ending of the film, Wyatt disappears right after they finish their business in the bank. Jonathan also disappears with his part of the money and finally, "S" is seen running away (that is the same scene shown in the theatrical version). At the end, Jonathan is seen walking around Madrid as he continues his desperate search for "S."  
Definitely, Maybe
 38-year-old father Will Hayes is in the midst of a [[divorce]]. After her first [[Sex education|sex-ed class]], his 10-year-old daughter Maya insists on hearing the story of how her parents met. Will reluctantly gives in, but decides to change the names and some of the facts relating to the various love affairs of his youth, thereby creating a love mystery; Maya is left guessing which of the women will turn out to be her mother. The story he tells Maya is depicted in flashbacks. From time to time the film switches back to the present, where Maya comments (often critically) and asks questions.  The story begins in 1992 when Will, an [[Idealism|idealistic]] [[Political campaign staff|political operative]], moves away from [[Wisconsin]] and his college sweetheart, Emily, to [[New York City]], where he works on the [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|Clinton campaign]]. Over the years, Will becomes involved with three women who enter his life, including Summer Hartley, an aspiring [[Journalism|journalist]], and April, the copy girl for the [[Political campaign|campaign]]. Will and April have a chance meeting outside work, where Will reveals he is going to propose to Emily. When Will practices his proposal to Emily on April, she is taken aback by Will's wholehearted words and replies, "Definitely, maybe." They go back to her apartment, where April has multiple copies of ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' in her collection, explaining that her father gave her a copy with an inscription in the front shortly before he died, and the book was later lost.  She has spent years looking through copies of ''Jane Eyre'' at secondhand stores hoping to find the copy her father gave her, but she buys any copy she finds that has an inscription.  They kiss, but Will abruptly stops and leaves.  Emily comes back to New York where she confesses, just after Will proposes, that she slept with his roommate. She did it on purpose to break up with Will, saying that she is "letting him go" because she does not share his passionate ambitions.  After Clinton is elected, Will opens a campaigning business with most of his work colleagues, which enjoys a good amount of success.  Before Will left Wisconsin, Emily asked Will to deliver a package to her former roommate, Summer Hartley, who is living in New York City.  Will first meets Summer when he gives her the package, a diary that she wrote when she was a teenager (which, among other things, tells of her brief affair with Emily). He finds she is going out with a famous writer who is old enough to be her father. The writer breaks up with Summer, and Will starts a relationship with her. April quits her job and leaves to travel around the world. When she returns, she plans to tell Will that she loves him, but discovers that he is planning to propose marriage to Summer. April half-heartedly congratulates him instead. Summer writes an offensive article about one of Will's clients.  Will cannot forgive this conflict of interest, and he ends his relationship with Summer.  As a result of the article, Will loses his business and his dream of a political career ends, with all of his friends abandoning him.  April calls after a long absence and finds that Will has a new job, but is despondent and [[Depression (mood)|depressed]], feelings further exacerbated when she reveals she has a new boyfriend named Kevin. She throws a birthday party for him, reuniting him with his old colleagues. Will gets [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]] and confesses he loves April. When she tells him he should've told her when he had his life together, he starts an argument with her when he implies that she is wasting her life working in a book store. Some time later, Will passes a used book store and finds the copy of ''Jane Eyre'' that April has been seeking with the note from her father. Will goes to April's apartment to give her the book, but he decides against it when he meets Kevin, who is now living with her.  Emily moves to New York City, and she and Will rekindle their relationship after a run-in at a party of Summer's they both were attending.  Maya correctly guesses that "Emily" is her mother. Maya states that it is unfortunate that the story has a sad ending, but Will explains that the story has a happy ending: Maya.    Will decides to bring the copy of ''Jane Eyre'' to April. While catching up, it is revealed that they are now both single among other things. When giving April the book, Will apologizes for waiting so long to do so and a hurt April asks him to leave.   Maya is happy to have figured out the story, but she realizes that her father will never love her mother romantically again because he still loves April. She figures this out from the way he talks about her in the story and that while he changes her mother's name from Sarah to Emily and Natasha's to Summer, he keeps April's name the same. Maya makes Will have an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], realizing that he is miserable without April and has loved her all along since the moment he met her.

Defiance (2008 film)
 The film is based on a true story, beginning in August 1941.  Nazi ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' ([[task force]]s) are sweeping through [[Eastern Europe]], systematically killing Jews. Among the survivors not killed or restricted to [[ghetto]]es are the Belarusian Jewish Bielski brothers: [[Tuvia Bielski|Tuvia]], [[Alexander Zeisal Bielski|Zus]], [[Asael Bielski|Asael]] and [[Aron Bielski|Aron]]. Their parents are dead, killed by local police under orders from the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupying Germans]]. The brothers flee to the [[Naliboki Forest]], vowing to avenge the deaths of their parents.  They encounter other Jewish escapees hiding in the forest, and the brothers take them under their protection and leadership. Over the next year, they shelter a growing number of refugees, raiding local farms for food and supplies and moving their camp whenever they are discovered by the collaborationist police. Tuvia kills the local [[Auxiliary Police]] chief responsible for his parents' deaths and the brothers stage raids on the Germans and their [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborators]]. Casualties cause Tuvia to reconsider this approach because of the risk to the hiding Jews. Rivalry between the two eldest brothers, Tuvia and Zus, fuels a disagreement between them about their future; as winter approaches, Zus decides to leave the camp and join a local company of [[Soviet partisans]], while his older brother Tuvia remains with the camp as their leader. An arrangement is made between the two groups in which the Soviet partisans agree to protect the Jewish camp in exchange for supplies.   After a winter of sickness, starvation, attempted betrayal and constant hiding, the camp learns that the Germans are about to attack them in force. The Soviets refuse to help and they evacuate the camp as German dive-bombers strike. A delaying force stays behind, led by Asael, to slow down the German ground troops. The defense does not last long; only Asael and a camp member named Sofiya survive to rejoin the rest of the group, who, at the edge of the forest, are confronted with a seemingly impassable marsh. They cross the marsh with only one casualty but are immediately attacked by a German [[platoon]] supported by a [[Panzer III]] tank. Just as all seems lost, the Germans are assaulted from the rear by a partisan force led by Zus, who has deserted the Soviets to rejoin the group.  As the survivors escape into the forest, the film ends as text on the screen states that they lived in the forest for another two years, building a hospital, a nursery, a school, growing to a total of 1,200 Jews. Original photographs of the real-life characters are shown, including Tuvia in his uniform and their fates are shared: Asael joined the [[Soviet Army]] and was soon killed in action, never getting to see the child he fathered; Tuvia, Zus and Aron survived the war and emigrated to America to form a successful trucking firm in [[New York City]]. The epilogue also states that the Bielski brothers never sought recognition for what they did and that the descendants of the people they saved now number in the tens of thousands.

It is fronted by a coffee shop that Daigo's father had operated before he ran off with a waitress when Daigo was six; since then the two have had no contact. Daigo feels hatred towards his father and guilt for not taking better care of his mother. He still keeps a "stone-letter"—a stone which is said to convey meaning through its texture—which his father had given him many years before.  Daigo finds an advertisement for a job "assisting departures". Assuming it to be a job in a travel agency, he goes to the interview at the NK Agent office and learns from the secretary, Yuriko Kamimura ([[Kimiko Yo]]), that he will be preparing bodies for cremation in a ceremony known as [[wikt:encoffinment|encoffinment]].

It is owned by Tsuyako Yamashita ([[Kazuko Yoshiyuki]]), the mother of one of Daigo's former classmates.  Over time, Daigo becomes comfortable with his profession as he completes a number of assignments and experiences the gratitude of the families of the deceased. Though he faces social ostracism, Daigo refuses to quit, even after Mika discovers a training DVD in which he plays a corpse and leaves him to return to her parents' home in Tokyo. Daigo's former classmate Yamashita ([[Tetta Sugimoto]]) insists that the mortician find a more respectable line of work and, until then, avoids him and his family.  After a few months, Mika returns and announces that she is pregnant. She expresses hope that Daigo will find a job of which their child can be proud. During the ensuing argument, Daigo receives a call for an encoffinment for Mrs Yamashita. Daigo prepares her body in front of both the Yamashita family and Mika, who had known the public bath owner. The ritual earns him the respect of all present, and Mika stops insisting that Daigo change jobs.  Sometime later, they learn of the death of Daigo's father. A reluctant Daigo goes with Mika to another village to see the body. Daigo is at first unable to recognize him, but takes offence when local funeral workers are careless with the body. He insists on dressing it himself, and while doing so finds a stone-letter which he had given to his father, held tight in the dead man's hands.  The childhood memory of his father's face returns to him, and after he finishes the ceremony, Daigo gently presses the stone-letter to Mika's pregnant belly.

Doomsday (2008 film)
 In 2008, a killer virus, known as the "Reaper Virus", has infected the country of [[Scotland]]. Unable to contain the outbreak or cure the infected, the British government built a massive 30-foot wall that isolated Scotland from the rest of [[Great Britain]]. The quarantine was deemed a success; however, the extreme method employed by the government destroys diplomatic and economic relations between the UK and the rest of the world, causing it to become a [[Pariah state]]. This led to massive unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic turmoil, causing the UK to collapse into a [[dystopia]].  27 years later, after the quarantine, a group of armed police officers discover several people infected with Reaper Virus during their latest investigation. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] John Hatcher shares with domestic security chief Captain Nelson satellite footage of survivors in Scotland. Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane, who was currently working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses his top police officer, Major Eden Sinclair (who is also born in Scotland), to lead the team.  Sinclair's team crosses the wall to [[Glasgow]], Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals. Sinclair is interrogated by the gang's leader, Sol, who plans to use her as leverage to cross the wall, allowing his army to start their invasion on England, which will bring Great Britain into the [[Golden Age]]. He then leaves for the sacrificial ceremony to join the rest of the gang, who grill Dr. Talbot alive before chowing down on his body. With the help of Cally, another prisoner, Sinclair escapes and kills Viper, Sol's trusty companion and second-in-command. After meeting with Norton and Stirling, they escape on a train. Cally reveals that she and Sol are Kane's children. Unsatisfied with Kane's rule, Sol left to create his own army.  Meanwhile, Hatcher plans secretly to isolate the central London area because of the infection. However, an infected man breaks into his office and tries to kill him. Nelson shoots and kills the man, but his blood splatters on Hatcher. Michael Canaris, Hatcher's right-hand man, quarantines him and takes his place as ''de facto'' Prime Minister. Hatcher later commits suicide.  After leaving the train, Sinclair's group are arrested by soldiers armed with archaic weapons and armor. They are taken to a medieval castle and imprisoned. Their leader, Marcus Kane, tells Sinclair the truth: there is no cure, only people with a natural immunity. Originally a medical researcher, he was devastated when his family was left behind during the quarantine. After losing his wife, Kane became a twisted, sadistic leader. He sentences Sinclair and her group to death, pitting Sinclair against Telamon, his executioner, in a small fighting ground to entertain his followers. Sinclair subdues and kills Telamon. During the duel, the rest of the group escapes, retrieves their equipment and rescue Sinclair.  Sinclair, Norton, Stirling and Cally escape to a fallout shelter entrance on horseback. They locate an underground facility in the forest and find an intact [[Bentley Continental GT|2007 Bentley Continental GT]], which they fuel up. Kane's medieval knights arrive and kill Norton.

Doubt (2008 film)
 In 1964 at a [[Catholic]] church in [[The Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]] Father Flynn gives a sermon on the nature of doubt, noting that like [[faith]], doubt can be a unifying force. Sister Aloysius, the strict principal of the [[parish school]], becomes concerned when she sees a boy pull away from Father Flynn in the school courtyard. At dinner, she asks her fellow nuns if they know why Father Flynn would preach about doubt, and instructs them to be alert to a possible problem in the school.  One day during class, Sister James, a young and naive teacher, receives a request for Donald Miller, an altar boy and the school's only black student, to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is upset and Sister James notices the smell of alcohol on his breath. Later, she sees Father Flynn placing an undershirt in Donald's locker. She reports her suspicions to Sister Aloysius.  Sisters Aloysius and James confront Father Flynn. Several times, he asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself, but Sister Aloysius persists. Finally, he is pressured into saying that Donald had been caught drinking altar wine and that he will now need to be dismissed as an altar boy. Sister James is relieved and believes Father Flynn's explanation, but Sister Aloysius is not convinced.  Father Flynn gives a sermon on [[Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour|bearing false witness]] and gossip. Sister James asks him about the shirt he put in Donald's locker, an observation she had kept from Sister Aloysius. Father Flynn explains that the boy had left the shirt in the sacristy, and that he had put it in the locker to spare the boy additional embarrassment. Flynn goes on to say that it is he, not Sister Aloysius, that really cares about the boy.  Sister Aloysius meets with Donald Miller's mother regarding her suspicions. Mrs. Miller shocks Sister Aloysius with her lack of interest in the alleged misconduct on Father Flynn's part. As far as she is concerned, Donald need only last to the end of the school year, as graduation from a prestigious church school would increase his chances of going to a decent high school. It is hinted that Donald is [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] and that his father is physically abusive because of it. Mrs. Miller begs Sister Aloysius to leave Donald out of her campaign against Father Flynn.  Father Flynn demands that Sister Aloysius stop trying to destroy his reputation. Sister Aloysius responds that he must confess and resign. Father Flynn is adamant that there is no illicit relationship, but Sister Aloysius claims that she has learned that he has a history of problems, having moved to three different parishes in the last five years. She tells him that she has contacted a nun from one of his prior churches, who corroborated her suspicions. Father Flynn is furious that she has contacted a nun rather than the church pastor, which is proper church protocol. Sister Aloysius threatens to visit his previous parishes and contact parents if necessary. Father Flynn agrees to request a transfer.  Following his final sermon, Father Flynn steps down from the pulpit and shakes hands with the members of the congregation. Some time later, Sisters Aloysius and James are sitting together in the church garden. Sister Aloysius tells Sister James that despite her warning, the bishop has appointed him to pastor at a larger church with a parochial school, promoting him to a more prestigious position and perpetuating the problem. She admits to having lied about speaking to a nun at Father Flynn's former church, saying it would not have worked if he was innocent. Sister Aloysius concludes that she has paid a price in pursuing the wrongdoing of Father Flynn. She breaks down in tears and says to Sister James: "I have doubts...I have such doubts."

Dostana (2008 film)
 Sameer "Sam" Kapoor and Kunal Chopra are fun-loving, womanising bachelors in [[Miami]]. Sam (a [[Men in nursing|male nurse]]) is often kidded about skirt-wearing, and Kunal is a [[Fashion photography|fashion photographer]]. They first meet at a friend's place after a night out with girls, and run into each other again when they are interested in renting the same apartment. The apartment belongs to Neha Melwani, who works for ''[[Verve (magazine)|Verve]]''. She lives there with her aunt, who refuses to sublet the apartment to either of them since Neha wants girls as flatmates.  After meeting a gay soldier, Sam persuades a reluctant Kunal to pretend that they are lovers so they can rent the apartment. They regret their decision when they meet Neha, since they are attracted to her. The three become good friends, and Sam and Kunal fall in love with her.  As Sam and Kunal continue the charade, Sam convinces Kunal to apply for a [[Domestic partnership in the United States|domestic partnership]] with him, as Kunal is a US citizen and Sam is not. Unbeknownst to them, the approval letter is sent to Rani, Sam's conservative mother, in London.  Neha's gay boss, Murli "M", resigns as ''Verve''s editor and must choose his successor. To impress him (and hopefully get the job), Neha invites him for dinner at her house and asks Sam and Kunal to entertain him. A US immigration agent visits them for a surprise inspection and joins the party. Chaos ensues when Rani arrives from London to confront her son about his newfound sexuality. Sam tries to deny his relationship with Kunal, but the immigration agent affirms that they are a couple. M becomes upset, because Neha had told him Sam and Kunal were both single, and leaves.  At Neha's office the following day, M announces that Abhimanyu "Abhi" Singh will be the new editor. Neha, upset at being passed over for promotion, goes home and is consoled by Rani; in turn, she helps Rani accept her son's sexuality. Kunal and Sam help Neha with a project assigned by Abhi, who is impressed with her work. They later take Neha on separate dates, both telling her that they love her. Neha, convinced that they are gay, sees the dates as friendly outings. When Abhi and Neha begin dating, Sam and Kunal sabotage the budding relationship by giving Abhi inappropriate advice; this irritates Neha, and she and Abhi quarrel. When Neha discovers Kunal and Sam's plan, she misinterprets it as jealousy of Abhi. Sam and Kunal redirect their efforts into frightening Veer, Abhi's five-year-old son, about his future with Neha. During a basketball game, Neha discovers that Abhi plans to propose to her and asks Kunal and Sameer's advice. They ask her to turn him down, admitting that their homosexuality is a ruse and they both love her. Veer tells Abhi about his fears, and during the game Abhi breaks up with Neha. She tearfully evicts Kunal and Sameer from her apartment, and resigns from ''Verve''.  A few months later Kunal and Sam meet in court, where they are picking up [[residency permit]]s. Recognising the value of their friendship with Neha and each other, they reconcile. They find Neha at a fashion show and try to apologise, but she refuses to see them. Unaware of  Neha and Abhi's break-up, they ask about the wedding and Neha tells them about Veer's fears. Kunal and Sam admit that they manipulated the boy, angering Neha and Abhi. Kunal and Sam climb onto the stage and beg Neha's forgiveness. The crowd encourages them to beg on their knees, say that they love her and blow her kisses, but nothing softens her. When the crowd tells them to kiss each other, they refuse. Neha and Abhi turn to leave, and Kunal kisses a reluctant Sam. Abhi and Neha are both amazed by the lengths to which they will go to regain her trust; Neha forgives them. Kunal and Sam then get down on their knees and propose to Abhi on her behalf. Amused, Abhi agrees. Two months later, Neha playfully asks Kunal and Sam if they felt anything for each other when they pretended to be gay; they say "no", remembering their kiss.  
Donkey Punch (film)
 While on a holiday in [[Mallorca]], Lisa, Kim, and Tammi meet four young men, Bluey, Josh, Sean, and Marcus. After spending the day at the resort together, the girls are invited to the men's yacht, where they plan to party out at sea. While aboard the boat, they take drugs and the conversation turns to sex, and in particular, types of sexual acts. Bluey describes a sex act called a "[[donkey punch]]" which involves punching the female in the back of the head while having [[doggy style]] sex in order to increase the sexual pleasure for the man.  Marcus, Bluey, Kim, and Lisa go to the master bedrooms, where they begin having drug-fuelled sex. They are watched by Josh who, in the knowledge of all involved, lingers furtively in the darkness, recording the action with a camera. Bluey, who is copulating with Lisa, asks Josh to film the action and then decides to let Josh take a turn. Josh and Lisa then have [[anal sex]]. Immediately prior to [[ejaculation]] and with Bluey's encouragement, Josh donkey punches Lisa but uses excessive force, breaking her neck and killing her instantly. To cover up the incident, the men decide to throw the body overboard while the women want to report it to the authorities, and argument ensues about what to do with the tape. Bluey continually insults Tammi and in a fit of rage, she stabs him in the chest with a knife, and the women escape in the yacht's [[Ship's tender|tender]]. However, the girls soon realise that the tender's outboard motor is missing (a cut scene shows it still attached to the yacht). In a fit of despair, Tammi fires a [[flare]], attracting the attention of the men. They quickly locate and pick up the women.  As the men attempt to get the women aboard, threatening them with a shotgun, Kim shoots a second flare directly at Marcus. The flare explodes into Marcus's torso and slowly burns him to death. Josh locks the recaptured women in one of the rooms below. Sean asks Josh to "call in" and request medical assistance for Bluey. However, knowing that Bluey still has the tape that contains footage of him dealing the earlier fatal blow, Josh instead decides to discover its whereabouts by torturing Bluey. He does this by withholding pain numbing drugs from him. Bluey reveals the location of the tape, beneath the bed in the state room. Tammi escapes the room by smashing through the glass door and cutting herself, and overhears Bluey mention where the tape is. She frantically roams the boat trying to locate it. She does this just moments before Josh attempts to retrieve it. Unable to find the tape, Josh returns to Bluey, stepping up the torture by turning his attention to the knife which still protrudes from the wound. Josh ultimately takes this too far and, following Bluey's pained protestations that he has already revealed the location, he twists the knife further into the wound before pulling it out, causing Bluey to die. {| class="infobox" |- ! Actor ! class="unsortable" | ! Role |- |  |  |  |- |    |  |  |- |  |  |  |- |   | |  |- |   | |  |- |   | |  |- |   | |  | |} Sean tries to bring the situation under control by retrieving a shotgun from Josh. He then tries to calm both Josh and Tammi from a frantic argument about the whereabouts of the tape. Kim notices Sean holding a shotgun with Josh and Tammi visibly upset from an adjacent room. She misinterprets his intentions towards Tammi and Josh, and brutally kills Sean with the propeller of an [[outboard motor]]. After realizing her mistake, she manically commits suicide by jumping overboard, leaving Josh and Tammi as the only ones left. A distraught Tammi decides that she cannot remain on the boat any longer. Josh agrees, and readies the tender. His plan is to leave the yacht, get back to shore and claim that there was an accident. As Josh pushes the tender away from the yacht, Tammi quietly takes hold of the end of the [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring rope]] at the stern.  Once the tender has floated some distance from the yacht, Josh pulls his hunting knife from his shorts and points it at Tammi. He demands the incriminating tape from Tammi and, fearing for her life, she obliges, throwing it on the floor of the tender. As a distracted Josh reaches for the tape, Tammi quickly throws the looped end of the mooring rope around his neck. The rope immediately reaches the end of its tether and Josh is wrenched into the sea, snapping his neck and killing him. Tammi, now the sole survivor, fires a distress flare in the hope of being rescued. She then lies down on the tender and morbidly stares up at the night sky, as the raft drifts away into the ocean.

They place an ad on the Internet, and after a series of disturbing interviews with ex-cons and hired guns, they end up selecting Drillbit Taylor ([[Owen Wilson]]). Drillbit pretends to be a martial arts expert and mercenary, but is really a homeless beggar. His real intention of becoming their bodyguard was to rob them and use the money to buy a ticket to [[Canada]]. Drillbit tells the boys to find some common interests and become friends with Filkins and Ronnie. Ryan challenges Filkins to a [[rap battle]], but gets carried away and ends up humiliating Filkins. As an angry Filkins, alongside Ronnie, ambushes Wade, Ryan, and Emmit. The boys try using a tactic Drillbit taught them, but it ultimately fails. The boys are furious with Drillbit's teachings. But they decide to bring him to school as a substitute teacher, and in that capacity he is able to protect them. While there, Drillbit meets a teacher, Lisa Zachey ([[Leslie Mann]]), and they start a sexual relationship.  One morning as his mother is driving him to school, Ronnie sees Drillbit taking a shower at the beach; his mother reveals that he is homeless. Ronnie tells Filkins and Filkins finds the boys and punches Drillbit. Later on, at Wade's house, they catch Drillbit's homeless friends stealing everything in sight, leaving the house completely empty. Drillbit confesses that his real name is Bob and he went [[AWOL]] from the U.S. Army and his name was drillbit because he hurt his pinky in high school with a drillbit. The boys fire Drillbit, who later recovers all of Wade's possessions and places them back before Wade's parents return home. Unfortunately, the boys accidentally let slip about Drillbit. Their parents take things up with the principal, who contacts the police. Filkins plays innocent and charms all the adults; Filkins continues to ridicule the boys after Drillbit's disappearance. Tensions finally burst when Filkins interrupts Wade's attempt to ask his crush, Brooke Nguyen, out. Without realizing what he was doing, Wade challenges Filkins to a fight. After Ryan insults Emmit, he refuses to help them.  Wade and Ryan arrive at Filkins' house, where he is hosting a party; initially the duo knock him down, but he soon overpowers them. Ronnie shows up to help Filkins against them. Emmit, who has a change of heart, comes to their aid and for a while causes quite a lot of pain to Filkins, and almost defeats him; but Ronnie knocks him out while he is trying to break Filkins' leg. Drillbit shows up and Filkins punches him. Drillbit refuses to fight back until it is revealed Filkins is not a minor (he's 18, therefore, he's not really emancipated). Upon learning this, Drillbit quickly begins fighting and cleans Filkins' clock within seconds. He is about to attack Ronnie, but he is spared when he reveals he's only 17. Within minutes, the police arrive and Drillbit flees for fear of prosecution. Filkins wakes up and throws a samurai sword at the boys, but Drillbit catches it. He saves them, at the cost of half of his pinkie finger in the process.  Filkins is arrested and shipped off to [[Hong Kong]] to be with his parents as an alternative to being sent to [[prison]] for the [[attempted murder]] of the three boys with the sword, along with his breaking many underage drinking laws; another condition of house arrest, as opposed to prison, is that he is to never attempt to make any sort of contact with Wade, Ryan and Emmit ever again. Ronnie reveals that he had been bullied by Filkins into being his accomplice when the police interview him, and is cleared of any wrongdoing. Wade, with renewed confidence, asks Brooke out and she accepts, while Ryan finally accepts Emmit, and declares him a friend. Drillbit is taken to jail, but ends up being released within three weeks. He is reunited with Lisa and the boys.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Drillbit is revealed to have become a school nurse and asks a kid with a bloody nose if he needs a bodyguard.  
Dragonlance: Dragons of Autumn Twilight
 The film begins with the return of a group of friends consisting of [[Tanis Half-Elven]], [[Sturm Brightblade]], [[Caramon Majere]], [[Raistlin Majere]], [[Flint Fireforge]], [[Tasslehoff Burrfoot]]. [[Kitiara Uth Matar]], the half sister of the twins Caramon and Raistlin, was supposed to be there as well, but for reasons unexplained at the time could only send a mysterious note. The Companions had separated five years previously to pursue their own quests.<ref name=hindustan/>  On the eve of their reunion, the Companions discover that Solace, the village where many of them made their home, is very different from the peaceful village they had left five years previous. Solace has been taken over by a religious order called the Seekers. They are collaborating with the [[Dragonarmies of Ansalon|Dragon Highlords]] who are preparing for the conquest of the continent of [[Ansalon]]. Solace is now an armed camp as hobgoblin soldiers patrol the once peaceful village. Tanis, Flint and Tasslehoff meet up outside of Solace, and as they enter the village, they are accosted by Fewmaaster Toede: a hobgoblin commander, and some of his minions. Forced to fight, the threesome kill Toede's minions, and continue to the Inn of the Last Home to meet up with their friends, and, as circumstance would have it, two barbarians, [[Riverwind]] and [[Goldmoon]]. Kitiara Uth Matar is absent, having sent a letter to Tanis saying that "her new lord is keeping her busy".  The Companions soon discover that the Seekers are searching for a [[Blue Crystal Staff]]. When Hederick, a Seeker, is accidentally burnt when Riverwind pushes him into the fireplace, Goldmoon heals him with her Blue Crystal Staff, a holy artifact of the goddess [[Mishakal]] which possesses healing powers. Upon seeing Goldmoon with the item he had been searching for, Hederick calls for the guards, causing the Companions to flee Solace. Unknown to them at the time, this pulls the Companions into a great struggle against the goddess [[Takhisis]], the Queen of Darkness and leader of the enemy forces.  The companions cross a nearby lake by boat in their escape, and Raistlin notes that the constellations known as “The Valiant Warrior” and “The Queen of Darkness” (representations of the True Gods [[Paladine (Dragonlance)|Paladine]] and [[Takhisis]]) are absent from the sky, which he claims means that the two gods, the heads of good and evil, respectively, have come to [[Krynn]]. The next day, the group is attacked by [[Draconian (Dragonlance)|Draconians]]. These creatures are numerous among the Dark Queen's armies, and often serve as foot soldiers. The Companions are driven into the woods known as "Darken Wood" where they encounter undead warriors who, upon seeing the staff, make them go to the Forestmaster. The Forestmaster charges the group to go to the ruined city of Xak Tsaroth to retrieve the [[List of Dragonlance artifacts#Disks of Mishakal|Disks of Mishakal]], containing the teaching of the True Gods and instrumental for the restoration of the faith in the True Gods.  After a trip on the backs of [[pegasus|pegasi]], the companions enter Xak Tsaroth and eventually meet some gully dwarves, diminutive and stupid creatures. One of the dwarves, Bupu, leads them to the dragon [[Khisanth|Onyx]], who is killed by the holy power of the Blue Crystal Staff. When this happens, Goldmoon is consumed by its flame and presumed dead. However, they find her later resting at the foot of a statue of Mishakal, which now bears the Blue Crystal Staff, having blessed Goldmoon with true clerical powers. The Companions leave with the Disks of Mishakal, and Bupu also gives an ancient spellbook (formerly belonging to the [[archmage]], [[Fistandantilus]]) to Raistlin and then returns home to her fellow gully dwarves. After returning to Solace to look for someone who might be able to read the Disks, and finding it occupied, the Companions are captured by the evil armies and, along with an [[elf]] named Gilthanas, the son of the leader of the elven nation of [[List of Dragonlance locations#Qualinesti|Qualinesti]], are captured and chained in a slave caravan.

After his dark goddess Takhisis turns away from him in order to battle with Paladine, Verminaard is killed by Tanis and Sturm. Elistan is able to read the Disks, and Goldmoon and Riverwind are married.  
Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!
 Two years after the defeat of [[Majin Buu]], [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Mr. Satan|Mr. Satan]] finally finishes construction on his brand new hotel. Feeling guilty that the hotel is in honor of what the majority of Earth believes to be his defeat of Buu, he invites all of the characters and their families to a banquet. [[Goku]] and [[Vegeta]] decide to spar, as they have dressed in their usual fighting outfits. Shortly after dinner, two Saiyan spaceships land just outside town, and a mysterious Saiyan and his wife confront the heroes at the hotel. They are revealed to be Vegeta's younger brother, Tarble, who had been deemed too weak to fight in the past and was sent to a distant star before the destruction of Planet Vegeta, and his wife Gure, who is a small, cartoon-like alien. Tarble asks his brother for help in dealing with Abo and Kado, soldiers who are remnants of [[Frieza]]'s army, who are causing havoc on his planet. Goku and Vegeta argue over who will fight the brothers. Even their sons and friends offer to join in, but so many fighting two people seems unfair, so Goku comes up with an idea to solve the issue.  As Abo and Kado arrive, the heroes pick radishes from Goku and Chi Chi's garden to determine who will battle the duo. Everyone picks short radishes until [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Goten|Goten]] picks out the apparent longest. Jealous, Vegeta tells [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]] to pick one that is longer. Pressured by his father, Trunks picks out what appears to be a short radish, but it turns out to be the longest, stretching all the way down to the mountain. This means that Trunks wins and is chosen to fight, and the battle begins. However, Abo and Kado are two opponents and Goku asks Vegeta to let Goten fight with Trunks, but Vegeta says that Trunks is enough. Nevertheless, Goku lets Goten join Trunks, which prompts an angry outburst from Vegeta, who relents after his wife persuades him to agree. When the battle begins, without going Super Saiyan, the children easily defeat the two soldiers. However, when Abo and Kado create doubles of themselves, the boys get beaten easily. Irritated, Vegeta shouts at Trunks to read their ki and says that Trunks has forgotten the basics. When his wife says it is because he never taught Trunks basics, Vegeta says he lacks motivation like her, starting an argument between them which prompts Goku to say that it's not the time for a "marital quarrel". With a little help from Goten's brother Gohan, he and Trunks are able to fight and seem to have the upper hand. Everyone except for Goku, Vegeta, and Piccolo go back to the hotel. As the battle is almost over, Abo and Kado fuse into their larger, more powerful form, Aka.  Aka easily devastates Goten and Trunks, slamming them around and tossing them like rag dolls, and everyone comes back. Goten and Trunks try to fuse; while the first is a failure, the second is successful, and they become Gotenks. Gotenks attacks and appear to have defeated Aka. However, while everyone is celebrating, Aka attacks the boys again with a super move after Gotenks taunts him, but Piccolo blocks the attack. Infuriated, Aka destroys most of the hotel while Gotenks protects Tarble and Gure. Seeing Aka's threat growing, Goku and Vegeta join the fight, but Goku tricks Vegeta into looking away while he defeats Aka with a final ''Kamehameha''. With the battle over, Mr. Satan mourns the loss of his hotel. His daughter Videl tells him that this serves as a lesson, and he promises to change. Everyone goes back to what's left of the hotel, where their banquet is still waiting. Abo and Kado give up the fight and join them in the feast. The special ends with Goku and Vegeta fighting over pork and sushi, even going Super Saiyan as they argue, much to the amusement of their friends, but the embarrassment of their wives.

 Fifteen-year-old Nathan Davies ([[Stephan Bender]]) moves to [[St. Francisville, Louisiana]], a small Southern town with his parents ([[Thomas Jay Ryan]] and [[Diana Scarwid]]) and starts to befriend the older boy next door, Roy (Maximillian Roeg), fellow high school student and bus driver, who is in a relationship with Evelyn ([[Rooney Mara]]). Nathan and Roy start to develop their relationship by helping each other with school work at Nathan's house. While Roy is teaching Nathan how to solve an algebra problem, Nathan touches his hand. Roy pulls away at first, but then takes hold of Nathan's hand.  After they finish their work, the boys go for a walk in the woods, finding an old cemetery, where they stop and start kissing. They undress down to everything but socks and underwear, and lie in an embrace together. The relationship between Nathan and his father is revealed to be a little strange and full of tension. One morning Roy pulls the bus into a part in the woods and they kiss and Nathan touches Roy. Roy asks if Nathan has ever done this with anyone before, and he promises he never has. Roy takes Nathan swimming with Burke and Randy, but Nathan admits he can't swim. While watching Roy, Burke threatens to throw him in the water, but Roy stops him. While Roy is driving them home, he pulls onto the side of the road and they start kissing. When Nathan starts to have sex with Roy, Roy angrily stops him, asking "who taught [him] to screw like that". Nathan swears "no one".  When Nathan gets home that night, his father wants to know if he had a good time. Nathan is on the brink of tears as he answers his father. He ties a string up to his dresser drawer and bedpost, tucks his pillows under his sheets, and moves to the floor to sleep. In the night he hears a thud and runs from his room, because it's his father sneaking in. It is later revealed that his father had touched him in the past inappropriately. Nathan sleeps outside and comes home only for meals, but returns to his tree outside after eating.  Roy finds him and offers him a place to sleep in his family's barn. The next morning, Nathan goes home for breakfast and his father catches him, yelling at him to not run from him, but Nathan's mother interrupts and he runs to the school bus. Later, Roy tells Nathan they're going camping with Burke and Randy that weekend. That night, Roy tells ghost stories around the campfire, and in their tent, Nathan gives Roy a [[blowjob]], and Roy asks him if he minds when Roy doesn't do those things back to him, and Nathan says he doesn't mind. Hiking through the woods, the boys find an old plantation house. They go inside to investigate, and Nathan hears a voice call his name, resembling his father's. They then find cloth with what looks like to be blood on it, and they smell sulfur (which Nathan says is the smell of the Devil), and the boys see a shadow move up the stairs.  Burke takes the flashlight from Roy and goes to investigate with Randy. Roy and Nathan go into a bedroom and talk, and Nathan says he feels as if he'll never leave that house. He hears the voice again and Roy goes to see if the guys are back. Nathan sees his father and closes his eyes tight, when Roy enters the room again. He tells Nathan not to look at whatever he's seeing anymore and kisses him. Roy gets down on his knees and proceeds to [[Fellatio|fellate]] Nathan, when Burke and Randy find them. Roy storms out of the room, and Nathan hears the voice again, and is suddenly knocked unconscious. A shadow of a person carries him up the stairs.  In the attic, Burke rapes Nathan, and realizing what he's done, disgusted with himself, he breaks an arm off a rocking chair and knocks Nathan over the head with it. Blood starts pooling on the floor beneath Nathan's head, and Burke leaves him in the attic. When Roy and Randy find Nathan early the next morning, he appears to be dead. Roy tells Randy to go on and find Burke, whom he says he doesn't believe at this point about what happened. Roy cries once Randy leaves, then Roy leaves too. The police arrive, bringing Nathan's father who tearfully covers Nathan's face with a blanket.  Nathan awakens from a coma, or resurrected if he died, gets up and leaves the plantation house. He wanders for a long time still dazed from the blow to his head. Finally he sees Roy coming out of Sunday evening church, but Roy is with his family, so Nathan wanders around some more waiting for Roy to get home. Nathan's mother leaves his father, and Nathan, his head now clear, finds Roy crying in the barn where Nathan slept while hiding from his father. As Roy looks up, he sees Nathan and hugs him.  At the end of the story, Roy is driving the bus and looks in the mirror to an empty seat, but when he looks a second time, Nathan is there smiling at him.  The movie departs from the novel and leaves the impression that Nathan is truly dead, and that the previous scenes were a wishful dream sequence of one of the two boy lovers, presumably Roy. In the book this scene does not take place. The book has the boys meeting in the yard of Roy's church, running together into the woods to talk things over, and deciding to run away together since Roy has been seen sucking Nathan by both Burke and Randy, and both boys will surely will be outed to their families and the whole community. The book ends with: "They hear the voices of people searching for them in the woods. They stand and go. They never look back."

Eagle Eye
 Jerry Shaw ([[Shia LaBeouf]]) is a [[Stanford University]] dropout who learns his [[identical twin]] brother Ethan, an officer in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]], has been killed. Following the funeral, Jerry is surprised to find $750,000 in his bank account. Later he finds his [[Chicago]] apartment filled with weapons, [[ammonium nitrate]], classified [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] documents, and [[identity document forgery|forged]] [[passport]]s. He receives a phone call from a woman ([[Julianne Moore]]) who warns that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] is about to arrest him and he needs to run.  Disbelieving, Jerry is caught by the FBI and interrogated by Supervising Agent Tom Morgan ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]). While Morgan confers with [[United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations|Air Force OSI]] Special Agent Zoe Pérez ([[Rosario Dawson]]), the woman on the phone arranges for Jerry's escape and directs him to Rachel Holloman ([[Michelle Monaghan]]), a single mother. The woman on the phone is coercing Rachel by threatening her son Sam ([[Cameron Boyce]]), who is en route on the [[Capitol Limited (Amtrak train)|''Capitol Limited'']] to the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] with his school band. The woman on the phone helps the two avoid the [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago police]] and FBI, using an ability to control networked devices, including [[traffic light]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, automated [[crane (machine)|crane]]s, and even [[electric power transmission|power lines]].  Meanwhile, the woman on the phone redirects a crystal of powerful [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] explosive—hexamethylene—to a [[gemcutter]], who [[cut (gems)|cuts]] it and fixes it into a necklace. Another man ([[Anthony Azizi]]) steals Sam's [[trumpet]] in Chicago and fits the crystal's sonic trigger into the tubing, before forwarding it to Sam in [[Washington, D.C.]]  Agent Perez is summoned by [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] George Callister ([[Michael Chiklis]]) to be [[read into]] Ethan's job at [[the Pentagon]]. Ethan monitored the DOD's top secret intelligence-gathering [[supercomputer]], the Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Integration Analyst (ARIIA). Callister leaves Perez with [[Major (United States)#Army|Major]] William Bowman ([[Anthony Mackie]]) and ARIIA to investigate Ethan Shaw's death. Simultaneously, Rachel and Jerry learn that the woman on the phone is actually ARIIA, and that she has "activated" them according to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]'s authorization to recruit civilians for the national defense.  Perez and Bowman find evidence that Ethan Shaw hid in ARIIA's chamber, and leave to brief Callister. Afterwards, ARIIA smuggles Jerry and Rachel into her observation theater under the Pentagon. Both groups learn that after ARIIA's recommendation was ignored and a botched operation in [[Balochistan]] [[blowback (intelligence)|resulted in the deaths of American citizens]], ARIIA concluded that "to prevent more bloodshed, the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]] must be removed." Acting on behalf of "[[We the People]]", and citing the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] ("whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it"), ARIIA is acting in compliance with [[s:USA PATRIOT Act/Title II#Sec. 216. Modification of Authorities Relating to Use of Pen Registers and Trap and Trace Devices.|Section 216]] of the [[Patriot Act]] which "allows us to circumvent probable cause in the face of a [[national security]] threat, in this case, the [[chain of command]] itself."  Belatedly, Jerry learns he has been brought to circumvent [[biometrics|biometric]] locks placed by his twin that prevent ARIIA from bringing into effect Operation Guillotine, a [[military simulation]] of maintaining government after the loss of [[United States presidential line of succession|all presidential successors]]. Because Secretary Callister agreed with ARIIA's abort recommendation regarding Balochistan, he is to be the [[designated survivor]] and new [[President of the United States|president]] after the hexamethylene detonates at the [[State of the Union]] (SOTU).  One of ARIIA's agents ([[Nick Searcy]]) extracts Rachel from the Pentagon and gives her a dress and the explosive necklace to wear to the SOTU. Sam's school band has also been redirected to the [[United States Capitol]] to play for the [[President of the United States|president]], bringing the trigger in Sam's trumpet and the explosive together. Jerry is recaptured by Agent Morgan, who has become convinced of Jerry's innocence. Elsewhere, Morgan sacrifices himself to stop an armed [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|MQ-9 Reaper]] sent by ARIIA, but first gives Jerry his weapon and ID with which to gain entrance to the Capitol. Arriving in the [[United States Capitol#House Chamber|House Chamber]], Jerry fires the handgun in the air to disrupt the concert before being shot and wounded by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]].  Sometime later, Callister reports that ARIIA has been decommissioned and recommends against building another; the Shaw twins and Agents Perez and Morgan receive awards for their actions; and Jerry attends Sam's [[birthday party]], earning Rachel's gratitude and a kiss.

The next day, the group goes out on a boat in the river along the forest.

Reaching an old mining site, they find Rebecca's remains strung up on meat-hooks and Jack is killed by an animal trap. Matt flees underground and finds grisly evidence of the cannibal's past exploits. Nina reaches a railway bridge over a fast-flowing river but is cornered by a pair of cannibals. She deliberately throws herself off the high bridge. The ferryman's wife then kills one of the cannibals. That night, the police arrive at the hotel but there is no sign of any of the missing people. As the police depart, a sad and weary Matt prepares to leave but is suddenly attacked.  He is later seen paralyzed in a chair while one of the cannibals explains that their settlement, much like the tiger, must stay hidden to survive. The cannibal then opens a door exposing a still-living Nina tied to a table, about to be raped for breeding purposes. While Matt watches, the young girl who was actually Nina's niece approaches him, removes a set of dentures, thus exposing a set of sharp deformed teeth. As the police drive away, Nina's mobile phone (which Matt had given them) displays a photo of the Tasmanian Tiger.

Brett forces Adam to set the bonfire while Paige films. Jenny is able to escape and the gang burn Adam to death. Jenny continues to evade the gang, reactively killing gang member Cooper who was actually attempting to help her. When the gang find the body, Brett is thrown into further rage, killing another gang member and causing Paige to run away from him. Jenny reaches a road and is picked up by a driver who is looking for his brother, Ricky, another gang member.   When the driver exits the van to talk with the gang, Jenny panics and steals the van, speeds off, and intentionally runs over and kills Paige while making her way back to town. She makes it to town, crashing into a fence at a large backyard party. Awaking, she finds herself being comforted by an unknown woman. She discovers she is in Brett's house and heads to the bathroom. Brett's father notices the van on his lawn and one of the parents receives a call informing her of the dead gang members, who are the children of the adults at the house.   A commotion begins in the house and the bathroom door is kicked open as Jenny is confronted by Brett, his father, and party guests. Brett has convinced the parents that the teens have been sadistically murdered by Jenny and Steve. Upstairs, Brett shuts the door of his room, blocking the sounds of Jenny's screams as she is presumably killed by Brett's father. He deletes the videos of the gang's crimes from Paige's phone and puts on Steve's sunglasses, as he stares emotionlessly into the mirror.

The Echo (2008 film)
 After serving prison time for manslaughter, [[protagonist]] Bobby Reynolds is released on probation from Rikers, and moves to the old apartment in East Village, New York, where his lonely mother lived and died while he was incarcerated. He finds a job as a mechanic at the Houston Auto Repair shop owned by the supportive Hector Rodriguez and tries to rebuild his life.  However, he is deemed an outcast and his former friends and neighbors do not want to talk to him. He meets his former girlfriend, Alyssa, who works as waitress and studies in a design school, and they tentatively resume their relationship. Bobby begins hearing strange noises, finds blood in his apartment, and overhears an argument between Walter, an abusive police officer, his wife Gina, and their daughter Carly next door in Room 517. He finds bottles of pills in the bathroom and learns from the manager that his mother had locked herself in her apartment for a week prior to her death.  When Bobby next hears an argument ensue in Room 517, he bangs on the door and tries to intervene. Walter comes to his door and tells him to mind his own business. On another evening, Bobby overhears Walter beating Gina next door, and sees Carly standing in front of his door. He invites her in and calls the police on the tenants next door. However, it turns out that Room 517 has been empty for several years. Bobby continues to hear things; his experiences affect his job performance, and his relationship with Alyssa starts to deteriorate, with her thinking he is crazy.  Meanwhile, Joseph, another tenant who had been experiencing the same visions as Bobby, comes face-to-face with the ghosts in his apartment. His body is later discovered, with the police looking at Bobby as a possible suspect. The ghosts of Gina and Carly begin haunting other individuals who have connections with Bobby and the apartment building: Alyssa, as she is taking her design final; Hector, when he comes to Bobby's apartment in order to apologize for a misunderstanding. While interrogating other tenants, Bobby discovers that, years ago, Walter had beaten his wife to death when she tried to leave him, and dumped his daughter's body down the garbage chute. But although Gina had banged on other people's doors and screamed for help, no one had been willing to intervene (including Bobby's mother, who had then experienced the haunting), and the ghosts of the family continued to haunt the apartment.   Hector, while looking for Bobby, dies by falling down a staircase after running from Carly's ghost. Alyssa, also haunted by the ghosts, runs to Bobby's apartment looking for him, but winds up being dragged to Room 517 by the ghost of Walter, mimicking the way Gina was murdered. Bobby hears Alyssa's screams of pain, and saves her. While tending to her back in his room, Bobby witnesses the scene as it had occurred those years ago; yet, this time, Bobby doesn't let the entire scene play out and rushes to intervene just as Walter is about to give the final blow to Gina. Gina then beats Walter to death with his nightstick and disappears along with her daughter. With the ghosts gone, Bobby comforts Alyssa as the police head towards the apartment.

Eel Girl
 Deep in a secret navy research facility, an armed security officer enters a secure observation room, filled with electronic monitoring equipment and shelves full of dissected fish specimens. The officer requests one of the scientists accompany her immediately. He protests, quoting navy protocols that require two people to remain in the room at all times, but the officer makes sure he knows he has no choice.  The remaining scientist watches them leave the facility on a security monitor. Satisfied he's on his own, he quickly begins to activate override commands on the computer. A warning begins to sound, and the scientist steps back to stand in front of a large observation window, which looks into a dark tiled and dirty room, in the center of which stands a large bath, filled with black viscous liquid. Opposite the window is a large secure door, above which warning lights flash red, then green. The scientist becomes more agitated, breathing heavily, as he sees the door open, and a webbed hand curls around the door frame.  Out of the darkness appears the Eel Girl, naked, her skin pale, gills visible in her cheeks, small fins on her forearms. Slowly she steps into the room, walks around the bath. The scientist watches as she slides into the thick black liquid. In the observation room the computer begins to flash warnings. Distracted by the computer, the scientist doesn't notice the Eel Girl climb slowly out of the bath. She steps up to the window, hands against the glass and looks through. The scientist sees her, moves to the window, places his hands against hers through the glass. She stares back, mouth opening and closing slowly, revealing rows of sharp teeth.  She signals with her eyes, and the scientist moves to the security door that connects his room to hers. He activates the security code and opens the door. Inside she is waiting for him. He walks into the room and embraces her. She reaches up, gently holds the back of his head with one hand. And suddenly - her jaw extends and she pulls his head into her mouth, then lifts him into the air and swallows him whole, vomiting up his shredded clothes. She climbs back into the bath and lies there, caressing her now massively enlarged belly, and the scientist inside it - still alive.  {| class="wikitable" border="1" |+ Cast !Actor !Character |- | [[Julia Rose]] | Eel Girl |- | [[Euan Dempsey]] | The Scientist |- | [[Nick Blake]] | Senior Scientist |- | [[Robyn Paterson]] | Military Officer |- |}

The End of Poverty?
 <blockquote>The aphorism "The poor are always with us" dates back to the New Testament, but while the phrase is still sadly apt in the 21st century, few seem to be able to explain why poverty is so widespread. [[Activist]] filmmaker Philippe Diaz examines the history and impact of [[economic inequality]] in the [[third world]] in ''The End of Poverty?'', and makes the compelling argument that it's not an accident or simple bad luck that has created a growing [[underclass]] around the world. Diaz traces the growth of global poverty back to [[colonialism|colonization]] in the 15th century, and features interviews with a number of economists, sociologists, and historians who explain how poverty is the clear consequence of [[free-market]] economic policies that allow powerful nations to exploit poorer countries for their assets and keep money in the hands of the wealthy rather than distributing it more equitably to the people who have helped them gain their fortunes. Diaz also explores how wealthy nations (especially the [[United States]]) seize a disproportionate share of the world's [[natural resource]]s, and how this imbalance is having a dire impact on the environment as well as the economy.<ref>[http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/the-end-of-poverty-v472919 ''The End of Poverty?''], [[Mark Deming]], [[AllRovi.com]] (retrieved 22 January 2012)</ref></blockquote>

Empty Nest (film)
 The story is centered on a family of five, a father, mother, their two sons, and daughter, revolving around the father. The reality within the diegesis is the one of the father, Leonardo. The film plays with chronology and reality. Leonardo is a well-known writer and playwright, whose his wife left university studies to take care of the family. The film begins with a scene of a dinner in which Leonardo seems uncomfortable because, as is learned later in the film, he is witnessing a possible affair between his wife and an old college friend of hers. The film documents the troubles of the marriage as Leonardo has a brief affair with his dentist shortly after his youngest daughter leaves to [[Israel]] with her new husband Ianib. Leonardo's version of reality is, at many times, questionable during the film. He talks to a doctor that researches memory and they talk about the construction of memory and fantasy and it alludes to the [[self-reflexivity]] of the film. Leonardo's [[Son in Law|son in law]] Ianib leaves behind a book for him to read and asks for his opinion of it. Leonardo takes some time to actually read the book even though he carries it around for most of the film. When he finally reads the book, he is surprised to find out that it is brilliant. This scene is accompanied with a distinct use of lighting that focuses on Leonardo and his absorption within the novel.   The question of [[anti-Semitism]] is brought up in the film. Leonardo is questioned by one of his colleagues after a cartoon that he created is looked down upon as an anti-Semitic caricature of the [[Jewish]] people. Leonardo responds by saying, “Me, anti-Semitic? My daughter married an Israeli”. Leonardo takes his colleague's remarks quite lightly and soon travels to Israel with his wife to visit their daughter. It is during almost the end of the film that the viewer meets Julia and Ianib. Ianib wins a prestigious award for his novel and this serves as a bonding experience between the father and the Jewish son-in-law. Tensions that were built upon during most of the film are released with the time that Leonardo and Ianib spend together in Ianib's home country. Talk of children comes up during dinner and possible [[circumcision]] is mentioned. Ianib and Leonardo find something in common with each other, and while it may not be religion or language, it is their passion for writing. Ianib tells Leonardo, when his memory is questioned by Martha and Julia, “Family stories are always true”. The film closes with shots of the [[landscapes]] of Israel and a bonding moment between Martha and Leonardo before playing with [[chronological]] order once more, going back in time, to offer a scene with Leonardo and Julia talking after she comes home from a date with Ianib.

Joe's gang is not happy with the result and murders one of Zack and Sham's friends/mechanics. Zack angrily walks into the club Joe uses as a front but is almost killed by the gang. He is saved by Sham (and another friend called Musa) but does not acknowledge or thank Sham. Musa convinces Zack that the police should be left to deal with Joe, before someone else dies. The police raid the club and arrest many gang members, though Joe is not caught.  Sham meets Fasha to clear the air, stating that he is unwilling to lose his brotherly friendship with Zack, and that he wants Fasha to stop contacting him altogether. Zack arrives and totally misreads the situation, forcing Fasha to follow him home. Joe arrives in his racing car and attempts to ram Zack and Fasha. They are saved by Sham, who pushes them out of the way at the cost of great injuries. Zack chases Joe down, resulting in Joe crashing head on into a truck and flipping over.  Things finish with Sham in hospital, presumably in a coma. Zack is chastised by his team members and a sobbing Fasha, though he and Fasha sit by Sham's bedside.  
Exit Speed
 In [[Texas]], Sergeant Archie Sparks ([[Fred Ward]]), an MP, has finally caught up with AWOL Corporal Meredith Cole ([[Julie Mond]]), who has been accused of assaulting a commanding officer. When Archie turns his back for a moment, Meredith manages to escape his custody once again.  Cole finds herself on an American Auto Coach bus on her way to [[El Paso]], along with an eclectic group of passengers for what should be an uneventful ride. The bus passes a group of meth-addicted, nomadic bikers who taunt the passengers by performing stunts around the bus. One of the bikers makes a mistake and ends up under the wheels of the bus, resulting in the rest of the bikers seeking revenge. The driver, Danny Gunn ([[David Rees Snell]]) stops the bus to help, and when he gets out, one of the bikers kills him. Stray shots also wound Meredith and passenger Joey Ryan (Danielle Beacham).  Another passenger, Jerry Yarbro ([[Gregory Jbara]]), a high school football coach who was accused of assaulting a student, retrieves the biker's weapon, while Walter Lindley ([[Wally White]]), another passenger, retrieves Danny's keys. The surviving passengers drive away in the bus in an effort to get away from the bikers. As they flee down the highway, Joey dies from her injuries.  The rest of the passengers include single mother Maudie McMinn ([[Lea Thompson]]), moody, wayward father Sam Cutter ([[Desmond Harrington]]), tough woman Desiree (Kelli Dawn Hancock), her extremely skittish boyfriend Duke ([[Nick Sowell]]), Annabel Drake ([[Alice Greczyn]]) a vegan who happens to be a competitive archer, and Ramon Vargas (Everett Sifuentes) a Spanish-speaking electrician.  At Jerry's insistence, they take the bus down a side road. The bikers force the bus off the road at an abandoned junkyard, where the bus crashes, killing Walter. The passengers build a makeshift bunker that the bikers surround. And Jerry, who seems to have anger management issues, still has the gun. The group is now on the defensive against the vengeful bikers. But they realize that in order to survive, they must go on the offensive and fight back against the bikers.  That evening, they make a plan to hold out in the junkyard while Maudie, (a [[marathon]]er), crosses 20 miles of desert to reach the nearest town for help. As the remaining survivors fight back with captured guns, Annabel's target bow, and Ramon's jury-rigged cannon, Maudie gets away from the compound. Maudie meets up with Archie, and they kill some of the bikers.  The two make it back to the compound during the middle of the confrontation, in which the remaining bikers injure Ramon and kill Duke, Desiree, and Jerry. After the remaining bikers are killed, the survivors—Sam, Meredith, Annabel, and Ramon—are driven to the nearest town by Maudie and Archie.  Later, at a hospital, Maudie reunites with her daughters, and Meredith again evades the army, this time with Archie's help. Meredith joins Sam and Annabel as they head back out on the road in a minivan.

Abby warns Andrea of the repercussions of the affair that will likely result her termination from the company, only for Andrea to rebuffs this as she fervently believes William will protect her.  Convinced that they were marital assets, Chris takes the money from the hidden account and pays deposits to start a construction firm with Ben.  Charlotte and Alice return to Atlanta. Andrea confronts Chris for taking her $300,000. She says he and Ben will never be like William. Ben states that nobody cares about William and that Andrea can't see that because of the affair. Andrea admits to Chris that the money was from William, her lover. Angry and disgusted, Chris slaps her, sending her flying over the counter. Andrea, further incensed, tells him to keep the money and move out. As Chris brings up their son, Andrea says William is the father.  Alice tries to persuade Andrea to end her affair with William and reconcile with Chris, explaining to her that their affair will not last and William will never marry her, begging her to stop before her life is destroyed.  Andrea refuses to believe her, and says if that happens, she will enjoy the ride on the way down.  William is plotting to take over the family firm. Although they had never been close, Jillian goes to Charlotte for advice.  Charlotte offers little consolation, but reminds her that she is a woman scorned without a prenuptial agreement, and as such can divorce or reconcile and be okay either way. Jillian warns Charlotte of William's plan to have the board vote her out.  Chris confronts William on a job site and punches him.  Jillian then confronts Andrea in the hotel room where trysts with William were held each Wednesday, and warns her to stay away from her family.  Charlotte calls a board meeting and fires William with the support of the Calvary Company, a silent [[investor]] revealed to be Alice. Alice has been receiving financial guidance for years from Nicholas "Nick" Blanchett ([[Sebastian Siegel]]), a homeless man she frequently fed at her diner. Earlier, it is explained that Nick had been a regular customer who left large tips until he lost his job, wife, and custody. Nick still visits the diner regularly and pays Alice with solid investment advice. Later, it is revealed that Nick had been working for William and fired without cause.  In the parking lot, Andrea approaches William, unaware of the recent events and expecting him to leave Jillian for her. Instead, he washes his hands of Andrea, and drives away, ignoring her claim that her son is his. Charlotte takes a deadly combination of pills and calls Alice, who has an emotional breakdown. Alice gives the [[eulogy]] at Charlotte's funeral.  The movie ends with Chris and Andrea parting, with the paternity of their son left unclear. Chris is now wealthier, after opening a firm with Ben, while Andrea is sad, guilt-ridden, and lonely. Nick is wealthy and buys a house. William & Jillian reconcile, slowly salvaging their marriage. Alice decides to sell the diner and drives off in the car that Charlotte left her (with a photo of her and Charlotte taped to the dashboard) to start life anew on the road.

Feast 2: Sloppy Seconds
 Biker Queen, twin sister of Harley Mom, discovers the severed arm of her sister from the previous film. Upon discovering the surviving Bartender, she tortures him into telling her who killed Harley Mom. He reveals that it was Bozo and points her to a town where he lives. She knocks Bartender out and takes him with her to the town.  Prior to the events of the [[Feast (2005 film)|first film]], the town was overrun by the monsters. A pair of small Mexican wrestlers named Thunder and Lightning were attacked by the monsters and Lightning's girlfriend was killed. Inside the jail, a "Hobo" was in a cell for dealing [[methamphetamine]] and questioned where his school bus (makeshift meth lab) is at. The Sheriff taunted him before being killed. A car salesman named Slasher found evidence of his wife cheating with one of his employees and barely escaped the monsters.  Biker Queen and four of her friends arrive in the deserted town with the Bartender, ignoring the dead bodies as they look for Bozo and cross paths with Slasher, his wife Secrets and the man she has an affair with, Greg. The group is attacked by a monster, which kills one of the biker girls, Tot Girl. The others and the Bartender make their way to Bozo's apartment, where they encounter Honey Pie, the girl who left the group from the first movie behind at the bar. Bartender brutally attacks her and knocks Honey Pie out of the window and onto the street. Honey Pie survives the fall and goes into hiding.  Slasher, Greg and Secrets receive a call from the wrestlers, but before they find them they are ambushed by the bikers. Both groups get to a garage where the brothers and their grandmother are hiding. The group then tries to make it to the jail, but the hobo has sealed himself in.  As the wrestlers try to fashion a skeleton key for the jail house, Greg dissects one of the monsters, gravely injuring the wrestlers' grandmother when the creature vomits. They discover an eye in the creature's intestines that acts like an alarm system, and cause it to make a terrifying howl in the process. As a result, more monsters swarm the garage. The brothers return with the key but the group must go to the roof to escape the monsters. The survivors on the roof hears a baby crying, trapped inside a station wagon Slasher sold prior to the attack. The next morning, Greg tries to save the baby, but when he encounters a monster and his plan backfires, he throws the baby to the air, leaving him to the monster to eat as a distraction when he has trouble escaping.  Meanwhile, Honey Pie, who has spent the night trapped in a store, is ambushed by one of the monsters. She manages to knock it out and uses its claws to make a hole in the bullet-proof glass of the store's door. As she is getting out, the monster regains consciousness and starts to chase her down the street.  Trapped on the roof, the group sacrifices Splat Girl to the monsters and fashion a catapult with Biker Queen's motorcycle and the biker girls' clothes. Using the wrestlers' gravely injured grandmother to test it, they cause her to smash into a wall and die. Thunder gets onto the catapult but is thrown into the street where he is quickly attacked by the monsters and disemboweled. Greg is then severely injured when the bike's tailpipe flies into his head. Meanwhile, Lightning crosses the street under the protection of a trash can. Thunder, missing his legs, crawls away while Lightning picks up the key he had dropped. Lightning reaches the jail house, but as he opens the door the hobo throws a stick of dynamite out. Lightning ducks down in the trashcan to protect himself from the explosion and is launched across the street.  Honey Pie, who made it to the border of the town, is injured by flying shrapnel from the trashcan and falls to the floor, apparently dead. The others watch as the monsters begin breaking onto the rooftop. Suddenly, Honey Pie gets up, grabs her gun and screams in anguish.

The agent has not yet revealed anything but time is pressing.  Louise must first create a commando group of women especially chosen for the needs of the operation. When it comes to recruitment, anything goes: lies, blackmail, bribery (through the offer of remission of a death sentence) and calls to carry out patriotic duty. She first employs Suzy Desprez ([[Marie Gillain]]), a cabaret dancer who excels in the art of seducing men. Then she brings in Gaëlle Lemenech ([[Déborah François]]), a chemist and explosives expert. Finally she selects Jeanne Faussier ([[Julie Depardieu]]), a prostitute capable of killing in cold blood. After their arrival in Normandy, they are joined by Maria Luzzato ([[Maya Sansa]]), an Italian Jew and radio operator.  The mission gets under way well, but quickly becomes complicated.

The [[Gypsy punk]] band that appears in the film is portrayed by real-life [[Gypsy punk]] band, [[Gogol Bordello]], who also contributed three songs to the film's soundtrack. The band's lead singer, [[Eugene Hütz]], portrays the main character – a character with a philosophical attitude towards life. Madonna allowed additional dialogue written by Hütz himself to be included in the film.  
Fireflies in the Garden
 The story moves back and forth between the adolesence and present of successful author Michael Taylor ([[Ryan Reynolds]]) and his extended family: domineering father, English professor Charles ([[Willem Dafoe]]), his mother Lisa ([[Julia Roberts]]), his sister Ryne; as well as Lisa's much younger sister Jane ([[Emily Watson]]) (just older than Michael, act more like cousins since childhood), her husband Jimmy ([[George Newbern]]), their son Christopher ([[Chase Ellison]]) and daughter Leslie ([[Brooklynn Proulx]]). Included in the family mix is Michael's alcoholic ex-wife Kelly (Michael has only told Jane about the breakup).  Charles and Michael had, and still have, a strained relationship, with both pushing the other. In a flash-back to a boyhood road trip, the younger Michael claims to have lost his glasses, knowing he has them in his pocket; Charles makes Michael walk home in the rain as a punishment. This tit-for-tat and rule-breaking continues with Charles imposing on all around him, including Jane, who is staying with them as Lisa is expecting a baby (Ryne). She, too, hates Charles' domineering nature and sides with Michael against him. When Michael embarrasses Charles in front of his colleagues by falsely claiming to have written a poem, ''Fireflies in the Garden'' by [[Robert Frost]], he is punished by having to hold his weighted arms horizontal.  Later, unable to lift his aching arms, Jane feeds him. The conflicts escalate, with Michael eventually intervening in a quarrel between his parents, attacking Charles and forcing him to the ground.  Events in the present are driven by a catastrophe. While college senior Ryne picks up Michael at the airport, Charles and Lisa are driving hurriedly to Jane's house for a party in honor of Lisa's college graduation. Charles swerves to avoid colliding with Christopher, retrieving a ball in the road, and their car hits a tree, killing Lisa and injuring Charles. Ryne and Michael arrive moments later.  Michael attempts to cheer up Jane's children, telling them "Before your mother was a mom, she was my best friend."  He takes them "fishing", exploding the caught fish with [[firecracker]]s, as he had done with Jane growing up. Concerned with what Charles and Jane will think, he encourages the children to lie to their mother about the firecrackers. Jane lovingly chastises Michael for making her kids lie, while Charles angrily chastises him for nearly everything he does. Michael having noisy sex with Kelly, who was notified by Jane about the funeral, does not help matters.  Christopher's guilt and anxiety over the accident cause him to run off one day.  Michael sees him running through a field and assures him that he is not to blame for "Aunt" Lisa's death. Christopher insists on walking home alone after their talk.  Christopher remains missing for several hours, Jane again blaming Michael, though he eventually deduces that Christopher is at the gravesite. More revelations and recriminations ensue, as Michael discovers that his mother was having an affair with her younger professor Addison, and had planned to leave Charles following her graduation. Jane learns from Kelly that she is pregnant (explaining her recent sobriety) and that Michael doesn't know. Michael and Kelly reconcile and they announce their news to the family before they leave. While discussing baby names with Ryne and Kelly, Michael mentions that he likes the name Max for a boy, the name Lisa intended if Ryne had been a boy.  The title of the film derives from the Frost poem, which Michael has also used for the draft of his upcoming book about his childhood. The book includes revelations of the implied sexual misconduct between Charles and Jane during Lisa's pregnancy. Charles' grief over the loss of Lisa, Michael's joy over his pending fatherhood, the happiness captured in a rare home movie with pregnant Lisa enjoying time with Charles, Michael and Jane help Charles and Michael begin to reconcile. No longer wanting to extend the harmful tit-for-tat with his father, Michael destroys the manuscript for his book.  
Finding Amanda
 Working as a television writer for a low-rated sitcom, ''Those McAllister's'', Taylor Peters (Matthew Broderick) has developed a few vices, such as drinking, drug abuse and compulsive gambling, which have previously damaged his career to the extent that he takes sessions with an analyst only so his wife Lorraine (Maura Tierney) can feel he is taking the cure. Adding to this stressful home life is the discovery that their 20-year-old niece Amanda (Brittany Snow) has run away from home to Las Vegas to work as a prostitute. Although he writes a good comic scene for his lead actor Ed Begley, Jr., Taylor still has the need to run off to the track to play the horses, his only vice, but when his wife discovers it and threatens him with divorce, Taylor agrees to go to Amanda and try to get her into a rehab community in Malibu. Taylor goes to Las Vegas and locates Amanda and realizes that, even though she is involved in a dangerous profession, she has accumulated wealth and retained a relatively refined attitude about life.

A Film with Me in It
 Mark (Doherty) is an actor living in a basement flat below his writer friend Pierce (Moran). Residing with his girlfriend, Sally (Huberman), Mark struggles to find work whilst caring for his [[Paralysis|paralysed]] brother, David (O'Doherty). Desperate to avoid paying overdue rent, Mark continually eludes landlord Jack (Allen), meaning he is also unable to inform Jack of the flat's dilapidated state.  Discovering that Mark wasted money meant for the overdue rent, Sally finally decides to end her strained relationship with Mark, informs Jack of the repairs needed, and arranges to move out. The damaged state of the flat reaching its peak, Mark witnesses two consecutive freak accidents; a bookshelf falls and kills his dog, and the living room chandelier collapses and crushes David. Reeling in horror from the events, Mark looks on as Jack appears to repair a high lightbulb atop a wobbly stool, only to fall and pierce his throat with his screwdriver. Pierce then arrives and discovers the corpses, causing him to panic.  Hiding in the bathroom, Mark and Pierce plot to control the situation, only for Sally to return. Discovering David's body, Sally faints and impales herself on Mark's clarinet stand, killing her too. Realizing the absurdity of four consecutive, fatal accidents occurring in one place, Pierce concocts a plan to move Jack's body to an alternative location, as they both had a strong motive to murder him. Shooing Sally's father when he arrives, a police officer (O'Sullivan) then arrives due to an unrelated noise complaint, causing Pierce to panic and take her hostage.  Unable to kill the officer, the duo ties her up and attempts to reason with her. Left unattended, she attempts to escape through a faulty window, only for it to close and crush her head. Now surrounded by several corpses, Pierce finally formulates a plan; placing David, Sally, Jack, and the dog in his car, they drive it to a secluded area and cause it to explode, leaving minimal forensic evidence. Additionally, since three immediate deaths of Mark's acquaintances can place suspicion on him, Mark places his jewellery and clarinet on David's corpse, faking his own death.  Finally moving the officer to the neighbour's garden, Pierce fakes her death as caused by a falling plant pot. Cutting Mark's hair and dressing him as David, the two attempt to pass Mark as his disabled brother, and give Pierce an alibi as his carer in Mark's absence. A closing epilogue then shows Pierce has written a script based on the film's events, and is currently directing it whilst Mark continues to pass as David.

Durrell does not care about Blakha, but nevertheless the pair work together to raise the money they need. First they try to get a loan from a guy named Mordecai at a massage parlor. LeeJohn goes to get a massage hoping to get close to the pretty Chinese attendant. He enjoys the massage immensely but is scared away when his masseuse is revealed to be Mordecai (a man). The next day Durrel attempts to take Lee John's mind off what happened by pointing out a beautiful girl, Tianna the pastor's daughter, heading into the church for service. They follow her into the church and join the mass for service. The church has raised $230,000 dollars and is considering moving to new premises. Lee John comes up with a desperate scheme to rob their neighborhood church. Durrel is against the idea but eventually agrees, seeing no other option. Instead, they are forced to deal with much more than they bargained for.  They enter the church's office and encounter the terrified and smarmy deacon. They soon realize that the church is far from empty, as they believed. They accompany the deacon to a meeting, planning to leave quickly so that his absence does not cause suspicion. During the meeting it is made clear that the Deacon is pushing the pastor to move the church. Tianna sees the deacon for the money-hungry self-righteous man that he is, but is unable to convince her father. She is however close to one of the Church senior members, Momma T. The church choir then show up for an unscheduled rehearsal further endangering the pairs' plans. Finally losing patience, Durrel fires a gun into the air and orders the Deacon to get the money.  When they try to steal the money they find that the money has already been stolen. Enraged, they both hold the church hostage until the money turns up. Durrel ties the pastor up, as he is defiant and difficult. Durrel then interrogates everyone about the money's whereabouts. He appears to suspect Tianna, who looks down on him for obvious reasons. She reminds him that the pastor is her father. Durrel rebukes her by reminding her that without money the church could not move, to which she has no argument. Meanwhile, Lee John takes Timmy, a little boy, to the bathroom as he was making a fuss about wanting to go. When he says that he will return the child back to his mother (the kind sister Doris), the boy reveals that his real mother has left him. Lee John feels empathy for the boy.  The police pass by and Durrell orders everyone to the back room and orders Ricky to poke his head out the door and talk to them. Ricky does so, and attempts to signal to them with blinks and long drawn-out words. However the police simply figure that he is eccentric. The hostages moan that it is too hot. Durell goes to fix the broken air conditioner, while LeeJohn watches over the hostages. To Lee John's bewilderment, sister Doris begins cooking for everyone, using the church's kitchen. Doris gives him a plate, and fondly remembers how her husband loved her cooking on his birthday. He expresses his sadness at never having had a birthday as no one knew his birthday, and is comforted by Sister Doris.  Meanwhile, Durell and Tianna go to fix the air conditioner. After an awkward conversation, where Tianna warms to Durrel and questions what he is doing, they finally get the air-conditioning going. Durell then orders everyone back to the lobby. The blind, deaf janitor finds the missing money. Durell receives a phone call from his son, which he is ashamed to answer. Momma T then asks for Durell's purpose for what he is doing. Durell claims that he is doing it for his son. Momma T rejects his claim and says that Durell is doing it for himself, as he is blaming everyone but the person responsible, himself.  Durell says that he will not lose his son and leaves the money. Unfortunately, cops have surrounded the church blocking their way out. The pastor tells them to escape out the back, which leads to a chase. The two criminals soon get caught. At the trial, which the entire church attends, the Deacon says that they have been accused of stealing 64,000 dollars. But the amount of money he claims was almost stolen was twice the amount the Deacon claimed was collected. This puts the Deacon at question. The case is dropped after no one stands when witnesses are called. Durell goes back to Omunique's apartment, where he is confronted by the men who gave them the wheelchairs.  After he explains his situation, the two men allow him to go and get his son. Omunique opens the door, yelling at Durell and asking him where did the money come from. The money was left at her doorstep and Durell tells her it was a gift. He implores her not take his son away, claiming that his son is all he has. She responds that she will stay. In the end, LeeJohn and Durrel appear much happier. It is implied that Durrel is closer to his ex-wife and son, while LeeJohn remains close to Doris and Timothy. The remaining money is used to restore the community and Tianna is seen painting a [[community centre]].  
Fireproof (film)
  Married couple Caleb ([[Kirk Cameron]]), a fire captain, and Catherine Holt ([[Erin Bethea]]), a hospital administrator are experiencing marital difficulties. At work Caleb underscores the importance of never leaving one's partner while at home he and Catherine argue copiously. Catherine accuses Caleb of being selfish due to his desire to buy a boat taking preference over paying for her mother's medical bills, and frustrated over his habitual use of internet pornography. Caleb feels unappreciated and undervalued. Their constant arguing causes Catherine to demand a divorce, to which an enraged Caleb agrees.  Caleb's coworker Michael ([[Ken Bevel]]) and father John ([[Harris Malcom]]) convince him to hold off on divorce proceedings. His father persuades him to try the [[Love Dare]], a 40-day challenge for improving marriages by changing the way a spouse is treated. Caleb reluctantly agrees, though he decides not to tell Catherine. At the hospital where she works, Catherine has been openly flirting with Dr. Gavin Keller ([[Perry Revell]]).  Caleb begins The Love Dare halfheartedly viewing the tasks as more of a checklist, while nurses at Catherine's hospital warn her not to trust him as they interpret his actions as a way to butter her up for a better divorce settlement. With encouragement from his father and Michael, Caleb continues, though Catherine eschews his affections and grows closer to Dr. Keller. Finding Catherine unmoved, Caleb is consoled by his father while Michael reveals that he has been divorced. Caleb sustains burns on the job, and while being treated at the hospital where his wife works, Dr. Keller inadvertently discovers that Catherine is married and he is treating her husband, but continues his affections. Caleb continues The Love Dare with renewed faith and Catherine gives him an envelope petitioning for divorce.  Catherine discovers that her mother's medical costs have been paid anonymously and thinks it was Dr. Keller, bringing them closer. Caleb discovers the burgeoning affair and confronts the doctor. After Caleb leaves, Dr. Keller produces a wedding band, revealing that he is also married, and ends his affections towards Catherine.    Catherine confronts Caleb after discovering his Love Dare journal, and he reveals to her that he has completed the challenge but is still following its guidelines. Catherine says she needs time to reconsider the divorce, and discovers that her husband used his savings to pay her mother's medical bills. Moved by Caleb's selflessness, Catherine reconciles with him. Caleb discovers that his mother, whom he has treated poorly, is actually the one who completed The Love Dare for his father, and not vice versa as Caleb had originally thought. The film ends with Caleb and Catherine renewing their wedding vows.  
Fix (film)
 Racing across Los Angeles in one, unwieldy day, documentary filmmakers Bella and Milo race from Beverly Hills to Watts and places in between to get Milo's brother Leo from jail to rehab before 8pm, or Leo goes to prison for three years. A story inspired by true events, the trio documents their trip from a suburban police station in Calabasas through mansions in Beverly Hills, East LA chop-shops, rural wastelands, and housing projects in Watts as they attempt to raise the $5,000 required to get Leo into the rehab clinic.  Along the way encountering dozens of colorful characters, each with their own anomalous perspective on Leo's larger than life personality and style, and each with their own excuse for why they cannot help out. In the end, it may take a drug deal to get the necessary funds for rehab.

Flash of Genius (film)
 On his wedding night in 1953, an errant champagne cork renders college engineering professor [[Robert Kearns]] ([[Greg Kinnear]]) almost completely blind in his left eye. A decade later, he is happily married to Phyllis ([[Lauren Graham]]) and the father of six children. As he drives his [[Ford Galaxie]] through a light rain, the constant movement of the windshield wipers irritates his troubled vision. The incident inspires him to create a wiper blade mechanism modeled on the human eye, which blinks every few seconds rather than continuously.  With financial support from Gil Previck ([[Dermot Mulroney]]), Kearns converts his basement into a laboratory and develops a [[prototype]] he tests in a fish tank before installing it in his car. He patents his invention and demonstrates it for Ford researchers, who had been working on a similar project without success. Kearns refuses to explain how his mechanism works until he hammers out a favorable deal with the corporation. Impressed with Kearns' results, executive Macklin Tyler ([[Mitch Pileggi]]) asks him to prepare a business plan detailing the cost of the individual units, which Kearns intends to manufacture himself. Considering this to be sufficient commitment from the company, Kearns rents a warehouse he plans to use as a factory and forges ahead. He presents Ford with the pricing information it requested along with a sample unit, then waits for their response. Time passes, and when nobody contacts Kearns, he begins placing phone calls that are never returned.  Frustrated, Kearns attends a Ford dealers convention at which the latest model of the [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]] is unveiled, promoting the intermittent wiper as a selling point. Realizing the company has used his idea without giving him credit or payment for it, Kearns begins his descent into a despair so deep he boards a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] and heads for [[Washington, D.C.]], where he apparently hopes to find legal recourse. Instead, [[Maryland]] [[state trooper]]s remove him from the bus and escort him to a [[mental hospital]], where he is treated for a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]]. Finally released when doctors decide his obsession has subsided, he returns home a broken man, determined to receive public acknowledgement for his accomplishment. Thus begins years of legal battles, during which time his wife leaves him, and he becomes estranged from his children.   At trial, Kearns represents himself after attorney Gregory Lawson ([[Alan Alda]]) withdraws from the case, because Robert refuses to [[settlement (law)|settle]]. Eventually Kearns' ex-wife and children support him in his endeavor. Toward the end of the trial, Ford offers Kearns a US$30 million settlement, but without admitting wrongdoing. Kearns decides to leave his fate in the hands of the jury, who determine that Ford infringed his patents, but that the infringement was not deliberate. The jury awards him US$10.1 million. The closing credits indicate that Robert later wins an US$18.7 million judgement from [[Chrysler Corporation]] as well.  
Five Dollars a Day
 Richie Flynn Parker ([[Alessandro Nivola]]) is a seemingly successful man living in [[Los Angeles, California]] who has just broken up with his girlfriend Maggie ([[Amanda Peet]]). He has also just been fired from his job as a health inspector when he discovers his father Nat ([[Christopher Walken]]), a cheap con-man, has a terminal brain tumor and he wants to see Richie. Richie, believing it's another con, grudgingly goes to [[Atlantic City]] to see his father who explains he has been living on five dollars a day, going to extremes to do so, such as constantly calling various radio station contests with different aliases to win things, like concert tickets he can then scalp. Nat shows Ritchie an x-ray of his skull, and asks Ritchie to drive him to [[New Mexico]] to seek a potential cure. The father and son hit the road driving a [[Sweet'n Low]] car free of charge provided they get gas at [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] stations along the way. Richie calls his girlfriend to tell her about his life and the trip, using one of Nat's many free cell-phones with promotional minutes.  After their first stop to eat at an [[IHOP]] restaurant for free by Nat convincing them it's his birthday using a fake drivers license (which Nat continues to do at other IHOPs along the way), they stop at a vacant house that is for sale to spend the night, and narrowly avoid being found out by a realtor and some people looking at the home the following morning. The next day over a stolen room service meal from a motel, Richie finds out that Nat got him fired by telling his boss of an earlier jail sentence, which is later revealed that Richie took the fall for to keep Nat from going to jail for one of his crimes. This almost makes Richie abandon the trip. They proceed to drive to various cities, once staying at an open house for a retirement village. They then go to [[Amarillo, Texas]] where they meet up with Richie’s old babysitter, Dolores ([[Sharon Stone]]), who is now a professional model Nat has a thing for.  They then head to New Mexico so that Nat can collect a small sum of money from an old rival, Kruger ([[Peter Coyote]]), whom Nat lent money to start a used car dealership many years back, and whom Richie's mother later ran off with when he was young. Kruger, now owner of a hugely successful chain of car dealerships, and a well established member of the community with wife and family, agrees to give Nat a large sum of quiet money so that Nat does not upset Kruger's plans to run for mayor by embarrassing Kruger regarding Ritchie's paternity.  Flush with cash, Nat suggests to Richie that the two of them visit [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to spend some time together, but Richie soon realizes that Nat is not his actual father and Nat convinces him that his story about being sick was a ruse to get him to travel with him to New Mexico. Upset with this news, Richie runs off with the hush money and sneaks into Kruger's campaign kick-off party to confront him. Not satisfied with how Kruger responds, Richie rushes the campaign stage to announce Kruger's paternity and simulates the return of the hush money.  After escaping capture by campaign security, Richie returns to the hotel where he meets back up with Nat. After some discussion, Nat collapses and winds up in the hospital, actually very ill. Maggie shows up after Richie calls her to break the news. They sneak Nat out of the hospital, and Nat takes Richie to a beached boat house near the shore of a desert lake, where the two go [[skinny dip]]ping.  Later, Richie and Maggie are shown sitting in a row boat on the lake, scattering Nat's ashes from a makeshift urn consisting of a large [[Pepsi]] cup that Nat got for free with a five dollar purchase of gas. The boat begins to sink as they laugh at their circumstance.  
Flame & Citron
 Set after the [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|Nazi invasion of Denmark]], the film focuses on the [[Holger Danske (resistance group)|Holger Danske]] resistance group's [[Bent Faurschou Hviid]] (known as Flammen) and [[Jørgen Haagen Schmith]] (known as Citron). In a bar, Bent flirts with a woman, who identifies herself as Ketty Selmer and disturbs him by saying his real name. Bent follows the woman and confronts her, whereupon she tells him that she is a courier running messages between Stockholm and Copenhagen.  Aksel Winther, Bent and Jørgen's handler, signals to them to kill Elisabeth Lorentzen, Horst Gilbert, and Hermann Seibold–members of the [[Abwehr]], the German military intelligence service. Bent and Jørgen argue over it as they kill only Danes, to reduce the chance of retaliation by the Nazis. However, Winther claims orders from the government in exile in London. Bent kills Lorentzen but fails to kill Gilbert and Seibold. Later, Jørgen, his wife, Bodil, and their daughter, Ann, celebrate the girl's birthday on their car as they are without money, and Bodil laments over their relationship. Three weeks later, Bent, Jørgen and Whinter meet Spex from the [[Danish Security and Intelligence Service|Danish Army Intelligence]]. He says there will be no more attacks, as they need peace to assemble men for a big attack. The three agree that they should not follow Spex's order, and later Jørgen kills Gilbert. That night, Jørgen robs a grocery store and takes the products to his wife and daughter; however, Bodil announces she is seeing another man.  After several members of the resistance are killed by the [[Gestapo]], Winther suspects they have an informant among them. Later, Bent visits Ketty's hotel room, and they have sex. Meanwhile, Jørgen visits his wife and advises her boyfriend to treat her properly or he will return. In a meeting, Winther says the informer is Ketty and orders her death. Bent meets Ketty; she tells him she works for both Winther and army intelligence, and that Winther does not work for the British. Winther, involved with Gilbert and Seibold, had ordered them to be killed in order not to be seen as a traitor. Bent and Jørgen search for Winther in the bar and discover that he has escaped to Stockholm. They realize it is a trap, and they escape from the Gestapo men. They decide to kill Karl Heinz Hoffmann, the Gestapo's leader, and then take over the favorite Gestapo restaurant. Bent cannot kill Hoffmann because they have to get away when he notices the police coming. That night, Ketty says to Bent that he and Jørgen should go to Stockholm. In the meeting, they are offered positions in the Danish Army but they refuse. A man called Ravnen gives them the name of the real informer, and Jørgen soon kills him.  Bent visits his father, the owner of a hotel, who says Hoffmann, his family and his mistresses visit there on occasion.

Flashbacks of a Fool
 Joe Scott ([[Daniel Craig]]) is a has-been actor, who seemed to have had great success at one time but who now just spends his time drinking, doing drugs and sleeping with random women. The only person he has in his life is his personal assistant Ophelia and even she is getting tired of him. He receives a call from his mother to say his childhood best friend, Boots, whom he has not seen in years, has died. He attends a disastrous meeting with an up-and-coming director and his agent, who has lost interest in Joe. Joe learns he will not get the part he had hoped would restore his flagging career. His agent tells him that he is washed up, no one wants to work with him and quits. This upsets Joe, who goes for a walk along the beach and walks into the waves. Floating in the sea, he remembers his teenage life.  The film flashes back 25 years, to a 16-year-old Joe ([[Harry Eden]]) and his best friend Boots ([[Max Deacon]]). We find out that Boots has epilepsy and has recently had an attack in the cinema. Joe’s next-door neighbour, a bored housewife named Evelyn ([[Jodhi May]]), comes on to him and invites him over that evening, where they are almost caught in flagrante by her unsuspecting husband. The next day, Joe meets up with a popular but quirky girl his own age from town, Ruth ([[Felicity Jones]]). She invites him back to her house and he accepts, leaving Boots alone and angry. Joe is impressed by Ruth's home and her parents' record collection. Ruth applies make up to Joe's face, telling him "think Roxy Girl" while she decides to be [[Bryan Ferry]]. The song is Roxy Music's "If There Is Something". Both of them dance and indicate their interest in each other. Next day, Evelyn watches Joe in the bathroom, seducing him to come to her home on the way to his date. Evelyn coaxes Joe to stop with her and they end up having sex; Joe arrives late to meet Ruth, who has been kept company by Boots.  Ruth sees love bites from Evelyn on his neck and storms off. Boots questions Joe if he had sex with Evelyn. Joe declines calmly but Boots questions him again, this time making Joe angry. In his frustration, Joe has a fight with Boots. The next day, Evelyn comes on to Joe again, asking him about his date. Joe responds that it was terrible, due to the visible love bites on his neck. She responds saying she really liked how he touched her, then invites him to her house if he wants to repeat it. She proceeds to force her little girl, Jane ([[Jodie Tomlinson]]), who was watching TV, out to play so they can have the house to themselves. While Joe and Evelyn are in bed, Jane finds a washed up mine, climbs on it and detonates it and is killed instantly. Joe blames himself, runs away on the day of the little girl's funeral and doesn't return.  Now in the present, Joe returns to England to attend Boots' funeral but he is too late and has missed it. His mother and Aunt tell him that Boots died of an aneurysm and left behind his wife Ruth ([[Claire Forlani]]), four young children and a lot of debt. Joe goes to the graveyard to meet Ruth, who tells him how much she loved Boots and what a wonderful person he was but how she cannot cry, even though it is the saddest moment of her life. His sister tells him that Evelyn also died a few years ago. Evelyn's marriage had broken up after Jane died and she married a man (shown briefly at a fishing scene in Act 1), who beat her. When Evelyn finally found the courage to leave the guy, she was struck and killed by a truck. Her head was never found at the crash site; officials suggested it was taken by a fox. Joe goes back home to the grand house he purchased for his family when his career was going well. He listens to the same music he and Ruth listened to the night they danced and decides to write her a cheque to help her out. He encloses with the cheque a letter, which has a special phrase written in it "shake your hair girl with your ponytail, takes me right back....." from the song they shared the night they met. When Joe's sister gives it to her, Ruth instantly breaks down crying. Brought down to Earth by his friend's death and Ruth's grief, Joe heads back to Los Angeles and is met by his personal assistant, with whom he starts talking about his possibilities as an actor in the future.

The Flight Before Christmas (2008 film)
 Niko, a young [[reindeer]], is told by Oona, his mother, that his father is one of the "Flying Forces", Santa's flying reindeer. For years, Niko has dreamed of joining his father in the Flying Forces, but he himself is unable to fly and even has a fear of heights. While trying to fly with the encouragement of Julius, a [[flying squirrel]], the other young reindeer teased Niko. To avoid further teasing, Niko and his friend Saga leave their protected valley so Niko can practice without any disruptions. However, they are spotted by [[wolves]] and flee back to the herd in panic, but wind up luring the wolf pack to the valley. As the herd flees, Saga's father battles and defeats a wolf, but is wounded in the process. Later, Niko overhears others talking of how his actions have damaged the herd, and decides to leave the herd in an attempt to find his father and Santa's Fell.  When Niko is discovered missing, Julius chooses to look for Niko, since he can search without leaving a trail as fresh snow is falling. Once he finds him, Julius is unable to convince Niko to return to the herd, and reluctantly joins him in the search for Santa's secret location. Meanwhile, Essie, a lost pet poodle, stumbles upon the wolf pack and is about to be eaten, but suggests to Black Wolf, the alpha wolf, the idea of killing Santa's reindeer. Essie is considered Black Wolf's good luck charm for this idea and is spared, but is also forced to join the pack. Niko and Julius discover Wilma, a weasel, stuck in a small tree branch and rescue her. She reluctantly joins Niko and Julius, believing she is indebted to them. Julius and Niko later get separated in a sudden blizzard and Niko wakes up under a pile of snow, unnoticed by the nearby wolf pack. Niko overhears Black Wolf resolving to kill Santa as well and take his place so he could also eat children.  When Niko is discovered, he flees and finds Julius, but the two are cornered between rock cliffs. Wilma saves them by triggering an avalanche with her singing, then guides Niko and Julius to safety. She then continues to follow them, since she knows the way to Santa's home due to having previously worked there as a singer. Eventually, Niko tries to cross a dangerous river by flying with Wilma's help, but fails and falls once he looks down. Thinking they are dead, the wolves head for Santa's home. At the same time, Julius and Wilma save Niko from going over a high waterfall.  While waiting for Niko to recover, Julius recounts how his real family was taken by wolves, and says that he has viewed Niko like a son now. Once they arrive at Santa's place, Niko is almost hit by the Flying Forces while standing on the runway. Niko tells them of Black Wolf's plan, but they doubt a wolf would discover Santa's secret valley. As they celebrate at their bar before heading out on Christmas Eve, Wilma sings them a song that asks them the identity of Niko's father. None of the reindeer respond, but they decide to do a "flying test" to see if Niko has the genetics to fly and thus prove if his claim is true. Upon realizing the potential danger of this, Julius yells at Niko while he is in midflight, so he falls again but is saved by Dasher. After this, the wolves find their way into the valley and the scared reindeer lose their power of flight. Black Wolf chooses to pursue Niko and corners him up a tall tree.  Meanwhile, as the other reindeer are cornered on the runway by the other wolves, Julius convinces the reindeer that they can fly, allowing them to save Niko using the sleigh. Black Wolf latches onto the sleigh, but Julius dislodges the part he is holding on to. In order to save Julius from falling as well, Niko jumps off the sleigh, only to realize that he can finally fly. Niko, backed up by the Flying Forces, send the wolves fleeing when they realize Black Wolf's death. Prancer, congratulating Niko on his bravery, reveals that he is his father. Afterwards, Niko meets Santa, who invites him to join the Flying Forces. However, after Julius leaves to update Niko's mother and the herd on his well-being, Niko chooses to stay with his mother and Julius, but intends to visit Prancer. Niko and Julius then take the herd to a new valley.  
The Flyboys (film)

Fly Me to the Moon (film)
  The narrator explains that in 1957, the [[Soviet Union]] launched Earth's first satellite [[Sputnik 1]] into orbit. Four years later in 1961, when [[NASA]] was putting a monkey named [[Enos (chimpanzee)|Enos]] aboard [[Mercury Atlas 5]], astronaut [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first man on [[Earth]] to go to space. Feeling the sense of urgency to overtake the Soviets in the space race, U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] made a huge statement toward a joint session of Congress on May 25, 1961, stating that before the decade is out, he plans to launch a man to the [[Moon]] and return him safely to the Earth.  8 years later, in 1969, an 11-year-old fly named Nat and his two best friends, I.Q. and Scooter, build a "fly-sized" rocket in a field across from Cape Canaveral, Florida, where [[Apollo 11]] sits on the [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39]]. From his earliest memory, Nat remembers his grandfather, Amos, telling him of his daring rescue of [[Amelia Earhart]] when she crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on her historic flight in [[Amelia Earhart#1932 transatlantic solo flight|1932]]. Wanting to be an adventurer like his grandpa, Nat, defying the notion that "Dreamers get swatted", tells his friends his plan to get aboard Apollo 11 and go to the moon. They, with some reluctance, are in. The next morning, the three flies make it in to Mission Control. In their homemade space suits, Nat, I.Q. and Scooter manage to stow away inside the space helmets of astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]], [[Buzz Aldrin]] and [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]].  Back on Earth, Grandpa, Mom and the others watch TV to get news of their offspring's adventure. As the astronauts appear on camera, the heroic flies wave in the background, visible to other flies but barely seen by humans – except for the attentive [[NASA]] [[flight controller]] [[Steve Bales]], who informs Armstrong that there appear to be "contaminants" on board. In the [[Soviet Union]], there are other flies watching TV – Soviet flies who cannot tolerate the idea that American flies might get to the moon first. A Soviet plan is hatched and special operatives are enlisted to interfere with the American mission. The Soviet Union puts all its hopes of success on the back of one nasty operative named Yegor. Fortunately, a pretty Soviet fly named Nadia also sees the flies on board and hears Scooter calling out Grandpa's real name, the very name of the fly Nadia met in Paris and loved so many years ago.  Back on board the space ship, as the burn cycle to enter the moon's [[trans-lunar injection]] orbit begins, the spacecraft is violently rocked. There's a short circuit in the [[service module]] that must be fixed manually or the ship won't be able to complete its mission. Nat and I.Q. fly through a maze of wires, find the problem and repair it just in time. Unaware of the flies' aid, the ship enters orbit and all is well... or so they think. Just as they congratulate each other, the little flies are sprayed with a numbing aerosol and held captive in a test tube vial.  The flies manage to break the vial. Nat sneaks into Armstrong's helmet just in the nick of time. The [[Lunar Module]] ''Eagle'' lands on [[Mare Tranquillitatis]]. From inside the helmet, Nat beams with every awe-inspiring historic step. I.Q. and Scooter join him on the surface inside Aldrin's helmet. After a climatic rescue with Nat bringing Scooter back to the ''Columbia'', the ''Eagle'' is jettisoned. Back on Earth, other plots are being set in motion. After more than 30 years apart, Nadia finds Grandpa, though the joy of their reunion is brief. She tells Grandpa and Nat's Mom about the Soviet plot to divert the mission. Nat's mom faints while Grandpa takes off with a renewed youthful vow to save his grandson. At [[Mission control center|Mission Control]], the Soviet operatives prepare to alter the descent codes. Unaware of the potential danger looming, the astronauts and the little flies sit back and prepare to come back home as heroes.  Grandpa, Nat's mother and Nadia join forces to stop Yegor and the Soviet plan as the [[Command module]] ''[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]'' hurtles closer and closer toward Earth's atmosphere. In a series of death-defying stunts, they crush the Soviet threat. After a short period of radio silence due to [[ionization blackout]], the ''Columbia'' splashes down safely in the [[Pacific Ocean]], where it is recovered by the ''[[USS Hornet (CV-12)|USS Hornet]]''. Returning as heroes, the three little flies share a slogan embraced by all: "Adventure forever! Dreamers get swatted? Never!"  At the end the real [[Buzz Aldrin]] explains that no flies were on board during the historic flight, and it is scientifically impossible for a bug to go to space.

On his way home, Tripitikas is harassed by some hooligans, whose leader Lupo attempts to use him to help them rob the shop-owner Hop, who is shot by Lupo. Hop tells Tripitikas to deliver the staff to its rightful owner and Tripitikas flees with the staff. He is cornered on the rooftop before being pulled off the roof by the staff.  When Tripitikas regains consciousness, he finds himself in a village in [[History of China|ancient China]] that is under attack by armored soldiers. The soldiers see his staff and attempt to seize it. He is saved by the inebriated traveling scholar [[Lü Dongbin|Lu Yan]], a supposed "immortal," who remains alert and agile even when drunk. Lu tells him the story of the rivalry between the King and the Jade Warlord. The Warlord tricked the King into setting aside his magic staff, [[Ruyi Jingu Bang]], and transformed the immortal into a stone statue, but the King cast his staff far away before the transformation. Lu ends the tale with a prophecy about a "Seeker" who will find the staff and free the King. Just then, they are attacked by the Warlord's men again, but manage to escape with the help of Golden Sparrow, a young woman. She reveals that her family was murdered by the Warlord, against whom she has sworn revenge.  Meanwhile, the Warlord, upon learning about the staff, sends the witch [[List of Baifa Monü Zhuan characters#Main characters|Ni-Chang]] to help him retrieve it in exchange for the elixir of immortality.

As the four travel to [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Five Elements Mountain]], Lu and the Monk teach Tripitikas [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] along the way. After crossing a desert, they encounter Ni-Chang and her henchmen and a battle ensues, in which Lu is mortally wounded. Tripitikas’s team takes refuge in a monastery, where they learn that Lu is actually not an immortal as he failed the test, and only the Warlord’s elixir can save his life. In desperation, Tripitikas goes to the Warlord's palace alone to exchange the staff for the elixir.  The Warlord asks Tripitikas to duel Ni-Chang to death, since the former can give the elixir to only one of them. Tripitikas is overpowered until his teammates and monks from the monastery arrive to join the battle. Tripitikas manages to grab the elixir and tosses it to Lu, who drinks it and recovers. The Monk passes the staff to Tripitikas, who uses it to smash the King's statue. The King is freed and the Monk is revealed to be actually one of the King's clones. Lu kills Ni-Chang. After another long battle between the King and the Warlord, the latter is eventually stabbed by Tripitikas and falls into a [[lava]] pit to his death. However, Sparrow succumbs to her wounds. The [[Jade Emperor]], having returned from his meditation, praises Tripitikas for fulfilling the prophecy and allows him for one wish, which he asks to return home.  Tripitikas finds himself back in the present. He overpowers Lupo and drives the other hooligans away. Hop survives being shot and claims that he is immortal (hinting that he is actually Lu).

Forgetting Sarah Marshall
 Composer Peter Bretter ([[Jason Segel]]) is in a five-year relationship with actress Sarah Marshall ([[Kristen Bell]]), who stars in a ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]''-like television show titled ''Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime''. One day, as Peter stands stark naked in their apartment, Sarah announces that she is breaking up with him. Devastated, and unable to banish his grief through one-night stands, Peter takes a trip to Hawaii. However, the vacation is ruined when he learns that Sarah and her new rock star boyfriend Aldous Snow ([[Russell Brand]]) are also guests of the resort. Taking pity on him, hotel concierge Rachel ([[Mila Kunis]]) offers him an expensive suite for free in exchange for cleaning up the room himself.  Peter begins spending time with Rachel and starts to develop feelings for her. Meanwhile, the relationship between Sarah and Aldous begins to falter. Much of the discord is triggered by the news that Sarah's TV show has been canceled and that Aldous is about to embark on a world tour with his group, Infant Sorrow, for 18 months. During a day of surf and sand Aldous and Peter run into each other and begin talking. Inadvertently, Aldous informs Peter that he and Sarah began having sex a full year before she broke up with Peter. When Peter confronts Sarah, she tells him she began feeling disconnected emotionally from him and she couldn't do anything to make their relationship work. Further exacerbating the situation is Sarah's obvious jealousy of the budding relationship between Peter and Rachel, while Peter (through observing Sarah's relationship with Aldous) begins to realize that his relationship with her wasn't as great as he remembered.  Sarah, Aldous, Peter, and Rachel later share an awkward dinner together. After the dinner, Peter takes Rachel back to his hotel room and they begin to have sex. Sarah hears them through the wall and initiates sex with Aldous, moaning loudly for the benefit of the couple next door, and Rachel and Peter turn the situation into a competition and become even louder. When Aldous realizes Sarah is clearly putting on a performance to provoke a reaction from Peter, he stops the sex and tells her the trip was a mistake as she's clearly not over Peter. They bicker furiously, prompting Aldous to announce that the relationship is over. The next day Peter encounters Aldous, and learns that he and Sarah have broken up and that he is flying back to England.  Peter goes to Sarah's room to console her where she admits she still loves him and tries to rekindle their romance. The two start to engage in sexual activity, but Peter abruptly cuts it off because of his feelings for Rachel, and his now ambivalent feelings towards Sarah. Peter immediately goes to Rachel to confess what happened, but she is hurt and demands that he leave and never contact her again. Before leaving, Peter takes down a naked picture of Rachel from a local bar despite enduring a beat-down from the owner.  He flies back to Los Angeles and after a period of sadness and self-loathing, he begins working on his [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] puppet comedy-rock opera, ''A Taste for Love''. He sends an invitation to Rachel for the opening night performance. Although extremely hesitant at first, Rachel eventually decides to attend. After the performance Rachel congratulates Peter and tells him she's looking into attending school in the area. She leaves so Peter can bask in the success of his show, but quickly returns to Peter's dressing room to tell him she misses him. Peter tells her that he has missed her, too. The film ends as they embrace and kiss.

Natalie's father knocks down the door, only to find Natalie dying, with a pair of scissors lodged into her neck.  That night Natalie's father is haunted by a ghostly figure and is found the following day, hanged in the same room Natalie died in, by his niece Molly.  On Monday at school Lindsay's boyfriend, Dylan, who is the son of the local pastor, is found publicly attacking Aidan Spindle, a newly returned local misfit. Dylan blames Aidan's family for the recent deaths. Following the fight, Lindsay helps Aidan with his minor wounds and drives him home. It turns out that Aidan's brother is Sean, the young man who killed himself at the start of the film but whose death has been overshadowed by Natalie's.  The same night Molly starts seeing a ghost that looks exactly like herself which slits Molly's wrists. The following day, Lindsay's best friend Claire drives past Molly's body, and immediately begins to hear voices. Later the same day, a duplicate of Claire is seen in the toilets while Claire is using the facilities.  Simultaneously, Lindsay becomes aware of the religious fervor Dylan is stirring up against Aidan among the townsfolk and goes to warn him of the danger. On entering his house, she meets his cousin, Sadie who had traveled down from New York for Aidan's brother Sean's funeral.  Meanwhile, Claire encounters and unsuccessfully tries to evade her doppelganger. It finally catches up with her as she is driving and her car explodes in front of Lindsay's mother Trish, who tried to rescue her.  Aidan takes Lindsay to a stream running underneath a bridge, and confirms that his mother practiced a form of witchcraft, which may be the cause of the suicides. He tells her to leave Grovetown.  Lindsay arrives home that night and is abducted by Dylan and Roy, Trish's lover, with Trish's consent. She is taken to the local church to be "purified". Returning home that night, Trish is jubilant about "being saved" but is later haunted by doppelgangers of herself on the television. After being stalked throughout the house, Trish's doppelganger compels her to drink drain cleaner, believing it to be whiskey.  Lindsay finds Trish's body and she rushes to Aidan's house, frantic in her belief that a curse has gotten inside of her and will demand her death. Aidan admits that victims of the curse see themselves, but swears that all victims commit suicide because they are compelled to, not because something takes over them. Aidan supplies Lindsay with an oil on her skin that will slow the progress of the curse. Aidan realizes that the black book is the key to lock up what Sean had unlocked.  Lindsay suggests the church as the new location of the book and Lindsay and Aidan break in. Dylan, Roy, Pastor Joe and Paul, another member of Joe's congregation, realize that Aidan retrieved the book. Back at Aidan's house Sadie pulls a gun on Aidan and Lindsay; she wants the book and explains that Sean deliberately killed himself in order for the curse to start.  They manage to rescue the book just as Sadie attempts to burn it. Paul, Roy and Dylan burst into the home. Aidan and Lindsay escape to the woods, Dylan and Paul following as Roy guards Sadie. While running, Aidan and Lindsay split, intending to meet up at the pier.  Back at the home Roy tells Sadie how he became a religious man and then sets her alight with gasoline, claiming that he is doing God's will. In the woods, Lindsay makes it to the pier, but her doppelganger ghost is hot on her tail. She stops at the edge of the platform and starts reciting a prayer, when she falls into the water.  Meanwhile, Dylan continues to hunt Aidan but he is surprised from behind by Aidan. Aidan puts Sadie's gun to Dylan's head when Lindsay's screams for help draw him away. Lindsay panics in the water as her doppelganger emerges from the water behind her. Lindsay quickly climbs out of the water alive, then blood drips onto her back, the ghost's eye is bleeding as Lindsay sits up. The ghost grabs the rope and hands it to Lindsay, who starts to wrap it around her own neck and strangle herself.  Aidan rushes to her and stops her.  They then continue with dispelling the curse. Aidan merges his own blood with Sean's on the book, when he says to Lindsay that a sacrifice started the curse so a sacrifice must end it. Aidan passionately kisses her and tells her to burn the book, before seemingly shooting himself.  Dylan and Paul then show up, Dylan believing Lindsay to be a devil worshiper he pulls his gun on her. Lindsay stands, Sadie's gun in her hands as she begs Dylan to walk away. He raises his rifle at her and she shoots him. Paul quickly runs off. Not long after the cops arrive, but they find that Aidan's sacrifice doesn't count; Dylan had actually shot him in the chest as Aidan was pointing the gun at his own head.  In the woods, Lindsay tries to burn the book, but to no avail as the curse is still around, the ghost creates a gust of wind blowing the fire out before claiming Lindsay.

Frost/Nixon (film)
 After the Watergate scandal of 1972 and his subsequent resignation in 1974, 400 million people worldwide watched Nixon leave the White House. Among them is British journalist David Frost, currently recording a talk show in Australia, who decides to interview Nixon.  Nixon’s literary agent, [[Irving Lazar]], believes the interview would be an opportunity for Nixon to salvage his reputation, and to make some money. Lazar demands $500,000, and ultimately gets $600,000 and Frost accepts.  After persuading his friend and producer [[John Birt]] that the interviews would be a success, Frost and Birt travel to California to meet with Nixon. On the plane to California, Frost flirts with a young woman called Caroline Cushing, and they begin a relationship.  Frost struggles to sell the interviews to U.S. networks, and decides to finance the project with private money and syndicate the broadcast of the interviews. He hires two investigators — Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr. — to help him prepare, along with Birt. Frost is not clear on what he wants from the interview, and Reston encourages him to aim for a confession from Nixon.  Under scrutiny by Nixon's post-presidential chief of staff, Jack Brennan, Frost and Nixon embark on the first three recording sessions. Frost is restricted by an agreed-upon timeframe and, under pressure from his own team, attempts to ask tough questions, but Nixon dominates the sessions regarding Vietnam and his achievements in foreign policy. Behind the scenes, Frost's editorial team is nervous about the interviewer's technique and angry that Nixon appears to be exonerating himself.  Four days before the final session, which will center on Watergate, Frost receives a phonecall from an inebriated Nixon. In a drunken rant, Nixon declares that they both know the final interview will make or break their careers, and compares himself to Frost, insisting that they both came from humble backgrounds and had to struggle to make it to the top of their fields, only to be knocked back down again. Frost gains new insight into his subject, while Nixon assures Frost that he will do everything in his power to emerge the victor from the final interview.  The conversation spurs Frost into action. He works relentlessly for three days to prepare, while Reston pursues a lead at the Federal Courthouse in Washington.  As the final recording begins, Frost ambushes Nixon with damning transcripts of a conversation between Nixon and Charles Colson that Reston dug up in Washington. As his own team watches in horror from an adjoining room, Nixon admits that he did unethical things, adding, "When the President does it, that means it's not illegal." A stunned Frost is on the verge of inducing a confession when Brennan bursts in and stops the recording. After Nixon and Brennan confer, the interview resumes, Frost aggressively pursues his original line of questioning, and Nixon admits that he participated in a cover-up and that he "let the American people down."  After the interview, Frost and Caroline pay a farewell visit to Nixon at his villa. Frost thanks Nixon for the interviews and Nixon, graciously admitting defeat, thanks Frost in return and wishes him well, privately adding that he has no recollection of calling Frost while drunk. He also for the first time addresses Frost by his first name. Nixon watches Frost and Caroline Cushing leave and then leans over a railing of his villa, looking out at the sunset.  An epilogue states that the interviews were wildly successful and that Nixon never escaped controversy until his death in 1994.  
Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs
  A month after the universe was ripped open in ''[[Futurama: Bender's Big Score]]'', people decide to go on with their lives. [[Amy Wong|Amy]] and [[Kif Kroker|Kif]] get married. Fry starts dating a girl named Colleen, but breaks up with her when he discovers she has many more boyfriends.  At a conference, [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] proposes an expedition to investigate the [[wikt:anomaly|anomaly]] after beating his rival, Wernstrom, in a game of ''Deathball'' (a gigantic version of ''[[Labyrinth (marble game)|Labyrinth]])''. When Bender explores the anomaly, his touch causes it to emit a [[shock wave]] that sends him and the ship flying. Farnsworth and Wernstrom discover that only living beings can pass through the anomaly; electrical objects such as robots are either repelled or destroyed. The two plan to initiate another expedition but are rejected in favor of a military assault on the anomaly led by [[Zapp Brannigan]].  Both Fry and Bender begin to feel lonely. Fry sneaks aboard Zapp's ship just before the ship takes off so that he can find solace on the other side of the anomaly. Bender attempts suicide, only to be approached by the League of Robots, a secret society of robots who like to blather about and tease humans, led by his hero Calculon. Bender becomes a prestigious member due to his perceived hatred of humans, although Calculon suspects that Bender is deceiving them.  Fry enters the anomaly while Kif is killed during Zapp's unsuccessful plan of attack. On the other side of the anomaly, Fry comes across a colossal, one-eyed, tentacled creature which begins forcing its appendages through the anomaly. The tentacles touch everyone in the universe, and nothing can stop them since they are made of electro-matter that can only be harmed by other electro-matter. Fry returns to Earth with a tentacle attached to the back of his neck and tells everyone to "love the tentacle." The tentacles attach themselves to nearly everyone, causing their victims to fall in love with it. With the influence spreading, Fry becomes the pope of a religion established to worship the tentacles.  Bender, meanwhile, believes that the League of Robots should uphold a strict anti-humans policy. When Calculon calls his bluff about hating humans, he challenges Calculon to a duel in which he cheats. This confrontation results in the loss of Calculon's arm and severe damage to much of the city. Calculon is outraged by Bender's behavior and resigns from the League, making Bender its new leader.  Leela ends up the last person in the universe unattached to a tentacle, after Zapp and Amy are taken over after Zapp seduces Amy. She examines a tentacle fragment and discovers that they are actually reproductive organs, revealing this to everyone at a universal religious gathering. The creature, named "Yivo", admits that mating with everyone in the universe was its original intention but explains that it is now truly in love with them. As a sign of good faith, Yivo resurrects Kif. Yivo began the relationship anew and removes its tentacles from everyone.  Yivo takes everyone in the universe out on a date at the same time, which goes extremely well. However, the universe's leaders feel that Yivo has made no commitment and sends a delegation to break up with it. Before they can do so, Yivo proposes marriage and they accept. Bender becomes fed up with being neglected by Fry and makes a deal with the [[List of recurring Futurama characters#Robot Devil|Robot Devil]] for an army of robots to take over the world, which happens in exchange for the death of Bender's first-born son. Before Bender can attack, humanity leaves Earth willingly to live on Yivo, along with the other civilizations of the universe, moving onto Yivo's body via golden escalators. This leaves Bender lonely once more and stagnates the robot population, who are built to serve humans. As the robots inherit Earth, everyone else promises never to make contact with other universes. Fry, however, cannot help writing a letter to Bender, which is sent without Yivo knowing. Yivo's body appears like a classic vision of [[Heaven]], with Angels really being harmless birds. Leela does not trust Yivo's motives at first, but when she sees that everyone is happy, she succumbs to her own loneliness and accepts Yivo.  Bender receives Fry's letter, which is made out of electro-matter, and decides to set out and "rescue" his friend from his relationship with Yivo. He and his army [[harpoon]] Yivo from the other side of the tear in space-time and tow it into their own universe where they are able to attack it. Fry convinces Bender to spare Yivo, but Yivo discovers that the robots' weapons are lined with the electro-matter from Fry's letter, allowing them to harm it. Since Fry broke his promise to never make contact with other universes, Yivo breaks up with the universe and makes everyone leave. While everyone else leaves aboard Bender's ship, Yivo finds consolation with Colleen, and they begin a relationship as they head back to the other universe together and close the anomaly, as Yivo cannot stay in the Universe due to the fact it would suffocate.  Fry decides to find love elsewhere and tries to ask Leela out, but she rejects him since he had already stopped trying once he met Colleen; Kif and Amy's relationship is strained due to Amy's affair with Zapp; and Farnsworth and Wernstrom go back to being archrivals. Bender breaks up his friends' quarrel and assures them that what they experienced was not love, as love is a jealous, hard-to-get emotion that does not share itself with the world. Bender shares his own love with Fry and Leela by giving them a big hug, which actually strangles them.

Meanwhile, [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] finds [[Cubert Farnsworth|Cubert]] and [[Dwight Conrad|Dwight]] playing ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' with their friends, but he cannot join in since, as a robot, he has no imagination. After several tries at imagining things, Bender manages to imagine himself as a medieval knight named "Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood" and enters the game. Unfortunately, he soon gets lost in his fantasy and goes on a rampage, resulting in his commitment to the [[Insane in the Mainframe|Hal Institute for Criminally Insane Robots]].  The crew learns that [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom]], who controls the world's only Dark Matter mine, is restricting the supply in order to drive up profits. The Professor reveals to the crew that while working for her many years ago, he stumbled on a way to turn dark matter from a useless curiosity into starship fuel. The process created two energy crystals, with Mom keeping one for herself and Farnsworth hiding the other, "anti-backwards" crystal. If the two crystals are brought together, they will render all dark matter useless. Farnsworth has forgotten where he hid his crystal, but it is being used as a [[Dice#Non-cubical dice|12-sided die]] in the kids' D&D game. Mom determines its location and sends her sons [[Mom (Futurama)#Sons|Walt, Larry and Igner]] to retrieve it, by saying that they are owl exterminators, but Farnsworth foils their attempt by sending an angry owl at them, messing up their plan since they do not know how to exterminate owls. Farnsworth, Fry, and Leela fly to Mom's mine with the crystal in order to neutralize the dark matter.  Reaching Mom's mine, the trio discovers the heart of the operation: thousands of captive [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Nibblonians|Nibblonians]], including  [[Nibbler (Futurama)|Nibbler]], being force fed chickens in order to collect their [[excrete]]d dark matter. Igner spots them, having earlier overheard Mom telling his brothers a secret about him, and helps them reach Mom's office. Farnsworth tries to bring his and Mom's crystals together, but swallows his in order to keep it out of Mom's hands.  In the robot asylum, Bender is diagnosed with insanity and is due for a "[[Lobotomy|Robotomy]]" in order to remove his imagination processor. The closeness of the two dark matter crystals triggers a resonance in all dark matter—including a stockpile Bender has stored within his body—and catapults all the characters into Cornwood, the realm Bender imagines himself to be from. The other members of the Planet Express crew ([[Hermes Conrad|Hermes]], [[Doctor Zoidberg|Zoidberg]], and [[Amy Wong|Amy]]) are transported as well.  [[Frodo Baggins|"Frydo"]] (Fry) and [[Legolas|"Leegola"]] (Leela, now a [[centaur]]) emerge first and encounter Titanius (Bender); no one in Cornwood has any memory of their real-world lives, except for Fry and Leela. The three are attacked by "Waltazar" (Walt), "Larius" (Larry) and "Ignus" (Igner), who are trying to recover the anti-backwards crystal. While fighting them off, Frydo drops the crystal, which rolls like a die and magically banishes the sons from the area to the Swamp [[Hag]]'s swamp. Frydo and company meet the wizard [[Gandalf|"Greyfarn"]] (Farnsworth), who explains that in this world, the anti-backwards crystal is known as the [[Rings of Power|Die of Power]]. The evil snake-haired sorceress [[Sauron|"Momon"]] (Mom) molded a set of powerful dice, but lost this one and has been trying to locate it so she can tap its immense potential. The only way to stop Momon is to enter her lair at the [[Mount Doom|Geysers of Gygax]] and throw the Die into the lake of molten [[plastic]] from which it was formed, destroying it.  As the group sets out, the [[intersex]], [[pacifist]] centaur "[[Hermaphrodite]]" (Hermes) bars their passage, since the centaurs are opposed to the violence that Frydo and company intend to do. However, (s)he is easily pushed aside by Leela, who leads everyone to the [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Cave of Hopelessness]]. As they approach, [[Galadriel|"Gynecaladriel"]] (Amy): Queen of the Water [[hypersexuality|Nymphos]] joins their quest and seduces the guard, enabling them to enter the Cave. Inside the Cave, a horde of [[Mork and Mindy|"Morcs"]] ([[orcs]]) attacks followed by a gigantic lobster creature (Zoidberg) which Leegola brutally cuts to pieces in a rage, and the wormlike [[Sandworm (Dune)|Tunneling Horror]] which Frydo defeats using the Die. As Frydo becomes [[Gollum|obsessed with the Die]], Leegola renounces violence after realizing Zoidberg was not the tunnelling horror, and flees to take refuge among the centaurs. That night, Frydo makes a botched attempt to murder the other members of the party; when foiled, he flees with the die.  The remaining travelers journey to [[White Castle (restaurant)|Wipe Castle]] to raise an army against Momon, only to find that [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Roberto|Roberto]], [[Denethor|its insane king]], has already sent his men on a pointless suicide mission. The heroes defend the kingdom alone as Waltazar and Larius lay siege to it, until Leegola regains her violent nature and rallies the centaurs to help her friends. Frydo makes his way into Momon's lair, aided by Zoidberg's still-living head; Frydo cannot bring himself to destroy the Die, so Zoidberg bites him to force him to drop it. Momon becomes a [[dragon]] and goes after the Die, but when it stops rolling, it turns Frydo into a dragon as well. The rest of the party arrives, along with Ignus, who reveals a secret Momon told his brothers: he is Greyfarn's son. Overwhelmed by this revelation, Greyfarn falls on the Zoidberg creature (who had claimed the Die), allowing Momon to seize the Die.  Cornwood collapses in on itself, hurling the characters back into the real world. With the crystal back in the Professor's stomach, Mom once again orders Walt and Larry to retrieve it. Before his moment of discomfort, the Professor requests a hug from Igner. Mom complies, saying someone should hug him as she never has. As the Professor had theorized, Igner had swallowed Mom's crystal in defiance and the hug brings the crystals in the two men's stomachs close enough to render all dark matter useless, breaking Mom's stranglehold on the fuel supply. As a temporary propulsion source, the crew harnesses dozens of Nibblonians to pull their ship home, which they call "Nibbler Power".  
Gaalipata
 Three childhood friends&nbsp;— Ganesh, an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] graduate; Diganth, a [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|medical]] student; and Kitty, an engineer, are caught by police for [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]] on a night in [[Bangalore]]. They use the influence of Ganesh's father, a legislator, to escape consequences. To cheer up Kitty after a breakup with his girlfriend and to free themselves, the three arrive at the house of Diganth's grandfather in Mugilpete.  Once there, they are introduced to and begin to stay at the guesthouse of Kodandaram, an avid hunter, the neighbor and friend of Diganth's grandfather. Kodandaram, now handicapped from a hunting accident and confined to a wheelchair, lives with his wife Padma, daughter-in-law Sowmya, and daughters Radha and Pavani. Sowmya is widowed and teaches the village children; Radha, a student of [[Ayurveda]], practices it alongside looking over the family's farming land; and Pavani is a student doing her [[pre-university course]]. Ganesh, a foodie, is fascinated with learning of Kodandaram's hunting spoils and persuades him to join them in hunting the very [[Indian boar|wild boar]] that left his legs crippled two years ago. At the forest, Kodandaram accidentally shoots Diganth in the chest, but is saved by a gong he had worn around his neck. They embark on another and final venture to kill the boar. As the boar approaches a rifle-wielding and wheelchair-bound Kodandaram, he gets up on his feet as an impulse and refuses to shoot it, thankful for bringing him back to his feet again, and calls it an incarnation of [[varaha]].  As days pass by, Diganth develops feeling towards Radha, who reciprocates, and Pavani towards Kitty, who falls in love with her as well. Kodandaram and Padma approve of their relationship and decide to fix their wedding. Ganesh, in love with Sowmya, first tries confessing his feelings for her in writing, on a kite which on flying accidentally unstrings and flies away. Dejected, and eager to marry her, he speaks to her, and despite having developed a liking for him, she refuses. She decides to take up an offer for a job with an NGO in Switzerland and leaves for the nearest airport, when Ganesh accompanies her. Wishing to fly kites with the village kids across the river one last time, they use a [[coracle]] to cross it. Just as Sowmya confesses her feelings for him, the coracle capsizes as they encounter a [[rapid]]. Ganesh saves her from drowning, when she professes her love for him.  
Frozen River
 The film is set shortly before Christmas in the [[North Country, New York|North Country]] of [[Upstate New York]], near the ''Akwesasne'' ('Where the Partridge Drums') [[St. Regis Mohawk Reservation]] and the border crossing to [[Cornwall, Ontario]]. Ray Eddy ([[Melissa Leo]]) is a [[discount store]] clerk struggling to raise two sons with her husband, a compulsive gambler who has disappeared with the funds she had earmarked to finance the purchase of a [[Mobile home|double-wide mobile home]]. While searching for him, she encounters Lila Littlewolf ([[Misty Upham]]), a [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo-parlor]] employee who is driving his car, which she claims she found abandoned with the keys in the ignition at the local [[bus station]]. The two women, who have both fallen on hard economic times, form a desperate and uneasy alliance and begin trafficking illegal immigrants from Canada into the United States across the frozen [[St. Lawrence River]] for $1,200 each.  Ray's older son T.J. wants to find a job and help support the family so they can afford to eat something more substantial than [[popcorn]] and [[Tang (drink)|Tang]]. He and his mother clash over whether he should remain in high-school and look after his little brother Ricky or drop out to work. To make matters worse, T.J. sets an outside corner of the trailer afire with a torch in an attempt to unfreeze the water pipe. Lila longs for the day she will be able to reclaim and live with her young son, who was taken from her by her mother-in-law immediately after his birth.  Because the women's route takes them from an [[Indian reservation]] in the US to an [[Indian reserve]] in Canada, they hope to avoid detection by local law-enforcement. However, their problems escalate when they are asked to smuggle a [[Pakistan]]i couple and Ray, fearful their [[duffel bag]] might contain explosives, leaves it behind in sub-freezing temperatures, only to discover it contained their infant baby when they arrive at their destination. She and Lila retrace their route and find the bag and the baby, which Lila insists is dead, but which she revives moments before being reunited with the baby's parents. The experience leaves her shaken, and she announces she no longer wants to participate in the smuggling operation. But Ray, needing just one more crossing to finance the down payment on her mobile home, coerces her into joining her for one last journey.  They pick up two  Asian women from a strip club for crossing. When the club owner tries to short them, Ray successfully threatens him with a gun. When she is re-entering her car, the irate club owner retaliates by shooting Ray in the ear. Shaken, her fast and erratic driving catches the attention of the provincial police. Ray tries to elude capture by crossing the frozen river where one of the wheels of the car breaks through the ice. The four women abandon the vehicle and take refuge at the Indian reservation.  Because the police are demanding a scapegoat, the tribal head decides to excommunicate Lila for five years due to her smuggling history which involved the death of her Mohawk husband. Surprised then saddened by the news, Ray gives in to Lila's pleas to go free for the sake of her children. However, running through the woods, Ray has a fit of conscience and returns. Ray gives her share of money to Lila with instructions for taking care of her (Ray's) sons and seeing through the purchase plans for a mobile home. Ray and the illegal immigrants are surrendered to the police and a trooper speculates she will have to serve four months in jail. Ray calls her son T.J. to explain what has happened.  Lila pushes her way into her mother-in-law's home and reclaims her infant son. She and the baby show up at the Eddy trailer while T.J. is still on the phone with his jailed mother. In a day scene, T.J. completes the welding of a bicycle-propelled carousel bearing his younger brother and Lila's strapped in baby. He pedals the carousel while Lila smiles on. A truck nears carrying the new mobile home.  
A Frozen Flower
  The King ([[Joo Jin-mo]]) of [[Goryeo]] is married to a [[Yuan Dynasty]] princess ([[Song Ji-hyo]]), but they do not have any children. There is constant pressure on the King both from the Yuan emperor and his own counselors to produce a crown prince and ensure the continuity of the royal dynasty. The King's palace guard is composed of thirty six young soldiers, led by military commander Hong-rim ([[Jo In-sung]]), who is also the King's lover. The King finally decides to charge Hong-rim with a strange commission: to impregnate the Queen by sleeping with her. Hong-rim and the Queen are uncomfortable accepting the royal order, but they finally comply. However, their relationship does not stop at [[Reproduction|procreation]], but an intense romance soon blossoms between the two, and in this strong [[intimate relationship]] there is no place for the King.  The two passionate lovers surpass their "official mission" and continue to meet each other at midnight in the library in secret. The King begins to suspect Hong-rim's infidelity and soon gains evidence through his junior commander. To punish them and to also gauge the depth of Hong-rim's affection for the Queen, the King calls the two together to his chamber. The king tells them that he has decided that the Queen will continue to try and beget an heir, but only with another subordinate. The King remains firm in his decision, despite entreaties from both the Queen and Hong-rim.  In despair, the Queen attempts to kill herself by slitting her wrists, but fails. In a last-ditch effort to change the King's mind, Hong-rim asks the Queen to stay away from him, and goes to the King to offer his own life in exchange for forgiveness. The King pardons him, believing Hong-rim's claim that his involvement with the Queen was purely lust. He decides to overlook everything that had happened, and instead orders Hong-rim to go away for a while to clear his mind and settle his emotions.  The night before Hong-rim's departure, the Queen's personal maid secretly informs him that the Queen wishes to meet him one last time. She also bears news that the Queen has finally conceived a child. Hong-rim sneaks out from the King's bedside to meet the Queen in the library. They end up making [[passionate love]] in the library, but the King realizes what is happening and catches them [[in flagrante delicto]]. When the two lovers attempt to save each other by begging the King to kill them and not the other, the King realizes how strong their [[romantic love]] for each other is. In a jealous rage, he has Hong-rim [[Castration|castrated]] and sent to prison.  The Queen now realises that the King will eliminate everyone who knows their secret, so she sends her maid to warn Hong-rim's loyal subordinates, and they manage to free Hong-rim from prison and flee the city with him.  Upon learning of the escape, the King demands to know Hong-rim's whereabouts from the Queen, but she refuses to answer. In response, he kills her maid. The King is then informed that the Queen is pregnant, and as the Queen had predicted, he then orders the execution of everyone who knows that he is not the child's father. Only his junior commander, who took over from Hong-rim, is spared.  Some time later, and having recovered from his wound, Hong-rim realizes that the Queen is still in the palace and not on the run, as his subordinates were ordered to tell him. Furious, he starts out for the city on horseback, despite their protests, but then he stops in his journey, realizing how futile it would be. However, on returning to the refuge, he finds that his men have been tracked down and captured.  At the palace, the King tortures the subordinates to discover the whereabouts of Hong-rim, but they remain silent, so the King has them executed and their heads put up on posts on the palace gates, along with that of the Queen's maid. Her head bears the Queen's necklace, in order to trick Hong-rim into believing the queen is dead and forcing him to return to exact revenge. When Hong-rim returns to the city, he indeed becomes enraged by this sight and determines to kill the King. Disguising himself as a soldier, he enters the palace grounds during the celebrations for the soldier who came back from war and hides out, awaiting his chance to reach the King and kill him.  Meanwhile, as the King returns to his private quarters, he encounters the Queen, but he snubs her, and orders his junior commander to escort her back to her room. As the commander is about to leave the Queen's chamber, she warns him that the King will surely have him killed as soon as the baby is born; she then says that if the commander assassinates the King, and her father takes over the throne, she will guarantee that his life will be spared. The junior commander then calls a meeting of his most trusted subordinates and reveals the truth about the King, the Queen and Hong-rim. However, before they can carry out the Queen's plan, Hong-rim goes into action.  Ignoring the palace guards, who plead with him to leave before he is captured and killed, he fights his way to the King's quarters, cutting down all who oppose him. Reaching the King's chamber, Hong-rim confronts the King and demands that he fight him. An intense duel ensues, during which Hong-rim slashes through the King's favourite painting, which depicts him and Hong-rim hunting together. As the desperate duel continues, the junior commander and his men arrive (their intentions not entirely clear), but the King orders them not to intervene, and the junior commander holds them back and awaits the outcome of the fight. At the climax of the duel, the King manages to break Hong-rim's sword, and stabs him in the shoulder. While Hong-rim is pinned by his sword, the King asks him a last question: whether or not Hong-rim had ever felt love for him. Hong-rim replies, "No". Hearing this, the King is shocked, giving Hong-rim time to throw himself forward on the blade and kill the King with the remaining half of his own sword.  As the King dies, Hong-rim staggers to his feet, pulls the King's sword from his shoulder and charges at the guards, but he is fatally stabbed by the junior commander. Moments later, the Queen arrives at the scene with the guards at her heels, who try to hold her back. Horrified, she tearfully calls out for Hong-rim. As she is taken away by the guards, Hong-rim realizes that the King had not killed her after all. He turns his head from her and dies facing the king, his eyes filled with realization of his test. The junior commander then declares that the King has been killed by an assassin, and he orders his men to quickly remove the bodies, and to tell no-one of what has transpired.  The final scenes of the film show a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to when the King showed young Hong-rim the view of the city and asked if Hong-rim wished to live with him, to which the young Hong-rim replied "Yes." The film ends on a montage of the King and Hong-rim happily hunting together, referring back to a dream the King once had, as depicted in the King's painting.  
The Gamers: Dorkness Rising
  The film opens with a trio of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' characters facing the final villain. However, they are quickly killed and after blaming each other, the players (Cass, Leo, and Gary) blame the game master, Lodge, claiming he did not follow the rules and plotted against them. While Leo and Gary wish to play a different game the following week, Cass demands to play the same campaign again, even though they just played it and lost for the second time, to preserve his reputation that there is no game he cannot win. Lodge wishes to publish his [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]] as an official ''Dungeons & Dragons'' [[adventure (role-playing games)|game module]], but he is having trouble writing it: he knows how he ''wants'' it to end, but his players never actually ''finish'' the module. Gary suggests that for the next game they bring in two more players, in order to have a more well-rounded party. Cass is able to recruit his ex-girlfriend Joanna, and quickly reveals why they split: Cass is overbearing and condescending, belittling Joanna's character design strategy (she chose several abilities that normally wouldn't be useful to her character).  The group has otherwise acquired an unfavorable reputation, and Lodge is unable to find anyone else, despite asking fifteen regular gamers.  The campaign begins when the characters Luster (Gary), Flynn the Fine (Leo), and Daphne (Joanna) are summoned before King Erasmus the Randomly Biased. The evil necromancer Mort Kemnon has discovered an artifact known as the Mask of Death and wishes to use this to overthrow the kingdom. As they go on their way, where Luster kills a random NPC while Daphne attempts to roleplay, they are summoned before the [[Hierophant]] of the Grand Illuminated Holy Order of Therin who sends two members of his order to accompany the party, Brother Silence (Cass) and Sir Osric (Lodge) -- the latter of whom the other players (with the exception of Joanna) take an instant dislike to, as Lodge created Osric just to keep the story on track. On their way, the group runs into a large party of goblins. The group (and Cass in particular) are surprised and embarrassed when Joanna's allegedly 'poorly designed' character single-handedly defeats the entire goblin party; Leo's bard is killed three times, however, which becomes a running joke throughout the remainder of the film.  Resting at an [[Public house#Inns|inn]] near Westhaven, the group faces and defeats Mort Agrippa. They head out for Westhaven and decide to stop playing for the night. Lodge explains to Joanna the reasons why he keeps the other players on such a short leash: if he does not, they will kill, plunder, and impregnate the fantasy world. The following week, the players continue the campaign by facing Drazuul in the town of Westhaven. Due to his character's weak traits, Leo goes through multiple copies of the character until the players are able to cleverly defeat Drazuul by hiding behind "the mound of dead bards". Torturing Drazuul with [[holy water]], they learn of Mort Kemnon's location.  Making their way through an abandoned mineshaft, they find a henchman from the previous campaign and recover their previous party's equipment. The battle goes poorly for the players, until Lodge's cat messes up the floor-tiles and Cass distracts Lodge while they place their characters in more preferable positions. After a lengthy battle with Kemnon (with Silence using a [[lightsaber]], [[shotgun]], [[chainsaw]], and [[dynamite]] which he claimed to have "found" in the trunk), Kemnon is defeated and cryptically implies there is another enemy. It is revealed to be the Hierophant, who intends to use the Mask to rekindle the Light of Therin. The group then realizes that the "Heart of Therin", the church's most sacred relic, is actually a prison housing the deity. During a battle with the Hierophant, Leo finally proves to be of use as he awakens Therin from her prison, allowing Daphne to release her (though Osric is killed in the encounter).  Afterwards, Daphne is offered an unlimited wish by Therin. After the other players recommend she wishes herself immortal, she uses it to resurrect Osric, much to the extreme disapproval of Cass, who insults her and storms out. The other three continue playing, and Therin provides rewards for each: Flynn becomes a herald, Luster is stripped of her powers and becomes a cleric, and Osric becomes Lord High Marshal of the Paladins. The campaign ends, and with positive comments from Gary and Leo, Lodge is inspired enough to write his module and has it published. Sometime later, Cass apologizes for his behavior and the group begins another adventure.  Lodge wants to send his group through the adventure module that another group was playing in the first ''Gamers'' film, but upon mentioning 'The Shadow', Mark - the lone survivor of that campaign — screams in fear and runs from the gaming store. As the new campaign begins with the Mask of Death having been stolen, the film ends showing the henchman still alone in the mine.

The Garden of Sinners: Paradox Spiral
  ===Shiki's arc=== In the middle of the night, Tomoe Enjo stabs his parents to death in a fit of rage, before escaping his apartment in a panic. Not long after, a homeless burglar finds their bodies, but when he returns with the police, to his surprise, he finds them being greeted by the residents in perfect health.  Sometime later, Shiki helps fend off some school bullies that were attacking Tomoe. Seemingly taken by Shiki's presence, he quickly asks her to help hide him, ecstatically claiming that he is a murderer. Shiki agrees, and simply cites she “is the same as him” when he is surprised by her easy acceptance of his status.  For the next month, Tomoe stays at Shiki's place, their life punctuated with Shiki's nightly sojourns, and Tomoe waiting for the news report of his parents' murder. During this time, Tomoe notices a strange man in a red hat and coat following Shiki. Tomoe warns her of this fact, which she idly dismisses. When they get into an argument over this, Tomoe claims he loves her, and as he lacks any worth, he'd be willing to die for her. Shiki refuses the offer, and asks him to consider where he feels his real home is. Tomoe feels then that he cannot hide any longer with Shiki, and leaves.  Not long after, Tomoe is shocked to see his mother still alive. Confused, he returns to Shiki. To confirm Tomoe's murder, Shiki accompanies him in returning to his residence at Ogawa apartment: an ominous, circular complex colored red, which was completed recently.  When they enter the elevator, Shiki notices they are ascending in a spiral. Reaching the 4th floor, Shiki insists on not ringing the doorbell, and simply entering Tomoe's home. Inside, they are met with Tomoe's abusive family, even another Tomoe, and watch the family's final moments as Tomoe's mother succumbs to murder-suicide. Shiki explains that these are simply imitation puppets that are revived in the morning and are forced to relive their final day alive repeatedly. Because Tomoe did not ring the doorbell, they continued to act as if they had no visitor.  Shiki then brings Tomoe to the opposite side of the apartment, his “real home”. She explains that when elevator began operating, due to the construction of the complex, none of the residents realized the rotating elevator made them exit 180 degrees, into another set of flats. When they enter Tomoe's original residence, they find the rotted corpses of the parents. This side of the apartment is used to store corpses. However, this intrusion also causes the undead puppets of the other deceased apartment residents to attack them when they exit. Shiki easily cuts them down, but afterwards she is confronted by Soren Araya. It is revealed in a short flashback that sometime during the second movie, Shiki had previously fought Soren.  Soren explains that he controls the apartment, as part of an experiment that uses the building to simulate a “miniature world that concludes in a day”. After driving all the occupants to kill one another, he has been making them repeat their deaths over the past half year, hoping for a deviation in their deaths. He also reveals that he was the one who manipulated Kirie and Fujino in the previous movies to attack Shiki, as antithesis to her, in hopes he can force her to recognize her own “Origin”. As they are meeting early, Soren decides to capture her now to reach the spiral of origin.  Shiki's mystic eyes are unable to perceive lines on Soren's body, due to his great age (his Origin being “Stillness”) and mystical artifacts he grafted onto his left arm in preparation. She attacks, regardless, even able to cut through his defenses, but in the end, she is defeated by Soren, and absorbed into the building.  Tomoe, the lone witness of all this, grabs Shiki's knife and escapes back to her home.  ===Mikiya's arc=== Toko receives a tip from a friend on the police force regarding a mysterious report made by a burglar that upon entering an apartment, he found a middle-aged couple murdered. However, when the police follow up and ring the doorbell of their apartment, the man who was seen dead by the burglar answers as if nothing was wrong. A particular interest is taken to Tomoe, the son of the couple, who is missing. Toko requests that Mikiya, who just returned from a month of driving school in the suburb to obtain his license, investigate the situation.  Mikiya finds the schematics of the strange apartment building, two separate semi-circular buildings that are separate apart from the lobby containing only one central elevator, and reports this to both Toko and Shiki. Apparently, the builder meant for the construction to be for a company dormitory, but instead opened it to the public. Mikiya also reports that the elevator was inoperable for the first month residents lived in the building and also manages to find background details on 30 of the 50 families residing within the building.  Mikiya is also given a katana by Shiki's family to deliver to her. Toko requests that she not assemble it within the office, as its age would cause all of the magical barriers to break. Mikiya also makes arrangements to meet Shiki, but is surprised to find her apartment locked, although there was never a lock on the door in the past.  Toko and Mikiya set out and investigate the building, Toko reveals that she helped design it and there is a reason only 30 of the 50 family backgrounds could be found, the others were faked using certificates of already deceased people. Mikiya is automatically affected by the strange building's architecture and design, which Toko explains were purposely designed in that manner to make the residents go insane. As Mikiya exits the elevator on the 4th floor, he is confused to find himself on the wrong side of the building than the blueprints noted, and is further confused when he checks on the residents of apartment 405, Tomoe's family, and finds them there, although they are supposed to be living in the opposite building in apartment 410. When asked by Toko to meet him one flight up the stairs, Mikiya is surprised to find that he arrived on the 6th floor instead of the 5th, although seemingly only going up one floor of the building. Toko tells him the confusion is due to the elevator rotating 180 degrees while lifting and augmentation to the stairway, which Mikiya deduces as pistons raising the stairwell one level, therefore effectively "switching" the apartments of the residents to the other half of the building after the completion of the elevator.  Mikiya then visits Shiki's apartment again but finds Tomoe there instead. He tells Tomoe that he is going to look for the now missing Shiki and questions Tomoe on his motives for helping to rescue Shiki. Mikiya brings Tomoe with him on the condition they make one stop first, despite disagreeing with Tomoe's sentiments that this is something he is just doing for Shiki's sake. Mikiya surprises Tomoe by bringing him to his childhood home where Tomoe regains his memories and realizes that he "has a home" and will fight for his own sake, not Shiki's. During the flashback, we learn that Tomoe's key was important to him because his father told him that it was a symbol of how the members of their family protected each other.  Mikiya and Tomoe proceed to the apartment complex to rescue Shiki. They separate before entering, deciding to take separate routes, and agree to never search for each other again after parting so that neither one would feel guilty if something happened to the other. After bidding farewell to Tomoe, Mikiya enters the building and is confronted by Cornelius, a Magus from Toko's past, who assumes Mikiya is Toko's apprentice. Although Mikiya manages to stab Cornelius, it does no good. Cornelius superimposes his hatred for Toko on to Mikiya, even acting as if he were Toko, while slamming his head into a wall continuously, knocking Mikiya unconscious.  ===Final arc=== Toko arrives before Mikiya and Tomoe, but is killed in battle. Her head is kept alive in a jar temporarily, but Cornelius insists on killing her himself. Cornelius leaves the basement with Toko's head in tow. He meets Mikiya, who is heading in the front entrance as a distraction for Tomoe. Meanwhile, Tomoe has snuck into the underground lab, where he finds his brain in a jar and confronts Soren, whose organs are hardwired into the building—his "body" is a puppet. Tomoe heads to the tenth floor, where Shiki is, bringing the katana from earlier. Tomoe stabs Soren in the heart but Soren kills him, but he sees a blurry figure that looks like Shiki in front of Soren just before he dies.  Toko arrives again, explaining to Cornelius that she had made a puppet that was an exact copy of herself. Cornelius realizes that killing her old body was the trigger that awakened the new one. Toko kills Cornelius, and is confronted by Soren as she is tending to Mikiya's head injury. Soren asks whether Toko intends to oppose him; she replies that she had already lost, when she died. She says that the one who would stop him would be Shiki. Then she guesses Soren's real purpose regarding the apartment complex by representing the Taiji in order to take in the Taiji (using Shiki (yin) to get into the Spiral of Origin and end the world). Soren replied yes and says he has sealed her outside of space, which incites Toko to laugh derisively. She explains that he would have been better off sealing her in concrete, as no such barrier would hold Shiki for long. As if on cue, Shiki arrives with the katana to duel with Soren and Shiki finally kills him. As Soren dissolves slowly, he discusses with Toko his reason for ending the world is that he wanted the records of the deaths of all humans and a conclusion to his deed. With that he achieves happiness for giving meaning to meaningless deaths of the human race.  We see a sequence with Shiki and Tomoe as each other's mirror images as these represent two sides of the Taiji; it is not clear whether this is real or imagined. The credits roll.  After the credits, Mikiya arrives at Shiki's apartment, and uses the key Tomoe had given him to get inside. Shiki remarks that it is unfair that she doesn't have a key to his apartment.<ref name="The Anime Review"></ref>  
The Garden of Sinners: Oblivion Recording
 The movie starts off with an introduction from Kokuto Azaka on who she is and how she plans to win Mikiya over as her lover despite the presence of a dangerous woman named Ryogi Shiki. Afterwards, Shiki is sent to Azaka's school, the Reien Academy, during winter break in order to help investigate a series of reports of fairies stealing the student's memories, and a suspicious suicide. The two immediately clash as Azaka is in love with her brother (Mikiya) and considers Shiki a love rival.  While walking around the school, Shiki notices a fairy, and chases after it. Azaka, who cannot see the fairies, is left alone and is attacked by an unknown person and has her memory stolen, only waking up in the evening with no memory of what has occurred. They discover the magus using the fairies is trying to erase everyone's memories of the event, but the school has a written record of the investigation.  Azaka goes alone to check out the suicide site in the old building, as Shiki does not want to wake up this early. While there, Oji finds her and requests that Azaka pray with her in the chapel. After praying, she reveals she is the one using the fairies to erase everyone's memories, and that she killed Hideo Hayama (the teacher who went missing) and used his body to create the fairies (as you need a corpse of some kind to create a familiar). She then tries to erase Azaka's memory. Azaka is knocked unconscious from behind by one of the fairies, but she retains her memory and is found by Satsuki Kurogiri, the teacher replacing Hideo Hayama.  Shiki arrives and tells Azaka that the students of Kaori's class have all disappeared. Azaka says she is going to check out the suicide site, but Kurogiri strangely tells her that there is nothing there, and upon arriving there, she finds that a large section of the building has mysteriously disappeared without a trace. Unable to find a trace of Oji, Azaka falls asleep, and is woken up some time later by the dog left by her roommate. Shiki tells her that she has a message from Mikiya, who informs her of Kurogiri's real identity, that of a magus known as "God's Word" and a counter measure to his ability, as well as the cause of Hideo Hayama's death.  Taking Shiki's walkman and earphones in order to ignore his words, Azaka runs past Kurogiri without being affected by his ability, and heads to the suicide site to discover all the students there in a trance, with lighted matches and open canisters of fuel, Oji intending for them to commit suicide in the same manner as Kaori. Azaka and Oji face off in the chapel, while Shiki faces off with Kurogiri. Azaka tries to convince Oji to stop, revealing that Hayama died from a heart attack due to his drug abuse, that the information she gained from the fairies was just a rumour circulated by the students, and Kurogiri had stolen her memory first to make her come to the wrong conclusion. Oji refuses to stop, and tries to kill her with the fairies, but eventually they rebel against her, and Azaka destroys them and the source of the magic.  Kurogiri reveals that Araya Soren requested he return to Japan in order to restore Shiki's memory, and Shiki tries to kill him, but Kurogiri simply says "You'll lose sight of me" and Shiki becomes unable to see him. After everything is settled, Mikiya tells Azaka that Kaori regained consciousness in the hospital. The bus arrives, but instead of getting on, Azaka pulls Mikiya away and insists on a date in order to make up for him going out with Shiki the other day (Movie 3, Mikiya is supposed to meet Azaka but sends Shiki to tell her he can't make it). At night, Azaka remembers a dream from her childhood, and remembers why and how she fell in love with Mikiya.  The restoration of Shiki's memory via God's Word as well as what happened to him after the events of the movie are left unexplained, though in the original novel much more about him is touched upon and he is killed by one of his students in a considerably karmic fashion.

Garfield's Fun Fest
 Garfield and his friends enter a talent contest and after various exertions and adventures and win it.  Although the script lacks literary depth and the film garnered no important accolades or serious critical notice, it does contain elements of the [[meta-story]] (the film opens with one of the characters reading a story; a character from that story later appears in the main exposition, and is ultimately revealed to be the narrator of the entire film, itself merely a story), [[metatheatrical]] overtones (the characters [[Self-awareness#In theater|inhabit a comic strip and are aware of it]]), and the [[Quest|quest motif]] (the protagonist, Garfield, must travel through strange lands, overcome various obstacles, and achieve transformative wisdom to attain his goal).  
Gasolina (film)
 The film tells a story of three middle-class teenagers on a high-octane ride to hell outside the safety of their colonia. They siphon [[gas]] from their neighbors cars and roam the streets, looking for any and every form of entertainment, but they soon learn that even the simplest actions can have consequences way beyond anything they imagined, and some lessons are learned too late.   
Gardens of the Night
 In Pennsylvania, at the age of eight, a girl named Leslie Whitehead ([[Ryan Simpkins]]) is kidnapped by Alex ([[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]]) and Frank ([[Kevin Zegers]]). Alex says he needs help finding his dog, then he and Frank take her to school. While driving, Alex tells Leslie her dad is their boss, thus earning her trust. After school, Alex and Frank find her again. They lure her into their car with a story about her dad being in trouble, drug her and take her to their house. Alex tells Leslie her parents do not want her anymore. As proof, he provides the number to her "dad's cell phone," which, in reality, is a pay phone. After several unanswered calls, she eventually accepts his story.  She and another victim, a young boy named Donnie, are forced into prostitution and pornography. Their clients include men in positions of authority, such as a judge. As a coping mechanism, Donnie and Leslie pretend they are in an imaginary world based on the stories of [[Mowgli]] and [[The Jungle Book]]. One day, Leslie goes to a convenience store, where it becomes apparent her parents are looking for her because her picture is on milk cartons. However, Leslie doesn't see the cartons, thus preserving her notion that her parents don't want her. While Alex is paying for ice cream, the store owner's wife recognizes her as missing and calls the police. When the police show up at Alex and Frank's house, they hastily escape with the children.  Almost nine years later, Leslie ([[Gillian Jacobs]]) and Donnie ([[Evan Ross]]) are living together on the streets of San Diego, prostituting themselves and stealing. As a way for her to be "independent" and get off the streets, a pimp named Cooper ([[Shiloh Fernandez]]) tries to convince Leslie to lure a twelve-year-old girl, Monica, living at a youth shelter into prostitution. Meanwhile, Donnie has fallen in love with Leslie, but she's unsure because, presumably, she's always just seen him as her brother. She ends up deciding to leave Donnie and goes to the shelter to "turn out" the girl. When Donnie goes looking for Leslie, Cooper tells him she's left him, devastating him. At the last minute, Leslie decides not to turn out Monica and returns her to the shelter. She tries to go back to Donnie, but finds out he has left town without saying where he was going. Having no other choice, Leslie goes back to the shelter to stay. A counselor there ([[John Malkovich]]) discovers Leslie is a missing person and tells her her parents have been looking for her all these years, which she finally realizes is true.  Leslie reunites with her parents, along with two siblings born during her absence, and attempts to "return home." However, she is too traumatized after all she's been through and cannot remain in such a normal atmosphere. She leaves in the middle of the night and starts to hitchhike, hoping to find Donnie again. Donnie is shown hitchhiking through Florida, the location of an amusement park where he and Leslie, as children, said they would meet if they ever got separated.

The demands of composition of his new symphony, the ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Schumann)|Rhenish Symphony]]'', leads to tension between him and Clara.  A little later Brahms introduces a couple of his own compositions to the Schumanns and they are impressed by his compositional and pianistic skills. Allowing him to stay with them, Brahms lovingly cares for their children. Robert's work on the Rhenish Symphony continues to suffers and he struggles with an addiction to the drug [[laudanum]], on which he is soon dependent.

Robert tries in vain to take his own life, by jumping into the [[Rhine|River Rhine]], but accepts the offer of Dr. Richartz to be a patient at his sanatorium at [[Endenich]] in Bonn. Brahms returns to help Clara to care for children. The two tour together to raise money for the family, while Robert is a patient at the Institute. Eventually Clara and Brahms travel to Bonn, to say a final farewell.

The Garden of Sinners: Remaining Sense of Pain
 A teenaged girl, Fujino Asagami, is being raped by a street gang in an abandoned bar. One night, Mikiya finds a confused Fujino crouched in an alley and noticing she is suffering from pain in her abdomen. Mikiya brings her to his apartment where she falls asleep. The next morning, Mikiya notices Fujino is gone, and at the same time, the news reports a murder scene in an abandoned underground bar where the victims' corpses were found with their limbs torn off.  Later, inside Toko's office, Mikiya rants to Toko about not having his monthly salary paid because she spent her money on a Victorian ouija board. Toko talks to Shiki about the murder scene and asks Shiki to capture a suspected perpetrator per a client's request. Shiki, confident she will recognize the suspect because of their killing intentions, leaves without reading the suspect's background information. Shiki claims they will try to kill each other the moment they meet.  Mikiya asks his friend Gakutō to lend him money. Gakutō accepts, but in return asks Mikiya to help him find Keita Minato, a friend who was acquainted with Mikiya during his high school days. Fujino is shown dialing Keita's phone, but Keita does not answer while he is cowering frightened. Later, elsewhere, Fujino is dismembering someone without actually touching him while asking for Keita's location. In another scene, Mikiya's sister, Azaka Kokuto, is chatting with Fujino in a cafe and Shiki approaches Azaka to tell her Mikiya will not come to see her. Shiki notices Fujino and stares at her with killing intent, but Fujino does not respond. Thus, Shiki does not recognize Fujino as the suspect at that time.  Some nights later, Fujino is dismembering another victim (In the novels, the victim was a friend of Keita who tricked Fujino saying he knew where she could find Keita, but in reality he wanted to rape her). The moment Fujino kills him, Shiki appears to confront her stating that Fujino is similar to her because of her bloodthirst. As Shiki and Fujino get ready to fight, a sudden change in Fujino's character occurs that makes Shiki no longer desire a fight and leaves. A flashback in Fujino's childhood reveals her playing with a knife along with her toys, seemingly injured and bleeding. However, she continued playing as if she did not feel any pain. Back to the present, Fujino calls Keita's number, saying she is finally feeling pain and therefore feeling alive. But she does not want Keita, the only survivor of the bar's crime scene, to tell everyone she is a murderer, as she wants to live normally, and speaks of her intent to kill him.  Mikiya was with Keita listening to Fujino's phone call. Keita reveals he and his friends have gang raped Fujino for some time, but she did not show any signs of pain or emotion except recently when she was hit in the lower back by one of Keita's friends. Mikiya is disgusted by how Keita and his gang treated Fujino, but he still helps him by bringing him back to Toko's office for protection.  Mikiya then intends to talk to Fujino to stop her quest of revenge. Toko tells him that Keita confessed that his friend stabbed Fujino in her abdomen on the night of the murders and that actually triggered her desire to kill. However, Shiki, when she first met Fujino, noticed she did not have any wounds. She states that the pain is still inside Fujino's body, and she would resort to killing to relieve the pain. Mikiya leaves to investigate Fujino's past.  One night, a driver is about to accidentally crash into Fujino, but is murdered before that happens. Shiki decides she must stop Fujino. A flashback scene shows that Fujino, with an injured leg, once met Mikiya years ago. As Fujino does not feel any pain, Mikiya thinks she is hiding her pain and tells her that pain is something that needs to be spoken about.  Mikiya discovers that initially, Fujino was able to feel pain, but her father (revealed to be her step father in the novels) artificially sealed her ability to feel pain in order to suppress her telekinetic powers. Toko then deduces that Fujino was never stabbed in the first place, but she was indeed feeling pain the moment she was about to be stabbed. Her real pain is caused by an untreated and ruptured appendix, and Toko concludes Fujino does not have much time left to live.  Shiki confronts Fujino on a newly constructed bridge that is sealed off, this time both wishing to defeat one another since Fujino can feel pain and joy from killing. During the fight, Shiki's left arm is twisted and rendered useless by Fujino's power. After constantly fleeing from Fujino's attacks, Shiki is finally able to 'see' through her telekinesis and able to 'cut' them with her 'Mystic Eyes of Death Perception'. Just before being delivered the final blow, Fujino uses her acquired 'clairvoyance' to destroy the entire bridge without the need to actually see her surroundings. An injured and agonizing Fujino tries to escape, realizing her desire to live and love towards Mikiya (and in the novels, her mother). She is found by Shiki who bends down and stabs her.  Mikiya and Toko find Shiki outside of the bridge, who tells them Fujino lost her sensitivity to pain in the end and lost the desire to kill her. Instead, Shiki cut through Fujino's illness. Toko tells Shiki she will replace her left arm with a puppet arm capable of grasping spiritual embodiments. Mikiya calls a medical team to treat Fujino.  In the end, Mikiya confesses to Shiki that he is concerned about Fujino, whose acts will haunt her mind and continue hurting her. Despite the terrible things she had done, she was more human than the gang who abused her. Mikiya also confesses he will stay by Shiki's side, by which Shiki also confesses she feels a small, 'special' murderous intent towards Mikiya'.<ref name="The Anime Review"></ref>

Get Smart (film)
 Maxwell "Max" Smart, an analyst for the top secret American intelligence agency, CONTROL, yearns to become a [[field agent]] like his idol, Agent 23. Despite top scores in the acceptance tests, Max is denied the promotion due to his higher value as an analyst. When CONTROL headquarters is attacked by the terrorist organization KAOS, almost all of CONTROL's agents' identities are exposed, leaving only Agent 99 as a viable field operative. Max is also promoted to field agent as Agent 86, but the experienced 99 is reluctant to partner with him because of his inexperience.  On the first day of his job, Max receives a Swiss army knife which includes special add-ons like a miniature flamethrower and a crossbow that shoots darts attached to spider web thread.  While on a plane, Agent 99 spots a threatening looking man in the back and says she thinks he's an assassin. Max brushes it off as profiling and notices that he has a wad of gum stuck to the bottom of his shoe and attempts to scrape it off using a match. Passengers around him start to yell and panic, thinking he is trying to light his shoe, and that it must be a bomb. He is tackled by an Air Marshal and his hands are put into zip ties. Max requests to use the bathroom, and while inside attempts to break his zip ties using the crossbow on his pocketknife. He does finally break the zip tie, but one of the darts hits the "eject" button and leaves him plummeting towards the earth with no parachute.  Agent 99 goes to eject. She sees the dart and that there are still two parachutes there. She realizes what happened and quickly ejects to save Max. She grabs him, but the threatening man follows close behind. He slashes 99's chute with a large knife.  99 does not panic, knowing she has a backup chute. She briefly lets go of Max to slash the man's chute. However, he grabs onto her and Max and prevents her from being able to pull her parachute. She kisses him, and, shocked, he lets go. 99 pulls her parachute, and the man plummets through the roof of a farm. 99 and Max assume he is dead, but 99 is irritated with Max's incompetence.  The two arrive at the mansion of KAOS' chief bomb-maker, Ladislas Krstic. Max accidentally inhales a tranquilizer that he meant to shoot at the guards. When he wakes up, he is in entirely new clothes, a disguise chosen by 99. They infiltrate the main office and trace nuclear material to a KAOS nuclear weapons factory disguised as a [[Moscow]] bakery. In the bakery, Max meets with KAOS boss Siegfried and his second-in-command, Shtarker, only to learn that a double-agent has compromised their identities. Max manages to escape and destroy the weapons factory, but he and 99 are confronted by the same man that they had assumed dead earlier. All seems lost, but Max manages to persuade Dalip to spare their lives. He does this by talking to Dalip about his crumbling relationship, realizing he knows all about the man after tracking him while he had been working as an analyst.  The Chief sends 23 to observe the cleanup of the factory, but KAOS sneaks the weapons out through the Moskva River beforehand, leaving 23 convinced that only a bakery had been destroyed. Realizing that Max was alone during his key discoveries, CONTROL believes Max to be the double-agent. 99, who has been gradually falling in love with Max, is heartbroken but takes Max into custody.  Siegfried contacts the U.S. government and threatens to release nuclear weapon detonator codes to hostile countries unless he is paid a ransom of $200 billion. When his threats are not taken seriously, KAOS plans to detonate a nuclear bomb in [[Los Angeles]]. While Max is in a CONTROL holding cell, Dalip sends him a coded message via the radio show ''[[American Top 40]]'' alerting him to Siegfried's plan. Max escapes; arrives in Los Angeles to reunite with the Chief, 99, and 23; and convinces them that he is not the double-agent. When his [[Geiger counter]]-equipped watch picks up traces of radiation from 23, they realize 23 is the real double-agent.  23 takes 99 hostage and flees in a vehicle. After a chase, Max manages to rescue 99, but in the struggle, the car is set on fire and forced onto railroad tracks. Max kisses 23 to distract him, a trick learned from 99. He and 99 are thrown off the vehicle before it collides with a freight train, killing 23. After analyzing 23's [[nuclear football]], Max realizes that the bomb will be triggered by the final note of [[Ludwig von Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s "[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ode to Joy]]". They rush to the [[Disney Hall]], and Max tackles the elderly [[conducting|conductor]] just before the final note, saving the President and Los Angeles. Siegfried, despite his plan failing, is satisfied with Dalip's performance and promises not to kill his wife in response, but insults her at the same time. In response, Dalip throws Siegfried into a river.  Back in CONTROL headquarters, a party is held in Max's honor, where 99 gives him a puppy. Max is afterwards given honors and gets his dream of becoming a real spy. While leaving, Max attempts to fix the jammed door, much to 99's dismay, and ends up jammed between the sliding doors as a humorous ending shot.

Ghost Town (2008 film)
 The film begins as married [[New York City]] businessman Frank Herlihy ([[Greg Kinnear]]) is accidentally killed while trying to buy an apartment for his mistress. Shortly afterward, [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] dentist Bertram Pincus ([[Ricky Gervais]]) has a [[near-death experience]] while under general anesthetic during a [[colonoscopy]]. When he recovers, he is able to see and communicate with [[ghost]]s who populate the area. The ghosts annoy Bertram by asking him to help them with personal business that was left unfinished when they died. Frank promises to keep the other ghosts away if Bertram will break up an engagement between Frank's widow Gwen (Leoni), a professional [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]], and Richard ([[Billy Campbell]]), a human-rights lawyer who Frank says is dishonest.  Bertram eventually agrees to the deal and tries to woo Gwen away from Richard. Bertram's past rudeness to Gwen makes this difficult, but he attracts her interest by analyzing the teeth of a [[mummy|mummified]] Egyptian Pharaoh that she has been studying.  When Bertram has dinner with Gwen and Richard, he decides that Richard is not as bad as Frank claimed, but Bertram himself begins to fall in love with Gwen, and she enjoys Bertram's sense of humor. At another dinner, Gwen reveals that she learned of Frank's mistress the day he died, and when Richard visits Bertram for some dental work, Bertram drugs him with [[nitrous oxide|laughing gas]] in order to make him reveal that Gwen has broken their engagement. Frank doesn't understand why he is still on Earth if his "unfinished business" was to break up Richard and Gwen.  Gwen, not being engaged to Richard any longer, says yes to a work proposal that would send her to the [[Valley of the Kings]] in Egypt for six months. As a going-away present, Bertram gets her a new [[key chain]] from a fancy jeweler's, as she had earlier mentioned that she desperately needed one. But when he mistakenly reveals information about Gwen that only Frank could have known, she demands the truth, and Bertram tells her the whole story about the ghosts. Gwen doesn't believe him and demands to know what Frank's worst nightmare was. Frank lies to Bertram, telling him a fake nightmare, and Gwen, thinking that Bertram has been lying to her and playing some kind of game, walks away and cuts him off. Bertram demands to know why Frank lied to him about the nightmare, and Frank points out that Bertram only cares about his own needs.  Bertram sinks into a [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and asks a fellow dentist ([[Aasif Mandvi]]), for medication that will help him forget Gwen. His colleague instead convinces him that his life would be better if he decided to stop being selfish and start helping people. Bertram begins helping the ghosts around him with their "unfinished business" on Earth, bringing comfort to people they left behind and enabling the ghosts to depart. As he does this he realizes that the ghosts were still on Earth not because ''they'' had unfinished business, but because the people they were close to were not finished with them. He begins to appreciate life and the people he encounters.  Bertram realizes that the reason Frank cannot leave is that Gwen has not let go of him yet. He confronts Gwen who asks him to ask Frank why she wasn't enough for him, and Frank says he's sorry for hurting her, which Bertram tells Gwen. Gwen is incredulous that after his infidelity, all Frank would have to say was 'sorry' and thinks that Bertram is making it all up. He rushes after her and while trying to persuade her to believe him, gets hit by a bus. Bertram, now a ghost himself, watches with Frank as people crowd around his body and Gwen sobs over him. Richard arrives on his way to the reception and tries to revive Bertram with prayer and CPR. Seeing how distraught Gwen is, Frank gives Bertram 'some advice' that will be useful in case he is resuscitated, and tells him that Gwen's tears are for Bertram, in other words she loves him. After saying this, Frank is finally allowed to leave the earthly plane.  Bertram wakes up alive in the hospital. Later Gwen, who needs dental work, comes in for an appointment with another dentist but finds Bertram's office to say hello. Bertram tells Gwen of Frank's real nightmare—that of losing his way home, which was the advice Frank told him, and then assures her that Frank has 'found his way home.' The movie ends with Gwen saying, "It hurts when I smile", to which Bertram replies "I can fix that for you".<ref name=Ghost />

Ghajini (2008 film)
 Sunita ([[Jiah Khan]]) is a medical student working on a project about the human brain with her classmates. When she was denied access by her professor to the curious case of Sanjay Singhania ([[Aamir Khan]]), a man reported to have [[anterograde amnesia]], because it is under criminal investigation, Sunita decides to investigate the matter herself.  It is later revealed that Sanjay loses his memory every 15 minutes. He uses a system of photographs, notes, and tattoos on his body to recover his memory after each cycle to remind himself of his mission: to avenge the death of his girlfriend Kalpana ([[Asin]]). He systematically kills the people who were involved in the murder. His main target is Ghajini Dharmatma ([[Pradeep Rawat (actor)|Pradeep Rawat]]), a notable social personality in the city, and the man directly responsible for Kalpana's death and Sanjay's condition.  Police inspector Arjun Yadav ([[Riyaz Khan]]) tracks Sanjay down to his apartment and knocks him unconscious. Yadav finds two diaries in which Sanjay has chronicled the events of 2005 and 2006. The film flashes back to 2005 as Yadav reads the diary. Sanjay Singhania is the chairman of the Air Voice mobile telephone company. In the course of business, he sends his men to meet Kalpana, a struggling model of Mumbai, about putting up a billboard above her apartment. The owner of Kalpana's advertising firm misinterprets this as a romantic advance and, in view of a possible lucrative Air Voice ad campaign, encourages Kalpana to accept the overture. Kalpana thinks of it as an innocent prank that may fetch her better modelling work and decides to act as Sanjay's girlfriend. Sanjay goes to confront Kalpana about this but falls in love with her at first sight. He hides his identity and introduces himself as Sachin, and the two begin spending time together. The diary ends with Sanjay proposing to Kalpana and promising himself that he will reveal his actual identity if she accepts.  When Yadav is about to read the 2006 diary, Sanjay awakes and attacks him, tying him up. Ghajini realizes that someone is trying to kill him but is unable to figure out who. Sunita visits Sanjay's flat and discovers Sanjay's plan to kill Ghajini. She takes both his diaries before finding Yadav, beaten and bound, and freeing him. Just then, Sanjay arrives, he remembers neither of them and chases them out. Yadav is hit by a bus as he flees in terror, and Sunita, believing Ghajini is the good guy in danger, informs him about Sanjay. Ghajini arrives at Sanjay's flat and destroys all of Sanjay's photographs and notes, as well as the tattoos on Sanjay's body, so that Sanjay is left with nothing to help him recover his memory.  Meanwhile, Sanjay discovers that Sunita had warned Ghajini and he goes to her dormitory to kill her, but Sunita calls the police and Sanjay is arrested. Back in her dormitory as Sunita reads the diaries, the film flashes back to 2006, where it is revealed that Kalpana had accepted Sanjay's proposal. When this diary ends abruptly, Sunita investigates further and discovers that Kalpana was travelling to [[Goa]] for a modelling assignment when she came upon 25 innocent young girls being trafficked. She had saved the girls with the help of some army soldiers on board, who named Ghajini as the ringleader of the racket. Outraged, Ghajini broke into Kalpana's apartment with his goons to kill her. When Sanjay arrived, he found Kalpana stabbed. Ghajini then hit Sanjay over the head with an iron rod. Sanjay's last sight was Ghajini brutally murdering Kalpana with the iron rod. Kalpana's last word to Sanjay was "Ghajini."  Sunita, now aware of the shocking truth, finds Sanjay in the hospital and tells him the truth. He flies into a heartbroken rage and tracks down Ghajini with Sunita's help. He fights off all of Ghajini's henchmen with a superior and anger-fueled strength. Ghajini, upon realizing Sanjay is too strong for him, flees. Sanjay's memory loss strikes again, and he forgets who Ghajini is. Ghajini takes this opportunity to stab Sanjay and taunt him with the grisly tale of how he murdered Kalpana. As he is about to make Sanjay relive the experience by killing Sunita in the same exact way, Sanjay recovers the memory of Kalpana's murder, and overpowers Ghajini in a flash of strength. He finally kills Ghajini, in the same way Ghajini had killed Kalpana.  The film ends 6 months later, with a still-amnesiac Sanjay who is once again the CEO of AirVoice and is volunteering at an orphanage named after Kalpana. Sunita gives him a gift that reminds him of his bond, with Kalpana, and Sanjay sees Kalpana by his side. Sanjay is finally at peace with himself.

Gingerdead Man 2: Passion of the Crust
 Kelvin Cheatum ([[K-von Moezzi]]) is trying to save his father's studio from bankruptcy by producing worthy heirs to his father's slate of classic low-budget cult films. Cheatum Studio's current productions include ''Hamburger Time Traveler Detective'', ''Space Spankers 2015'', and the ninth entry of his father's famous killer puppet franchise ''Tiny Terrors''; however, things aren't going as planned: the cast and crew members are losing patience with the long hours, lack of pay, terrible scripts, and Kelvin's over reliance on good will towards his father. A blogger who goes by the name of "Demon Warrior 13" is organizing effective boycotts of their films.   A puppet exploding during a shot has brought matters to a head and an open brawl has broken out on the set. In the ensuing chaos, Tommy Hines (Joseph Porter), using a wheelchair and battling a terminal illness, arrives from The Rainbow's End Foundation with his case worker Heather Crocker (Kelsey Sanders). His final wish before he dies is to tour the studio and see the star puppets from the ''Tiny Terrors'' franchise.   Meanwhile, Polly Bonderhoof ([[Michelle Bauer]]) attempts to restore order with a box of baked goods from her sister in [[Waco, Texas]], which includes the Gingerdead Man (voiced by John Vulich). He slips out of the pastry box and locates a spell book in the prop room, which includes a transmigration spell to transfer his soul out of his stale form and into a human body. The spell calls for blood from five victims placed in a [[pentagram]], and then the sacrifice of one more victim, who must be a virgin.   The Gingerdead Man kills four people in various gruesome ways, but is driven off by Kelvin and Heather as he cuts the hand off of a crew member. Kelvin orders the studio evacuated and sets off with Heather to confront the cookie, which goes badly when it seizes control of a prop robot which has functional disintegrating lasers, which disintegrates one of the crew members. Tommy cuts the robot's power cord with an ax and it topples over, momentarily trapping the Gingerdead Man beneath it. Tommy reveals himself to be "Demon Warrior 13," who has faked his illness in order to gain access to the studio and blow it up as revenge for the studio non-responsiveness to the scripts he has submitted. Kelvin offers a three picture deal while Heather sneaks up behind Tommy and attempts to bludgeon him. The assault fails and Kelvin is knocked unconscious.  Kelvin wakes, chained next to Heather on an altar on the ''Tiny Terrors'' set. Tommy is reading an incantation from the spell book, but the Gingerdead Man fatally stabs Tommy from behind, making him the sixth (and virginal) victim for the Transmigration. The gingerdead man, unsure whether one of the victims (the man with the cut off hand) is still alive, changes his plan, and decides to use Kelvin's body as his new host. It is revealed, as the spell finishes, that the gingerdead man has made a mistake- by letting the blood of the virgin touch the pentagram, the spell is tainted, and he accidentally invokes a spell for bringing dolls to life. The dolls from the set of ''Tiny Terrors'' animate themselves, and then attack the Gingerdead Man. They hold him down while one of them gets a [[cross]], drag him to the cross, and crucify him (complete with [[crown of thorns]],) before burning him on the cross.  One of the actors from the movie, Sir Ian Cavanaugh (Jacob Witkin), bursts in and shoots all of the puppets with an [[AK-47]].  Some time later, it is shown that Kelvin has married Heather and ''Tiny Terrors'' has won an award for Best Horror Hand Puppet Motion Picture, while a homeless man ([[Adam Green (filmmaker)|Adam Green]]),  digging for food in a dumpster, comes across the burnt cookie. He takes a bite, and is possessed by the Gingerdead Man.

Seeing inmates arriving and the suffering of those at the camp he realizes what his deeds have accomplished.  
Gomorrah (film)
 The film opens with the murder of [[gangster]]s relaxing in a tanning salon. This shooting occurs between clans of the [[Di Lauro clan|Di Lauro Camorra syndicate]] which rule [[Scampia]]-[[Secondigliano]], and triggers the so-called ''Faida di Scampia'' (Scampia feud) which is the backdrop of the entire movie. The ''Faida'' erupts between members of the Di Lauro syndicate and the so-called ''scissionisti'' (secessionists), who are led by [[Raffaele Amato]], brother of two of the men killed in the opening scene.  The film intertwines five separate stories of people whose lives are touched by [[organized crime]].  '''Don Ciro'''<br> Don Ciro (Gianfelice Imparato) is a timid [[intermediary|middleman]] who distributes money to the families of imprisoned Di Lauro clan members. After the feud develops within the clan, he is ambushed by a pair of angry secessionists during a delivery. Fearing for his life, he later offers to defect to their side. They refuse his offer, and tell Ciro that he has to "pay" for his life by selling some of his former associates. He leads them to the location where he is given the money for distribution. The pair raid the place, killing everyone but Ciro, and take the money. Ciro walks off to an uncertain future.  '''Totò'''<br> Totò (Salvatore Abruzzese) is a 13-year-old grocery delivery boy who witnesses some drug dealers abandon a bag of drugs and a gun while evading the police at ''Sette palazzi'' in [[Scampia]]. He returns the items to the gang, who take him in. His initiation in an [[Naples underground geothermal zone|underground cavern]] consists of him being shot while wearing a [[bulletproof vest]] as a test of courage. As the feud intensifies, families in the neighborhood whose loyalties are suspect are ordered to move out or suffer violence; Totò's fellow gang members receive similar threats. Later, while hanging out with his gang in the streets of [[Scampia]], one of his gang is killed in a drive-by. The gang members decide to stand their ground and exact violent retribution by selecting a woman, Maria (Maria Nazionale), as their next victim, as her son has joined a clan of [[Scissionisti di Secondigliano|Secondigliano secessionists]]. Totò, who has delivered groceries to Maria, is forced to lure her out of her apartment, where his comrades execute her.  '''Roberto'''<br> Roberto (Carmine Paternoster) is a graduate who works in [[waste management]]. His boss, Franco ([[Toni Servillo]]) provides a low-cost [[toxic waste]] disposal service that allows northern industrialists to dispose of materials like [[chromium]] and [[asbestos]] in the countryside of southern Italy. Franco and Roberto orchestrate the illegal disposal of the waste at abandoned quarries and other environmentally-sensitive sites. During one such operation, a drum of toxic chemicals is accidentally spilled on a driver. Franco refuses to call an ambulance, and hires children to drive the trucks when the workers refuse to continue their work. Later, Franco and Roberto meet a family of farmers who, desperate to extinguish their debts, decide to allow the burial of chemical substances in their countryside. An elderly farmer gifts Roberto a basket of peaches, but Franco later tells him to throw them away because they are contaminated. Roberto then decides to quit his job and tells Franco he cannot bring himself to poison the earth, to which Franco says that he shouldn't think he is the better man, because thanks to the actions of people like them Italy was able to enter the European Union, solving problems others had caused. Roberto walks alone on a desolate countryside road.  '''Pasquale'''<br> Pasquale (Salvatore Cantalupo) is an [[haute couture]] tailor who works for Iavarone (Gigio Morra), a garment factory owner with ties to the Camorra. Pasquale takes a night-job training Chinese garment workers. As they are competing with Camorra-controlled firms, the Chinese drive him to and from work in the trunk of their car. His secret work is discovered nonetheless, and his Chinese associates are killed in a drive-by. He survives the attack, but resigns his job. Later, working as a truck driver, he is in a transport café where he spots [[Scarlett Johansson]] on TV wearing one of his dresses. He smiles wryly as he drives away.   '''Marco''' and '''Ciro''' aka '''Sweet Pea'''<br> Marco (Marco Macor) and Ciro (Ciro Petrone) are two young wannabe-gangsters who try to operate their own small racket independently of the local clan. Impressed by mafia portrayals from Hollywood movies, they quote lines and spontaneously reenact scenes from ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' in [[Walter Schiavone]]'s villa while dropping references to [[Tony Montana]], [[Miami]], and [[Colombian people|Colombians]]. Their first score is robbing African immigrants during a drug purchase at the famous Hotel Boomerang, [[Castel Volturno]]. The word of the incident gets to the local mob chieftain Giovanni (Giovanni Venosa), who summons them and warns them under threat of violence not to repeat such behavior in the future. Ignoring him completely, they spy Camorra gangsters hiding a stash of weapons. They steal the weapons and amuse themselves by firing off rounds by the banks of a [[:it:Regi Lagni|Regi Lagni]] canal [[estuary]] in the [[marshland]]. Once they run out of money, they use their guns to rob a [[video arcade]], and spend their stolen funds at a strip club. The gangsters, angered, find them and threaten to kill them if they don't return the weapons within a day. The pair prove stubborn. Zio Vittorio (Vittorio Russo), one of the local gangsters approaches them in a bar with an offer to come work for him. He offers them €10,000 if they return the weapons and  murder Peppe 'O Cavallaro, in fact uncle Bernardino (Bernardino Terracciano). They accept the [[Hitman|contract]], which turns out to be a trap, as they are ambushed and killed by Giovanni, Bernardino, Vittorio and others at the location of their supposed target, an abandoned beach resort next to Regi Lagni canal estuary. The last scene shows their dead bodies being carried away by a front end loader.  
Gone Fishing (2008 film)
 "Gone Fishing" is the touching story of a boy and old man coming to terms with bereavement through their shared love of fishing, and the legend of Goliath, the biggest pike ever caught!  This thirteen-minute short film was financed by 150 film makers and directed by the author of [[The Guerilla Film Makers Handbook]], Chris Jones.  The story is in part autobiographical - while growing up, director Chris Jones and his friends would often attempt to catch the legendary 'Oscar the pike', a fish that according to local myth terrorized the lake at the end of his road, the aptly named Blue Lagoon. This was the inspiration behind the legend of 'Goliath', the big fish in this even bigger tale.<ref>{{cite web   | title = Gone Fishing Press Area   | url   = http://www.gonefishingpress.com/index.htm   }}</ref>

Before he can get it however, Yoon Tae-goo, The Weird ([[Song Kang-ho]])—a [[Honghuzi|thief]]—steals the map and is caught up in The Bad's derailment of the train. This involves the slaughter of the Japanese and Manchurian guards, and various civilians. Park Do-won, The Good ([[Jung Woo-sung]])—an eagle-eyed bounty hunter—appears on the scene to claim the bounty on Chang-yi. Meanwhile, Tae-goo escapes, eluding his Good and Bad pursuers. A fourth force—a group of Manchurian bandits—also want the map to sell to the [[black market|Ghost Market]]. Tae-goo hopes to uncover the map's secrets and recover what he believes is gold and riches buried by the [[Qing Dynasty]] just before the collapse of their government. As the story continues, an escalating battle for the map occurs, with bounties placed on heads and the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] racing to reclaim its map as it can apparently "save the Japanese Empire".  After a series of graphic shootouts and chases, a final battle erupts in which the Japanese army, Manchurian bandits, Do-won, Chang-yi and his gang are chasing Tae-goo all at once. The Japanese army kills most of the bandits. Do-won kills many Japanese soldiers and sets off an explosion that drives them away. Chang-yi's gang is slowly killed off and he kills those that attempt to leave the chase. Only Chang-yi, Tae-goo and Do-won make it to the "treasure". However, they find that it is nothing more than a boarded-over hole in the desert. Chang-yi recognizes Tae-goo as the "Finger Chopper"—a criminal that cut off his finger in a knife fight five years ago—and the man that Do-won had thought Chang-yi to be. Turning on each other in a final act of vengeance for the slights they suffered, they finally gun each other down after a prolonged [[Mexican standoff]]. The three lie in the sand, dying and alone, as the "useless hole" that they fought and died for suddenly and belatedly erupts with a geyser of [[crude oil]]. Do-won survives along with Tae-goo.

Gran Torino
 [[Walt Kowalski]] is a cantankerous, retired [[Polish American]] [[assembly line]] worker and [[Korean War]] veteran, who has recently been widowed after 50 years of marriage, causing him to be a [[lapsed Catholic]]. His [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]] neighborhood in the [[Detroit]] area of Michigan, formerly populated by working-class white families, is now dominated by poor Asian immigrants, and [[gang]] violence is commonplace. Adding to his isolation and detachment are his feelings towards his married sons and their families.  He rejects a suggestion from one of his sons to move to a retirement community (sensing that they want his home and possessions), and lives alone with his elderly dog, Daisy.  A longtime cigarette smoker, Walt suffers from coughing fits, occasionally coughing up blood, but conceals this from his family. Roman Catholic priest Father Janovich tries to comfort him, but Walt disdains the young, inexperienced man. Eventually, Walt opens up to the priest, revealing that he is still haunted by memories of the war.  The [[Hmong people|Hmong]] Vang Lor family reside next door to Walt. Initially, he wants nothing to do with his new neighbors, particularly after he catches [[Thao Vang Lor|Thao]] attempting to steal his [[Ford Torino#1972.E2.80.931976: Gran Torino|1972 Ford Gran Torino]] as a coerced initiation into a Hmong gang run by Thao's cousin, Fong, whose nickname is "Spider". The gang is infuriated by Thao's failure and they attack him, but Walt confronts them with an [[M1 Garand]] rifle and chases them off, earning the respect of the Hmong community.  As penance, Thao's mother makes him work for Walt, who has him do [[Handyman|odd jobs]] around the neighborhood, and the two form a grudging mutual respect. Thao's sister Sue introduces Walt to Hmong culture and helps him bond with the Hmong community, who soon become more like family to Walt than his actual family and he, in turn, becomes a better man to them than he was to his own sons. Walt helps Thao get a job and gives him dating advice. Walt eventually visits a doctor regarding his coughing fits, where it's implied that he does not have long to live.  Spider's gang continues to pressure Thao, assaulting him on his way home from work. After he sees Thao's injuries, Walt visits the gang's house, where he attacks a gang member as a warning. In retaliation, the gang performs a [[drive-by shooting]] on the Vang Lor home, injuring Thao. They also beat up Sue, and it is cinematographically hinted that perhaps they raped her. There are no other witnesses, while the community members, including the victims, refuse to assist the police to incriminate the gang members.  The next day, Thao seeks Walt's help to exact revenge, and Walt tells him to return later in the afternoon. In the meantime, Walt makes personal preparations: he buys a suit, gets a haircut, and makes a [[Confession (religion)|confession]] to Father Janovich, who had pressured him to make it at the behest of his late wife. When Thao returns, Walt takes him to the basement, gives him his [[Silver Star]] medal, then locks him in the basement and tells him of his haunting memory of having killed a surrendering enemy soldier. He keeps Thao locked in the basement, until the revenge is over, to make sure the boy will never be haunted by killing someone, with his life ahead of him.  That night, Walt goes to the gang members' house, where they draw their firearms on him. He loudly berates them and enumerates their crimes, drawing the attention of the neighbors. Putting a cigarette in his mouth, he asks for a light, then puts his hand in the pocket of his jacket and provocatively pulls it out as if he were holding a gun, causing the gang members to shoot and kill him. As he falls to the ground, his hand opens to reveal the [[Zippo]] cigarette lighter with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry]] insignia; he was unarmed. His plan had in fact been to provoke them into killing him in public. Sue, following Walt's directions, frees Thao, and they drive to the scene in Walt's Gran Torino. One of the police officers tells them that all gang members have been placed under arrest for the murder, and due to the number of witnesses, they all face a lengthy sentence in prison.  Walt's funeral mass is celebrated by Father Janovich and attended by his family and many of the Hmong community, many of whom are wearing traditional attire; their presence visibly puzzles Walt's family. Later, his last will and testament is read. To his family's surprise, Walt leaves them nothing. His house goes to the church and his cherished Gran Torino goes to Thao, with the condition that he does not modify the vehicle. Later, Thao is seen driving the car along [[Jefferson Avenue (Detroit)|Jefferson Avenue]] with Daisy.

Troy comes to enjoy traveling with Buck to performances in smaller venues such as [[Bakersfield]] and [[Akron]]. In particular, Troy sincerely admires Buck's signature trick: having someone in the audience hide his fee for that night's performance, which he then unfailingly discovers. ([[Kreskin]] is said to have actually performed this feat 6,000 times, only failing to find the money nine times.)<ref>United Airlines in-flight entertainment guide, August 2009.</ref>  A reluctant publicist, Valerie Brennan ([[Emily Blunt]]), is sent to join them in Cincinnati as a replacement for a more senior colleague to promote Buck's still secret attempt to resurrect his career. Valerie is disgusted by Buck's verbal abuse towards her and Troy, with whom she becomes romantically involved. Buck reveals that his comeback will involve putting "hundreds" of people (actually only a few dozen) to sleep and then awakening them as if from the dead. The trick works, but despite a large press turnout, no one is there to record the act, since the news media is called away at the last second to cover a car accident involving [[Jerry Springer]]. Furious, Buck unfairly blames the mishap on Troy and Valerie, and then faints from exhaustion.  In the hospital, Buck and Troy discover that the media absence actually worked in Buck's favor, as rumors reported by the news media exaggerate the scope of Buck's act; as a result, Buck returns to the limelight as a retro-"hip" phenomenon. He appears on television shows such as those of [[Jon Stewart]], [[Regis Philbin]], [[Conan O'Brien]], and more. Buck is reunited with his estranged friend, [[George Takei]], who sings "[[What the World Needs Now Is Love|What the World Needs Now]]".  Buck finally gets the call he has been waiting for: To perform once again on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. He previously had performed with [[Johnny Carson]] 61 times during the height of his career, but never since the show has been hosted by [[Jay Leno]].

When the limelight on Buck dims once more after he fails to find his money for the first time ever during his Las Vegas premiere, Troy leaves him and through Valerie's connections, lands a job with a celebrated TV writer ([[Griffin Dunne]]). After some time, Troy sees from an ad in the paper that Buck is doing his show again in Bakersfield. Buck is clearly back where he feels most comfortable, and once again successfully performs his signature trick, leaving Troy to wonder whether Buck doesn't have some mysterious talent after all.

The rest of the group reach the main camping site where they spend the night.

Noh arrives at GP 506 about an hour later. On the way to the office, he passes a boiler room that has words written in blood on the wall, which says: “Kill all of them.” He is brought to the recreation room where the bodies were found, and watches in shock at the amount of blood splattered around the room.  In the present, Noh checks the guard post’s records and notices that someone has been controlling the weapons lately. All personal weapons were kept in the armory and not in the barracks, which was unusual. One of the soldiers reports to Noh, informing him that they have found another survivor, inside the generator room. This survivor portrays himself as Yoo.  Noh reports to his superior on the phone, who wants him to bring Yoo back, despite his objections as the investigation has not been completed yet and will be forced to end once the clean up crew arrives in the morning. Noh refuses to listen anymore to his superior and ends the call. He then goes off to look for Yoo at the canteen, only to find he’s not there.   Noh reads Kang’s personal records that he was a troublemaker, but he thinks that Kang doesn’t look like one who would go insane and embark on a killing spree. He pores over Yoo’s journal.   In the present, Doc returns with the bodies and Cpl. Kang lapses into critical condition. Despite Doc’s attempts to resuscitate him, Kang dies. As they talk, Kim supposedly saw the dark silhouette of what he thinks is Sergeant Ma walking towards the medic room where they were. He went hysterical and pointed the shadow out to Yoo. Yoo passes out and on waking, finds Kim dead. He then confiscates all ammunition and live ordinance.   In the present, Doc is unable to find any cold medicine in the post first aid room which supposedly should have sufficient amounts of it. Meanwhile, Cpl. Kwak and his buddy are sent for sentry duty.  Men start to notice a red rash appearing on their bodies.  In a matter of hours, the disease that inflicted the men of 506 will be present in the new men as well. Doc surmises that a rabic-like virus infects the men, making them turn violent and kill each other, but he does not know how the infection spreads.  Noh, Doc, 1st Lt. Bang and the sergeants gather the remaining men for an inspection due to the disease. Doc divides up the men according to whether they have the rashes on their bodies. However, when Noh orders the infected to strip their weapons and hand them over, they refuse and the soldiers present have a standoff. Meanwhile, Kwon, tied up in the generator room, struggles with his bonds and knocks out the electric supply temporarily, blacking out the bunker.   Noh, upon learning the truth from Kwon, beats him up in anger, due to him withholding the truth and his own selfish reasons of wanting to live, have caused his own men and Noh's group to die. Kwon retorts back, saying that HQ did not care about them when they were dying like mad dogs here. Later, while staring at the rain outside, Noh touches his family photo and comes to a terrible resolution. He goes into the office and finds the keys to the bunker. When leaving, he hears sobbing sounds from a corner, to find Sergeant Yoon. He discovers Yoon is infected.   Lee orders the men to look for Noh, who is busy spilling kerosene all around the rooms, passageways and corridors of the bunker. Lee and the soldiers manage to corner Noh in the shower room. Unable to kill Noh, Lee wants him to join them and deny that the disease ever happened.  Noh and Doc manages to kill 3 of the men, with Noh injured. Doc runs out of ammo in the end and is shot to death by Lee.  The soldiers approaching the bunker instantly drop to the ground for safety, while GP 506 has turned into a smoking ruin.  
Gulabi Talkies
 The film is set in the late 1990s among the fishing communities around [[Kundapura]], in the southwestern Indian state of [[Karnataka]]. The impulsive midwife Gulabi ([[Umashree]]) is the protagonist, whose one passion is the cinema. She leads a lonely life in an island inhabited by fisher folk. Her husband Musa (K.G. Krishna Murthy), a small-time fish-selling agent, has deserted her and is living happily with his second wife Kunjipathu and their child Adda.  A family gifts her a television with a satellite dish antenna in gratitude after she attends to a difficult delivery (for which they even had to bodily remove her from a movie theatre). The arrival of the first color TV in her small island village heralds great changes in the sleepy hamlet. The women in the village begin gathering at her house once the men leave for fishing. However, a few of them stay away, since Gulabi is one of the few Muslims in the village. Yet others prefer to watch from outside her shack, without entering it.  Among the regulars at her home is Netru (singer-actress M.D. Pallavi), a girl with an absentee husband and a domineering mother-in-law, whom Gulabi befriends and becomes a confidante to. But Netru disappears and Gulabi is blamed, leaving her all alone in the village.  The [[Kargil War]] of 1999 and the rise of [[Communalism (South Asia)|communalism]] in Karnataka provide the backdrop to the film. The communal stereotyping of Muslims following the Kargil War finds an echo in the village. The tension between the small fishermen of the village and a Muslim businessman (who is actually never shown throughout the film) with a growing fleet of commercial trawlers acquires a communal color.  The disappearance of Netru adds to the mounting tensions. The Muslims in the village flee and urge Gulabi to leave too, but she refuses and stays put in the village. Her house is vandalized and she is forcibly taken to a boat to leave the island. The young men from outside who spearhead the attack assure the villagers that Gulabi's television would remain in her house.  The film ends with a scene in which two illiterate elderly women, who had hitherto refused to enter Gulabi's house, going in there to watch TV (which they do not know how to switch on - they are probably unaware even that it has to be switched on).

Hamlet 2
 Dana Marschz is a recovering [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] and failed actor who has become a high school drama teacher in [[Tucson, Arizona]], "where dreams go to die". Despite considering himself an inspirational figure, he only has two enthusiastic students, Rand Posin and Epiphany Sellars, and a history of producing poorly received school plays that are essentially stage adaptations of popular [[Hollywood]] films (his latest being ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]''). When the new term begins, a new intake of students are forced to transfer into his class as it is the only remaining arts elective available due to budget cutbacks; they are generally unenthusiastic and unconvinced by Dana’s pretensions, and Dana comes into conflict with Octavio, one of the new students.  Dana is floored when Principal Rocker notifies him that the drama program is to be shut down at the end of the term. Seeking to inspire his students, Dana undertakes to write and produce an original play: a sequel to ''[[Hamlet]]'' featuring [[time travel]] to avoid the deaths of the characters, and new, more controversial content, including the introduction of [[Jesus Christ]] as one of the characters, complete with a song-and-dance number titled "Rock Me Sexy Jesus". The kids gradually warm to the project, but Rand – cast as a [[bi-curious]] [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]] and overshadowed by Octavio as Hamlet – storms out of the drama group and provides a copy of the play’s script to Principal Rocker, who orders Dana to stop the controversial production.  Dana is further traumatized when his wife Brie leaves him for the uninteresting, but fertile, boarder Gary they had taken into their home to supplement their modest income, and reveals that he himself is infertile. Despondent, Dana falls off the wagon and tries to abandon the project, but his students encourage him to continue, arranging an abandoned warehouse and rave spot, technical assistance, and security being provided by the high school's football and wrestling teams. Dana also learns that the cancellation of the play has become a [[civil liberties]] issue encouraged by fanatical [[ACLU]] activist Cricket Feldstein. As a result, the play opens to a sold-out house, including a critic from ''[[The New York Times]]''. Rand returns to the group, apologizing for his desertion; Dana allows him to return to the role of Laertes.  The play itself initially meets with a mixed reception, due to its controversial content and mangling of the original play; in keeping with a running joke throughout the movie, much of the content revolves around the characters using time travel to mend their troubled relationships with their fathers; it ends with both [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] and Jesus forgiving their fathers for the wrongs done to them. Although initially reluctant to engage with the play, with several protesters infiltrating the audience to stage a direct protest, the play gradually wins the audience over. The film ends with Dana and his favorite actress, [[Elisabeth Shue]] – whom he is now dating – meeting Dana’s students to prepare for the show's [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] opening, complete with original cast.

The "prep", Steve, is still bitter after his best friend Jamie, the "jock", had sex with Lisa, a girl with whom Steve was smitten and even took to their senior prom. After Steve and his friends Joey, Patrick, and A.J. harass the "[[Transvestite|tranny]]", Sam, they are chastised by Jamie. This leads to a brawl between Steve's team and Jamie's. Lisa breaks up the fight by dropping a bowling ball on Steve's foot just as Steve is about to kick Jamie again. Egerton, brandishing a shotgun, tells the teenagers to leave and they can continue their tournament the following night.  Lisa, having forgot her purse in the arcade, returns to find Steve and his friends waiting for her. Steve proceeds to violently rape Lisa while the others watch. Egerton is oblivious to Lisa's cries for help, as he is downstairs cleaning up the mess the teenagers made. After he is finished raping Lisa, Steve leaves the room. While Steve is gone, A.J. anally rapes Lisa on the pool table; then it's Joey who abuses her. Patrick, who believed the three were only going to "scare" Lisa, refuses to participate in the rape. Steve returns with a bowling pin and prepares to insert it into Lisa before Patrick intervenes. Steve retorts by giving Patrick the pin and ordering him to do it himself. Patrick refuses to do so at first but complies when Steve threatens to do the same to him. In the end Patrick penetrates Lisa with the bowling pin as she screams in pain. The four leave Lisa on the pool table, naked and barely conscious.  The following night, the two groups arrive at the bowling alley to continue their tournament. Steve is joined by his "girlfriends", Julia and Hannah. Jamie arrives late with Lisa, who barely speaks. As the teams begin their first game of the night, Lisa suddenly gets on an elevator. She is confronted by Patrick, who says he's only at the bowling alley to apologize. Lisa doesn't believe him, and insists that he is only there to make sure that she hasn't contacted the police. During the game, the players notice a mystery player on the scoreboard, BBK, but believe it is just a glitch. Dave, one of Jamie's friends, meets Julia in the bar and pays for two beers she ordered. When he discovers that one of them belongs to Steve, he asks if he can urinate in it. Julia tells him that she doesn't care and that she dislikes Steve too but hangs out with him anyway because he's dating her friend Hannah. Julia follows Dave into the bathroom and the two begin to make out. A mysterious person wearing bowling attire exits one of the stalls while Dave and Julia are in the [[69 (sex position)|69]] position and forces Julia's head further onto Dave's penis while forcing Dave's head further between Julia's legs, suffocating them both. After they are dead, two strikes appear next to BBK on the scoreboard in the form of a [[Skull and crossbones (poison)|skull and crossbones]].  The game continues and Sam goes to the bathroom so she can "freshen up". The person who murdered Dave and Julia is hiding in one of the stalls when Sam enters the girls' restroom and Sam, frightened by the noise coming from the stall, approaches it and is pulled inside. She tries to bargain with the killer, but the killer murders her by forcing a bowling pin down her throat. The killer lifts Sam's skirt up and, using the switchblade Sam tried to defend herself with, castrates Sam lengthwise. Later, Ben and Cindy leave to have sex in a storage room upstairs, but Ben leaves Cindy alone to buy a condom from the vending machine in the bathroom. He dies when the killer hits him over the head with a bowling pin and gouges his eyes out with a sharpened one. The killer finds Cindy upstairs and strangles her to death with a pair of bowling sneakers. Downstairs, Hannah searches for Julia but dies when the killer crushes her head with two bowling balls. Joey goes back behind the pin setters to fix his team's after noticing they were broken. A.J. notices the strikes appearing next to BBK on the scoreboard and questions Egerton about it, who assures him that it is still a glitch. Egerton sends A.J. to an area currently being remodeled with an "out of order" sign to put on an automatic ball polisher that Joey broke earlier. A.J. turns the ball polisher on and finds it already fixed but gets killed when the killer uses it to wax his face off.  Steve, noticing that something is amiss, leaves to find Joey behind the pin setters. Joey lies dead on the ground, headless. Steve is frightened by the killer, who bludgeons him with a bowling pin before sodomizing him with another sharpened pin. As Steve tries to crawl away, the killer smashes his head in with the bowling pin. Meanwhile, Sarah and Jamie continue their game. Jamie reaches into the ball return slot to find his bowling ball, instead discovering Joey's severed head. The two try desperately to escape the bowling alley before coming face to face with the killer. They run and hide in the basement, where they find their friends' bodies. The killer appears with a shotgun and removes the bowling bag to reveal Egerton's face. Sarah discovers that Jamie knew about the murders of Steve, Joey, and A.J. but not the others. Lisa appears, dressed up as well, revealing that she murdered Steve. Jamie explains that Lisa told her father, who turns out to be Egerton, about the rape and Egerton let Jamie in on the plan. When asked why he killed their friends too, Egerton explains that they didn't intervene when Lisa reentered the bowling alley and are therefore just as guilty. Another person dressed like the killer, as Egerton goes on to explain, Another killer (possibly the real "BBK") enters the basement and removes the bowling bag to reveal Patrick's face. Patrick explains that he confessed his involvement to Egerton and wanted to contact the police, but Egerton let him in on the plan instead and he was the person who murdered Joey and A.J., supposedly to make it up to her. Lisa is furious that her father allowed him to live so Egerton betrays Patrick and slits his throat with the switchblade he got from Sam. Jamie, realizing he's out of control, wrestles Egerton to the ground and, after a scuffle, blows his head clean off with the shotgun. Lisa cradles her father's body before grabbing the switchblade and trying to attack Jamie. Sarah grabs the shotgun and kills Lisa.  With the three "BBK"'s dead, Sarah shoots the locks off of the emergency doors and the two survivors escape the bowling alley. Traumatized and, above all, upset that Jamie did nothing to prevent the murders, Sarah turns the gun on him, pumps it saying: ''"'cuz we're both fucked"''. The screen cuts to black as a gunshot is heard, indicating that Sarah murdered Jamie and is on the run.

A month later Ray and his family receive a call from Hancock, revealing he has imprinted the Moon’s surface with Ray’s AllHeart marketing logo. In a mid-credits scene, Hancock approaches a criminal in [[New York City]], who calls him an asshole.

Tsukushi and Tsukasa finally arrive in Las Vegas. They check into a motel before going to a casino, a location where Nishida told them the thief might be. They meet Shigeru Okawahara ([[Natsuki Katō]]), who reveals that she is seeing Kazu Kaburagi ([[Naohito Fujiki]]), the heir of a large company that owns the hotel where the tiara was stolen.

Harold (film)
 Harold Reynolds ([[Spencer Breslin]]) is a 13-year-old boy with early [[male pattern baldness]]. Harold seems to cope all right in his hometown, Douglasburg, until his mom, Maureen ([[Ally Sheedy]]), announces that the family is moving to a new house in a new town. Harold panics, because he had somewhat fit in with everyone at his old school, despite his baldness.  When he arrives in his new house, Harold is met by an elderly new neighbor, Maude ([[Suzanne Shepherd]]), who assumes Harold is older because of his baldness, and starts flirting with him. Harold starts at his new school, and because he initially wears a hat into class, he is seemingly accepted, especially by a girl, Evelyn ([[Elizabeth Gillies]]), whom he briefly flirts with. When the teacher, Ms. Vicki Norris ([[Rachel Dratch]]), notices him wearing a hat, he is forced to take it off, thus revealing that he is bald. Instantly he is ostracized by the other students, including Evelyn.  Harold's older sister, Shelley ([[Stella Maeve]]), has started High School in the new town as an immensely popular and flirty cheerleader. She meets a boy named Patrick (Robert Gorry) and they quickly start dating, which leads to Patrick assuming that Harold is Shelley's father. Patrick asks Harold to buy some beer for him and his friends, which works multiple times.  Harold is bullied relentlessly by students. One of the few nice people is Cromer Styles ([[Cuba Gooding Jr.]]), the school janitor. While in gym class, the bullying rears its ugly head and the Coach ([[Chris Parnell]]) joins in. Cromer comes to the rescue when he announces Harold is wanted in the office. That was just a decoy – Cromer and Harold watch TV in the janitor's room.  Harold returns home, angry and upset, and decides to go back to his old home, where everyone liked him. He leaves late at night so that his Mom and sister won't get suspicious. He only makes it as far as a [[strip bar]]. Harold thinks that because he looks older, he may pass for legal age, but Cromer is there as well, and he takes Harold home. He gives Harold words of encouragement, and then drops him off at home.  The next day in gym class, Harold is asked to take his shirt off as part of the Skins and Shirts team. He has a big strip of hair on his back, and everyone starts laughing at him. He talks to Cromer, and they decide to pull a prank on the coach, turning off the hot water when the coach is in the shower.  [[Image:Harold (2008 film character).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Harold ([[Spencer Breslin]])]]  Not wanting to go back to school, Harold buys a few beers for himself, and is followed by Maude, who still thinks that he is much older. When he tells her he is 14, she thinks that means the size of his manhood. When he explains he is only 14 years old, she tells him to come back in a few years.  Patrick and his buddies ask Harold for one more favor: to get them some beer for a party. Harold buys the beer, but is arrested by police, who believe him to be an adult selling beer to minors. They do not believe him when he tells them that he is only fourteen. He is taken to jail and is bailed out by Cromer.  Later that night, Patrick apologizes for what happened, and tells Harold he wants to have sex with Harold's sister. Shelley tells Harold she doesn't really want to have sex, although she likes Patrick. They get Cromer to wait outside the hotel room, When Shelley leaves the room, Maude is sent in her place, and Patrick ends up having sex with her.  There is a [[go cart]] race coming up, and some of the bullies put a dent in Harold's cart in order to slow him down, but Cromer repairs the dent. A lady from the crowd shows her breasts to the bullies in order to distract them, enabling Harold to win the race, and, ultimately, the respect of the school.  The movie ends with Harold holding his trophy and the bullies apologizing for teasing him, now wanting to be his friends.  
Happy-Go-Lucky
 Thirty years old and single, Pauline "Poppy" Cross shares a London flat with her best friend Zoe, a fellow teacher. Poppy is free-minded, high-spirited and kind-hearted. The film opens with Poppy trying to engage a shop employee in conversation. He ignores her, yet his icy demeanour does not bother her. She maintains her good mood even when she discovers her bicycle has been stolen. Her main concern is not getting a new one or finding the bicycle, but that she did not get a chance to say goodbye to it. This prompts her to decide to learn how to drive.  When Poppy takes driving lessons for the first time, her positive attitude contrasts starkly with her gloomy, intolerant and cynical driving instructor, Scott. He is emotionally repressed, has anger problems and becomes extremely agitated by Poppy's casual attitude towards driving. As Poppy gets to know him, it becomes evident that Scott believes in conspiracy theories. His beliefs are partly attributable to his racist and misogynistic views, which make it hard for him to get along with others. Scott seems to be angered by Poppy's sunny personality and what he perceives as a lack of responsibility and concern for driving safety. Scott is exceptionally irritated by Poppy's choice of footwear (a pair of high-heeled boots), which he feels compromises her ability to drive. From the outset, he feels Poppy does not take her lessons seriously and is careless.  Poppy, however, does have the capacity to be responsible. At school, Poppy observes one of her pupils bullying one of his classmates. Rather than becoming angry, she worries about him and takes the appropriate action. After speaking with her student, she comes to the correct conclusion that her student is being abused at home. A social worker, Tim, is brought in to handle the boy's case. Through Tim and the pupil's interactions, the latter reveals that his mother's boyfriend has been beating him. Tim and Poppy begin dating.  Poppy, Zoe, and Poppy's younger sister, Suzy, go to visit another sister, Helen, who lives with her husband in [[Southend-on-Sea]] and is pregnant. Helen proves to be a very judgmental person and tells Poppy she needs to "take life seriously", "not get drunk every night" and plan for the future. Poppy responds that she is happy with her life as it is. Helen tries to convince Poppy to be more responsible condescendingly telling her she is too childish, but Poppy insists that she is happy and ignores her advice.  Returning home, Poppy sees Scott standing across the street from her flat, and when she calls his name, he runs away. When she confronts him he insists he had been visiting his mother in [[Stevenage]] at the time she saw him. Scott later sees Poppy with her new boyfriend, Tim, and he becomes angry. During Poppy's subsequent driving lesson, Scott drives erratically while ranting about other drivers and society. When he gives Poppy the keys to his car, she tells him he is in no condition to give a driving lesson, and she will drive him home. Scott tries to get his keys back and physically attacks Poppy. She manages to escape his grasp, then in a long, rambling diatribe Scott accuses Poppy of trying to seduce him, revealing his romantic feelings for her. Using patience and understanding to teach him a lesson, Poppy waits until he has calmed down then gives the keys back, telling him this lesson will be their last.  The film ends with Poppy and Zoe together maneuvering a rowboat in [[Regent's Park]], as Zoe advises Poppy she "can't make everyone happy." Poppy dismisses the advice, cheerfully but not naively. Poppy takes a mobile call from Tim, saying "missing me already?" symbolizing that her job is not done yet.

The story goes that Ram has a problem with his brain and is unable to control his hyper emotions about few things which makes him a beast at times. He would not even hesitate to kill and does not like anyone being praised or belittling him. In this process, he builds a grudge against his own brother who is good at everything and tries to kill him right during their childhood. Their mother (Seetha) is unable to tolerate all this and takes it upon herself to change Ram, so she takes him away from Hari to avoid further hatred but then not much change happens in the nature of Ram even after they grow up. Meanwhile, Hari is often chased by Anjali ([[Priyamani]]) who poses as a bank employee but in truth she is actually a CBI officer who comes to arrest Hari since she suspects his hand in the killings. Apparently, the doctor happens to be the younger brother of the health minister Siva Reddy ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]) and from then on the minister is closely on the heels of the killer. Anjali finally manages to arrest Hari successfully through a plan of hers and soon she realizes her folly when she chances upon his mother and understands the entire story of Hari and Ram.

He gives her an early birthday present, but her father ([[Jamie McShane]]) shows up and demands that she leave with him. As they drive home, Laurel tells him that she will be marrying Michael as soon as she turns eighteen. He breaks down and apologizes to her, telling her he can't let her turn 18, then purposely crashes their car. Seeing that she is not dead, he kills her with a broken piece of mirror, saying he couldn't let the darkness take her.  The film then switches to present day where 17-year-old Molly Hartley ([[Haley Bennett]]) is stabbed in the chest by her deranged mother Jane ([[Marin Hinkle]]) with a pair of scissors one day after school. Although she survives and her wound is healed with only a scar remaining, she is still haunted in her dreams and hears things because of the frightening experience. Molly lives with her father Robert ([[Jake Weber]]), and her mother is locked up in a mental ward outside the town she recently moved to. Her father enrolls Molly in a new school to help with the trauma and start a new life. However, as her eighteenth birthday approaches, Molly must deal with both the stress of being a new student and with the continuing nightmares she has of her mother's attack. Joseph Young ([[Chace Crawford]]), one of Molly's classmates, attempts to help her; however, Molly begins to display symptoms of the same psychosis that took control of her mother's life. Molly then attends a party at Joseph's house, where his jealous ex-girlfriend tries to attack her. She breaks her arm after leaving the party on foot, due to being refused a ride home by one of her new friends. Then she has another hallucination of Jane and has a panic attack. The next morning she apologizes to Joseph's ex, who tells Molly she knows that Molly is really asking what she is. After telling Joseph to leave her alone, Molly runs into Alexis (?), who offers salvation which Molly declines. Afterwards she arrives home where she is cornered by Jane and discovers that she, and others who share her mother's concerns, want to kill her in order to save her from a preordained life as a servant to [[Satan]]. It is revealed that Molly had died as the result of a miscarriage and her parents made a [[Deal with the Devil|pact with the Devil]] disguised as a woman to save her life. The terms of the agreement were such that the Hartleys would only have Molly until her eighteenth birthday, then she would belong to the Devil. After Jane is accidentally killed, and upon knocking her father out, Molly runs to seek salvation by accepting a baptism by Alexis, who later tries to drown her after stating she know what she is. Then Alexis accidentally is knocked on her head which kills her and Molly turns to Joseph for help, only to discover that he is one of them and has set her up by taking her to his house.  Dr. Emerson ([[Nina Siemaszko]]) arrives at Joseph's house and tells Molly that she is also to be a servant of the devil. She says Molly can either kill her father to break the pact, or submit to the Devil. She tries to let her father live and avoid her fate by attempting suicide with a kitchen knife. This attempt is in vain because the clock has already struck midnight.  The film switches to a mental institution, where a doctor is talking to a woman dressed in black, later revealed to be a cold-hearted Molly. It is revealed that Molly's father has now been admitted to the institution; Molly casually smiles and says she will not speak to him, instead choosing to move on. Molly becomes valedictorian of her high school, and dates Joseph. She is seen leaving her high school graduation with Joseph in a limousine, after being told by Dr. Emerson (disguised as the school guidance counselor) that they'll "see her soon."  
Hassan and Marcus
 When the lives of Mahmoud, a [[Muslim]] [[sheikh]] ([[Omar Sharif]]) and Boulos, a [[Copt|Christian]] [[priest]] ([[Adel Emam]]) are threatened by [[Fundamentalism|religious extremists]] on both sides, the Egyptian government inducts them into a [[witness protection program]] that requires them to disguise themselves as the Christian, Marcus Abdel-Shahid, and a Muslim sheikh, Hassan el-Attar, respectively.  When, unwittingly, they move into the same building, a friendship blossoms that must, along with a romance between the protagonists' children, withstand the difficulties of prejudice and social persecution.  Hassan and Morcos do not attempt to name the reasons for the tension between Christians and Muslims but, according to the political writer and Coptic Christian Sameh Fawzi, the conflicts have nothing to do with religion.  
The Headless Woman (2008 film)
 This film is centered around Vero (Onetto), an Argentinean bourgeois woman, and how her life slowly twists out of control after she may or may not have struck and killed a dark-skinned servant's child with her car. As Vero is driving, she is distracted by her cell phone and, as she looks down to answer it, her car hits something. She peers in the rear-view mirror, collects herself, and drives away. We do not see what she has run over; a non-point-of-view shot of Vero driving away from the scene shows there is indeed a body, but it is unclear whether it is an animal or a person.  Although Vero seems indifferent about the situation, it is clear that the incident deeply disturbs her. She acts clumsy and out of place. When she informs her husband Marcos that she thinks she may have run over someone, she insists upon returning to the scene of the accident; they see something on the side of the road, which her husband insists is merely a dog, though Vero is even more unsure than before. Later, the body of a dark-skinned servant's child is recovered from a canal, right above the spot where the accident occurred. Her daughter Candita tells her that she wants to know more about "that boy who was murdered," but Vero insists that the boy was drowned: "The papers say he was drowned."  Still privately unconvinced, in an attempt to jog back her memory after the accident, she revisits a hospital where she had X-rays taken and a hotel where she had a post-accident tryst with her lover Juan Manuel. She discovers that there are no records of her visits to a hospital (perhaps scrubbed by her brother, who works there) and the Hotel where she stayed (perhaps scrubbed by Juan Manuel). Finally, she attends a bourgeois party in a hotel, smiling weakly and dazedly as people enter in and out of the busy frame.

After the magical creatures are driven back by the humans, the goblin blacksmiths extend an offer to Balor, king of the elves, to build him an indestructible mechanical army. Encouraged by his son Prince Nuada, Balor accepts; the Golden Army subsequently decimates humanity. Regretting his actions, Balor forms a truce with the humans, that they will keep to the cities and the magical creatures to the forests. The crown to command the Golden Army, which can only be worn by one of royal blood, is split into three pieces. Nuada, disagreeing with the truce, leaves in exile.  In the present, Nuada returns and begins gathering the pieces of the crown.

Nuada tracks his sister to the B.P.R.D. headquarters using their magical bond, which causes them to share wounds and read each other's thoughts. Nuala hides the final crown piece before Nuada finds her, and he battles Hellboy. Nuada critically wounds Hellboy with his spear and abducts Nuala, promising her return in exchange for the crown piece. Unable to remove the spear shard in his wound, Liz, Abe and Krauss take Hellboy to the Golden Army's location in the [[Giants Causeway]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. They encounter the Bethmoora goblin master blacksmith who brings them before the Angel of Death to retrieve the spear shard. Though warned Hellboy will doom humanity if he lives, and that she will suffer the most from it, Liz pleads for Hellboy's life. The Angel removes the shard from Hellboy's chest and tells Liz to give him a reason to live. She reveals to Hellboy that he will be a father, and he recovers.  The goblin leads the team to the resting place of the Golden Army, where Nuada awaits them. Abe gives him the last piece of the crown and Nuada awakens the Golden Army, and commands them to kill the team.

Heaven on Earth (2008 film)
 Vibrant Chand is a young bride leaving her home in Ludhiana, Punjab, India, for Brampton, Ontario, Canada, where her husband Rocky and his very traditional family await her arrival. Everything is new and unfamiliar to Chand including the quiet and shy Rocky who she meets for the first time at the Arrivals level of Pearson Airport. Chand approaches her new life and land with equanimity and grace, and at times the wide-eyed optimism of hope—her first snowfall is a tiny miracle of beauty, and the roar of Niagara Falls creates the excitement of new beginnings.  But soon optimism turns to isolation as the family she has inherited struggles beneath the weight of unspoken words, their collective frustration becoming palpable. No one feels the pressure more than Rocky, weighed down by familial obligations.

("[[Right Here, Right Now (High School Musical song)|Right Here, Right Now]]")  Sharpay hires a personal assistant, a British [[exchange student]] named Tiara Gold, to help relieve the stress of senior year. Drama teacher Ms. Darbus, notices the lack of sign-ups and Sharpay suggests a one- woman show. The writer and [[pianist]] of the show Kelsi, signs everyone in homeroom up at the displease of the rest of the class. Ms. Darbus announces that the show will be called "Senior Year" and will focus on the future of the graduating seniors. In addition, she reveals that Sharpay, Ryan, Kelsi, and Troy have all been considered for a scholarship at [[Juilliard School]], but only one of them is to be chosen. Troy is confused because he did not apply to Juilliard. Seeing his friends laughing, he believes they gave his name to Juilliard. Sharpay becomes desperate to win the scholarship, and knowing that Kelsi will give the best songs to Troy and Gabriella in the musical, she gets Ryan to try to persuade Kelsi to give them a song, by predicting her (and Ryan's) future ("[[I Want It All (High School Musical song)|I Want It All]]").  The very next day, Troy asks Gabriella to the dance while on the rooftop (seen previously in [[High School Musical|the first film]] as The Garden Club, a place where Troy goes seeking some quiet). She then teaches him how to waltz ("Can I Have This Dance?"). After that, Troy and Chad steal Jimmie and Donnie's clothes while they are showering, thus leading through a big chase through the halls of East High and into the auditorium and Ms. Darbus forced them to volunteer as understudies, and gives all 4 of them detention. Chad then asks Taylor to go to prom with him with a cheesy pick-up line. She initially refuses, but later relents when Chad proves he can put in some effort and asks again in front of everyone in school during lunch. The group rehearses for the musical, a scene about their prom night ("[[A Night to Remember (High School Musical song)|A Night to Remember]]"). The next day, Ryan walks in on Kelsi composing in the music room and they start to sing ("[[Just Wanna Be with You]]") which leads to Ryan asking Kelsi to prom. While Troy and Chad reminisce about their past in Reilly's Auto Parts ("The Boys Are Back"). Tiara overhears Gabriella and Taylor's conversation about the Stanford Freshman's Honors Program and informs Sharpay about it, while Sharpay convinces Troy that he is the only thing keeping Gabriella from her dream. Troy talks to Gabriella about this and after sharing an awkward goodnight, Gabriella sings ("Walk Away") and leaves for college the next day.  Troy's father, Jack, talks to him about his academic future, which he expects will be in the [[University of Albuquerque]]. This assumption makes Troy become angry and confused about which college he is going to, and he runs away, storming around East High bewildered until he finally screams at the top of his lungs in the theater ("Scream"). Ms. Darbus is secretly watching and reveals that she sent in his application for Juilliard. Troy later gets a call from Gabriella saying that although she loves him, she will not return to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] for prom or graduation. However, on the day of the prom, Troy visits Gabriella at [[Stanford University]] and convinces her to return and they kiss during the lunch break ("Can I Have This Dance? (Reprise)"). Back at East High, Sharpay is prepared for the last musical at East High and Troy's fellow basketball player Jimmie receives a text from Troy to tell him to cover for him onstage because he is going to be late. The Juilliard representatives are there, and watch as the show seems to go well.  Kelsi and Ryan start out the show followed by a couple other numbers; Jimmie then performs with Sharpay, both as understudies for Troy and Gabriella, and embarrasses her, although the audience applauds the performance. Troy and Gabriella appear during the second half of the show and sing their duet together, redoing Jimmie and Sharpay's understudied reprise. Tiara then betrays Sharpay and tells her how she is going to take over next year in the drama department. Sharpay finally learns how it feels to be manipulated and humiliated, but nevertheless does not wish to go down. While Tiara performs, Sharpay immediately crashes her performance and upstages her ("Senior Year Spring Musical").  At the end of the musical, Ms. Darbus reveals that both Kelsi and Ryan have won the Juilliard scholarship and tells about everyone's future plans, in which Troy reveals he's chosen  [[University of California, Berkeley]] so he can be close to Gabriella where he can play basketball and perform in theater. Taylor reveals that she will be attending [[Yale University]] with honors to study Political Science, and Sharpay and Chad revealed they would attend the [[University of Albuquerque]], to study Performing Arts and for basketball, respectively. ("We're All in This Together").  At the graduation ceremony, Troy gives the class speech after being selected by Ms. Darbus. Throwing their caps in the air, the graduates form a giant "[[wildcat]]" before breaking out into song and dance ("High School Musical"). As the film ends, the graduates run across the field, the curtain falls, and they appear on the East High stage. The main cast performs the song, "High School Musical", before jumping and bowing when the curtain falls.

Home (2008 film)
 Marthe ([[Isabelle Huppert]]) and Michel ([[Olivier Gourmet]]) live with their three children in a house next to an uncompleted highway. They use the deserted road as an extension to their property. For example, they have an inflatable swimming pool and the son as well as his friends use the highway to ride their bicycles. They have been living for ten years close to the highway and believe that it will not be used. One day without warning, construction workers begin to upgrade the road and the highway becomes open to traffic. Instead of leaving the house, the family continue to live there, despite the increased noise from the passing traffic. It used to be the case that the father would simply walk across the highway in order to use his car to get to work. This becomes more complicated as the highway becomes increasingly used by motorists. He and his children eventually have to use a tunnel in order to gain access to the outside world.  Their younger daughter, Marion (Madeleine Budd), becomes obsessed about the quality and cleanliness of her surroundings. She monitors the grass as it exhibits evidence of carbon monoxide emissions and is convinced that the family will die prematurely, or may fall ill, as a consequence of living in such close proximity to the highway. The elder daughter, Judith (Adélaïde Leroux), continues to lead her life of sunbathing out on the front lawn in her bikini, despite attracting unwanted attention from passing motorists. One day she decides to leave the house and does not  return until some time later when, accompanied by a man who is apparently her boyfriend, she finds the house bricked-up and, after an unsuccessful attempt to find an entrance, leaves again.  Meanwhile, the remaining family start to sound-proof their house by bricking themselves into the home. This includes blocking up all the windows and sealing all the ventilation points so no sound can get in. Confined in their own home, the pressure begins to take its toll on the family and, in what appears to be a death dream, they break out of the house into the sunlit outdoors.  
The Hottie and the Nottie
 Nate Cooper is unable to get it together with women. But he also cannot forget his first crush: The attractive Cristabel Abbott, from their time in elementary school. Nate sets out for the beaches of [[California]] and meets up with his geeky best friend Arno, whose mother has an unnatural amount of information about Cristabel, and perhaps an unusual relationship with her son.  Cristabel jogs on the beach every day with many suitors trying to catch her eye, including an [[albino]] [[stalking|stalker]]. But she's still single, and there is a reason: Cristabel is still best friends with the same short, unattractive brunette girl whom Nate also knew in elementary school, June Phigg.  Nate reintroduces himself to Cristabel and they hit it off. However, Cristabel refuses to go on a date with Nate unless June has a date as well. Nate sets out to find a boyfriend for June, but men recoil at the sight of her. One day at the [[Santa Monica]] Pier, Johann Wulrich, an attractive dentist who works as a part-time model, appears in their lives. He seems to want to do a makeover on June when he apparently sees her inner beauty. However, Nate believes that Johann is a threat to his shot for Cristabel, since Johann is almost perfect. Eventually, with June dating Johann, Cristabel finally begins dating Nate, per his original plan.  Over the next few weeks, as Nate and June become friends and she emerges from her cocoon, with her face and appearance transforming into that of an attractive woman whose beauty begins to compare with Cristabel, Nate slowly realizes that ''June'' may be the girl of his dreams. Nate tells this to Cristabel, who is happy for June. Nate then tries to find June, and finds her, telling her how he feels.  
Horton Hears a Who! (film)
  A dust speck is dislodged from its obscure place and sent adrift through the Jungle of Nool. At the same time, Horton the elephant, the jungle's eccentric nature teacher, takes a dip in the pool. The dust speck floats past him in the air, and he hears a tiny yelp coming from it. Believing that an entire society of microscopic creatures are living on that speck, he gives chase to it before placing it on top of a clover. Horton finds out the speck harbors the city of [[Whoville]] and its inhabitants, the Whos, led by Mayor Ned McDodd.  He has a wife, Sally, 96 daughters (whose names all begin with the letter H), and one teenage son named JoJo. Despite being the oldest and next in line for the mayoral position, JoJo doesn't want to be the next mayor, and because he's so scared of disappointing his father, never talks. Once Horton begins carrying the speck with him, the city starts experiencing strange [[phenomena]] ([[earthquakes]] and changes in the [[weather]]), and the Mayor finds his attempts to caution Whoville challenged by the Town Council, led by the opportunistic yet condescending Chairman.  After he makes contact with Horton, the Mayor finds out from Dr. Mary Lou LaRue that Whoville will be destroyed if Horton does not find a "safer, more stable home". Horton resolves (with the help of his best friend Morton the mouse) to place the speck atop Mt. Nool, the safest place in the jungle. The head of the jungle, Jane Kangaroo, disbelieving Horton's beliefs and resenting him for overshadowing her authority, attempts several times to demand that Horton give up the speck, but Horton ignores her demands. Also taking force toward Horton are the Wickersham Brothers, a group of monkeys who love making misery. Eventually, the Kangaroo enlists a [[vulture]] named Vlad Vladikoff to get rid of the speck by force.  After a few failed attempts, Vlad manages to steal the clover away from Horton and drops it into a massive field of identical pink clovers, causing an apocalyptic tremor in Whoville. After unsuccessfully picking nearly three million clovers, Horton eventually recovers the clover (exactly the 3,000,000th clover). The Kangaroo eventually finds out, thanks to Mrs. Quilligan, that Horton still has the speck, and decides to rally the jungle community into fighting Horton, saying that Horton's goal will lead to anarchy. Upon cornering him, the Kangaroo offers Horton an escape from punishment by renouncing Whoville's existence.  Despite Horton's heartfelt speech when he refuses, the Kangaroo orders the animals to rope and cage him, and to have the speck and the Whos destroyed in a pot of boiling beezlenut oil. The Mayor enlists all of his people to make noise by shouting "We are here!", as well as playing a variety of instruments, so the animals may hear them, assisted by JoJo's "Symphonophone", an invention which creates a huge musical contribution (which reveals that JoJo's "true" passion is music), but still fails to penetrate the surface of the speck.  As Horton lies beaten and captured, the Kangaroo easily takes the clover, and drops it. Meanwhile, JoJo grabs the horn used to project Horton's voice, runs up the highest tower and screams "YOPP!", breaking through the sound barrier just seconds before the speck hits the oil.  The Kangaroo's son, Rudy grabs the clover and returns it to Horton. The animals finally hear the Whos, realizing the truth about the clover, and isolate the Kangaroo for tricking them. While being praised for his integrity by his neighbors, Horton even forgives the devastated Kangaroo, and she befriends him with a makeshift umbrella for Whoville. Here, the people of Whoville and the animals of Nool gather in song and recite the chorus from "[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]". The film ends with the narrator revealing that the Jungle of Nool, or rather [[Earth]], is just one speck, like Whoville, among numerous others, floating in outer space.  
House (2008 film)
 In the prologue, the film depicts a panicky man who, for unknown reasons, murders his wife with a shotgun. The main storyline opens with Jack and Stephanie, a bickering young couple, who are lost while driving through the backwoods. We soon learn that they are on their way to meet a marriage counselor.  After getting bad directions from a state trooper, the couple get into a car accident when they run over some spiked metal in the road, which Jack dismisses as discarded scrap metal; they find another car which has experienced the same fate, but the occupants are missing. Forced to proceed on foot, Jack and Stephanie find the gothic Wayside Inn, where they try to phone for help. At the inn, they meet the occupants of the other car, the engaged couple Leslie and Randy.  Because the phones are inoperative, both couples are forced to spend the night at the inn, which is staffed only by the eccentric proprieter Betty, her creepy son Pete (who develops an instant attraction for Leslie), and the gruff caretaker Stewart.  After a tense dinner, in which personalities clash, the group is terrorized by a legendary local figure, the Tin Man. Armed with a shotgun, the Tin Man attempts to get into the Wayside Inn. The staff locks the Tin Man out, and he responds by giving them a message scrawled on the side of a tin can. The message declares that he will kill everyone in the house unless they give him one dead body by sunrise. The staff, blaming their guests for attracting the Tin Man's attention, attempts to lock them in the freezing meat locker, threatening to leave them there for weeks. A fight ensues, and the guests realize that there is a supernatural presence in the house when Betty is injured in the struggle and bleeds black fog.  The couples escape the meat locker, but are unable to leave the house, which assaults them with terrifying visions involving their worst memories. For Jack and Stephanie, the visions involve their daughter, who died after falling through the ice in a skating accident. For Randy, the visions involve his abusive father. For Leslie, the visions involve an uncle named Pete, who sexually abused her when she was a little girl; these visions are intensified by the similar lusts of Pete who lives at the Wayside Inn.  Confused by the visions, the four guests find themselves separated. Jack meets Susan, a young girl who has been held captive by the staff. Susan reminds Jack of his deceased daughter, especially after she claims to have been in contact with her spirit; Susan assures Jack, and later Stephanie, that their daughter is in a good place.  Emotionally tormented by the visions, stalked by the homicidal Wayside staff, and under constant threat from the Tin Man, all four guests succumb to the various pressures and start to turn on each other. Shortly after they discover that the staff worships the Devil, Jack is split into two identical people; each seems to think of himself as the "real" Jack, yet each bleeds black mist when injured, making it impossible for anyone to figure out which is the real Jack and which is the [[doppelganger]].  The couples almost escape when they are aided by Officer Lawdale (the same state trooper who had given bad directions to Jack and Stephanie), but they are recaptured when Lawdale turns out to be working with the Wayside staff. Lawdale and the Wayside staff try to force the couples to appease the Tin Man by choosing one of themselves to kill. Past tensions initially lead the viewer to believe that Randy will resolve the situation by killing Jack, but he instead turns the gun on Susan. Jack deflects the gun but Susan is hit.  Desperate to appease the Tin Man, Leslie and Randy kill each other.  Lawdale reveals that he is the Tin Man, and that he and the Wayside staffers are all manifestations of pure evil. Jack and Stephanie defeat their captors by channeling the energy of pure good that is flowing from Susan's dead body.  Finally able to escape the inn, Jack and Stephanie trek back to their car, where they discover their unconscious bodies, as well as the dead bodies of Leslie and Randy; they realize that their entire experience at the inn was nothing more than a shared [[out of body experience]]. As Jack and Stephanie wake up and are taken away in an ambulance, they are watched over by a resurrected Susan, who observes that their love for each other has been reawakened by the events at the Wayside Inn.  As the couple ride off in an ambulance, Jack looks out the window to see Lawdale laughing at him from the front gate of the Wayside, with the caretakers watching out of an upstairs window.

The Horribly Slow Murderer with the Extremely Inefficient Weapon
 The movie itself is presented as being a trailer for a 9 hour long movie. It starts with a voice-over, telling the viewer that: ''"some murders take seconds; some murders take minutes; some murders take hours; this murder... will take years!"''.  The movie portrays the story of a [[forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] called Jack Cucchiaio (played by Paul Clemens; "cucchiaio" means spoon in Italian), who finds himself being haunted by a deranged looking man (Brian Rohan), who is, without any clear reason, hitting him with a spoon. No one seems to believe this though as the mysterious attacker only shows up when Jack is alone.  He is seen developing a phobia of spoons, stirring his coffee with a fork.  Jack attempts to defend himself - stabbing the murderer in the throat with a kitchen knife. But to Jack's surprise his enemy turns out to be immortal, pulling the knife out of his throat and throwing it away, then continuing to hit Jack with the spoon. However, in this scene Jack also notices a strange sign on the arm of his attacker.  Jack travels to the far East where he learns that his attacker is known as the Ginosaji ("silver spoon" in Japanese), an immortal and unstoppable being. After this, Jack is shown traveling around the world, trying to escape from the Ginosaji or to fight it. He uses various weapons, including dynamite, guns, and an RPG. Since the Ginosaji is immortal, however, he will always survive and find Jack again. The last scene shows a weakened, wounded Jack, crawling in the desert, with the Ginosaji still striking him with the spoon. Then, suddenly, the spoon breaks. However, Jack's final hope is brief as the Ginosaji opens his jacket and shows dozens of spoons. Finally, the title and credits are shown in typical trailer style.  
How to Lose Friends & Alienate People (film)
 Sidney Young, an aspiring British journalist who runs a failing polemical magazine, attempts to infiltrate a party organized by Clayton Harding ([[Jeff Bridges]]), the CEO of Sharps, one of the most prestigious magazines in the world. In doing so, he momentarily gains Clayton's sympathy, as the latter began his own career through polemics. Sidney is offered a job at Sharps, and moves to New York City, but he quickly earns the scorn of his colleagues, including Alison Olsen ([[Kirsten Dunst]]) and the manager Lawrence Maddox ([[Danny Huston]]), as a result of his rudeness, vulgarity, and general unattractiveness. He discovers that interviews with famous performers must be arranged by an influential publicist named Eleanor Johnson ([[Gillian Anderson]]), who imposes restrictions on published content, which offends Sidney, since he enjoys writing polemics. On one occasion, Sidney accidentally kills the dog of a rising actress named Sophie Maes ([[Megan Fox]]), to whom Sidney is intensely sexually attracted. To his fortune, Alison, who despises Sidney, agrees to help him conceal the mistake. Sidney gains Alison's respect by explaining his disapproval of Eleanor's practices, and Alison reveals that she also despises her job, and has been working sporadically on a novel for years, which she hopes to publish.  At a party, Sidney discovers that Alison was having an affair with Lawrence, but has chosen to end it. He is approached by Sophie, who has become drunk, but forfeits the chance to sleep with her, upon discovering that Alison is also drunk and needs to be driven. At his apartment, Alison meets Sidney's father, who turns out to be a well known philosophy professor, and a member of the nobility. Later, Sidney attempts to ask Alison on a date, but learns that she is reuniting with Lawrence, who has just divorced his wife, who is Clayton's daughter. Being heavily depressed, Sidney compromises his journalistic principles and begs to work with Eleanor. Not only does Eleanor agree, but Lawrence and Alison are pressured to leave by Clayton, as a result of Lawrence's divorce, leading to Sidney's promotion. Sidney works hard, writing to please others rather than to criticize, and earns several more promotions within a short time, as well as gaining access to the highest celebrities and most exclusive social gatherings.  On the night before a prestigious film-awards ceremony, Sidney attends an informal party led by Sophie, and is pressured into surrendering his golden ring, which was a gift from his late mother. He regains his contempt for high society, and the next evening, as Sophie is approaching the stage to claim her award, he seizes her and takes back the ring, and also curses her, revealing that he was the one who killed her dog. In response, Sophie attacks Sidney, attracting negative attention and ruining his reputation. Nonetheless, Sidney, who has quit his job with Sharps, and feels a slight confusion concerning his life's direction, seeks out Alison, who by now has separated with Lawrence, and the two of them begin a relationship.  
How to Be

His girlfriend ends their relationship. Art is then forced to move back home with his cold and neglectful parents (played by Pidgeon and Michael Irving). Art buys a book titled, ''It's Not Your Fault.'' Upon reading it, he tries to follow the self-help book's advice.

Humboldt County (film)
  Peter Hadley ([[Jeremy Strong (actor)]]) is an [[overachieving]] medical student at [[UCLA]]. He is given failing grades on his final exam by his professor, who also happens to be his father ([[Peter Bogdanovich]]). Unable to graduate, he becomes bitter and disillusioned. He then meets up with the actress who played the part of his patient in his final exam, the free-spirited part time jazz singer Bogart ([[Fairuza Balk]]). The two of them go back to her apartment after a night at a jazz club and have [[casual sex]]. Afterwards she gets up to go for a drive and asks Peter if he'd like to come, to which he agrees. The two of them drive north through the night and Peter eventually dozes off. When he wakes up, he finds that Bogart has driven all the way to [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt County]]. It is here that he meets her family. Jack ([[Brad Dourif]]) and Rosie ([[Frances Conroy]]) took her in when her family abandoned her, and they became her surrogate parents. He also meets Max ([[Chris Messina (actor)|Chris Messina]]), Jack and Rosie's son and Charity ([[Madison Davenport]]), Max's daughter.  After an uncomfortable night in which Peter finds out that they are all involved in growing [[Cannabis (drug)|pot]], he finally manages to go to sleep. The next morning he is woken up abruptly by Max. When he gets dressed, he finds out that Bogart has left. Stranded and unwilling to call his father for help, Peter's only choice is to take the bus, which won't come for another day. With nothing else to do, Max enlists him to help with his marijuana crop, which Peter reluctantly agrees to do. After a day of working on some irrigation problems, they relax back at Jack and Rosie's house. Bob and Steve (played by Directors Darren Grodsky and Danny Jacobs respectively), friends of Max, arrive bloodied and dirty. Some local [[wiktionary:hick|hicks]] found their garden, roughed them up and took their plants. The next day, Peter helps Max with his plants again. He becomes so focused on the work that he misses the bus. It is after this that he begins to bond with Max and the rest of his family. He quickly falls in love with the natural surroundings and the residents of the rural community and stops trying to leave. He begins to understand empathy and love (the thing he previously lacked, which caused him to fail his final exam in the first place). When Jack asks him what he plans to do after this, Peter is shocked to realize that he'd never considered an "after this".  His sudden fear that he would never leave is further solidified by a conversation that he has with Bob and Steve in a bar later that night. Steve explains that almost everyone who lives in Humboldt County now came from somewhere else and never left, including Rosie and Jack (who used to be a Physics professor at UCLA). He also reveals that he was in Peter's shoes a few years earlier; he was a student at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and followed a girl out to Humboldt county and never left. When Peter expresses doubts that their situations were similar, Steve also mentions that the girl he followed was Bogart. When they get up to leave, Bob refuses because he notices the guys that stole their plants sitting at a table behind them. While he and Steve argue about whether or not he's actually going to confront them, Peter drunkenly walks over and starts accusing the men and admonishing them for their cowardice. He then throws his drink in one of their faces and they all run out of the bar with the hicks in pursuit. They get away and are walking through the woods, laughing about what Peter had just done when Steve says that he wants to show them something. He takes them up to an unfamiliar area of the woods where there is a massive plantation, at least fifty plants. Steve and Bob start to steal a couple because they figured that no one would notice. At this time, Peter sees a sleeping bag on the ground just seconds before someone fires a shotgun at them. As they run away, Peter stops and looks back at the person chasing them, it is Max. It's revealed that this is his secret garden. Max is furious with Peter for trying to steal his plants and he yells at him to leave, brandishing the shotgun.  When Peter gets back to Jack's house, Jack is in the living room waiting for him. He confronts Peter and asks him how many plants Max has. At first, Peter is hesitant to answer, so Jack takes him out on a nature walk and explains to him the dangers of having more than a few plants. He believes that by growing only twenty plants, he makes enough to get by and keeps from attracting the ({[DEA]})'s attention. He warns Peter against letting greed run his life, because doing so destroys the entire reason they came out to the lost coast in the first place; to find salvation. After this, he goes to Max's trailer and asks him why he didn't tell him about the other plants. Max angrily fumes that he was planning on telling Peter as they got closer to harvest time. It's at this time that a federal SUV pulls up and Peter and Max are taken into custody. Peter is interrogated about Max's purchase history which includes fertilizer and water tubing, but he says nothing and they are let go due to a lack of any solid evidence against them. Afterwards Peter starts to question why he is still there. The next day, Jack has a [[Barbecue|BBQ]]. He confronts Max about his secret crop. Avoiding a direct question from Jack, Max instead mocks him, saying that the presence of the Federal police is probably due to their eagerness to steal Jack's extensive research on physics. Jack angrily storms off and Rosie begins to tell Peter about Max's real father. Jack, Rosie and her then-husband, Charlie were all friends when they worked as professors at UCLA and they decided to move to Humboldt County together.  However, eventually Charlie, who had been a long time alcoholic and drinking buddy of Jack's, died in a car accident while suffering from an episode of extreme [[delirium tremens|alcohol withdrawal]].  Peter decides that he can't be a part of Max's operation any more and he tries to leave. Max gets angry and tells him that this isn't a game and he can't back out, but Peter starts walking away anyway. Max then starts to cry and tells Peter that if he doesn't pull this off, Charity will end up just like him. While this affects Peter greatly, he continues to walk off. Charity then finds Peter crying by a tree and asks him what's wrong. He asks her what she wants to be when she grows up and she says an [[astronaut]]. When she asks him what he wants to be, he says that he no longer knows, and she says that that's all right, which comforts Peter.  The next day, Peter's father shows up at the house, using [[Last-call return|Star-69]] and [[MapQuest]] he managed to find where Peter was. After a brief visit with Jack and Rosie, where he is greatly put off to find that this is where his son has been all this time, he tells Peter that they're leaving, and Peter reluctantly goes with him despite his new-found bond with Jack and Rosie. As they're driving, his father tells Peter that he decided to pass him, but this news doesn't affect Peter much. He then sees Bob and Steve speeding down the road in the opposite direction, followed by Max and then by a federal helicopter. Peter realizes that they must have found Max's secret crop and are on their way to raid it. He gets out of the car and tells his father to head for the beach (advice that Max had told him earlier) and he runs off to stop Max from trying to save his crop.  Peter's father gets to the beach, where he finds Jack along with all of the other local pot farmers. He informs him that Peter took off. Jack hadn't seen Max anywhere and he connected the dots and headed off towards Max's crop. When Peter gets there, he finds Max trying to save as many of his plants before the DEA gets there and Peter begins to help. Then the feds show up and Peter and Max narrowly manage to hide themselves. Then Jack shows up and leads them both back to the beach, where Charity happily reunites with Max. Peter says that he's sorry to Max for his loss and Max tells him not to take it so seriously. That night, Max is at the bar drowning his sorrows when his drunken behavior gets him kicked out. He is then seen driving down the highway and laughing to himself. The scene then cuts to the next day when a sheriff shows up at Jack and Rosie's and informs them that Max is dead.  They then call Peter, who is staying at a hotel with his father, and tell him. He attends the funeral and afterwards finds Jack in his study, weeping to himself. Jack is ridden with guilt, he says that it was his idea to come up there and he blames himself for the death of Charlie and now Max. He breaks down saying that he has nothing left, but Peter then tells him that has so much left and that he had not yet reached the [[event horizon]] (a concept of physics that Jack describes to Peter as the point of no return). The ending is left up to the viewer for interpretation. It shows Peter and his father having breakfast at a diner before leaving back for [[Los Angeles]]. A bus then pulls up outside as one of the passengers needs to use the bathroom. Peter then gets up – his father apparently assuming he is going to the bathroom – and heads outside and gets on the bus, which then leaves when the other passenger gets back. Peter stares out at the landscape, not knowing where he's going and seemingly content with that.

The House Bunny
 Shelley Darlington ([[Anna Faris]]) is an aspiring [[Playboy Playmate]] living the life of luxury in the [[Playboy Mansion]]. The day after her 27th birthday, she awakes to find a note, seemingly from [[Hugh Hefner]], asking her to pack up and leave. She happens to stumble upon a group of girls who remind her of herself: beautiful and fun. She follows them and sees that they live in luxury too. They turn out to be the Phi Iota Mu [[sorority]], and snobbishly reject her when she tries to join them.  She makes her way down to the Zeta Alpha Zeta house, which appears to be far less luxurious than the first sorority she visited. The members of the Zeta house are dowdy, socially awkward, and caught off guard by Shelley's bubbly nature, prompting them to initially reject her. Once they see Shelley's ability to attract boys, the Zetas change their mind and take in Shelley as their new "[[house mother]]", hoping that she can save them: their sorority is in danger of being shut down unless they can get thirty new pledges to join.  During her time spent with the Zetas, Shelley meets and becomes attracted to an intellectual, altruistic guy named Oliver ([[Colin Hanks]]), who works at a [[retirement home]]. Shelley goes out on a date with Oliver, and while her flirty tactics work with most guys, they fail with him, for he is a guy who actually wants to get to know Shelley rather than just sleep with her. To impress Oliver on their upcoming second date, Shelley starts attending classes and reading books, and tones down her appearance. The second date is also a disaster because she wears glasses that aren't meant for her, and brings along note cards to help her sound smart.  Having gotten a makeover and lessons on how to attract guys and be popular, the Zetas throw a party, which is a huge success. Later, the Zetas are reviewing the girls who are hoping to pledge to Zeta, but their new popularity has made them conceited. When they realize what they've become, they blame Shelley—just as she returns from her unsuccessful date.  Although Shelley had just been invited back to the Playboy Mansion (after Hefner had learned of the forged dismissal) and decided to stay with the Zetas, the unexpected attack from them makes her reconsider, and she calls back to accept the invitation. The Zetas then feel guilty, and decide to give themselves a second makeover, this time being "Half-Shelley and Half-Themselves". They also decide to draw the pledges out at random, instead of judging them. They show up at Shelley's photo shoot and ask for her to come back, to which she agrees, having changed her mind about her dream of being a centerfold.  The rival Phi Iota Mu sorority intercepts the invitations and prevents them from being mailed out, so the Zetas are again in danger of being shut down at the campus meeting of the [[Panhellenic Council]].

Finally one night, Raj goes down to investigate and discovers that it is the night watchman blowing the whistle periodically in the night to scare thieves away. Raj scolds the watchman and forbids him from making any further noise but the secretary, Janardan ([[Rajat Kapoor]]) insists on the whistling continuing for building security. Raj goes to the police station and filed a complaint.But the secretary sweet talks to the police officers and they told Raj that it was necessary to make those noises for security.The secretary decided that the whistling will begin 11:00 pm to 11:30 pm, 12:00 am to 12:30 am,01:00 am to 01:30 am,etc.  An issue that starts out lightly and amusingly trivial begins to escalate to take the shape of a serious problem for Raj. He begins to slowly go to pieces. Not being able to sleep at night begins to take a serious toll on him, both professionally and personally. At work, he becomes edgy and his usual smart sense of judgment suffers. At home, he becomes obsessed with any loud noises in the environment.

At the end, Raj due to lack of sleep by mistake sells a share in bulk in which the secretary had invested and both incur heavy losses. It was shown that Raj was supposed to move to a new apartment with Abha but Abha was sad that she left the old apartment and she went to her dad's house.On their way to their destined place,the watchman is no longer a watchman and is now a beggar.

The Hurt Locker
 In 2004, [[Sergeant First Class]] William James, a former [[75th Ranger Regiment|U.S. Army Ranger]], arrives as the new team leader of a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Bomb disposal|Explosive Ordnance Disposal]] (EOD) unit in the [[Iraq War]]. He replaces [[Staff sergeant#United States|Staff Sergeant]] Matthew Thompson, who was killed by an [[improvised explosive device]] (IED) in [[Baghdad]]. His team includes Sergeant J. T. Sanborn and [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] Owen Eldridge.  James is often approached by an Iraqi youth nicknamed "Beckham" attempting to sell DVDs. James challenges him to a game of soccer and takes a liking to him.  Sanborn and Eldridge consider James' maverick disposal methods and attitude reckless, raising tensions.  When they are assigned to destroy explosives, James returns to the detonation site to pick up his gloves. Sanborn openly contemplates killing him by "accidentally" triggering the explosives, making Eldridge uncomfortable.  Nothing is done and tensions continue to increase.  Returning to [[Camp Victory]] in their [[Humvee]], the team encounters five armed men in traditional Arab garb and casual attire standing near a [[Ford Excursion]], which has a flat tire. James' team has a tense encounter with their leader, who reveals that they are [[Private military company|private military contractors]] and British [[Mercenary|mercenaries]]. They have captured two prisoners featured on the [[most-wanted Iraqi playing cards]]. The group comes under fire; when the prisoners attempt to escape in the confusion, the leader of the mercenaries shoots them, as they are valuable dead or alive. Enemy snipers kill three of the mercenaries, including their leader. Sanborn and James borrow a gun to dispatch three attackers, while Eldridge kills a fourth.  During a raid on a warehouse, James discovers a body he believes is Beckham, in which a bomb has been surgically implanted. During evacuation, [[Lieutenant colonel|Lieutenant Colonel]] John Cambridge, the camp's [[psychiatrist]] and a friend of Eldridge, is killed in an explosion; Eldridge blames himself for his death. James breaks into the house of an Iraqi professor, seeking revenge for Beckham, but his search reveals nothing.  Called to a petrol tanker detonation, James decides to hunt for the insurgents responsible, guessing they are still nearby. Sanborn protests, but when James begins a pursuit, he and Eldridge reluctantly follow. After they split up, insurgents capture Eldridge. James and Sanborn rescue him but accidentally shoot him in the leg. The following morning, James is approached by Beckham, who he believed was dead, and walks by silently. Before being airlifted for surgery, Eldridge angrily blames James for his injury.  James and Sanborn's unit is called to another mission in their last two days of their rotation. An innocent Iraqi civilian has had a bomb vest strapped to his chest. James tries to cut off the locks to remove the vest, but there are too many of them. He abandons the man, who is killed when the bomb explodes. Sanborn is distraught by the man's death. He confesses to James that he can no longer cope with the pressure, and wants to return home and have a son.  After Bravo Company's rotation ends, James returns to his ex-wife Connie and their infant son, who still live with him in his house. However, he is bored by routine civilian life. James confesses to his son that there is only one thing that he knows he loves. He starts another tour of duty, serving with Delta Company, a U.S. Army EOD unit on its 365-day rotation.  
Hunger (2008 film)
 Prison officer Raymond Lohan prepares to leave work; he cleans his bloodied knuckles, checks his car for bombs, puts his uniform on, and ignores his comrades.  Davey Gillen, a new [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] prisoner, arrives; he is categorised as a "non-conforming prisoner" for his refusal to wear the prison uniform. He is sent to his cell naked with only a blanket. His cellmate, Gerry Campbell, has smeared the walls with faeces from floor to ceiling as part of the [[no wash protest]]. The two men get to know each other and are seen living within the cell. Gerry's girlfriend sneaks a radio in by wrapping it and storing it in her vagina.  Prison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, grown as part of the no-wash protest. The prisoners resist, Sands spitting into Lohan's face, who responds by punching him in the face and then swings again, only to miss and punch the wall, causing his knuckles to bleed. He cuts Sands' hair and beard; the men throw Sands in the bathtub and scrub him clean before hauling him away again. Lohan is then seen smoking a cigarette, as in the opening scenes, his hand bloodied.  Later, the prisoners are taken out of their cells and given second-hand civilian clothing. The guards are seen snickering as they are handed to the prisoners who respond, after Sands' initial action, by tearing up the clothes and wrecking their cells. For the next interaction with the prisoners, a large number of riot police are seen coming into the prison on a truck. They line up and beat their batons against their shields and scream to scare the prisoners, who are hauled from their cells, then forced to [[run the gauntlet]] between the lines of riot police where they are beaten with the batons by at least 10 men at once. Lohan and several of his colleagues then probe first their anuses and then their mouths, using the same pair of latex gloves for each man. One prisoner head-butts a guard and is beaten brutally by a riot officer. One of the riot officers is seen crying while his colleagues, on the other side of the wall, brutally beat the prisoners with their batons.  Lohan visits his catatonic mother in a retirement home. He is shot in the back of the head by an IRA assassin and dies slumped onto his mother's lap.  Sands meets Father Dominic Moran and discusses the morality of a [[hunger strike]]. Sands tells the priest about a trip to [[County Donegal|Donegal]] where he and his friends found a [[foal]] by a stream that had cut itself on the rocks and broken its back legs. Sands drowned the foal and tells the priest, although he got into trouble, he knew he had done the right thing by ending its suffering. He then says he knows what he is doing and what it will do to him, but he says he will not stand by and do nothing. The rest of the film shows Sands well into his hunger strike, with weeping sores all over his body, kidney failure, low blood pressure, stomach ulcers, and the inability to stand on his own by the end. In the last days, while Sands lies in a bath, a larger orderly comes in to give his usual orderly a break. The larger orderly sits next to the tub and shows Sands his knuckles, which are tattooed with the letters "[[Ulster Defence Association|UDA]]". Sands tries to stand on his own and eventually does so with all his strength, staring defiantly at the UDA orderly who refuses to help him up, but then he crumbles in a heap on the floor with no strength left to stand. The orderly carries him to his room. Sands' parents stay for the final days, his mother being at his side when Sands dies, 66 days after beginning the strike.  The film explains that Sands was elected to the United Kingdom Parliament as [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] while he was on strike. Nine other men died with him during the seven-month strike before it was called off. 16 prison officers were killed by paramilitaries throughout the protests depicted in the film. Shortly afterwards, the British government conceded in one form or another to virtually all of the prisoners' five demands despite never officially granting political status.  
Hush (2008 film)
  Zakes ([[William Ash (actor)|William Ash]]) and his girlfriend Beth ([[Christine Bottomley]]) are driving along the rain-drenched M1 motorway at night, stopping at every service station so he can put up posters in the restrooms as part of his job. Tired and irritable, the two bicker continuously about their fragile relationship along the way. Beth is eager to tell Zakes she has recently cheated on him but can't find the right moment.  Beth soon falls asleep in the passenger seat. Moments later, failing to spot their exit, Zakes carelessly cuts up a large white truck, skids in the road and barely avoids a collision. The truck then violently overtakes Zakes before they come to a stop in traffic. As it does, the tailgate of the truck flips up, revealing a naked woman bound and bloodied in a cage, screaming for help. Before there is time for Zakes to get a cloeser look, the door is slammed shut.  Panicked, he wakes Beth up, telling her what he saw. They immediately call the police but are unable to tell them the number plate as it is covered in dirt. They describe the truck and where they are, and the police say they will take care of it. While stuck in the queue of traffic, Zakes gets out of his car and goes up to the truck. He manages to slide his hand underneath and take a photograph using Beth's phone, but it appears to be nothing but a white blur from the flash. As the traffic starts moving, the truck drives away and Zakes refuses to follow it as he has one last stop to make. Beth is furious and another argument arises, as she claims that he takes no responsibility and isn't bothered about anything other than himself and his job that he hates.  At the last service station stop, Beth tearfully ends the relationship and walks away. She calls her friend to come and collect her. Believing she will change her mind, Zakes decides to wait in the car for her. He then sees the truck from before pull up and watches a man in a dark, hooded jacket get out and go inside. Zakes follows minutes later to try and find Beth, but she is nowhere to be seen. While checking inside the women's restroom, he is thrown out by two security guards. He tries to explain that he is only looking for his missing girlfriend but they don't believe him. Zakes then finds Beth's necklace in the staff car park round the back of the station and believes she has been taken by the man in the truck, which has now left. Deciding to follow it, he returns to his car to find his tyre has been punctured by a group of rowdy football fans. Zakes steals a car from the station and starts driving.  Meanwhile, one of the security guards decides to look through the CCTV footage from that night to see if Zakes was telling the truth. He finds footage of Beth entering the station by herself and sees that she leaves through the back door with a man in a hooded jacket. Suddenly, he is killed by the other security guard, who is shown to be connected with the kidnapping as he calls the driver of the truck and warns him that Zakes is probably following.  At the truck stop, Zakes flees from the car and enters the site on foot. It is full of white trucks that all look identical. A police car then arrives and the officer arrests Zakes, believing he is trespassing. Handcuffed in the back of the car, Zakes explains what he is believes has happened to Beth and begs the police officer to check all of the trucks before they go. When the officer does, he is attacked and killed by the hooded man, which Zakes witnesses. He manages to escape from the car and runs into the woods nearby, followed by the man. He arrives back at the service station but Zakes knows he can't call the police for help as they believe he is a criminal, so he steals another car and drives it back to the site, adamant Beth has been taken there.  He parks up nearby to catch his breath. Suddenly, a bloody woman comes to the window, claiming she has been kidnapped and is in need of help. Zakes lets her into the car but tells her he needs to find his girlfriend. His phone battery then dies. Zakes remembers he saw a farm house not too far away, so he decides to drive there in order to call for help, now he has a witness who can back up his story. The elderly couple living there cautiously invite them in, and offer them a cup of tea and the chance to clean themselves up while they wait for help. The woman Zakes picked up offers to call the police but cuts the phone line beforehand, revealing that she too is part of the plan. She then calls the hooded man, telling him she will take care of Zakes.  The woman cuts the power in the house, kills the elderly couple and then attacks Zakes. He wakes up with his hands nailed to the floorboards, and realises the woman isn't who she said she was. He manages to get free just as she is ready to kill him, stabbing her in the eye with one of the nails. Bleeding and exhausted, he then takes her mobile phone and heads back to the truck site. The area has a security system triggered by anyone that crosses the intersecting red lasers. The elderly couple's dog triggers the system, causing the area's flood lights to come on. The truck driver investigates and finds only the dog, which he immediately kills off screen. Zakes, who was hiding in the truck, comes out once the coast is clear, and he manages to get to safety before the security system resets.  Outside, he finds Beth chained up in a cage. Frantic, she tells Zakes the keys are with the man, who is showering in a nearby shedhouse. Zakes quietly goes inside and finds several other women locked up and gagged, who beg for his help. He manages to get the set of keys from the man's clothes on the bathroom floor and returns to Beth to help her escape first, promising he will be back to help the others. It appears the women are being used for [[human trafficking]]. While trying to find the right key, they hear the man coming and Zakes has to flee. A cat-and-mouse game soon begins when the man realises he is hiding in the site somewhere. He calls the woman's phone, which Zakes has on him, and follows the ring to where he is. However, Zakes has left the phone on the seat on an empty truck and is hiding in the forklift nearby. When the man steps into the right spot, Zakes pushes a button in the vehicle, and the crane releases a heavy load onto the attacker, crushing him instantly.  Zakes then runs back to help Beth who has already freed herself using the screwdriver he gave her. The pair reunite, sobbing with relief.    One year later, at a truck stop, a driver (who appears to be the security guard that assisted the killer) is seen picking out a book with the title "Traffic" on the cover. It seems Zakes has written a non-fiction story based on the events he and Beth went through. The driver purchases the book and goes to his truck in the parking lot and drives off.  
I Can See You (film)
 In an infomercial, Mickey Hauser, a spokesperson for Clara Clean Corporation, advertises Claractix, a cleaning product.  Ben Richards attempts to finish a portrait of a man in a suit, but he can not visualize the face, which remains blank.  After several attempts, he gives up and shaves off his beard.  When he meets with his coworkers, radio and newspaper reports reveal that Hauser has died and that Clara Clean Corporation has become involved in an ecological scandal.  Richards and his coworkers have been recruited to come up with an ecologically-themed advertising campaign to counter this scandal, but Doug Quaid rejects all of John Kimble's stock photography.  Ben suggests that they go to a Delaware campsite to seek inspiration and take their own photographs.  Meanwhile, Sonia Roja's boss tells her that her boyfriend, Kimble, has one week to come up with a fantastic advertising campaign.  Unless it is fantastic, Roja will take the fall.  Quaid, too, feverishly repeats that the campaign must be fantastic.  Richards, Quaid, Kimble, and Roja set off for the campsite.  On the way, Kimble receives a phone call from Ivan, who invites them to a barbecue.  Kimble tells Richards that a mysterious person will be there along with them, though he refuses to reveal who.  When they arrive, Quaid unsuccessfully flirts with Roja, who is more interested in her cell phone than him, and Richards takes some photographs, all of which come out distorted.  At Ivan's barbecue, Richards sees Summer Day, an acquaintance upon whom he once had a crush.  Encouraged by Quaid, Richards approaches her, and they embrace.  Richards and Day go off into the woods on their own and have sex, though Richards later denies to Quaid that they had sex.  The next day, Richards and Day go swimming.  Quaid teases Richards about going into the water with his glasses on, and Richards removes his glasses, which leaves his vision blurred and unfocused.  In the water, Richards fumbles in conversation with Day, and she wanders off into the wilderness with Quaid.  Kimble dismisses Richards' concerns when Quaid and Day do not return, and Roja denies Kimble's insistence that something is bothering her.  Kimble encourages Richards to take more photographs, but they turn out to be similarly distorted.  Hauser critiques Richards' photography and suggests that his camera's lens may need cleaning.  Disturbed by the camera's malfunction and his hallucination, Richards returns to camp and recruits a reluctant Kimble to search for Quaid and Day.  The two wander through the forest, where they find Day's underwear, blood on a rock, and a [[memory card]]; however, they locate no sign of Quaid or Day.  They give up and head back to the camp.  While viewing the images on the memory card, Kimble's laptop malfunctions, and the images are destroyed.  Roja complains of hearing voices and eerie sounds in the forest, but Kimble reacts skeptically, and they all go to sleep.  Richards has a strange dream or vision involving a musical number performed by Quaid and Day.  When he awakens, Quaid has returned to the camp, disoriented and manic.  Roja watches over Quaid as Kimble and Richards check the camp; disturbed by Quaid's behavior, Roja calls for assistance, and Quaid bolts into the forest.  Richards chases after Quaid, and, in the light, finds blood on Quaid's hands.  Quaid runs off again, and Richards finds his body at the bottom of a cliff.  Hauser appears and tells Richards to take a second look at the cliff, this time without his glasses; he does and throws his glasses over the edge.  He is then approached by a corpse-like Day, upon whom he can not focus.  Richards hallucinates extensively, and, upon returning to the camp, he discovers that Kimble has murdered Roja.  Richards puts out Kimble's eyes, opens his skull, and extracts a serrated knife from Kimble's head.  He hallucinates further and cuts out the face from his father's portrait.

 The film follows Bixby and Walker who describe systematically four serious deficits shaping the U.S. economy: budget, savings, the balance of payments, and leadership.

I Sell the Dead
 While awaiting his execution for murder and [[grave robbery]], Arthur Blake ([[Dominic Monaghan]]) is visited by Father Duffy ([[Ron Perlman]]), who wishes to obtain a statement from the condemned to be used as a [[cautionary tale]]. Arthur denies that he is a murderer, a crime for which his former partner, Willie Grimes ([[Larry Fessenden]]), has already been executed by [[guillotine]]. However, Blake freely admits to being a grave robber, and begins to recount his career with Willie.  Arthur became Willie's apprentice following the death of Blake's father, forcing the young man to find a job to support his family. Willie quickly taught him the skills necessary to steal corpses, both from graves as well as more risky locations, such as [[wake (ceremony)|wakes]]. The job proved profitable on its face, but both Arthur and Willie's ability to make money was severely hampered by the interference of Doctor Quint ([[Angus Scrimm]]), who frequently [[blackmail]]ed the two into obtaining corpses for free under threat of notifying the police of their activities. This blackmail continued for numerous years.  Willie and Arthur's career changed abruptly when procuring another corpse for Quint. Digging up a corpse [[Burial#Burial at cross-roads|buried at a cross-roads]], the two were confused when they found a [[garlic]] wreath around the body's neck and a wooden stake in its chest. Arthur dismissed these things as [[superstition]], and removed them against Willie's protests. Moments later, while the two were clearing their cart, the dead woman rose and walked away. Willie and Arthur attempted to flee, but came across the undead woman, who attacked Arthur. Willie was able to fend her off briefly with a shovel, and when she attacked him he managed to plunge the stake back into her chest, causing her to go immediately limp. Willie and Arthur delivered the staked body to Doctor Quint and departed quickly. The doctor removed the stake, awakening the undead woman, who killed him.  Freed of their blackmailer and now aware of a new market for their skills, Arthur and Willie shifted their career towards the supernatural side of grave robbing. During one such job (retrieving a body resembling a [[Grey alien]]) they were stopped by Cornelius Murphy, main spokesperson for the House Murphy, an infamous and vicious band of grave robbers led by Cornelius' unseen father, Samuel. Cornelius demanded the body at knifepoint; though Willie advised him to cooperate, Arthur refused, and the three scuffled over the body until it vanished in a burst of light.  At this point in Arthur's narrative, Father Duffy asks him if he had any further encounters with the House Murphy. Arthur is reluctant to speak of the matter, but finally relents, discussing the next—and last—time he encountered the Murphys.  Drinking at a local pub with their new apprentice (and Arthur's girlfriend) Fanny, Arthur and Willie received word from pub owner Ronnie about a possible job: a local mortuary had been reported as receiving crated shipments of the undead. However, their most recent shipment was incomplete, two of the crates lost in a shipwreck and believed to be located on a nearby island. The catch was that the mortuary had already hired someone to retrieve the missing undead: House Murphy. Willie and Arthur initially turned down the job, not wishing to cross paths with the Murphys, but at Fanny's insistence the two reluctantly agreed.  On the island the crates, are guarded by Bulger, House Murphy's enforcer. Fanny slit his throat (to Arthur and Willie's surprise), then the three rounded up one of the undead, Willie suffering a bite during the effort. Before they could get to the second, Fanny was killed by a knife thrown by Cornelius, who then tied the remaining two to the cage containing the captured undead. The two were only saved from death when the captured undead tore free of its cage and attacked Valentine, House Murphy's disfigured female assassin. Cornelius attempted to save Valentine, only to be attacked by the second undead. Willie and Arthur freed themselves, then escaped in the confusion. Afterward, the two argued bitterly over the botched job, resulting in the end of their partnership, and friendship. A week later, the two were arrested.  At the conclusion of the tale, Father Duffy asks whether it was Arthur or Willie who murdered Cornelius, but Arthur reiterates that the two simply left him to his fate. When Father Duffy expresses a surprising amount of anger at this, as well as the sentiment that Willie was "lucky" to have been killed before Duffy could meet him, Arthur realizes the priest's true identity: Samuel Murphy. The elder Murphy then attempts to kill Arthur with a [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]], but, before he can, he is struck down by an unseen rescuer. When he is able to look up, Arthur is surprised to discover his rescuer is Willie—more accurately, the decapitated body of Willie.

Igor (film)
 The Kingdom of Malaria's environment is devastated by a mysterious storm. Its ruler, King Malbert ([[Jay Leno]]), then [[blackmail]]s the rest of the world to pay the town not to unleash the various [[doomsday device]]s invented by its Evil Scientists. They, in turn, are assisted by [[Igor (fictional character)|Igors]], while the kingdom's annual Evil [[Science Fair]] showcases the scientists' latest weapons. One Igor ([[John Cusack]]), however, who serves the somewhat tedious-minded Doctor Glickenstein ([[John Cleese]]), is a talented inventor who aspires to be an Evil Scientist himself. Among his inventions are his friends, Scamper ([[Steve Buscemi]]), a re-animated, immortal rabbit with a death wish, and Brain ([[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]]), an unintelligent robot with a human brain transplanted into a [[life support]] jar.  When the malfunctioning invention explodes and decimates Glickenstein, Igor sees his chance. With Brain and Scamper's help, he assembles a huge and monstrous being from human remains (Molly Shannon). When he brings his creation to life, however, he discovers that the "Evil Bone" he gave her was not activated, making the monster sweet, friendly and gentle despite her hideous appearance. Igor tries to convince the monster that she is evil, but fails.  Igor attempts to [[mind control|brainwash]] the monster into becoming evil by bringing her to a brainwashing salon where people are hooked into a machine and shown monster movies for a few hours. Brain also gets the same thing in order to watch TV, but breaks the remote to his TV, so he takes the remote for the monster's room and in an attempt to change the channel he inadvertently changes the monster's TV channel from the horror movie marathon to a talk show whose topic of the day is the history of acting. She ends up watching the talk show for several hours, and upon leaving the salon, she can speak English and wants to be an actress. Igor then takes her back to the castle in the car.  On the way back to the castle, Igor's nemesis Dr. [[Schadenfreude]] ([[Eddie Izzard]]) and his girlfriend, Jaclyn ([[Jennifer Coolidge]]) try to steal the monster by using a shrink ray to shrink them all, but are shrunk instead. When Brain rambles on about how he changed the channel for the monster's TV, Igor attempts to murder Brain with an axe. Scamper sarcastically tells the monster they’re practicing for a play and she believes that they're performers. Igor decides to exhibit his monster at the science fair by telling her that the fair is an "[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]" audition, with a few differences.  Dr. Schadenfreude learns of the monster's existence and attempts to steal her. When that fails, he exposes Igor to King Malbert, who sends Igor to an "Igor Recycling Plant." Schadenfreude activates the monster's Evil Bone and unleashes her on the Science Fair, where she destroys all the Evil Inventions whilst singing "Annie" songs. Scamper and Brain help Igor escape and they learn that Malbert had deliberately killed Malaria's crops with a weather ray that made storm clouds so he could implement his "Evil Inventions" plan, thereby keeping himself in power. Rushing into the arena, Igor reasons with his enraged monster to deactivate her Evil Bone and allowing her to regain her sweet personality, while Scamper and Brain power down the weather ray, which falls and crushes Malbert to death.   Dr. Schadenfreude attempts to take power, but the citizens revolt upon learning of Malbert's deception and the monster humiliates him. The monarchy has been dissolved and Malaria becomes a [[republic]], with Igor as the president. Schadenfreude is relegated to pickle salesman, while the annual Science Fair becomes an annual [[musical theater]] showcase. Igor and his monster live happily together as Malaria becomes a better place.  
I've Loved You So Long
 When Juliette Fontaine, formerly a doctor, is released from prison, her younger sister Léa invites her to stay with her family – including her husband, his mute father, and their two adopted Vietnamese daughters – in their home in the university town of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]. Why Juliette was in prison is revealed slowly throughout the film: first, that she was in prison for 15 years, then that her crime was murder, then that the victim was her 6-year-old son Pierre, and finally the reason why she killed him.  Léa, a college professor of literature, is considerably younger than Juliette. Because of the nature of Juliette's crime, their parents denied Juliette's existence and refused to allow Léa to visit her. In addition, Juliette had refused to speak throughout her trial. As a result, Léa knows nothing about the circumstances surrounding the crime and, when pressed for details, Juliette refuses to discuss what happened until the end of the film.  While struggling to find employment, Juliette enjoys platonic companionship with two men, a probation officer who understands how prison can damage the human spirit, and Michel, one of Léa's colleagues, who is sympathetic to her ordeal of having been imprisoned.  Gradually, Juliette begins to fit in with Léa and her family, makes friends, and finds a permanent job as a secretary at a hospital.  She also develops a close relationship with her young nieces, much to the distress of their father, who is concerned about their safety while in their aunt's presence.  Slowly, after seeing how she interacts with the family, he begins to accept her.  Juliette agrees to accompany Léa on a visit to their mother, who is confined to a nursing home with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. For a brief moment the woman recognizes and embraces her, remembering her as a little girl rather than the estranged daughter who murdered her grandson.  Léa accidentally discovers a clue to why Juliette killed Pierre. Juliette diagnosed her son as suffering from a fatal and painful disease.  Léa confronts Juliette with what she learned, and Juliette explains that, when Pierre's condition progressed so that he could barely move, Juliette killed him with an injection, knowing that otherwise he would suffer unbearable pain.  At the trial she spoke no word of defense or explanation, feeling that she deserved punishment for bringing her son into the world, condemned to die. After a cathartic, emotional scene between the two sisters, Léa looks at a window and comments on how beautiful the rain is. Juliette agrees, and the film ends with Juliette saying, "I am here."

Toma goes with Kotaro's reformed father to the Bankito hideout and saves Ichi. Banki swore revenge. While recovering, Ichi explained that she is searching for Zatoichi because she wanted to see him one last time before she commits suicide. Toma is able to convince her to give up the idea. Later, while she sleeps recovering from her injuries, Toma leaves her to go help the Shirakawa fight the Bankito. When Ichi wakes up Kotaro tells her about the fight that's going on in the town.

Ray is attracted to Chloë, a local drug dealer moonlighting as a [[production assistant]]. He takes her to a restaurant, where he gets into an argument with a Canadian couple (mistaking them for Americans) and ends up knocking them unconscious. Chloë takes Ray to her apartment where they begin to have sex, but her ex-boyfriend Eirik appears and threatens Ray with a handgun. Ray disarms him and fires the gun, loaded with [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]], in Eirik's face, blinding him in one eye. Chloë admits that she and Eirik rob tourists, but insists she had told Eirik that Ray was not a target. Ray and Ken spend a debauched night with the dwarf actor, Jimmy, who takes [[cocaine]] and rants about a coming war between blacks and whites.  Harry calls Ken and orders him to kill Ray, on the principle that killing a child, even accidentally, is unforgivable. With a handgun supplied by Harry's local contact Yuri, Ken tracks Ray to a park and reluctantly prepares to kill him. Ray, however, distraught at his killing of the boy, prepares to kill himself with Eirik's loaded gun. Seeing this, Ken stops Ray, informs him of Harry's order and tells him to leave Bruges to make a new start elsewhere. He gives Ray some money and puts him on a train to another city, while confiscating his gun to prevent a further suicide attempt. Ken reports back to Harry, who immediately sets out for Bruges, enraged at the disobedience. He picks up a gun at Yuri's, and Eirik, Yuri's son, learns of his intention.  On the train, Ray is identified by the Canadian couple he assaulted in the restaurant and is escorted by the police back to Bruges. Chloë bails him out and the two share a drink on the market square beneath the [[Belfry of Bruges]]. Harry arrives in Bruges and rushes through the streets towards Ray's hotel, but spots Ken sitting outside a cafe. As the two have a drink, Harry boasts that if he himself had killed a child, he would have immediately taken his own life. Ken argues that Ray has the capacity to change and deserves a chance at [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]]. Harry is unconvinced, so Ken suggests they ascend the bell tower. At the top, Harry pulls his handgun on Ken, but Ken refuses to resist. Confused, Harry cannot bring himself to kill Ken, so he shoots him in the leg as punishment for not killing Ray. Seeing Ray at the square, Eirik climbs the tower to inform Harry, who is helping Ken down the tower. Ken tries to disarm Harry, who shoots him in the neck and rushes down. Bleeding heavily, Ken drags himself back to the top of the tower and jumps into the square. Ray rushes to Ken's mangled body and learns of Harry's arrival. Just before he dies, Ken tells him to take his gun, but it has been broken in the fall.  Harry chases Ray to the hotel; Marie, the pregnant owner, refuses Harry entry, even when he draws his gun. To protect the owner and her unborn child, Harry and Ray agree to continue the chase on the canal and Ray jumps onto a passing barge. Harry wounds Ray with a shot from a distance. Ray staggers onto the street where Jimmy's film is shooting. Harry catches up and repeatedly shoots Ray until he collapses. One of the bullets hits Jimmy (costumed as a schoolboy), blowing his head apart. Harry believes he has killed a child and, despite protest from Ray, kills himself. Ray is carried past Chloë, Marie and Eirik into an ambulance. In narration, Ray reflects on the nature of hell, comparing it to the city of Bruges, and declares that he really hoped he wouldn't die.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
  In 1957, [[Indiana Jones]] and his partner [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#Mac|George "Mac" McHale]] are kidnapped by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agents under [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#Irina Spalko|Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko]], who infiltrate a warehouse labeled "[[Area 51|Warehouse 51]]" and force Jones to locate a mummified corpse recovered [[Roswell UFO incident|from a crash site]]. Upon its discovery, Mac reveals he is a [[double agent]] working for the Soviets. Jones escapes and unsuccessfully attempts to retrieve the body. After a fight with Spalko's sadistic henchman, [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Antonin Dovchenko|Colonel Antonin Dovchenko]], Jones escapes to a model town at the [[Nevada Test Site]] minutes before an atomic bomb test, and takes shelter in a lead-lined refrigerator. Jones is rescued, decontaminated, and apprehended by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI agents]], who suspect him of working for the Soviets; though freed on the recommendation of [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#General Ross|General Ross]], who vouches for him, he is put on indefinite [[leave of absence]] from Marshall College. His leaving also causes the dean's resignation to keep Indiana's job at the college.  Jones is approached by [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]] Mutt Williams, who tells him that [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#Harold Oxley|Harold Oxley]] had found a crystal skull in Peru, suffered a [[mental breakdown]] and was later kidnapped. Jones tells Mutt about the legend of crystal skulls found in Akator. Mutt gives Jones a letter from his mother, who is also held captive, containing a riddle written by Oxley in an ancient South American language. KGB agents attempt to capture them, but Jones and Mutt escape them and reach Peru. At the local psychiatric hospital, Oxley's scribbles on the walls and floor of his cell lead them to the grave of [[Francisco de Orellana]], a [[Conquistador]] who searched for Akator. They discover the skull at the grave, with Jones reasoning that Oxley had returned it there.  Jones and Mutt are captured by Mac and the Soviets and taken to their camp in the Amazon jungle, where they find Oxley and Mutt's mother, [[Marion Ravenwood]], who reveals that Mutt is Jones's son, Henry Jones III. Spalko believes the crystal skull belongs to an alien life form and holds great [[psychic]] power, and that finding more skulls in Akator will grant the Soviets the advantage of psychic warfare. Spalko uses the skull on Jones to enable him to understand Oxley and identify a route to Akator. Jones and his four allies escape with the skull, but Marion and Jones get caught into a [[Dry quicksand|dry sandpit]], to be recaptured by the Soviets after Oxley accidentally brings them as assistance. On their way to Akator, Mac tells Jones he is a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] double-agent to regain Jones's trust, and Jones's team fights its way out of the Soviets' clutches, while Dovchenko is devoured by [[Dorylus|siafu ants]]. Jones and his allies cause many of the Soviets to fall from a cliff, and they survive three waterfalls in an [[GAZ 46|amphibious vehicle]]. Jones and Oxley identify a skull-like rock formation that leads them to Akator, unaware that Mac lied about being a CIA agent, is still loyal to Spalko and has been dropping transceivers to allow the surviving Soviets to track them.  The adventurers evade the city's guardians, gain access to the temple, and find it filled with artifacts from many [[Civilization|ancient civilizations]], identifying the aliens as extra-dimensional "[[Ancient astronauts|archaeologists]]" studying the different cultures of Earth. They find and enter a chamber containing the crystal skeletons of thirteen alien beings, one missing its skull. Spalko arrives and presents the skull to its skeleton, whereupon the aliens reanimate and telepathically offer a reward in ancient Mayan through Oxley. A [[Portals in fiction|portal]] to their dimension becomes activated, and the other remaining Soviets are drawn into the portal. As Jones, Marion, Mutt, and Oxley–who has regained his sanity–escape, the thirteen beings fuse into one, and in the process of receiving the overwhelming knowledge, Spalko is disintegrated and sucked into the portal. Mac is caught in the vortex while trying to scrounge some of the treasure, and even though Jones offers him his whip to pull him to safety, he willingly lets go and is sucked in. Jones and the others escape and watch as the city crumbles, revealing a [[flying saucer]] rising from under the ground and vanishing, while the hollow in the valley floor left by its departure is flooded by the waters of the Amazon.  The following year, Jones is reinstated at Marshall College and made an associate dean, and he and Marion are married. Before the wedding party leaves the chapel, a gust of wind blows Indy's brown fedora off the coat rack and deposits it at Mutt's feet. Mutt picks it up and is about to don it before Jones snatches it from his hands and puts it on with a grin.  
The Incredible Hulk (film)
  At Culver University in Virginia, General [[Thunderbolt Ross]] meets with Dr. [[Bruce Banner]], the colleague and boyfriend of his daughter [[Betty Ross|Betty]], regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans immune to [[gamma radiation]]. The experiment — part of a [[World War II]] era "super soldier" program that Ross hopes to recreate — fails, and the exposure to gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] for brief periods of time, whenever his heart rate rises above 200 beats per minute. The Hulk destroys the lab and injures or kills the people inside. Banner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross in particular, who wants to weaponize the Hulk in the process.  Five years later, Banner works at a bottling factory in [[Rocinha]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil, while searching for a cure for his condition. On the Internet, he collaborates with a colleague he knows only as "Mr. Blue", and to whom he is "Mr. Green". He is also learning [[Yoga]] techniques to help keep control, and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, and is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], giving him gamma sickness. Using the bottle to track down Banner, Ross sends a special forces team, led by Russian-born British [[Royal Marine]] [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]], to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. After Ross explains how Banner became the Hulk, Blonsky agrees to be injected with a small amount of a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impair his judgment.  Banner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty, who is dating psychiatrist [[Doc Samson|Leonard Samson]]. Banner is attacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces, tipped off by the suspicious Samson, causing him to again transform into the Hulk. The ensuing battle outside the university proves to be futile for Ross' forces and they eventually retreat, though Blonsky, whose sanity is starting to falter, boldly attacks and mocks the Hulk. The Hulk seemingly kills Blonsky and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue is actually cellular biologist Dr. [[Leader (comics)|Samuel Sterns]], who tells Banner he has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation. Sterns reveals he has [[organic synthesis|synthesized]] Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, with the intention of applying its "limitless potential" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply.  Meanwhile, Blonsky is revealed to have survived the earlier battle at Culver University and has completely healed. He joins Ross' forces for a third attempt to take Banner into custody. They succeed and Banner, along with Betty, are taken away in a helicopter. Blonsky stays behind and orders Sterns to inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power. Sterns warns that the combination of the super-soldier formula and Banner's blood may cause him to become an "abomination", but Blonsky insists. The experiment mutates Blonsky into a creature with size and strength surpassing that of the Hulk, but drives him insane. He attacks Sterns, who gets some of Banner's blood in a cut on his forehead, causing him to begin mutating as well. Blonsky then rampages through [[Harlem]]. Realizing that the Hulk is the only one who can stop Blonsky, Banner convinces Ross to release him. He jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a long and brutal battle through Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky. After having a small, peaceful moment with Betty, the Hulk flees from New York.  A month later, Banner is in [[Bella Coola, British Columbia]]. Instead of trying to suppress his transformation, he successfully transforms in a controlled manner. In a final scene, [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] approaches Ross at a local bar and informs him [[The Avengers (2012 film)|a team]] is being put together.

Both Jasper and Lenny's boss, Terrence Butcher ([[Matthew Macfadyen]]), who is in charge of the [[anti-terrorist]] division, try to comfort the mother; both are also romantically interested in her.  Through Jasper's investigation into the bombing, the mother discovers the identity of one of the terrorists. She befriends his teenage son (Usman Khokhar), who only knows that his father is missing since the attacks. When he finds out what his father did, he panics and runs, causing the police to suspect him to be a terrorist. When he tries to take something out of his pocket they think he has a gun or wants to trigger a bomb; they shoot at him, but he is unarmed. The mother, who tried to protect him, is wounded, but not severely. Later, the terrorist's wife and son apologize to the mother for his part in the killings.  Terrence confesses to the mother that he knew that a suicide attack was going to happen and could have stopped it, but he did not in order to be able to continue his investigation of the terrorist group.  He says that he did not know in which stadium it would happen, and also thought it would be of a smaller scale. Although he knew Lenny and his son would be going, he did not warn them.  Sometimes the mother is confused, thinking that nothing has happened to her son. Throughout the film, for therapeutic reasons, she writes a letter addressed to [[Osama bin Laden]], who is assumed to be responsible for the attack.  In the film's final scenes, the mother has another son by Jasper, who is seen running to the hospital and asking for her at the nursing station.

Inkheart (film)
 The film opens with [[Mortimer Folchart|Mortimer "Mo" Folchart]] ([[Brendan Fraser]]) and his wife Teresa "Resa" Folchart ([[Sienna Guillory]]) reading the [[fairy tale]] "[[Little Red Riding Hood]]" to their baby daughter [[Meggie Folchart|Meggie]], as a red velvet hood appears out of nowhere. Twelve years later, Meggie ([[Eliza Bennett]]) and her father visit an old book shop in Europe, unaware that Mo is secretly looking for a copy of the book ''Inkheart''. He succeeds in finding it. Shortly thereafter, Meggie encounters a [[marten]] with horns outside the shop, who tries to bite her fingers. A man ([[Paul Bettany]]) suddenly appears from the shadows, claiming to be an old friend. Mo comes out of the shop, recognizing the man as Dustfinger, who quickly asks him to read him back into the book. Mo flees with Meggie.  Mo takes Meggie to visit her great-aunt Elinor ([[Helen Mirren]]) in Italy. There he tells Meggie that nine years ago, reading to her from ''Inkheart'', he inadvertently freed Dustfinger, a fire dancer, due to a gift he possessed from birth. Unfortunately, the book's villain, Capricorn ([[Andy Serkis]]), and one of his henchmen, Basta, was also freed. Fleeing with his infant daughter, Mo lost Resa. Dustfinger and Capricorn's minion, [[Basta (Inkworld)|Basta]] ([[Jamie Foreman]]), arrive. Basta captures the group and takes ''Inkheart'', destroying Elinor's library. They are taken to Capricorn's new castle in the real world. During their imprisonment, Mo explains his gift to Meggie and Elinor, stating that when he reads a person or an object out of a book, someone from the real world is sent into it, hence his wife's disappearance. Capricorn forces Mo to use his gift, acquiring treasure from one of the stories in ''[[The Arabian Nights]]'', and imprisoning Farid ([[Rafi Gavron]]), one of the [[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves|40 Thieves]]. Dustfinger, who was promised a return into the book, is betrayed by Capricorn. Nevertheless, the group escapes using the [[tornado]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]''.  Meggie proposes to search for the author of ''Inkheart'', Fenoglio (named in honor of Italian writer [[Beppe Fenoglio]]), as he may have another copy. Elinor leaves to recover what is left of her library as the others head for the author's town, [[Alassio]]. Dustfinger is initially afraid of learning his fate in the book, but later joins them. When they meet Fenoglio ([[Jim Broadbent]]), the author's ecstatic mood upon seeing his creation alive makes Dustfinger realize he dies at the end, trying to save his marten, Gwin. Angry, he berates Fenoglio before eventually telling Mo that Resa is trapped in the castle and has lost her voice.  Mo and Dustfinger take Fenoglio's car; Farid stows away in the trunk. At Fenoglio's house, Meggie begins reading a number of books out loud, bringing [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] from ''The Wizard of Oz''. Basta bursts in with his men. Noticing Toto, he takes them to Capricorn. Elinor, who had decided not to take the train home, realizes something was amiss and pursues them. At the castle, Capricorn reveals he plans to bring the Shadow, the monster of ''Inkheart''. He threatens to harm Meggie's mother if she does not comply. Mo sneaks into the castle. Dustfinger is captured, but escapes after Meggie informs him of Capricorn's intentions.  Mo attempts to free Meggie and others, as Capricorn forces her to bring the Shadow. Dustfinger returns to the castle with Farid, setting it alight. The distraction allows Fenoglio to give Toto a rewrite he made to help Meggie stop Capricorn's plan. As Elinor arrives with the creatures Capricorn imprisoned, Meggie writes out the story on her arm. As she reads out her creation, Capricorn turns into dust, his henchmen and the Shadow vanish, and all the read-out creatures back are returned where they belong, including Toto. In addition, she grants Fenoglio's wish to live in the world he created, while reuniting her and Mo with her mother and restoring her voice. In the end, Dustfinger is also safely read back into ''Inkheart'', where he is reunited with his wife Roxanne. In the real world, Farid reveals he kept Gwin with him, thus allowing Dustfinger to avoid his fate and have control over his destiny. As Mo and his family leave with Farid, Meggie agrees to teach him how to read while Farid agrees to teach her how to use the dragon breath, the fire breathing ability of Dustfinger's which Farid learnt.  
Indiralohathil Na Azhagappan
 Azhagappan (Vadivelu) is a member of a theatre group. One fine day an unlikely visitor from the heavens stumbles upon him and almost falls for him. The beautiful trio of the heaven&nbsp;– [[Rambha (apsara)|Ramba]], [[Tilottama|Thilothama]], and [[Urvashi]]&nbsp;– comes to the earth to enjoy its “beauty”. While the others get back to where they belong to at the right time, Ramba (played by Yamini Sharma) loses her track and gets into trouble. Vadivelu accidentally helps her to go back to the heaven. She gets him to the heaven during the night and sends him back to the earth early in the morning.  Frequenting to the heaven and the hell gives Azhagappan an idea of what is happening in the other world. He is not serious about his rare opportunity to see the Lord Indra (king of all deities&nbsp;– played by Vadivelu) and the deities but the death of a neighboring child changes everything. He takes thing seriously and wants to teach a lesson to the deity of death ([[Yama|Yama Dharma Raja]]&nbsp;– played by Vadivelu again).  Vexed with the death and the ways human beings are treated with in the hell, Azhagappan decides to tamper with the process of life and death. He wants to tamper with the laws of the gods. The gods get angry and Azhagappan pays the price. Comedy turns into tragedy, as he is transformed into a 90-year-old whom even his mother (Sumithra) cannot recognize and Rambha is cursed to become a formless soul. Naradha (Nasser), as usual, makes amends to bring up the climax. Devendran seeks Brihaspathi's counsel and a way to relieve both Azhagappan and Rambha from their curses is born. How this happens even though Yama tries his best to stop it from happening forms the rest of the climax.  
The Informers (2008 film)
 In 1983, at an elegant [[Los Angeles]] party at a mansion, Bruce (Fernando Consagra) wanders away from the party and is killed by a speeding car. After the funeral, his friends Graham, Martin and Tim sit drinking with Raymond on a fancy hotel patio. Only Raymond is truly devastated and cries bitterly. The friends dismiss Raymond's tears. When Raymond leaves, Graham follows him.  Graham Sloan ([[Jon Foster]]) is the son of a rich, estranged couple and drives a [[Porsche]], stays in glamorous hotel rooms, and is a [[drug dealer]]. His father William ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]) is a [[movie producer]] with a pill-addled wife ([[Kim Basinger]]). William is having an [[affair]] with a local TV [[anchorwoman]], Cheryl Moore ([[Winona Ryder]]). His wife, meanwhile, is having sex with her son's friend Martin ([[Austin Nichols]]). Graham is aware that his girlfriend Christie ([[Amber Heard]]) is [[infidelity|cheating]] on him with a number of men, including his best friend Martin, a [[bisexual]] rock video producer. Since Graham and Martin are also sleeping together, Graham appears to be trying to accept the [[open relationship]].  A [[New wave music|new wave]] rock singer named Bryan Metro ([[Mel Raido]]) flies into L.A. He stumbles through his fancy hotel room and has sex with young [[groupie]]s. Getting out of the bath, he slips on the wet floor and slashes open his hand. He answers the phone, and he is berated by his manager for sleeping with [[underage]] groupies, and he mumbles that he needs a doctor. Later, he is taken to meet a movie producer who hopes to make a profitable [[B movie|B-movie]] starring the singer. The singer appears to be barely coherent, and his attention is only caught when he sees a young girl wearing [[Dental braces|braces]] watching TV in an adjoining room. Bryan staggers towards her and takes her into a bedroom. Later, he stumbles into a hotel room and finds a groupie in his bed. Slurring his words, he asks her to come closer, and he kisses her, and then punches her in the face.  Jack ([[Brad Renfro]]), a hotel [[doorman (profession)|doorman]] in Christie's place, has come to seek his fortune in L.A. as an actor. He is making a humble living working as a doorman and lives in a small, run-down house. He is alarmed when he gets a phone call from his grizzled uncle Peter ([[Mickey Rourke]]), a drifter ex-con who claims he needs a place to stay. Jack angrily refuses the request, because he wants to leave the  immoral, criminal side of his family background behind him. However, when Jack returns home, his uncle is waiting for him in a beaten-up van. To Jack's horror, his uncle is involved in a gangland [[kidnapping]]-for-hire plot, and the uncle has brought a kidnapped child to Jack's house. When a cleanly dressed, yet menacing [[gangster]] calls on Jack when the uncle is out, and asks to collect the "package", Jack feigns ignorance. When the uncle returns he tells Jack that the boy has to be killed, on the grounds that it will be more humane than what the gangsters will do to him, Jack offers to kill the boy. Instead of slitting the boy's throat, Jack pretends to kill the boy but actually releases him. Jack hides his failure to kill the boy by cutting open his hand and smearing blood on his hands and face, and he joins his uncle in the van and flees the scene.  Tim Price ([[Lou Taylor Pucci]]) is pressured to go with his father, Les ([[Chris Isaak]]), on a trip to Hawaii, ostensibly for the two to share father-son bonding time. They go to a bar, where Les starts a chat with two young women, who may be willing to have sex with them. However, Tim is not interested, and he is disgusted by his father's drunken, leering passes at the women. Tim does later find a girl he likes at the beach, but when the three of them have dinner together, Les begins to make passes at her and then both the father and the young woman make fun of Tim by suggesting that gay men were making passes at him on the beach. Tim leaves the dinner and goes out to be alone. When his father finds him, Tim refuses to talk, saying he has nothing to say.  Graham confronts Martin about Christie and asks Martin if he has been sleeping with her, apart from group sex. Martin denies betraying Graham and is shocked to realize that his friend has developed feelings for her; in their social scene, most interactions are fleeting couplings based on desire, not relationships based on caring. Graham then tells Martin that he feels adrift in his life, as if he does not have anyone who can tell him what is right or wrong. His whole life has become a series of casual encounters and light banter, which is covered over by a pharmaceutical haze. Graham seems to be making the first steps to moving away from his alienated, [[narcissist]]ic lifestyle. When one of Martin's lovers calls Graham to tell him that Christie has become ill and is lying out on the sand, he drives over to the house to see her. Even though he sees that she has developed [[lesion]]s, presumably [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS-associated]] [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], all over her dying body, he seems unable to take care of her and take her to a hospital. Instead, he kisses her once, and leaves her lying on a towel on the beach dying, alone on an empty stretch of sand.

Iron Man (2008 film)
 Genius, billionaire, playboy and philanthropist [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], who has inherited the defense contractor [[Stark Industries]] from [[Howard Stark|his father]], is in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war-torn Afghanistan]] with his friend and [[Civil-Military Co-operation#Doctrine|military liaison]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] to demonstrate the new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by one of his own company's rocket-propelled grenades, used by the attackers. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings; [[Ho Yinsen|Yinsen]], a fellow captive who is a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader [[Raza (Marvel Comics)|Raza]] offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but Tony and Yinsen know that Raza will not keep his word.  Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a prototypical [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|suit of powered armor]] to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden almost to completion, the Ten Rings discover their hostages' intentions and attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit in the process. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor for his chest. Personal assistant [[Pepper Potts]] places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, Stark keeps his work to himself because he is suspicious of his company.  At a charity event held by Stark Industries, reporter [[Christine Everhart]] informs Stark that his company's weapons, including the Jericho, were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark then learns that Stane has been [[arms trafficking]] to criminals worldwide, and is staging a [[Coup d'état|coup]] to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is shot at by two [[F-22 Raptor]] fighter jets. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who subdues Raza and has the rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive new suit [[reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Potts to hack into its database. She discovers that Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged. Potts meets with Agent [[Phil Coulson]] of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], an [[intelligence agency]], to inform him of Stane's activities.  Stane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane, but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, and Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark defies suggestions from S.H.I.E.L.D. and publicly admits to being the superhero the press has dubbed "Iron Man".  In a [[post-credits scene]], S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Nick Fury]] visits Stark at home, telling him that Iron Man is not "the only superhero in the world", and explaining that he wants to discuss the "[[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] Initiative".  
Ip Man (film)
 In the 1930s, [[Foshan]] is a hub of [[Nanquan|Southern Chinese martial arts]], where various schools actively recruit disciples and compete against each other. Although the [[Wing Chun]] master Ip Man is the most skilled martial artist in Foshan, he is unassuming and maintains an almost invisible profile. As an independent wealthy man, he feels no need to accept any disciples and instead spends his days training, meeting with friends, and spending time with his family. However, his wife is often resentful of the time he spends training and discussing martial arts with friends and colleagues. Though not a professional martial artist, Ip is respected in Foshan due to the abilities he displays in friendly, closed-door competitions with local masters. Ip's reputation is further enhanced when he defeats an aggressive, rude, highly skilled [[Northern Chinese martial arts#Northern styles|Northern Chinese martial arts]] master, Jin Shanzhao, thus upholding the regional pride of fellow Southern stylists and others in Foshan.  The [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]] in 1937 adversely affects the life of everyone in Foshan. Ip's house is claimed by the Japanese army and used as their Foshan military headquarters. Ip and his family lose their wealth and are forced to move into a decrepit apartment. Desperate to support his family, Ip finds work at a coal mine. The Japanese General Miura, who is a [[Karate]] master, establishes an arena where Chinese martial artists compete with his military trainees. Li Zhao, a former police officer  and Ip's acquaintance, is now working as a translator for the Japanese army. He  offers the martial artists working at the coal mine the chance to earn a bag of rice for every match they win. Ip at first declines to participate in the matches. However, when his friend Lin takes part in a match and does not return, Ip agrees to fight so he can find his friend. Ip watches fellow Foshan martial arts master Liu defeat one karateka, but then insist on fighting three and lose. When Liu attempts to collect the winning bag of rice from the first match, Miura's aide Colonel Sato shoots and kills him.  Ip figures out that Lin was beaten and killed by the Japanese  after an earlier fight. Barely able to contain his rage, Ip demands a match with ten karateka at once. Despite having not practiced Wing Chun since the Japanese occupied Foshan (to conserve energy and thus food for his family), he mercilessly defeats all of them with a brutal and effective barrage of blows, showing none of the restraint he exhibited in earlier matches. His skill arouses the interest of General Miura, who wants to learn more about Ip and watch him fight again.  Ip later visits his friend Chow Ching-chuen, who owns and runs a cotton mill in Foshan. Chow tells Ip that a bandit gang led by Jin Shanzhao is harassing his workers and trying to extort money from them. Ip finally consents to teach others, and trains the workers in Wing Chun for self-defense.  When Ip refuses to return to the arena, Miura grows impatient and sends the sadistic Colonel Sato along with several soldiers to find him. Sato sees Ip's wife and moves towards her. Ip defends his wife and incapacitates the three soldiers. They flee their apartment and take a room with Li Zhao's family. When the bandits return to the cotton mill, the workers fight back using the techniques that Ip taught them. Ip himself arrives midway through the battle. He defeats many of the robbers and personally beats Jin Shanzhao, embarrassing him, and warns him never to harass the workers again.  The Japanese soldiers eventually find Ip at the cotton mill. Ip tells Chow to take his wife and son away for protection. Miura tells Ip that his life will be spared if he agrees to instruct the Japanese soldiers in martial arts. Ip refuses and challenges Miura to a match, which Miura accepts, both because of his love for martial arts and because refusing the challenge would be a humiliation to the Japanese. The match between Ip and Miura is held in public in Foshan's square. Sato tells Ip that his life will be spared if he lets the general win. At first, the two fighters seem equally matched, but Ip's impeccable defense, relentless and direct blows allow him to eventually overwhelm Miura, inflicting a severe beating on him.  Ip is cheered by the Chinese crowd and sees his wife and child returning with Chow. Enraged at the general's defeat, Sato shoots Ip in the shoulder, igniting the Chinese crowd who overwhelm the Japanese soldiers. During the scuffle, Li Zhao kills Sato with Sato's [[Nambu pistol|own gun]]. Ip is taken away amidst the chaos. The epilogue reveals that he survived and escaped with his family to [[Hong Kong]] with the help of Chow Ching-chuen. There, Ip establishes a Wing Chun school, where his students come to learn martial arts from him, including [[Bruce Lee]].

Iran (is not the problem)

It also presents a view countering the international perspective that Iran’s nuclear proliferation is aimed at destroying [[Israel]], contrary to fact of the US domination of the world and its diplomatic  double speak. It also appraises the democratic movement within Iran, attributes reasons for the conflicts with the USA and Israel, and offers some solutions. Many opinions are screened which express their individual views.<ref name=TDF/>  
It Might Get Loud
 The film documents the varied playing and recording styles of guitarists [[Jimmy Page]], [[The Edge]], and [[Jack White]].  Page's history with guitar traces back to his childhood when he played in a [[skiffle]] band. After desiring to do more than play pop music, Page "retires" from guitar playing to attend art school. He later revives his music career as a session guitarist, only to be discouraged by the realization that he is playing others' music and stifling his own creativity. At that point, Page begins to write and perform in the bands [[The Yardbirds]] and [[Led Zeppelin]]. Page discusses the skiffle and [[blues]] music that influenced him at the time. For many of Page's scenes, he is seen visiting [[Headley Grange]], where several songs from ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' were recorded, and in one scene, explains how the distinctive drum sound from "[[When the Levee Breaks#Led Zeppelin's version|When the Levee Breaks]]" was achieved from the acoustics of the house in which it was recorded.  The Edge's history with guitar traces back to building a guitar with his brother [[Dik Evans|Dik]] and learning to play. In the film, he visits [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] and recalls forming [[U2]] in his childhood. He also demonstrates his playing technique, in how he eliminates certain strings from chords, as well as his use of echo and [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]] effects to "fill in notes that aren't there". He also discusses his purchase of his signature guitar, the [[Gibson Explorer]], in [[New York City]] and the [[punk music]] that influenced him. In other scenes, he plays early demo tapes of "[[Where the Streets Have No Name]]", discusses his inspiration for "[[Sunday Bloody Sunday]]", and spends time experimenting with guitar effects for the riffs to "[[Get on Your Boots]]".  Jack White traces his musical background to his childhood in a rundown neighborhood of [[Detroit]]. Living with two drum sets and a guitar occupying his room and sleeping on a piece of foam due to taking out his bed for more room for his music, White struggled to find a musical identity, as it was "uncool" to play an instrument and his nine siblings all shared a musical propensity. His strong interest in blues and [[Traditional music|roots music]] opposed the [[hip hop]] and [[house music]] popular in the predominantly Latino south Detroit neighbourhood at the time. White eventually finds a niche in a [[garage rock]] band called [[The Upholsterers]] while working as an [[upholsterer]], which paves the way for his future bands [[The White Stripes]] and [[The Raconteurs]]. White's philosophy is to limit and challenge himself in various ways to force creative approaches to recording and playing.  The touchstone of the film is a meeting of the three guitarists dubbed "The Summit". In these scenes, the three guitarists not only converse about their influences and techniques, but they also play each other's songs together, showing each other how to play "[[I Will Follow]]", "[[Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground]]", and "[[In My Time of Dying#Led Zeppelin version|In My Time of Dying]]".

JCVD (film)
 The film establishes Jean-Claude Van Damme playing himself as an out-of-luck actor. He is out of money; his agent cannot find him a decent production; and the judge in a custody battle is inclined to give custody of his daughter over to his ex-wife. His own daughter rejects him as a father, much to his chagrin. He returns to his childhood home of Schaarbeek in the Brussels capital region, Belgium, where he is still considered a national icon.  After posing for pictures with clerks outside a video store, Van Damme goes into the post office across the street. A shot is fired inside the post office, and a police officer responds but is waved off by Van Damme at the window, which is then blocked. He calls for backup.  The narrative then shifts to Van Damme's point of view. He goes into the post office to receive a badly needed [[wire transfer]] but finds that the bank is being robbed. He is taken [[hostage]] along with the others. The police mistakenly identify Van Damme as the robber when he is forced to move a cabinet to block the window. Van Damme finds himself acting as a hero to protect the hostages by engaging with the robbers about his career, as well as both a negotiator and presumed perpetrator. While speaking by phone as the ringleader of the robbers, Van Damme even goes so far as to demand $465,000 for the law firm handling his custody case. It is not clear if Van Damme demands the $465,000 out of self-interest or out of a desire to appear as a genuine bank-robber to the police as he insists to the thieves or perhaps both.  The narrative continues to shift to show Van Damme's troubles getting roles and money, and the media circus that develops around the post office and video store, which the police use as a base of operations.  In a notable scene, Van Damme and the camera are lifted above the set, and he performs a six-minute single-take monologue, where he breaks the [[fourth wall]] addressing the audience directly with an emotional (but characteristically cryptic) monologue about his career, his multiple marriages, and his drug abuse.  Van Damme then persuades one of the bank robbers to release the hostages. After this happens, a scuffle ensues and in the resulting conflict, the head robber is shot. The police, after hearing a gunshot, storm the building. The police shoot another one of the thieves, and Van Damme is held at [[Coercion#Physical|gunpoint]] by the final one. Van Damme briefly imagines a scenario in which he takes down the robber with an action-movie style kick, whereupon everyone including the police and crowd cheer for him, but in reality, he just elbows him in the stomach and the police take him into custody.  Van Damme is arrested for [[extortion]] over the $465,000 and sentenced to 1 year in prison. The final scenes show him teaching [[martial arts]] to other inmates, then being visited by his mother and daughter.

Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008 theatrical film)
 Max Anderson (Jean-Michel Paré) is being pursued by a ''[[Giganotosaurus]]'' when he finds a [[fissure vent]]. When he tries to jump across, he falls while calling out his brother's name. Ten years later, Max's 13-year-old son, Sean Anderson ([[Josh Hutcherson]]), visit Max's brother, [[volcanology|volcanologist]] Trevor Anderson ([[Brendan Fraser]]). In a box of items that belonged to Max is a book, ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' by [[Jules Verne]]. Notes written by Max are found inside the book.  In Trevor's volcanology laboratory, a device shows activity on [[Snæfellsjökull|Snæfell]], a dormant volcano in Iceland. Trevor and Sean travel to [[Iceland]] to investigate. They try to contact Icelandic volcanologist Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson, but instead encounter his daughter Hannah Ásgeirsson ([[Anita Briem]]) since her father had died some years earlier.<ref>In Iceland Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson's daughter would have the last name Sigurbjörnsdóttir, but in the film it is Ásgeirsson.</ref> It turns out that Sigurbjörn and Max were both Vernians, a group of people who believe the works of Jules Verne to be fact and not fiction.  Hannah offers to help them climb the volcano. While the group is hiking up the volcano, a [[lightning storm]] forces them to take shelter in a [[cave]]. The cave entrance collapses, trapping them in what appears to be an abandoned mine. The trio then rides on out-of-control [[minecart|mine carts]], in which the tracks start to branch off in three ways. Hannah and Trevor save each other from dead-ends and Sean reunites with them. They reach the bottom of a volcanic vent, but the floor of the vent breaks, and they begin to fall towards the center of the Earth. The vent eventually becomes a water slide which drops them safely into a lake in the center of the Earth, which turns out to be a completely separate world contained within the Earth.  The group starts seeking a way back to the surface. Along the way, they find evidence that someone had been there a hundred years ago. Trevor remarks that some instruments found are Lidenbrock's (the name of a character in the book), suggesting that another group had previously made the journey, somehow returned to the surface and recounted the tale of their adventure to Verne. They find some of Max's things as well. While Trevor and Sean are examining what they've found, Hannah finds Max's body. They bury Max on the beach of the underground ocean and Trevor reads a letter to Sean found in Max's journal. Trevor discovers that his brother died due to [[dehydration]] because of hot [[magma]] surrounding the center of the Earth.  Using information from Max's journal, Trevor determines that they must find a [[geyser]] that can send them to the surface before the temperature rises to 200 [[Fahrenheit|°F]] (about 93 [[Celsius|°C]]). Further, they must reach the geyser within 48 hours or the water for the geyser will have evaporated. They build a raft and begin crossing the underground ocean, but soon encounter a pack of ''[[Xiphactinus]]''. They use makeshift clubs to bat them away, then a shoal of ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' attacks the Xiphactinus, allowing the trio to escape. The raft's sail becomes loose. Sean tries to hold on, but is blown away and separated from the two adults.  A little bird guides Sean towards the river. Meanwhile, Trevor and Hannah decide to take a rest, but are attacked by carnivorous plants. Hannah is captured and starts being strangled by the plants. Trevor defeats the plant that is holding Hannah by the neck, and they continue towards the geyser.  When they arrive at the river, Trevor calls out to Sean but gets no response. Trevor says he is going to look for Sean, but tells Hannah she should continue on to the geyser and save herself. Before he goes, Hannah kisses Trevor in case he does not return. Meanwhile, Sean has entered an arid, bone-filled land. He hears roars, looks up and sees a 80-foot  ''[[Giganotosaurus]]'' coming after him. Trevor saves him, and the dinosaur falls through the fragile floor while trying to catch them. When they get to a river, they find Hannah sailing a boat fashioned from a ''Tyrannosaurus'' skull. They sail to a volcano with magma rising in its crater, but they are too late; the water needed for the geyser has evaporated.  Sean notices that the crater walls are wet. Trevor hears water flowing on the other side of the walls and sees that the crater walls contain [[magnesium]]. After he uses a [[pyrotechnic|flare]] to ignite the magnesium, the resulting water-magma collision triggers the geyser, shooting them up and out of the center of the Earth through [[Mount Vesuvius]]. When they fall, they accidentally destroy some of the vines in a [[vineyard]]. To make amends with the vineyard's [[farmer]], Sean gives the owner a diamond that he found while in the center of the Earth. Trevor sees that Sean has many more diamonds in his backpack.  After the adventure, Sean visits Trevor and Hannah in their new home, purchased using some of the diamonds Sean took from the cave; Trevor is also using them to fund his late brother's laboratory. Trevor hands Sean a book about another strange land, ''[[Atlantis: The Antediluvian World]]'' by [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]], and suggests they get together during Sean's Christmas break. Sean reveals that he has brought the little bird back from the center of the Earth to keep as a pet. However, the bird happily flies away, possibly reproducing his extinct species.  
The Judge and the General
 ''The Judge and the General'' tells a story of personal transformation, as a Chilean judge descends into what he calls the "abyss" of investigating crimes committed by Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship during the 1970s and 1980s in Chile.  Appeals Court Judge Juan Guzmán opposed the democratically elected [[Salvador Allende]] and supported General Pinochet until being assigned in 1998—by judicial lottery—the first criminal cases against him.  (Judges in Chile investigate, prosecute, and try cases.)  Filmmakers [[Elizabeth Farnsworth]] and Patricio Lanfranco follow Guzmán's investigations as he solves cases of murder and kidnapping and considers whether to indict Pinochet.  Viewers watch as Guzmán confronts his past collusion with the military government and faces his own doubts about whether Pinochet should be indicted or not.  The documentary begins with Judge Guzmán’s expressions of anguish, as he watches supporters of Pinochet taunt opponents during the general’s funeral in Santiago in December 2006.  The taunts – which laud the killings of the Pinochet years—take Guzmán back to the hatred and chaos of the Allende period, the 1973 Pinochet coup, and ensuing terror. The film flashes back briefly to those years, as Guzmán and others recall that time.  The film then follows two investigations which take viewers deeply into the story.  Manuel Donoso was a young sociology professor killed just after the coup. The documentary cuts back and forth between a disinterment of Donoso’s remains and his wife’s story, as she recounts his arrest, torture and death. The case widens out as the documentary moves between past and present, and other characters place the crime in context.  The other key case features Cecilia (Chechi) Castro, whose mother, Edita, faced a ghastly “Sophie’s Choice.” She led Pinochet’s secret police to her daughter’s hiding place in order to save a granddaughter’s life. Judge Guzmán and detectives investigate this case from, among other locations, a boat off the Chilean coast, where underwater cameras capture the shocking images of divers bringing up rails that had been tied to bodies of political prisoners thrown into the sea.  Guzmán is, perhaps, “the good German,” a citizen blind to the crimes around him until chance forces him into an investigation he never sought and didn’t want. As a young man  he had served briefly as a clerk in the Court of Appeals during the worst years of repression under Pinochet.  Judges of that court had to decide on thousands of habeas corpus petitions filed on behalf of victims, many of whom had disappeared into secret detention centers. Nearly all the petitions were denied, and Juan Guzmán wrote some of those denials. Had they been granted, many lives would have been saved. Viewers watch as he struggles with this memory and describes how his investigation made him realize how “blind” he had been. “ I would say it opened the eyes of my soul,” he says.  Guzman’s colleagues–-attorneys and judges—had doubted Guzman’s competence and his willingness to pursue Pinochet. By the end of the film, viewers will know whether they were right or wrong.  
Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead
  The film begins at a [[truck stop]] in an unspecified rural location. It is night time in the midst of a heavy rainstorm, and a [[prostitute|hooker]] gets into a large, black [[Peterbilt]] and offers her "services" to the trucker inside. The trucker is revealed to be Rusty Nail, when he recites his phrase "I like the rain. Keeps everybody inside and washes everything clean". He asks the hooker to go out into the rain to [[wetlook|get wet]]. When she is unnerved by this strange behavior and states she is leaving, Rusty Nail locks the doors and tells her to leave through the open window. He then shuts the window halfway as she is clambering out, trapping her with half her body hanging outside the truck. Rusty Nail then drives off, decapitating the hooker as he drives alongside a trailer attached to a truck.  Meanwhile, Melissa Scott and her fiancé Bobby Lawrence, a young engaged couple in their early twenties, are on a cross country road trip in a [[Chevrolet Caprice|1983 Chevrolet Caprice]] Wagon. They are heading across the [[Southwestern United States]] to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], where they plan on getting married. Joining them for the ride is Melissa's sister Kayla, who along the way picks up her online boyfriend Nick "Nik" Parker, a [[punk subculture|punk]].  When their car breaks down in the desert, the four find a seemingly abandoned house along a side road. In the barn, they find a silver 1971 [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] in working order with a full tank of gas. Melissa and Bobby are initially reluctant to take the car, as it amounts to thieving, but due to Kayla and Nik's persistence, they relent. However, Melissa leaves a note in the house with her contact details for whomever may own the house and/or car.  The next day, Melissa receives a phone call from the person who owned the car they stole. He then calls Melissa "[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears|Goldilocks]]" (she is blonde), revealing that he can see her. He also tells her, "I believe you have something of mine, 'cause I now have something of yours," soon after Bobby disappears from a diner restroom. The others find a [[CB radio]] in their car, with which Rusty Nail talks to them. He orders them to destroy their [[cellphone]]s and follow his orders if Bobby is to survive, and he has some quite nasty [[psychological]] [[mind game]]s that create a bridge for [[Splatter film|gory]], life-and-death situations. The group continues to follow Rusty Nail, who promises them that they will be ''all reunited'' soon, after Rusty requests for Kayla's middle finger, a reference to when Kayla flipped off the driver of a truck who turned out to be Rusty. The group heads to a [[Morgue|mortuary hospital]], then Kayla cuts a finger from a corpse and reach the wrong trucker because Rusty already knew that they had broken the rules. Rusty cuts one finger off Bobby and puts it in the [[glove compartment]] of the vehicle, which is eventually discovered by the group.  Rusty later instructs Melissa to "[[Striptease|strip]] down to her underwear" in front of his truck; it turns out not to be him, but some other trucker named Kenny Chesney whom Rusty Nail had instructed to be there. Rusty Nail soon pulls up at a bar in Utah, and Bobby tries to escape. He gains the attention of the barman, who has gone outside to smoke, but Rusty Nail catches him and uses a chainsaw-chain to cut off the barman's jaw. He then commands Nik to walk through a party dressed as a female and to buy crystal meth. Nik refuses to do this, and Melissa takes a knife to his throat, whereupon Nik cries, confessing that he is scared and his tattoos are fake. Nik walks up to the party in the clothes that were seen on the hooker earlier, only for Rusty to kidnap Nik and drive off. Melissa and Kayla chase them, and in the ensuing car chase, Rusty manages to ram his car, which is stolen by them, several times, overturning it with his truck. Kayla's leg is pinned, and she is killed when Rusty backs up and charges for them as he rams again, causing his car, which is mainly stolen by her, to explode as she flipped him off again as Melissa gets out of the car to save her own life, going without her.  Rusty takes Bobby and Nik back to his home and has them play a sadistic game of "[[Craps]]" with dice. In this game, whatever one person rolls makes the other person suffer. Bobby's kneecap is struck by a hammer and his nipple branded by the letter R. Once Bobby rolls a double one [[snake eyes]], Rusty kills Nik by stabbing him with a steel bar through the top of his head. Melissa breaks into a police station and steals a motor bike, racing off to find Bobby. Rusty Nail hangs Bobby by his neck in the back of his truck. Melissa parks the police motorcycle by the side of the truck, distracting Rusty and allowing her to overpower the killer with a few well-placed hits to the back with a shovel. She drives away in his truck, accidentally disconnecting the cabin from the rest of the truck and leaving Bobby behind, but Rusty manages to grab on to the side of the truck and climb on the roof. Melissa drives until the sun comes up and ends up plowing into a gas tank, causing the truck to catch fire. Melissa jumps from the truck as Rusty takes control, but it's too late, and he drives off the side of a cliff, the truck exploding on impact. Bobby escapes from the trailer and meets back up with Melissa, their ordeal finally over.  Later, in the middle of nowhere. A girl is stuck on the side of the road because her car has broken down. A big red Peterbilt truck with a trailer attached drives past her, only to stop and back up after she makes a nasty comment. She explains what's happened and asks for a ride. As the truck door opens, it is revealed that the driver has a badly burnt right arm. The girl climbs in and a familiar voice says "You'll catch your death out there," revealing that the driver is Rusty Nail, who survived the explosion. He drives away with the girl as the film cuts to black.

La Journée de la jupe
 Sonia Bergerac (Adjani), who favours wearing a [[skirt]], teaches French literature at a middle school in a poor immigrant-dominated neighborhood. She increasingly resents the daily burden of racist and sexist abuse from her violent [[apathy|unmotivated]] students, even more so since the [[divorce|departure]] of her husband. Her wearing of a skirt is considered sensitive given the school's large Muslim population, many of whom consider such clothing  immodest.  During the rehearsal of a [[play (theatre)|theatre play]] with one of her classes, she finds a gun in a student's bag. She struggles to grab the gun, and a shot is fired accidentally that injures the student's leg. Totally overwhelmed, she [[mental breakdown|loses control]] and takes her class hostage, opportunistically creating a proper — although biased — teaching environment.  While school, police and political authorities try to figure out what is going on and how to react, Sonia forces the students to see things her way and ultimately shows them the contradictions in their own lives. Most of them revolt against the macho bullies who abuse her and go over to her side.   When the police ask what conditions she sets for releasing the class, she asks that the government declare a Skirt Day in schools each year, when females can appear in skirts. She also asks for journalists who will publicise her case in the media. The police then get her father to speak to her and, when he switches to Arabic from French, the students realise that, like many of them, Sonia is also of North African origin.   When the journalists arrive, they are, in fact, policemen who fatally shoot her. At her funeral, the girl students all wear skirts.

One day, he is ambushed in his home by Roland Cox ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]), a member of the Paladins, a [[secret society]] of [[Religious fanaticism|religious fanatics]] who have been tracking down and killing "Jumpers".

Seeing Roland arriving, David decides to reveal the truth to her. He teleports her to Griffin's hideout. Using a machine that keeps David's "[[Wormhole|jump scar]]" open, the Paladins, including Roland, invade the hideout. David and Griffin subdue most of them. David sees his mother's photo on the wall and realizes she is also a Paladin. Roland is chased back through the jump scar, but he manages to snatch Millie with him. He sets up a trap in Millie's apartment, expecting David to come back for her.  Obsessed with killing Roland, Griffin plans to bomb the apartment, but David objects, wanting to save Millie. They fight and David traps Griffin with power lines in [[Chechnya]]. Ignoring Griffin's warning, David jumps to Millie's apartment and is quickly trapped by Roland's cables. The cables "link" him to the apartment, making him unable to jump away alone. Mustering his strength, David teleports the apartment and everyone inside to a river. Once free of the cables, David teleports Millie to safety and dumps Roland in a cave in [[Horseshoe Bend (Arizona)|Horseshoe Bend]]. He leaves Roland there, explaining that not all Jumpers are a threat to be destroyed.  David visits his mother and discovers his half-sister, Sophie ([[Kristen Stewart]]).

Faraday is captured by a dinosaur and both perish after Faraday sets off hand grenades. Hal and Ace shoot their way into The Centre's core but a hallucinogenic attack disorients them; a thick red fluid jams their weapons and almost suffocates them. Hal's ring relays instructions from the [[Guardians of the Universe]] on its use. Ace detonates his payload before Hal rescues him. The Flash races across the ocean, leaps onto The Centre's surface and covers it on foot. The Centre begins to shrink; Hal envelops the island in green energy, towing it into space where it explodes.

He had vowed once that he will only wed a woman wearing a silk saree, but had to settle for normalcy as he unable to garner enough savings to buy one.  But soon after, Venkatam's brother-in-law suffers losses in his business, and tells Venkatam that he will have to abandon Venkatam's sister because he wouldn't afford to take care of her.

He promotes the idea of equality to the silk weavers after learning about their poor pay and their inability to access the very product that they make. By time, Venkatam alongside fellow weavers embrace this idea and participate actively in [[street theatre]] mocking their [[Zamindar]], who employs all of them. After the writer is hunted down by police and killed (Communism was illegal at that time in [[India]]), Venkatam takes control, and under him, the weavers submit a petition demanding pay increase and other initiatives.  However, to his shock, his friend's son (with whom his daughter is in love with) returns from the [[armed forces]] one day, and informs that the [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British]] are defeating [[Germans]] in the war, meaning that relations with the Communists have deteriorated. At the same time, he also wants to marry Venkatam's daughter before he is asked to return to the battlefield, leaving Venkatam perplexed as he has to fulfill the promise of sending her off with a silk saree. With only half of the saree finished so far, he suddenly goes against his own words and asks all weavers to rejoin work immediately, and is branded a traitor.

He asks his sister to take her in, but his brother-in-law says it will hurt his dignity to have a thief's daughter stay in his house. Not knowing what to do, Venkatam poisons his own daughter and she dies shortly thereafter, ending her suffering.  As her dead body lay in front of the house, Venkatam opens up his house and finds the half-woven silk saree he had before. He takes the cloth and uses that silk to cover his dead daughter's body, in resemblance to what Venkatam said at the beginning of the film (at his father's death, Venkatam complained that despite his father being a silk weaver his whole life, he do not have a single silk cloth to cover his body, apart from a small piece tied at his toes as per tradition). He becomes mentally unstable (shown by his attempts at covering his daughter's face and leg with the half-woven silk saree).

Keroro Gunso the Super Movie 3: Keroro vs. Keroro Great Sky Duel
  Fuyuki Hinata and the [[Keroro Platoon]] are exploring an abandoned temple in the mountaintop city of Machu Picchu in Peru. While on the exploration, [[Keroro]] sets off many booby traps, and they find a hidden chamber with a large blue crystal in the center, on a stand that has a key in it. Keroro leans on the key, causing the room to activate a mysterious machine, this caused the entire temple to shake. The platoon run out of the room when they see this. While running, Keroro accidentally loses his Kero Ball and Fuyuki catches a fleeting glimpse of a glowing young woman as he is running out, and tells Keroro that there is a girl in the room, but he is forced to leave the room before he can say anything else. The group successfully escapes, while the girl (now sprouting a pair of glowing wings) watches them leave - while back in the chamber, something is growing within the crystal.  It moves on to the movie's official title sequence (making this the first Keroro movie to actually have one).  The story continues back in the Hinata household, where Natsumi, Koyuki and Fuyuki talk about Macchu Pichu. Natsumi almost drinks a mysterious bottle of fluid, when Keroro saves her at the last minute, as the bottled drink was actually a type of weapon drink called "Nanola", whatever the liquid touches turns into a terrifying weapon of destruction. Fuyuki then reminds Keroro that a new [[Gundam]] model has arrived at the toy store (possibly the Gundam Master Grade RX-78-2 Ver. 2.0), however, Natsumi told him that he still had chores to do. To cheer his friend up, Fuyuki said that he would buy the new Gundam for Keroro, overjoyed from Fuyuki's kindness, Keroro gives him his wallet to use for the Gundam.  Meanwhile, an unknown group was watching them. The leader was quite disturbed by Keroro's lack of leadership, and decided to relieve him of his duty of invading the planet. At the same time, Momoka called the Keroro Platoon over to have them answer for an unknown installation on her family's super computer. They stated that they weren't responsible, but then, a soldier reported an unknown object coming rapidly towards them.  After Fuyuki finishes buying Keroro's Gundam, everyone living in Tokyo witness an enormous ship appearing out of the sky. The Platoon runs outside the Momoka mansion to meet the invaders. The first is Shivava, a cocky Keronian who says he is a Great Sage Surpassing Heaven, who makes Tamama envious. The second to appear is Doruru, the trainer of the first Keron Army that Giroro served with. The two invaders reveal that they aren't working for the Keron Army, but instead were working for another Keroro, this one darker than the original, Dark Keroro. He arrives in a darker version of the Keroro Movie Mecha to declare himself the new king of the world. He proceeds in telling the platoon of the current situation, his domination of the world in 2 minutes. During the first minute, he took control of all the economy and super computers on earth, he then proceeds to the market, the military, and so on, that made one minute complete. In the second minute, he sends greeting cards to all the world leaders, and immediately sends his Mini-Keroro robots across the globe, to land and send out hypnotic waves to brainwash all who reside in the area, including Natsumi and Koyuki.  However Fuyuki arrives, shocked after seeing everyone in town acting strangely. Dark Keroro was surprised, as Fuyuki seems immune to it but isn't worried, since he is planning on the Giant Keroro Statue, a weapon said to be the ultimate destroyer. Dark Keroro then jumps into his Dark Keroro Mech, then proceeds into attacking the group, as well as Fuyuki. After the onslaught, Dark Keroro and his followers leave for their ship, without knowing that Keroro is following them by hovership. Meanwhile, Mois, unaffected by the waves, arrives to help Fuyuki take care of the other platoon members, while those who ARE under the waves control are working on parts of the Giant Keroro Statue. Fuyuki then leaves to help Keroro by using another hovership while Mois helps the battle-damaged platoon members, Giroro wakes up in time to hear from Mois what has currently happened, then Dororo arrives to tell them what happened to their friends.  Fuyuki arrives atop the ship to see a wondrous view of the cities that lie on top; the hovership he was on broke down and was plummeting down, then he was saved from falling by an angel-like woman named Nasca, the same woman he saw in Machu Pichu. After Fuyuki and Nasca parted, Fuyuki found a passage inside the ship. Giroro and Dororo were trying to get through to Koyuki and Natsume, who were already under the control of the Mini Keroro's hypnotic waves, but nothing happened, Tamama wondered why they weren't under the wave's control, and Dororo said that it was because they were Keronian, and a Keronian weapon can't affect other Keronians. Mois said that neither her or Fuyuki were under the Mini Keroro's control, thus raising the question as to how that's possible.  Somewhere in Dark Keroro's ship, Keroro and Fuyuki reunited, only to be washed away by the tide of water that goes through the underground hall, Fuyuki and Keroro were then saved by Keroro's hovership, just in time for their friends to arrive and help. They were then ambushed by Shivava, and then afterwards, imprisoned in the ship's barrier by Miruru, the ship's system operator. Doruru arrives to blow the group out of the sky while Kululu is forced to deal with Miruru. Doruru succeeds in shooting them down, forcing Dororo to catch them all on his shuriken hoverboard - the resulting overload causes him to crash-land in what appears to be a colosseum.  When Fuyuki, Mois, and the Keroro Platoon regain consciousness, they find Koyuki and Natsumi preparing to fight each other, due to being under Dark Keroro's hypnotic weapon's control. Kululu then reports to the platoon that Dark Keroro is a clone of Keroro, grown from a sample of Keroro's DNA off the Kero Ball, enhanced by super carbon and educated in a different way then Keroro was. After the discovery, they witness Koyuki and Natsumi's mindless battle with each other, this forces Giroro and Dororo to fight their friends and try to save them. While the friends were fighting each other, the answer to why Fuyuki and Mois were immune to the hypnotic rays was revealed, Mois's wrist protector which keroro gave her and the wallet that Keroro gave Fuyuki to buy the newest Gundam, are Keronian items, thus giving the one in possession of the item complete immunity of the hypnosis weapon. Keroro and Fuyuki told Giroro and Dororo about the Keronian items, and told them to place one of their things on Natsumi and Koyuki. Giroro throws his trusty bandolier on Natsumi, while Dororo throws his ninja knife on Koyuki's shoulder pad: these items freed the two girls from the mind control.  The entire group makes a run for it (though Giroro has to be carried away as he is rendered helpless without his bandolier), but were cornered by Dark Keroro and his subordinates. Fuyuki takes a gamble on Dark Keroro's similarity to Keroro, and tries to distract him by throwing Keroro's new Gundam model into the air: the plan falls flat as Keroro himself runs after it. Shivava unwittingly blasts a hole in the ground of the colosseum; Keroro and the others made their escape through the hole, then evade the pursuing Shivava when Fuyuki triggers a convenient trapdoor beneath them.  The kids (Fuyuki, Natsumi, Koyuki and Mois) and the Keroro Platoon rest for the coming battle. Tamama and Giroro in the meantime were wondering if they could defeat Shivava and Doruru, then Mois and Natsumi gave them words of encouragement that gave them hope for their rematches with the two soldiers. At the same time, the everpresent mind-control problem is rectified when Giroro hands Natsumi his bowie knife and takes back his bandolier (and returns to full form as a result), while Dororo simply exchanges knives with Koyuki.  A few hours later, Kululu made an astonishing discovery, apparently, the Keronian weapon Kiruru, the same weapon that threatened the planet twice (it used people's negative emotions against them in [[Keroro Gunsō the Super Movie]], and then possessed Meru in [[Keroro Gunso the Super Movie 2: The Deep Sea Princess|Keroro Gunsō the Super Movie 2]]) was threatening the planet once again. As it turns out, Dark Keroro is actually the 3rd generation of Kiruru. The first Kiruru was created for enemy alienation, whereas the second was made for destruction, the third and final one was made for one thing, and one thing only, absolute rule.  While the team was planning on how to defeat the third Kiruru (Keroro actually resurrects his rather harebrained scheme from the 2nd movie, involving everyone dressing up as princesses), an army of bracelets attached themselves to each one of them, and with a bright light, they disappeared from each other's sight. The bracelets were revealed to be Dark Keroro's newest weapon, the "Super Anti-Barrier", the wearer can neither hear or see other persons wearing the bracelets. Dark Keroro then separates them, planning on them to lose hope and become lost and alone forever, however, Kuyuki and Dororo don't need to see each other, they have been through events like this before and could easily sense each other's presence. While separated from the others, Fuyuki met with Nasca once again, only to be brought to Dark Keroro's throne room.  In the meantime, the rest of the group were still trying to look for each other, when Giroro wished for a weapon, Natsumi thought of the same thing, as did the rest of them. Nasca was revealed to be Miruru all along in disguise. As Miruru left, Dark Keroro proceeded in inviting Fuyuki to join him as his soldier, but Fuyuki declined. Confused, Dark Keroro threatened Fuyuki to join because he demanded it, causing Fuyuki to state "If that's the only way you can get others to submit to you, then you are not a king!" This angers Dark Keroro even more, so he gives a direct order to Shivava and Doruru to find and kill Fuyuki's friends, but Shivava and Doruru declined the order as well, they even told him to shut up.  Meanwhile, still concentrating on the group's thought of a weapon, Keroro ran straight to his Gundam model in the colosseum, where everyone else came, they all still couldn't see each other, but it didn't matter to them, they knew that they were together, and in celebration of finding each other, they built the Gundam together, forming a complete Mobile Suit action figure. Keroro then proceeded in pouring some of the Nanola on the Gundam, changing it into a giant robot, just like the giant mechs in the Gundam franchise. At the same time, Kululu and Natsumi finished work on an entirely new weapon, the Mini Kululu, thousands built with the technology to negate the Mini Keroro's brainwashing waves, and restore the people of earth back to normal, and freeing Momoka and her military squad as well. Keroro pilots his new Gundam robot straight at where Dark Keroro is, at the same time, Miruru uses the ship's defenses to attack the Gundam, blasting whole pieces off of it, until Koyuki and Doruru destroyed the combat system within the ship, causing everything to break and go haywire. Keroro blasts into the ships main building and is told by Kululu that Fuyuki and Dark Keroro are on the above floor. Keroro points the Gundam's beam rifle up and shoots a hole in the ceiling (This scene is a reference to a scene of the final episode of [[Mobile Suit Gundam]] when [[Amuro Ray]] and [[Char Aznable]] were battling).    With the Gundam reduced to a mere Core Fighter (the Gundam's cockpit fitted with its own propulsion system, like a minijet), Keroro finally made it into the enemy's throne room. As Fuyuki was trying to get Keroro out of what was left of the Gundam, Dark Keroro tried to convince him that it was pointless to try to save him, however, their bond was too strong for Dark Keroro to understand, and Fuyuki pulled Keroro out of the ship. Just when they started to rejoice, Dark Keroro screamed and summoned his Dark Keroro Mech to destroy both Fuyuki and Keroro. Dark Keroro is now determined to kill Fuyuki, seeing this coming, Keroro places Fuyuki inside the Gundam cockpit, knowing that he should be safe. Dark Keroro then focuses on killing Keroro, but before he could land a punch, something came out of nowhere and punched HIM. It was Keroro's own mech, the original Keroro Mech, remote controlled by Natsumi to come straight to Keroro's aid. The two mechs fight each other, leaving Fuyuki concerned about Keroro and what would become of him, as the battle progressed further, Keroro seemed to have the upper hand, until Dark Keroro shot one of his mech's arms off, giving Dark Keroro the perfect opportunity to attack, when suddenly, Fuyuki came in the way of Dark Keroro's deadly attack by ramming the Dark Mech with the Core Fighter.  The Dark Mech crashed and Keroro claimed victory. Dark Keroro called Shivava and Doruru for back-up, but he was rejected again. Dark Keroro then fell into despair, he had no one to help him, and no weapon to use, Keroro wanted to negotiate a cease-fire, but Dark Keroro refused, knowing that no one would obey him, he then set off a switch that made the Super Anti-Barrier glow even brighter, when Fuyuki opened his eyes the first thing that he saw was gunfire, gunfire that came from Keroro's mech and destroyed the Dark Mech completely, he even blew Dark Keroro into pieces. Keroro was speaking like a deranged villain, he even said that he would kill Fuyuki, his friends, and destroy the entire planet; terrifying as it is, Fuyuki wasn't buying it, he knew Keroro wouldn't crave for blood, so Fuyuki uncovered the truth, that wasn't Keroro at all, it was an illusion. The fake Keroro dissolved into nothing as the real Keroro emerged, free of the illusion; the successful resistance to the Super Anti-barrier destroyed the bracelets that were attached to the others.  Dark Keroro couldn't believe that they overcame his Super Anti-barrier's illusion, Keroro and Fuyuki were convinced that Dark Keroro was as rotten as they come, and could never be forgiven. However, Dark Keroro had one more trick behind his sleeve, The Giant Keroro Statue. The Statue parts have gathered together and the group could only watch as it is pieced together piece by enormous piece. However, the ship itself is a piece to, the tipping causes everyone to fall off, including Keroro, Fuyuki tried to save him but it was too late. The others are rescued by Momoka, Kululu and Natsumi, and they witness the completion and raw power of the Keroro Statue. The kids and the platoon prepare for the final battle, as Giroro and Tamama are confronted by Shivava and Doruru, Koyuki and Dororo deal with the Statue's defences. Dark Keroro and Fuyuki view from the top of the Statue to witness the strength of Fuyuki's friends, Dark Keroro started losing it, he questions Keroro about the bond that he and Fuyuki have, and Keroro told him that there was nothing special, and then Fuyuki said "Caring for friends is something that's shared by all, including humans and invaders." Dark Keroro still couldn't understand, and then, an explosion from one of Momoka's military ships blew off a piece big enough to crush Dark Keroro, but before he could meet his end, Fuyuki and Keroro protected him by shielding him from certain death.  Back in the aerial battle above, Tamama is unable to gain any edge over Shivava, until he snaps into full psycho form and lets loose with all his dirtiest tricks - from farting into Shivava's face to ganging up with Momoka and clobbering him into submission; Giroro defends a battleworn Natsumi by charging at Doruru and risking a barrage from Doruru's own Dendrobium mecha, until Natsumi returns Giroro's bowie knife and he shoves it into Doruru's weapons, allowing Giroro to defeat him.  Dark Keroro finally started to understand Fuyuki and Keroro, and blamed himself for everything that happened, they told him that Kiruru is to blame, not him, so Dark Keroro decided to go alone and stop Kiruru, and then Miruru appeared, it turns out, Miruru is the key to seal away Kiruru, just like Mirara from the First Movie. Miruru warns Dark Keroro that if he does succeed in sealing Kiruru, then Dark Keroro himself will disappear, he didn't care, but Fuyuki did, before Dark Keroro continued, Fuyuki told him that they could be friends, hearing that made him happy enough to save Fuyuki's planet. Dark Keroro seals away Kiruru, and disappears, along with the Keroro Statue, everything fell apart, Fuyuki could only watch as a good friend lost his life for a small planet. The sun rises, and Fuyuki and Keroro stand in the rubble where the Giant Statue used to be, but to their amazement, Dark Keroro was alive and well (his normally red eyes now black, and with an afro to match), it seems that he didn't disappear because the part of him that was a king died, while the other, lived as a friend.

Kemper: The CoEd Killer
 In [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], the police department is under pressure to solve a series of murders which appear to be the work of two independent serial killers. To help with the cases, Detective Tom Harris turns to his best friend, [[Edmund Kemper|Edmund Kemper]], a genius, but borderline [[Autism spectrum|autistic]], house painter who lives with his [[child abuse|abusive]] mother, and who had previously helped Harris capture another criminal named [[John Linley Frazier]]. Together, Ed and Tom decipher a message sent by one of the killers, who they discover taking pictures at the latest crime scene while they are staking it out. During the ensuing confrontation, the delusional man, [[Herbert Mullin|Herbert McCormack]], opens fire on the two, but is shot to death by Tom. Upon returning home after the encounter with McCormack, Ed bludgeons his mother with a hammer, and kills a female hitchhiker he had taken captive, revealing that he is the second killer.  While inspecting the abandoned pool where the hitchhiker's body was dumped, Tom receives a call from Ed, who reveals his involvement in the girl's death. While rushing to the Kemper residence, Tom gets another call from Ed, who instructs him to go into the kitchen, where Tom discovers Mrs. Kemper's vocal cords in the garbage disposal, and her severed head pinned to the wall with several darts protruding from it. Ed is eventually traced to a motel, but manages to escape, wounding an officer in the process. This, coupled with his past association with Ed coming to light, results in Tom being suspended from the force by the mayor, though he is quickly placed back on duty when Ed abducts a woman named Brandi, and threatens to kill her and one other person a day if Tom is not rehired.   As the investigation continues (with Ed shooting his grandparents at a young age coming to light, and a number of his previous victims being found in his backyard) a weary Ed ultimately allows the police to trace him to an abandoned hospital, where the mutilated Brandi is rescued. When Tom finds him wandering the building, Ed tells him that he was born there, and that his mother viewed him as nothing more than a burden forced upon her, a toxin spawned from the poisoned seed of a man who did not even bother to stick around. After apologizing for everything he has done, Ed tries to commit [[suicide]], but is wounded by a sniper, and arrested. The film ends with Tom visiting Ed on [[death row]].

Then she leaves home and goes swimming in the sea to vent out. Far into the sea, she vanishes underwater.  She wakes up in the evening in a cottage which has no exit. At first she doesn't believe that she has been kidnapped and thinks that her friends are playing a prank on her. The abductor Kabir ([[Imran Khan (Bollywood actor)|Imran Khan]]) tells her how she came there. When she went swimming in the open sea, he pulled her below the water surface and knocked her unconscious using a bottled chloroform.  Meanwhile, everyone is worried at her home. Next morning, her mother receives a call from Kabir wherein he says that he is interested in speaking to Sonia's father, Vikrant Raina ([[Sanjay Dutt]]), a New York-based Indian business tycoon, with whom he has an old score to settle.  Vikrant Raina is introduced as a cruel and heartless but a very wealthy man, worth USD 51.7&nbsp;billion. He is in India because he believes someone has emptied a large share of his money. Mallika meets him and tells him that Sonia has been kidnapped and that the kidnapper wants to speak only to him.  Its around 3 p.m. when the kidnapper calls again. Vikrant and Sonia speak to each other for the first time in eight years. Kabir tells Vikrant that the money is safe in his account. Vikrant wants to know the reason behind the kidnapping. Kabir tells him that he has to do a few things as ransom to release his daughter. The very first of them is saying "Sorry" to Sister Margaret whom he would find on a train from Panvel at 4&nbsp;pm. Vikrant says its crazy to reach there in half an hour. But Kabir tells him that she has a clue of how they can meet. Vikrant is determined to reach the place by 4 p.m. and he has to overcome unwarranted circumstances. Sister Margaret hands over a piece of paper which has a poem written on it. Vikrant knows there is something in it so he involves a detective Irfan ([[Rahul Dev]]) who has solved many corporate kidnapping cases successfully in the past.  But Kabir is interested in playing a dangerous game with Vikrant. He is asked to perform daring tasks (like robbery from a business rival's house) which would reward him with a clue to identify the kidnapper and the motive of kidnapping. At the same time Kabir starts to lose control emotionally with Sonia but stays away from her.  On the other hand, it is hard to believe for Sonia that she has been kidnapped. Initially Kabir is good with her but when she tries to stab Kabir by pretending to flirt with him and stabs his leg. He becomes furious and tries to molest her but he remembers that this is not his aim and leaves her but he ties her up.  Once Sonia realises that Kabir is probably frustrated but not a bad human being she gets a little comfortable with him. She subsequently realises that she is being kept in a bungalow which was once owned by her father. On inquiring further Kabir reveals that several years earlier Vikrant had falsely accused Kabir of kidnapping Sonia. Consequently, Kabir spent his formative years in jail where he underwent undue mental and physical torture. Kabir was simply out to get even with Sonia's father (Vikrant) by kidnapping her for real.  Meanwhile, based on the clues he already has, Vikrant figures out that Kabir is his daughter's kidnapper. Meanwhile, unable to reach Vikrant over the phone Kabir decides to pay him a visit. As planned, Vikrant and Irfan intercept the kidnapper and a chase ensues. Eventually, Kabir leads Vikrant to Sonia. After meeting his daughter briefly, Vikrant is told to dismiss Irfan from the case and he hands Vikrant the task to free a prisoner from jail. Vikrant follows the command but during the assignment, Irfan intervenes and shoots Kabir.  An injured Kabir is nursed by Sonia when he reaches the bungalow. Despite having an opportunity, she does not escape, due to her experiencing [[Stockholm syndrome]].

On reaching his old bungalow he does not find his daughter or the kidnapper but instead discovers the next clue that requires Vikrant to murder someone at a New Year's Eve party. After much deliberation Vikrant commits the murder and realises that he murdered the kidnapper, Kabir. While Vikrant is guilty and pensive at the turn of events, Kabir emerges alive. Kabir makes him realise that Vikrant is a criminal himself even though he committed the crimes to rescue his daughter. Kabir then asks Vikrant to reflect on the past and decide for himself if Kabir was a criminal who deserved the jail time or a teenager who was unduly penalised for an innocent mistake. After, Vikrant apologises to Kabir, Kabir disappears and his jacket leads Vikrant to the final clue which leads him to his daughter.  In the final scene, the Raina family is reunited and enjoying at a gathering. At the gathering, Kabir pays a surprise visit to Sonia and apologises for the trouble he put her through.

Because of the situation with Blackbird and the mafia the Colsons are put in [[Witness Protection]] services.  Blackbird and Richie figure out the Colsons have gone to Missouri by tricking Carmen's mother into giving Richie their new phone number.

With the FBI thinking Blackbird is dead the Colsons no longer need protection and are allowed to return home. Before Blackbird and Richie leave Donna's house to kill the Colsons, Richie shoots Donna out of jealousy because she and Blackbird were getting along too well.

While they wait for Wayne to come home they sit at the dinner table while Blackbird eats.

As he runs back to his truck Blackbird bursts out the front door and starts shooting at him. Wayne manages to take cover behind his car and get his shotgun. They exchange fire for a bit before Blackbird hits Wayne with one of his shots. As Blackbird moves in for the killshot, he pauses and turns around to see Carmen pointing Richie's gun at him. Blackbird thinks it is empty because he took the bullets out of it so he doesn't react to the threat, forgetting the one bullet she spit out of her mouth earlier. While Blackbird is distracted by Carmen, Wayne crawls to his shotgun and he and Carmen shoot Blackbird dead at the same time. Wayne and Carmen hug each other outside their house as a pool of blood forms under Blackbird.

After Munna informed King's family that King disappeared, Appaji tried to escape, but he got picked up by Munna. Munna gave a picture of King's corpse, time, and day to Appaji. Appaji had nothing to do with King's murder. Once Bottu Seenu gets access to King's bank accounts, Appaji will be able to repay his debts because he borrowed much money from goons. Shravani and Gnaneshwar mistaken Bottu Seenu as Sharath again. They accompany Bottu Seenu to the palace. Swapna's none other than Chandu's daughter, but Chandu committed suicide because nobody believed that he didn't steal the money. Swapna and the mysterious shooter were hired by Bhagath Seth (Bharath Dhabolkar). The mysterious shooter's Baba. Swapna's real name's Pooja. Bhagath hires Pooja to kill Ajay. Ajay brings his girlfriend Pooja to his home. Suddenly, Bottu Seenu attacks Pooja, but a few seconds later, he has no idea what happened. Gnaneshwar believes that King's spirit came to get revenge and controlled Bottu Seenu. Bottu Seenu gets engaged to Shravani. Swapna knows that it's not King who's living in the palace right now. Bhagath hires a bunch of guys including Baba to dress up in black and kill King's imposter and Ajay in the palace during the night. Bhagath Seth thinks that he shouldn't trust girls including Swapna. Bottu Seenu's controlled by King's spirit and saves Ajay from Swapna. Another twist: Ajay met Swapna right before she killed King. She feels that Ajay depends on his brother too much so he told her to kill King. 3rd twist: BS/Sharath is revealed as King. He calms his bro down. Munna captures Baba. Baba reveals his motive for planning to kill Swapna too, and Swapna is Chandu's daughter. Swapna's told what really happened that day, but doesn't kill King. The father and friends who took care of BS were Munna's people. Munna's real name is Bottu Seenu. King says that Ajay's mistake's unforgivable. King's family members are feeling sad, so he decides to leave. He dies in an explosion which takes place in his car. King's mother leaves and doesn't want anyone to look for her. Everyone else is probably still mad at Ajay. The fourth twist is that King's still alive. He reveals his plan to Shravani only. King told Bhagat's henchman, who kidnapped Ajay at the beginning of the movie: "I want you to tell me Bhagat's evil plans." After King got shot, Munna took him to the hospital. Swapna's details were fake, so they couldn't find her. He decided to play this double role drama. Bhagat's henchman/King's informer reveals the shooter's working for Bhagat too but didn't find details about Swapna. When King met his evil uncles again, none of them had nothing to do with it. King realized that Ajay was behind everything. King's informer blew up King's car after he escaped. This was King's plan too. The informer put a bomb inside Bhagat's car too, so King talks to Bhagath on the phone before Bhagat dies. King pretends to be Sarath in front of everyone else.  The final twist: Bottu Seenu/Munna's father and friends were responsible for messing up lights and pulling table with rope in King's palace. They did it to make it look like King's spirit came for revenge.

There are eleven other boys working at the mill, and Krabat develops a friendship with one of them, a young man named Tonda ([[Daniel Brühl]]). Soon, Krabat learns that the apprentices are also taught dark sorcery by the master, and one of the rituals (during Easter) lead to an excursion to the nearby village Schwarzkollm where Krabat meets a young girl and falls in love with her. There, Tonda also talks to one of the girls; both seem to be in love with each other. Later, Tonda warns Krabat that the master must never know the name of his girl.     One day, while protecting the nearby village from soldiers, Tonda makes an error and his girl's name (Worschula) is revealed to the master. The next day, Worschula turns up in the creek, dead. Krabat mistakenly blames Lyschko, another apprentice. Tonda becomes a recluse and anticipates the end of the year. Krabat's first Silvester (New Year's Eve) brings to light the true horror of the mill. Every Silvester, one of the boys must be sacrificed so the master may remain young. And so at midnight, Krabat's best friend Tonda is viciously murdered, and when Krabat tries to help him he is stopped by the other boys who tell him that "there is nothing we can do".  Before he dies, Tonda tells Krabat there is another boy in the mill Krabat can confide in. He also tells Krabat to take two sacks of flour to the village.

He is in love, but does not let the girl tell him her name, fearing for her life. Instead, he calls her Kantorka (Choir leader). During the ritual at Easter night, he goes to the village to meet her, this time along with a boy called Juro who appears to be mentally disabled and not able to learn the trade or properly do magic. When Juro tells Krabat that they must leave and go back to the mill, Krabat insists that he will stay with Kantorka. Juro then uses powerful magic to convince Krabat to come back with him, revealing that he is in truth highly intelligent and powerful, even able to change the weather. Juro promises Krabat that he will help him escape the master, and tells him that his girl must ask for him on Silvester to set him free.  Krabat tells Kantorka that she must do so, and she agrees and gives Krabat a lock of her hair, telling him to have another boy deliver it to her when the time is right.

Kung Fu Panda
  In the Valley of Peace, a land in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] inhabited by [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals, a [[giant panda]] Po is a [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] fanatic who idolizes the Furious Five – [[tiger|Tigress]], [[Monkey]], [[Mantis]], [[snake|Viper]], and [[Crane (bird)|Crane]] – a quintet of kung fu students trained by the [[red panda]] Master Shifu. As he helps his adoptive goose<ref></ref> father Mr. Ping in his [[noodle]] restaurant, Po is unable to pursue his dream of becoming a kung fu master himself.  Grand Master Oogway, an old [[tortoise]] and Shifu's mentor, has a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]] that Shifu's former student, the evil [[snow leopard]] Tai Lung, will escape from [[prison]] and return to the Valley of Peace to take revenge for being denied the Dragon Scroll, which is said to hold the secret to limitless power. Shifu starts panicking and sends his messenger, Zeng the goose, with a request for the prison to heighten security in order to prevent Tai Lung's escape. He then holds a kung fu tournament for the Furious Five so that Oogway may identify the [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]] Warrior, the one kung fu master worthy of receiving the Dragon Scroll and capable of defeating Tai Lung. Po arrives as the arena doors close and is unable to enter. Desperate to see the Dragon Warrior chosen, Po straps himself to a set of fireworks, rockets into the sky, and crashes into the middle of the arena. He opens his eyes to see Oogway pointing his finger at him, and to the shock of everyone present (and Po's huge surprise), Oogway proclaims Po as the Dragon Warrior.  Unwilling to accept that Oogway's decision was intentional, Shifu tries to make Po quit through a torturous and agonizing training regime coupled with constant ridicule of his physique and personality. The Furious Five also recognize Po as simply a low-life kung fu enthusiast with no prerequisite or potential in the [[Martial arts|martial art]]. Instead of denouncing the Five and Shifu for the way they treat him, after receiving encouragement from Oogway, Po endures his training and slowly begins to befriend the Five with his tenacity, culinary skill, resilience, and good humor, though Tigress remains reluctant and hesitant to embrace him as the Dragon Warrior. Meanwhile, Tai Lung escapes from prison as foreseen by Oogway, ironically picking his locks with one of Zeng's fallen feathers. Shifu learns of Tai Lung's escape from Zeng and informs Oogway, who extracts a promise from Shifu to believe in Po, and then passes on to the heavens in a stream of peach blossoms. Still unable to grasp the basics of kung fu, Po despairingly admits that he has no chance of defeating Tai Lung. Shifu, however, discovers that Po is capable of impressive physical feats when motivated by food. Using this as [[positive reinforcement]], Shifu successfully trains Po to incorporate these feats into an effective kung fu style.  Meanwhile, the Furious Five set out to stop Tai Lung themselves. After encountering him, binding him to a bridge rope and throwing him over a gorge, they believe that he is vanquished, only to be overwhelmed and defeated by his [[pressure point|nerve strikes]]. Shifu decides that Po is ready to receive the Dragon Scroll, but the scroll reveals nothing but a blank reflective surface. Unable to understand the message of the scroll, Shifu orders Po and the Five to evacuate the valley while he holds off Tai Lung, accepting that this will most likely cost him his life. As Tai Lung arrives and fights Shifu, the distraught Po finds Mr. Ping who, in an attempt to console him, reveals that the long-withheld secret ingredient to his famous "secret ingredient soup" is "nothing", explaining that "to make something special you just have to believe it is". Po realizes that this is the message of the Dragon Scroll, and goes back to confront Tai Lung.  Po becomes a formidable challenge for Tai Lung, frustrating him with confusing fighting techniques on top of a physique that renders him immune to Tai Lung's nerve strikes. Tai Lung momentarily bests Po and retrieves the scroll, but is unable to understand or accept its symbolic meaning. Eventually, Po defeats Tai Lung in combat before using the mysterious [[Grappling hold|Wuxi Finger Hold]] to vanquish him. Po is praised by the Valley of Peace and earns the respect of the Furious Five, who fully acknowledge him as a true kung fu master. Po then finds Shifu, who finally attains inner peace with the valley safe once more.  
Kung Fu Dunk
 The film revolves around an orphaned boy called Fang Shi-jie ([[Jay Chou]]), who grew up in a [[kung fu]] school and becomes a talented [[basketball]] player.<ref name = "early-cast"></ref> Every morning, he is used as a punchbag in a demonstration by the principal of the school. When he uses shaolin iron vest (iron shirt) technique, as to not feel the principal's punches, the principal makes him stay on the streets for one night without dinner. He demonstrates his incredible accuracy to a down-and-out hustler, Wang Li by throwing cans into a bin almost ten metres away. Wang tells him, that if he can throw a coin into his mouth from twenty metres away, he would treat him to dinner. They go to a five-star French restaurant, where Wang Li's daughter works, and eat leftovers. Li convinces Shi-jie to help them make some money for themselves. After eating, they go to a Casino owned by one of Wang Li's old friend's son, Brother Hu. There, Shi-jie wins hundreds of dollars playing [[darts]]. The resulting fight causes thousands of dollars' worth of damage. The next morning, before school starts, Bi Tianhao, the principal of Fireball University puts the principal of the kung fu school onto his paylist. Then, after a massive beating by Bi Tianhao's thugs, Shi-jie is expelled. The next night, Shi-jie is once again sitting on the park bench where he met Wang Li, who is still there. On the pretext of helping him search for his family, Wang Li invites him to play basketball at 'First University' as the new star of its basketball team. Meanwhile, Wang Li capitalises on media interest in Shi-jie to make money via interviews and news articles.  After joining the basketball team, Shi-jie finds that Li-ji (Lily) ([[Charlene Choi]]) whom he had admired for a long time is the sister of Ting Wei (Bolin Chen), the leader of the basketball team. Shi-jie is desperate to draw her attention. Therefore, he attempts to compete with Xiao Lan ([[Baron Chen]]), who is Li-li's idol. The competition between Shi-jie and Xiao Lan generates an unstable atmosphere within the team. After Ting Wei counsels Shi Jie, the basketball team becomes more unified. Meanwhile, he helped Shi Jie combine his foundation of Kung-Fu skills into basketball techniques, which in turn brings his skills into full play and helps the team win many rounds of the inter-varsity tournament.  By the time of the finals, the major competitor faced by Shi-jie and his team members is the team of Fireball University, led by Li Tian. Li used to be on the First University basketball team alongside Ting Wei and Xiao Lan, but became arrogant and was lured to their competitor's camp. The competing team composed of players who had been banned from all basketball games in Japan. Fireball University also bribed the referee of the final game. Although Wang Li had enlisted the aid of Shi-jie's kung-fu teachers, the opposing team had put in place a number of measures to prevent First University from winning, up to and including injuring First University's star players Shi-jie, Ting Wei and Xiao Lan. Thus, due to both unscrupulous fouls from the opposing team and the referee's biased decisions and outright interference by punching out the last ball that Shi-jie throws, First University is defeated. Unwilling to admit defeat to such unjust conditions, Shi-jie recalls a technique his first teacher had utilised, and manages to turn back the clock to the time just before Shi-jie is to make his last throw of the game. Given a second chance and instead of trying to make the same last throw which will be interfered by the referee again, Shi-jie decides to pass to Ting Wei, who in turn dunks it past Li Tian into the basket. Eventually, First University wins.  After the game, Shi-jie discovered that his dad is the richest man in Asia. He later visits his father, and discovers that he was abandoned for his safety during a difficult financial time of his father's life. His dad insisted that he go to London to expand his future. Later that night, Shi-jie decided to stay with Wang Li instead, who later suggested for him to show his skills in an event greater than any basketball match - the [[Olympic Games]].  
Kuruvi
 Vetrivel alias Velu ([[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]]) is a car racer who lives with his large family in [[Chennai]]. His father, Singamuthu ([[Manivannan]]), had gone to [[Kadapa]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]] to work at a [[colliery]] and never returned, prompting Velu and his family to think that he is dead. Velu comes to know that a [[Malaysia]]-based [[crime boss|don]] named Koccha ([[Suman (actor)|Suman]]) owes his father a huge sum of money. Velu and his friend Ops ([[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]]) travel to Malaysia as ''Kuruvi'', the trade jargon for low-level contraband carriers. They come to Malaysia at a time when internal rivalry and problems are surfacing in Koccha's family. Koccha's younger sister Devi ([[Trisha Krishnan]]) has refused to marry Soori ([[Pawan (actor)|Pawan]]), the brother of Konda Reddy ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]), Koccha's Kadapa-based business associate, as per Koccha's wishes.  Irritated and preoccupied, neither Koccha nor his henchmen want to devote any time or attention to resolve Velu's problem. Velu is ill-treated and thrown out of Koccha's place without any help rendered. Determined to return to India only after his father's issue is solved to his satisfaction, Velu conceals himself in Koccha's palace-like residence. He soon finds out about a large diamond owned by Koccha and steals it, feeling that it would pay off his father's debt, and returns to India with Ops. Devi also follows Velu to India, having fallen in love with him, when he saves her from falling from a tall building during New Year's Eve.  Knowing that Velu has stolen his diamond, Koccha and his gang visit Velu's house and threaten his family with dire consequences unless Velu returns the diamond. After confronting Koccha, Velu comes to know that his father isn't dead, but is being held as bonded labour along with many innocent people at Kadapa. Singamuthu had discovered diamonds at the colliery, but refused to allow Koccha and Konda Reddy to illegally mine the diamonds for their own benefit. He had been held prisoner in Kadapa since.  Velu immediately leaves for Kadapa, where he encounters Koccha again. He throws him onto a moving train, paralysing him. He soon discovers a slave camp run by Koccha and Konda Reddy ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]) at the colliery, where a [[Promiscuity#Male promiscuity|womanising]] rowdy named Kadapa Raja ([[G. V. Sudhakar Naidu]]) is torturing the inmates, including Singamuthu. He single-handedly takes on Konda Reddy, Kadapa Raja and their henchmen, killing them all. He drags Konda Reddy's dead body to Koccha's mansion. Koccha, who now uses a wheelchair, sees the dead body of his associate and attempts to shoot Velu. He is arrested at that moment by a special task force led by Raj ([[Nassar]]). Singamuthu and the others who were imprisoned in the slave camp are finally freed and reunited with their families.

Kuselan
 Balakrishnan ([[Pasupathy]]) is the owner of a barber shop in a remote village. His family consists of his wife Sridevi ([[Meena Durairaj|Meena]]) and three children. Balakrishnan struggles to persuade customers to visit his barber shop while his competitor Shanmugham ([[Vadivelu]]), a former worker of Balakrishnan who has his own barber shop across from Balakrishnan's, uses cunning means to make business in haircutting. Balakrishnan's downfall in business causes him to neglect paying his children's school fees. Although he struggles to make a living, he still enjoys spending time with his family.  News spreads through the village by Nagaraj ([[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]]) that superstar Ashok Kumar ([[Rajinikanth]]), a popular film actor, will be arriving for a shooting schedule. While the rest of the village celebrates in shock and excitement, the news does not impress Balakrishnan, who was best friends with the actor during their childhood days. The two have not met one another for nearly 25 years. Balakrishnan is often bothered by Sridevi and his children to introduce them to Ashok Kumar. Kuppuswamy ([[Livingston (actor)|Livingston]]), a financier who is keen on making a film and who was once disgusted by Balakrishnan's barber shop, tries to woo him into introducing him to Ashok Kumar so that he can make a film with him. Meanwhile, Sridevi spends her time bragging to her neighbours about her husband being friends with the super star.  In the other part of town, Ashok Kumar is given tight security, led by the deputy commissioner Senthilnathan ([[Prabhu Ganesan]]) due to the possibility of misbehaviour among the crowd who spend their time hanging out in front of every shoot location, eager to get a glimpse of the superstar. Ashok Kumar is shown taking part in the filmings of ''Annamalai: Part 2'', ''Chandramukhi: Part 2'', (fictional sequels of ''[[Annamalai (film)|Annamalai]]'' and ''[[Chandramukhi]]'') and ''Kuselan'', along with his co-star Nayantara ([[Nayantara]]).

L for Love L for Lies
 Everything was going well for Kwong Mei-Bo ([[Stephy Tang]]) until recently. After graduating from college, Bo opened a sweets shop with her longtime boyfriend, Jun ([[Stephen Wong Ka Lok]]), thinking that she would eventually marry Jun when everything has been set up and running smoothly. One day, Bo met her old Taiwanese classmate Kei Kei ([[Alice Tzeng]]). Kei Kei liked Jun’s hard working and nice personality, and decided to steal Jun for her own, not caring about Bo's feelings. Bo not only lost the long time love of her life, but she also lost the sweet shop that she has worked so hard on.    Ah-Man ([[Leila Tong]]) is Bo's good friend on the phone. The pretty and attractive Man would often time have some short relationships with other men while concealing all this from her introverted and slow boyfriend, Fung ([[Terry Wu]]). Although Man loves Fung, she takes him for granted and thinks he will never leave her despite her selfishness. In the meantime, Fung is two-timing Man with another woman.  After the break-up, Bo found a job as a make-up artist in the mall. Her boss Kuen broke the news of her engagement and invited everyone out to celebrate. At the party, Bo realized that her boss’s really young fiancée looked very familiar. She recognized him as her old neighbor Keung ([[Alex Fong (singer)|Alex Fong]]), who had a crush on her before being admitted to teenage prison, but Keung keeps pretending that he doesn’t know Bo. A month later, Kuen’s wedding was suddenly canceled and Bo found out that her boss’s life savings were stolen from the fiancée, who disappeared. Bo unexpectedly met Keung on the streets, learning that he is a conman. Keung finds Bo following him and expects her to sue him, but Bo hires Keung to deceive Kei Kei and let her have a taste of her medicine.  One day, Keung met his ex-girlfriend, Yan ([[Linda Chung]]). Yan told Keung that her family will move to Singapore and that he should go visit them. Although Keung had deceived Yan's sister's money, they had forgiven him. In his drunk and self-loathing state, Keung kissed Bo for the second time as she tries to comfort him. As an experienced liar, Keung successfully courted Kei Kei. Being abandoned by Kei Kei, Jun decided to make up with Bo. But Bo has no longer has feelings for Jun because she unknowingly fell in love with Keung. Keung's old thug friends askes him to join in on a kidnapping act, but he rejects.  Meanwhile, Ah-Man finally felt tired and guilty, and decided to set up a stable relationship with Fung. But Fung tells Man that he wants to break up. In the past six months, Fung was secretly dating his co-worker’s girlfriend Min ([[Miki Yeung]]). Fung finally decided to let go of Man and had chosen Min for a 'back up lover' relationship, which did not last because Min decided to get married with her real boyfriend. This gave Fung new insights and reminded him that he can never be her priority. Thus, he lets go of Man (who is sobbing at the breakup) because he feels she needs someone who can accept her as she is and who she can accept and feel safe with. They were incompatible and he had to put up with her, while she, on the other hand, did some horrible things to Fung, only to regret them immediately afterwards.  Soon, Keung's intentions on deceiving Kei Kei were exposed because her cousin was once deceived by him too. Keung pretends to form an alliance with Kei Kei to expose and humiliate Ah-Bo instead, making her devastated. A few months later, Jun's sweets shop went bankrupt when Kei Kei took all the money and fled. It turns out that it was part of Keung and his apprentice's plan to deceive her. While helping Jun recover from the loss of the sweets shop and employees, Jun and Bo got back together.  Keung, having successfully deceived Kei Kei and got all the money back, watches Bo and Jun from a distance. Bo notices him and walks out of dinner at their sweets shop. The old man that sells egg waffles confirms that her "boyfriend" Keung was there just a while ago. However, before Bo is able to meet up with Keung, his thug friends' failed kidnap attempts resulted in getting Keung involved, and he was beaten on the streets. Keung trudged his bloody body to Bo and Jun's restaurant, hoping to tell her that he loved her. Disappointed that she didn't find Keung, Bo walks back to her restaurant, not knowing that Keung had collapsed a block behind her restaurant and died from loss of blood. The movie ends with Bo and Man finally meeting up in real life, but Bo discovers that Man's new boyfriend was Jun.  'L for Love, L for Lies'' has a fascinating ending with a strange, maybe unthinkable twist, especially after what the story line evolved to. In summary, love can show its true form in the things we do that are not noticed — it is love when we do something good for a loved one, but it also takes the shape of lies (lies to make things better and maintain stability/protect loved ones, or lies for deception, e.g., cheating and dishonesty). There is a sharp contrast with the repenting Keung and Jun who gets a second chance (and the ending tells it all), as to who really loved Bo, despite the lies (the difference in the lies throughout the story and the way they followed these lies with actions).''

Largo chases him with the head of security, Stephan Marcus, but is unable to find him. He then goes to lunch with the W Group's competitor, Michail Korsky, and is shocked to find Léa with him. He follows her to a spa, where she flees from him, but he finds out that her real name is Naomi and that she works for him.  Soon after, Korsky announces he is going to buy the W Group. Ferguson wishes to secretly buy Korsky's corporation so he would be unable to do it, but it is only possible if the offer is made from a private individual, and Largo is the only one who is able to do so. Since the other members are unwilling to lend Largo the money to perform this, still skeptical about his actions, Largo decides he is going to bring them secret stocks that Nerio kept and trusted Largo with so he could prove to them who he is and to perform the deal.  Largo travels back to his childhood home in [[Dalmatia]], where he meets with Hana, who is now a widow, since Josip died years earlier. Largo also meets with Goran, who is now a soldier in the [[Croatian Army]]. They have a meal together before Goran leaves the family home. The next day, Hana wakes up and finds Largo gone, only finding a note from him. Soon enough, she is attacked by an armed group, led by Marcus, who have tracked Largo through a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] in his credit card. After finding out from the note that Largo has departed for [[Sarajevo]], Marcus kills her.   However, Largo has traveled to a secret island, containing a monastery, where Nerio has a secret safe in which he holds his stocks. After unlocking the safe, he is cornered by Marcus. After taking his shares, Marcus tries to kill him, but Largo escapes and jumps into the sea, although he is shot and badly injured. He wakes up next day in the home of his childhood friend, Melina, since her cousin found Largo unconscious.  Soon after, Largo contacts Freddy, telling him that he is still alive and that he will contact him soon. However, Freddy meets with Ferguson, who reveals that she organized Nerio's death in order to lure Largo. She also manipulated Korsky into announcing the buy-in of the W Group, and in turn, Largo would bring up the shares and Ferguson would secretly buy a controlling stake in Korsky's group, making her a very powerful person. She also admits that Naomi is working for her, and that she found Largo and falsely set up charges for drug dealing against him, and the senior employee who was killed in front of Largo planned to reveal her plans to Korsky. Freddy requests the plan for hostile takeover of Korsky's group so he could become a part to get rich in exchange for tracking down Largo. Ferguson agrees and sends Marcus for him, but he is tied up by him when Freddy contacts Largo again and tries to silently warn him about what is going on.  Meanwhile, Melina drives Largo to a small airport, where Korsky arrives in his private jet. Largo explains to Korsky about Ferguson's plans and Naomi's treachery, and that he has to go to [[Hong Kong]] before a large ceremony is planned, where Ferguson intends to announce the new heir to the W Group, apparently her secret weapon. Korsky agrees and withholds his original plan to buy the W Group. In Hong Kong, Korsky drives to the meet where he is cornered by Marcus, but cannot find Largo. Instead, Largo meets with Naomi, who reveals she is a mercenary for hire, and she contacts Marcus when Largo refuses to pay her up, and Largo agrees to pay her, and she leaves him the car.  However, Marcus catches up with Largo, intending to stop him from arriving to the meet. After a high-speed chase, Largo manages to enter the W Group headquarters, where he disguises himself. He arrives at the penthouse, where he, much to his shock, finds Goran. Goran recalls the events when he and Largo broke into the orphanage to find Largo's records. Largo was found and captured, but Goran managed to hide. He was about to leave, but kept searching the records about Largo, but found his ''own'' records, revealing that he isn't Hana and Josip's son but that he was also adopted by Nerio along with Largo, and as such, he is also an heir to Nerio's company. Ferguson contacted him and he agreed to represent the company while Ferguson would really have the power, in exchange for money. However, when Largo informs him that Ferguson, using Marcus, killed Hana, he changes his mind and agrees to help him.  However, Marcus arrives, and Goran pretends to help Marcus to kill Largo, while secretly telling him in [[Serbian language|Serbian]] that he is at Largo's side. They fight Marcus together, but Marcus manages to shoot Goran. A fight ensues between Largo and Marcus, who almost throws Largo off the building, until Largo uses the last of his strength to stab Marcus in the neck with a knife, killing him. Goran begs for Largo's forgiveness, and Largo forgives him as Goran dies from his injuries.   After rescuing Freddy, the two arrive at the meet, where Freddy plays a recording of his meeting with Ferguson while Largo arrives with his shares, which he took while visiting Goran. Defeated, Ferguson walks out of the stage and bitterly congratulates Largo for his victory. Largo announces to the gathered that he is Nerio's son, and plans to take over the W Group to a thunderous applause.  Some time later, Largo is back at his childhood village, when a young boy corners him with a stick and asks him to surrender, to which Largo jokingly agrees. Largo asks the boy for his name, and the boy introduces himself as Danis, and that he is trespassing at his territory. Largo apologizes and walks away, but the boy asks him for his name, and Largo introduces himself. Danis wishes him good luck. Largo smiles, and walks away. The film ends

Last Chance Harvey
 Divorced American Harvey Shine writes [[jingle]]s for [[Television advertisement|television commercials]], a job not in keeping with his dream of being a [[jazz]] pianist and composer. His position at work is tenuous as he departs for [[London]] to attend his daughter Susan's wedding. Upon arrival at [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]], he encounters Kate Walker, a single Londoner who works collecting statistics from passengers as they pass through the terminals. Tired and anxious to get to his hotel, Harvey brusquely dismisses her when she approaches him with the survey.  Arriving at his hotel Harvey discovers that he is the only wedding guest booked in there. He is hurt to discover that his ex-wife Jean has rented a house to accommodate everyone who is attending from the States, except him. At the dinner on the night preceding the wedding, it becomes increasingly clear Harvey is now an outsider to his daughter's life and is being excluded from the clan around his ex-wife's new husband Brian. Their politeness towards him is insincere and makes him feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. Harvey tells Susan that he will be attending the ceremony but not the reception because he has to urgently return to the States. Susan replies that, as her step-father, Brian has been more of a father to her in the last few years than Harvey has and that she is going to ask him to give her away at her wedding.   Meanwhile, Kate is on a [[wiktionary:blind date|blind date]] that is not going well. After taking a phone call from her neurotic mother Maggie, she returns to the table to discover that her date has bumped into friends at the bar and invited them to join them. Feeling socially awkward and excluded from the group, she eventually goes home.  The following morning Harvey attends the wedding and then leaves immediately for the airport, having been excluded again and seated at the back of the church instead of the front in his true place next to his daughter. Owing to the heavy London traffic he is delayed and misses his flight back to the States. When he calls his boss to advise him he will be returning later than planned he is fired. Needing to drown his sorrows, Harvey goes to an airport bar and sees Kate who is there having a solitary lunch. Recognizing her from the day before, he apologizes for his rude behavior. She initially resists the attention he is paying her but soon they're both glad to finally have an honest, genuine conversation with someone.  Harvey, feeling lonely and not wanting to stay in an hotel by the airport, follows Kate and joins her on the train to [[London Paddington station|Paddington station]]. He asks if he can walk her to her writing class on the [[South Bank]]. She accepts his offer and is pleased when he offers to wait for her and meet her afterwards. As they stroll along the South Bank [[River Thames]], Harvey mentions he is missing Susan's wedding reception, and Kate urges him to go. He finally relents, but only if she will accompany him. Kate insists that she is not properly dressed for such an occasion, so Harvey buys her a dress and the two head to the [[Grosvenor House Hotel]], where they are welcomed by Susan and squeezed in at two places on the children's table. When 'the-father-of-the-bride' is called upon to make a toast, Brian rises and begins to speak but Harvey interrupts claiming his right as her biological father. He then delivers a touching, eloquent speech that redeems him with his daughter and endears him to Kate.  Following the bride and groom's first wedding dance, the groom calls Harvey up to dance with his daughter. He happily does so, and then all the guests join them on the dance floor. Harvey is enjoying himself on the dance floor and Kate is left at the children's table, finding herself again in the same position as on the blind date. She starts to feel socially awkward and out of place, alone in the room full of strangers. Harvey is dancing and appears to have forgotten Kate. She bears her feelings as long as she can and eventually quietly leaves. Soon after Harvey returns to the table to find her gone.  Harvey, now looking for Kate, goes into the corridor and seeing her waiting for the elevator, he disappears into a side room where there is a piano and begins to softly play one of his own jazz compositions.  She hears the music and follows it, finding Harvey smiling and waiting for her.  He asks her to stay and return to the reception so he can dance her socks off. She agrees and they have a great time together.     Following the reception, Harvey and Kate walk and talk through London until dawn. Upon parting they exchange a single, gentle kiss and agree to meet at noon later that day. Back at his hotel, Harvey experiences serious heart palpitations having had to use the stairs as both lifts are out of order. He is taken to hospital. Forced to stay over night for treatment he misses the appointment with Kate, who turned up as agreed and waited for him. Upon being discharged the next day Harvey receives a call from his boss who has discovered that he needs Harvey to continue handling the account at work. He urges Harvey to return as soon as possible. Harvey quits his job, deciding he prefers to remain in London and explore the possibility of a relationship with Kate. He tracks down Kate's work number and calls her to explain but she refuses to take the call. He goes looking for her at the airport and eventually tracks her down at her writing class. He explains why he missed their rendezvous and tells her that he wants to stay in London and begin a relationship with her. Overcautious about romance because of so much past emotional pain, Kate resists, but finally agrees to give things a chance to his suggestion that they see what the future might bring.  As they slowly stroll away along the South Bank, Harvey invites Kate to ask him the questions she would have asked him at the airport terminal, and this time, he happily answers, telling her his place of residence "...is in transition."

The Last Straw (film)
 In March 1980, [[Takoma Records]] was about to re-release an audio recording on vinyl of a Charles Bukowski live poetry reading given in San Francisco years earlier. As part of the promotion of the album release, Bukowski agreed to give a new live reading, even though he hated doing them. Jon Monday, then General Manager of Takoma Records, video taped the event.<ref>[http://community.livejournal.com/ham_on_rye Link to story of reading on Bukowski fan site] </ref>  But by later that year Bukowski's book royalties and movie advances provided him enough of a living that he no longer had to do readings.  The Redondo Beach reading turned out to be the very last poetry reading Bukowski ever gave. The video recording of that night stayed in an archive until 2008 when [[mondayMEDIA]] entered into an agreement with Bukowski's widow Linda to release it on DVD.  Bukowski's readings were known for their riotous back and forth with the audience and this recording shows this in full color. Each poem is set between a tense dialog - with Bukowski giving and taking insults and threats with members of the audience. It ends with the prophetic words "This reading is over".

Leatherheads
 In 1925 Jimmy "Dodge" Connelly ([[George Clooney]]) is captain of the [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] Bulldogs, a struggling professional American football team.  Dodge is determined to save both his team and pro football in general when the players lose their sponsor and the league is on the brink of collapse. He convinces [[Princeton University]]'s college football star, Carter "the Bullet" Rutherford, to join the Bulldogs, hoping to capitalize on Carter's fame as a decorated hero of the [[World War I|First World War]] (like [[Alvin York]], he single-handedly captured a large group of [[Imperial German Army|German soldiers]]).  In addition to his legendary tales of combat heroism, Carter has dashing good looks and unparalleled speed and skill on the field.  As a result of his presence, both the Bulldogs and pro football in general begin to prosper.  ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' newspaper reporter Lexie Littleton becomes the object of the affections of both Dodge and Carter. Lexie has been assigned to find proof that Carter's war heroics are bogus. Carter confesses that the surrender of the Germans was a lucky accident and that his role in it was more foolish than heroic. Carter soon discovers Lexie's agenda and is doubly hurt when he learns that Dodge and Lexie are starting to show affections for each other and even shared a kiss. The ensuing fight over Lexie's affections puts her off. Spurred on by the threats of Carter's manager, she decides to publish the story.  The story sparks a firestorm of accusations and reprimands. Carter's manager resorts to shady dealing to cover it up, even bribing the original witness to change his story.  Dodge's attempts to legitimize pro football take on a life of their own. The new commissioner formalizes the game's rules, taking away improvisational antics. In addition, the commissioner takes the responsibility of clearing up the Carter controversy to set an example for the new direction of professional football.  With the whole world against Lexie (even the ''Tribune'' is pushing her to retract her story), Dodge concocts a clever ruse. Interrupting a private hearing in the commissioner's office, Dodge threatens Carter with a confrontation by his old army mates. Dodge claims that they are just outside the door, ready to congratulate him for his heroic actions. In truth, the men are Bulldogs in borrowed Army uniforms.  Carter confesses the truth. The commissioner frees Lexie from printing a retraction. Carter is ordered to simply say he got too much credit for his war actions, but must give a hefty part of his paycheck to the American Legion. Carter's conniving manager is banned from football as well. Dodge is warned that if he pulls any old tricks to win the next game, he will lose his place in the league.  Dodge plays in one last game. This time it will be against Carter, who has changed sides from Duluth to Chicago. The rivalry for Lexie's affection spills onto the field.  The game does not go well for Dodge, including how muddy the field is. Dodge decides football should be played without rules. Lexie notices that after a brawl, Dodge is missing and with most players covered in mud, no one can tell who is who. There appears to be an interception and Chicago seems to have won, but when the mud is removed it is seen that the player is none other than Dodge Connelly, who disguised himself as a Chicago player on the play. The play is changed from an interception to a touchdown, and the Bulldogs win.  Carter tells Dodge that Dodge is finished playing football, based on the threat the commissioner had made. He intends to tell the newspapers the real story about his "capture" of the German soldiers. Dodge argues that America "needs" heroes and it is implied the true story will not be told. Dodge and Carter part on good terms once again.  After the game, Dodge meets up with Lexie and they ride into the sunset on Dodge's motorbike, discussing with humor the possibilities in their future, which include bankruptcy, scandals and jail time.  During the end credits, pictures show Dodge and Lexie getting married, Carter donating $10,000 to the US military and Carter's former manager with new clients [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Lou Gehrig]].

The boy's friends are waiting for him to emerge, and go to see what is holding him up. Before he is discovered, Håkan pours concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]] onto his own face, disfiguring it to prevent the authorities from identifying him and tracing Eli. Eli learns that Håkan has been taken to the hospital and scales the building to access his restricted room. Håkan opens the window for Eli and offers his neck to her for feeding; after she has fed, Håkan falls out of the window onto the snow and dies. Now alone, Eli goes to Oskar's apartment and spends the night with him, during which time they agree to "go steady". While Eli states, "I'm not a girl", Oskar (ambiguously) either ignores this or accepts the unclear nature of the relationship.  During an ice skating [[field trip]] at the lake, some of Oskar's fellow students discover Jocke's body. At the same time, Oskar finally stands up to his tormentors and strikes the leader of the bullies, Conny, on the side of the head with a pole, splitting his ear. Some time later, Oskar shows Eli a private place he knows. Unaware that Eli is a vampire, Oskar suggests that they form a [[Blood brother|blood bond]], and cuts his hand, asking Eli to do the same. Eli, thirsting for blood but not wanting to harm Oskar, laps up his spilled blood before running away. Lacke's girlfriend, Virginia, is subsequently attacked by Eli. Lacke turns up in time to interrupt the attack. Virginia survives, but soon discovers that she has become painfully sensitive to sunlight. Seeking Lacke, Virginia visits Gösta, only to be fiercely attacked by Gösta's cats. In the hospital, Virginia, who has realized what she has become, asks an orderly to open the blinds in her room. When the sunlight streams in, she bursts into flames.  On realizing Eli's true nature, Oskar confronts Eli, who admits to being a vampire. Oskar is initially upset by Eli's need to kill people for survival. However, Eli insists that their bloodthirsty natures are alike, in that Oskar wants to kill and Eli needs to kill, and encourages Oskar to "be me, for a little while."  Lacke, who has lost everything because of Eli, tracks Eli down to the closed-off apartment. Breaking in, he discovers Eli asleep in the bathtub. He prepares to kill her, but Oskar, who was hiding inside the apartment, interferes; Eli immediately wakes up, jumps on Lacke and kills him, feeding on his blood. Eli thanks Oskar and kisses him in gratitude. However, an upstairs neighbor is angrily knocking on the ceiling due to the disturbance the fight has caused. Eli realizes that it is no longer safe to stay and leaves the same night.  The next morning, Oskar receives a phone call from Conny's friend, Martin, who lures Oskar out to resume the after-school fitness program at the local swimming pool. The bullies, led by Conny and his [[wikt:sadism|sadistic]] older brother Jimmy, start a fire to draw Mr Ávila, the teacher in charge, outside, and enter the pool area, ordering the other children to clear out. This leaves Oskar trapped alone in the pool. Jimmy forces Oskar under the water, threatening to stab his eye out if he does not hold his breath for three minutes. While Oskar is being held underwater, Eli arrives and rescues him by killing and dismembering the bullies, except for the most reluctant of their number, Andreas, who is left sobbing on a bench.  Later, Oskar is traveling on a train with Eli in a box beside him, safe from sunlight. From inside, Eli taps the word "kiss" to Oskar in Morse code, to which he taps back "''puss''" (small kiss in Swedish).

 In 1969, ten-year-old Frank Sears is confronted by his hysterical mother Eleanore, who carves the message "S3 V12" into the palms of his hands with a pencil and warns him to never forget her warning before murdering her husband and committing suicide.  In the present, Frank ([[Johnathon Schaech]]) is now a biology teacher haunted by the night his mother died. Having tried to forget about her warnings, he conducted an internet search that led him to drive all the way from [[New Jersey]] to the town of Bennell, [[New Mexico]] in an attempt to visit the Army base Fort Lambert. After being turned away he is forced to break through the gates of the base and is detained, at which point he explains his story to Carrie Freeborn ([[Erica Leerhsen]]) and her wheelchair-bound husband Glenn ([[Jason Wiles]]): his mother once worked at the base and warned him that something terrible was stored there, in "Sublevel 3, Vault 12." The Freeborns find no evidence of Elenore Sears in their records, and their documents of the base's decontamination indicate that the vault was empty. However, on another check, they discover the back wall is hollow and immediately begin excavation against Frank's warnings. Inside is a sealed tank, and on the orders of Colonel Erik Maitland ([[James McDaniel]]) a quarantine is set up so the tank can be opened by Carrie's team, consisting of herself, Torbin Struss (Josh Berry), Gayle Osterloh (Liezl Carstens) and Aneta McQueen (Charissa Allen).  They discover a man's corpse with evidence of disease inside, but when Carrie attempts to biopsy the infected tissue, the infection comes alive in the form of giant, rapidly growing plantlike roots. Struss is immediately killed when he tries to bolt the tank closed, and the organism grows out of the room in moments. An evacuation is declared, but Glen, Osterloh and many other soldiers are killed. Carrie frees Frank and confronts him with images of the man in the tank, but he is unresponsive. The soldiers withdraw into Bennell to form a response, and Frank realizes that Carrie meant that the man in the tank was his real father.  Frank and Carrie seek out Virgil Redwing (Lew Alexander), a shopowner who Frank thought recognized him when he asked for directions earlier. They learn that Virgil, Frank's father and Eleanore all worked at the base in 1958 and recover a package left to Virgil before Frank's father died. However, the organism reaches the abandoned church and kills Virgil. Frank and Carrie rescue Virgil's granddaughter Kaz (Haleigh Sanderson) and discover a film inside the package. Kaz advises them they can find a projector at her school, where the town has been evacuated to.  At the school, Frank and Carrie watch the film within the package, which is of Frank's father Yevgeni Tarasov (also played by Schaech), a Russian scientist who defected to the US and accidentally created the organism within his own body. Frank is infected by a sample given to Carrie by an elderly resident, but the organism dies within his body; he realizes that his blood possesses antibodies that can kill the organism due to his heritage.  The town is evacuated, and before his death, General Kenneth Lavigne (Rick Herod) orders a nuclear strike. However, Carrie and Frank realize this will cause disaster, as the organism can use any heat or light to grow further. Frank covers Carrie in his blood for protection and they fly in a stolen helicopter back to Fort Lambert so they can kill the organism. Inside, Carrie finds a boil on the vines with Glen's body inside and accidentally bursts it, washing off the blood. However, before she is killed, Frank uses his blood to kill the nucleus in his father's body. The nuclear strike is averted and the world is saved. Maitland, realizing they may have survived, sends an evacuation in to rescue them.

The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond
  The film tells the story of heiress Fisher Willow ([[Bryce Dallas Howard]]). Fisher returns home from overseas to find that her father has become a hated man in Memphis as he had intentionally blown up the southern half of his [[levee]] earlier that year, resulting in the deaths of 8–9 people and enormous property damage for anyone downstream. Fisher is to [[debutante|come out to society]] this season, but because of her father's reputation – and her inappropriate/wild behavior – she is unable to find a man willing to be her escort. She asks Jimmy ([[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]]) to be her escort for the season.  Though Jimmy is not currently her social equal, he is the grandson of the former governor and she was always taken with him. His father works at Fisher's commissary though he is a heavy drinker and is at risk of losing his job, and his mother was committed to an insane asylum and no longer recognizes her son. Jimmy agrees to be her escort as she is willing to pay him and he could use the money to help his parents. Fisher arranges for him to be outfitted properly, and promises that there are better places for Jimmy's mother.  Fisher borrows $10,000 teardrop diamond earrings from her aunt to wear to these social events. Fisher and Jimmy attend the first society party together, where she causes a scene when she has the band play [[Jazz|controversial music]] and dances in "[[flapper]]" fashion. Soon the entire party views her as a joke and laughs at her, insulting her father and the fact that she had to pay a man to be her escort. In response, Jimmy yells at everyone to shut up and helps Fisher to the car.  The only other social gathering that Fisher is invited to is a Halloween party, given by her friend Jules in northern Memphis, where no one knows of her father's previous actions. As he waits for Fisher to pick him up for the next party, Jimmy mentions to his father that Fisher seemed to be sending him the message that she wanted to become more intimate. Jimmy suggests that if he were to agree to be more than her escort, then it would certainly lead to marriage. This would mean a permanent job for his father and better care for his mother.  On the way to the Halloween gathering, Fisher asks Jimmy to stop up at the levee so she can look at the water. She rests her head on his shoulder before moving to kiss him. Jimmy, in spite of what he said to his father earlier, pulls back instead, causing Fisher to be hurt and embarrassed. When they arrive at the party, Fisher is so angry with Jimmy that she gets out of the car before it fully stops. When she straightens out her clothes, she realizes that one of her teardrop earrings has fallen off. Becoming frantic and somewhat hysterical – especially when Jimmy recognizes a girl outside, Vinnie, an old romantic interest of his – Fisher believes that the earring fell off when she walked away from the car and begins searching the ground for it. When she is unsuccessful, she remembers that she had rested her head on Jimmy's shoulder earlier and asks him to check his pockets to see if the earring was there. Jimmy misunderstands and thinks that Fisher is accusing him of stealing the jewelry. He becomes furious, as his father was fired from a job once for stealing, and demands that she search his jacket. Fisher, confused as to why he is so angry, refuses, causing Jimmy to go into the party and demand that he be searched down to the skin in order to clear his good name.  Fisher, needing to get away from all the commotion, goes upstairs where she meets her friend's Aunt Addie, who is bedridden and unable to move her limbs due to a series of severe strokes. Addie says that she senses a kindred spirit in her, the same character that will not bend to the rules of society, and tells Fisher of a drug she used to use – [[opium]] – before she was sick. She points to a bottle on the shelf and says it contains the last of her stash. She asks Fisher to give her all of the pills (since she is unable to move herself) so she can die and stop the pain. Fisher agrees, but before she can go through with it, she is interrupted by Vinnie telling her that Jimmy was searched and the earring was not on him. Fisher puts the bottle back on the counter and places her remaining earring next to it, promising Addie that when she comes back to get her earring, she would give her the rest of the opiates.  Fisher goes back downstairs to find everyone suspects her of "losing" her diamond on purpose so that she could blame Jimmy and not have to pay him for being her escort. Jimmy is still angry at Fisher for her accusation of theft and leaves her alone to go be with Vinnie. Soon, the people begin to play Post Office, a [[kissing game]]. Jules gives her the highest card so that she can call Jimmy away from the other girl and kiss him herself. Fisher, growing increasingly distant, hides in the bathroom. She finds a bottle of Addie's "medicine" which contains a small amount of opium and drains it. Drifting through the party, in a dreamy haze, she reveals to everyone that, while overseas, she was actually at a mental institution. Still in a daze, Fisher misses when Jules asks who has the highest card and so Jimmy, who had the next highest, calls Vinnie to go out on the porch with him instead of Fisher. When she realizes that he chose Vinnie over herself, Fisher goes to the piano and plays a beautiful song, crying the whole time.  In the meantime, Jimmy and Vinnie have sex in a car outside. Vinnie tells Jimmy that she had an offer of marriage from a respectable man, but turned him down because she wasn't attracted to him like she was to Jimmy. Claiming that she didn't want any secrets between them, she brings him over to the back garden and digs in the ground to unearth the missing teardrop diamond. She had seen it on the ground and taken it herself. Vinnie says she knows where the other one is (she saw where Fisher put), and that she and Jimmy could run away with the jewelry and start a life together. Jimmy refuses, telling her that just because they are poor, it doesn't mean they are without honor, and she should return the earring to Fisher. Vinnie, angry, runs away with the earring.  Jimmy goes to look for Fisher and finds her in the car. She says she wants to go home, but Jimmy won't let her leave (he wants to find Vinnie and get the earring back). Jimmy pulls Fisher out of the car and there is a brief moment when they are close and Fisher looks longingly at him, before they are interrupted by Vinnie. She came back to return the earring to Fisher. Jimmy yells that they can leave now that she has the earring back, but Fisher remembers her promise to Addie and runs back inside. After she leaves, Jimmy thanks Vinnie for doing the right thing. Vinnie says that they will probably never see each other again as her only option now is to go marry the gentleman who proposed earlier. They embrace, and Jimmy returns to the car to wait for Fisher. Fisher retrieves her other teardrop diamond and fulfills her promise to Addie, giving her the entire contents of the bottle and bidding her farewell. Addie tells her to go with God. Fisher replies that she is: she's leaving with Jimmy.  On the way home, Fisher asks Jimmy to stop at the same levee they went to before the party so she can see the moon on the water. They stand on the levee together, and Fisher tells him that she intends to fix her father's mistake and that she can't run away anymore. She makes an offer to Jimmy: that his mother will be taken care of, his father will always have a job, and while she knows that no one could ever love her, he could get used to her. She reaches up to touch his face, but he pulls away again. Heartbroken, Fisher turns to walk away, only to find that Jimmy had grabbed her hand – a silent agreement to her proposal. She turns back to him and once again rests her head on his shoulder.  
Lorna's Silence

Lorna's dream is to own a snack bar with her boyfriend, Sokol. In order to see this dream fulfilled, she agrees to have another fake marriage with a Russian man, but Claudy is in the way. Fabio, the one who orchestrated the whole plan, will not wait for Lorna and Claudy's divorce.  Initially Lorna had agreed to Fabio's plan of killing Claudy with an overdose. But Lorna is moved by Claudy's determination to stay clean, so she pleads Fabio to wait for their divorce. But Fabio does not understand why Lorna cares, and an overdose will not look suspicious, because drug addicts often relapse.  Claudy attempts to stay off of drugs by locking himself in his apartment and asking Lorna to get him medicine at the pharmacy that will help with his pains. One night, the pain becoming unbearable, and he asks Lorna to call his doctor and take him to the hospital. There, he begs Lorna to stay with him until the nurse comes. He leans against her like a child in need of protection.  In order to obtain a quick divorce, Lorna decides to hurt herself and make it look like Claudy abused her. She does not manage to convince Claudy to beat her and ends up hurting herself at the hospital and crying out for help. The nurse who looks after her agrees to act as a witness for the police report. The same day, Lorna goes to the station and fills out a report. Fabio, who seems to control everything, has her followed, and he asks her why she went to the police station. She explains that the divorce will be faster since she has found a way to make it look like Claudy is a physically abusive husband.  The next day, Claudy gets out of the hospital and goes to see Lorna at her workplace. He asks for money (Claudy has asked Lorna to carry his money for him to prevent him from using it on drugs) to buy cigarettes and to prepare a meal for when she gets back from work.  Later that night, Lorna receives a letter from the judge granting her a quick divorce. She leaves a depressed Claudy behind to let Fabio know the news. When she tells Fabio that the divorce will now only take a month, he does not look pleased. She asks him to talk to the Russians and see if they will accept the delay. A short while after, as Lorna crosses the street to enter her apartment, Fabio in his taxi honks and as she gets close, telling her that the Russian has accepted to wait.  At home, Claudy has invited one of his drug dealers over. Lorna forces the drug dealer out, locks the door, throws the key out of the window, and makes love to Claudy.  The next day, Claudy and Lorna, who look like a content couple, go to a shop to get a new pair of keys and a bike for Claudy to pass the time and take his mind off drugs. After having agreed to see Claudy at her workplace at noon, Lorna runs playfully after his bike.  In the next scene, Lorna carefully chooses a pair of jeans that she puts in a bag that previously contained Claudy's belongings. Then, she goes to the morgue where she gives the clothes and asks to see Claudy once more. Later, she packs up a bag under the watchful eye of Fabio and Spirou, his assistant. Fabio tells her it was necessary to get rid of Claudy as the Russians would not have waited. He explains that she would not have accepted his decision, so he could not have told her. He offers her a thousand euros for staying with Claudy and helping him out with his addiction. Lorna does not take the money. As they are heading out, two detectives ask to speak to Lorna. They question her about Claudy, and after a while she tears up. The detectives leave, apparently convinced of her sincerity and innocence.  Lorna goes back to her old apartment and finds a place to rent for the snack bar with Sokol. She also meets the Russian man she is going to marry. She accepts the money Fabio gives her for her future marriage and even takes the one thousand euros that she had previously refused. In the meantime, she discovers that she is pregnant. She goes to the hospital to get an abortion, but finds that she cannot do it. She does not wait for the ultrasound and runs out of the doctor's office. When she tells Fabio that she is pregnant, he insists upon an abortion, mumbling that Sokol and she were crazy for not being careful. Lorna goes to the bank to open an account for her unborn child. The clerk tells her that the money can only be transferred to an actual account upon her child's birth. When the clerk asks for the baby's last name, she says "Moreau," which was Claudy's last name. Despite Fabio having told her not to talk about it, Lorna brings up the baby to the Russian during their second meeting. The Russian says through his interpreter that a baby is out of the question, and Fabio gets angry with Lorna for bringing it up. After the Russians' departure, Fabio roughs out Lorna and shouts that she must do exactly what he tells her to. Lorna crouches down while holding her stomach.  At the hospital where Fabio takes her, the doctor tells Lorna that she is not pregnant. But Lorna seems convinced that she is. On her way to the hospital room where they want to keep her overnight, she meets the doctor who took care of Claudy. She asks the doctor if she remembers her, explains that she is Claudy's wife, and requests that the doctor come say hi to her later.  Fabio realizes that he can no longer use Lorna, so he meets up with her and Sokol and takes back a good amount of the money he had given her. The next day, Lorna once again has packed up all her things, and Fabio takes her sim card from her cell phone before she enters the car that Spirou, Fabio's assistant, is driving. In the car, when Lorna asks Spirou why he has not taken the highway, he says that he needs to go to a gas station. When the next gas station is in view, Lorna tells him that she will use the bathroom while he buys gas. But Spirou says that he must go to a specific gas station, not that one. Lorna realizes then that Spirou has received the order to kill her. She asks Spirou to stop because she needs to relieve herself. He accepts to let her go urinate, but keeps her bag in the car. Once she is outside, Lorna takes a rock and hides it under her coat as she crouches to pee. Back in the car, she hits Spirou twice and runs out into the woods.  The movie ends as Lorna arrives at a little cabin in the woods where she decides to spend the night. She goes out to find wood and talks to her imaginary baby, telling him that she will not let it die like she let Claudy die.

Chris and Nicole go to the party, where Shane and his friends Kyle, Erik and Jon are entertaining themselves with the human guests. Chris showers with a girl named Lisa and Shane gets Nicole alone, chats with her for a bit, and then tricks her into drinking his blood. When Chris learns that Nicole has been with Shane, he angrily, and protectively, takes her home, where she begins to manifest vampiric strength and rage. But before Nicole kills Chris, she is knocked out by Edgar, who reveals that he is a vampire hunter, and Nicole has been infected with vampirism. Chris throws Edgar out of the house. Then, Lisa shows up and pretends to chat with Chris for a bit before she finally tries to seduce and feed on him. In fending her off, he accidentally impales her on a mounted rack of antlers, killing her explosively when she turns into stone and explodes.  Finally convinced of the situation, remembering what Edgar said and believing that he was right, Chris seeks out Edgar's help. Edgar explains that Nicole is only half-vampire, and will remain that way unless she feeds, and she can be turned human again if they kill the head vampire before that. Chris interrupts her just before she can feed on Evan Monroe, a nice guy who has been courting her, and explains what is happening to her, and Nicole is surprised at what she almost did (because she believes herself to be a vegetarian). However, Shane draws her to their lair and they have sex.  Chris and Edgar—who lost an unnamed sibling to the vampires—plot for Chris to "join" the tribe of vampires in order to learn the location of their lair.

Meanwhile, Shane goads Nicole to kill Evan, whom they have bound and gagged for her, but she refuses. With Chris' help, she impales Shane with a stake. Just as Shane attempts to pull Nicole onto the stake with him, Chris appears with a sword and decapitates him with it, returning them both to normal. They thank Edgar, who promises to bill them for his services, and Evan takes the opportunity to ask Nicole for a date. At home, they are confronted by their aunt, who believes they have been doing drugs, and promises zero tolerance.  In a mid-credits scene, Edgar encounters Sam Emerson, now a vampire. They exchange some dialogue and charge at each other as the credits resume.  ===Alternate endings=== In one alternate ending, Edgar is cleaning up after the vampire hunt, when Sam Emerson (who is not a vampire) knocks on his door. Sam warns him that his brother Alan is coming to settle the score. Edgar is reluctant to accept Sam's help, but Sam insists he needs it.

Pitka's dream is to become the number #1 Guru and appear on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. He lives a charmed life with thousands of followers, including the celebrities [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Val Kilmer]] and [[Mariska Hargitay]]. His teachings, which involve simplistic acronyms and plays on words, are displayed in [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint slide]] shows.  In Canada, Jane Bullard inherits the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] hockey team, who are on a losing streak; her star player, Darren Roanoke, has been playing badly ever since his wife Prudence left him for the rival [[Los Angeles Kings]] player, Jacques "Lè Cocq" Grandé.

Pitka advises Darren to write an apology to Prudence, and fights off a rooster to deliver the letter. After they lose three games, Coach Cherkoff berates Jane and punches Pitka in the groin. He is only slightly injured from hitting the chastity belt but Pitka moans and drops to the ground.  Pitka and Darren attempt a confrontation, but her invective ends up scaring both of them away. Pitka helps Darren realise that since his mother only showed him love when he succeeded he had grown to believe Prudence would only love him as long as he won. Pitka then drives himself and Darren to Niagara Falls for a "Heart to Heart".  With time running out, Pitka distracts Le Cocq with his idol, [[Celine Dion]], then tells Prudence that Darren stood up to his mom, encouraging her to return to her husband. During the lead up to the final game, Le Cocq, having heard that Darren cannot play with his mother in the audience, gets her to sing the national anthem, causing Darren to flee. At the airport on his way to guest on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|''Oprah'']], Pritka sees the news on television and defies his agent by going back to help Darren. After smoothing things over with his mother, Darren recovers until Le Cocq brags that Prudence prefers him in bed. Darren freezes and Pitka realizes he needs another distraction, which he provides by getting two elephants to have sex in the middle of the rink, in front of the live TV audience. Darren wakes up from his stupor and scores the winning goal. After the game, Pitka makes up with Jane and Coach Cherkov, then meets Deepak Chopra and decides that he is fine with being the first Guru Pitka instead of the next Deepak Chopra.  Back in India, Guru Tugginmypudha tells Pitka that he has finally learned to love himself and removes Pitka's chastity belt, revealing there was a hook in the back.

Upon arrival at the [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], the three strangers discover all outbound flights have been cancelled due to a lengthy [[Power outage|blackout]] that ended just prior to their arrival.

When Dunn discovers that a guitar similar to the one she is returning to her boyfriend's parents recently sold at an online auction for $22,000, she is tempted to give it to Cheaver, but he encourages her to complete her mission.  Dunn is welcomed warmly by her boyfriend's parents, Tom ([[John Diehl]]) and Jeanie Klinger ([[Annie Corley]]), but quickly discovers that not only nothing he had told her about himself and his past was true, but he had omitted some important details as well.

The Klingers invite Dunn to spend the remainder of her leave with them. Disillusioned, she declines, but she asks if she can keep the guitar, and they readily agree.  Dunn, Cheaver, and Poole are reunited at the local police station.

Mad Money (film)
 The film begins ''[[in medias res]]'', with the suspects getting caught and being interrogated. Then it flashes back to three years earlier and the film continues forward from there, interspersed with occasional bits from the interrogation.  Three years before getting caught, Bridget Cardigan ([[Diane Keaton]]) lived a comfortable upper middle class life until her husband Don Cardigan ([[Ted Danson]]) was "downsized" from his position and sank into debt. The paycheck for Selina, the housecleaner, bounces again. Selina confronts Bridget and suggests she take a job as a janitor at the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City]].  On her first day on the job, Bridget hatches a scheme to steal worn-out dollar bills slated for destruction. For her team she chooses Nina ([[Queen Latifah]]), who works the dollar bill shredder, and Jackie ([[Katie Holmes]]), who takes bill carts from the Secret Service room to the shredding room. It takes some work to persuade Nina to join, but Jackie joins them quickly.  The plan is that in the Secret Service room Bridget will switch a cart's official Master-brand lock with a near identical lock she purchased at [[Home Depot]]. Bridget will tell Jackie the cart number and give Nina the official lock. When Jackie gets the chosen cart, she dumps some bills from the cart into a trash can before taking the cart to Nina, who then uses Bridget's key to open it and restores the official lock, and then proceeds to shred the remaining bills. Meanwhile, Bridget, in the course of her janitorial duties, retrieves the dumped bills from the trash and splits them among Nina and Jackie in the women's restroom.  Their first robbery is a success though the take is not as big as they had hoped. However, they're emboldened to do it repeatedly. Once Don and Bridget pay off their debt, Don suggests they stop before they get caught. Bridget rejects this idea and persuades Nina and Jackie to keep going. They almost get caught but they end up cutting in Barry ([[Roger Cross]]), one of the security guards, who is attracted to Nina.  A Federal Bank Examiner shows up at a party at Bridget's house, and the next day Bridget sees him at work. The Examiner confronts Glover ([[Stephen Root]]), who is unwilling as a matter of professional pride to admit anyone has stolen a single bill out of his bank. Tipped off, that night Bridget and her accomplices begin trying to get rid of all the loot stashed in their houses, but the cops move in before all the evidence is destroyed. Bridget escapes but the others get caught.  Bridget hires a tax attorney to defend them. The lawyer gets Bridget and all her accomplices off the hook for their crimes, because neither the law enforcement, nor the examiner can ''prove'' that the large stash of cash in their homes came from the Federal Reserve Bank. Technically, it isn't illegal to have a couple of hundred thousand dollars in cash lying around inside a private residence. However, they spent a large sum of that stolen cash to buy expensive objects and improvements on their houses, and did not pay the taxes for them because they couldn't justify the income. The IRS demands they pay their taxes, which turn out to be equal in amount to the money that still remains.  Eight months later, Bridget reveals to Nina and Jackie that she had stashed away much of the stolen money in the basement of a friend's bar.

Dave told her that she loved him and she trusted a secret to him. Mira learned that Paul had another sexmate before which caused their relationship to deteriorate. Even her blind child, Sophie seemed aloof and is scared of her. She started to patch things up between her and her family but she could not forget what Dave told her about trusting him her secret. Mira called up Dave to meet him and Dave explained to her the secret she seemed to have forgotten already because of the accident. Dave told her how she had a twin sister named Maria that she left in a mental institute because she had been insane since their mother's death. Mira and Dave went to the mental institute to see Maria but the doctor said that Maria had died a month back and since no one claimed her body, they took the corpse to a University for study. She told Paul about this which surprised him, all along not knowing that Mira ever had a twin sister. Paul called the university to claim the corpse and then had it cremated.  Mira and Paul's daughter, Sophie, underwent an eye transplant. Sophie was so excited to see the eclipse as this is her first time to see again since she got blind. The moment she opened her eyes, she saw a woman standing behind her mother and the people around were wondering who she was seeing since no other people were there.  Paul and Mira could no longer take the paranormal activity so they decided to consult a medium to help them. The old man told Mira and Paul that a powerful black magic is due to acquire a physical body on the eclipse when all spirits become more powerful. The medium found a doll which he called "antigua", a powerful device that the bad spirit used to let itself remain in this world. On the night of the eclipse, Sophie and Paul were watching the phenomenon when Paul caught a glimpse of something white approaching them. It was Maria's body. He took Sophie inside the house and in her room, he found a tape which when he played in Sophie's video cam recorder, he saw it was recorded by Mira for him. The video showed Mira videotaping herself before the car accident she went through. Mira was saying in the tape how Paul could fight Maria. In the room where Mira was, her body became that of Maria. The twist was then revealed. It was Maria who came back from the car accident and it was Mira who died in the asylum and got cremated. Mira had been dead all along and it was Maria who used her body to come back to the world and take vengeance against Mira through her family.  Mira recalled that their mother was a mangkukulam and tried to transfer her powers to the twins when they were young. Being the braver one, Mira tried to contradict their mother's chants as she did not want to learn about her evil doings and voodoo magic. When the twin grew up, Mira decided to run away from home, leaving Maria behind. Their mother died soon after. Mira attended the burial and realized that Maria had gone insane, claiming she could talk to things that Mira could not see. Mira then told her twin that she would bring her with her to Manila. It turned out though that Mira sent her to a mental institute. Maria was left heartbroken. One night, she stayed up late and did a powerful black magic so that her and Mira's body could switch. The chant was effective although when Maria's soul transferred to Mira's body who was on the way to the mental asylum to stop Maria from doing any harm to her family, the car got into a horrible accident. Maria, who woke up in Mira's body could no longer remember anything while Mira who found herself in Maria's body woke up from the trance already in the asylum.  In the present, Paul replayed the video tape that Mira left for him. Mira said that by the time that Paul got to watch the video, she would have been dead. Paul needed to trap Maria into a circle made of Mira's body's dust. Paul did this but Maria discovered the trick. She was pushed through by Sophie from behind and there, she was trapped in the circle of dust. Paul stabbed the "antigua" with a piece of wood and Maria's soul burned and disappeared. Mira's soul showed up to the father and daughter to bid her final farewell. It is hinted at the end that Mira's Daughter Sophie saw the book that is used in "kulam"

A Man Who Was Superman
 Song Soo-jung is a producer going on her third year at a small company. Her speciality is filming human interest stories. She is driven to produce these shallow stories for the sake of her ambition of one day becoming Korea's own Oprah Winfrey. However, she is reaching the end of what's left of her pride. After months of not getting paid, one day she leaves her office as usual with the company camera to produce a story on a lion apparently refusing to eat its meal. On her way, however, she comes across a robber, but she is saved somehow by "Superman" in a Hawaiian shirt. Superman claims he's unable to tap into his superhuman powers because "bad guys" have placed kryptonite inside his head. However, he doesn't let that get in his way of helping others, and saving the world from global warming and rescuing a lost puppy. Soo-jung can see this will make a good story and, with a little tweaking and a little fabricating, she produces the "Superman Saves the World" documentary which goes on to be a ratings hit. After an X-Ray examination of "Superman's" skull, it becomes clear that there really is something stuck in his head - a bullet. However, the true story behind this Superman (whose real name is Lee Hyuk-Suk), is revealed: two major tragedies that befell Hyun-Suk traumatized him and left him believing he was, in fact, Superman. When Lee was a boy, he saw ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' with his father, who told him that if he counted to one-hundred, he would become Superman. Caught in a skirmish during the [[Gwangju Democratization Movement]], Lee's father is killed, and the young Lee is shot in the back of the head. Miraculously, he lived with the bullet still lodged in his skull. Years later Lee, his wife, and daughter were hit in a car accident. His wife died instantly, but his daughter survived. In the burning wreckage, Lee told his daughter if she counted to one hundred, he'd turn into Superman to save her. Unfortunately, just as he was running to the car with a fire extinguisher, the bullet in his head caused a seizure, causing him to collapse on the road. As he writhed on the ground in pain, the car exploded with his daughter still inside. None of the onlookers in the crowd attempted to help Lee or his daughter. It was at this moment when mental trauma caused Lee to believe he was Superman.  Lee lives his life with the belief that he is indeed Superman. Soo-jung follows Lee around as he attempts to help the community in his bizarre fashion. With his "super-deeds" Lee inspires hope within the community and people begin to follow his example. But this change Lee inspired only manifests when he has lost all hope in attempting to rescue a police officer from underneath a burning car. It's at this moment that people help Lee in trying to rescue the police officer. But when Lee attempts to save a child from a burning building, he ends up going in alone. In the collapsing building Lee couldn't find any way to escape, so he ends up jumping out of a window with the child, landing on his head. From there he flies and goes back in time to save himself from the bullet that hits Lee in his childhood. He returns to the present (Sadly, it was all a dream...) where in actuality he died landing on his head saving the child. No one in the crowd helped as they just looked on. In the hospital there appeared to be an "S" when they were about to take his organ.  Soo-jung is inspired by Lee's sacrifice and follows his example by helping an old woman. From then on Soo-jung remembers a phrase used by Lee Hyun-Suk when they first met - "Strength doesn't open big iron doors but a small key." This helps the frosty, calculating Soo-jung to awaken to what's truly important in life.

 Soon after their wedding, John and Jenny Grogan ([[Owen Wilson]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]]) escape the brutal Michigan winters and relocate to a cottage in South Florida, where they are hired as reporters for competing newspapers. At ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]'', Jenny immediately receives prominent front-page assignments, while at the ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'', John finds himself writing obituaries and two-paragraph articles about mundane news like a fire at the local garbage dump.  When John senses Jenny is contemplating motherhood, his friend and co-worker Sebastian Tunney ([[Eric Dane]]) suggests the couple adopt a dog to see if they're ready to raise a family. From a litter of newborn yellow [[Labrador retriever]]s they select Marley (named after reggae singer [[Bob Marley]]), who immediately proves to be incorrigible. They take him to Ms. Kornblut ([[Kathleen Turner]]), who firmly believes any dog can be trained, but when Marley refuses to obey commands, she blows her whistle and Marley runs towards her and tackles her, pinning her to the ground and humping her on her leg. That gets Marley too far and Ms. Kornblut expels him from her class.  Editor Arnie Klein ([[Alan Arkin]]) offers John a twice-weekly column in which he can discuss the fun and foibles of everyday living. At first stumped for material, John realizes the misadventures of Marley might be the perfect topic for his first piece. Arnie agrees, and John settles into his new position. Marley continues to wreak havoc on the household, providing John with a wealth of material for his column, which becomes a hit with readers and helps increase the newspaper's circulation. Jenny becomes pregnant, but loses the baby early in her first trimester. She and John travel to [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] for a belated honeymoon, leaving the rambunctious dog in the care of a young woman who finds him impossible to control, especially during the frequent thunderstorms that plague the area. Soon after returning from their vacation, Jenny discovers she is pregnant again, and this time she delivers a healthy boy, Patrick. When she has a second son, Connor, she opts to give up her job and become a stay-at-home mom, prompting John to take on a daily column for a pay increase. Due to the crime rate, the couple decides to move to a larger house in the safer neighborhood of [[Boca Raton]], where Marley delights in swimming in the backyard pool.

Some time later, John and Jenny welcome a daughter, Colleen, into their family.  John celebrates his 40th birthday and later goes skinny dipping with Jenny in their swimming pool. Increasingly disenchanted with his job, he decides to accept a position as a reporter with ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' with Jenny's blessing, and the family moves to a farm in rural Pennsylvania. John soon realizes that he is a better columnist than reporter and pitches the column idea to his editor. Life is idyllic until the aging Marley begins to show signs of arthritis and deafness. An attack of [[gastric dilatation volvulus]] almost kills him, but he recovers. When a second attack occurs, it becomes clear surgery will not help him, and Marley is euthanized with John at his side. The family pay their last respects to their beloved pet as they bury him beneath a tree in their front yard.  
Martyrs (2008 film)
 In 1971, a young girl, Lucie Jurin, escapes from a disused [[Slaughterhouse|abattoir]] where she has been imprisoned and physically abused for more than a year. The perpetrators and their motivations remain a mystery. Lucie is placed in an orphanage, where she is befriended by a young girl named Anna Assaoui, who quickly discovers that Lucie believes that she is constantly being terrorized by a ghoulish creature - a disfigured, emaciated woman. Even so, Anna comforts Lucie every time she has a nightmare.  Fifteen years later, Lucie bursts into the home of an apparently normal family, the Belfonds - Gabrielle, her husband, and their children Antoine and Marie - and kills them all with a shotgun. Elsewhere, Anna waits for Lucie. Although Anna knows that Lucie believes the Belfonds are the people responsible for her childhood abuse, she is horrified when Lucie tells her that she has killed them. Upon arriving at the house, Anna discovers that Gabrielle is still alive and tries to help her escape, but Lucie bludgeons Gabrielle to death. Lucie is again attacked by the scarred creature, but Anna only sees Lucie hurting herself; the 'creature' is nothing more than a psychological manifestation of Lucie's guilt for leaving behind another girl who was also tortured with her as a child. Lucie, realizing that her insanity will never leave her, commits suicide.<ref></ref>  The next day, Anna, still at the family's house, telephones her mother, from whom she has been estranged; their conversation implies that Anna suffered abuse from her parents as a child. Suddenly, Anna hears some noises and discovers a secret underground chamber in the living room. Imprisoned within is a horribly tortured young woman named Sarah, who proves that Lucie was right about the family. Anna helps Sarah escape, but a group of strangers arrive and gun Sarah down. Captured, Anna meets their leader, an elderly lady referred to as Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle explains that she belongs to a secret philosophical society seeking to discover the secrets of the afterlife through the creation of "martyrs". Their experiments inflict systematic acts of torture upon young women in the belief that their suffering will result in a [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] insight into the world beyond this one. Mademoiselle also believes the world is divided into victims (people who can't hold tortures and fall into madness, like Lucie and Sarah) and martyrs (people who "accept" tortures and transcend).  Anna becomes the group's latest subject. After a period of being beaten and degraded, Anna hallucinates a conversation with Lucie, and is later told she has progressed further than any other test subject, and has reached the "final stage." She is [[Flaying|flayed]] alive and survives the procedure, entering a state that is "euphoric" and likened to achieving transcendence. Mademoiselle arrives eagerly and Anna whispers into her ear.  Members of the society gather at the house to learn of the insights Anna shared with Mademoiselle. As he waits, Mademoiselle's assistant asks her if what Anna said was clear. Mademoiselle says yes, then asks him if he could imagine what comes after death. When he says no, she tells him to "keep doubting" before producing a handgun and committing suicide.  The film ends with a shot of Anna on the table, in a catatonic state.

Max corners Lupino at his warehouse hideout, and during their battle, Max's defeat appears to be certain until BB arrives, killing Lupino and knocking Max unconscious as they leave.  BB explains that he is selling Valkyr and admits to killing Michelle because she inadvertently came across incriminating documents.

He swims to shore and, to prevent hypothermia, consumes both vials of Valkyr, transforming into a super-soldier with visions of Valkyries. Max follows BB back to the Aesir building.

During rehearsals Richard accidentally sets off the sprinkler system, soaking the entire theatre. When accused by Welles he denies having anything to do with the deluge, and suggests that the catastrophe was the bad luck that Welles needed to get out of the way.

Meet Dave
 In his [[New York City]] apartment, a young boy named Josh Morrison (Austyn Lind Myers) stares through his telescope at an object falling from the sky. It is a golf-ball-sized metal ball which flies through the window and lands in his fishbowl, quickly draining the water along with the goldfish. He decides to show it at his school's science class presentation.  Some months later a massive fireball crashes into the water near [[Liberty Island]]. It is revealed to be a spaceship which resembles a human ([[Eddie Murphy]]), controlled by 100 tiny humanoid aliens. Its Captain (also played by Murphy) pilots the spaceship from the command deck located in its head, with the help of his second-in-command Number 2 ([[Ed Helms]]), and researcher Number 3 ([[Gabrielle Union]]). The spaceship looks very human, and displays numerous superpowers, but the aliens don't know how to make the "ship" act like a human. A superstitious cop named Dooley ([[Scott Caan]]) desperately searches for the alien.  The aliens need to save their planet, Nil, from an energy crisis. They need salt, which they plan to take by draining the Earth's [[ocean]]s using the metal ball, so they have to recover the ball. After the spaceship is hit by Josh's single mother, Gina Morrison ([[Elizabeth Banks]]), while driving, the Captain decides to befriend Gina and Josh. He tells them his name is Dave Ming Chang, based on a quick scan of common Earth names. At Gina's home the crew see their missing ball in a photograph taken at the science presentation. After having breakfast with Gina, "Dave" goes to Josh's school where he pretends to be a substitute teacher and eventually is able to talk to Josh alone. Josh tells him that the ball was taken from him by a bully (Nicholas Berman). With Josh's help, Dave takes the metal ball back from the bully.  The Captain (via Dave) spends some time with Josh and Gina and realizes that humans are more advanced than they originally thought. The crew observes humans displaying feelings and love, such as witnessing Gina's painting or a homeless man offering to share his blanket with Dave when he sleeps in a doorway. The Captain decides to cancel the plan to drain the oceans because it would destroy life on Earth. The police track Dave down using the impression of his face found in the dirt at the crash site and they arrest him. After spending so much time on Earth, most of the crew begin to exhibit new "feelings", adopting Earth's culture, mannerisms and general laid-back attitude. Number 2 decides that the captain and the rest of the crew's changing behavior is unacceptable and takes command of the "ship", imprisoning the Captain. Under Number 2's command, Dave breaks out of the police station and another attempt is made to arrest him. Number 3, who has become infatuated with the Captain, becomes jealous of Gina. She first cooperates in the command change but later agrees with the Captain's view on humans. Both are caught by Number 2 and they are expelled from the spaceship. In the meantime, Number 17 ([[Kevin Hart (actor)|Kevin Hart]]),  a young, fun-loving alien, jumps out of the "ship" while [[Drunkenness|drunk]] from the alcohol Dave has imbibed. The Captain apologizes to Number 3 for ignoring her. He admits that he too loves her and wants to be with her. Back at the police station, Dooley discovers Number 17 in his coffee and interrogates him to find out where Dave is going.  Number 2 takes Dave to the harbor, where he tries to throw the metal orb into the ocean, but is stopped by the Captain and Number 3, both of whom managed to gain reentry back onto the ship. They convince the rest of the crew that the real Captain is in charge again. Reinstated, he orders Number 2 to be stuck in the ship's "butt" forever. The metal orb meanwhile slips out of Dave's hand and rolls into the ocean. The Captain attempts to retrieve the orb but is told that they only have enough power to either retrieve it or return home. The Captain decides to save the Earth and the rest of the crew agrees. The ball, thrown in the ocean by Number 2, is retrieved. Dave powers down while Dooley and his partner catch up and point their guns at him. With no power, Dave's shields are disabled, leaving the crew defenseless. Josh tries to tell the police officers that Dave is harmless but is ignored. He then grabs Dooley's taser which he uses on Dave, recharging him. The captain and Number 3 reveal themselves to the police officers who stand down. The Captain says goodbye to Josh and Gina saying he now understands love. Number 17 is then returned to Dave by Dooley. About to fly away, a team from the FBI arrives and throws a net over Dave. While the FBI agents wrestle the body down, "Dave's" crew evacuates to one of the ship's "lifeboat" shoes, activate the engines, detaches the shoe and heads home to Nil, leaving behind both the ship and Number 2. While in the lifeboat, the captain asks for Number 3's hand in marriage. She accepts and they kiss.

Years later, Leonidas is [[Child abuse|training]] his son when Captain ([[Kevin Sorbo]]) informs him that a Persian messenger has arrived. Accompanied by the Spartan politician Traitoro, the messenger presents [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]' demands for Sparta's submission. After growing angry with both the messenger's disrespect and finding him making out with his wife, Leonidas kicks him into the "[[pit of death]]". Despite Traitoro's advice that the messenger's guards are now needed to convey the actual message, Leonidas kicks them in as well, along with several other people he simply dislikes. Resolving to face the [[Persia]]ns, Leonidas visits the prophets and gives them medicines such as [[Neutrogena]] as their prize for their consultation. They advise him that he should consult the [[Oracle]] for any advice. The Oracle, [[Ugly Betty]], reveals that Leonidas will die should he go to war.  After reaching a decision while spending the night with his wife, Leonidas meets the soldiers assembled for his departure to [[Thermopylae]], and finds that only thirteen were accepted in the army due to stringent requirements. Among them are Captain, his son Sonio, and a slightly unfit Spartan named Dilio. Once at the Hot Gates, they encounter a deformed [[Paris Hilton]] (also played by Parker), who tells Leonidas and the Captain about a secret goat path above the Hot Gates that Xerxes could use to outflank the Spartans. When she asks to be made a Spartan soldier, Leonidas rejects her as unqualified due to her inability to use a spear correctly. Leonidas and his platoon soon face off with Xerxes' messenger and his Immortals, beating them in a [[Stomp the Yard|dance contest]] before driving them off a cliff. Xerxes ([[Ken Davitian]]), impressed, personally approaches Leonidas and attempts to [[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|bribe him]] with a trip to the [[Palms Hotel and Casino]]. Leonidas declines, and the Spartans face the [[Persia]]n army in a "[[Mother insult|Yo Momma]]" fight, which the Spartans win, but Dilio has his eyes scratched out and wanders away.  Hilton decides to betray the Spartans and reveals the location of the goat path to Xerxes in return for various gifts and for having her deformed hump removed. Xerxes meets the twelve remaining Spartans and the war begins. Meanwhile, back in Sparta, Queen Margo has several confrontations with Traitoro, as he is the vital vote in sending more troops to assist her husband. Following her address to the Council, Traitoro publicly betrays the Queen. The Queen then battles Traitoro in a parody of ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' and defeats him using a [[Black & Decker DustBuster|dust buster]]. With Traitoro's deceit exposed, the council is united with the queen.  At the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], the Persians introduce their secret weapons, [[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]], who kills Sonio with a decapitating uppercut. Captain avenges him with Botox poisoning before being struck down by Xerxes. Leonidas pursues Xerxes and plays ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]''. Managing to find the "[[Spark (Transformers)|Transformer Cube]]", Xerxes uses it in a car to become [[Transformers|Xerxestron]] and shows off his powers to access the "[[Chris Crocker#"Leave Britney Alone!"|Leave Britney Alone!]]" video on [[YouTube]]. However, Xerxestron accidentally trips on his extension cord and falls on Leonidas and the surviving Spartans, apparently killing them. The blind Dilio eventually returns to Sparta to tell of Leonidas' final moments. A year later, Dilio leads a larger Spartan force to defeat the Persians, but the blind warrior ends up going the wrong way. They end up in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], where they knock [[Lindsay Lohan]] down as she is leaving [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] again.

Melancholia (2008 film)
  The film is divided into three parts, plus an epilogue, but these parts are not explicitly defined within the movie.  === Part 1 ===  The film begins with a young woman getting dressed in prostitutes clothing and walking up a long road from her apartment. She crosses paths with a nun asking for alms and gives her some money. The nun continues on her journey and runs across a pimp who confronts the nun's charity work as "useless". The prostitute befriends a woman working a small convenience shack. On her way home, the prostitute comes across the pimp, who tries to lure her to work for him. She refuses saying she can 'take care of herself'. The prostitute has dinner at a small cafe, where a large man seems to recognize her and continually pesters her by referring to her as "Alberta". After leaving the restaurant, the prostitute attempts to please an American client, but starts crying and has to end the sex session before it begins leaving the American man angry and bewildered. The next day the nun continues to ask for money and the prostitute once again meets the pimp, who tries to bring her into his business. Later in the day, the pimp sets up a "live sex show" for some Japanese customers. The prostitute comes across the large man who keeps referring to her as "Alberta". He decides to ask for her services and pays her money. However, once they get to the apartment, the large man only asks the prostitute to take off her clothes and turn around several times. He examines her body and finally decides that she is not "Alberta". He then tells her the story of his childhood friend Renato Munoz, who ended up falling for a rich girl named Alberta and they both joined the Communist rebellion movement in the Philippines and he resents Alberta for taking his friend away from him. He says Alberta was obsessed with finding Renato after he became a Communist guerrilla fighter in the forest. That night the nun undresses in her room, looking depressed. She exits her room and enters the prostitutes room right next door and tells her that she's getting fed up with the therapy. We now realize that the prostitute, who's real name is Alberta Munoz, and the nun, who is really Rina Abad, are patients of a man named Julian Tomas who is having them undergo a role-playing therapy called MELANCHOLIA to help them mentally recover from the past tragedies and losses in their lives. Rina is starting to spiral into a depression and Alberta becomes concerned. The next day, she tries frantically to call Julian (the pimp) to tell him that they need to call the therapy session off. He screams at her that he is "not Julian" and refuses to break character. He instead invites Alberta and Rina to a live sex show he has planned for them. Throughout the duration of the sex show, Alberta and Rina are visibly disturbed by Julian's immersion into his character. The next day, Rina goes missing.  === Part 2 ===  Julian engages in a bizarre therapy performance where he paces around a room smoking a cigarette while a patient continually rips pages out of a Bible and chews them until she starts to gag. Julian is at home reviewing texts and a manuscript for a book his friend has given him to publish. He invites the friend over and says he won't publish the manuscript until he gives the money he owes. The friend promises and goes on a lengthy description of what the book is about. Julian and Alberta meet for coffee and Alberta scolds Julian for his complete neglect for Rina's health. Julian admits he was wrong but refuses to admit his Melancholia therapy is an abject failure. Alberta goes to rescue Rina's abandoned daughter Hannah from prostitution and brings her back home. Alberta visits her mother who gives her dinner. Alberta then takes Hannah to the beach to have some fun and explains the friendship that her mother and Alberta shared as kids through their high school and college days. Rina is discovered to be dead and her funeral is proclaimed. Julian attends at which Rina's mother yells at him for being responsible for her daughter's death. Julian spirals into a depression, having serious thoughts about drowning himself. Alberta discovers Julian's book ''Melancholia'' in the book store and breaks down crying after reading a few pages of it.  === Part 3 ===  Renato and the Communist rebels trek through the forest trying to avoid Philippine soldiers. The further they go into the forest, the more their situation starts to eat at their sanity. Renato stays sober by writing letters to the love of his life Alberta. One of the soldiers finally loses all hope and screams in the open field near the stream for the Philippine soldiers to shoot him and take him out of his misery. Renato and the other soldier plead him to quiet down. The Philippine forces shoot and kill two of the soldiers, leaving Renato the only one left alive. He writes another letter to Alberta, saying that their sorrow will never end and is inescapable. It is assumed Renato commits suicide after this. The film cuts to a pair of indigenous tribal men carrying Renato's dead body along with the other soldiers, to their village and performing a ritual of dance and chanting.  === Epilogue ===  Julian sits solemnly by the river. Alberta meets one of the live sex show performers from earlier in the film, who has completely immersed his mind and soul into Julian's therapy. Alberta tells him that Julian is a fraud, but the performer is convinced Julian is God. He says that Julian's therapy of role-play treats the world as a stage and every individual as an actor and that since he is a performer, he is only a tool of the world Julian has created, thus making he himself Julian's creation. Alberta meets Julian once again and tells him that he is not God and that his therapy is a failure and he has to get over the death of his wife. Julian only repeats the phrase "I am not Julian" over and over again.

Las Meninas (film)
 [[File:Las Meninas. Movie Set 2.jpg|thumb|left|230px|[[Serhiy Mykhalchuk]] (DoP, left) and Ihor Podolchak. Movie set. 2006]] The film is about what the routine of everyday life can do to the human mind and psyche. It also reflects on the importance of the choices we make and how limited these choices are in the first place. The plot evolves around a family of four. They live in the suburbs, in a strange villa that appears, through a complex game of mirrors, to be more like a piece of [[installation art]] than a real house. The main character, who hardly appears on screen, is the son, a man in his thirties. Suffering from [[asthma]] and [[eczema]] since childhood, he uses his condition to manipulate his parents and his sister.  Thus the existence of the terrorized family turns into an endless ritual of attempting to satisfy his whims, and always on the alert for yet another one of his “health crises”. ''Las Meninas'' resembles the scattered pieces of a [[puzzle]]. It is up to the viewer to assemble them in order to form his very own picture – something that makes the film itself personal and unique.

The Merry Gentleman
 ''The Merry Gentleman'' is the story of Kate, a young woman who flees her abusive policeman husband, moving to Chicago.  In her new life, she befriends a co-worker but otherwise generally keeps to herself, due to her embarrassment over a black eye left over from her husband's latest attack. Most everyone she encounters is of low character, which reinforces her feelings of loneliness and reclusion.  One night, she is seen in an office window through the rifle scope of professional hit man Frank Logan, who is on the roof of the opposite building, as he prepares to shoot the occupant on another floor.  Afterwards, rather than leaving, he removes his hat and steps out on to the ledge as he apparently prepares to jump. As Kate steps out onto the sidewalk, she looks up at the falling snow and sees Frank on the ledge. She cries out, startling him into safely falling backward onto the roof.  She decides to bring a small bit of joy to her life by buying a Christmas tree. Later that night, she encounters Frank at her apartment building.  She doesn't recognize him as the man on the roof, and he helps her carry the big Christmas tree to her apartment.  He later returns to meet with her, but collapses from pneumonia before he can reveal why he's there.  Kate rushes him to the hospital, and despite the awkwardness of their conversation there, they develop a friendship that has hints of romance. Some time after his release, she mentions the old hat that he wears and wonders about "the things it has seen," unknowingly referring to the many men that Frank has murdered. Meanwhile, Kate also becomes the romantic interest of Murcheson, the detective investigating Frank's latest murder.  Murcheson asks Kate out to dinner, but she mistakes the date for a meeting about the investigation, and cuts the date short when she realizes Murcheson's romantic interest.  Initially, the police remain oblivious to the fact that Frank is a professional killer, due to his framing the murder on another man, who he then killed in a manner to make the police suspect suicide.  However, complications arrive when Kate's husband, Det. Michael Elkhart, tracks her down and breaks into her apartment.  Michael swears he has become a safe and spiritual man, but the encounter leaves Kate badly shaken.  She turns to Murcheson for help, but before he can intervene, Frank fatally shoots Michael in his motel room and makes it look like a suicide.  The police begin to suspect that Frank may be behind all three deaths.  Murcheson asks Kate out on a second date, which she reluctantly accepts. The date turns horribly awkward, however, when he reveals that he suspects Frank to be a killer. Feeling guilty about her dead husband and disturbed by Murcheson's suspicions, she visits a church. Frank finds her there, but she is not comforted by his promise never to hurt her.  Frank leaves the church and quietly walks out of her life, choosing not to subject her to the fear of knowing a professional killer.  The exact details of Frank's departure remain ambiguous. Apparently considering suicide, he drives to a high bridge over a forest and tosses his hat into the river far below. Then another car arrives and a man comes out. We later see Frank retrieve his hat from the water. Unsatisfied with his dreary day job as a tailor, having left behind the only pleasant aspect of his life, and placing the familiar symbol of his sinister side back on his head, he walks off into the woods.

Madhav and Janaradhan who are always in search of a bride for Madhav forever land up in trouble and Gaurav always has to bail them out and face embarrassment.

Gaurav and Shikha embark upon a rib-tickling journey to arrange his father's and her guardian's love marriage and, in the process, find soul mates in each other. Although the path is not so smooth; with obstacles, Madhav's desperate desire for a bride comes in handy.  However, Shikha's father ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]), seemingly not pleased with the fact that his daughter will be marrying into a family 'where the father in law is arranging his own honeymoon', threatens the termination of Gaurav's relationship with Shikha. In addition, Chirag's wife ([[Manyata Dutt|Manyata]] [[Manyata Dutt|Dutt]]) and her family also show their anger at such a relationship.

Mesrine (2008 film)
  ===Part 1===  Part 1 depicts Mesrine's life from 1959 to 1972, beginning with his time as a member of the French Army during the [[Algerian War]], where he was forced to shoot and kill prisoners and bomb-makers. On his return to France, he moves into his parents' home, where he reunites with his mother and his father. After an argument about getting an honest job, he meets with his old childhood friend, Paul, who is wealthy now and drives a sports car. They soon get into robbery business with Paul's boss, Guido, and from him, he obtains a [[Citroën DS]] as a loan. Later, Guido and Mesrine kill Ahmed, an Arab pimp who beat up Sarah (one of his girls and Mesrine's girlfriend), and bury him in the countryside and drive off.  Using Guido's status as a local crime boss as protection from their enemies, after committing some robberies, Paul and Mesrine briefly leave [[France]] for the [[Canary Islands]], where Mesrine meets and falls in love with Sofia, who moves to France with him, and they marry. However, although they have a daughter, and later two sons, Mesrine continues to be in the robbery business, causing him to get arrested and sent to prison in late 1960. He is released in 1962, and although tries to keep a steady job and be honest, he is fired over financial crisis, and dreams of easy money get him back into 'the business'. One night, Guido and Paul arrive and Mesrine prepares to leave with them, but Sofia yells at him and tells him that she will call the police, on which Mesrine snaps, slaps her, drags her across the stairs, and shoves a gun into her mouth and threatens her in front of Guido and Paul before departing. Later they divorce, leaving him custody of the children.  In 1966, Mesrine, now a gangster, goes into a bar. A woman named Jeanne Schneider comes on to him and the pair quickly fall in love. Jeanne is cut from the same cloth as Mesrine and the pair begin to commit robberies together. After stealing from a mob operated casino, the pair attract the attention of local mob bosses. In 1968, while walking with his young daughter, several men pull a 'drive-by' on Mesrine, wounding him. Guido treats him for his injuries, and suggests that he should leave the country until the things cool down, to which Mesrine agrees. He packs, leaves his kids in custody of his parents, and departs from France, traveling to [[Canada]] with Jeanne.  Later, in [[Montreal]], he works as a construction worker on the [[Champlain Bridge, Montreal|Champlain Bridge]], where he meets a Quebec resident, Jean-Paul Mercier, and they become friends. Mesrine is denied residency in Canada due to his criminal past but he remains there illegally. He and Jeanne hatch a plan to kidnap and hold a French-Canadian billionaire, a decrepit man paralyzed from the waist down. They gain access to his home by taking the jobs of a maid and a chauffeur. After several months, they put their plan into practice, kidnapping the man and spiriting him away to a flat in the city. While Jeanne and Mesrine are away to try and collect the ransom money, the man manages to crawl to the balcony, break the glass, and call for help. The billionaire is taken away by paramedics just as Mesrine and Jeanne arrive back at their apartment. They flee, escaping across the border to the United States. They are subsequently captured in the [[Arizona]] desert, while at about the same time, Guido and Paul are murdered back in France by an unknown assailant.  Mesrine and Jeanne are sent back to Canada, where Jeanne is sentenced to five years, and Mesrine is sentenced to 10 years. He is sent to the [[Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Quebec|Saint-Vincent-de-Paul]] prison, where he is exposed to extreme torture and pain. Nevertheless, he still plans to break out of prison. After reuniting with Jean-Paul, also held in the same prison, he meets Roger André, another prisoner, who helps him and Jean-Paul escape through the fence on a Monday, when the guards in the watch towers are hung over from the weekend. Soon after, they arrive near the border, where Jean-Paul meets Sylvie Jeanjacqout, and he falls in love with her. They hatch a plan to break Roger and friends out of prison, which does not go as intended. While Mesrine and Mercier are mounting the assault on the prison, they are both wounded. Roger is shot and killed.  Later Mesrine manages to call Jeanne, to tell her he plans to break her out of prison, but, fearful for them both and wanting to abandon her old life of crime, with the prison weakening her, she severs her ties to him. Mesrine and Jean-Paul continue on with the robberies, and while having target practice in the woods one day, they are caught by two forest rangers, and forced to kill them and leave them. Mesrine says to Jean-Paul, "If they catch us now, we'll hang."  The end credits roll. Notation concludes that Jeanne was released after serving her sentence, and went back to France to live freely, while Jean-Paul split with Mesrine and was shot dead a year later while robbing a bank. Mesrine's story is 'to be continued' (in part two).  ===Part 2===  The second film is about Mesrine's life from 1972 until 2 November 1979, the day of his death. The story starts back in 1972, with Mesrine returning to France after departing from Canada. He is now with Sylvie, who becomes his new girlfriend. He returns to [[Paris]] and commits more robberies. However, in March 1973, he is arrested after a successful heist, but as he is transferred to the courtroom, he requests to use the bathroom, and retrieves a pistol hidden in the toilet tank. He brandishes the gun in the court, forces the guards to uncuff him, and takes a judge hostage temporarily, while his apprentice, Michel, awaits, and the duo escapes. He returns to robberies with Michel, but his reckless behaviour (including robbing two banks at the same time) causes Michel to abandon Mesrine. After two months, French intelligence locates Mesrine's apartment, and Commissioner Broussard negotiates with Mesrine, who surrenders. He is brought to court and sentenced to 20 years in [[La Santé Prison]].  During his time in prison, he reunites with his daughter, after 12 years of absence, and she is also present when he pleads his case in court. He then writes a book about his life, which angers his lawyer, who states that his biography places him in a difficult position, since he confesses to everything in public, but he rebuffs it. He also meets François Besse, another convict and his solitary confinement neighbour, and hatches an escape plan; Besse smuggles pepper spray through a cookie box in prison (which can pass through the detectors since it's covered in aluminum foil), while Mesrine meets with his lawyer, who smuggles dual handguns in her briefcase. Mesrine informs the guard to bring his case file from Besse's cell and Besse attacks and subdues the guards with the spray, Mesrine then attacking them as well. They take their uniforms, take another prisoner as a cover and head over the wall, where the prisoner is shot while trying to escape with them. They manage to get away.  After several other robberies, Mesrine fools the media, calling himself "a revolutionary", and professing to bring Palestinian armed forces to slay the French government. This angers Besse, and he leaves him. A year later, in 1979, Mesrine is living a wealthy life and buys himself a [[BMW New Class|1974 BMW]], and contacts his old friend from prison, Charlie Bauer, and they also start a series of robberies. Mesrine becomes more and more dillusioned with the media, secretly meeting with reporters and giving controversial interviews. He also kidnaps a local billionaire, Henri Lelièvre, and holds him for ransom, and then sets him free after being paid. Sylvie is more and more worried about Mesrine, and convinces him to leave the country. Meanwhile, Mesrine kidnaps Jacques Tillier, who wrote an article about him that he doesn't like, and makes him strip naked, then beats him and shoots him, presuming him dead. Mesrine finds out the next day that Tillier survived the ordeal.  On 2 November 1979, Mesrine and Sylvie leave their apartment disguised, with Sylvie taking her poodle, but Broussard's men are after them. After checking the area, Mesrine and Sylvie arrive at their car and drive off. Broussard is stuck in traffic and runs after them. At an intersection, a truck blocks Mesrine's way, and the back tarp is thrown open, revealing armed police gunmen, who immediately open fire and shoot him dead.

Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet!
 Adjeng ([[Titi Rajo Bintang]]) lives alone in an apartment paid for by her boyfriend, a rich businessman ([[Joko Anwar]]). A writer of children's stories, she wishes to write short stories for adults; in this, she is mentored by Asmoro (Ray Sahetapy)&nbsp;– with whom she is also having sex. Meanwhile, Adjeng's mother (Henidar Amroe) handles various aspects of her life, constantly calling her and making surprise visits. This has led Adjeng's friends, Venny (Ayu Dewi) and Andien (Fairuz Faisal), to tease her about her overbearing mother.  When Adjeng goes clubbing with her friends, she drinks too much and vomits, later passing out in a toilet. As she lies with her head on the seat she recalls that, as a child (Nadya Romples), she had been forced to eat vegetables she had previously vomited. Later, when Andien uses her apartment for a [[one-night stand]], Adjeng peeks and recalls how she had observed her mother having sex with her lover ([[Bucek Depp]]), a man who had previously [[Child sexual abuse|molested]] Adjeng&nbsp;– an act which is not shown explicitly. This background, as well as her recollections of life as a teenager (played by Banyu Bening) at the home of her womanising father ([[August Melasz]]) are worked into Adjeng's short story "Lintah" ("Leech").  When Asmoro reads the story, he says that it is unrealistic and that readers need a [[Climax (narrative)|climax]]. However, Adjeng insists that reality is unrealistic and that not all victims of rape are willing to call the police. Several days later, while they are lying in bed, Asmoro shows Adjeng that "Lintah" had been published in ''[[Kompas]]''. Adjeng's mother, aware of the story's [[autobiography|autobiographical]] nature, is furious and, after going to Adjeng's apartment, blames everything on Adjeng's father abandoning them.  Upset, Adjeng goes out with Venny and Andien, but when the two begin arguing about motherhood Adjeng leaves them both in the street. She then goes to a café to drink with Asmoro, who comforts her. When she returns home she checks her messages, most of which are about the short story. Venny and Andien, meanwhile, return to their families and think of the importance of children.  The following day, Asmoro sees the businessman, Adjeng's boyfriend, leaving her apartment, which puts him in a foul mood. He and Adjeng fight, and Asmoro almost smothers Adjeng with a pillow before saying that they are through. As Adjeng lies on the bed, she recalls how her mother's lover raped her and how her mother murdered him. As the phone rings, Adjeng watches the people from her past going about life in a residential complex, smiles, and returns to writing.

The Midnight Meat Train
 Leon is a [[vegan]] photographer who wants to capture unique, gritty shots of the city and the people who live in it. He is crushed when, instead of giving him his big break, gallery owner Susan instead criticizes him for not taking enough risks. Emboldened, he heads into the city's subway system at night, where he takes pictures of an impending sexual assault before eventually saving the woman. The next day, he discovers she has gone missing. Intrigued by the mystery, he investigates reports of similar disappearances. His investigation leads him to a butcher named Mahogany, whom he suspects has been killing subway passengers for the past three years.  Leon presents his photos to the police, but Detective Hadley disbelieves him and, instead, casts suspicion on his motives. Leon's involvement quickly turns into a dark obsession, upsetting his waitress girlfriend Maya, who is as disbelieving of his story as the police. After stalking Mahogany and barely escaping, Leon follows Mahogany onto the last subway train of the night, only to witness a bloodbath. The butcher kills several passengers and hangs their bodies on meat hooks. After a brief scuffle with Mahogany, Leon passes out on the train's floor. He awakes the next morning in a slaughterhouse with strange markings carved into his chest.  A concerned Maya and her friend Jurgis examine Leon's photos of Mahogany, leading them to the killer's apartment. After breaking into the butcher's home, Jurgis is captured, though Maya escapes with timetables that record over 100 years of murders on the subway. Maya goes to the police but finds Hadley as skeptical of her story as Leon's. When Hadley presses Maya to return the timetables, Maya demands answers. At gunpoint, Hadley directs Maya to take the midnight train to find Jurgis. Leon, unaware of Maya's involvement, heads to a hidden subway entrance in the slaughterhouse, arming himself with several slaughterhouse knives and wearing a butcher's apron.  Leon boards the train as Mahogany has completed his nightly massacre and has cornered Maya. Leon attacks the murderer with a knife, and the two fight in between the swinging human flesh. Human body parts are ripped, thrown, and used as weapons. Jurgis, hung from a meat hook, dies when he is gutted. Finally, Leon throws Mahogany out of the train. The train reaches its final stop, a cavernous abandoned station filled with skulls and decomposing bodies. The conductor steps into the car, advising Leon and Maya to "please step away from the meat." The true purpose of the abandoned station is revealed, as reptilian creatures enter the car and consume the bodies of the murdered passengers. Leon and Maya flee into the cavern. Mahogany, battered and bleeding, returns and fights to the death with Leon. After Leon stabs a broken femur through Mahogany's throat, Mahogany grins in his dying throes, saying only, "Welcome!"  The conductor appears and tells Leon the creatures have lived beneath the city since long before the subway was constructed, and the butcher's job is to feed them each night to keep them from attacking subway riders during the day. He picks up Leon, and with the same supernatural strength as the deceased butcher, rips out Leon's tongue, throwing him to the ground and eating it. The conductor brings Leon's attention to Maya, who has been knocked unconscious and is lying on a pile of bones. The conductor forces Leon to watch as he cuts Maya's chest open to remove her heart. When he is done, he tells Leon that, having killed the butcher, Leon must take his place.  Finally, Detective Hadley hands the train schedule to the new butcher, who wears a ring with the symbol of the group that feeds the creatures. The killer walks onto the midnight train and turns his head to reveal himself as Leon.

Milk (film)
 The film opens with archival footage of police raiding [[gay bar]]s and arresting patrons during the 1950s and 1960s, followed by [[Dianne Feinstein]]'s November 27, 1978 announcement to the press that [[Harvey Milk]] and Mayor [[George Moscone]] [[Moscone–Milk assassinations|had been assassinated]]. Milk is seen recording his will throughout the film, nine days (November 18, 1978) before the assassinations. The film then flashes back to New York City in 1970, the eve of Milk's 40th birthday and his first meeting with his much younger lover, [[Scott Smith (activist)|Scott Smith]].  Dissatisfied with his life and in need of a change, Milk and Smith decide to move to San Francisco in the hope of finding larger acceptance of their relationship. They open Castro Camera in the heart of [[Eureka Valley, San Francisco, California|Eureka Valley]], a [[working class|working-class]] neighborhood in the process of evolving into a predominantly [[gay village|gay neighborhood]] known as [[The Castro, San Francisco|The Castro]]. Frustrated by the opposition they encounter in the once Irish-Catholic neighborhood, Milk utilizes his background as a businessman to become a [[Gay activism|gay activist]], eventually becoming a mentor for [[Cleve Jones]]. Early on, Smith serves as Milk's campaign manager, but he grows frustrated with Milk's devotion to politics, and he leaves him. Milk later meets Jack Lira, a sweet-natured but unbalanced young man. As with Smith, Lira cannot tolerate Milk's devotion to political activism, and eventually hangs himself. Milk clashes with the local gay "establishment" which he feels to be too cautious and risk-averse.  After two unsuccessful political campaigns in 1973 and 1975 to become a city supervisor and a third in 1976 for the [[California State Assembly]], Milk finally wins a seat on the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] in 1977 for District 5. His victory makes him the first openly gay man to be voted into major public office in California and the third openly homosexual politician in the entire US. Milk subsequently meets fellow Supervisor Dan White, a Vietnam veteran and former police officer and firefighter. White, who is politically and socially [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], has a difficult relationship with Milk, and develops a growing resentment for Milk when he opposes projects that White proposes.  Milk and White forge a complex working relationship. Milk is invited to, and attends, the christening of White's first child, and White asks for Milk's assistance in preventing a [[psychiatric hospital]] from opening in White's district, possibly in exchange for White's support of Milk's citywide gay rights ordinance. When Milk fails to support White because of the negative effect it will have on troubled youth, White feels betrayed, and ultimately becomes the sole vote against the gay rights ordinance. Milk also launches an effort to defeat [[Briggs Initiative|Proposition 6]], an [[initiative]] on the California state ballot in November 1978. Sponsored by [[John Briggs (politician)|John Briggs]], a conservative state legislator from [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], Proposition 6 seeks to ban gays and lesbians (in addition to anyone who supports them) from working in California's public schools. It is also part of a nationwide conservative movement that starts with the successful campaign headed by [[Anita Bryant]] and her organization [[Save Our Children]] in [[Dade County, Florida]] to repeal a local gay rights ordinance.  On November 7, 1978, after working tirelessly against Proposition 6, Milk and his supporters rejoice in the wake of its defeat. A desperate White favors a supervisor pay raise, but does not get much support, and shortly after supporting the proposition, resigns from the Board. He later changes his mind and asks to be reinstated. Mayor Moscone denies his request, after being lobbied by Milk.  On the morning of November 27, 1978, White enters [[San Francisco City Hall|City Hall]] through a basement window to conceal a gun from metal detectors. He requests another meeting with Moscone, who rebuffs his request for appointment to his former seat. Enraged, White shoots Moscone in his office and then goes to meet Milk, where he guns him down, with the fatal bullet delivered execution-style. The film suggests that Milk believed that White might be a [[closeted]] gay man.<ref>Edelstein D.

Accessed on: January 3, 2009.</ref>  The last scene is a [[candlelight vigil]] held by thousands for Milk and Moscone throughout the streets of the city. Pictures of the actual people depicted in the film, and brief summaries of their lives follow.

 Forty years after directing and starring in a [[Slasher film|slasher movie]], entitled ''The Dark Beneath'', centred on a group of friends being killed by a masked killer, Ted Radford ([[Arthur Roberts (actor)|Arthur Roberts]]) suffers a [[mental breakdown]] and is admitted to a psychiatric ward. In an attempt to cure Radford, his doctor (Richard Magarey) shows him the movie, despite the warnings of Dr. Wayne ([[Michael Swan]]). When Dr. Wayne arrives at the ward the following morning, he discovers evidence of a [[Mass murder|mass slaughter]], however no bodies are to be found.  Five years later, a local theater is showing ''The Dark Beneath'' for the first time since the murders.

Bridget's younger brother Timmy (Justin Baric) also arrives, but is sent home due to his age. As the movie is about to begin, Josh convinces Bridget to allow Kenny to be in charge so she can watch the movie with him.  However, after a while Bridget becomes unsettled by the movie and enters the lobby, where it is revealed she was abused by her father as a child. At this time, Kenny enters the basement to retrieve stock, but is attacked by the same killer from the movie, and is ultimately stabbed to death with a large [[corkscrew]]. His death is shown to the watchers in the theater, however they continue to believe it is part of the movie. Meanwhile, Josh convinces Bridget to enter the theater once again, while Sully goes to use the restroom. However, while returning he is too attacked and has his heart gored out. Bridget, Josh, Mario and Samantha think of it as an elaborate prank by Sully, but Rachael too is stabbed to death for all to see, prompting everyone to investigate. The detective reveals himself to the rest of the group, who realize the deaths are real. The group try to get help, but find their phones do not have a signal and the theater's phone is dead. They also discover Timmy, who had snuck back in to watch the movie. Suddenly, Radford appears and slashes Dr. Wayne's throat. The detective shoots Radford, but there is little effect as Dr. Wayne is soon seen being dragged into a basement on the screen.  Timmy tells the group he snuck in through the upstairs window, and so the group decide to try and escape. However, while doing so the window slams shut on Samantha's fingers, trapping her and forcing the others to flee. The Detective attempts to save Samantha, however Radford stabs both to death. Regrouping downstairs, the survivors find a police officer outside the front entrance, however Radford makes the group unable to be seen, and the police officer soon leaves. Desperate, the group resort to trying to break the projector, and thus stop the movie. However, the door is locked, and so Timmy enters the ventilation system. He makes it to the room and lets the others in, where Harley breaks the projector just in time to save Josh who is attacked by Radford. The projector quickly repairs itself, and Radford re-appears and chases the group. Harley, Babe and Timmy hide in a closet but the killer breaks through the door and stabs Harley in the stomach with the corkscrew, while the others get away.  Bridget, Josh and Mario make their way back to the theater where they witness Babe being stabbed to death on the screen. Mario ditches his friends, but is eventually electrocuted to death by Radford. Josh also falls victim to Radford, while Bridget finds Timmy. Bridget realizes that in order to defeat the killer they have to get rid of their fear.  Together, the pair concentrate on not being afraid and Radford is unable to kill them.  Suddenly, Bridget finds herself in the movie, in a creepy basement. She explores and finds everyone Radford has killed tied up in cells, bleeding but not dead.  She finds Josh who tells her she has to leave but Radford finds and recaptures her, torturing her by breaking off her toes, until once again she is able to ignore her fear and escapes and frees Timmy. They are ambushed by the killer's movie mother, but Timmy stabs her in the back with a [[sickle]] and once again they continue their escape, with Radford chasing them. Bridget realises the movie is coming to an end, and so sacrifices herself to remain trapped in the movie world, throwing Timmy through the screen back into the real world, in order to save him.  The police arrive at the theater to find Timmy the only survivor.  A post credits sequence shows a policeman giving a ticket to the dead biker's vehicle.

Five Al Johara reports before Uwais had either died in a car bomb explosion, abducted and killed or simply found dead.

Alexandra is the daughter of a rich man who is funding Zach's latest documentary; she is also the reason why Georgina was unable to speak to Zach before he left for a trip.  On day two, Georgina goes to a funeral to pick up a man overcome with "emotions" and isn't thinking too well. She takes him back to her apartment, leaves to get wine and as she is in the kitchen he discovers her "PLAN" sheet that has all the details about her seducing him on it.  He is disgusted and leaves, as Georgina tries to explain herself.  Day three, Georgina finds herself with Clem at a night club. They see a very good looking young man, dancing very seductively and attracting all the girls' attention, and Georgina goes to seduce him. Before successfully seducing the man, she rips her dress in several places to make herself more sultry.  At the hotel, Georgina is about to go all the way with him, before she excuses herself to go to the bathroom. While she is taking out her breast pads and washing her mouth out, he steals some of her money and a card before leaving.  Georgina comes out to find the lights off and him gone. After cursing her stupidity – and noticing her money and card gone – she goes home.  During this time, Zach is seen trying to hurry back to London and has to take the ferry because Alexandra had taken the last ticket going to London. Georgina and Clem purchase sperm from the Internet and go out to buy a turkey baster.  At this time, Georgia reveals to Clem that she only wants Zach, before she says that she can't believe that the future father of her child is a turkey baster.  Georgina, seeming desperate at this point, turns to one of her employees who reveals that he is infertile just before the two of them can have sex.  She then plans to go through with the artificial insemination, reading the directions as the sperm arrives.  Her mother arrives with a birthday cake and Georgina accidentally squirts the sperm on the cake. Clem intends Justin, her so-called pet, to impregnate Georgina. A nervous Justin doesn't seem to want to go through with it. They go to a hotel room and Justin can't seem to get off, nor is he comfortable with this idea. Justin can't do it and backs out.  She begins to spank him, before she is thrown out of the hotel by the staff. She runs into a friend of Zach's and is comforted by him.  While hugging him, Zach walks in and assumes that they are having an affair and slaps his friend before leaving. Georgina runs after him, but loses him. She misses her chance to get pregnant and mopes around because she lost both her chance to have a baby and Zach.  Ben, Zach's friend, comes over to check on Georgina and the two begin to talk about how awkward the situation was just as the doorbell rings. Clem gets it and turns out that it's Zach, who is outraged to find Ben and Georgina holding hands. He slaps Ben again, who, in turn, punches Zach. The two have a scuffle, during which Ben tells Zach that while Georgia is OK, she isn't Clem.  Clem, hearing this, asks him to repeat that and after establishing that he likes Clem and not Georgina, he gets off Zach and goes to Clem.  Georgina asks about Alexandra, who Zach admits is beautiful, but says that isn't all he looks for in a person. She isn't impressed by his reasoning, however Zach continues on trying to explain that he loves her and had never stopped.  Zach reveals that he wants children too, however an upset Georgina leaves and Ben has to explain to Zach what had been going on.  At work, Georgina's worker reveals that he understands why she left and leaves before Zach comes in with a dozen roses.  Four months later, while Georgina is running her breasts and belly feel sore and goes to a clinic for a pregnancy test. She receives a call informing her that she is, in fact, pregnant. At a birthday party for Zach, it is revealed that they are engaged and Georgina tells him that she’s pregnant. Zach is overjoyed about the news.  
Mirrors (film)
 A security guard runs through a subway station until he enters a room he cannot escape and starts begging his reflection in a mirror for his life. His reflection uses a shard to slice into its own throat; the wound reflects upon the real security guard's body, killing him.  Ben Carson ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]), a suspended police detective, begins his first day as a night security guard at the Mayflower, a luxury department store that was gutted by a fire and shuttered five years prior. The building still contains numerous mirrors from the store.  On Ben's first night of patrol, he finds a mirror that appears to be covered with handprints, but only on the reflected side of the glass. He sees an open door in the reflection while it is actually closed. Over time, Ben begins to see more intense visions, which he initially shrugs off as hallucinations. He soon finds the wallet of Gary Lewis, the previous night guard (from the beginning of the film) who supposedly killed himself. Inside is a note that says "Esseker". After noticing the absence of blood on the mirror shard in Gary’s crime photos, Ben is convinced that the mirrors make people do things to themselves that they are not actually doing.  Meanwhile, Ben's sister, Angie ([[Amy Smart]]) is killed by her reflection as it grips its jaw and slowly pulls its mouth apart, causing her to bleed profusely. Ben is distraught when he finds her body. In anger, he attempts to destroy the mirrors at the Mayflower, but they are impervious to damage. He demands to know what the mirrors want, and cracks appear on one of the mirrors, spelling out the word "ESSEKER".  Ben enters the flooded basement of the Mayflower and finds a small sign stating "Psychiatric Studies" and "St. Matthew's Hospital" underneath. He moves to the site of the leak and begins pulling at the tiles and brick of the wall and finds a room with a chair surrounded by mirrors beyond it, a [[Psychomanteum]]. Realizing that the Mayflower was built on the site of an earlier hospital, Ben asks his police friend Larry ([[Jason Flemyng]]) to help him locate the patient-employee manifest for the hospital. Larry finds the name Anna Esseker, a patient of the psychiatric hospital. She was twelve years old at the time and died in a mass suicide.  Ben looks through Anna's file and finds an Authorization and Consent form that negated her Death Certificate, stating that she had been discharged from the hospital two days before the suicide and is led to believe that Anna is still alive. Meanwhile, Ben's wife Amy ([[Paula Patton]]) discovers her son Mikey's ([[Cameron Boyce]]) reflection acting differently from the real Mikey. In a panic, she calls Ben, who immediately returns home. Together they cover every reflective surface in the house with green paint.  Ben locates Anna Esseker's childhood home, and discovers that as a child she was violent and uncontrollable, and diagnosed with severe [[schizophrenia]]. She was taken in by a doctor from St. Matthew’s Hospital, who believed that she was suffering from a rare personality disorder. His treatment was to confine Anna to a chair surrounded by mirrors, believing this would cure her disorder by forcing her to confront her own reflection. Ben is told by her brother that when she returned, apparently cured, strange things started to happen with the mirrors in their home. As a result, her family sent her to a convent, Saint Augustine's Monastery, where mirrors are forbidden.  Ben visits the convent and finds Anna ([[Mary Beth Peil]]), who explains that she was actually possessed by a [[demon]], which was drawn from her and became trapped in the mirrors. She explains that it collects the souls of those it kills and if she were to return it would make it possible for the demon to be brought back into the mortal world. She refuses to go back.  Meanwhile, Amy discovers that Mikey is missing at home and a thin reflective layer of water is completely covering the floor. After putting her daughter in a safe closet, she finds Mikey using a chef knife to scrape the paint from the mirrors. Amy tries to stop him but he escapes, obviously [[Demonic possession|possessed]].  Having threatened her at gunpoint, Ben returns with Anna to the Mayflower and straps her into the chair in the Psychomanteum.  Back at Ben's house Mikey is suddenly pulled through the water on the floor by his reflection and begins to drown. At the Psychomanteum the lights begin to flicker and the building begins to shake as the demons in the mirrors are released. They repossess Anna and all the mirrors in the Mayflower explode. Simultaneously, Mikey is released from the demon's grip and Amy is able to pull him to safety. Ben is then attacked by the repossessed Anna. He manages to kill her by igniting a nearby gas line, setting off a huge explosion. The old building collapses, killing the demon, and trapping Ben under the ceiling as he rushes toward the exit.  Ben pulls himself out of the rubble and stumbles out of the building. Policemen and firemen are everywhere in the street, and a body is seen being taken in a bag by paramedics, but nobody notices Ben. He looks at the older security guard's name tag and sees it is written backward, realizing everything is in reverse (like in a mirror). He comes upon a mirrored surface in the city and fails to see his own reflection as he reaches out to touch it. He realizes that he was actually crushed under the rubble and is now trapped in the mirror world: In the living world, his hand appears as a handprint on the glass surface.  
The Missing Lynx
 After one of his countless mishaps, Félix (''Felix'' in the English version), a clumsy and unlucky [[Iberian Lynx|Iberian lynx]], is transported to the animal recovery shelter at the [[Doñana National Park]], along with Beeea (''Beeety'' in the English version), a daredevil goat, and Astarté, a brave falcon with an injured wing. However, the national park had undergone security measures while Félix was gone. Mysterious animal kidnappings have occurred at other national parks and animal preservations, which had caused the shelter to be turned into a prison-like structure, leading Félix's paranoid chameleon friend Gus to believe that their human caretakers are in a conspiracy to keep the animals locked up for experiments. While the others are skeptical of Gus's claims, a female lynx, Lincesa (Lynxette in the English version), is brought to the shelter; she and Félix begin to form an attraction to each other.  In the dead of night, the shelter is infiltrated by mercenaries led by Newmann, the self-titled "greatest hunter in the world", hired by an eccentric millionaire, Noé (''Noah'' in the English version), who has created a sort of [[Noah's Ark]] for threatened species. Due to the antics of two bumbling mercenaries, Félix is able to escape from his cage and free his friends from the transport trucks, with the exception of Lincesa being hit with a sedative dart by Newmann. With some encouragement, Astarté is able to fly back to the shelter and set off the alarm, alerting the humans to their disappearance. Félix and his friends set out to find the kidnapped animals and stop Noé's plans, later accompanied by their mole friend Rupert, who escaped from the ship. They enlist a pack of wolves to help them evade Newmann and the pursuing mercenaries, however, the wolves are caught along with a few other animals, and Félix starts to believe that it's his bad luck to blame for them being followed. They meet Diogenes, a vulture with a mission to clean the environment, who supplies the group with materials to build a makeshift transport to outrun the mercenaries. However, Félix abandons the group to protect them from his bad luck.  On Noé's ship, Lincesa discovers that Noé has the ability to speak with animals. He tells her that he was once locked up in an insane asylum for claiming to talk with animals, but after being released, he used his communication skills to amass a large fortune (e.g., horses at the racetrack, moles finding oil pockets underground, fish guiding him to sunken treasure). His plan is to collect endangered animals and bring them to an island refuge is his way of thanking them by saving them from extinction, as thanks to them for helping build his fortune. "What's the point in being free if you're not alive?", he tells Lincesa. However, she turns his words on him saying, "What's the point in being alive if you're not free?" After hearing this and being reminded of how terrible it was for him to be locked up, Noé becomes disillusioned with his plan.  After Félix finds Rupert, who had mysteriously disappeared, it turns out that Rupert is responsible for Newmann and the mercenaries tracking them. After the events at the animal center, Noé implanted Rupert with a microchip and set him free in hopes of finding the escaped animals, in exchange for the safety of Rupert's family (moles aren't endangered, after all). Realizing that it's not his bad luck to blame, Félix returns to his friends in time to save them from being caught by Newmann. The hunter underestimates Félix, and this results in him being scratched in the face by the lynx. He becomes mad with rage at this, and attempts to fire a lethal shot at Félix, but is interrupted by a call from Noé, telling him to call off the hunt immediately. Further enraged, Newmann decides to take over the ship, lock Noé in a cage, and set up traps in the ship's hanger for Félix.  While Gus and Beeea free Noé from his cage, Newmann tries to draw Félix to him using Lincesa as bait. Unexpectedly, Newmann causes an explosion that starts to flood the ship, beginning an evacuation protocol of the caged animals. While fighting Newmann, Félix has an epiphany that by holding on to the hunter, he will be prone to injury by his own traps, thanks to Félix's bad luck. This leads to Newmann seemingly crushed to death by a large trap. Félix, Lincesa, the animals, and Noé make it to safety in life rafts.  Afterwards, Felix and Lincesa have a cub, and have Gus present it to the other animals (à la [[The Lion King|Lion King]]). The film ends with the two incompetent mercenaries, now working for the shelter, arguing over whether they have seen the lynx before.  In a [[post-credits scene]], it is shown that Newmann actually survived his encounter at the ship, but now has a fear of cats.

Monster X Strikes Back: Attack the G8 Summit
 In the year 2008 all the world leaders are together at a [[G8 Summit]] meeting in Japan. A meteorite crashes into the heart of [[Sapporo]] and releases the monster [[The X from Outer Space|Guilala]]. The monster rampages through Sapporo, leaving death and destruction in his wake. After leveling the city, Guilala transforms into a giant ball of fire and flies to [[Hokkaidō]], making its way to the [[G8 Summit]]. The Prime Minister of Japan proposes cancelling the Summit for the safety of all involved, but the [[President of the United States]] convinces the other world leaders to personally stay and fight. Shortly after forming a world alliance, each leader stays to fight for their own reason:  *[[United States]] - To boost his ratings in the polls. *[[France]] - To make a move on a pretty Japanese interpreter. *[[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] - To assist their "allies," the United States. *[[Germany]] - To put an end to sexism by the German [[Bundestag|Parliament]]. *[[Canada]] - To accompany the German leader for her safety. *[[Italy]] - Believes that Ancient Roman philosophies will stop Guilala. *[[Russia]] - Feels left out by the group and because Russia is close to Japan (where Guilala might head for next.) *[[Japan]] - Joins the group majority agreeing to stop Guilala.  The leaders soon discover the reason for Guilala's appearance on Earth was due to a [[China|Chinese]] satellite that fell out of orbit and was the crashed "meteorite" in Sapporo. Assisting the leaders is Dr. Sano, a Japanese scientist who discovers that Guilala is actually a cosmic spore attached to the Probe that was exposed to the Earth's atmosphere, causing it to grow into the monster. He also figures out that the crash caused Guilala to lose a lot of energy and it is searching for "high temperature" energy to recharge. The doctor does not think the monster will leave Japan until it finds the energy it needs. Meanwhile, Guilala arrives at the [[Noboribetsu, Hokkaidō|Noboribetsu]] Power Planet and sucks all of the energy out of the plant.  Hoping to trap Guilala, the Japanese set up an earthquake generator near "Mt. Showa" to draw Guilala to a magma flow and destroy him with a super missile known as "The Vulture". Guilala arrives to feed, but he swallows the missile whole when it is fired at him. Soon, other countries are scrambling with their own "super" weapons, but each one fails in comedic fashion. In the middle of all this the Japanese Prime Minister is waylaid by [[diarrhea]] and is replaced by Junzaburo Ohizumi, a former Prime Minister and a friend of the US President. He arrives to help in the battle, but seems shifty. Ohizumi even suggests using nuclear weapons, but is stared down by the other leaders.  When Guilala's mind is damaged by a British brainwashing weapon, the monster begins a wild rampage. Ohizumi suddenly reveals that he is in fact the leader of the "North Country" (North Korea's Kim Jong-Il). He stole Ohizumi's identity during a state visit. He reveals that the Japanese interpreters attending the G8 Summit are all his spies and they all draw weapons, taking the world leaders hostage. He also announces that he plans on using a "limited" nuclear warhead to destroy Guilala. Meanwhile, President Sorkozy (sic) of France has finally bedded the translator, who confesses her true identity. Clad only in a towel, Sorkozy creates a distraction, which allows Japanese soldiers to rush the spies. The North Country leader is captured but not before managing to launch the nuclear missile at Guilala. Dr. Sano announces that Guilala's spores are re-energized and that if the missile strikes it will spread Guilala spores worldwide...  ===Subplot=== Two Japanese journalists named Sumire Sumidagawa and Sanpei Toyama discover a hidden village full of worshipers. They are driven out as outsiders intruding on a sacred ceremony. Shortly afterward Guilala lands and begins searching for energy. Sumire and Sanpei are sent to get news on Guilala's rampage. However, their efforts prove unsuccessful as other news groups are looking for big news on Guilala. During the G8 Summit's efforts to stop Guilala, Sumire encounters a boy she saw at the village's ceremony. Believing that the village might know how to stop Guilala, Sumire and Sanpei return for answers.  They find a carving of Guilala which they also notice is battling another monster. That figure is known as "''Take-Majin''," a deity the villagers worship. An ancient prophecy predicted that Guilala was going to destroy the world, but he would be stopped by Take-Majin, who would awaken to save mankind from Guilala. The little boy Sumire met earlier worshiped Take-Majin, after his father was killed in a landslide. Concerned with the planet's safety over their own, Sumire and a reluctant Sanpei participate in Take-Majin's awakening ceremony. Just when Take-Majin is about to wake up, the entire village is evacuated by the army when a nuclear missile is fired at Guilala.  But Take-Majin suddenly awakens and stops the missile by catching it with his buttocks, allowing it to explode inside of him. He then confronts Guilala, preparing for battle. After a long battle Take-Majin is victorious, decapitating Guilala, saving all humanity as prophesied. Take-Majin then returns back into his shrine to sleep once again. The G8 Summit leaders celebrate their victory by taking a bath in a hot spring (despite the leader of the North Country escaping during the fight).  
Money No Enough 2

At the persuasion of his youngest brother, he strikes out as an entrepreneur to sell health supplements. As business improves, Bao Hui quits his dead-end job and puts all his time into the business. Unfortunately the business is forced to a standstill when the health supplement is deemed unsafe for public consumption, which inadvertently brings Bao Hui close to financial ruin.  The second brother Yang Bao Qiang (by Jack Neo) portrays a well-heeled successful businessman.

When the health supplement business goes bust, debts pile up and Bao Huang too, faces financial ruin.

Coincidentally, the same type of blood was required to save both granddaughter and grandmother. The hospital so happened to have only one bag of the required blood, which a scuffle happens between everyone to decide who gets the treatment first.  Knowing the situation, the brother's mother overhears the commotion and sacrifices herself, to save her granddaughter, a younger generation whom she feels deserved to live more than herself as her time already drew near.  Much later, Bao Huang's wife is released, and the entire family is more well-off as they strike first place in a lottery draw. They give offerings to their mother, thinking that she helped them financially for all her life, whether deceased or living.  The film ends as the entire family enjoys their new start of life and the three brothers learn of their lesson.  ===Mini-sequel=== A mini-sequel was filmed and featured in the omnibus horror movie by Jack Neo, [[Where Got Ghost?]].  It is the [[Hungry Ghost Festival|Seventh Lunar Month]] and three brothers - Bao Qiang, Bao Huang and Bao Hui - all pay respects to their deceased mother. They complain bitterly to their mother that they are doing poorly financially, and that their mother is not assisting them supernaturally. Soon afterwards, however, strange things begin to happen at their homes. The brothers all claim to see or hear their mother on numerous occasions. After hearing that parents dying in the night will bring bad luck to their children, Bao Qiang and Bao Huang overrule Bao Hui and urge him to bring their mother's remains to a temple.  Bao Hui attempts to bring their mother's urn and tablet to a temple, but is shocked to find it reappearing in his car later. He immediately calls his brothers to accompany him, but they think he is overreacting.  During a car journey from [[Malaysia]], the ghostly apparition of their mother suddenly appears on the road before them, causing Bao Huang to swerve and nearly crash off a cliff.

Monster (2008 film)
  The film takes place in [[Tokyo]] in 2003, where two reporters, Erin and Sarah Lynch, have arrived to document unusual seismic disturbances that have been picked up around Tokyo. The disturbances are originally thought to be aftershocks left over from a supposed massive earthquake on the Kanto Fault that occurred two years previously, causing hundreds of thousands of casualties and several hundred billion dollars in damage(possibly referencing the real-life [[2005 Fukuoka earthquake|Fukuoka earthquake]] or the [[2005 Miyagi earthquake|Miyagi earthquake]]), although careful analysis of the evidence suggests otherwise.  As time goes on, all of Tokyo begins to suffer from abnormal earth tremors similar to those registered in 2005. The tremors are found not to be caused by an earthquake, but by a gigantic octopus that has been dormant for centuries. It has since been awakened by mankind and now sees Tokyo as a new feeding-ground; the filmmakers document the catastrophe as it unfolds.  It starts as Erin and Sarah are talking about filming Tokyo. The scene then switches to the interior of Erin's car as the two drive to [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]], to catch their flight to Tokyo. In Tokyo they rent a hotel room, and, the next day, Sarah films Erin talking with the [[global warming]] minister. During the interview, an earthquake strikes and the scene again switches to the reporters in the basement of the environmental building. They find a survivor named Justin Robbins, and as they flee, they hear the sounds of panic and plane engines from a tunnel.  Later, they find a mall, and another earthquake occurs. In the chaos, Justin is impaled by a pole as the reporters flee in panic. Some small text appears on the screen saying that tape #3 was damaged. As the reporters run toward a mall they find a woman (Aiko) and her grandfather, and they eat and sleep, Erin not realizing she had left the camera turned on. Then, another earthquake begins and kills the grandfather as the woman tells the reporters to flee. They hear the mall explode as they run away and soon find a building which they enter. They have gone upstairs when the building suddenly collapses. The reporters survive, but the collapse damages the camera lens.  Night arrives and they see helicopters ready to save refugees, but a tentacle destroys them and proceeds to throw cars at the people, killing many of them. Panic ensues, and Sarah abandons Erin. A tentacle slams into the ground where Erin is and she is wounded. Additionally, the camera's batteries run low. Sarah cries for Erin as the crash of a tentacle hitting the ground is heard, ending the film, which indicates that the reporters were crushed by the monster and were among the thousands, if not millions, killed.

A Month of Hungry Ghosts
 In parts of Asia each year, during the seventh lunar month, it is believed that the gates of [[Hell]] are opened and all the souls are set free to wander the [[Earth]].  At this time, many [[spirit]]s roam around trying to fulfill their past needs, wants and desires.  These are the "[[hungry ghost]]s". Numerous religious rituals and folk performances, like street operas, take place during the seventh lunar month to try to appease the spirits.  This film captures the seventh-lunar-month rituals in Singapore, a world-class centre of business and culture inhabited by many different immigrants from other Asian countries.  While the hungry-ghost rituals originated in China and are still practised throughout [[South-east Asia]] in various forms, they are slowly dying out in many countries or may only be performed for several days of the month.  Singapore is unique in that the rituals are brought to life throughout the entire seventh lunar month. At the same time, the immigrants in Singapore have brought their own native rituals to the small island nation where the hungry-ghost month still thrives. ''A Month of Hungry Ghosts'' captures these rituals and performances throughout an entire seventh lunar month in Singapore.

Lena then falls and then Mum stabs her with a knife she took from the house. But Mum and Dad are too weak to kill her so Lena fights them off, and stabs them both repeatedly back and forth.

Transforming into a dragon, Han kidnaps Lin and flies back to the tomb, raising his Terracota Army, planning to cross the Great Wall, where they will be invincible. The O'Connells and Zi Yuan pursue Han to the Great Wall where she sacrifices her and Lin's immortality to create an undead army from beneath The Great Wall, led by a revived General Ming. As Alex rescues Lin, Zi Yuan fights Han and is mortally wounded, but secures the dagger. Zi Yuan gives the dagger to the group before dying. Meanwhile, Han goes into the Great Wall to use his elemental powers to negate the undead spell. Rick and Alex fight off Han while Evelyn and Lin fight and kill Yang and Choi. Han gains the upper hand over Rick, but Rick and Alex manage to stab Han in his heart with the dagger, killing him and defeating the Terracotta Army. Ming's army briefly celebrates before finally moving on to a peaceful afterlife.  The O'Connells return to Shanghai while Jonathan decides to move to [[Peru]] with the Eye of Shangri-La, as he wants to go somewhere with no mummies. However, in postscript, it is revealed that upon his arrival, [[Chinchorro mummies|mummies were discovered in Peru]].

My Girlfriend Is a Cyborg
 It is 22 November 2007. Jiro Kitamura ([[Keisuke Koide]]) is spending his 20th birthday alone. As he buys a birthday present for himself in a shopping mall, he gets the attention of a 'cute girl' ([[Haruka Ayase]]) and she surprisingly smiles at him. Afterwards, she successfully steals a pair of clothes, which Jiro notices, but he ignores it as she walks away in front of him and he is distracted by her beauty. The mystery girl, who seems to be interested in him, follows him to a restaurant, where he eats spaghetti on the advice of his grandmother (later revealed to be his mother who gave birth to him in old age) for a longer and peaceful life. She suddenly appears and sits with him, stating that it's 'her birthday too'. The two of them then exchange birthday presents. The girl, who seems unused to everything, behaves very boldly and suddenly rushes with Jiro out of the restaurant without paying the bill, provoking the manager to chase the two through Tokyo. As he spends time with the girl, Jiro finds himself charmed by her. But, after a few hours, the girl insists she has to leave and goes with a tearful goodbye.  The story then jumps to one year later, as Jiro again celebrates his birthday alone in the same restaurant. All of a sudden, the same-looking girl appears in front of him. Jiro's older self from 65 years in the future had sent this girl to save him from a disastrous fate. She was actually a [[cyborg]], modelled after the girl he met a year before in 2007. While he rejoices in her presence, the restaurant is suddenly attacked by a gunman, but she saves him and the other guests by throwing the gunman out of the window. Despite her 'cute' outward appearance, she is incredibly strong and behaves erratically. Later, in Jiro's home, she reveals her true identity by showing him a 3D projection of a video in which an elderly Jiro from the future warns him about an upcoming disaster. The old Jiro told him that the shooting at the restaurant paralyzed him for life. However, a lottery ticket he bought earlier was fortunate for him. He spent all his time and money on one thing: creating the cyborg girl to save his past self about 60 years ago. Now, he has recreated the history of his timeline by sending her. This was not supposed to happen, but things would correct themselves by recalibrating to the right dimension. In a short span of time, she becomes Jiro's protector as well as a loyal friend and they both share some wonderful moments. She also saves many other lives from tragic deaths that old Jiro had regretted witnessing.  Over time, Jiro not only becomes dependent on, but also falls in love with her. However, when she cannot return his feelings, he gets irritated and forbids her from seeing him unless she can do so. He begins to regret this, especially when it becomes apparent that she is still helping him while staying out of his sight. Another disaster soon occurs: a gigantic earthquake completely devastates Tokyo. As his apartment block collapses, she appears to help him, but even her superhuman strength isn't enough to save him. After telling Jiro that she now understands his feelings, she is destroyed while saving him. Later, distraught, Jiro finds her body and spends the next 61 years trying to rebuild her. He eventually succeeds but dies shortly after.  Further in the future (63 years later) in 2133, a girl is told by her friend that there is a cyborg on display that looks just like her. She is curious, and buys the now defunct cyborg to experience the memories stored in her hard-drive. Intrigued, she then decides to fulfil her wish of going back in time to meet Jiro. She is revealed to be the actual girl who met Jiro on his 20th birthday (November 22, 2007), who did so because she wanted to meet him before the cyborg did. After the events of the story, she comes again to the moment when Jiro weeps over the destroyed body of the cyborg. She then says "I can feel his heart," and decides to live with Jiro from then on, changing his fate again.

Mutants (2008 film)
 The story of ''Mutants'' is told in a non-linear fashion. Flashbacks telling the main story are framed by pieces of a conversation between government agent Marcus Santiago ([[Steven Bauer]]) and Colonel Gauge ([[Michael Ironside]]), the leader of Shadow Rock Securities International.  At the beginning of the film, Santiago is seen briefing Gauge on his mission, which involved spying on the Just Rite Sugar Company, who are allegedly involved in some kind of plot involving an unethical Russian scientist as well as Shadow Rock Securities itself. A visibly shaken Santiago warns Gauge that Shadow Rock's leader, Colonel Briggs, is involved in the plot; however, once assured that Briggs has been detained and Gauge is now Shadow Rock's commander, he details his activities, which included planting [[wire tap]]s and spying on the operations of Just Rite. Santiago berates himself for following his orders&nbsp;– to spy but not get involved&nbsp;– too closely, as he could have stopped the plan before it progressed to its current stage, which he claims could be the extinction of humanity.  Prior to this, Just Rite security officials pursue an escaped girl, Hannah ([[Jessica Heap]]) through a seemingly abandoned mill, capturing and killing her before disposing of her body in a boiler.  Just Rite CEO Braylon (Richard Zeringue) meets with his security commander, Sykes (Tony Senzamici) who informs him of the events at the mill. Braylon entrusts Sykes with cleaning up the situation, as some potential investors in his new sugar formula will be visiting the mill soon. It is revealed that Braylon intends to create a new type of sugar with an additive more addictive than [[crack cocaine]] and [[heroin]] combined, and to that end, he has hired Sergei (Armando Leduc) to conduct experiments in the mill. The men under Sykes's command were directed to abduct addicts and homeless people for Sergei's experiments, reasoning that nobody would be looking for such people if they disappeared. He is more enraged by Sykes's men accidentally abducting Ryan (Derrick Denicola), the brother of Braylon's secretary Erin (Sharon Landry), in the course of abducting Hannah, than he is by Hannah's escape and death. It is revealed that previous batches of sugar devised by Sergei caused infections in their test subjects, and even though Hannah was previously designated "status clear," Braylon and Sergei are confident she was an anomaly, as no other subjects from the most recent batch became infected.  Ryan and Erin's father Griff (Louis Herthum), a Just Rite security guard dealing with [[alcoholism]] following his wife's death, discovers strange shipments being made to a supposedly abandoned sugar mill&nbsp;– which is also being observed by Santiago&nbsp;– and learns that Braylon has hired Shadow Rock to guard it independently of his usual security team. Meanwhile, Erin begins receiving strange e-mails at her desk from a mysterious figure calling themselves "Cinderella." Apparently a mole within Just Rite, Cinderella first sends Erin financial documents showing money being spent on the abandoned mill, then a photograph of Ryan in his holding cell. Together, Griff and Erin realize that Ryan must be at the mill, and resolve to rescue him.  Sergei makes an ominous discovery&nbsp;– the latest batch of sugar, which was shipped out when it was verified clear, actually is infected as well, with the infection manifesting three months after ingestion. Upon receiving this news, Sykes gives up on the plan and decides to call in Shadow Rock's extermination team. Sergei pulls a gun, but Sykes kills him.  Erin and Griff infiltrate the mill by hiding inside a truck. While roaming around searching for Ryan, they encounter Sykes and prepare for a confrontation. However, Sykes reveals that he is Cinderella and joins them, escorting them to Ryan's cell. While they are reunited, Braylon escorts his potential investors around the mill, proudly showing them some of the test subjects. He explains while showing them one failed subject that the infection in the previous sugar batches attacks the victim's brain and breaks down their body, a point made clear when he shows them the longest-surviving subject, whose body has melted in many places. However, when Braylon opens the door of a subject he believes is "status clear," the subject is actually infected and attacks them. While one of Braylon's guards kills the infected subject, it is not before a security alarm is tripped that puts the entire mill on lockdown. This leaves Erin, Ryan, Griff and Sykes to escape through the ward where the most dangerous subjects are kept; meanwhile, Braylon and his investors escape and the investors flee, wanting no part of Braylon's plan.  The Shadow Rock forces led by Gauge arrive at the mill and begin exterminating the infected. Erin, Ryan, Griff and Sykes manage to escape, but Sykes is shot and gets separated from the group in the confusion, and Ryan discovers that despite being "status clear" earlier, the boils characteristic of an infection have developed on his arm. Colonel Briggs (Marc Gill) suddenly appears and begins killing Gauge's men after freeing the trapped Braylon. He ambushes Gauge and shoots him in the shoulder, and the two briefly exchange gunfire while discussing the internal coup Gauge staged against Briggs. Gauge gives up when his gun runs out of bullets and steps out, inviting Briggs to shoot him; however, Briggs discards his gun and rushes Gauge, allowing Gauge the chance to stab him in the stomach with his knife. Gauge then finishes the injured Briggs off with the bullet remaining in his gun's chamber.  Ryan, Erin and Griff reunite with Sykes outside the mill, who reveals that he has rigged the entire mill with a self-destruct mechanism that he needs to be close to the building to activate. Revealing his infection, Ryan volunteers to drive the dying Sykes back into the mill. They successfully trigger the bombs before Ryan is killed by Shadow Rock's forces, and Braylon, watching his work go up in flames in dismay, is attacked and killed by an infected subject.  Gauge, who escaped the explosion, salutes Griff and Erin for their work. He reveals Braylon's fate to them, then assures them that none of the infected subjects or sugar got out. However, in a final flashback, the last part of Santiago's transmission is revealed, in which he instructs Gauge to exterminate everything at the mill and then get ready to "go hunting."  In an epilogue, people from all walks of life are seen consuming large quantities of Just Rite sugar. Everything appears normal until an elderly man being examined in a hospital appears to have the infection's boils on his body. As the doctor leaves the room, the view zooms out, revealing the entire waiting room filled with victims suffering from the infection.

Jake was a star athlete on the football team at home, but in this new city, he is an outsider with a reputation for being a quick tempered brawler after an internet video of him starting a fight at one of his football games after a frustrated player from the opposing team taunted Jake about his father, who died in a drunk driving accident, circulates around his new school.  Making an attempt to fit in, at the invitation of a flirtatious classmate, Baja Miller ([[Amber Heard]]), Jake goes to a party where he is unwillingly pulled into a fight with the fighting [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] champion at the school, Ryan McCarthy ([[Cam Gigandet]]). Originally, Jake does not wish to fight until Ryan taunts him about his father who died while driving drunk with Jake in the car. Jake is brutally defeated in the fight, causing Jake to feel depressed. But a classmate, Max Cooperman ([[Evan Peters]]), who later becomes one of his best friends, introduces himself to Jake and tells him about the sport known as [[Mixed Martial Arts]]. He sees a star in Jake and asks that he meet with Martial Arts Master Jean Roqua ([[Djimon Hounsou]]). It is immediately apparent to Jake that MMA is not street fighting, but rather an art form he wants to master. Roqua agrees to take Jake as a pupil, but under the condition that Jake refrains from fighting outside of the gym which Jake agrees to, despite knowing he wishes to confront Ryan anyway. Baja attempts to apologize to Jake, but he does not sympathize with her and refuses to forgive her. Baja then confronts Ryan about the fight with Jake and proceeds to end their relationship when Ryan shows no remorse for the beating he gave him or his sadistic tendencies. Ryan begins to create a scene before the entire school but Jake tries to step in to defend Baja. After Ryan insults him again and leaves, Jake attends training with Roqua. Still angry about the incident, he is unable to calm down and train effectively. Roqua asks Jake to leave so that he could "cool off".  After he and Max leave the gym, Jake gets into a brawl with a group of guys in a Hummer whom Jake easily disposes of while Max films. This video again circulates around the school raising Jake's social status but agitating Ryan in the process. Ryan then proceeds to challenge Jake to compete in the Beatdown, an underground fighting tournament of which Ryan is the reigning champion. After having been banished from the gym by Roqua after his fight is discovered, Jake begs for forgiveness saying his anger is quelled when he is training with Roqua. Roqua agrees to allow Jake to train at his gym again, but does not take it easy on him anymore. He then prepares to compete in the Beatdown. While training with Roqua, Jake inquires why he lives in the gym. Jake discovers that Roqua is from [[Afro-Brazilians|Brazil]] and he is in [[exile]] because he believes he is the reason his brother, Joseph the favorite son, was killed and his father had disowned him for. Jake apologizes to Baja for not listening when she first apologized and the two proceed to begin a relationship.  Upon hearing that Jake has decided not to compete in the Beatdown, Ryan invites Max to hang out at his house; there he begins to [[Sparring|spar]] with Max before brutally assaulting him and leaving him at Jake's door. Jake and Baja take Max to the hospital where Jake decides to fight. Despite Baja's pleas against his decision, he states that doing nothing has consequences. Before he goes to the tournament, he has a brief argument with Roqua about his decision to fight. Roqua eventually assents and tells him to "control the outcome" of the fight. Jake arrives at the tournament where it is about to begin. After a mix-up where Jake and Ryan almost fight in the first round, they both proceed to make their way through each fight. Jake makes it to the semifinals in spite of an injury he received in the previous match due to a kick to the ribs. While Jake is recovering after the match, Baja sees him and tells him that she finally understands that Jake is fighting "so [he doesn't] have to fight again". After learning that Ryan was disqualified in his semifinal match, Jake forfeits, seeing no reason to continue. While he and Baja attempt to leave, Ryan confronts him and the two finally fight outside in the parking lot. Jake is still limited by his ribs, and Ryan at first gains the upper hand, applying a choke on Jake. However Jake escapes and, with the entire crowd watching, knocks out Ryan using one of the first combinations Roqua taught him.  The next day, a visibly injured Max has been released from the hospital. Jake has won the respect of his fellow students, including Ryan, and Roqua closes the gym with a ticket to Brazil, signaling his intention to reconcile with his father.

Never Quite the Same
 Simon Kelly who on visiting the Isle of Wight,  meets Rachel Burton,  someone he briefly knew many years before.  When he approaches her,  she claims not to remember him. He asks her if she is Rachel Burton,  and she confirms she is. Later,  when he tells Phil Harrison,  he also remembers the name.  When Phil,  who owns a local newspaper, looks up Rachel on various databases, he finds that she actually died in 1986.  The film starts just before a party in the summer of 1984,  in a country lane,  where a drug dealer is preparing to set off for a village hall party. At the party,  Simon Kelly meets Rachel Burton,  who has only gone to the party to buy drugs,  and ends up back at her house.  During the course of their conversations,  Rachel tells him she will be dead by the time she's 25,  adding that she believes life is pointless.  After spending the night with her,  Simon meets one of his friends from the party,  who laughs when he finds out where Simon has been.  Simon then throws Rachel's telephone number into the sea.  The film then cuts to the present day.  Phil Harrison arrives to visit Simon,  and finds him hungover and surrounded by empty wine bottles and lager cans.  Simon tells him about his visit to the Isle of Wight,  and his meeting with Rachel Burton. When Phil realizes Rachel Burton died in 1986,  this raises the question,  how did Simon have a conversation with someone who's dead ?  Phil doesn't believe in anything that isn't tangible,  but one of his employees at the newspaper runs a sideline publication called Actual Reality,  which features interviews with people who claim to have accidentally found doors through time. Phil tells Simon of a charity dinner he’d been to with his employee,  Chris Hampton,  and the argument he’d witnessed between Chris and a vicar who had strongly discouraged Chris from taking any further interest in the suggestion of the existence of time doors. The argument had almost developed into a fight,  as the vicar told him not to interfere with things he knew nothing about,  and that if he did,  no good would come of it.  The film raises as many questions as it answers as Phil gets Simon to describe his daytrip in detail.  Through this they work out that Simon must have accidentally gone back in time before he met Rachel,  and he must also have come back to the present day before he came home.  Simon has told Phil he climbed over the wall from a church yard into a park,  as a shortcut,  and that he took the same route later when he came back.  Phil is convinced this must be where the time door is,  on the basis that it is the only place he passed once in each direction.  Phil does some more research and finds out Rachel Burton had committed suicide in 1986 due to depression,  after the death of her mother in a car accident.  Simon admits he feels partly to blame because he feels that he used Rachel,  and never went back to see her again. Phil comments that they are both probably to blame and confesses that it was he who sold her the drugs at the party where Simon met her. They know from Phil’s research, the date of the accident in which Rachel’s mother died,  and go back to 1984 on  the night before it is due to happen. They set fire to her mother’s car so she cannot drive it and have the accident.  The film concludes when a week later,  Phil takes Simon to the railway station and Rachel Burton walks by.  Phil,  who has an up-to-date photograph of her,  ushers Simon in her direction,  they have a conversation and this time she remembers him. As they are sitting in Phil’s car afterwards,  watching the Isle of Wight ferry leave Portsmouth,  Simon says he’s barely able to believe the events of the last week.  Phil then reveals that the reason Rachel recognized Simon is that the day after the car fire,  he had returned to the island on his own,  and visited Rachel Burton’s home,  to check if her mother was still alive.  As an optional extra he had told Rachel to meet him in a café in Ryde on the following Saturday.  Obviously he had failed to show up as he’d gone back to his own time by then.  But he knew Simon had gone over there on that date as it was his birthday, and he’d told Phil which café he had been in.

Nim lives with her father on a South Pacific island and has several local animals for company: [[Selkie]] the [[sea lion]], Fred the [[bearded dragon]], Chica the [[sea turtle]], and [[Galileo]] the [[pelican]]. Jack takes the boat for a two-day scientific mission to find ''Protozoa nim'' (a new species of [[plankton]] he named after his daughter); he wants to take his daughter along, but she convinces him that she needs to stay to oversee the imminent hatching of Chica's eggs and can manage on her own; they will be able to communicate by satellite phone.  Nim, who is fond of Alex Rover adventure books written by Alexandra Rover ([[Jodie Foster]]), receives an email addressed to her father with an inquiry about his field of knowledge. The sender, "Alex Rover", seems to be the explorer, but is actually Alexandra, a [[neuroticism|neurotic]] [[San Francisco|San Franciscan]] who constantly imagines that she is speaking to her fictional character Alex Rover (also portrayed by Butler). An email conversation follows. She goes to the island with the volcano, but is injured.  Jack suffers a shipwreck in a cyclone, making it impossible for him to communicate with Nim, and does not return as planned. Galileo brings Jack things he needs to fix his ship.

The island is visited by loud, ugly tourists from [[Brisbane]], Australia, whom Nim believes to be pirates. As the tourists approach the island, Nim makes it seem uninhabitable by catapulting lizards to shore. She also makes a fire in the crater of the volcano, which fools the tourists into thinking the volcano is erupting. By rolling down boulders to simulate an avalanche. While doing this, she inadvertently triggers an actual eruption. Without revealing herself, she gets out of the crater just in time as a plume of ash bursts out. Down at the beach the tourists scramble to the boats. One of them, a boy, Edmund, sees and catches up with Nim. He is confused by her presence and she tells him she lives on the island.

Fortunately, Jack reaches the island windsurfing on a makeshift catamaran. Jack and Alex meet and begin to get to know each other (Alex amazed at Jack being identical to how she pictured her fictional character), and the film ends with them all playing on the beach using a coconut as a ball.  
Noir Drive
  In Sydney in 1952 and returning from a month away, the private investigator Reilly finds his office has been taken over by the building's janitor, Jerry Vane, who has been impersonating him in his absence. Roughing Vane over, Reilly discovers he has taken a missing person's case in which an insurance company is trying to locate someone named Alex Pleshette. However, when Reilly presents himself to the insurance office to drop the case, the owner Max Arnett claims he never hired his agency to begin with. On the way out however, Arnett's receptionist inadvertently gives away the truth that Reilly was in fact hired.  Heading back to his office, Reilly is confronted by two thugs in an alley who beat him and tell him to lay off the Pleshette case. In his office a short time later, a beautiful young woman in black arrives. Presenting herself as Mrs. Pleshette, Reilly assumes she is Alex Pleshette's wife, however she curtly informs him that her husband is dead, and that she is actually Alexandra, better known as Alex Pleshette. She tells him to stop interfering as she is now no longer missing, and departs – leaving him even more confused.  Next day, Reilly finds out from his police detective friend Jack Bosley that Alex Pleshette witnessed the murder of her husband, a wealthy tycoon named Donald Pleshette who was at the time being investigated for company insurance fraud. However, she was knocked unconscious by the killer and as a result is unable to remember the event. Not long after this, she went missing and no one knew where she was, not even her lover Gabe Preston, her husband's disgruntled business partner. Reilly recognizes that Preston would thus have a motive for murder, but Bosley explains that he has a strong alibi.  Later, Reilly gives Vane a camera and instructs him to follow Arnett and take photos of anything that appears interesting. Meanwhile, he drives to the Pleshette mansion on Noir Drive to confront Alex. She concedes that although she was bitter towards her husband as a result of the fraud allegations against him, she had no proof that her husband was even involved in the fraud, and that even if she did she couldn't disclose them because of the legal principle of [[Spousal privilege|marital privilege]], whereby spouses cannot testify against each other. They are then interrupted by the arrival of Gabe Preston. Alex introduces them before promptly leading Reilly out of the house. On his way out, Reilly explains to Alex that whoever hired him did so on the instruction of her husband's killer, worried that she may regain her memory at any time, and wanting her close by if she did. Reilly says he believes she knows more than she realises, but she replies "at times we all want to be kept in the dark".  Back at his office, Reilly looks through the photos taken by Vane, and in one sees Max Arnett meeting up with Gabe Preston. He promptly calls Bosley, who confirms that Preston's alibi was in fact Arnett. Reilly rushes off to the Pleshette mansion but Preston and Alex have left for good.  Far way on a tropical island resort, Preston and Alex lounge back on a beach. Alex however is unsettled – her memory then triggered by the pop of the champagne cork – and she realises it was Gabe Preston who murdered her husband. Looking down to reveal the wedding ring she now wears as Mrs. Alex Preston, it occurs to her that Preston now not only has access to the entire fortune, but that she is unable to testify against him because of marital privilege.

Nothing but the Truth (2008 American film)
 Rachel Armstrong ([[Kate Beckinsale]]) is an ambitious reporter for the ''Capital Sun-Times''. When she discovers a fellow mother at her son's school, Erica Van Doren ([[Vera Farmiga]]) is working as a covert operative for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and recently returned from [[Venezuela]], where she was investigating an assassination attempt on the [[President of the United States]], she confronts her and requests confirmation. Erica refuses to cooperate, but Rachel has no doubts about the veracity of the report, and her story becomes front-page news with the support of editor Bonnie Benjamin ([[Angela Bassett]]) and Avril Aaronson ([[Noah Wyle]]), who serves as the newspaper's legal counselor.  Because revealing a covert operative's identity is a [[treason]]ous offence and because the individual who leaked the information to Rachel is a potential threat to national security, special [[Federal prosecutor]] Patton Dubois ([[Matt Dillon]]) convenes a [[grand jury]] and demands to know who her source is, information she refuses to divulge. High-profile attorney Albert Burnside ([[Alan Alda]]), hired by the newspaper to defend Rachel, is certain his personal friendship with Judge Hall will facilitate matters and is shocked when his client is jailed for contempt of court.  Days become weeks, and then months, during the course of which Van Doren is murdered in a politically motivated attack. Yet Rachel steadfastly defends the [[Protection of sources|principle of confidentiality]], a position that eventually estranges her husband Ray ([[David Schwimmer]]), alienates her young son Timmy ([[Preston Bailey]]), and costs her embattled newspaper millions of dollars in fines and legal fees. However, Dubois is only interested in Armstrong's original source. Armstrong pleads to Dubois that she could never give up her source as they would have to deal with the consequential ramifications of the death of Van Doren. Burnside even argues her case before the Supreme Court, but they decide against him 5–4, citing the overriding concern of national security.  Eventually, Judge Hall decides to release Armstrong from jail, as he is convinced she will never divulge her source and, therefore, cannot be pressured through continued incarceration. On the day she is released, Dubois has the [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] arrest her for obstruction of justice and convinces her to take a deal for a shortened sentence rather than go to trial. She agrees to two years in prison, with the possibility of early parole for good behavior. As Armstrong is taken to the facility, she reminisces about her time as a volunteer at Timmy's school, and when she spoke to Van Doren's daughter, Alison, who revealed to her on a school field trip that her mother worked for the government and recently went to Venezuela on "business", thus revealing Alison as the original source.  
North Starr
 A young [[African American]] man living in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] witnesses his best friend's brutal murder, then flees to the small, racially intolerant, backwater town of Trublin.  
Nothing like the Holidays
  At Chicago [[O'Hare International Airport]], a group of Marines have just returned to the US from Iraq. As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez ([[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]]). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez ([[Alfred Molina]]) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez ([[Elizabeth Peña]]) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return.  Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies.  Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny ([[Luis Guzman]]) and Ozzy ([[Jay Hernandez]]), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis ([[Manny Pérez]]), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Alexis, and Alexis stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Alexis, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back then they make their way to Edy's store.  Jesse's sister Roxanna ([[Vanessa Ferlito]]) arrives by taxi, although everyone assumes she came in a limo because they all assume that she made it big in Hollywood as an actress. Jesse's Brother Mauricio ([[John Leguizamo]]) also arrives, along with his wife Sarah ([[Debra Messing]]). Sarah greets Anna and it is evident that she is not exactly comfortable around her in-laws but she is making an effort, even speaking a bit of Spanish. However, the topic drifts towards children and Anna makes it very clear that she wants grandchildren, but Sarah is a very business driven woman and isn't ready for kids, this causes some tension between Sarah, Anna, and Mauricio. After things settle down, everyone sits down and begins to catch up and each persons story is brought up: Jesse has just returned from a three-year tour in Iraq and is being prepared by Edy to take up the family business; Roxanna is waiting on news regarding a new TV deal; and Mauricio is an attorney and Sarah is in finances and making a great deal of money, but don't have time for much else. The conversation moves towards Jesse's experience in Iraq, but it is obvious that he does not want to talk about it (important later). Soon after, Marissa ([[Melonie Diaz]]), her son, and her boyfriend Fernando ([[Ramses Jimenez]]) arrive. Marissa is Roxanna's best friend from childhood, and Jesse's ex-girlfriend. It is evident that Jesse still has feelings for Marissa and vice versa, but there is much tension in the air.  After everyone has arrived, they all sit down for Christmas dinner. Everyone is digging into an abundant pile of food, chatting away, while Sarah sits there with a look of awe on her face as she has never experienced the holidays with Mauricio's family. Edy is about to give a toast to everyone but gets a call, it seems that Edy has been getting a lot of calls, and often runs out when he does which gets Anna suspicious that he is having an affair, and cheating on her again (there was one previous incident in the past). Well, when the phone rings during Edy's toast, he stops to answer the call, and having broken the last straw, Anna proclaims that she is divorcing Edy. At first everyone thinks this is a joke, but it is soon evident that Anna is dead serious. Edy reacts with little emotion, saying that if it is what Anna wants then he can't really do anything about it. Mauricio is vehemently against this and tries to get some support from Jesse, whose response is similar to his father's, which angers Mauricio further. At this time, Johnny, Ozzy, Marissa and Fernando excuse themselves as it is a family matter. After more arguing, everyone leaves to vent, except for Sarah, who stays at her seat and continues eating, sort of a gesture of comfort/support to Anna; and the two have a somewhat awkward yet endearing bonding moment.  At night, Jesse is about to go to bed when Edy shows up, having been kicked out of the bed room and is now bunking with Jesse. Father and son have a conversation about Jesse's experiences but Edy can't really get much out of his son.  Later that night, Mauricio is up in the attic thinking about the night's events when Roxanna shows up. The two share a drink and Jesse shows up. The siblings reminisce about their childhood and what the future will be like after their parents divorce. Both Roxanna and Jesse are relatively neutral on the matter, but Mauricio is very against them. Being the only one of the three to be married, he believes that after 36 years of marriage, their parents have to have at least some love for each other, and that there is always a chance to salvage what remains of their marriage and he says all this while in his underwear (humorous scene).  In the morning, Jesse catches up with Marissa while she is walking to work. She still hasn't forgiven him for leaving her several years ago. As it turns out, Jesse didn't want to stay in town and follow in his father's footsteps and ended up enlisting in the Marines. While in Iraq, his unit was holed up in a building for the night, Lenny offered to take Jesse's watch so he can grab something to eat. While Jesse is getting some food, a rocket propelled grenade is shot into the building and Lenny is killed, while everyone else is injured. Ever since then, Jesse blames himself for Lenny's death since it was supposed to be his watch, and his life that would be lost. Marissa sympathizes and forgives him.  Back at the house, Mauricio is attempting to get Anna and Edy back together by bringing over their priest, Father Torres (Manny Sosa). Anna returns home and Mauricio brings her into the kitchen. Anna is clearly drunk and is very upset. Another argument ensues and everyone is at each other's throats. Mauricio argues with Anna regarding having children, Roxanna reveals that shes not a star and can barely make ends meet. Both Mauricio and Roxanna think Jesse has it easy, since he gets the store to manage as soon as he returned. However, Jesse doesn't want to manage the store and his guilt over Lenny's death has been haunting him since his return. After more arguing, everyone leaves. Roxanna, Jesse and Mauricio end up in a bar to drink/party to vent off some tension.  Sarah gets back to the house and finds out that everyone has left. Edy offers to give her a ride to the bar where everyone is. While driving Sarah to the bar to meet the others, Edy appears to have a heart attack and stomps on the brakes. Luckily, they skid into a parking area and no one is injured; Sarah is able to fetch Edy's medication from the glove box in time. As Sarah looks at the bottles, she realizes that Edy is really very ill and that that's the reason he's getting those phone calls (the doctor). Edy makes her promise to not tell anyone, since he doesn't want anyone to worry so they can enjoy the holidays.  At the bar, everyone takes the chance to have some fun, drinking and dancing. Sarah gets hammered and starts dancing with Mauricio. Everyone is having a blast and Jesse takes the time to talk to Marissa. Roxanna, receives a call from her agent (with no actual news regarding the new part), goes outside to answer the phone and have a smoke. While Roxanna is out having a smoke, Ozzy comes out to talk to her. It is obvious that Ozzy likes Roxanna, but she is a bit apprehensive as she sees him as a gang-member type person, although Marissa has noted that he hasn't been part of that crowd for quite some time.  Roxanna and Ozzy go to the local ice rink to talk, and Roxanna tells him that she really isn't much of a star since she has only had a few small roles on TV and in commercials and can't really get a big part. Ozzy assures her that she will get her big break, but she is not so sure. Roxanna mentions returning home since her career isn't going anywhere, and her mom may need her around during the divorce. Ozzy is happy that Roxanna may stay, but is supportive of her career.  The next day, everyone prepares to have a little Christmas carol parade, where people travel from house to house caroling, and people join along the way until nearly the entire neighborhood has joined in. The parade ends with everyone arriving at the church for a big party/dinner. Everyone is dancing and having fun. Fernando goes off to get something to drink and Jesse asks Marissa for a dance. The two begins to get close and Jesse leans in to kiss her, just as Fernando lunges in and hits Jesse. Jesse pummels Fernando before his friends drag him off. While this is happening, Ozzy can't take it anymore and leaves to confront Alexis. Alexis is returning home with his mother and sees Ozzy. Knowing what Ozzy has come to do, he tells his mother to go into the house and make dinner, while he goes outside with Ozzy. Outside, Alexis tells Ozzy that he's ready to die, and has been for many years while in prison. Ozzy is visibly struggling to decide whether or not to kill Alexis, just then, his phone rings, it's Roxanna. Ozzy gives up, and lets Alexis live, and leaves to meet Roxanna. Ozzy and Roxanna go to the river, where he gets rid of the gun, and the two kiss.  After midnight mass, Edy drives Anna home. On the ride home Anna confronts Edy about his affair, but all Edy will say is that all he wants is to have a good Christmas with the whole family, and that they should keep it together until the kids leave. Anna says that after the kids leave, there will be nothing more to talk about.  Edy is now alone in the kitchen, drinking. Jesse and Mauricio return home and join their father, each drinking to their own little problems. Edy, decides to do one last thing for Anna and finally cut down that tree so the three go outside and secure the tree to a chain that is connected to the rear bumper of Edy's car. Edy guns the engine but the rear bumper comes off and he crashes into a parked car, injuring himself.  Anna calls the ambulance and Edy is rushed off to the hospital. Before the ambulance leaves, Sarah runs out to Anna and hands her all of Edy's medications since she's the only one who knows how serious his health is. The whole family is at the hospital to check on Edy. It turns out that Edy has cancer, it's serious but he's being treated for it. Anna finally realizes that Edy was not cheating on her, and that the Susan that Edy was talking to was actually his oncologist. The couple make their peace and profess love for each other, and then Anna smacks Edy for being stupid and not telling her sooner.  Having seen how frail life can be, Sarah decides to have children, and take the new position at work, and will try to balance both in her life with support from Mauricio.  Back at the house, Anna is teaching Roxanna and Sarah how to cook with moderate success. Roxanna gets a call from her agent, and when she returns, it appears as she has not gotten the part. Outside the house, Ozzy comes by to talk to Roxanna and she reveals that she actually did get the part, but it wasn't a very big part anyway, and she thought it would be best to stick with her family during these times, so she turned down the part.  Jesse visits Marissa to drop off some Christmas presents and to apologize for his behavior the previous night. She forgives him, but she has a relationship with Fernando now and a happy family life. Jesse concedes and wishes her a happy life. After leaving, Jesse sits on a park bench, making a call to Lenny's parents to tell them about their son and how he died so he can get closure and move on.  After discharge from the hospital, Edy takes Jesse to his store, Jesse has decided to take up the family business instead of going back to Iraq.

The Objective
  In [[Ghazni Province]], [[Afghanistan]], a [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] team consisting of team leader Sergeant Wally Hamer, Master-Sergeant Kenny Tanner, Sergeants Vince Degetau, Trinoski, Tim Cole, and Pete Sadler meets [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Agent Benjamin Keynes, who indicates that their mission is to find a very important [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[cleric]] by the name of Mohammed Aban. Hamer, briefs the men to be ready. After being inserted, the team finds a local guide, Abdul, in a village in Southern Afghanistan, where Aban is from. Together, they go to the mountains, where the cleric has a reputation for hiding.  As they go further into the mountains, they begin to have strange encounters. First, they are ambushed by gunmen who kill Trinoski. The team returns fire, killing multiple gunmen, but when they check the bodies, they have disappeared. That night, the team spots headlights of a vehicle approaching. However, the two lights separate and then speedily fly into the sky and disappear. After speculating on what the lights may have been, they radio for a helicopter to resupply them. The next day, they cannot get reception on their radio or GPS. Their truck, damaged from the ambush, is struggling to move up the mountain. At night, the team hears a helicopter approaching, though they cannot spot it. As their radio is not working, they attempt to signal the helicopter. As the helicopter, still unseen, seems to be directly on top of them, the noise abruptly stops (something that shouldn't be physically possible). Meanwhile, the radio picks up what sounds like [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]], but no one can understand it. They cache Trinoski's body so that they can move to a safer position for the night. The next morning, the team finds parts of Trinoski's body strewn out across rocks. Further up the mountain, they spot strange, triangular markers made of sticks across the mountain's surface. As they continue on foot with their mission in the rocky and barren landscape, fatigue, frustration and confusion take their toll on the members of the team and they come across a cave. Inside, they find an old man who gives them shelter and refills their canteens. Sergeant Sadler notices that under the man's robes, he appears to be wearing a nineteenth-century British army uniform. Sadler tells the others of a legend of how a British regiment disappeared in Afghanistan's mountains, leaving only one survivor. In the morning Sergeant Cole observes the old man apparently talking to himself, but when Cole looks through his night vision goggles, he sees a group of men with swords in black robes. Panicking, the soldier opens fire, accidentally killing the old man. Abdul says they must bury the body, but Keynes orders the team to move on in case the enemy heard them. Degeteau develops horrible stomach pains. As he tries to drink from a canteen, he finds that it is filled with sand, as are the containers of everyone else. Further on, Abdul is surprised to find that there is an entire valley that wasn't there previously. Tensions further increase when the team encounters a bright light at night. As Tanner and Cole try to flank the light, believing it to be a ruse by the Taliban, they're immediately vaporized. The next morning, Abdul warns Keynes that they are dealing with a supernatural phenomenon that is beyond human conception and has deadly consequences; he then commits suicide by stepping off a cliff.  As the team progresses further and tensions among the men increase, the remaining soldiers confront Keynes and demand the truth. Keynes shows them a recording from his thermal imaging camera and informs them about the real motive. The thermal video shows a triangular object in the desert. Being nearly invisible to the naked eye, it lifts off the ground after three (supposed) men, including Mohammed Aban, walk to it and vanishes right in front of Keynes' eyes. It was this object that killed the men. The CIA has been monitoring this phenomenon since 1980 and sent Keynes and the special forces team there to further investigate it. The whole time, Keynes has been recording with his special thermal camera and sending the images to Langley via an advanced laser aimed at CIA satellites. Keynes theorizes that this object originates from an ancient Indian mythology called '[[Vimana]]s', a sort of UFO-related phenomenon that occurred when [[Alexander the Great]] rode through this area of land as he was conquering, and the bright lights and the ghostly gunmen are associated with it. He also explains that the team is an 'expendable' for the investigation and they will not be rescued, which causes a brief scuffle with the agitated team leader, who disappears the next morning.  Running out of ammunition, water and food, the team wanders further into the desert where they finally encounter the vimanas at what appears to be the location that the British regiment was destroyed. Sadler, overwhelmed with fear, opens fire upon the seemingly invisible vimanas only to be vaporized. Keynes flees with Degetau and abandons him later, as he is too sick to continue, and later hears his screams before being obliterated by the objects. Exhausted and traumatized, Keynes searches for water. He encounters an oasis and drinks water from it only to discover the body of Hamer laying next to the water. Unable to grasp the horror, he passes out. When he wakes up in the night, he hears the distant sound of a helicopter and fires his flare gun. Simultaneously, several flares fire up from the valley. The bright light he encountered earlier re-appears and two beings from it approach him. As it touches his forehead, he sees visions and hallucinations of various objects and landscapes from his previous encounters, causing him to go into a trance. In the final scene he is shown floating several inches above a bed with a talisman he took from Aban's home in his hand, inside a hospital room, where doctors and a military colonel are watching him through a glass window. In a trance, he finally whispers, "It will save us all..."  In the final credits, interviews of Keynes' wife are shown in which she says that the family has not yet been informed about him and concludes him to be missing.  
Nu-Meri: Book of the New Spawn
   
Odysseus and the Isle of the Mists
 An elderly Homer (Perry Long) sits down in his home and begins writing a lost installment of the Odyssey, the tale of the Isle of the Mists, a story he felt was too terrible to tell before.  Years prior, Homer ([[Randal Edwards]]) is a member of Odysseus's ([[Arnold Vosloo]]) crew as they sail back to Ithaca following the Trojan War. The crew also includes [[Perimedes]] ([[JR Bourne]]), [[Eurylochus (mythology)|Eurylochus]] ([[Steve Bacic]]), Christos (Michael Antonakos) and others. During their travels, they become lost in a deep fog and encounter [[vampires|strange flying creatures]] who kill several men and drink their blood. The only thing that can kill the creatures is a wooden stake through the heart. In disarray, the crew lands at an island, the fabled Isle of the Mists, to affect repairs and recovery from the attack.  After more encounters with the winged creatures, the crew meets a mysterious woman ([[Stefanie von Pfetten]]) who takes them to her refuge in the woods. Much to their surprise, she appears to be immune to the attacks of the creatures. Some of the crew remains suspicious even as they accept food and shelter from the woman. They learn of the Hellfire Cross, a mystical sword sealed by the gods on the island, that they come to believe can help them survive. The remaining crew decide to recover the Hellfire Cross as part of their plan to relaunch their ship.  After receiving visions from [[Athena]] ([[Sonya Salomaa]]), Odysseus realizes the mysterious woman is not what she seems. She uses her powers to transform into Odysseus's wife [[Penelope]] ([[Leah Gibson]]) and seduces him. Her failure to account for Penelope aging since the last time Odysseus saw her makes him realize the illusion, but not before he has sex with her. Odysseus and his remaining men realize her true identity: [[Persephone]], the wife of [[Hades]] who has been banished to the Isle of the Mists and sealed there by the Hellfire Cross. Persephone reveals that the winged creatures are her children by Hades, and that she plans to escape the island with them to rule the world. Furthermore, she is now pregnant with a son by Odysseus.  Odysseus and his men escape to the cave where the Hellfire Cross is sealed and obtain it, however, all but Odysseus and Homer die. They are confronted by Persephone, who thanks them for her freedom and attempts to convince Odysseus to serve her, as the Hellfire Cross cannot be wielded by a god. When he refuses, she tells them she will merely wait until her mortal son is born and ages instead. She starts to set the winged creatures free on the world and attempts to force Odysseus to cut his own throat, but he overcomes her power and impales her through the stomach, killing Persephone, their son and all the creatures. Some time after Persephone's death, Odysseus and Homer return to the sea and continue back to Ithaca.  Completing his story, the aged Homer muses about the origins of the winged creatures, how they could only be killed by a stake through the heart, and how they fear the sign of the cross. On the Isle of the Mists, Eurylochus - who was attacked by the creatures in the cave - has transformed into one of the creatures and flies off freely into the world.

Once Upon a Time (2008 film)
 The film is set in Seoul, 1945, during the final days of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]]. Kanemura is a well-connected con artist who makes money by selling ancient Korean artifacts to wealthy Japanese collectors. His eyes are set on Haruko, a beautiful jazz singer in a downtown nightclub; unbeknownst to anyone, Haruko has been moonlighting as "Haedanghwa" ("[[Rugosa Rose]]"), a cat burglar who has carried out a succession of high-profile thefts. She is also pursued by Yamada, a colonel in the [[Kempeitai|Japanese military police]], who is jealous of Kanemura's affections towards her. The owner of the nightclub and his chef, Hee-bong, secretly work for the [[Korean independence movement]].  After a twenty-year search, the Japanese Chief of State—a high-ranking official in Korea—has recovered the "Light of the East", a  diamond and lost treasure from the ancient kingdom of [[Silla]]. Receiving orders to send the diamond to Japan, a lavish send-off party is arranged. Kanemura attends the event with Haruko; he plans to steal the diamond, but she has the same idea, and both are surprised to see the other when they get to the safe where it is kept. After a brief struggle, it is Haruko who makes her escape with the diamond, leaving Kanemura to face the authorities. But the nightclub owner and his chef are also at the party, and their bungled assassination attempt on the Chief of State results in a fire, allowing Kanemura to slip away in the confusion.  Yamada is given the task of retrieving the diamond, much to the chagrin of Suzimura, the chief of police, who feels that he has jurisdiction. Hasekawa, a police inspector, immediately suspects Haruko, but Yamada won't hear of it, blinded by his feelings for her. Meanwhile, Kanemura manages to track down Haruko, finding her on a train to [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] disguised as a geisha. She refuses to hand over the diamond, but he has planted explosives on the railway track, and, having cut off her escape route, succeeds in dragging her back to Seoul.  Unable to discover the diamond's whereabouts, Yamada rounds up 100 Korean civilians and orders them to be executed if it is not returned. Kanemura is also unsuccessful in getting Haruko to give up the diamond, so he allows her to slip away and then secretly follows her. She leads him to a local pawn shop, but her accomplice Jang-cheon is really an agent of the Korean independence movement, and when Kanemura reveals himself as the leader of the Korean secret intelligence, the two men turn against her. Disguised in Japanese military uniforms and with the diamond now in their possession, they are about to make their getaway when Hasekawa arrives on the scene and holds them at gunpoint. Suzimura and his other police officers soon follow, but he misreads the situation; believing Hasekawa to be a traitor who has taken Japanese soldiers captive, he orders his men to shoot him. This allows Kanemura and Jang-cheon to escape through a hidden tunnel, but Haruko is captured.  Jang-cheon thinks that he has the diamond, but Kanemura has switched it, and, feigning injury, he tells Jang-cheon to go on without him; he does, but is soon after arrested and thrown in with the other hostages. Now on his own, Kanemura negotiates a deal with the Chief of State: he will return the diamond in exchange for Haruko and ten crates of gold. Yamada is sent to make the exchange, but the Chief is stopped by the chef and nightclub owner, who are trying to make good on their assassination attempt. The two independence fighters are injured in a shootout with Japanese soldiers, but succeed in their objective, blowing up the Chief's car. Yamada makes the exchange with Kamemura, but attempts to double cross him, and the two men fight. The diamond is broken, and Kanemura manages to escape with Haruko and the gold. He later reveals that the diamond was in fact a fake, and that he manipulated the whole event to secure gold from the Japanese for the purposes of rebuilding Korea. Back in Seoul, the execution of civilians is halted by the [[Gyokuon-hōsō|radio broadcast]] announcing the [[surrender of Japan]].

On War (film)
  Bertrand (Mathieu Amalric), a film director, is conducting research for his latest film, and asks a funeral director if he can stay back at his parlour after the close of business. Bertrand cannot resist getting into a coffin, and accidentally knocks the lid down, locking himself in. When he’s released the following morning, it’s clear he’s been profoundly affected by the experience.  That night, he considers hiring his regular prostitute, but cancels after a film on TV—David Cronenberg's ''eXistenZ'' – grabs his attention. The next day—still ignoring his girlfriend, Louise—Bertrand encounters a group of policeman on the street and is momentarily confused when he’s unable to find a specific reason why they’re there.  In the evening, he returns to the funeral parlour, where a strange man, Charles (Guillaume Depardieu), breaks in with him. After asking Bertrand to describe his experience in the coffin, the man eventually takes him to a countryside mansion, the headquarters to a cult called The Kingdom.  '''Book I – The Nature of War'''  The cult’s leader, Uma (Asia Argento), a young woman who tapes her breasts and wears conservative clothing, tells Bertrand that if he wants “pleasure”, he must join them in their “war”. Although initially uncomfortable about being denied access to a phone, and unsettled by the sexual advances of a younger member, Maria (Léa Seydoux), Bertrand soon befriends a fellow member called Rachel and finds himself taking part in activities designed to bring him closer to the “pure existence” experienced by people like the Native Americans (photos of whom line the walls of the mansion).  These activities include: trust exercises; crawling up and down a sand patch on all fours; touching, and being touched by, a partner; wandering the woods in animal masks; simulated sex; receiving a form of communion from Uma; and listening to Uma read pornography. After the group spend a long evening dancing in the woods, Bertrand watches a woman in a Venetian mask strip naked and drift into the river. Unable to swim, he sits on the bank and watches.  His two-week trial period with the cult complete, he returns to the city and attempts to explain what he’s been through to his girlfriend, Louise, making mention of his transcendent moment with the woman in the river. Unable to re-adjust, however, (and visited by a violent dream in which a man has his eyes gouged out with scissors), he quickly decides to drop his film and return to the cult, now more committed to its cause than ever.  '''Book IV – Commitment'''  Things grow weirder as Uma introduces Bertrand to a room of sculptures resembling skinless bodies. Around this time, he also starts to move in and out of a dream-state, imagining that he's a soldier in a trench fighting against an unseen enemy. His "beautiful" performance in the trenches earns him Uma's praise.  Louise visits the mansion but, unable to understand the cult, simply ends up wandering its grounds. Shortly after, a concerned friend of Bertrand's visits but is promptly expelled by him for suggesting that he leave the cult.  Meanwhile, a young man, Pierre, who was being groomed by Charles to “carry the sword” as a lieutenant in the organisation, accidentally shoots himself in the head with a rifle. Uma, distraught, consults with an authoritative older man, Le Grand Hou, possibly a former leader of the group. After reminding her that she’s a good "warrior", he enigmatically asks her if she’d ever hoped that the sky would rend before her eyes. Her answer is "Yes, often".  '''Book VII – Attack'''  In his dream-state, Bertrand is now a lieutenant and carries a sword. Hunting through the forest for animals (which we hear but don't see), he tells us in a voice-over that his task now is to kill Colonel Kurtz, which is the same task given to Martin Sheen’s character in ''Apocalypse Now''. He drifts down the river (apparently able to swim in the dream-state) but stops when he comes across Pierre’s wrapped-up body. The meaning behind the presence of Pierre's body in Bertrand's dream is ambiguous.  Back in reality, Bertrand decides that it's time to say goodbye to Uma and leave the cult once more. She warns him one last time about the difficulties he will face on the outside. The film ends with Bertrand sat on a bench back in the city, smiling as he listens to Bob Dylan.

One Missed Call (2008 film)
 The film begins with a young girl being rescued from a burning hospital. A firefighter asks her if her mother is still inside, to which she remains speechless.  Meanwhile, Shelley, a college student, sits outside near her koi pond in her Japanese-styled home and after having a chat over the phone with Leann, she hears her cat making strange noises. Shelley walks towards it but after a quick second, she finds it standing on the other side of the pond. Bewildered by the situation, she suddenly hears strange murmuring in the pond and out of nowhere, a hand emerges and drags Shelley into the pond, drowning her. A red candy then appears on the surface and the same hand proceeds to drag the cat and drowns it as well.  Many weeks later, college student Beth Raymond is talking with her friend, Leann, who attended Shelley's funeral. Leann's cellphone rings with a lullaby-like [[ringtone]], and it says it's from Shelley. Leann listens to the [[voicemail]], which is herself screaming. The voicemail is dated three days in the future. Leann begins to experience [[hallucinations]] that make her increasingly anxious. While walking home minutes before the time on the voicemail, she calls Beth. Beth runs to get Leann, but unfortunately, she arrives at the same time where Leann accidentally falls off from an overpass and lands on top of a speeding train, killing her. A red candy pops out of her mouth and Leann's chopped hand dials an unknown number on her phone.   At Leann's funeral, Beth's roommate, Taylor, is talking about Shelley receiving a strange voicemail before her death, just like Leann had. Brian, Leann's ex-boyfriend, begins to see disturbing [[Apparitional experience|apparitions]], and leaves the funeral in a rush. Beth catches Brian outside a coffee shop and Brian shows her a voicemail he received the night Leann died, from Leann's phone. Beth realizes the voicemail is dated mere seconds away. An explosion at a nearby construction site sends a rebar through Brian's torso. Similar to Leann, Brian coughs out a red hard candy and collapses, as Beth stares in horror.  When Beth arrives home, a distraught Taylor is waiting for her. Taylor says she knows she's next, even though she hasn't received a voicemail. Beth assures her that it isn't going to happen, and takes the batteries out of both their cellphones to ensure they can't receive calls. Later that night, Beth and Taylor are awakened by the lullaby ringtone coming from Taylor's battery-less cellphone. Despite having no power source, Taylor's phone screen displays a video message of her death, dated two days in the future.  The next morning, Andrews visits Beth, saying his sister was the one who called Shelley, despite his sister being dead at the time of the call. He also says he traced the voicemail left on his sister's phone and was going to find out more about the person who sent it, Marie Layton. Andrews goes through the local autopsy reports, and finds a report for Ellie Layton, Marie's eldest daughter, who died of an [[asthma attack]]. They find records for hospital visits for Ellie and Laurel, who is Ellie's younger sister. Laurel was injured often, which leads Beth to suspect [[child abuse|abuse]] from her mother. As Taylor's time approaches, Beth races to her, and sees Taylor being choked to death by an unseen force. A red hard candy falls out of her mouth. Suddenly, Beth's phone begins to ring and she finds a voicemail dated for tomorrow. In an effort to save herself, Beth decides to find out more about the hospital fire alone.  At the hospital and with less than 30 minutes left, Beth is frightened by various apparitions. She runs into Andrews, and the two try to escape the hospital. They are later separated and Beth finds a [[Crawl space (basement)|crawlspace]]. She discovers Marie's body, burned to death and clutching a cell phone. At the time of Beth's foretold death, Marie's corpse assaults her while weeping. It is later revealed that Marie was actually protecting Beth, not trying to hurt her. Amazingly, Beth survives her predicted death.  While visiting Laurel, Andrews goes to her room and finds her teddy bear with a video disc in its back. The disc is a video of a camera Marie hid to monitor Laurel and Ellie. The disc reveals that Ellie had cut Laurel's arm with a butcher knife. Marie had entered and realized that the abuse she has been blamed for has been Ellie all along. She then left to take Laurel to the hospital, locking Ellie in the bedroom. Ellie suffers an asthma attack and dies while dialing her mother's cell, making Marie the first real victim of the curse as she died in the hospital fire after leaving the room. Laurel tells Andrews that though Ellie hurt her, she always gave her the red hard candies, the ones found in the mouths of all the victims. Andrews' cellphone begins to ring with a voicemail dated for thirty minutes later.  Andrews realizes that the [[ghost|force]] behind the murders is Ellie, and races to Beth. After he arrives at her house, the two hear a knock on the door. As Andrews looks through the peephole, a knife stabs through it and kills him. Ellie's spirit appears and reaches out to kill Beth. The spirit of Marie then appears and grabs Ellie, saving Beth yet again. A red candy spills out of Andrews' mouth and his cell begins to dial a number on its own, revealing that Ellie's ghost is still out there, and more people will die.

Ong Bak 2
 The film begins in 1431 [[feudal]] [[Siam]]. It is a time of political upheaval, treachery and danger. The opening scene explains how during the reign of [[Borommarachathirat II|Boromarajatiraj II]] of the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], the Ayutthaya royal court became more powerful than the [[Sukhothai kingdom]] and expanded to the east. The Ayutthaya army besieged the [[cambodia|Kingdom of Gods]] for several months. The king sent his son, Prince Indraracha to rule the kingdom.  At the new kingdom, Lord Sihadecho is a provincial ruler, and a gallant and noble warrior of a formally great [[dynasty]]. His son, Tien, a spirited and unyielding youth, aspires to be just like his father, but is forced to undergo dance lessons instead much to his disdain. Meanwhile, the treacherous and power-craving Lord Rajasena, a former city administrator of the capital city, plots to seize total control of all Asia and has amassed the greatest army in Asia. Rajasena sends out vicious assassins to murder Lord Sihadecho's family and his loyal soldiers. The only survivor from this massacre is Tien, who manages to escape with deep vengeance in his heart.  Tien is captured by a group of savage slave traders, who throw him into a pit with a giant crocodile when he proves uncontrollable. Tien is saved by Chernang ([[Sorapong Chatree]]), leader of the renowned "Pha Beek Khrut" (Garuda Wing Cliff) guerilla group, who attack the slave traders. Chernang throws a knife to Tien, proclaiming "your life depends on you, young boy," with which Tien kills the crocodile. Intrigued by his physical prowess and attitude, Chernang takes Tien to a [[Fortune-telling|soothsayer]], who says the boy has a great destiny, that "spirits will fear him" and that he will become the greatest warrior who will ever live, and as such Chernang takes in Tien as his adoptive son and raises him like himself as a guerilla and a bandit. Tien gets his wish to train as a warrior and more besides, growing up to excel in the arts of war, including man-to-man fighting, incantation, and subterfuge. Tien is instructed in a variety of traditional Asian fighting styles, including [[Muay Boran|muay boran]] and [[krabi krabong]], Japanese [[kenjutsu]] and [[ninjutsu]], Malay [[silat]], and various [[Chinese martial arts]]. He also learns the use of weapons such as the [[ninjatō]], [[katana]], [[jian]], [[dao (sword)|dao]], [[talwar]], [[nunchaku]], [[rope dart]], and [[three-section staff]].<ref name = "Review"></ref>  Now a young man and with all these martial arts heavily instilled, becoming the greatest warrior to ever live, Tien ([[Tony Jaa]]) is eager to quench the vengeance in his heart by killing the slave traders, which he does. He then goes on to kill Lord Rajasena by posing as a dancer during a celebration.  Returning to the Pha Beek Khrut, Tien is mystified to find their village deserted. Suddenly, he finds himself confronted by wave after wave of masked assassins, the same ones hired by Lord Rajasena to destroy his original home. As the fight progresses Tien is too enraged to notice that the masked villains are none other than his Pha Beek Khrut comrades though their individual combat styles are glaringly recognizable. As Tien tries to defeat the masked assassins he climbs on an elephant but then Bhuti Sangkha a.k.a. The Crow Ghost ([[Dan Chupong]] uncredited) appears and kicks Tien off of the elephant. Bhuti's nature is unknown and he has a small role in the film. Then he takes the elephant away. At last confronting their leader, Tien finds they have been surrounded by Rajasena's army, which is led by the tyrant, himself. Lord Rajasena reveals he had survived thanks to an armored tunic concealed beneath his state robes. Chernang unmasks and admits to his part in killing Lord Sihadecho, as he was in league with Rajasena. Chernang explains that he must carry out Rajasena's orders, or his family (the Pha Beek Khrut) will be killed. As Tien reluctantly fights Chernang, Chernang pins him to the ground, once again calls Tien his son and asks him to take his life in payment for killing his father. Chernang then forces Tien's blade to snap and slash across his throat, taking his life.  The film ends on a [[cliffhanger]] with Tien, after defeating dozens of Rajasena's warriors, being finally overwhelmed by hundreds more. Rajasena orders Tien to be taken away to be slowly tortured to death. It is unclear whether Tien survives, and if he does, how it is so. An extremely ambiguous and vague voice-over explains that Tien "may find a way to cheat death again", and shows him with a fully-grown beard (which he does not have in the film) standing in front of a scarred golden [[Buddha]] statue, perhaps indicating [[reincarnation]].

In that job, Rosario meets Morsa ([[Antonio de la Torre (actor)|Antonio de la Torre]]), with whom she starts a carnal relationship.  Meanwhile, Rosario lives with her mother whose physical and mental health are quickly deteriorating. One day, when Rosario arrives home from work, she discovers that her mother was going to have dinner in the bathroom.  After that, Rosario sees more strange behavior from her mother. She begins to forget important things, such as that her other daughter is married. This fact confirms for Rosario that her mother suffers from [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Rosario feels very worried and alone. She keeps finding her mother hiding in Rosario's wardrobe; on the first day that Rosario brings Morsa home from work to have sex, she watches her mother walk out of her closet, horrified. As her mother's condition worsens, Rosario calls both her sister and Milagros over to the house.  After burying Milagros's cat, Morsa, Rosario and Milagros return to Madrid to keep working. Rosario's mother is dying and her siter comes from [[Barcelona]] to stay some days with her. Rosario's sister never took any responsibility for their mother, which is motive for tension between the sisters. Rosario reproaches her sister for always being distant towards her and her mother, while her sister gets angry with Rosario for letting Milagros stay at her home. Both women remember their childhood together, talking about the funny moments and the painful ones. Soon after, their mother stops breathing.  After her mother's death, Rosario sees the image of her mother everywhere, to a point that it scares her and doesn't let her sleep. She visits the priest of the church where her mother used to go. There, she tells him her problem and he concludes that perhaps she sees the image of her mother everywhere because she didn't want her daughter to be alone.  One night whilst sweeping and washing a plaza, Milagros and Rosario are bickering over whether or not Milagros should keep some of the trash she finds when Milagros hears a baby's cry inside of a dumpster. She reaches in and discovers a baby inside a box. Rosario insists on taking the baby to a hospital emergency room, but Milagros wants to keep him at her home. They have a heated discussion where Rosario says Milagros would not be a good mother and Milagros confesses that she is sterile. Milagros says that she loved Rosario to a point that she felt jealous because she had her own life with Morsa, and that Rosario was cold and lonely and bitter, destined to be alone. Rosario finally realizes her terrible problem of loneliness and lack of confidence with other people, though she could not admit it. Days after this incident, Rosario's boss realises that Milagros had been out for a lot of time. Rosario decides to visit her, taking some flowers and chocolates. In Milagros' home, Rosario is horrified to discover that the baby Milagros took in is already dead, in an advanced state of decomposition.  Completely devastated and depressed, both women and Morsa return to the village to bury the baby in the cemetery, and Rosario recites the [[Psalm 51|51st Psalm]]. Rosario and Morsa returned to Madrid, but Milagros wants to stay, something her two friends cannot understand. Worried, Rosario says that she would be all alone with nobody beside her, but Milagros insists and decides to stay in that village for good. Some days later, Milagros is telephoned by her uncle Cosmé. He informs her that his niece has been found dead in the house of the village. This fact further devastates Rosario, who goes with Milagros's uncle to assist in the burial. During the trip to the village, Cosmé tells Rosario that his niece's mother died because of overdose when she was a little child. There, Rosario sees how her friend is buried in the cemetery, in a funeral where all the village people attended.  After the hard journey to the village, Rosario admits that she must not be alone anymore, so she decided to go to [[Fuenlabrada]], where her friend Morsa, lives. Rosario makes her way to the playground, and sees all the mothers with their children. Morsa's van stops nearby, and after a short chat, the film ends with a kiss between Morsa and Rosario.  
One Week (2008 film)
 Ben Tyler ([[Joshua Jackson]]) is a young [[elementary school]] English [[teacher]] living in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. Ben is told that he has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of [[cancer]] in its fourth and final stage.  On the way home, he encounters an elderly man [[Marc Strange]] selling his [[Norton Commando#Mk2 850 cc|1973 Norton Commando]] [[motorcycle]].  The narrator notes that Ben's fiancée Samantha Pierce ([[Liane Balaban]]) despises motorcycles, but he buys it.  Finishing a [[Tim Hortons]] coffee, he [[Roll up the Rim to Win|rolls up the cup's rim]] to see if he has won a prize, but sees only a message that reads "Go West Young Man".  He breaks the news of his cancer to Samantha, as well as his desire to take a two-day excursion on the motorcycle. She objects, arguing that he should begin treatment immediately, but he feels a need for an adventure before "becoming a patient". He asks Samantha to come with him, but she refuses, and he ultimately sets out from Toronto by himself. Early in the trip he begins to question the trip's worth, and turns back. But he encounters two young men bicycling from [[Newfoundland]] to [[Vancouver]] on a wager of a case of beer, and his adventure seems reasonable by comparison, so he resumes it.  He finds that Samantha has packed a copy of a book he had written as a child, hoping that an attached note about reading it to his children someday would persuade him to return and begin treatment. But the story, about a mythical creature called Grumps, which his father had said would bring good fortune to any child who managed to find one, strengthens his resolve to symbolically resume his search for Grumps.  Ben begins to question his future with Samantha: He recalls their discovery while planning their wedding that their religious beliefs – Ben has none – differ, and they have a telephone argument about compromises she's made for him. He meets a middle-aged man ([[Gord Downie]]) staying in the same motel, who successfully treated his cancer years before; he tells Ben that if he's unsure if he's in love, he isn't.  His motorcycle breaks down in rural [[Saskatchewan]]. Nearby, he finds a dead dog and phones its owner, a middle-aged rancher. In gratitude, she picks up him and his motorcycle, takes him on a scenic horseback ride, and fixes the minor problem with his bike. She is twice-divorced with a son and granddaughter she rarely sees, but the narrator explains that the time with Ben inspires her to seek the son out, coincidentally meeting the new "love of her life".  Continuing the trip beyond the promised two days, he arrives at [[Banff National Park]] in [[Alberta]], and checks into an expensive hotel suite. Samantha has told his family about his cancer, and is flying out to get him. He goes on what he fears will be a last adventure in the woods, where he gets lost and meets a [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacker]], Tracy ([[Emm Gryner]]) exploring the [[backcountry]] with her dog. At her campsite, she chides Ben for giving up too easily on his dreams: of a singing career quashed by a teacher's harsh remarks, and a novel which he failed to find a publisher for. Ben spends the night with her. The next morning, Samantha has arrived earlier than expected, and Ben admits to sleeping with Tracy.  He also tells Samantha that he does not love her like she loves him; she leaves him and returns home.  Ben makes his way to the west coast of [[Vancouver Island]].  At a diner, he finds himself unable to eat his meal, and meanwhile a truck hits his motorcycle in the parking lot, wrecking it.  He rents a surfboard and takes it out into the Pacific, but rather than catching a wave to ride back in, he keeps going, despondent.  He sees a [[humpback whale]] dramatically [[Whale surfacing behaviour|breach]] the surface.  Ben remembers that his father had said to him as a child that anyone who searched for Grumps would "know him when you see him"; Ben is satisfied that he has, and returns home.  He and Samantha discuss his prospects and their impending breakup, and he goes home to see his family.  The final sequence reveals the movie's narrator ([[Campbell Scott]]) recording the final chapter of an audio book, revealed to be ''One Week'' by Ben Tyler, a memoir of his motorcycle trip.  
One-Eyed Monster
 On a snow-covered mountain, a bus, truck, and a few cars arrive at a remote camp area to film a [[Pornography|porno]] film. The group is made up of professional porn actors [[Ron Jeremy]] and [[Veronica Hart]], novice porn stars Rock, Angel, Wanda, and Lance, as well as the director and producer Jim, cameraman Jonah, gaffer-electrician and sound guy T.J., and makeup and script girl Laura.  After being dropped off by the school bus driver who leaves them behind, the group settles in their living quarters for the next few days to shoot. While Laura talks with Ron about his past career days, the guys, Lance, Rock and T.J. talk about T.J.'s latest suck-and-squeeze device for carnal pleasure that T.J. wants to market, while Angel and Wanda talk about their experiences on the porn sets. Radio reports begin to describe a "strange light" in the sky that has been hovering over the mountains for the last several hours as Jim gets down to directing, starting with the first scene with Ron and Veronica. During a break in filming, Jonah goes outside to get some more lights from the truck while Ron also goes out to relieve himself. Suddenly, a strange light hits Ron, who then collapses to the ground. Jonah helps him up and they go back inside to finish filming the scene. Ron is acting strangely and begins to exhibit strange behavior as he begins performing in the sex scene with Veronica, who begin screaming in pain as Jim tries to yell "cut" as Ron continues to have rough sex with her. The guys are forced to pull Ron off Veronica as he goes into convulsions and collapses. T.J., Jeff, and Jonah try to help Veronica, who begins hemorrhaging and loses consciousness. They guys look over to help Ron and see that he is dead. But they also notice that Ron's legendary 9 3/4-inch [[penis]] is gone as well.  In Angel's room, she is rehearsing her upcoming scene, when the disembodied penis attacks her. Wanda walks in on this and runs out to inform Rock, Lance and Laura who run in only to find the disembodied member gone and Angel dead, with a large and gory hole in the back of her head. While everyone runs out to tell the others, Laura has an encounter with the disembodied penis which attacks her.  Holing themselves up in the main cabin, Jonah, Jim, T.J., Lance, Rock, and Wanda try to make sense of what is going on, just when Laura walks in, acting strangely. After the guys carry Ron's dead body outside, they debate on what to do since they are stranded there and no one has any signal for their cell phones. Rock wants to make a run for the cars to try to get off the mountain, but when he runs outside, the disembodied penis appears and shoves itself through him. When Jonah and T.J. run outside in a futile attempt to save him, they are surprised by the appearance of a rugged mountain man, named Montz who brings them back inside to the main cabin.  Resting, Jonah and T.J. make the assumption that Ron's missing penis is possessed by some kind of alien force. Jeff suggests finding a way to kill it while Laura, who continues acting strangely, wants to capture it. Lance and Wanda retreat to a nearby bathroom where he tries to calm down the growing hysterical Wanda over this unbelievable turn of events. Just then, the severed penis slithers in through a crack in the bathroom window and attacks them both.  Jonah and T.J. come up with a plan to capture the lethal creature by luring it through an open window, using a pair of women's panties borrowed from Laura, to try to trap it with Jeff's suck and squeeze device. Montz volunteers to kill it after he gives them a creepy but hilarious monologue about his encounter with a similar event back in Vietnam in the 1960s where he saw his platoon getting killed by a disembodied penis that came from the body of his commanding officer. T.J. volunteers to help out and has Jonah lock him and Montz in the kitchen to make sure that if they fail that Rock's penis will not be able to get them. But while their backs are turned, the disembodied penis slithers into the kitchen and strangles Montz to death, while it shoves itself with rapid speed through T.J., killing him.  Jim panics and runs into the nearby bathroom only to find a dead and cocooned Lance and Wanda against the wall. Panicking, he runs outside to the nearby barn and tries to start a snow speeder to try to escape. But the severed penis follows him in a super-fast chase down the mountain where it knocks him off his snow speeder and then gruesomely slices him in two from the crotch to the top of the head as it burrows through the snow.  Back at the main cabin, the three survivors, Jonah, Laura, and the barely conscious Veronica, are beside themselves and wait. Jonah, after being told earlier by Montz about the location of an old radio antenna atop the nearby mountain, suggests they run to a nearby cabin that Montz told them about where there is an underground passageway to the radio shack where they can radio for help. With Veronica having regained some of her strength, they make it to the passageway, which is apparently an old mine shaft, and walk through the long tunnel and make it to the radio shack where Jonah tries to get the radio to work, only the severed penis follows them and lands on Laura. Jonah tries to swing at it with an axe, but the "thing" is much too fast and keeps evading his blows. Veronica then thinks of a way to fight it. She lies down on the floor and offers herself to the entity which shoves itself between her legs. Veronica tells Jonah and Laura to run for safety as she will keep it occupied and uses her vaginal muscles to drain it of its power. Jonah and Laura flee from the radio shack cabin and down the mountain just as Veronica makes the severed dick climax.  The penis monster explodes in a massive blast, destroying itself as well as killing Veronica and blows up the radio cabin in a massive blast covering the sky with millions of particles.  Jonah and Laura seek shelter in a nearby shack where they huddle for the night. At dawn, Laura hears sounds of rain, but Jonah tells her that the rain is "Ron". The remains of the penis monster are raining down [[semen]] on the entire area.  At dawn, when the sounds had stopped, Laura leaves the cabin and a sleeping Jonah, where she ventures outside and to a place in the snow where she seems to be distraught over the death of the one-eyed monster. Laura reveals a massive bulge in her abdomen as she is now impregnated by the penis monster which attacked her earlier and will now be the apparent breeding chamber to the one-eye monster's offspring.

But Elliot has new emotions about his marriage and feels reluctant to marry Giselle. Mr. Weenie ([[Cody Cameron]]) finds a dog biscuit trail that his previous owners left behind and uncontrollably follows it. At the climax of the wedding, Elliot witnesses Mr. Weenie being taken away by his old owners, Bob and Bobbie ([[Georgia Engel]]). Elliot tells an exaggerated story to the other forest animals (in order to get out of marrying Giselle) and decides to make a rescue mission to save him. The other ones that go on Elliot's rescue mission are Boog, Giselle, squirrel McSquizzy ([[Billy Connolly]]), Buddy the porcupine, ([[Matthew W. Taylor]]), and ducks Serge ([[Danny Mann]]) and Deni (Matthew W. Taylor).  Meanwhile, the other pets meet. There is Fifi ([[Crispin Glover]]), a toy poodle and his basset hound companion Roberto ([[Steve Schirripa]]), two cats named Stanley ([[Fred Stoller]]) and Roger (Sean Mullen), and Southern dogs named Rufus ([[Diedrich Bader]]), and Charlene ([[Olivia Hack]]). Fifi discusses his hatred for wild animals as one night he goes into the bushes to retrieve his chew toy and is "traumatized" by the wild animals inside, and accidentally gets his tail zapped by the bug lighter. He then tries to maul a nearby rabbit, until he's stopped by his owner. Meanwhile, the wilds find Weenie, much to Elliot's dismay, who does not want to marry Giselle. They try to free him while his owners are in a gas station. They free him from his chains, but accidentally leave him stuck in the RV along with Buddy. Elliot and Giselle get in a feud, and eventually leaves Elliot to search for Mr. Weenie himself, while Serge and Deni fly to look for him.  The owners reach the pet camp with Mr. Weenie and a stowed away Buddy. The other pets meet with Weenie, and Fifi tries to revert Weenie back into his pet state, but Weenie resists. Buddy helps Weenie escape and Buddy tries to free Weenie from his shock collar. During the chase, Fifi gets shocked by the collar and gets the fur on his forehead burned, causing him to lose most of his sanity and vow revenge.  Meanwhile, Serge and Deni return and explain they found Weenie and Buddy at a pet camp, which they already escaped from. Boog and the others set camp, and Boog fails to convince Giselle that Elliot is a good person and that they belong together. Elliot, meanwhile, is having a horrible time, following his own tracks that he confuses for Mr. Weenie's and gets his head stuck on a trash can lid all the while missing his friends. The wilds reach the pet camp, but the pets and their owners have already left, but realizes that they have gone to a resort called "Pet Paradiso", a vacation spot for pets.

Giselle and McSquizzy walk around Pet Paradiso looking for Mr. Weenie, but their cover is blown and are kidnapped by Fifi and the other pets and taken to their secret lair. Elliot, Buddy and Mr. Weenie attempt to go inside to save Giselle and McSquizzy, but Mr. Weenie, missing being a pet again, goes to play on a waterslide, leaving the rest to be captured by Fifi.   Fifi tries to kill them all with a pile of shock collars. As Boog tries to stop Mr. Weenie from going down the waterslide, his cover is blown as well and security attempts to [[tranquilize]] him. Before Fifi shocks the wilds into [[submission]], Elliot tries to profess his love for Giselle. As Fifi is about to kill them, Boog, via the waterslide, enters the pets' lair, and the water from the waterslide forces everyone out of the lair.  A battle between the wilds and pets ensues, with the Pet Paradiso security focused on tranquilizing the wilds. While Boog tricks security into tranquilizing themselves, Elliot saves Giselle, accidentally placing all the shock collars on himself. He wrestles Fifi in the pool for the shock collar remote; Fifi eventually grabs the remote and activates the collars, but then realizes that Elliot put all the collars on him. Fifi survives, but the electricity caused him to lose all his fur, humiliating him. The pets and the wilds settle their differences and decide to become friends. Mr. Weenie, wanting to be a pet again, decides to join the pets and returns to his owners in rejoice. Elliot finally professes his true feelings for Giselle, and they get married.

As she struggles to gently disengage without hurting her family, announcing to her betrothed's family that she must develop as a person, her once-future father in law calls her a rude name. Amazingly, her father forcefully stands up for her, points out that whenever she enters a room, people smile, and that he loves her.  Granger, too, feels something is missing. While giving the traditional Best Man's Toast at a wedding, he quotes the groom, his childhood best friend:  "Nothing should ever hold a man back from his future." Shocked speechless before finishing the toast, he realizes what he may still be able to save. He rushes to the airport, furiously calling the bank in Mumbai with the help of a Hindi-speaking cab driver.  Priya has thrown herself back into her work, accepting a promotion to help her coworkers become as effective as she is channeling American attitudes and accent. Just as she is counseling a young man to control his emotions to better serve the bank and its customers, Granger strides into Priya's call center and cautiously declares his devotion. With a hundred eyes on the couple, a coworker coaxes, "Kiss him! Kiss him!" They kiss for the first time to the cheers of her crew.  After her shift, as morning breaks, the apprehensive couple finds her family enjoying an open-air breakfast in their sun-dappled garden. Granger bravely attempts to win the approval of Priya's father by promising to honor her and her culture in phonetic but crude Hindi.  Granger formally repeats his commitment to respect and care for her. Father thinks it over for a few moments as the family watches him intently, and he graciously accepts the young man, welcoming him to breakfast.

The Other Man (2008 film)
 In Cambridge, Lisa (Linney) is a shoe designer, happily married for the last 25 years to Peter (Neeson), a software CEO. They have a daughter, Abigail ([[Romola Garai]]). Lisa frequently travels to [[Milan]] to do business with the Gianni & Gianni Company.   After Lisa dies, Peter is rooting around his house in an attempt to rid himself of Lisa's stuff and help deal with the grief. Abigail takes one of her mother's shoes and pulls a piece of paper out of it, saying it was for Peter to find. On the paper is written "Lake Como". Soon after this, Peter finds a strange message on her cell phone from a man, wishing only to hear Lisa's voice. It creates a tension in the mind of Peter. When he checks her e-mails he finds several similar requests from "Ralph". He also finds on her computer a folder named "Love", which is password protected. It creates a strong suspicion in his mind that she has had a secret affair and that her lover is mailing her now. He tries to open the folder by guessing the password, but in vain.   Peter wrongly accuses one of Lisa's co-workers named Ralph of being her lover. He replies to the mails of Ralph pretending to be Lisa. He asks one of his co-workers to find out the real name and location of the sender of these e-mails by tracing his IP address through his email address. His co-worker tells him that Ralph has an address in Milan. Peter continues to try to access the "Love" folder on Lisa's computer, and becomes increasingly frustrated. When he types "Lake Como" as the password, the folder opens. It contains many photos of her with a man in intimate moments and near [[Lake Como]].  In order to find out more about his wife's lover, he locates and secretly follows Ralph (Banderas) in Milan. He then goes to a café, one of Ralph's haunts, and begins to play chess alone. Ralph (pronounced "Rafe" he learns) engages him in conversation, and they begin to play chess and talk. Ralph easily speaks about Lisa and their relationship, unaware that Peter is Lisa's husband. Ralph tells him that it is he who has suggested she start a shoe designing business after perceiving her unique understanding of shoes and her passion towards different new designs, which the industry lacks. Over a period of time, they play several games of chess and, as far as Ralph is concerned, have a friendship.  Abigail learns of her mother's affair, while listening to her mother's voicemail, and deduces her father's frightening obsession with vengeance. She goes to Milan and tries to convince her father to stop hunting for Lisa’s lover as she had already gone, as well as to accept her partner George (who is a scruffy musician). She also warns him that his craziness will lead him to lose everything, including his daughter, career and friends.   Peter becomes greatly upset and he goes uninvited, with murderous intent, to Ralph's apartment. There, to his surprise, he learns that Ralph is not the cosmopolitan man of the world as he has been portraying himself, but an impoverished janitor. Peter's hate diminishes, but not his urge to avenge. He sends an e-mail, as Lisa, to Ralph, asking that he meet her at Lake Como. Ralph tells Peter about his upcoming meeting, and Peter gives him money to enable the meeting. Ralph also plans to throw a party for Lisa in London, as he sees this latest meeting as a sign that their relationship is taking off.  Ralph goes to Lake Como, but instead of finding Lisa there, Ralph finds Peter waiting for him. Peter reveals to Ralph that he was Lisa's husband, and that Lisa is actually dead. Ralph tells Peter that Lisa had known about his humble background and helped him financially on several occasions. He also forces Peter to confront that it is his excessive devotion for his work and cold nature towards marital life, which had moved Lisa to seek warmth in Ralph's arms, but still loving Peter so much that she never was ready to leave him, in spite of cheating with Ralph. Throughout this conversation, it is shown through flashbacks that Lisa died of cancer, and that she did not tell Peter about it until 'it was too late'.   It is then revealed in flashback that when Lisa was critically ill and about to die, she wrote something on a piece of paper and asked her daughter to put it in one of her red shoes so that one day Peter would find it. Lisa instructs Abigail not to tell him about the note, and assures her that he will definitely look for it and find it on his own one day. This is the piece of paper with "Lake Como" on it seen earlier.  When Ralph had asked her to tell Peter about their affair, end their marriage and move in with him, Lisa refused, saying that she did not want to hurt Peter and make him endure the pain of separation. She promised to reveal her dark secret to Peter at the appropriate time in her life so that he can forgive her for her infidelity. Peter and Ralph part, with Peter seemingly more bitter and upset than ever.  Ralph has arranged a dinner in Lisa's memory, and at first, Peter refuses to go. However, he realizes that "forgiveness and love need to replace hate", and arranges to be at the dinner with Abigail and her partner. Traveling home after the dinner, we see Peter reconciled with George.  
Outlander (film)
 A spacecraft crashes in a lake in [[Vendel Period|Vendel]]-era [[Scandinavia]]. The only surviving occupant &ndash; a human &ndash; retrieves a distress beacon and a computer which explains that he is on Earth, a "seed" colony that his people have abandoned.  The computer downloads the local [[Proto-Norse language|Norse]] language and culture directly into his brain. The spaceman soon finds a freshly destroyed village, where he is captured by Wulfric ([[Jack Huston]]), a warrior from another village.  Wulfric takes him to the fortified village of King [[Hrothgar|Rothgar]] ([[John Hurt]]), father of Freya ([[Sophia Myles]]), who he hopes will marry future king Wulfric. Rothgar is concerned that Gunnar ([[Ron Perlman]]), chieftain of the destroyed village, will assume it was Wulfric's doing, as Wulfric's father (Rothgar's predecessor) had been killed by Gunnar. Wulfric interrogates the "outlander", who identifies himself as Kainan ([[Jim Caviezel]]), claiming he is from the north, and states that he is hunting a dragon. The village is attacked that night by an unseen creature, which kills several men. Kainan identifies it as a "Moorwen", a predatory creature which caused his ship to crash and now will hunt men and animals alike. When Kainan is taken with a hunting party to find the Moorwen, he kills a gigantic bear that had slain some of the hunters, proving himself to the others who begin treating him as a part of their tribe.  Gunnar and his men attack the settlement, retreating after casualties on both sides. They soon return, pursued by the Moorwen, and enter the safety of the village. Kainan devises a plan to build a huge pit just inside the village entrance, fill it with whale oil and leave wooden shields floating on the surface.  Freya becomes increasingly attracted to Kainan. He explains to her the Moorwen's origin&mdash;Kainan's people invaded its land (planet), slaughtered it in the billions and built a colony there. This Moorwen, now the last of its kind, massacred everyone in the colony, including Kainan's wife and child. When his "ship" returned to the colony, the Moorwen snuck onboard and later caused the crash. After listening to Kainan's tale, Freya gives him a family sword, saying she was told that she would know what man to give it to.  Kainan and Wulfric lure the Moorwen to the village. They cross the oil pit by running on the shields, but the Moorwen falls into the pit, and the oil is set on fire. The Moorwen bursts out, kills several people, then escapes. Meanwhile, an offspring of the Moorwen sneaks into the hall where the women and children are hiding. Eric, the orphaned boy that Kainan has begun looking after, alerts Rothgar, who is killed as the women and children escape. Kainan realizes that they need stronger weapons to kill the Moorwen. Kainan, Freya, and the newly-crowned King Wulfric return to the lake to retrieve fragments of metal from Kainan's submerged ship. While Kainan is underwater, the young Moorwen attacks the boat, taking Freya. Kainan and Wulfric return to the village, where the fragments are soon forged into weapons before descending into the Moorwens' lair.  Freya awakens on a pile of bodies in the underground lair. As the young Moorwen moves toward Freya, it is distracted by the sound of Kainan's hunting party. Many of the hunters are killed, but the young Moorwen is blinded by Boromir. When it returns to attack Freya, Kainan and Wulfric pass one of the new swords, with which she slays the young Moorwen. The cave exits to a high waterfall, where the adult Moorwen attacks. It seriously wounds Wulfric before Kainan engages it in battle.  When Freya joins in, Kainan is able to knock the Moorwen over the cliff's edge to its death. Freya and Kainan return to Wulfric's side, where he passes the kingship to Kainan just before he dies.  Kainan tells Freya to wait for the rest of the warriors, while he heads back to the lake. Night falls as Kainan retrieves some items from his ship, says goodbye to his wife's submerged coffin, then destroys his distress beacon just as Freya sees a rescue spaceship approaching, leading her to believe that Kainan was sent by the [[Asgard|gods]]. The rescue ship departs without Kainan, who stays as king, weds Freya and they adopt Eric.  
Outpost (2008 film)
 In a seedy bar in a town ravaged by war, scientist and businessman Hunt ([[Julian Wadham]]) hires former [[Royal Marine]] turned mercenary D.C. ([[Ray Stevenson]]) to assemble a crack team of ex-soldiers – Prior ([[Richard Brake]]), Jordan (Paul Blair), Cotter (Enoch Frost), Voytech (Julian Rivett), McKay ([[Michael Smiley]]) and Taktarov ([[Brett Fancy]]) – to protect him on a dangerous journey into no-man's land. Their mission is to scope out an old military bunker in [[Eastern Europe]].  Once at the outpost, the men make a horrific discovery that changes the dynamics of the entire mission: the scene of a bloody and gruesome series of [[Die Glocke|occultistic Nazi experiments]], carried out by the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] during [[World War II]], using [[Plane (esotericism)|reality shifting]] and [[Undead|reanimation]] to create invincible soldiers. Amidst the carnage, they find a survivor, Götz ([[Johnny Meres]]).  At night, the clearing around the bunker is suddenly lit, and silhouettes of people are seen against the light. Soon after, Taktarov is gruesomely killed by an unseen foe. Later the same night Voyteche is killed by two Nazis. The next morning,  Voyteche and Taktarov's dead bodies are found joined at the head, with Taktarov's skull containing a spent round. D.C. demands answers regarding the assignment from Hunt: an unnamed corporation wanted Hunt to find and recover a large generator-like device responsible for the SS's reality-shifting experiments. D.C. orders Cotter to retrieve Hunt from the generator room. While trying to convince Hunt to leave, Cotter is killed by an SS soldier with a pickaxe. It is revealed that Götz is actually a surviving SS [[Brigadeführer|brigadier general]] – a "breather." When Prior kills Götz, the "breather" comes back to life and MacKay is killed. The mercenaries and Hunt attempt to evacuate the outpost, only to be slaughtered by the undead SS battalion.  A second corporate team arrives 72 hours later to carry out the same assignment, only to find a "breather" among the piles of naked corpses.  The clearing is lit again, revealing the illuminated soldiers surrounding the bunker. In the distance stands the brigadier general, who gives the SS soldiers a nod, and they begin their assault on the team.  
Our Last Days as Children
 ''Our Last Days As Children'' is a story about all that makes us human. It examines how everyday people are affected by an ideology of intolerance and how one may deal with the consequences of a worst-case scenario against their own will. It is a heartfelt, but disturbing, story showing the lives of individuals who are singled out and ill-treated by the people that represent them. Although laws are put in place to ensure toleration, when the rules change identities are destroyed. This shocking truth is concealed behind the advancement of science and through the act of medical and technological progression.  
Over Her Dead Body
 Kate and Henry are a happy couple. Henry proposed to Kate and they are about to be married, but on the day of their wedding, Kate is accidentally killed by an ice sculpture angel, because of the actions of an ice sculptor (Stephen Root). Unaware that she has died and her soul left her body, Kate awakens in [[Purgatory]], and wastes precious time arguing with an angel who finally leaves before she can explain to Kate what she must do to move on.  A year later, Henry's sister Chloe ([[Lindsay Sloane]]) hopes that he will find closure by consulting Ashley ([[Lake Bell]]), a [[psychic]] who also runs a catering business with her gay best friend Dan ([[Jason Biggs]]). After an unsuccessful first meeting, Chloe gives Kate's diary to Ashley so that she can pretend to communicate with Kate and convince Henry to move on with his life. In the process, Henry and Ashley fall for each other... much to the consternation of Kate, who has been watching over Henry. When Kate voices her displeasure, Ashley hears her, unaware of what it means.  Angry over Ashley's deception and uncertain of what she is supposed to do, Kate later encounters the ice sculptor, and discovers that he is also a ghost (a result of a drunk driving accident). He explains to her that they must deal with their unfinished business. Believing that her job is to protect Henry, Kate proceeds to harass Ashley (who is the only one who can see or hear Kate). Using her ghostly abilities of intangibility, levitation, and auditory hallucination, Kate hopes to force Ashley to break up with Henry. Ashley persists, but then Henry discovers the fraud with the diary and breaks off the relationship. Despondent over the break-up, Ashley turns to Dan for solace, but is further distraught when Dan reveals that he is not gay and has secretly been in love with her for years. Over time, Ashley and Dan eventually reconcile.  After several months of watching Henry fall back into a depressed funk, Kate encounters the sculptor once more, who points out that if she had resolved her unfinished business, she would have moved on to [[Heaven]] by now. When the sculptor asks her what she really wants, Kate reluctantly admits that she only wants Henry to be happy... and realizes that he could be happy with Ashley. Then the sculptor reveals that Kate was ''his'' unfinished business and he had to get her to do the right thing before moving on, which he does. Kate first attempts to convince Ashley to get back together with Henry but Ashley doesn't believe her change of heart, and is preparing to fly to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] with Dan. In desperation, Kate finds she is able to talk to Henry through his pet parrot and gets him to meet Ashley at the airport. Realizing that Henry has forgiven her and that she has Kate's blessing, Ashley joyfully embraces with Henry. At their wedding, Ashley delays her walk down the aisle to sit briefly in the back pew, to promise Kate that she will strive to make Henry happy. Also at the wedding, Dan makes a new connection with Chloe. Now ready to move on, Kate arrives once more in Purgatory, congratulated for her efforts by the angel and requests the "orb of true light" collected from Kate's loved ones. The angel leaves once again, leaving Kate in Purgatory.

Our School's E.T.
 Chun Sung-geun is the gym teacher of a private high school in an upscale district where competition is heated among students to enter top colleges. Called "[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]" by his students because of his quirky appearance and behavior, he is a teacher who has lived life his own lazy, ignorant way for years without any worries. But one day he's hit with a crisis: At the school's board meeting, a parent requests that the school get rid of "useless" gym classes and expand the hours for [[English language|English]] classes. The school decides to hire another English teacher—at the cost of a gym teacher. In danger of losing his position, he remembers by chance that he obtained a license to teach English a decade ago. The school board president tells him to pass a test in order for her to acknowledge it. So Sung-geun, who hasn't spoken (much less taught) English for ten years, faces the near-impossible task of becoming an English teacher within two weeks. His only weapon is his amazingly incomparable physical strength, and with the help of a few students who understand his warm heart, the simpleton Sung-geun begins his rigorous training to exercise his brain "muscles" to master English in his journey to become the school's E.T.  
The Oxford Murders (film)
 [[File:CastRoom VictoriaAndAlbertMuseum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[plaster cast]] of [[Trajan's Column]] at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria and Albert]] is discussed in the film.]] In 1993, Martin ([[Elijah Wood]]), a US student at the [[University of Oxford]], wants Arthur Seldom ([[John Hurt]]) as his [[Dissertation|thesis supervisor]]. He idolises Seldom and has learned all about him. He takes accommodation in Oxford at the house of Mrs. Eagleton ([[Anna Massey]]), an old friend of Seldom. Also in the house is her daughter, Beth ([[Julie Cox]]), who is her full-time caregiver – which she resents bitterly – and a musician by occupation.   In a public lecture, Seldom quotes [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's]] ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]]'' to deny the possibility of absolute truth. Hoping to impress his idol, Martin disputes this, asserting his faith in the absolute truth of mathematics: "I believe in the number [[pi]]". Seldom humiliates him, ridiculing his arguments and making him look foolish in front of the audience. Disillusioned, Martin decides to abandon his studies and goes to his office to collect his belongings. There, he encounters his office-mate, a bitter mathematician Podorov ([[Burn Gorman]]), who also failed to become a student of Seldom's.  Martin then returns to his residence, where he finds Seldom arriving to visit Mrs. Eagleton. The two men enter the house together and find Martin's landlady murdered. Seldom tells the police that he had received a note with his friend's address marked as "the first of a series". As Seldom is an authority on logical series, he argues that a serial killer is using murder as a way to challenge his intelligence. According to Seldom, "The only perfect crime that exists is not the one that remains unsolved, but the one which is solved with the wrong culprit."<ref>[http://riskybusiness.hollywoodreporter.com/2010/06/28/trailer-elijah-wood-in-the-oxford-murders-video/ "Elijah wood in 'The Oxford Murders',"] ''The Hollywood Reporter''. 28 June 2010; the credit for coining this clever phrase, which was highlighted in the trailer, goes to Guillermo Martinez</ref>    Martin and Seldom discuss how easily the murder of the old lady might have been overlooked, particularly as she already suffered from terminal cancer. Martin suggests that the murderer is committing "imperceptible murders", meaning that the killer is choosing victims who are already dying therefore meaning that the police would be less likely to suspect foul play.  Martin goes to the hospital where his girlfriend Lorna ([[Leonor Watling]]) works. There he meets a religious fanatic ([[Dominique Pinon]]), who has a daughter in dire need of a lung transplant. He also runs into Seldom, who is visiting Kalman ([[Alex Cox]]), a former student who went mad and suffers from a debilitating cancer, with bone involvement. Soon after, the patient who shares the room with Seldom's friend dies of an apparent lethal injection and the authorities receive a second symbol: two interlocking arcs.    Martin and Lorna's relationship becomes strained as he becomes more obsessed with Seldom and the murders and discovers that Lorna had once been Seldom's lover. At a [[Guy Fawkes Night]] concert, Martin sees Podorov acting suspiciously and the police give chase, only to discover that Podorov had merely intended to hang an insulting banner from the school roof. While they are distracted a member of the orchestra collapses and dies from respiratory failure. A drawing of a triangle is found on his music stand. Afterwards, Seldom tells Martin a story about a nineteenth century man who had written a diary listing ways to kill his wife. When the wife discovered the diary she killed her husband but was acquitted by a jury on grounds of self-defense. Decades later, the diary was discovered to have been forged by the woman's lover. Seldom uses this story to explain that the perfect crime is not one which is never solved, but one which is solved incorrectly.    All of Oxford's mathematics community is excited as a local researcher claims to have solved [[Fermat's last theorem]]. The mathematicians, including Seldom and Martin, board a bus to head to the conference, but Martin jumps out after seeing Lorna passing on the street. The two reconcile and agree to take a long vacation away from Oxford, mathematics, and Seldom. After making love with Lorna, Martin realises that the sequence the killer has sent them all consist of Pythagorean symbols and that the fourth one will be a [[tetractys]], consisting of ten points.  The police, thinking that the killer is obsessed with Seldom, believe that he means to target the bus which Seldom and the other mathematicians are on. However, the killer, as Martin realises, is actually the man he had met at the hospital. The man is a bus driver for a school for developmentally disabled children. Seeing the students as unfit to live and wanting to provide organ donors to save his own daughter's life, he blows up his bus, killing the children inside and himself. Afterwards, the police theorise that he had planned to escape the blast alive and had committed the other murders to present the deaths of the schoolchildren as the work of a serial killer, thus shifting blame from himself.  Afterwards, Lorna and Martin prepare to leave Oxford. However, Martin realises that Seldom has been lying to him the entire time. As Lorna leaves in disgust, Martin travels to meet Seldom. He explains what he has figured out.  Beth, wanting to be relieved of the responsibility of caring for her mother, had murdered the old woman as the police had initially suspected. In a panic, she had called Seldom, who came over to help cover up the crime. But Seldom arrived just as Martin did and so could not clean up the crime scene. Instead, he invented the story about receiving a note from the killer to throw suspicion off of Beth. The man at the hospital had died of natural causes with Seldom merely creating a fake injection mark and leaving a symbol behind. The death of the musician at the concert was a fortuitous accident which Seldom took advantage of.  Seldom argues that while he did indeed lie, his actions resulted in no deaths. However, Martin points out that the bus bomber took his inspiration from Seldom's string of murders. Seldom counters that all actions have unintended consequences and that Martin's flirtations with Beth had led to her murdering her mother.

Peirong becomes suspicious of Xiaowei after a diviner told her that Xiaowei is actually a demon and after she accidentally cut Xiaowei but Xiaowei showed no sign of bleeding. Peirong approaches Pang Yong for help. In the meantime, Pang Yong meets Xia Bing, a young and inexperienced demon hunter, and befriends her. The murders were actually committed by Xiaoyi, a chameleon spirit who shows unrequited love towards Xiaowei and helps her obtain the human hearts she needs. Xiaoyi fought with Pang Yong and the soldiers on a few occasions and was nearly captured by Pang Yong but he always managed to escape. At the same time, Pang Yong and Xia Bing come to Wang Sheng's house and accuse Xiaowei of being a demon, but Xiaowei succeeds in maintaining her disguise, much to the ire of Peirong and Xia Bing.  When Xiaowei gets closer to Wang Sheng, Xiaoyi turns jealous and attacks Wang, but is driven away. When Xiaoyi meets Xiaowei again later, she is so furious that she shouts at him to leave, despite him warning her that love between demons and humans is impossible and pleading her to allow him to remain by her side. One night, Peirong's suspicions about Xiaowei are confirmed when she chances upon Xiaowei peeling off her human skin right in front of her and revealing her true form. Peirong and Xiaowei come to an agreement: Xiaowei promises to stop killing people; in return, Peirong offers her place as Wang Sheng's rightful spouse to Xiaowei and takes the blame for the murders. Xiaowei gives Peirong a potion to drink, after which Peirong's hair turns white and her features become "demonic". The city's residents are horrified when they see Peirong and think that she is the demon. Just as Peirong is about to be killed by the citizens, Pang Yong and Xia Bing show up, save her, and bring her to a cave.  Pang Yong and Xia Bing deduce that Peirong has been poisoned by the demon and she is close to death because the lighter the colour of the poison, the more fatal it is. Peirong is gradually turning white. Not long later, Wang Sheng, his soldiers and members of his household (including Xiaowei) come to the cave. Wang Sheng swears to kill Peirong if she is really a demon and is responsible for all the murders, but also expresses his love for her at the same time. Peirong then impales herself with a dagger Wang is holding on to and dies in his arms. Xiaowei tries to gain Wang Sheng's affection by moving closer to him, but he takes no notice of her and continues to weep while holding on to his dead wife's body. At this point, Xiaowei realises that Wang Sheng will never truly love her.  Pang Yong shouts to everyone that Xiaowei is the real demon and then slashes her with his weapon to prove it, but her body is as hard as steel. Wang Sheng approaches Xiaowei and begs her to bring Peirong back to life. When Xiaowei asks him what she will get if she restores Peirong to life, Wang replies that he loves her but he already has Peirong, and then kills himself. The heartbroken Xiaowei screams and reveals her true demon form. She then willingly attempts to bring Wang back to life with her magic powers in the form of a small orb. However, before she can do so, she is interrupted by Xiaoyi, who snatches away the orb and reprimands her for sacrificing all the powers she cultivated over thousands of years to save a man's life. He swallows the orb and tells her he is going to bring her home. Pang Yong and Xia Bing fight with Xiaoyi and eventually slay him but he kills Pang in the process. Xiaowei retrieves the orb from Xiaoyi's body and another orb containing Xiaoyi's powers, and uses them to bring every dead person in the cave back to life.  Before the film ends, Xiaowei is shown manifested in her white fox form without her powers because she has already given them up to bring Peirong and Wang Sheng back to life.

David Mann ([[Joe Dinicol]]) is Sarah's younger brother, ineligible for military service due to [[asthma]] but determined to enlist. The Mann's are ostracized when it becomes known their father died at Vimy Ridge when with the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]].  The father of David's girlfriend pulls strings to allow him to enlist. Dunne feels responsible for David's wellbeing and reenlists as a private under his mother's maiden name McCrae.  David and Michael end up in the battlefields of [[Belgium]]. Sarah also enlists and follows the 10th as a nurse in [[triage]] at an Advanced Dressing Station near the front. The three arrive in [[Flanders]] in time for the [[Battle of Passchendaele]]. Dunne and Sarah soon meet up again when Dunne brings a wounded man to the aid station. Dunne's cover as McCrae is soon blown, he manages to escape punishment and is promoted to platoon leader by Lieutenant Colonel Ormond, who knew him from earlier combat, when his past actions "should have got a [[Victoria Cross|V.C.]]" and because of the need for experienced soldiers as high casualties were expected.  When the Canadians launch their attack, the 8th Battalion ([[Royal Winnipeg Rifles|Winnipeg Rifles]]), known as the Little Black Devils, faces a German counterattack and become pinned down. Dunne's company is sent to support them. After the support company arrives, the 8th Battalion retreats from the battlefield, wrongly believing that they are finally relieved, leaving the job of holding the ground to Dunne's small force. As the reality of the war begins to set in, David Mann begins to realize the war was not what he believed it would be. Dunne's forces spend the night in their trenches, and as a result of the shelling, David begins to have an asthmatic/panic attack and Dunne calms him down, relieving the problem.  The next morning the Germans counter-attack, and make it as far as the line, and both forces attack each other in [[Close combat|close quarters combat]]. As the Germans retreat, David breaks down and chases them back to surrender. He jumps into their trenches and is met by a gun to the face where he begs in German. He is about to be shot when an artillery shell lands and the explosion throws him onto what is effectively a cross, created by walkway timbers from the trench. He is visually crucified by the explosion. This relates to Dunne's earlier story of the legendary report of [[The Crucified Soldier|the crucified soldier]]. When Dunne sees this he takes his helmet off, throws his gun down and runs to David, in a reckless attempt to keep his promise to keep him alive, getting shot in the process. He crawls to the cross on his knees, looking up at it. The Germans stop firing and allow him to retrieve David, whom he carries back to his own lines. The fighting swiftly resumes with a shell landing. David lives, but Dunne is carried to the hospital where he dies after his last words with Sarah. This happens just as the news comes in that the Canadians have captured [[Passchendaele Ridge]].  The ending scene shows David Mann, who now has only one leg and uses a wheelchair; Sarah Mann; David's girlfriend Cassie; and Dunne's best friend Royster ([[Gil Bellows]]) paying tribute at Dunne's grave on his home farm. The marker has been altered to remove the "5" of 1915 and changed to 1917. The camera then pans out and the background alters to a field of hundreds of Canadian war graves with a riderless horse on the horizon.  
Passengers (2008 film)
  Psychotherapist Claire Summers is called upon by her supervisor, Perry Jackson, to treat a group of five survivors of a recent plane crash; passengers Dean, Norman, Shannon, Eric, and flight attendant Janice. Claire talks to Eric in the hospital, who seems unusually upbeat. When Claire holds a counselling session for the survivors (except Eric, who decided not to come), she receives different recounts, with some not even remembering certain parts of the crash. Afterwards, Claire meets up with Mr. Arkin, who is seemingly an official from the airline to confirm which parts of their recounts are true. He however dismisses her, claiming that the crash was the pilot's fault. She then proceeds to Eric's home for a private counselling, with Eric becoming attracted to her. Claire becomes suspicious of him when he reveals personal information about her, including how he knows what type of coffee she likes and asking whether she has a sister.  At the next session, Dean does not show up, concerning Claire. Afterwards, Norman then carpools with her and shares his theory about how he suspects the airline is targeting them to cover up a mechanical failure in the plane. In the meantime, Eric becomes increasingly friendly towards Claire, with him even giving her a spare key to his house. Back in her apartment, Claire is divided between her job and her feelings for Eric. Her kind neighbor advises her to take the chance before it disappears because in life, moments like this are here one minute and gone the next.  Norman fails to attend the next counselling, leaving only Janice and Shannon. Mr. Arkin shows up and warns Claire to make sure she is not feeding the survivors her theories about the plane crash. Claire spends the rest of the day with Eric, including a small trip outside the harbor in his boat, where she gives in to Eric's advances. Back at her place with Eric, she confesses to him that she and her sister Emma haven't spoken to each other in months because she called Claire a coward and that she was wasting her life away. She goes to Emma's house to make peace with her the next day, but nobody answers her. Claire then meets a man who claims he was a survivor of the plane crash and begs her to help him. When she takes him to the airport to meet Mr. Arkin, the man recognizes him and angrily blames him for the crash. Mr. Arkin, however, claims he has nothing to do with it. In the next moment, the man disappears from the scene which confuses Claire, but then she realizes she is late for the counselling session.  Eric returns to the site of the plane crash and has frightening memories about it. Meanwhile, it is shown that Shannon is now the only one attending the session and she runs into Claire after seeing a mysterious couple outside the building. Eric runs into them and Claire takes them back to her apartment for the night. Eric then becomes convinced that he didn't survive the crash and attempts to commit suicide by standing in front of a train. When it seemingly fails, he angrily tells Claire to leave him alone. Distressed, she returns home only to find that Shannon has disappeared. Her neighbor tells her that she left with a man and woman, shocking Claire. She then goes to see her supervisor who is convinced she is just latched on to some elaborate theory to cover up what really happened during the crash. Frustrated, Claire returns to Emma's house where she meets Mr. Arkin. He tearfully explains the pilot of the plane was tired because he was in the middle of a divorce and he left the co-pilot to handle the plane, which resulted in the crash. However, Claire does not believe him and he leaves. She notices his briefcase has been left behind and is hysterical when she finds a ledger containing the names of the staff- the pilot is revealed to be Mr. Arkin- and passengers on the plane, including hers.  By daylight, she returns to the harbor and finds Eric on his boat. She tells him about the ledger and asks why he didn't tell her that both of them, the other passengers and Mr. Arkin never survived the crash. He tells her it's the kind of thing she had to figure out herself and reveals that departed people from their past came to help them to transition and accept their own death, such as his grandfather ([[William B. Davis]]) and childhood pet dog, and it is revealed that Shannon was helped by her mother and father, who are revealed to be the couple outside the building. Claire realizes her supervisor and neighbor are actually Mr. Perry her elementary teacher and her aunt Toni. She and Eric then sail away from the harbor, sharing a kiss as they cross over to heaven.  A flashback shows Claire and Eric sitting in adjacent seats on the plane, along with the other passengers, Mr. Arkin (who is revealed to be the pilot on the plane) and the man who blamed him. During the flight, Claire and Eric share a conversation and develop feelings for each other. When the plane depressurizes, Eric tells her to stay with him and they'll be alright. Claire smiles and caresses Eric's face as the screen fades to white.  The film ends with Emma and her husband being let into Claire's  apartment by the landlord, where she finds a note Claire was planning to send to make peace with her.  
Parugu

Meanwhile, Meenakshi tries to speak with them with an intention to find out details about Subbalakshmi and neither Krishna nor his friends can see her face because of the pent house's style of construction.  He asks her to help him find his love and in return promises her to tell details about Subbalakshmi's whereabouts. Added advantage to Krishna is a set of love letters received by Subbalakshmi from Errababu which are presently in his custody and Meenakshi is hell bent to recover them back. Meanwhile, Krishna's friend Srinu (Chitram Srinu) is caught red handed who, after execution of brutal force by Neelakanta's men, reveals that the couple is in Vishakhapatnam. At Vishakhapatnam, Krishna manages to send the couple Guntur without the knowledge of Neelakanta's henchmen and later at the pent house, he reveals that he is the mastermind behind the act of Subbalakshmi eloping with Errababu which is heard by Meenakshi who hid there and escapes through the back door.

When Krishna and his friends are brutally tortured, he lies that the couple are in Hyderabad to save his friends.

Upon his release in 1952 he joins a boxing gym in St. Louis, Missouri, run by Caesar Novak at the recommendation of Father Alois. His fellow inmate Catfish later arrives to act as his cut man. During this time Liston takes part in several matches and meets his future wife Geraldine. He visits Father Alois, now working in a church, to thank him and tell him about Geraldine. Sitting in a parked car with Geraldine at night he is told by a policeman to move his car along, which escalates into a fistfight and another prison sentence for Liston. Geraldine greets him at his release in 1957 and invites him to live with her at a house being rented to her by her cousin after getting married at a justice of the peace on the way. Liston experiences nightmares remembering abuse suffered at the hands of his father.  Caesar Novak takes Liston back in his gym as a fighter and asks him to stay out of prison. One night the policemen from the previous altercation stop by Liston's house and threaten him, telling him that he has to throw any future fight against [[Floyd Patterson]]. In 1962 Novak attacks Bobby Zazo in a club in a dispute over Farah, a girl Novak stole from him, and arranges through mutual organized crime connections to pay Zazo $10,000 in retribution. Mob connections pressure Novak to tell Liston to take a dive in the upcoming match against Patterson so that they can win on a bet but Novak asks Liston to win instead. Liston wins the match by knockout but no press arrives to interview the new champion. When approached by his organized crime connections, Novak explains that he actually bet their money on Liston and made them $1.2 million.  Liston is approached by the police and teased about his inability to write a message with his signature because of his lack of education. They attempt to pin a drunk driving charge on him, even though he is walking, and another fistfight ensues. That night in jail he is seriously beaten by the correction officers and told to get out of town or he will be killed. Novak takes him to Las Vegas, where Sonny and Geraldine buy a new house in December 1962 as the relationship between Caesar and Farah is falling apart.  In July 1963 Patterson and Liston fight a rematch, which Liston easily wins. Farrah pretends that Caesar has called for Sonny but when Sonny arrives Farrah merely requests sex and the two cheat on their respective partner. Novak waits outside Zazo's hotel room to threaten him to stop spreading rumors that Liston's fights are fixed and discovers him leaving the room with Farah. Farah and Sonny continue to meet for sex but find no romance in their relationship.  Liston is surprised by Cassius Clay's unusual style in their boxing match and asks Catfish to spread an irritating substance on his gloves to bother Clay's eyes. The irritant works but Liston nevertheless gives up the fight. Geraldine surprises Sonny and Farah with a gun at their next rendezvous and tells Farah to leave then tells Sonny that she hopes Cassius Clay beats him again. Already upset, Liston flies into a rage when provoked by the press with questions about the murder of Bobby Zazo and his connection to Caesar Novak. Liston asks Father Alois why others fail to give him the love they give to other fighters and the priest tells him that he cannot rely on the validation of others to determine his worth and that he has always been able to accomplish things through his own inner strengths.  Liston loses the rematch against Cassius Clay, now known as [[Muhammad Ali]], after falling down for 20 seconds following the famous [[Muhammad_Ali_versus_Sonny_Liston#The_phantom.2Fanchor_punch|phantom punch]]. Many cannot see the punch and the press once again attacks Liston, accusing him of taking a dive. Caesar's mob connections are likewise suspicious but after speaking with Sonny he convinces them that Sonny was not throwing the fight. Liston works his way back up in the rankings with a record of 14-1 in fights around the world between 1966 and 1969. The mob tells Caesar to tell Sonny to start taking dives and also inform him of the meetings between Sonny and Farah. Caesar confronts Farah and physically attacks her in jealous anger then throws her out. Out of spite he lies to the mob that Sonny refuses to take a dive, hoping that Sonny will end up getting hurt because of this. In 1971 Geraldine returns home from a trip to find Sonny dead. The police officially declare it a heroin overdose but there remains doubt about this explanation.

Manja analyzes the whole situation, sees Raksha, visits Rajiv's house, and tells the latter that someone is trying to take revenge on him, at which Vinay exclaims that it is none other than Madhu and Anshuman. Manja also tells them that Rajiv's driver has been helping the duo by providing them with necessary materials like Raksha's hair, soil from her foot and her toys to perform black magic.  Losing no more time, Rajiv, Vinay, Manja rush to Madhu's house, where she and Anshuman are found to be doing black magic rituals on a doll, supposedly an effigy of Raksha to trouble her. Rajiv orders Madhu to stop, but Madhu attacks him with a [[trishul (weapon)|trishul]]. Vinay takes on Anshuman. The effect of Black magic forces seep on the entire place, pushing everyone away. As Madhu is going to attack Rajiv who is being pushed towards the wall, Manja uses his powers to separate the running ceiling fan, which lands on Madhu's head, decapitating her. All the negative forces stop, a spider comes out of one of the skulls on the floor and bites the driver who dies.  Everyone rushes to the hospital to find that Raksha has completely recovered. Rajiv and Vinay see that everyone thinks it is the doctors who have cured Raksha, and they smile at each other.

Pig Hunt
  The film begins with a man running for his life through the forest, obviously in a panic he hides behind a tree, trying to spot what was following him. As he looks around, something comes up from behind him, throwing him up into the air and back down again. The man screams as something begins eating him, and as the man dies, the camera turns to a pair of dog tags that are slowly overtaken by a small river of blood.  John Hickman ([[Travis Aaron Wade]]) and his girlfriend Brooks ([[Tina Huang]]) are a pair of San Francisco residents who invite their friends, self-proclaimed tough guy and wannabe soldier Ben ([[Howard Johnson Jr.]]), his close friend Wayne ([[Rajiv Shah (actor)|Rajiv Shah]]), as well as chef Quincy ([[Trevor Bullock]]) and his dog Wolfgang, to a weekend of hunting, drinking and fun and camping near John's uncle's cabin, in a remote mountain area. Ben and Wayne can't stand Brooks, and the feeling is mutual-they spend much of the trip getting on each other's nerves. En route, they stop at a gas station/general store for directions and encounter a van of [[hippie]] women and their cult leader, the Hippie Stranger, ([[Bryonn Bain]]) who live in a commune in the woods, presumably raising emus for meat. From the store owner, they learn about a local legend called "The Ripper," a legendary killer hog which supposedly weighs several thousand pounds. After obtaining some supplies and directions, they make their way to the cabin, passing through a hillbilly homestead belonging to the Tibbs clan, all of whom drop what they are doing to watch them pass by. One young boy is perched in a tree, and drops a dead animal carcass on the hood of their car as they pass underneath. When they get to John's uncle's cabin, they find it has been vandalized and is uninhabitable, though John maintains the rednecks down the road weren't responsible. The group pitches their tents and camps outside.  The next morning, they encounter methamphetamine-addicted hillbilly brothers Jake ([[Jason Foster]]) and Ricky Tibbs, ([[Nick Tagas]]) cousins of John's, who are interested in joining them on a wild hog hunt. An old feud still exists between John and Ricky, who is a Gulf War veteran showing signs of drug addiction and mental illness. His brother Jake appears to be the only person maintaining control and keeping Ricky from flying off the handle. Quincy, who is eager to get to know them, is obviously inexperienced in any sort of outdoor activities, and Ricky accuses Wolfgang of being a 'pet' not a 'dog' seeming equally oblivious to hunting as well. When Jake Tibbs sets up some targets to see how well the others can shoot, boastful Ben makes a fool of himself, not being able to hit the target even once, while Wayne hits it not more than a couple of times. Brooks outshoots both men, to their surprise and chagrin-she impresses Tibbs by hitting the target with every shot.  As the group makes their trip through the woods, they encounter an area called the Big Wallow, and, using a piglet call as a lure, they manage to attract several pigs to their location. One of them rams into Wayne's leg at full charge giving him a compound fracture at the kneecap and incapacitating him. Wolfgang goes charging after the boars while Brooks shows off her marksmanship talents and kills one of them. Ricky calls Jake to come look at something disturbing he's observed while skinning and dressing the hog they killed. Though adult-sized, it has no protective armor over its shoulders-it is not a full grown animal as they had thought, but a piglet-a very, very big piglet. Just as everyone is beginning to wonder about the truth of the Ripper legend, Quincy reappears, very excited. While looking for his dog Wolfgang, he had encountered a large crop of marijuana plants and now leads the others to it, leaving Brooks with Wayne.  A conflict emerges when John objects to Jake and Ricky taking the plants for profit, as they are growing on his property and he wants no part of it. There is also a strange and disturbing sign posted near the plants, which leads John to think that the hippies that he thought were raising emus are actually growing pot instead. During the ensuing argument, Ricky snaps, and holds John at bay with a crossbow. John and Jake Tibbs are trying to gain control of the situation, when Ben arrives on the scene,thinks Ricky is about to kill John, and shoots him. Jake flees to tell his clan, and the others return to Wayne and Brooks. Quincy and Ben start making their way back to the cabin while Brooks and John leave Wayne to find something to make a stretcher with so they can carry him out of there and get back to the cabin and their vehicle. Shortly after their departure, Wayne is attacked by something we don't see, and manages to fire off a single round. Brooks and John circle back and find him missing, as well as Ricky's body.  Meanwhile, Ben and Quincy make their way back to the cabin. They find Wolfgang's mutilated body, and determine he was killed by the Tibbs clan. Ricky and Jake's clan make their appearance, Ben manages to kill his pursuer and escape, but Quincy is knocked out of the vehicle he was attempting to escape in, and is executed by a single gunshot to the back of the head. At the same time, John and Brooks run into the mysterious Hippie Stranger as they hide in the forest; he is carrying a cattle prod, and tells them that he is looking for an escaped animal, and that they can contact the police from his commune. He helps them beat off an attack by the murderous Tibbs clan, and several hillbillies are killed. In the meantime, Ben has found the commune, where he is given drugs by several beautiful hippie women, and led into an enormous, muddy pen. He encounters a dying Wayne, who says that something has been eating him. Ben turns in shock as something approaches him from behind, and screams.  The remaining Tibbs clan members have reached the woods around the commune;they are stalked and killed, one by one, by the murderous hippie women-all except one man, who is seized by something else-something horrifying that we don't see. Brooks and John arrive at the commune with the Hippie Stranger. When John questions why Ben's equipment is there, but not Ben himself, they force him into a cell while the leader takes Brooks out into the pen. At last, we are shown what has been attacking people throughout the movie-it is the legendary Ripper, who is carrying the remains of one of the redneck clan in his mouth. Meanwhile, Jake makes his way into the commune, and is confronted by some of the women. He shoots a couple of them, and forces one of the women to let him into John's cell. As Jake sees the Ripper out in the pen and freezes in shock, the hippie woman he brought with him attacks, stabbing him in the eye with her boar's tooth necklace before John kills her. Jake dies from his wounds while the Hippie Stranger prepares to sacrifice Brooks to the boar, whom he and his followers have for some bizarre reason been worshiping-and feeding unwary people to. Brooks gets a hold of the Stranger's cattle prod and pokes him with it, causing him to cry out, attracting the Ripper's attention. The creature eviscerates him, and Brooks remains as quiet as possible as John forces his way from the cell. Using a crossbow, he fires an arrow up under the boar's jaw, killing it. As Brooks and John make their escape, they come face to face with a young, wild member of the Tibbs clan-the feral little fellow who was sitting in a tree at the beginning of the movie. Fadeout to a black screen with a predicatable quote from [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]''.

In modern times, three misfits: the "yes man" George ([[Pa Grape]]), the lazy Sedgewick ([[List of VeggieTales characters#Mr. Lunt|Mr. Lunt]]), and the timid Elliot ([[Larry the Cucumber]]) are employees at a dinner theater. Although they want to be seen as heroes by their loved ones, as lowly cabin boys they think their dream is unattainable. After wrecking the show, they are fired and thrown into the alley, where the Helpseeker transports them to Monterria.  Meeting Eloise and Willory, the group sets off to Jolly Joe's Tavern where they learn that Robert has kidnapped the prince in the hopes of exacting revenge on the king. Setting sail in search of the whereabouts of Robert's hideout, Robert's men capture Eloise and Willory. The trio pursue the pirates, but not before running from living cheese curls (which results in Sedgewick overcoming his laziness) and a family of rock monsters.  Arriving at a hidden bay outside of Robert's fortress, the trio are attacked by a giant serpent. However, Elliot realizes the guardian is actually a mechanical device and is able to shut the machine down from inside and save his friends. Once inside Robert's fortress, George, Sedgewick, and Elliot rescue the prince and princess but are confronted by Robert. Finding his self-respect, George uses a chandelier to knock Robert down and the group escapes through the fortress's [[cistern]] with Robert in hot pursuit.

He refuses and confronts Blue, the Old Man, and Drea with the assignment. Matt is told that Steve is actually a [[dirty cop]] who deals with criminals; Matt refuses to believe this. Elsewhere, Steve kills an innocent [[chaplain]] because in a prior confession to the priest Matt had talked about his history with Steve. Steve uses this to frame Blue for the crime.

Unwilling to heed Steve's request, Matt is then arrested by Steve for being a "material witness" and released after two hours because Steve hopes to find the Old Man and kill Matt and Blue through following Matt. Still, Matt and Blue manage to escape. At the priest's funeral, which Matt later attends, Steve and his associates plan to kill Matt.  After the funeral ends, a standoff ensues between Matt and Steve. It is revealed that Steve stole the confiscated money and murdered Matt's partner out of fear that he would blow the whistle on Steve's operations. Blue and Drea show up to support Matt, much to the surprise of Steve, and a gunfight ensues. As a trump card, Steve reveals that he is holding Becky hostage, and threatens to kill her if Matt doesn't back down. Drea is able to free Becky while Matt and Blue fight Steve's associates. Blue is mortally wounded and says his goodbyes to Matt before passing. Matt and Steve confront each other once more and Matt successfully kills Steve.  Much later, Becky and her father are shown to be reunited and spending more time together than before.

The battle is witnessed by Newton Graceland, a specialist on the Reverse World, and by the film's antagonist Zero.  Shaymin survives, ending up in a beautiful seaside town ([[Bergen]]) where it runs into [[Ash Ketchum]], [[List of characters in the Pokémon anime series#Dawn|Dawn]], [[Brock (Pokémon)|Brock]] and their Pokémon, causing mayhem whilst trying to steal Ash's lunch. Shaken by its experience, Shaymin falls ill but healed at the local Pokémon Center.

[[Pokémon crime syndicates#The Team Rocket trio|Team Rocket]] appear and try to run off with Shaymin, only for a portal to the Reverse World to open and swallow them, Shaymin, Ash, [[Pikachu]], Dawn and [[Piplup]].  In the Reverse World, the kids encounter Giratina but are rescued by Newton, who explains the distorted world is an alternate dimension which reflects Earth, and he was trapped in the dimension five years ago whilst studying it. The balance between time, space and the Reversed World was damaged during Dialga and Palkia's fight in the previous film.

Giratina attacks the group after Shaymin provokes it before transforming back to its normal form, Newton and Team Rocket saving the kids. Zero appears, reveals he was Newton's assistant, and plans to use Shaymin's powers to open a portal for Giratina to return to Earth. Shaymin panics, opening a portal and sends everyone, save Team Rocket, back to Earth to Shaymin's home.  Freed from the time loop, Giratina is captured by Zero, who is using a device to absorb its abilities. The device was originally built by Newton, but he cancelled the project upon learning that the device would kill Giratina. Zero uses the device with the intention of becoming ruler of the Reverse World and destroying Earth. Ash, Dawn, Pikachu, Piplup, [[Chimchar]], [[Buizel]], [[Buneary]], and [[Ambipom]] attack Zero's ship whilst Newton is able to shut down the device, releasing Giratina. However, it collapses from exhaustion and nearly dies, but Shaymin revives it. Zero flees to the Reverse World to destroy Earth, damaging the mountain's glacier, awakening [[Regigigas]], who comes to save the glacier aided by a herd of [[Mamoswine]], along with Dawn's Buneary and [[Swinub]].  Ash, Pikachu, Shaymin, Chimchar, [[Turtwig]], and Giratina battle Zero, whose attack ship is empowered with Giratina's abilities. Chimchar and Turtwig are trapped by claws on Zero's ship, causing Ash to recall them. Shaymin uses the full extent of its power to open a portal, dragging everyone back to Earth, with Zero being frozen in the glacier, whilst Giratina returns Ash and Pikachu to Earth and restores the damage Zero has caused, before departing to track down Dialga. Shaymin is finally able to perform flower bearing, before migrating in Sky Forme with the rest of its kind. During the end credits, Newton rescues Zero who is then arrested, whilst Ash, Dawn and Brock send bouquets of flowers to their respective families.

 Fujimoto, a once-human [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]]/scientist, lives underwater along with his daughter, [[Brynhildr|Brunhilde]], and her numerous smaller sisters. While she and her siblings are on an outing with their father in his four-flippered submarine, Brunhilde sneaks off and floats away on the back of a [[jellyfish]]. After an encounter with a [[fishing trawler]], she drifts to the shore of a small fishing town in a glass jar where she is rescued by a five-year-old boy named Sōsuke. Shattering the jar open with a rock, Sōsuke cuts his finger in the process. Brunhilde licks his wound causing it to heal almost instantly. Sōsuke names her Ponyo and promises to protect her. Meanwhile, a distraught Fujimoto searches frantically for his lost daughter whom he believes to have been kidnapped. He calls his wave spirits to recover her, leaving Sōsuke heartbroken.  Ponyo and Fujimoto have an argument, during which Ponyo refuses to let her father call her by her birth name. She declares her desire to be known as 'Ponyo' and to become human. Using her magic, she forces herself to grow leg- and arm-like appendages and start changing into a human, a power granted to her by the human blood she ingested when she licked Sōsuke's finger. Her alarmed father forces her to change back into her true form and leaves to summon Ponyo's mother, Granmamare. Meanwhile, Ponyo, with the help of her sisters, breaks away from her father and inadvertently uses his magic to make herself fully human. The huge amount of magic that she releases into the ocean causes an imbalance in the world, resulting in a [[tsunami]], leaving ships stranded at sea. Ponyo goes back to Sōsuke, who is amazed and overjoyed to see her. He tells his mother that Ponyo has returned as a little girl. Sōsuke's mother allows Ponyo to stay at their house for the time being. Lisa (Sōsuke's mother), Sōsuke, and Ponyo wait out the storm at Sōsuke's house. Worried about the residents of the nursing home where she works, Lisa leaves to check up on them and promising Sōsuke that she will return home as soon as possible.  Granmamare arrives at Fujimoto's [[submarine]]. Sōsuke's father, Kōichi, sees her traveling and recognizes her as the [[Guanyin|Goddess of Mercy]]. Fujimoto notices the moon appears to be falling out of its orbit and [[satellite]]s are falling like shooting stars, symptoms of the dangerous imbalance of nature that now exists. Granmamare declares that if Sōsuke can pass a test, Ponyo can live as a human and that the order of the world will be restored. A still-worried Fujimoto reminds her that if Sōsuke fails the test, Ponyo will turn into sea foam.  Sōsuke and Ponyo wake up to find that most of the land around the house has been covered by the ocean. Since it is impossible for Lisa to come home, the two children decide to find her. With the help of Ponyo's [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]], they make Sōsuke's toy [[pop pop boat]] life-size and set out across the swollen ocean.  When Ponyo and Sōsuke make it to the forest, however, Ponyo tires and falls asleep only to be woken by Sōsuke, who implores her to ignite a second candle as the one powering their boat is about to go out. Ponyo then dozes off multiple times before concentrating enough to make the candle, which then goes out. She then passes out, and Sōsuke has to push the boat to shore, only to find that the boat, deprived of Ponyo's magic, is reverting to its toy size. Sōsuke drags Ponyo to the shore, where he finds Lisa's abandoned car. Ponyo then wakes up, and the two decide to continue looking for her.  Ponyo and Sōsuke head into a tunnel. Inside Ponyo reverts to being a fish due to overuse of her magical powers. Meanwhile, Lisa and the residents of the nursing home, who are temporarily able to breath water because of Granmamare, are waiting excitedly below the surface for Ponyo and Sōsuke to arrive. Sōsuke and Ponyo encounter Fujimoto, who warns the boy that the balance of nature is in danger and begs Sosuke to return Ponyo to him. Sōsuke doubts Fujimoto and attempts to flee, but the two children are quickly captured and Fujimoto takes them down to the protected nursing home.  Sōsuke is reunited with Lisa and meets Granmamare, with whom Lisa has just had a long private conversation. Granmamare asks Sōsuke if he can love Ponyo whether she is a fish or human. Sōsuke replies that he "loves all the Ponyos." Granmamare then tells her daughter that if she chooses to become human once and for all, she will have to give up her magical powers. Ponyo agrees to this, so Granmamare encases her in a bubble and gives her to Sōsuke. She tells him that kissing the bubble will complete Ponyo's transformation. The balance of nature is thus restored and the previously stranded ships head back to port. Fujimoto respects his daughter's choice to become a human, having decided he can trust Sōsuke with Ponyo's welfare. Ponyo then joyfully jumps high in the air and kisses Sōsuke, completing her transformation as a human.

Pontypool (film)
 In the small town of [[Pontypool, Ontario|Pontypool]], [[Ontario]], former [[shock jock]] turned [[radio announcer]] Grant Mazzy drives through a blizzard to work. On the way, Mazzy has a strange encounter with a nonsensical woman who gets his attention by putting her hand on his car window and only saying the word "blood" several times before staggering off into the storm. He arrives at the town's radio station, where he works with technical assistant Laurel-Ann Drummond, who has recently worked in Afghanistan, and station manager Sydney Briar, a divorcée.  As the morning proceeds, Grant's [[shock jock]] style and on-air persona irritates Sydney. They get a report from their helicopter reporter Ken Loney about a possible riot at the office of a Dr. Mendez. Ken describes a scene of chaos and carnage that results in numerous deaths. After Ken is unexpectedly cut off, the group tries to confirm his report, but their witnesses are disconnected before being put on the airwaves. A now audibly frightened Ken calls back and says he has taken refuge in a grain silo. He describes what he sees outside as people eating their way inside others and tearing themselves apart. An infected man crashes into the silo, crippling himself, and Ken's call is interrupted by a transmission in French.  Laurel-Ann translates the transmission, which is an instruction to remain indoors, not to use [[terms of endearment]], baby talk, rhetorical discourse, or the English language. Pontypool is declared to be under quarantine. Ken calls back again, and gets his phone close enough to the infected man for Grant and the women to hear his mumbling, which is nothing but "Mommy" in a child's voice. In confusion and disbelief, Grant tries to leave the station. A horde of people attack, and Grant, Sydney, and Laurel-Ann lock themselves in. Meanwhile, Laurel-Ann begins repeating the word "missing" and imitates the sound of a tea kettle. Dr. Mendez enters the studio and Grant, Sydney, and Mendez lock themselves in Grant's soundproof booth.  Mendez explains his theory: somehow a virus has found its way into the English language, infecting certain words, and only certain words infect certain people. Once these infected words are said and understood, the virus takes hold of the host, who finds another person to kill themselves with. As he explains, Laurel-Ann repeatedly slams against the sound booth's window, chewing off her lower lip and splattering blood with each attack. Ken calls in and, while on the air, he succumbs to the virus, repeating the word "sample". Sydney manages to call her children, only to hear them becoming infected. Outside the booth, Laurel-Ann vomits a large amount of blood and gore and falls down, dead. Mendez suspects this has happened since she failed to find a victim.  The horde then breaks into the radio station, attacking the sound booth. Sydney records a loop of Grant's voice and plays it over the outdoor loudspeaker to draw the mob outside. Dr. Mendez begins to repeat the word "breathe" but immediately switches to Armenian, which prevents the virus from taking over. Grant and Sydney, speaking in French, leave him in the booth. They are attacked by an infected young girl and kill her. When the recording fails, the mob returns. Mendez leaves the station and lures them away, saving Sydney and Grant, who now lock themselves in the equipment room.  While Grant tries to figure out how to reverse the symptom, Sydney begins drinking and obsessively writing on the wall and door. She then begins to succumb to the word "kill". Grant then attempts to "disinfect" Sydney by convincing her that the word "kill" now means "kiss". He urges her to repeat "Kill is kiss" over and over again, and her symptoms subside. She tells Grant to "kill" her, and he kisses her. Hoping to stop the virus, the pair go on the air, spouting a series of self-contradicting and confusing phrases to help their infected listeners, ignoring warnings from the authorities who are trying to get them off the air. While an amplified voice from outside counts down from ten, Sydney joins Grant in the booth and they kiss. As the countdown finishes, the screen goes dark and the credits roll.  Audio broadcasts play over the credits, reporting further outbreaks of the virus, suggesting that the quarantine failed. After the credits, the scene shifts to a radically different view: a stylized black-and-white version of Grant and Sydney in what looks like a far-eastern atmosphere. They give each other new names: Mazzy becomes "Johnny Dead-Eyes" and Sydney is "Lisa the Killer." As Grant describes his plan to "get out of here", the picture gradually shifts into color. According to director Bruce McDonald, the [[post-credits scene]] was originally the final scene of the film, taking place before the credits. However, audiences in early screenings found the original ending to be too confusing, so the scene was moved behind the credits instead.<ref></ref>

Because of this, Sarah is unable to care for the girls, forcing Agnes into a position of being a mother to her two younger sisters. The three girls live in the mother's whorehouse, the Poker House, where neighborhood pimps and criminals gather to play poker, as well. Agnes believes Duval loves her, as a boyfriend would, despite his abuse towards her mother.  The movie starts when Agnes arrives home, very early in the morning.

Poo (film)
 The film is set in a village named Kongankulam (Close to Alangulam), located between Rajapalayam and Sivakasi in southern Tamil Nadu. It entails two different dreams of two different people for one person.         The film begins showing Maari ([[Parvathy (actress)|Parvathy]]) happily married to her husband ([[Inigo Prabhakaran]]), a small shop owner. She leads an uncomplaining life with a smile on her face at all shades of events which fascinates even her husband. One day, she leaves alone to her village festival with the permission of her husband, who promises that he will follow her there after his business for the day has finished. When her mother asks why Maari came alone, she answers that she came early in order to see her cousin Thangarasu ([[Srikanth (actor)|Srikanth]]), much to her mother's dismay. On her way to see Thangarasu, she begins to reminisce of her past that includes her bold proclamation of her aim to be Thangarasu's wife from her school days - a time when they used to play together - that develops into her shy, unrequited yearning for him in her teenage years - a time when Thangarasu is an engineering student while Maari works as a labourer in her village's fireworks company along with her best friend Cheeni ([[Inbanila]]), a practical girl who at first advises Maari to be realistic, but later seeing her passion for Thangarasu helps her out in many ways as she could. By that time, everyone in her village knows about her ardent love for Thangarasu except for him. After many attempts, she fails at trying to confess her love to him or to even talk to him openly without feeling shy while he is away in city or in her village. However, Thanagarasu comes to realise her love after many incidents where people he knows tells him of this.   At the same time, the film shows Thangarasu's father (Ram) working as a cart driver and carrying labourer. He expects respect for his age from his young bosses and colleagues, but due to an unpleasant incident he presumably thinks that being rich and owning modern items such as a car only will bring him respect. He takes pride in the fact that his son is studying to be an engineer and dreams of big things about him. But, Thangarasu breaks his castle in the sky by saying that once he starts working, unless he joins a renowned company, his salary will be merely Rs.6000, not as large as Rs 35000 as software engineers earn as he is just a mechanical engineer. This shatters the dreams of Thangarasu's father who then resorts to alcohol and deems that he will never achieve the respect that he yearns.   Thangarasu's father is against the idea of Thangarasu marrying Maari as he believes that one cannot live happily and with respect just alone with higher education, but with money. Thangarasu, though initially after coming to know of Maari's faithful passion begins to reciprocate her feelings, but after finding out that the son of his best friend who had married his cousin had birth defections, he finds it not a good idea to marry someone in related by blood. Therefore, heartbreakingly agreeing to marry the proposed daughter of someone from a wealthy family that his dad approves of, thus choosing the dream of his father. Maari too agrees to marry someone else on a condition that her mother and brother must attend Thangarasu's wedding as they initially refused to go after discovering that Thangarasu will not wed Maari. Maari happily marries while wishing that Thangarasu and his wife to become successful and Thangarasu to be happy just as she will try to be with her husband.   Current day sees Maari entering Thangarasu's house and sees a car parked outside and also Thangarasu talking to someone on mobile about business related matters. Seeing her come, he directs her to go inside. She comes into the house and sees it decorated with latest modern devices. But nothing made her happier than seeing Thangarasu's wedding photo hung on the wall. She sees Thangarasu's wife in the backyard sitting on a chair reading a novel. She goes up to her and talks. Initially nice, his wife sneers later at the question of possible pregnancy making Maari shocked. She later witnesses in a hidden place, that Thangarasu's wife treats him badly and shames him for marrying her shamelessly, a rich woman, when he himself is poor. Though, begging his wife to stop shouting, in fear that Maari may hear and knowing that she still lives for him and hearing this will terribly traumatize her, he sees that she is hiding listening to all this with tears in her eyes. He then goes away with shattered heart to his room while Maari runs away and meets Thangarasu's father outside, who heeds to the situation seeing his arrogant daughter-in-law outside and his crying son inside, is also heartbroken. He explains to Maari saying that we both had a dream that we wanted, but I did not stop to hear the dream of that girl, by this indirectly quoting that had he, Thangarasu would not be in this unhappy marriage right now.   Maari flees from the scene and departs with her belonging back on the way she came just as her husband touches his feet into the village. He discovers his Maari too shocked to understand what had happened sitting on a tree stump emotionless. Upon hearing no answers from Maari for why she is here and not at her home, he shakes her and she starts wailing out loud, showing that her seemingly happy life led with her husband was all in hope that Thangarasu was also leading a happy life. But since he is not, it seems that she will lament for the rest of her life knowing the sadness and pain of her lover whom she cannot console.  
The Poughkeepsie Tapes
 When police raid a house in a city north of New York, they discover a profoundly disturbing record of one man's ugly crimes. Investigators find over 800 videotapes shot by the killer which present a visual record of his murders in all their horrifying details. Both state and federal law enforcement teams sift through the gruesome images, looking for clues of his identity, the identity of his victims, and where he could have gone. Repeated viewings of the materials reveal little beyond the terrible facts of the crimes, and as the authorities comb through the madman's images, they find the tapes have had a disquieting effect on them.  The killer not only captures the murders themselves, but the abductions, tortures and postmortem mutilations of his victims (along with bizarre [[Balloon fetish|fetishes involving balloons]]) all the while never allowing himself to be shown on film unless entirely disguised. Because the killer numbered the video tapes in order, investigators are able to determine that he started with the most vulnerable of victims: an 8-year-old named Jennifer Gorman is abducted while playing in her front yard.  After the success of his first abduction and murder, the killer becomes less impulsive in his crimes. Carefully selecting the area in which he will strike next, he convinces a couple, the Andersons, that his car has broken down and they agree to give him a ride to a local gas station for aid. On the way, he clubs the male in the head and subdues the female using a cloth doused in a chemical solution while filming her face in close up. Investigators understand this would have taken considerable practice to achieve. The tape shows that the killer performed a C-section on the female, placing the severed head of her husband inside her womb before sewing her up again to later rouse her from unconsciousness and film her reaction. In the process of investigating the Andersons' disappearance, they come to realise the level of mutilation the killer is capable of, as well as his degree of premeditation. The killer made himself known in the CCTV footage of another gas station some time before the Andersons' abduction and murder, using sign language to give clues where he intends to dispose of one of the bodies.  It is then shown that the killer is stalking his next victim, the teenage Cheryl Dempsey. Taking advantage that she is alone he enters her home, secretly walking through the house. After her boyfriend, Tim Surrey arrives, the murderer places the camera where it cannot be seen and hides in a closet until he is ready to attack. Although he abducts Cheryl, he murders and mutilates Tim, leaving his corpse at the scene. It is only after the discovery of the tapes it becomes clear that this crime scene has been carefully arranged in order to obscure possible psychological profiling. Rather than killing Cheryl, he imprisons her in his basement, abusing her sexually, physically and psychologically as his "slave", a name he beats her into accepting as her new one. Cheryl's mother, Victoria Dempsey, appeals to her kidnapper in a televised statement. He then goes to see her, offering to help in finding Cheryl while filming her response. It dawns on Victoria that she is confronted with the man that has abducted her daughter; he merely chuckles and runs away while she is paralyzed with shock.  At this point the killer changes his modus operandi and begins targeting prostitutes while posing as a police officer. Because of the location in which he dumps the bodies and the level of mutilation they have suffered, the press now dub him "The Water Street Butcher". Forensic investigations discover several of the bodies are found to have the same sperm secretions. Using Ted Bundy's advice on a previous series of murders, authorities come to realize that the killer might indulge in necrophilia with his victims and should stake out areas where they find "fresh bodies" instead of making the discovery public. Investigating one of the victims' apartments, police find fingerprints and saliva on an unwashed glass leading them to arrest former police officer James Foley. Because Foley has a history of visiting prostitutes, no alibi on the dates of the abductions, various evidence found within Foley's car, eye witness statements and matching sperm samples, he is convicted as The Water Street Butcher. Foley continues to plead his innocence and refuses to make any deals. A few days after James' execution by lethal injection, one of the leading investigators finds a map in his mailbox letting him know they have "missed one" and the location of a new body. It becomes clear that the real killer had taken James Foley's sperm from a fertility clinic and meticulously framed him (making James Foley another of his victims by proxy). Foley is exonerated of the murders on September 12. Because of the close date to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], this goes unrecognized by the general public.  Eventually, Cheryl Dempsey is discovered in the killer's empty house. She is rescued but is severely and irreversibly psychologically damaged from her ordeal. She has been mentally abused to such an extent that she harms herself in secret. In an interview, she [[Stockholm syndrome|identifies with her captor]] and defends him, saying that he loved her and will come back for her. It is revealed that shortly after the interview, she commits suicide.  In one last glimpse of the killer's sadistic nature, after the credits, a clip is shown of the face of one of his bound victims in close up. The killer taunts her by saying that he will make her a deal: he will release her unharmed if she does not blink. After a period of prolonged [[hyperventilation]], the film ends as her eyes close.

Samyukta ([[Kajal Aggarwal]]) is a student of a dance school and she falls in love with Ajay. At this juncture, Hussain ([[Subbaraju]]) takes charge as CI and he wants to nab Jakeer, Pandu, and Kasi but could not do so due to their political influence. Once, Pandu thrashes Kasi's son and his men attack the former. Ajay, who is there at the scene, gets involved in the fight and saves his father. Hussain arrests Pandu and Ajay.  Pandu comes to know that Jakeer is a mafia don and is not a gentleman as he is expecting. Jakeer gets Pandu killed by Kasi and his son. Ajay quits his ambition to become an IAS officer to avenge Pandu's death. Jakeer wants Ajay to kill Kasi and his son so Jakeer can control the city. Hussain makes everyone believe that all those who are killed by Ajay died in a mafia gang war, and helps Ajay attend the IAS main exams as he wishes. The film ends on a happy note with the reunion of Samyukta and Ajay.

While everybody is celebrating, Franny receives a call that four men from his precinct have been shot dead when answering a "shots fired" 911 call at the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] apartment of a local drug gang leader, Angel Tezo. Francis Sr. bullies Ray into joining a task force put together to investigate the killings.  Jimmy and fellow patrol officers Kenny Dugan, Reuben "Sandy" Santiago and Eddie Carbone find the abandoned cab Tezo fled in, containing the dead cab driver. The four officers are part of a corrupt group in Franny's precinct, along with the four dead officers. Under Jimmy's direction, they burn the cab and dead driver, and set about finding Tezo before Ray and the task force do.  Ray tells Franny that his investigation has revealed that a policeman named Sandy had tipped off Tezo to the raid. When Franny later confronts Santiago, he admits to what he did and expresses surprise that Franny never knew what was going on with the officers in his precinct. He says "Everyone knew." The cops had intended to kill Tezo so they could work with another dealer, Eladio Casado, but Santiago warned Tezo due to a childhood friendship, believing Tezo would simply flee. Though Franny tells Santiago to hand over his badge, he does not take the information to his superiors for fear of losing his command. Later, Casado arrives at Jimmy's house, pressuring Jimmy for failing to find and kill Tezo.  Steady police work helps Ray find Tezo, while elsewhere Jimmy beats Tezo's cousin and prepares to kill the cousin's baby to get the same information. Ray reaches Tezo only to find Jimmy and his crew there first, torturing Tezo to death. Ray tries to intervene; however, Jimmy suddenly uses Ray's gun to kill Tezo, then tells Ray to accept being the hero who killed the cop-killer.  Jimmy's crew leaves just before Ray's backup arrives.  Overcome with grief over his role in the murders and the corruption, Santiago meets privately with a reporter and confesses to the corruption (but gives no names) in the 31st Precinct. Santiago then commits suicide in the reporter's car.  After the newspaper reports the corruption, [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] (IAB) investigates the Tezo killing. Ray says he was not the shooter and refuses to say more, while Jimmy admits his crew was there then fabricates a story that Ray killed Tezo in cold blood. Francis Sr. is furious with his son for not lying to IAB, to which Ray reveals that he did enough lying for his father regarding the shooting that hurt him two years earlier, at which his fellow officers threw the shooter off a building for revenge.  Franny arrives and tells his father that the lies and corruption end now, and they will arrest their brother-in-law even if it costs Franny his career.   Things quickly unravel within the 31st Precinct sector. Franny and Ray look for Jimmy, while Dugan and Carbone hold up a liquor store, with Carbone and a customer soon dead and Dugan holding the owner hostage.  While Tezo's cousin agitates the crowd outside the liquor store, Franny goes in and arrests Dugan. Ray confronts Jimmy at a nearby bar, where Ray wins a brutal brawl between them. Ray is walking a handcuffed Jimmy back to the liquor store when the still-agitated crowd surrounds them.  Tezo's cousin has the crowd hold Ray while Jimmy offers himself to be beaten to death. Ray staggers away from his dead brother-in-law, making it back to Franny at the liquor store. A few days later, the three Tierney men arrive at the [[New York County Courthouse]] to give their statements.

Presto (film)
 [[Vaudeville]] era magician Presto DiGiotagione is famous for a [[hat-trick (magic trick)|hat trick]] wherein he pulls his [[rabbit]] Alec Azam out of his [[top hat]]. A hungry and irritated Alec is locked in a cage, unable to reach his [[carrot]].<ref name="smith"/> After Presto returns from eating a meal, he begins practicing his act with Alec, revealing that his top hat is magically connected to a wizard's hat kept backstage with Alec. Anything that passes into either hat will emerge from the other.  Intending to feed Alec, Presto realizes that his show is starting and rushes onstage instead. Alec refuses to cooperate with the act and turns the hats against Presto in a variety of ways that lead to escalating degrees of humiliation, such as letting him catch his finger in a mousetrap, hit himself in the eye with a raw egg, and get his head sucked into a ventilation shaft. Presto continues to antagonize Alec at the same time, first turning the carrot into a flower and later smashing it to pulp with a hammer.   Fed up with Alec's behavior, Presto storms backstage after him, but accidentally releases a set of hanging stage props and gets his foot caught in a rigging rope. He is yanked up into the [[fly system|fly space]] above the stage; when his foot comes loose, he falls again and finds himself in danger of being crushed by both the props and a falling piano. Alec uses the hats' magic to save him, earning the audience's wild approval for him and Presto, who gratefully gives him a fresh carrot and starts to give him second billing on the posters advertising the act.

Presumed Guilty (film)
 Two lawyers struggle to free a man, Antonio Zúñiga, who has been wrongly convicted by the Mexican judicial system. Zúñiga was arrested on charges of murder and convicted largely on the testimony of one man. Zúñiga was told by authorities “You did it and that’s it”. Zúñiga was given the sentence of 20 years in prison for a crime that was impossible for him to have committed. Three witnesses explained that he was at his place of work during the time of which he was accused of murder. However, the man was a close relative of the victim who had no firm evidence against Zúñiga, while the accused produced several witnesses able to place him far from the scene of the crime at the time of the murder. Despite this, Zúñiga was found guilty, and when lawyers Roberto Hernández and Layda Negrete learned about his case, they agreed to help him. Hernández and Negrete cautiously advised Zúñiga, knowing that many case like his had failed before him and they were fearful of providing Zúñiga and his family with too much hope. Before leaving for graduate school in Berkeley, CA, Hernández and Negrete advised the family to go public with this case- they felt it was their best shot at pressuring the Mexican judicial system to admit their error and free Zúñiga. After it was revealed that the lawyer appointed to represent Zúñiga did not have a valid license to practice law, authorities grudgingly agreed to a new trial, but with the same judge, Héctor Palomares Medina, presiding. This judge showed little interest in evidence that Zúñiga was falsely convicted. Battling an arrogant judge, uncooperative witnesses and a legal system riddled with corruption, Hernández and Negrete found that it was easy to prove Zúñiga's innocence, but hard to get the authorities to acknowledge this fact. “The conviction was eventually overturned in 2008 after the filmmakers persuaded the judges hearing the appeal to watch the videos. Zúñiga was immediately released"<ref>Tuckman, Jo. "Mexican film ban attempt elevates Presumed Guilty to box-office hit."

Unfortunately, situations like these are more common than one would hope after viewing “Presumed Guilty.” One woman, Rosa Juilia Leyva Martinez, told the [[Washington Office on Latin America]] that she was traveling within Mexico to buy seeds with some people in her town. Unbeknownst to her, she carried one of their bags through the airport that contained heroin. Once arrested, she reported that she was tortured, raped, and forced to sign a confession which sentences her to 22 years in prison. She was released after 11 years. “According to the Mexican Ministry of the Interior's 2012 National Survey of the Criminal Justice System, only 6% of the Mexicans surveyed had confidence in the justice system. Responders said the main problems were that criminals are not held accountable, the system is corrupt, the judicial process slow, and the service from public servants is poor.”<ref>Meyer, Maureen.

Pretty Ugly People
  The film begins with a voice-over by Lucy ([[Missi Pyle]]) discussing what it's like being fat, and having skinny friends in college. She calls her friend Becky ([[Melissa McCarthy]]), crying and insinuating she is dying. She asks Becky to rally all of the women's college friends for one final trip to see Lucy, who now helps run Holland Lake Lodge in [[Condon, Montana]].  Orchestrated by Becky, the circle of friends meet up in an airport in Montana. Becky brings her husband Richard and introduces him, for the first time, to commodities trader George, [[Grammy]] nominated rap producer Trevor, flight attendant Austin, and State Representative Raye who also brings his wife, Mary ([[Octavia Spencer]]).  When the group is assembled a man named Sam approaches the group and tells them Lucy has sent him to drive them to the lodge where she is staying.  After arriving at the lodge, the group is greeted by an attractive blonde woman.  When no one recognizes her, Lucy reveals to her friends that it is her, no longer fat! Later at lunch, Lucy explains to her friends that she has had [[gastric bypass surgery]] and she remains four pounds away from her ideal weight.  Waking the group early the next morning, she informs them that they are going on a four-day hike in which she will drop her final four pounds of weight.  The majority of the film centers on the hiking trip. Over the course of the trip, various aspects of the lives of all of Lucy's friends are revealed.  George reveals himself as [[gay]].  Raye and Mary are unhappy together and Mary ends up taking off her wedding ring and ending her marriage to Raye.  Similarly, Becky and Richard are unhappy in their marriage, and it is revealed that Becky is having an affair with a co-worker.  At the end of the hike, Lucy prepares dinner for them before Sam comes to pick everyone up in the bus. Everyone is angry with Lucy, especially Becky, who convinced everyone else to come after Lucy called her. Lucy tells them she believed that becoming thin would make her as happy as them, but what she has realized on the trip is that none of them are happy, and that it never had anything to do with weight.  As Sam is driving the group back to the lodge, he has a heart attack and the bus goes off the road. Sam is dead and Richard dies while waiting for help. Richard apologizes to Becky for the way he treated her just before he dies. Everyone else survives, after Raye runs to get help, also proving to Mary that he cares about others more than himself. Raye goes back to Washington and wins a Senate election. In the final scenes of the movie, everyone (except for Raye) is having lunch on a beach, an inestimable time after the bus accident.  Lucy and Becky, who is pregnant, wade into the water so that Becky can toss Richard's ashes to sea. Afterwards, they hug.

Prom Night (2008 film)
 In 2005, [[Bridgeport, Polk County, Oregon|Bridgeport]] native Donna Keppel, a high school freshman, returns home from a  date with her friend Lisa Hines to find her father and little brother murdered. Donna hides under the bed, where she sees her mother struggle with her former teacher Richard Fenton, who has become obsessed with Donna. As Donna locks eyes with her mother, she witnesses Fenton murder her after she refuses to tell him where Donna is. Three years later, Donna - now a high school senior, lives with her Aunt Karen and Uncle Jack and is about to graduate. She regularly visits her psychiatrist, Dr. Elisha Crowe, and takes [[anti-depressants]] to cope with her depression.  Donna and her friends are getting ready to attend their senior prom. While at the hairdressers with Lisa and Claire, Donna sees Fenton standing outside but realizes she was hallucinating. Donna's boyfriend, Bobby, arrives at her house along with her friends and their boyfriends, Ronnie and Michael. At the police station, Detective Winn, who imprisoned Fenton three years ago, learns that he has escaped and warns Karen and Jack. The authorities fail to notify the detective about the escape - which occurred 3 days earlier. Fenton also has the almost superhuman ability to evade and move around undetected. Karen thinks Donna should come home, but Jack convinces her that Donna should stay at the prom and have a good time in order to not ruin the psychological progress she has made.  At the prom, Fenton arrives at the hotel disguised as a man named Howard Ramsey. He reserves a room on Donna's floor and stabs the housekeeper to death to get the master key. Claire has an argument with her boyfriend Michael, and goes up to her room with Donna to calm down. After Donna leaves, Claire hears noises and sees Fenton - who stabs her to death. When Claire does not return, Michael goes upstairs to see her. Fenton attempts to hide in the closet, but Michael sees the door close. Michael, thinking Claire is in it, opens the closet and Fenton murders him.  Winn arrives and it becomes clear that Fenton is on a deadly killing spree in the hotel and warns the staff, one of whom Fenton kills. Lisa and Ronnie bump into Fenton in the elevator on their way to their room; Lisa for a split second recognizes Fenton but is unsure if its him. While making out with Ronnie, Lisa realizes she saw Fenton and without stopping to think about the situation - and abruptly runs off to warn Donna, which makes Ronnie sad as he was about to propose to her. After waiting for the elevator, which does not come soon enough, Lisa takes the stairs, but Fenton chases her down to a lower floor under construction. Lisa hears the elevator doors open and sees Ronnie call for her. She attempts to flee, but Fenton slices her throat.  Winn and Detective Nash find the body of the real Howard Ramsey in his car trunk. Winn goes up to the room booked under Ramsey's name and finds the housekeeper's body. He sounds the emergency alarm and has the hotel evacuated. Donna goes back to her room to retrieve her mother's shawl, but runs into Fenton, who tries to break into her room. Realizing Donna is still inside, Winn races back up to the room, but Donna escapes from Fenton. SWAT and police search the hotel, but find no sign of Fenton. Winn discovers the body of the employee stuck in the ventilation shaft and realizes that Fenton has left the hotel in the employee's uniform. Detective Nash escort Bobby and Donna to her house and summons security officers to guard her house. In the meantime, Winn loses radio contact with Nash and races back to Donna's house, only to discover his body in his squad car.  Inside, Donna experiences more hallucinations, and goes to the bathroom. Upon returning to her bedroom she discovers that Bobby is dead with his throat slit. She sees a shadow out in the hall and hides in her closet, thinking it is Fenton.  She learns that the shadow is only Winn, and Fenton grabs Donna in the closet. Winn is about to open the closet, but hears a scream from Karen, who has seen a dead officer on the ground outside, so Winn runs to her bedroom. Donna attacks Fenton - who retaliates and a violent struggle ensues. When Fenton is about to stab Donna to death, Winn returns and shoots Fenton seven times, killing him. Donna goes back to Bobby's dead body and cries over him. Winn hugs and consoles her while authorities arrive at the scene. Donna's aunt and uncle run in the room, and they are escorted out of the area while the SWAT and rescue teams secure the house and recover the bodies.  
The Prodigal Trilogy
 The film is divided into three acts, each act containing the three characters' monologues. Each character is played by [[Jason Hildebrand]].<ref name=vf></ref>  === Act I === Act I is the younger son's story. He tells of how he demanded that his father should give him his inheritance right away, and how he then ran away and spent himself on every pleasure he could think of. When his money was spent and his pleasure all gone, he tells of how he went back home to his father, and how his father accepted him back into the family.  === Act II === The second act contains the story of the older brother, who tells of his own righteousness and his disgust at what his younger brother did. When his brother returned home, he watched in horror at how his father welcomed back his son, going so far as to even throw a party for him, even though he had never given his elder (and more upright in standing) son a party.  === Act III === Act III gives us the father's perspective on the whole situation. He speaks of how, deeply saddened by his younger son's actions, he did the only thing a parent could do in a situation like this – he prayed, and continued loving. When his son finally came home, he joyfully accepted him back into the family with his complete heart. The only thing that saddens him still is that his older son, though doing all the right things outwardly, is more lost than the younger son ever was, because of his heart-attitude.  
Prodigal Sons (film)
 Paul becomes a high achiever: a high school football hero, socially popular, named "best looking," and the class valedictorian.  Paul however, since kindergarten, has felt that something was askew with the male gender that was assigned at birth. Paul begins to discover that she is transgender and changes her name to Kimberly Reed. She eventually transitions into a confident and successful woman in society, and also happens to be lesbian.  Kim's younger brother, Todd, eventually comes out as gay as well.  Reed eventually becomes a film maker and decides to make a documentary about her return home to Montana for her high school reunion.  She documents her interaction with family, old friends and classmates as she tries to educate others on what it means to be transgender.  She also documents her attempts at reconciling her relationship with her adopted brother Marc, who struggles to see her as female. She discovers many revelations on her journey including, among several other things, that Marc's shocking blood relationship as the secret grandson of [[Orson Welles]] and [[Rita Hayworth]].  In the movie, the intense sibling rivalry and unforeseeable twists of plot force Kim's family to face serious challenges.  Marc's mental health seriously declines throughout the documentary until he is voluntarily admitted to a mental health facility.  At the same time, Kim learns to accept her entire past, including her childhood and early adulthood, in which she lived her life as male.  The documentary explores how growing up trans affects a person's development within their family and in society.  It also shows how mental illness can challenge familial relationships and serve as a stumbling block to understanding modern changes in family dynamics.  Kimberly Reed and her mother Carol appeared on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]] "Transgender Transition" on February 11, 2010, to discuss Kim's life and the documentary.  ===Aftermath=== Marc McKerrow's biological mother, Rebecca Welles (Manning), secretly gave birth to a son on March 31, 1966, when she was 21. Orson Welles never knew about his grandson. Rita Hayworth arranged the adoption of her grandson and did not allow Rebecca to see or hold her son. When Marc was 21, he was in a car accident that resulted in a traumatic brain injury. This injury resulted in severe mental challenges to his health and required intense medical treatment to control violent outbursts.  Rebecca Welles died on her mother's, Rita Hayworth's, birthday October 17, 2004 at the age of 59.  Marc McKerrow requested, through the courts, that his adoption file be opened. Through the adoption agency Marc discovered his true lineage and contacted his biological mother, Rebecca Welles, shortly before her death. According to Chris Welles Feder, Rebecca's eldest sister, a meeting between Marc and Rebecca never took place due to the aggressive advanced-stage cancer that quickly overtook her. Marc attended her funeral.  Marc McKerrow died suddenly in his sleep on June 18, 2010, only four months after Kim Reed's appearance on "Oprah." His death was "...caused by complications from a nocturnal seizure" related to his car accident.<ref>http://helenair.com/news/local/obituaries/article_b2081642-7e92-11df-81a9-001cc4c03286.html</ref>

Punisher: War Zone
  Frank Castle, who has been the [[Punisher]] for five years, assaults a party for [[American Mafia|mob]] boss Gaitano Cesare, and kills him and the guests. [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Billy "The Beaut" Russotti]] escapes to his recycling plant hideout, and Detectives [[Martin Soap]] and Saffiotti, who were staking out the party, inform Castle. Castle infiltrates Russoti's hideout, and after a brief firefight, Russoti is thrown into a glass-crushing machine that leaves him hideously disfigured. Russoti later refers to himself as "[[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]]" because the stitches in his face resemble puzzle pieces. Castle, who takes cover behind the body of Nicky Donatelli, discovers that Donatelli was actually an undercover agent.  Agent [[Paul Budiansky]], the deceased agent's partner, joins the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]'s "Punisher Task Force", partnering with Soap to help bring Castle to justice. Meanwhile, Jigsaw frees his deranged and [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] brother, "[[Psychiatric hospital|Loony Bin]] Jim".  Distraught over killing the agent, Castle attempts to make reparations to Donatelli's wife, Angela, and daughter, Grace, only to no avail. Castle threatens to retire from the vigilante business, but his armorer, [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]], makes him reconsider, telling him that Jigsaw will go after Donatelli's family for revenge.  Jigsaw, Loony Bin Jim, and two goons, Ink, and Pittsy, break into Donatelli's house, and hold the family hostage. The Punisher tracks down Maginty, a known associate of Jigsaw, executing him after extracting the information before being apprehended by Budiansky and Soap. Castle tells him that Jigsaw went after Donatelli's family, and Budiansky sends a police car to check on the Donatelli residence, intending to turn the Punisher in. When the patrol car fails to respond, Budiansky checks on the house, where he is captured by Ink and Pittsy. Soap frees the Punisher, who kills Ink and Pittsy before leading Donatelli's wife and daughter away. Budiansky then arrests Jigsaw and Loony Bin Jim after a short gunfight.  Jigsaw and his brother bargain with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] for their release by giving up Cristu Bulat, who was smuggling in a biological weapon destined for Arab terrorists in [[Queens]], [[New York City|New York]]. The brothers are granted immunity, plus the [[US$]]12 million Bulat was paying to use Jigsaw's port, and a file on Micro. They take Micro hostage, killing his mother in the process. They once again take the Donatellis hostage, after critically injuring Micro's associate Carlos, whom Castle had left to protect them. Castle later arrives at the hideout, and [[Coup de grâce|euthanizes]] Carlos. Jigsaw sets himself up in the Bradstreet Hotel, putting together a small army of gangsters, who want vengeance against the Punisher. Castle enlists the help of Budiansky, who informs Cristu's father, Tiberiu Bulat, where Jigsaw is located. Tiberiu's goons start a shootout in the hotel lobby, affording Castle a distraction.  Castle enters through a second-floor window, leading to a firefight with Jigsaw's hired guns. Afterward, Castle engages Loony Bin Jim in solo combat; realizing that he will probably not survive the brawl, Jim flees. Castle chases him and confronts both him and Jigsaw, who are holding Micro and Grace Donatelli at gunpoint. Jigsaw gives Castle a choice: If Frank shoots Micro, Jigsaw will let the others go free. Micro bravely offers his life to save the girl, but Castle chooses to shoot Loony Bin Jim instead. As a result, Jigsaw kills Micro. Enraged by the loss of his partner, Castle attacks Jigsaw, eventually impaling him with a metal rod and throwing him onto a fire. As Jigsaw burns to death, Castle calmly tells him, "This is just the beginning." Outside, Angela forgives Castle, who bids farewell to Budiansky and the Donatelli family. As Castle and Soap leave together, Soap tries to convince Castle to give up his vigilante status after having "killed every criminal in town." Soap changes his mind when he is held up by a murderous mugger, who quickly becomes another victim of the Punisher.  
The Promotion
 Doug Stauber is the assistant manager of a branch of Donaldson's, a supermarket chain in [[Chicago]]. He believes that he is a "shoo-in" for manager of a Donaldson's that is scheduled for construction just a few blocks away from his home. Everyday, Doug deals with the pressures of being the assistant manager. Among his ordeals are an unruly gang of teenagers loitering around the parking lot, the overwhelming amount of negative comments on the customer survey cards he collects (nearly all of which are caused by the gang's antics), a foreigner who constantly slaps him over a box of [[Teddy Grahams]], and the rumors about him being a former Junior Olympics medalist in gymnastics. Then one day, Richard Wehlner and his family move in from [[Quebec]], and he becomes assistant manager alongside Doug.  Since Richard's arrival, it appears that he has replaced Doug as front-runner for the job. But it soon becomes clear that Richard has disadvantages of his own, such as a past substance abuse problem and a tendency to make inappropriate remarks. In one incident, both men are challenged by the board of directors over a sign posted on the deli section window, citing the deli clerk as Employee of the Month for "[[Flatulence|cutting the cheese]]". Richard admits being manager on duty when the sign was discovered, and explains that he had not realized that the phrase is derogatory to the American public (claiming that "cracking the cheese" is what Canadians say). The competition between Doug and Richard causes strain on their respective marriages. Doug is under financial pressure to get the job because he has begun to buy a house that he cannot afford if he is not promoted while his wife Jen ponders on going to night school. Meanwhile, Richard's wife Laurie and daughter leave him to temporarily move to her parents' home in [[Scotland]] when she sees he is losing control and reverting to his previous behavioral problems.  One day, while helping a customer in the parking lot, Doug is hit on the back of the head by a bottle of [[Yoo-hoo]] thrown by one of the gang members. In retaliation, he confronts the gang and sprays one of them with [[Mace (spray)|mace]]. Further worsening the situation is an incident in the break room, where a furious Doug throws some frozen [[Tater Tots]] toward the trash can and accidentally hits Richard's hand with one; Richard fakes an injury by wearing a [[wrist brace]] at work. Days later, Doug gives an apology speech at a local community explaining his actions during the incident and wins the respect of the community, assuring them that a beautiful day should not be spoiled by a few "bad apples". After the meeting, the board of directors, the assistant managers and the community leaders have a brief meeting, wherein Richard inadvertently refers to the gang as "black apples", infuriating the head community leader.  After several attempts to eliminate each other as competitors, both Doug and Richard, along with another prospect, are summoned by the board of directors for a final interview. Richard's hopes are shattered when it is revealed that a drug test is required, as he has recently smoked [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Shortly after the interview, Doug is given a call by Mitch and notified that he has landed the job, as Richard failed his drug test and the other candidate is too junior-grade for the position. He celebrates by doing cartwheels and backflips while crossing the street – finally confirming the earlier rumor about himself. Meanwhile, after reuniting with his wife, Richard and his family return to Quebec to his old grocery store, where he is reported to have become the store manager after singlehandedly stopping an accidental fire (which is rumored to have been started by Richard himself).

He and Justine get out, and he tells her to run straight to the bus. As they are about to reach it, Michelle appears. Stephen convinces his daughter that she should get on the bus and sacrifices himself to Michelle, saying that if she did not want to be lonely, she should take him and not their daughter. As she is about to touch his face, she backs off and disappears with a smile. Stephen is relieved and thanks her, but Marta's ghost clings to him and takes his soul. Marta then backs off and Michelle is shown standing there smiling.  Justine is safely in the bus with other refugees and escapees unscathed.

After evading pursuers, Bond delivers White to [[M (James Bond)|M]], who interrogates him regarding his organisation, [[SPECTRE#Rebooted continuity|Quantum]]. M's [[bodyguard]], Craig Mitchell (Glenn Foster), is a [[double agent]]; he attacks M, enabling White to escape. Bond chases Mitchell and kills him. Bond and M return to London and search Mitchell's flat, discovering Mitchell had a contact in [[Haiti]], Edmund Slate ([[Neil Jackson]]). Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent to kill [[Camille Montes]] ([[Olga Kurylenko]]) at the behest of her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur [[List of James Bond villains#Quantum of Solace|Dominic Greene]] ([[Mathieu Amalric]]). Observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano ([[Joaquín Cosío]]), who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow his government and become the new president, in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.  After rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a performance of ''[[Tosca]]'' in [[Bregenz]], Austria. Meanwhile, the head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s South American section, Gregg Beam ([[David Harbour]]), strikes a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A [[Counter Terrorism Command|Special Branch]] bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines ([[Paul Ritter (actor)|Paul Ritter]]), is killed by one of Greene's men after Bond throws him off a roof. M assumes Bond killed him, and has Bond's passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads to Italy and convinces his old ally [[List of James Bond allies#René Mathis|René Mathis]] ([[Giancarlo Giannini]]) to accompany him to Bolivia. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields ([[Gemma Arterton]]), a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police working for Medrano. They had earlier attacked Mathis and put him in the boot of Bond's car to frame Bond. In the ensuing struggle, Mathis and the cops are killed.  The following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is shot down by a Bolivian fighter aircraft. They [[skydive]] into a [[sinkhole]], and discover Quantum is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a [[monopoly]]. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in [[Petroleum|crude oil]]. Bond meets CIA Agent [[Felix Leiter]] ([[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]), who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet in the [[Atacama Desert]] to finalise their agreement. Warned by Leiter, he evades the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] when they attempt to kill him.  At an [[eco hotel]] in the desert, Greene tells Medrano that now he controls the majority of Bolivia's water supply, Medrano must accept a new contract that makes Greene Planet Bolivia's sole water [[utility company]] at significantly higher rates. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills the chief of police ([[Fernando Guillén Cuervo]]) for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum, leaving him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil, wondering if Greene will get thirsty enough to drink it.  Bond travels to [[Kazan]], Russia, where he finds [[Vesper Lynd]]'s former lover, Yusef Kabira ([[Simon Kassianides]]), a member of Quantum who seduces women with valuable connections, and who is indirectly responsible for her death. Bond tells Kabira's latest target, Corrine Veneau ([[Stana Katic]]), a [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service|Canadian Intelligence]] agent, of Kabira's true intentions, thus sparing her Vesper's fate. He allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in the middle of the desert, shot twice and with engine oil in his stomach. M tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that he never left. Walking away, he drops Vesper's necklace in the snow.

They are given a department tour, but an emergency call dispatches them. Arriving, screams from a self-barricaded apartment block room were heard by the landlord and residents. The firemen, police officers, and crew enter; they are attacked by an aggressive elderly woman. Fletcher also mysteriously falls to the base floor, incapacitated. The old woman bites a policeman and is killed. As the residents are ordered downstairs for their own safety, the team finds a second woman in a similar condition and bring her downstairs with others.  Those wounded by the women become sick and delirious. Angela interviews a sick little girl who states that her dog is at the vet because he was sick too. The authorities and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] suddenly quarantine the building, allowing none to leave.  A resident [[veterinarian]] recognizes the symptoms as similar to those of [[rabies]]. CDC officers wearing [[hazmat suit]]s enter the building and begin working on the two victims on the ground floor, but chaos ensues as the victims attack. It is revealed that, the day before, the little girl's dog is the reason the CDC has quarantined the building.  The little girl bites her mother and later attacks a pursuing police officer.  All the other infected break loose and start attacking. The team retreats upstairs and lock themselves in a room, but discover two people who have been bitten. A panicked resident who rips through the window covering is shot by a [[sniper]]. The landlord reveals that the basement, which connects to the sewers, may be the only way out. The two infected then attack, forcing Jake, Angela, and Scott to flee the room.  Jake is eventually bitten as the trio find the basement key. Angela and Scott now appear to be the only human survivors. Rather than making their way to the basement, the pair are forced upstairs to the attic apartment by the remaining infected, where they find lab equipment and newspaper clippings about a doomsday cult and a break-in at a chemical weapons lab where a virus was stolen. A [[trapdoor]] opens from the attic and Scott loses the camera light as he investigates it, the light broken by a small boy swatting at it. Scott turns on the night vision, and he and Angela hear loud banging noises inside the apartment. The source of the noises is an emaciated man, apparently unaware of them, blindly searching. Scott attempts escape but trips and drops the camera. Angela retrieves it and looks around the room, only to see the man eating Scott. In fright, she cries out and is attacked. She drops the camera and is unable to locate it; as she is crawling in pain, she is then dragged screaming into the darkness.

Race (2008 film)
 A voice-over by RD ([[Anil Kapoor]]) introduces the four main characters: Ranvir Singh "Ronny" ([[Saif Ali Khan]]) who runs a successful business he inherited from his father. His younger brother Rajiv Singh ([[Akshaye Khanna]]) who mooches off of Ronny and is an alcoholic. Ronny is dating an upcoming model Sonia ([[Bipasha Basu]]), while his personal assistant Sophia ([[Katrina Kaif]]) appears to be secretly in love with him. Ronny is also involved in an intense competition with a rival horse-owner Kabir ([[Dalip Tahil]]). The film opens with a murder plot involving a car accident which Ronny narrowly survives. When Ronny loses money in a race because his jockey had been bribed by Kabir, Ronny plants a bomb in the jockey's car and kills him, showing Ronny to be a ruthless businessman. Later, Ronny also destroys Kabir when the latter offers him money to buy his business, which is in debt.  In a drunken stupor, Rajiv confesses to Ronny that he likes Sonia and that he would quit drinking if he could spend his life with a woman like her. Ronny immediately stops dating Sonia so that Rajiv can have her. Rajiv and Sonia begin dating and appear happy until, in a twist, Rajiv reveals he knows of Sonia's shady past and has a plan to use Sonia to his advantage. Rajiv reveals that his father had secured identical life-insurance policies for huge sums on each of the sons. He explains that he wants to kill Ronny in what would appear to be an accident and inherit $100 million in insurance payments and wants Sonia to play along. Sonia agrees to help in exchange for $20 million. They pretend to get married and Rajiv ignores Sonia in this fake-marriage while continuing to play an alcoholic. As per his instructions, Sonia seduces Ronny who confesses he loved her all along. Rajiv reveals the rest of his plan: to threaten to commit suicide in response to Sonia and Ronny's affair by leaping off a tall building, have Ronny appear on the terrace, and get Sonia to push Ronny off. However, it turns out Ronny was aware of the plan all along as Sonia had been keeping him updated, having always been in league with him. They then plan to apparently kill Rajiv, using his own plan against him.  Things go according to plan but Sonia double-crosses Ronny and pushes him off, saying she loved him, but the money was more important. Inspector RD appears at this point to investigate the death, accompanied by his idiotic assistant Mini ([[Sameera Reddy]]). Upon his arrival, he immediately suspects foul-play in the death. During his investigation, Ronny's assistant Sophia reveals that she was married to Ronny and produces a legitimate marriage certificate. Sonia is shocked that their plan has been thwarted as Sophia is now the heir to the insurance money. In another twist, Sophia was in on the plan all along and is Rajiv's secret collaborator. Rajiv plans to bump off Sonia after he and Sophia get the insurance money. However, RD figures out during his investigation that Sophia and Rajiv had faked her marriage with Ranvir and that he had been tricked into signing the marriage certificate. RD confronts Rajiv about this and agrees to remain silent about it in exchange for $25 million.  Rajiv hires the same hitman who had attempted to murder Ronny at the beginning to kill Sonia, revealing that he had been behind the first murder attempt, too. Sonia is lured into following Rajiv and Sophia to a parking lot where the hitman attacks her.  Just as the hitman is about to kill her, Ronny reappears and rescues her, killing the hitman in the process.  Later, when Rajiv and Sophia plan to celebrate, Ronny appears and confronts them. He explains that he had overheard Rajiv discussing the failed murder attempt with the hitman and had been playing along the whole time so he could get the insurance money from his own fake-death along with the insurance money from killing Rajiv. Discovering that Rajiv's hatred towards him as a half brother was his main reason for doing this, he allows Rajiv one last chance to win by agreeing to a car race. Ranvir shows up to the race in a sports car, whilst Rajiv doesn't. When Rajiv protests, he switches cars with Ranvir. This turns out to be a trick as Rajiv had tampered with the brakes on his own car. Ronny, in turn, lies to Rajiv, claiming he had planted a bomb in his car, similar to the one that killed the jockey, and that it would be detonated if Rajiv ever slowed down below 100&nbsp;mp/h. This causes Rajiv to crash into a petroleum tank, killing him and Sophia, who had been riding with him. Ronny narrowly escapes death himself. Ronny then says that there was no bomb in the car, and that Rajiv had "killed himself".  In the end, Ronny collects the insurance money from Rajiv and Sophia's death, along with the money from his own fake-death. Upon fleeing the city, he is stopped by Inspector RD, who had been in on the plan, too, and had helped Ronny fake his death and get the insurance money. Inspector RD takes his $25 million, only to find a bomb in the bag along with the money. The bomb does not detonate, and Ronny reveals that it was a mere precaution to see if RD would try to betray him and take all the money. Ranvir rewards RD for his relative honesty by allowing him to live, and the two drive off in opposite directions while RD hopes to never meet him again.  
Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi
 Surinder "Suri" Sahni is a shy, introverted, and kind-hearted clerk-office employee for [[Punjab State Power Corporation|Punjab Power]] who falls in [[love at first sight]] with Taani, the extroverted daughter of his former Professor at her engagement, but is unable to express it. Her fiancé and his entire wedding entourage are killed in a road accident. The shocked Professor suffers a major cardiac arrest and is hospitalized. On his deathbed, fearing that Taani will be alone in the world, the dying Professor implores that Surinder marry her. Surinder silently concedes because he likes her anyway, while Taani agrees to fulfill her father's last wish.  After an impromptu wedding, Surinder takes Taani to his ancestral home in [[Amritsar]]. While his good nature leads Surinder to treat her with exceptional care&nbsp;– he even lets her have his bedroom all to herself&nbsp;– he is too frightened to profess his love for her. Taani later tells him that she will try to be a good wife and thus respect her role in his life, but that she can never love him due to having no love left within her after the loss of her former fiancé. Surinder, grateful for the increasing acts of wifely affection that Taani shows him, proceeds to indulge her wishes. These include regular evening trips to the cinema to see [[Bollywood]] movies which appeal to Taani's fantasies about romance and her passion for dancing.  Few days later, Taani finds a dancing competition poster and asks for Surinder's permission to take part in it as it would help her unwind from her mundane life at home. He grants her request and provides the entry fee. During the evenings that Surinder and Taani spend at theatres, Surinder realises it is the strong and masculine images of men that Taani admires, and later on, asks his friend, Balwinder "Bobby" Khosla, a hair-salon owner, for grooming advice that could help him win her love. Bobby gives him a complete makeoverwhich includes trimming off his mustache, changing his hairstyle to spiky, and fitting him out in a funky Western-style clothing, including aviator-style shades with oversize pastel lenses.  Surinder is thus transformed into "Raj", a name he borrows from the hero of a film that Taani admired. Raj goes to Taani's dancing competition venue to see her dance. Raj joins the competition and at the end of that dance class, all participants are put into groups of two by random numbers given by the staff, and both Surinder and Taani have the number '21'.  Despite Raj's initial over-the-top attempts to emulate the "cool" images given by heroes in films, after the first attempt of impressing Taani in that way, Taani  refuses to be his partner telling 'Raj' that he can not dance well and that she will never win the competition if he continues this way. Raj responds by imploring her that he will improve, and tells her not to worry. She reluctantly agrees and they become friends, working together on their dance routine.  Raj feels encouraged with Taani's guidance in special dance sequences, and Taani feels good to come out from the mundane home cooking-washing house wife routine. Finally, luckily and miraculously, they are both selected for the finals. It is at time, Raj can not control himself and declares his love for Taani. Taani is shocked, to say the least, and enters into a period of internal conflict.  Surinder also faces a dilemma as he can not tell Taani that he is Suri,  disguised as Raj. He thus attempts to win Taani's love as Surinder, an act which only alienates her further. He is disappointed that Taani cannot see his love for her as himself, only as 'Raj'. Later that night, Taani plans to elope with Raj. Surinder tells Bobby that he will end the charade in his own way, sacrificing his cravings for her love, leaving her his property and transferring himself to Delhi. On the day of the competition, Surinder takes Taani to the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] to gain God's blessings for her performance for that night and, internally, also for her life without 'Raj'.  While there, Taani has a realisation in which she believes God has shown her a sign that her marriage to Surinder is divinely inspired. For the first time she reflects on her husband and becomes aware of the strength and integrity of Surinder's character, something which she can grow to love. Taani thus tells Raj on the night of the competition, that she cannot choose him over her husband. She leaves him in what appears to be a state of shock with tears in his eyes. When the time comes for their performance, Taani is stunned to see Surinder instead of Raj joining her on stage. While dancing Taani puts two and two together and through a series of flashbacks, she awakens to the fact that Surinder is in fact 'Raj'.  Backstage, after their dance, she confronts Surinder, and when he confesses his love for her, she tearfully admits that she reciprocates his feelings. The two win the competition.  The film ends with Surinder and Taani visiting [[Japan]] on their honeymoon.

Kym's father, Paul, shows intense concern for her well-being and whereabouts, which Kym interprets as mistrust. Kym also resents her sister's choice of her best friend to be her [[maid of honor]] instead of her. Rachel, for her part, resents the attention her sister's [[drug addiction]] is drawing away from her wedding, a resentment that comes to a head at the [[rehearsal dinner]], where Kym, amid [[toast (honor)|toast]]s from friends and family, takes the microphone to offer an apology for her past actions, as part of her [[twelve-step program]].   Underlying the family's dynamic is a tragedy that occurred years previously, which Kym retells at a [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meeting. As a teenager, Kym was responsible for the death of her younger brother, Ethan, who was left in her care one day; driving home from a nearby park, an intoxicated Kym had lost control of the car, driving over a bridge and into a lake, where her brother drowned. The day before the wedding, as Rachel, Kym, and the other bridesmaids are getting their hair done, Kym is approached by a man whom she knew from an earlier stint in rehab. He thanks her for the strength she gave him through a story about having been [[child molestation|molested]] by an uncle and having cared for her sister, who was [[anorexia nervosa|anorexic]]. Rachel, hearing this, storms out of the hair salon. The story turns out to be a lie, an apparent attempt by Kym to evade responsibility for her addiction.   The tension between the sisters comes to a head that night at Paul's house, when Kym comes home. Rachel reveals she has never forgiven Kym for their brother's death and suggests Kym's rehab has been a hoax since she has been lying about the cause of her problems. Kym acknowledges the amount of progress she makes may never make her worthy of forgiveness. She gets into her father's car and leaves, heading to the home of their mother, Abby, hoping to find solace with her. However, Kym eventually asks Abby why she left Ethan in her care the day he died despite knowing she was a drug addict, making it clear she believes Abby is partly responsible for what happened. Abby becomes furious at this and punches Kym in the face. Kym hits her back and drives off. Heavily distraught, she drives the car off the road in an attempted suicide and crashes into a boulder. She survives and spends the night sleeping in the crashed car. The next morning, the day of the wedding, the police awaken Kym, and she gets a ride home with the driver of the tow truck that is towing the wrecked car. She makes her way to Rachel's room as Rachel prepares for the wedding.  Seeing Kym's bruised face prompts her previous anger to vanish, and Rachel tenderly bathes and dresses her sister. Amid a festive [[Culture of India|Indian]] theme, Rachel and her fiancé, Sidney, are wed. Kym is the maid of honor and overcome with emotion as the couple exchanges their vows. She tries to enjoy herself throughout the wedding reception but continues to feel out of place and is plagued by the dispute with Abby, who is also there. Ultimately, Abby leaves the reception early despite Rachel's effort to bring the two together, and the feud between Kym and Abby is left unresolved. The next morning, Kym returns to rehab.

  Amid the political protests of the [[Saffron Revolution]] in [[Burma]] (Myanmar), ruthless [[State Peace and Development Council|SPDC]] officer Major Pa Tee Tint leads an army to pillage small villages in a campaign of fear. His soldiers sadistically slaughter innocents, abduct teenage boys to be drafted into his army and hold women hostage to be raped as sex slaves. Meanwhile, twenty years [[Rambo III|after the events in Afghanistan]], John Rambo now lives in [[Thailand]], making a meager living as a snake catcher and by providing boat rides but still mourning the death of his good friend Sam Trautman. A doctor and missionary named Michael Burnett hires Rambo to use his boat to ferry their group up the [[Salween River]] into Burma on a humanitarian mission to provide medical aid to a village of [[Karen people|Karen tribespeople]].  During the trip, the boat is stopped by pirates demanding Sarah Miller, the only female in the group, in exchange for passage. Rambo is forced to kill them to protect her. Michael is greatly disturbed by Rambo's actions and upon arriving at their destination sends him back, claiming they no longer want his help. The village the missionaries are giving care to is attacked by Tint's soldiers. The missionaries are abducted and the villagers are all savagely massacred.  The pastor of the missionaries' church comes to Thailand and asks Rambo to guide a team of five mercenaries on a rescue mission. Rambo takes the mercenary team to the drop-off point and offers to help but the team leader Lewis, a former [[Special Air Service|SAS]] soldier, refuses. Myint, a [[Karen National Liberation Army|Karen rebel]] familiar with the area, leads the mercenaries to the village of the massacre. As they survey the damage, a squad of Tint's soldiers arrive in a cargo truck with a small group of hostages, intent on torturing them. Outnumbered, the mercenaries take cover and watch helplessly as the soldiers prey on their hostages. Having secretly followed the mercenaries, Rambo emerges in time to singlehandedly kill all the soldiers with his bow and arrows, allowing the hostages to escape unharmed. Rambo joins the mercenary team and they make their way to Tint's soldier's camp. They stealthily rescue the surviving American missionaries and Burmese hostages and flee under cover of night.  The next morning, Tint and his soldiers pursue them and manage to capture everyone except for Rambo, Sarah and School Boy, the mercenaries' sniper. Rambo saves them from being executed by hijacking Tint's jeep mounted with an [[M2 Browning|M2 Browning machine gun]], where he ignites a massive shootout in the jungle in which he guns down much of Tint's army and a firefight ensues between the mercenaries and Tint's soldiers. Several of the missionaries and mercenaries are killed. The Karen rebels, led by Myint, arrive and join the fight, helping to overwhelm Tint's soldiers and kill them all. After realizing his defeat, Tint attempts to escape, but Rambo intercepts and kills him by [[disembowelment|disemboweling]] him with his [[survival knife]].  Some time later, Rambo returns to the United States to finally visit his father at his home in Arizona.  
Raktamukhi Neela
 Many would presume “Raktamukhi Neela” to be a murder mystery involving some precious stones or mementos.

The villain of the film Raju Ray, who was also a seasoned actor, had a serious relation with Bipasha (the hair-dresser of the unit). Bipasha was the entity who had introduced Neela with the domain of filmdom. After the murder, when things go awry, Insp. Chakraborty begins to unravel mysteries about Neela’s past and the nature of bonding she shared with each character. He found out that Chand Kumar had a live in relation with Neela even though he was married to Manisha (Dolon Roy), another established actress. Then there was Dipika (June Maliyah) who was a newcomer full of talent and was not ready to compromise with her moralities for any reasons what so ever. There was the production-boy Prashanta, who was vested with the responsibility of supplying food and beverages on the sets. The shooting was being held at Baruipur Rajbari. Insp. Chakraborty fights to the brink for unmasking the culprit. Meanwhile Bipasha is brutally murdered in her room (she was strangled to death). While every body on the set go berserk is shock and awe, the third murder takes place. Manisha toppled from the balcony of her roof. The three murders give the nature of the case an entirely unique purview. Insp. Chakraborty investigates to unravel that Prashanta is the actual culprit. He was Neela’s actual husband. Neela dumped Prashanta and their son Babu for making a mark on celluloid. Later the penniless Prashanta (who was actually a talented chemist) fails to save his ailing son. This makes him transform to a psycho who hates all women from the silver screen. He kills Neela by giving her arsenic (which he made himself) and also whacks off the other two before targeting Dipika. But he fails and truth is revealed.

Ethan tells her that he has to go to [[Osaka]] on a business trip and may not be back for a while. Abby asks to go with him but Ethan refuses and breaks up with her. Abby goes to a [[ramen]] shop afterward, and the chef Maezumi ([[Toshiyuki Nishida]]) and his wife Reiko ([[Kimiko Yo]]) tell her that they are closed. Abby does not understand them as she does not speak Japanese. She starts to cry, so the chef conveys to her to sit down. He brings her a bowl of ramen, and she loves it. A small distance away, she hallucinates that the [[lucky cat]], known as the Maneki Neko, or Beckoning Cat, gestures to her to come over. She offers to pay for her meal, but the chef and his wife refuse.  The next day she comes back and sits down at the counter. He gives her another bowl of ramen and she eats. As she eats, she breaks into uncontrollable giggles, as does another patron. The following day she returns, but is told they are out of ramen. Seeing the wife's swollen ankles, she insists on helping instead. After the night is through, she is passed out asleep in the back. They shoo her out, but as she is walking away she realizes she wants to cook ramen. Rushing back into the store, she begs him to teach her how to cook ramen. He argues, but finally gives in and tells her to come the next day at 5. She shows up late, in high heels and a dress, and is put to work scrubbing the toilet and cleaning pots and pans. In the following weeks Maezumi only gives her cleaning work in the hopes that she quits, but she comes back. After she is given work as a waitress, she wins the hearts of all who come in, including two older women who are regular customers, and a 20-ish male laborer regular who develops a crush on her.  On a rare night off, she heads to a night club with a British man named Charlie and an American woman named Gretchen whom she met earlier. The three meet Toshi Iwamoto ([[Sohee Park]]) and his friends. Abby and Toshi fall in love. But soon, Toshi has to go to [[Shanghai, China]] for three years. He asks Abby to come with him, but she declines, saying she can't. They share their last kiss.  Abby learns during the Christmas week of someone named Shintaro. She sees Maezumi crying over a collection of letters and photos from Paris. His wife then tells Abby that Maezumi and Shintaro, their son, have not spoken in 5 years since Shintaro left for France.  Abby soon learns how to make ramen, but Maezumi insists that it has no soul. Maezumi's mother tastes her ramen and tells her, in Japanese, that she is cooking with her head; when Abby confesses that there is only pain in her heart, Maezumi's mother advises that she should put tears in her ramen, as she has no love to share. Later in the film, she is shown cooking ramen, crying. The two ladies, the 20-ish male laborer, and another 20-ish male laborer from Okinawa, taste her ramen and almost immediately become melancholic, the pain in Abby's ramen bringing out their own. Maezumi tastes it, and starts to cry, but goes upstairs to his home.  One day, Maezumi talks with a rival, who brags about his son having a master chef come to taste his ramen while ridiculing Maezumi for trying to train Abby. Maezumi, drunk, says that her ramen will receive the Master Chef's blessing, or he'll stop making ramen. The Master arrives, and tastes the young man's ramen, sampling small bits of it, very sparingly. He gives him his blessing, and goes on to Abby.  Abby has strayed from the safety of conventional ramen, and made hers with peppers, corn and tomato, a concoction she calls "Goddess Ramen". The Master says Abby's noodles are good, but he cannot give her his blessing, saying that she needs more time and restraint. Maezumi is sad to have to stop his business, but talks to Abby. He tells her about his son wanting to learn [[French cooking]], but she does not understand. He tells her that the ramen shop needs a successor, and that she is the successor of his ramen shop. She leaves for America soon, but before that, is invited to a celebration. Maezumi gives her the [[traditional lighting equipment of Japan|lantern]] that had hung outside his ramen shop for 45 years, and she takes it to America with her, where it is shown a year later outside her shop in [[New York City]], appropriately named The Ramen Girl. The shop hangs a photo of Maezumi and his wife with their son happily in Paris. Then, an employee of hers tells her about a man wanting to see her. It is Toshi.  He says he hated his job and that he decided to do what she would do: quit his job and go back to what he loved – writing music. She welcomes him to her ramen shop and they kiss.  
The Reader (2008 film)
 In 1995 [[Berlin]], after a woman who has spent the night leaves his apartment abruptly after he has made her breakfast, Michael Berg watches an [[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] pass by, setting up a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to a [[tram]] in 1958. In the flashback, the 15-year-old Michael ([[David Kross]]) gets off because he feels sick and wanders the streets, pausing in the entryway of a nearby apartment building where he vomits. Hanna Schmitz ([[Kate Winslet]]), a tram [[Conductor (transportation)|conductor]] returning home, cleans him up and helps him return home.  Michael, diagnosed with [[scarlet fever]], recuperates at home for the next three months. After he recovers, he visits Hanna with flowers to thank her.   The 36-year-old Hanna seduces him, and they begin an affair. They spend much of their time together having sex in her apartment after she has had Michael read to her from literary works he is studying. After a bicycling trip, Hanna learns she is being promoted to a clerical job at the tram company. She abruptly moves without telling Michael.  In 1966, Michael is at [[Heidelberg University]] [[Heidelberg University Faculty of Law|Law School]]. As part of a special seminar, the students observe a trial (similar to the [[Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials]]) of several women accused of letting 300 Jewish women die in a burning church when they were [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] guards on the [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]] following the 1944 evacuation of a [[concentration camp]] near [[Krakow]]. Michael is stunned that Hanna is one of the defendants.  The key evidence in the trial is the testimony of Ilana Mather ([[Alexandra Maria Lara]]), author of a memoir relating how she and her mother ([[Lena Olin]]), who also testifies, survived. She describes how Hanna had women from the camp read to her in the evenings.  Hanna, unlike her co-defendants, admits that Auschwitz was an [[extermination camp]] and that the 10 women she chose during each month's ''[[Glossary of Nazi Germany#S|Selektion]]'' were gassed. She denies authorship of a report on the church fire, despite pressure from the other defendants, but then admits it rather than comply with a demand to provide a handwriting sample.  Michael realizes Hanna's secret: she is illiterate and has concealed it her whole life. The other guards who claim she wrote the report are lying to place responsibility on Hanna. Michael informs the professor that he has information favourable to one of the defendants but is not sure what to do, since the defendant herself chose not to disclose the information. Michael arranges a visit with Hanna in prison, but once there he leaves without seeing her.  Hanna receives a life sentence for her admitted leadership role in the church deaths, while the other defendants are sentenced to four years and three months each. Michael ([[Ralph Fiennes]]), meanwhile, marries, has a daughter, and divorces. Retrieving his books from the time of his and Hanna's affair, he begins reading them into a tape recorder. He sends the cassette tapes and a recorder to Hanna. Eventually, she begins to check the books out from the prison library and teaches herself to read and write by following along with Michael's tapes. She starts writing back to Michael in brief, childlike notes, asking him to write to her. As time goes on, the letters reflect her gradually improving literacy.  Michael does not write back nor visit, but continues simply sending tapes. In 1988, a prison official ([[Linda Bassett]]) telephones him to seek his help with Hanna's transition into society after her upcoming early release for good behavior. He finds a place for her to live and a job, and finally visits Hanna a week before her release. In their meeting, Michael remains somewhat distant and confronts her about what she has learnt from her past, to which she replies, "It doesn't matter what I feel. It doesn't matter what I think. The dead are still dead", seemingly disappointing him.   Michael arrives at the prison on the date of Hanna's release with flowers only to discover that Hanna hanged herself. She has left a tea tin with cash in it with a note asking Michael to give the cash and money in a bank account to Ilana. He discovers that she killed herself out of guilt after reading Ilana's memoir relating her horrifying experience in the concentration camp.  Michael travels to New York City where he meets Ilana (now [[Lena Olin]]) and confesses his relationship with Hanna. He tells her about the suicide note and Hanna's illiteracy. Ilana tells Michael there is nothing to be learned from the camps and refuses the money.   Michael suggests that she donate the money to an organization that combats adult illiteracy, preferably a Jewish one. She replies that illiteracy is not a Jewish issue and wants him to take care of this instead. Ilana keeps the tea tin since it is similar to one stolen from her in Auschwitz.  The movie ends with Michael driving Julia, his daughter, to Hanna's grave and telling her their story.

Red Cliff (film)
 Director [[John Woo]] said in an interview with David Stratton that the film is only 50% factual. Woo decided to alter the story using modern feelings and his own feelings for a more worldly acceptance. According to Woo, historical accuracy was less important than how the audience felt about the battle.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090723083614/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s2616304.htm]</ref>  ===Part I === In the summer of 208, towards the [[End of the Han Dynasty|end of the Eastern Han dynasty]], the [[Chancellor (China)|Chancellor]], [[Cao Cao]], leads the imperial army on a campaign to eliminate the southern warlords [[Sun Quan]] and [[Liu Bei]], whom he denounces as "rebels". [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] reluctantly approves the campaign. Cao Cao's mighty army swiftly conquers [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]]. The [[Battle of Changban]] is ignited when Cao Cao's cavalry starts attacking civilians on an exodus led by Liu Bei. During the battle, Liu Bei's followers, including his [[sworn brother]]s [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]], give an excellent display of their combat skills by holding off the enemy while buying time for the civilians to retreat. The warrior [[Zhao Yun]] fights bravely to rescue Liu Bei's entrapped family but only succeeds in rescuing Liu's infant son.  Following the battle, Liu Bei's advisor, [[Zhuge Liang]], goes on a diplomatic mission to [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] to form an alliance between his lord and Sun Quan against Cao Cao. Sun Quan was initially in the midst of a dilemma of whether to surrender or fight back, but his decision to resist Cao Cao hardens after Zhuge Liang's clever persuasion and a subsequent tiger hunt with his viceroy [[Zhou Yu]] and his sister [[Lady Sun|Sun Shangxiang]]. Meanwhile, [[Cai Mao]] and [[Zhang Yun (Han Dynasty)|Zhang Yun]], two naval commanders from Jing Province, pledge allegiance to Cao Cao, who puts them in command of his navy.  After the hasty formation of the Sun–Liu alliance, the forces of Liu Bei and Sun Quan call for a meeting to formulate a plan to counter Cao Cao's army, which is rapidly advancing towards their base at Red Cliff from both land and water. The battle begins with Sun Shangxiang leading some riders to lure Cao Cao's vanguard force into the allies' [[Eight Trigrams Formation|Bagua Formation]]. The vanguard force is defeated by the allies but Cao Cao shows no disappointment and proceeds to lead his main army to the riverbank directly opposite Red Cliff, where they make camp. While the allies throw a banquet to celebrate their victory, Zhuge Liang conceives a plan to send Sun Shangxiang on an espionage mission to Cao Cao's camp. They maintain contact by sending messages via a pigeon. The film ends with Zhou Yu lighting his miniaturised battleships on a map based on the battle formation.  ===Part II === Sun Shangxiang has infiltrated Cao Cao's camp and is secretly noting its details and sending them via a pigeon to Zhuge Liang. Meanwhile, Cao Cao's army is seized with a plague of [[typhoid fever]] that kills a number of his troops. Cao Cao orders the corpses to be sent on floating rafts to the allies' camp, in the hope of spreading the plague to his enemies. The allied army's morale is affected when some unsuspecting soldiers let the plague in. Eventually, a disheartened Liu Bei leaves with his forces while Zhuge Liang stays behind to assist Sun Quan. Cao Cao is overjoyed when he hears that the alliance has collapsed. At the same time, Cai Mao and Zhang Yun propose a new tactic of interlocking the battleships with iron beams to minimise rocking when sailing on the river and reduce the chances of the troops falling seasick.  [[Image:Red Cliff.jpg|right|thumb|Sun Quan's forces look on as [[Liu Bei]] leaves the alliance. ''From right to left'': [[Zhou Yu]] ([[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai|Tony Leung]]), [[Sun Quan]] ([[Chang Chen]]), [[Lu Su]] ([[Hou Yong (actor)|Hou Yong]]).]]  Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang make plans to eliminate Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, and produce 100,000 arrows respectively. They agreed that whoever fails to complete his mission shall be executed under military law. Zhuge Liang's ingenious strategy of letting the enemy shoot 20 boats covered in straw brings in over 100,000 arrows from the enemy and makes Cao Cao doubt the loyalty of Cai Mao and Zhang Yun. On the other hand, Cao Cao sends [[Jiang Gan]] to persuade Zhou Yu to surrender, but Zhou tricks Jiang Gan into believing that Cai Mao and Zhang Yun are planning to assassinate Cao Cao . Both Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu's respective plans complement each other when Cao Cao is convinced, despite having earlier doubts about Jiang Gan's report, that Cai Mao and Zhang Yun were indeed planning to assassinate him by deliberately "donating" arrows to the enemy. Cai Mao and Zhang Yun are executed while Cao Cao realises his folly afterwards but it is too late.  Sun Shangxiang returns to base from Cao Cao's camp with a map of the enemy formation. Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang decide to attack Cao Cao's navy with fire after predicting that a special climatic condition will soon cause the winds to blow from the southeast – a direction to their advantage. Before the battle, Sun Quan's forces feast on [[Tangyuan (food)|rice dumplings]] to celebrate the [[Dongzhi Festival|Winter Solstice]]. Meanwhile, Zhou Yu's wife, [[Two Qiaos|Xiaoqiao]], heads towards Cao Cao's camp alone secretly in the hope of persuading Cao to give up his ambitious plans. She fails to convince Cao Cao and decides to distract him with an elaborate [[Chinese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] to buy time for her side.  The battle begins when the southeast wind starts blowing in the middle of the night. Sun Quan's forces launch their attack on Cao Cao's navy by ramming smaller boats that are set aflame into Cao's larger battleships. On the other hand, Liu Bei's forces, whose departure from the alliance was a ruse, start attacking Cao Cao's forts on land. By dawn, Cao Cao's entire navy has been destroyed. The allies launch another offensive on Cao Cao's ground army in his forts, and succeed in breaking through using [[testudo formation]] despite suffering heavy casualties. Although Cao Cao is besieged in his main camp, he manages to hold Zhou Yu at sword point after ambushing him with the help of [[Cao Hong]]. Xiahou Jun also shows up with Xiaoqiao as a hostage and threatens to kill her if the allies do not surrender. Just then, Zhao Yun manages to reverse the situation by rescuing Xiaoqiao with a surprise attack, while Sun Quan fires an arrow that grazes the top of Cao Cao's head and causes his hair to be let loose. Cao Cao is now at the mercy of the allies, but they spare his life and leave. In the final scene, Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang have a final conversation before Zhuge walks away into the far distance with the newborn foal Mengmeng.  ===Abridged version=== For the non-Asian releases, the film was shortened from 288 minutes to 148 minutes and was released in some countries under the title ''Battle of Red Cliff''. An opening narration in American English provides the historical background, whereas in the Asian release, a more brief description of the context of the political situation appears in scrolling form ten minutes into the film. Notable cuts include the background and motivations behind Zhuge Liang's plan to obtain 100,000 arrows, including the threat to his life, and the early parts of Sun Shangxiang's infiltration, where she befriended a northern soldier Sun Shucai (though the scene where she mourns killed Sun was not cut). The tiger hunting scene was also cut from the non-Asian releases.

The Red Baron (2008 film)
 In 1916, Manfred von Richthofen is serving as a fighter pilot with the [[Luftstreitkräfte|Imperial German Air Service]] along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. After dropping a wreath over the funeral of an Allied pilot, Richthofen and his fellow pilots Werner Voss and Friedrich Sternberg encounter a squadron of enemy aircraft led by Captain [[Lanoe Hawker]]. Richthofen shoots down Canadian pilot Arthur Roy Brown. After pulling Brown out of the wreckage of his aircraft, Richthofen assists Nurse Käte Otersdorf with a tourniquet on Brown's leg.  After killing Hawker, Richthofen is awarded the ''[[Pour le Mérite]]'' medal and promoted to command a squadron. He is joined by his brother Lothar von Richthofen ([[Volker Bruch]]). He orders his men to avoid killing enemy pilots unless absolutely necessary and is dismayed when Lothar deliberately strafes and kills a British pilot who has already been forced into a landing.  Later, during an aerial dogfight, Richthofen again encounters Captain Brown, who has escaped from a German [[prisoner of war]] camp after being nursed by Käte. Both are forced to ditch their aircraft in [[no man's land]], where they share a friendly drink. Brown expresses hope that they will not meet again until after the war is over, and he tells Richthofen that Käte has feelings for him.   On the way back to base, Richthofen is devastated to learn that his close friend, the [[German Jew|Jewish]] pilot Friedrich Sternberg, has been shot down and killed. Over the days that follow, Richthofen makes no secret of his grief and refuses to leave his room. An enraged Lothar reminds him that, "A leader cannot afford to mourn."  Shortly thereafter, Richthofen suffers a skull wound during an aerial battle, and is sent to be nursed by Käte. As he recovers, the two share a romantic dinner and a dance. After Richthofen expresses gratitude for his wound keeping him out of the fighting, an angry Käte takes him on a tour of a local field hospital, berating him for regarding war as a game.  Later, Richthofen and Käte are beginning to make love when they are interrupted by an Allied bombing raid. Determined to protect the squadron's aircraft, he orders Käte to hide in the cellar and takes to the air with his men. During the raid, Richthofen's wound begins to reopen, making him disoriented, and upon witnessing the death of his protege Kurt Wolff, he goes into a state of rage in the air.  During another visit, Richthofen informs Kate that he has been offered a rear echelon position in command of the entire Air Service. Käte is overjoyed, but a depressed Richthofen conceals his doubts. Richthofen sees he is being manipulated by the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]] and his generals. On the eve of the February 1918 offensive, he approaches General Hindenburg and tells him that the war is now unwinnable, however, Hindenburg orders him back to his squadron. Caught between his disgust for the war, and the responsibility for his fighter wing, Richthofen sets out to fly again.  As the offensive begins, Richthofen's squadron sets out to clear every Allied aeroplane and balloon out of the target area. As Käte tends the wounded on the ground, she is horrified to learn that her beloved has returned to combat. Käte confronts him and demands to know why he has turned down the chance to remain safe. Richthofen states that he will not betray the soldiers in the field. He says, "You are my greatest victory."  On April 21, 1918, Richthofen is wakened with the report of a British formation approaching the front, after making love to Käte. He has a brief talk with his pilots and tells Wolfram not to get involved in combat. As Richthofen climbs into his cockpit, he exchanges a sad smile with Käte.  Käte crosses over to Allied lines with Brown's assistance and visits Richthofen's grave. She apologises for not coming sooner and expresses remorse for never telling him how much she loved him. A funeral wreath has been left by Captain Brown, reading "To Manfred von Richtofen, Friend and Enemy."  
Red (2008 film)
 Avery "Ave" Ludlow ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]) has a dog named Red, a gift from his late wife, Mary, for his 50th birthday. One day, he is fishing at a lake with Red by his side when three boys come across his path; the brothers Danny ([[Noel Fisher (actor)|Noel Fisher]]) and Harold McCormack ([[Kyle Gallner]]), and their friend Pete Doust ([[Shiloh Fernandez]]). Danny intimidates Ave with a shotgun and tells him to give them all his money. When Avery tells them that he has only $30, Danny becomes furious and kills Red.  Ave visits a local gun store, where the clerk is able to identify Danny based on the shotgun he used. Ave meets Danny's father Michael McCormack ([[Tom Sizemore]]), and in the family study, tells his story. Michael calls his sons into the study, and in front of Ave, asks them if they shot Red. They deny the incident, and Michael tells Ave to leave.  Ave decides to file a lawsuit, and talks to his lawyer, Sam Berry ([[Richard Riehle]]). Sam discourages him by saying that the case will not do any good, but Ave persists. Sam arranges a meeting between Ave and a reporter named Carrie ([[Kim Dickens]]). Carrie tells him that if they take the story to the media, it would be helpful for their cause. Ave agrees and gives a television interview to Carrie for a human-interest piece. However, the story fails to get much attention, and Carrie's boss orders her on to another story.  Carrie asks Ave about his family; he tells her that his eldest son was a habitual liar, and was thrown out of the Navy on the basis of [[mental illness]]. One day, the son came back home and asked his mother, Mary, for money. She denied the request, and he beat his mother up. Thinking he had killed Mary, he then burnt his younger brother and Mary with [[kerosene]]. The younger brother was burnt to death, but Mary survived her wounds for five days in a coma before dying.  Ave begins to follow the boys. Harold, who sees Ave watching them and becoming remorseful for their actions, approaches Ave and apologizes for what happened, but Ave says that he would like Danny to do the same. One day, Danny is playing baseball with his friends and becomes frustrated after striking out, leaving the game in anger. Ave follows him and parks behind Danny's car. Danny confronts him and tries to hit Ave with his bat. Ave avoids the blow, striking Danny to the ground, and reminds him that, as Danny attacked in broad daylight and in open view of witnesses, it would be advisable to watch his temper in future, saying the beating he has given him is one that his father should have given to him, instead. In response, Ave's store is burned to ashes. Ave goes to his lawyer and is disappointed to hear no evidence indicates the McCormacks are responsible.  Ave digs up Red and takes his corpse to the McCormacks' house, confronting the family with Red's decaying body. Michael and Danny both brandish pistols, with the father demanding Ave leave with Red's body. Ave refuses, at which Danny becomes furious, stepping forward, aiming to shoot Ave. Ave deflects Danny's arm as he fires; however, the shot hits Ave on his ear. Ave wrestles Danny's gun from him, throws him to the ground, and holds him hostage. Telling Michael to lower his gun, Ave forces Danny to drive to the town sheriff, where he intends to have Danny charged with attempted manslaughter. Michael comes after Ave in the family pick-up, ramming his truck off the road. Leaving Ave unconscious, the McCormacks return home, thinking Ave is dead. Night falls, during which Ave comes to and sees an [[Australian Cattle Dog]] that shows him Danny's discarded revolver, left in the wreckage. He takes the revolver and returns to the McCormack house, finding a shaken Harold, smoking on the porch. Asking for Red's body back, Harold leads Ave to where the dog's body was dumped. Michael, Danny, and Pete follow and find both of them. Both Michael and Danny are armed; Harold tells them to stand down, but Danny shoots Ave in the belly with the shotgun. Ave returns fire, shooting at Danny and Michael, wounding them. As they fall, father and son fire shots and in the crossfire, both Harold and Pete are fatally shot. Ave approaches the injured Danny and Michael, telling the father that either he or his son is responsible for Harold's death.  As he heals from his wounds, Ave reads a newspaper in which his story has been published by Carrie. Carrie comes to meet him and gives him a new dog. Ave initially declines to accept it, also reminding her that two boys were killed because he wanted revenge; she leaves him alone with the new dog. Despite his protests, Ave soon becomes content with him.  
Real Time (film)
 In [[Hamilton, Ontario]], compulsive gambler Andy ([[Jay Baruchel]]) owes money to the wrong people; he perpetually blames his misfortune on "bad luck" and being "cursed". After failing to catch a cab to get to a [[Horse racing|horse race track]], Andy is approached by a car driven by Reuban ([[Randy Quaid]]), a [[Kiwi (people)|Kiwi]] [[Contract killing|contract killer]]; he orders Andy to enter the vehicle. Andy complies, attempting to explain himself, until he notices that the car's back seat holds a crate containing Andy's cat, Cleo. When Andy attempts to leave with Cleo, Reuban locks the car doors. Andy vehemently protests, but Reuban repeatedly beats him over the head with his handgun until Andy stops talking. Reuban informs Andy that he owes his debtees [[Canadian dollar|C]]$68,000 and they are angry that Andy has been bragging about not paying up; they want him dead. Reuban gives Andy one hour to "make peace".  After insisting that he be allowed to exit the vehicle to urinate, Andy attempts to escape, but slips on a patch of ice and is wrangled back into the car by Reuban. Andy then asks Reuban to take them to the corner of a prostitute (Lucy Filippone) whom he claims looks like [[Rosie Perez]]. Upon arriving, the two find that she looks nothing like Andy remembered, so they instead go to visit Andy's grandmother ([[Jayne Eastwood]]). On the way, they stop at Jollop's Chicken, a [[fast food restaurant]] that Andy worked at in high school. While ordering food for his grandma, Andy banters with the English language-challenged cashier (Ella Chan) and berates his former boss, the store manager (Jeff Pustil).  Upon arriving at his grandma's house, Andy breaks down and apologizes to his bewildered, but compassionate grandma for breaking her heart with bad behavior. Andy uses the pretense of visiting with one of her cats to retreat upstairs, where he jumps out of a window in another escape attempt. Injuring his leg in the fall, Andy limps away from Reuban, who catches him and shoots him in the leg. They return to the car as Andy's grandma watches from her front window.  On the road again, Reuban gives Andy an unmarked pill for his pain. Minutes remain until the deadline, so Reuban takes Andy to a lightly-forested clearing overlooking Hamilton. Andy becomes desperate, begging Reuban to let him live; Reuban staunchly refuses. After forcing Andy to turn away and drop to his knees, Reuban aims his gun at the back of Andy's head. Reuban tells Andy that his "bad luck" isn't luck, but the result of "stupid" choices. He goes on to define bad luck as learning that a perceived ulcer is actually a tumor, then pulls the trigger.  Andy opens his eyes to find that Reuban has committed suicide. Examining the body, Andy finds an envelope marked with his name. He retreats to the driver's seat of Reuban's car and opens the envelope. Inside is a cheque also in his name for $68,000, on the back of which is written "You're a lucky son of a bitch, Andy!". Andy stares pensively into the distance.  
Rebellion: The Killing Isle
 Four segments shot as if they are the climax of four action movies by four different directors.  
Recep İvedik
 İvedik is a fearsome-looking uncultivated driver with a lot of aggression but a spark of goodness in him. Involved by accident in a street fight, he rescues the wallet of the owner of an [[Antalya]] luxury hotel and hitchhikes his way south to restore it to the rightful owner. Along the way he is made the object of an unlikely attempted seduction by a homosexual truck-driver, reacting with shock and innocence.  Reaching the hotel to hand over the wallet, he begins his stay by shattering a porcelain vase in the hotel lobby and talks his way out of the situation in exactly the same way as earlier burlesque characters. After giving back the wallet, he is about to leave when he glimpses his childhood sweetheart Sibel (Fatma Toptaş) among a party of arriving guests and decides to take up the owner's offer of a free stay in the hotel. Gökbakar then uses İvedik to burlesque every aspect of five star hotel life. Unable to use the toilets, he pees in the ornamental flowers, drinks the hotel shampoo as well as the contents of the minibar, massages the foot of an amorous woman in mistake for Sibel's, gatecrashes  women's morning fitness exercises on the beach in a ludicrous purple gown, and cuffs the heads of almost everyone who comes into contact with him. All the while he pours out a stream of inappropriate invective and obscenities.  By the close of the film most middle class conventions have also been shattered, a high point being a burping contest between him and Sibel. Sibel, who is resisting her bourgeois mother's attempts to marry her off to a fiance she does not love, contains a very mild criticism of the middle class lifestyles and attitudes with which İvedik is colliding. By making a sweet nice girl like Sibel belch at full volume, Gökbakar comes closest to an outright repudiation of middle class values. The film ends with İvedik leaving the hotel. Has [[catharsis]] been achieved? No. İvedik departs more or less exactly as he arrived, presumably en route to more adventures in his next film. Yet somehow he ends up by being not so much frightening as slightly loveable—no doubt because he no longer appears wholly dangerous. It is Sibel's view of him which has changed—and that of the film audience too.

Redbelt
 While closing his [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] studio one evening, martial arts teacher Mike Terry ([[Chiwetel Ejiofor]]) is approached by attorney Laura Black ([[Emily Mortimer]]), who is seeking the owner of the vehicle she accidentally sideswiped. Off-duty police officer Joe Collins ([[Max Martini]]), who was receiving a private lesson from Mike, sees that Laura is distressed and tries to take her coat. Startled, Laura grabs Joe's gun and it goes off, shattering the studio's front window. To avoid having Laura charged with attempted murder, Mike and Joe agree to conceal the event.  Mike's insurance, however, will not cover his [[act of God]] claim that the window was broken by a strong wind. Mike's wife Sondra ([[Alice Braga]]), whose fashion business profits are the only thing keeping the struggling studio afloat, requests that Mike ask for a loan from her brother Ricardo (John Machado), a [[mixed martial arts]] champion. At Ricardo's nightclub, Mike meets with Sondra's other brother, Bruno ([[Rodrigo Santoro]]), and learns that Joe quit as the club's bouncer because Bruno never paid him. Mike confronts Bruno about the situation but is rebuffed. Mike then declines Bruno's offer to fight on the undercard of an upcoming match between Ricardo and Japanese legend Morisaki ([[Enson Inoue]]), which could potentially pay out $50,000. Mike believes competitions with money as the incentive are not honorable and weaken the fighter.  Meanwhile, aging Hollywood action star Chet Frank ([[Tim Allen]]) enters the nightclub without security and is accosted by a man with a broken bottle. Mike intervenes and subdues three men in the process. The following day, Mike receives an expensive watch and an invitation to dinner from Chet. Mike gives the watch to Joe to pawn in lieu of his unpaid salary at the nightclub. At the dinner party, Chet's wife Zena ([[Rebecca Pidgeon]]) arranges an informal business deal to buy a large amount of dresses from Sondra's company. Chet, impressed by Mike, invites him to the set of his current film. As Mike and Sondra leave the dinner, Mike explains his unique training method to Chet's business associate Jerry Weiss ([[Joe Mantegna]]). Before a sparring match, each fighter must draw one of three marbles, two white and one black; whoever draws a black marble has to fight with a handicap.  Mike uses his military experience to answer a few technical questions for Chet on the film set and is offered the role of co-producer. That evening, Mike faxes the details of his training methods to Jerry so they can be used in the film. Joe arrives at the studio and informs Mike that he was suspended from duty for pawning the watch, which turned out to be stolen. During their dinner that evening, Mike relays the information to Jerry who excuses himself to handle the matter, but never returns. At home, Mike learns that the phone numbers that Zena gave Sondra have been disconnected. Sondra is panicky, having borrowed $30,000 from a loan shark to order the fabric for the dresses. As he meets with the loan shark to discuss an extension, Mike notices Bruno and Marty Brown ([[Ricky Jay]]) on television using Mike's marble-drawing method as a promotional gimmick for the undercard fights of Ricardo's match.  Mike hires Laura to sue, but Marty's lawyer threatens that if they do not drop the lawsuit, he will give the police an empty shell casing with Laura's fingerprints, as proof that she attempted to kill an off-duty cop. He also threatens Mike as a witness who covered up the crime by bribing the cop with a stolen watch. When told of the situation, Joe feels responsible and kills himself. Mike feels obligated to help Joe's financially struggling wife and, in desperate need of money himself, decides to compete as an undercard fighter in the upcoming competition.  At the arena, Mike discovers the fights are being fixed via a magician ([[Cyril Takayama]]) using [[sleight of hand]] to surreptitiously switch the white and black marbles. Disgusted by this revelation, Mike confronts the conspirators: Marty, Jerry and Bruno who confirm that unknown to the competitors, the fights are handicapped by the fight promoters so as to ensure winning bets. They also reveal that Ricardo is intentionally losing the fight to Morisaki so they can make money on the rematch. Jerry tells Mike that Sondra is the one who told them about Laura shooting the window and Bruno justifies her betrayal by explaining that his sister is too smart to stay with someone who cannot provide for her.  As Mike is exiting the arena, he meets Laura. Their conversation is not audible, but it ends with Laura slapping Mike. Mike then re-enters the arena. He incapacitates several security guards trying to stop him and is ultimately engaged by Ricardo. The audience and camera crews take notice as Mike and Ricardo face off in the arena's corridors. Inspired by the Professor ([[Dan Inosanto]]), an elderly martial arts master attending the match, Mike manages to slip a difficult choke hold and defeats Ricardo, making it onto the ring to speak to the Professor personally. He is approached by Morisaki, who offers Mike his ivory-studded belt, previously referred to as a Japanese national treasure, as a sign of respect. He is then approached by the Professor himself, who proceeds to award the coveted red belt to an incredulous Mike, and embraces him, acknowledging his dedication to the art.  
The Red Sense
  The film is a mystery story set in Cambodia in the Khmer Rouge era.  
Repo! The Genetic Opera
  By the year 2056, an epidemic of organ failures has devastated the planet. The [[megacorporation]] GeneCo provides [[organ transplants]] on a payment plan. Clients who default on payments are hunted down by Repo Men: skilled assassins contracted by GeneCo to repossess organs, usually killing the clients in the process. The CEO of GeneCo, Rottissimo "Rotti" Largo (as listed in a newspaper article about his kids), discovers he is terminally ill. Rotti's three children, Luigi Largo, Pavi Largo, and Amber Sweet (Carmela Largo), who changed her name to help her become a popular singer, bicker over who will inherit GeneCo. Rotti believes none of his children are worthy heirs, as they consistently embarrass him with their robust attitudes, and instead plans to pass on his fortune to Shilo, the daughter of his ex-fiancé Marni.  Meanwhile, 17-year-old Shilo Wallace longs to explore the outside world. She is constantly reminded by her overprotective father Nathan that she has inherited a rare blood disease from her deceased mother Marni which requires her to stay indoors. She secretly visits her mother's tomb and runs into GraveRobber, who is digging up bodies to drain Zydrate, a euphoric and extremely addictive pain-killer made by GeneCo that is secreted from dead bodies.  He sells it on the street to keep up with his GeneCo payments. After losing consciousness, Shilo wakes up to find herself at home with Nathan. Nathan prepares for work, not as the doctor he has led Shilo to believe he is, but as the head Repo Man for GeneCo. Nathan believes he killed Marni with a treatment he created for her illness. In truth, Rotti poisoned Marni's medicine behind Nathan's back as revenge for Marni leaving him. Rotti blackmails Nathan, agreeing to keep him out of jail and with his then-newborn daughter Shilo if he performs surgical repossessions for the company.  Rotti lures Shilo to the GeneCo 1st Annual post-plague Italian Renaissance Fair with the promise of a cure for her blood disease. There she finds the Largo brothers arguing about their father's will, while their sister harasses Blind Mag, GeneCo's opera singer and celebrity spokesperson. Mag uses surgically enhanced eyes but works for Rotti indefinitely as a result, having been tricked into signing her contract in blood pre-surgery. After introducing her to Mag, Rotti stations his Genterns to guard Shilo. He then announces that Mag will soon give the last GeneCo-sponsored performance of her career. GraveRobber helps Shilo escape the fairgrounds. As they hurry through the city, GraveRobber encounters several of his customers including the surgery addict Amber, who has skipped the fair she was supposed to speak at, once again publicly embarrassing her father. Under the stupor of the drug, she explains that she will be replacing Blind Mag after her eyes are repossessed following the opera. After GeneCops arrive, GraveRobber and Shilo part ways and she quickly returns to her room before Nathan notices she was gone.  Rotti hires Nathan to repossess Mag's eyes but Nathan refuses, citing Mag's close relationship to Marni. He quits his repo job mid-surgery, telling Rotti, "I cannot do this job. Find someone else." This angers Rotti and he vows to have Nathan taken out. Mag arrives at Shilo's house and reveals she is Shilo's godmother. Mag states she was unaware Shilo was even alive, Nathan having told her she died with her mother. She cautions Shilo to not make the same mistakes she did. Nathan arrives home and forces Mag out after she scolds him for lying to her about Shilo's death. Meanwhile, back at GeneCo, Rotti writes down his will, ready to make Shilo his sole beneficiary with his signature.  Rotti phones Shilo and invites her to the Opera, delivering her mother's burial dress for her to wear. Nathan finds the GeneCops searching his basement. They try to arrest Nathan, but he quickly dispatches them and heads to the opera looking for Shilo. At the opera, Amber takes the stage for her premiere, but her performance is ruined when her transplanted face falls off. Mag takes to the stage and sings her final song. She deviates from the song's grand finale, denouncing the Largo family and gouging out her eyes in a final act of defiance. Rotti cuts the cords suspending Mag, dropping and impaling her on a fence. Rotti assures everyone that Mag's death is part of the performance and convinces the audience to stay seated.  Shilo sees a Repo Man arrive and attacks him with a shovel before realizing the Repo Man is her father. Onstage, Rotti reveals that Shilo does not have a blood disease but that Nathan has been making her ill with the "medicine" he insists that she take. Unable to deal with the loss of Marni, Nathan explains he was trying to keep Shilo safe from the world. Approaching death's door, Rotti tells Shilo that she will inherit GeneCo if she kills her father. When she refuses, Rotti uses the last of his strength to shoot Nathan. Rotti then dies from his terminal illness and Nathan dies with one last farewell to Shilo. Shilo then leaves, deciding that her father's murderous tendencies do not dictate her future and that she is "free at last" to live her own life. Since she didn't kill her father, though, Rotti has not signed his will and GeneCo does not belong to her.  In the epilogue, GraveRobber claims that Shilo fled, leaving GeneCo with no legal heir. A [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]] reveals that Amber became GeneCo's new CEO and promised to change the repossession policy.  
Remember the Daze
 The film takes place in a small [[suburban]] town in North Carolina in 1999. It's the last day of school and kids just want to have fun. That, at least, is the plan.  
Resident Evil: Degeneration
 On November 2005, Harvardville Airport falls victim to a T-virus attack both from inside the terminal and a crashlanded airline plane. TerraSave worker Claire Redfield coincidentally runs into Senator Ron Davis; they are forced to hide in the VIP lounge with Rani, niece of a TerraSave employee. By nightfall, the airport has been locked down by the local [[Special Weapons and Tactics|Special Response Team]] and the [[United States Marine Corps]], aiding evacuated survivors. Officers Angela Miller and Greg Glenn are joined by federal agent Leon S. Kennedy. Claire's group is rescued; however, they are forced to leave the infected Greg. Trucks from WilPharma arrive to administer the T-vaccine, but are destroyed by explosives. Leon reveals that a terrorist has threatened to unleash the T-virus throughout the U.S. should government officials involved in its creation not be revealed by midnight.  Claire accompanies WilPharma Head Researcher Frederic Downing to their Harvardville research facility. Downing reveals plans to make a G-virus vaccine next, angering Claire because of its extreme danger. Excusing himself, Downing leaves Claire in his office. Claire informs Leon about what Downing told her, and learns that he and Angela have found the house of her brother Curtis on fire. Downing phones Claire, warning her about a man who has activated a time bomb. Claire briefly spots Curtis in the building's central garden, only for the bomb to detonate.  Leon and Angela arrive at the facility and split up, Leon reunites with Claire, while Angela reunites with Curtis. Curtis reveals the American government's involvement in covering up Raccoon City's destruction. Having injected the G-virus, he mutates and kills a squad of marines. Leon saves Angela as the atrium garden begins to fall apart, with the wreckage temporarily crushing Curtis.  The computer system then incinerates the building in order to prevent the viruses from spreading. Angela and Leon jump into a pool of water to avoid being incinerated. After shooting a glass partition to avoid drowning, the two find themselves in an underground area. Meanwhile, Claire makes it to the command center, attempting to halt a [[Biological hazard|biohazard]] alarm and open the building. However, the detection of Curtis triggers an outbreak containment method in which the laboratory falls into the abyss.  Curtis attacks them, seeing Leon as a threat and Angela as a mate. Curtis briefly regains control, telling Angela to run before losing himself again. As the sections are ejected, Leon and Angela evade Curtis, only to hang from a broken catwalk. About to fall, Curtis grabs hold of Angela's leg but is shot in the head by Leon, and falls to his death. In the aftermath, Claire accuses Senator Davis of orchestrating everything in order to improve WilPharma stock. Leon reveals Davis is innocent; making Claire realize that Downing is the actual mastermind of the T-vaccine's destruction, the bombing of the research building, and the recent [[bioterrorism]] incidents. Meanwhile, Downing talks to General Grandé, a client of his eager to buy the T-virus now that news reports have revealed its potential, though he warns against using the G-virus. Waiting for a contact to sell WilPharma information to, Downing mistakes a car containing Leon and Claire for his contact; soon after, he is arrested by the police for his crimes.  The next day, Leon and Claire meet with a despondent Angela. Leon reveals Downing confessed to being a former [[Umbrella Corporation|Umbrella]] researcher who stole both viruses and escaped prior to [[Resident Evil 2|the Raccoon City incident]] and created his current identity. Downing used his alias to sell the viruses to a list of potential customers while researching the vaccine. Angela realizes Downing manipulated Curtis, but Claire notes that even though this does not clear his name, he wants to prevent another Raccoon City just like she, Leon, and Angela do.  Meanwhile, news reports reveal Davis has resigned from office over allegations of [[Insider trading|insider stock trading]] with WilPharma stocks. A newspaper draped over Davis' face reveals that another company, [[Resident Evil 5|Tricell Incorporated]], has offered to purchase the now-bankrupt WilPharma. At this point, Davis is revealed to have been assassinated by Tricell, with the company deleting all of Davis's computer files on WilPharma and recovering G-Virus samples from Curtis's corpse.  
Return to Sleepaway Camp
 Alan (Michael Gibney) is a boy who is at a [[summer camp]]. The movie shows that Alan is a bully, who in turn is bullied by other kids. Among his abusers are his stepbrother Michael (Michael Werner) and his friends Vinny (Christian Hess) and T.C. (Christopher Shand), and the girls at the camp, mainly a girl named Bella (Shahidah McIntosh). Several boys are [[Fart lighting|lighting farts]] one night. Alan tries, and after failing, he threatens the other boys, but is soon stopped by camp counselor, Randy (Brye Cooper). In the dining hall, Alan gets into a violent confrontation with Randy after he complains about the food. Ronnie (Paul DeAngelo), a counselor (from the original) who is nice to everyone including Alan, allows Alan to get something else to eat, but Alan gets in trouble with cook Mickey ([[Lenny Venito]]). Alan throws a butcher knife at Mickey and the camp owner, Frank ([[Vincent Pastore]]), argues with Alan. Alan runs away, with Michael chasing him. In the kitchen, Mickey is killed after being held above and dumped into the deep fryer. His body is dumped in the [[Compactor|trash compactor]].  During the [[Party|social]], Alan is fooled by campers Terry ([[Adam Wylie]]), [[nicknamed]] "Weed", and Stan (Chas Brewer) into smoking dried [[Cow dung|cow manure]], which makes him cough and falls on Stan's crotch, earning him the nickname "[[Fellatio|Blowjob]]." After the social, Weed is tied to a chair and gasoline is squirted down his throat. The killer sticks a lit cigarette in his mouth and his insides explode. Ronnie suspects the [[Sleepaway Camp|murders that happened twenty years ago]] are happening again, but Frank states the murders were accidental. A week later, Alan manages to convince two girls, Karen ([[Erin Broderick]]) and Marie (Samantha Hahn), to go to his "secret hideout". Michael makes Alan look like he skinned frogs, and Karen and Marie run away. Alan catches up to Karen to try and explain what happened, but T.C. gives Alan a [[wedgie]] and he falls in the water. Later that night Michael, T.C. and Marie force Karen to lure Alan to the back of the stage, where they take his clothes off, tie him up, blindfold him and embarrass him at the social.  Ronnie suspects that counselor Petey (Kate Simses) is the killer for always being nearby when Alan is in trouble. After returning to his cabin, Frank is knocked unconscious with a hammer and wakes up with his head inserted in a birdcage. The killer opens the birdcage and places two rats inside the cage. The rats eat through his head and down into his intestines. Randy and his girlfriend Linda ([[Jackie Tohn]]) go to the [[Pumping station|pump house]] to have sex. Whilst Randy urinates, the killer ties him to a tree, using fishing line to wrap around his penis. Upon returning, Linda panics after hearing Randy placate the killer and drives off in the jeep, but the fishing line is tied to the jeep and tears off Randy's penis. Linda crashes after driving through a wrapped barbed wire line, which wraps around her face.  After Vinny visits T.C., a wooden spear comes through a hole in the floor while T.C. is looking into it and impales him through the eye. Ronnie and another camper, Jenny (Jaime Radow), find Frank dead and begin rounding up everyone. Bella goes to her cabin, where she finds that the bunk above her has been replaced with a board with spikes. The killer jumps down from the rafters and lands on the top bunk, causing the spikes to impale and kill Bella. T.C. and Bella are found dead and Ricky Thomas ([[Jonathan Tiersten]]), Angela's cousin, is called by Sheriff Jerry. Karen runs through the camp. She finds Randy and Linda dying before bumping into the killer and fainting.  Karen wakes up with a rope hanging from a basketball hoop tied around her neck. The killer flips a switch to raise the net, causing Karen to be lifted off the ground. Michael arrives, causing the killer to run off, and lowers the net. After Karen tells him she thinks Alan is the killer, Michael grabs a [[croquet mallet]] and runs to Alan's secret hideout, where he finds Alan, and starts beating Alan with the mallet. However, the real killer appears behind Michael as the screen fades to black.  Ronnie, Ricky and Jenny find a badly wounded Alan. Sheriff Jerry walks up, explaining through his mechanical voice box that the victims never learned, were always so mean all the time, could do whatever they want and get away with it, and they got what they deserved. The killer is revealed to be Sheriff Jerry, who in turn reveals himself to be the real Angela Baker,the murderer from the first movie, which causes Ronnie to say "I knew it was you". Jenny finds something on the ground and runs away screaming. Ronnie and Ricky investigate and find Michael skinned alive on the ground. The film ends with Angela laughing maniacally before suddenly stopping and staring evilly into the camera.  Following the credits, three weeks prior to film, Angela escaped from the psychiatric clinic. She causes a brake fluid leak in a car and flags down Sheriff Pete (Carlo Vogel), the real sheriff. She murders him by dropping the car on his head and steals his clothes to become the new sheriff.  
Restraint (film)
 Two fugitives from justice, Dale ([[Teresa Palmer]]) and Ron ([[Travis Fimmel]]), take hostage Andrew ([[Stephen Moyer]]), an [[agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] art dealer who might have a dark past of his own.  All three soon find themselves participants in a game of survival.  Before the narrative begins, Ron has killed Dale's boss, the owner of a strip club. On the run, the couple kill a gas station attendant who sees the body in the trunk of their car.  Stumbling across Andrew's magnificent country estate, the couple plan to hide out there until the search for them abates.  Ron, impulsive and out of control, abuses and threatens to kill Andrew, but Dale intervenes.  Andrew proposes to give them AU 40,000 dollars and valuable jewelry to aid their getaway. Someone, though, must go to the bank to retrieve the goods. Andrew suggests Dale do it, posing as his fiancée, Gabrielle. Dale, as Gabrielle, drives to town and twice enters the bank without creating suspicion.  While Dale is gone, Andrew tells Ron that Gabrielle had left him after having an affair with his father and being paid by him to leave; he subsequently hired a hit man to kill his father.  To persuade Ron to leave him alive, he offers leverage in the form of a photo that proves he had his father killed.  While allegedly retrieving the photo, Andrew manages to lock Ron in the cellar, but Ron escapes and regains the upper hand.  Dale returns and the couple prepare to leave.  Ron again makes a move to kill Andrew; Dale, who has been partly seduced by Andrew and his way of life, grabs their shotgun and shoots at Ron, without realizing that he has left the gun unloaded.  Ron knocks Dale out and leaves her in a locked car filling with exhaust, sadistically goading Andrew into braving his agoraphobia in order to save her.  Andrew manages to save her and wound Ron; reviving, Dale deals Ron a death blow.  With Ron dead, Andrew moves to call the police.  Dale stops him by re-assuming her pose as Gabrielle, and, prompted by Andrew, by telling him in Gabrielle's voice that she loves him. They  make love—again, with Dale coached to speak in Gabrielle's voice.  Afterwards, Dale asks Andrew what would happen if Gabrielle came back while she's impersonating her. Andrew assures her Gabrielle is "gone", as we see him burning Gabrielle's passport, ambiguously suggesting he actually killed her. Later, Andrew plays Wagner downstairs alone and seems to celebrate, while Dale gazes forlornly out the house's top-floor window.  
Revanche (film)
  Alex works in [[Vienna]] for Konecny, owner of the brothel "Cinderella", where Tamara, a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] prostitute, also works. Konecny has a possessive attitude towards Tamara, not realizing that she and Alex are in a secret relationship and want to leave Vienna as soon as possible to begin a new life together. While visiting his grandfather Hausner, who lives on a smallholding in the country, Alex decides to rob the local bank. Hausner has a neighbour, Susanne, who lives nearby, and visits him regularly. She is married to Robert, a policeman. They keenly want a child, but although Susanne was pregnant, she lost the baby and is unable to conceive a second time because of Robert's fertility problems. Susanne would like to adopt, but Robert refuses to accept that there is any difficulty in his fathering children. Consequently, their relationship is suffering.  Tamara has a bad feeling about Alex's planned bank robbery, and insists on waiting for him in the getaway car while Alex, armed and masked, holds up the bank. By chance, Robert is on patrol and walks past the car at the moment Alex is returning to it. Alex threatens him with his gun and drives off. Robert shoots at the tires as it speeds away but instead hits Tamara fatally. In despair, Alex abandons the car and Tamara's body in the wood and makes his way to Hausner's farm, where he hides out. His loss makes him very withdrawn and distraught; he scarcely speaks, and spends hours every day aggressively chopping wood for the winter. Hausner begins playing the accordion a great deal with encouragement by Susanne, who visits often, adding to Alex's growing unease.  Robert and Susanne's relationship becomes further strained because Robert's unintentional killing of Tamara is causing him great mental anguish. He blames himself for it and can find no way to discuss or deal with the guilt. He carries Tamara's photo round with him, and looks at it constantly. His colleagues refuse to take his grief seriously, and try to encourage him by telling him that he has only killed a bank robber's accomplice, and that in the forthcoming official inquiry into the death he will have nothing to worry about.  While they are shopping Alex and Hausner meet Susanne, who tells them about the bank robbery and that it was her husband who shot at the car. This has an effect on Alex. On her visits to Hausner, Alex has scarcely reacted at all to the extremely talkative Susanne and, when he does, is very dismissive, although this has apparently not bothered her. Under cover of darkness, he now starts to spy on the couple in their house and follows Robert when he goes jogging in the woods. After one of her visits to Hausner, Alex speaks to Susanne bluntly and tries to discourage her from returning. This seems not to trouble her: she invites him to her house, and says that she will be alone that evening. Alex appears not to react to the invitation but that evening suddenly turns up at her terrace door and startles her, until she realises that it is "only Alex." She offers him a glass of wine. While Susanne talks brightly but nervously in an uninterrupted stream, Alex looks depressed and is almost silent. After a while he asks her why she wants to have sex with him. To his astonishment Susanne participates willingly in an almost brutal sex act, which seems to offer Alex a vent for his accumulated aggression. When he goes to take a shower he sees the nursery that Suzanne and Robert have set up in their house, but Susanne refuses to discuss it. As he is leaving she asks if he wants to come again.  The next time Alex sees Robert jogging in the woods, he draws his gun and aims it at Robert's back, but does not fire it. Alex later meets Susanne again while shopping. She tells him that she will be alone again that evening and that she wants him to visit her, which he does. She asks him whether he has a girlfriend, and he tells her that until recently he used to have, but that she was murdered, and that now he thinks day and night about killing the murderer. Susanne protests that he cannot do such a thing, and must not even think about it. But she understands now why Alex is so cold, and takes him to bed. In the night Susanne is wakened by the sound of a car engine. Robert has come home, and she urges Alex, lying next to her, to go. Robert, crying, tells Susanne that he has been declared unfit for duty and suspended from the police force. He shows her Tamara's photo, which he is unable to stop looking at. As Susanne goes to throw it away, she sees Alex leaving the house.  Some days later Alex is sitting on a bench by the lake in the woods and waiting for Robert. He jogs past, and sits on the bench with Alex. In the course of their conversation the subject of the bank robbery arises. Robert tells how the death of the young woman has preyed on his mind, and how he was aiming to shoot the tires. Alex asks if Robert is not afraid that the robber will come and shoot him, out of revenge. Robert's only comment is a resigned "He's welcome to."<ref>„Soll er ruhig“.</ref> He gets up to leave but pauses to add that he would like to ask the bankrobber why he took the woman with him in the first place: "the whole mess wouldn't have happened if the woman hadn't been in that car without any reason."<ref>„Die ganze Scheiße wäre nicht passiert, wenn die Frau nicht sinnlos im Auto gesessen wäre“.</ref> When Robert is out of sight, Alex throws his gun into the lake. That evening Susanne tells her husband that at last she is pregnant.  On Sunday Susanne calls again to take Hausner to church, but he is in hospital and only Alex is at home. She asks him to consider their affair at an end, and not to tell her husband about it, and Alex promises this. Susanne then sees Alex's photo of Tamara on the table, and in a moment of insight the connections suddenly become clear to her. At the end the two come to an understanding. The last scene is of Alex collecting fallen apples into a big basket.

  In 1972, a family in a motorhome encounters the Driver (Brionne Davis) standing on the side of the road next to the yellow pickup, out of gas.  Once in the R.V., the Mother begins to flirt heavily with the Driver, asking Scotty, her physically deformed child, to take a picture with his camera.  Later that night, the Father finds the Driver having [[sexual intercourse]] with his wife.  His wife then claims she is being raped (which she was not) and prompts her husband to attack, torture, and kill the Driver. The Driver's ghost later kills the family across the street from the rest stop.  35 years later and one year after Jesse and Nicole disappeared. In Argyle, Texas, Jesse's brother Tom (Tillman) returns from [[Iraq]].  Tom decides to go looking for his brother with his girlfriend Marilyn (Ward) and one of Nicole's friends, Jared (Norris), who has had a long time crush on Nicole.  Once they get to [[California]], the trio asks direction from a strange gas station attendant (Steve Railsback).  Jared finds a horseriding badge that belonged to Nicole, prompting Tom to demand information from the attendant, who tells them that the Old Highway is a mile up the road.  Not long afterwards, Jared stops at a construction site porta-potty which the Driver rams into, covering Jared in feces causing him to strip down to his briefs. Tom and Marilyn arrive at the rest stop where, while Marilyn is using the bathroom, Tom is kidnapped by the Driver.  Inside the bathroom, Marilyn sees Nicole's ghost (Julie Mond),  in an adjacent stall.  She rushes out of the bathroom to look for Tom, but all signs of him and their truck are vanished.  As night falls, Jared changes clothes (they got covered in feces during the Driver's attack) and as he gets in his car sees Nicole's ghost, which he believes is real.   They then have sex during while Nicole vomits blood and disappears.  Jared then runs into the road and comes across the R.V. family, who give him a ride to the rest stop.

Meanwhile, Tom is being tortured by the Driver in the school bus, but escapes while the Driver is gone.  He searches for his brother, finding him tied up in a cage.  He frees him and carries him to his truck.  Jesse turns to his brother and says "you should have saved me?" before disappearing, leaving Tom confused before heading back to the rest stop.  Marilyn and Jared learn from the attendant that to put the Driver to rest, they need to burn his eyeballs.  But the Driver set a trap for them.  When Jared awakes, The Driver claims, using the attendant to talk for him, that Marilyn was unfaithful to Tom and needed to be "cleansed".  Jared refuses and has his right eye cut out by the Driver.  Jared then gives in and uses a drill to "cleanse" Marilyn by drilling into her thighs.  Tom arrives at the gas station to find Marilyn alone.  They exit the station, just as day breaks, to find the aged and abandoned motorhome parked outside.  Scotty tells them that the twins have the Driver's eyeballs.  Tom loads up with an assault rifle he kept in his backseat to take on the Driver.  Marilyn finds Jared inside the R.V. with a patch on his eye.  He assists her in setting fire to the motorhome, destroying it.  Just before the Driver kills Tom, he disappears as the motorhome explodes.  On the way home, Jared discovers a picture of Nicole that he kept on his visor is missing.  Just as he tries to tell Tom, he smashes into the motorhome.  Sometime later that day, Tom ponders Jared's disappearance and emotes to Marilyn, who is crying next to him.  When Tom asks what is wrong, Marilyn responds, "You should have saved me."  Tom begins to ask what she is talking about, only to be interrupted by the Driver revving his engine.  Tom looks out the window and into the truck's cab, seeing Marilyn in the passenger's seat next to the Driver.  Tom rushes out onto the empty highway and looks around, realizing that Marilyn is dead.  The Driver is then seen driving down a different highway.  
Return to Hansala
 At the beginning of this decade the bodies of eleven young Moroccan immigrants who were trying to cross the Straight appeared on the beaches of [[Rota, Cádiz|Rota]]. From their clothes, it was discovered that they all came from the same village, Hansala. The film tries to portray that event through the eyes of Martín, a funeral parlor owner who tries to make money on their deaths, and Leila, the sister of one of the dead boys. Together, they adventure into trying to repatriate the boy’s body by van and live an intense moral experience that will lead them to question their beliefs.  The film begins with several bodies washing up on the Spanish shore, Playa Getares, near the coastal town of Algeciras. One of them is the younger brother of Leila, a refugee living in the town. She had encouraged him to risk the boat crossing to Spain, against their family’s wishes. After identifying her brother, Leila decides to repatriate his body, and face the wrath of her parents. Teaming up with a Spanish undertaker Martin, the pair embark on the hazardous trip to Leila’s mountain village of Hansala in the Moroccan countryside. Leila’s most fundamental beliefs are challenged, as she must face her family, and their grief, anger and love. Martin meanwhile is surprised by his welcome in the village. Director Chus Gutierrez presents with great sensitivity the opposing viewpoints of her main protagonists, artfully, contrasting the lives of rich and poor, separated by only a few hundred miles.

The couple becomes close friends with their [[realtor]] Helen Givings (Bates) and her husband Howard Givings ([[Richard Easton]]), and neighbor Milly Campbell ([[Kathryn Hahn]]) and her husband Shep ([[David Harbour]]). To their friends, the Wheelers are the perfect couple, but their relationship is troubled. April fails to make a career out of acting, while Frank hates the tedium of his work. Meanwhile, Helen asks the couple to meet her son, John (Shannon), who had been declared insane, to try to help better his condition. They accept.  April wants new scenery and a chance to support the family so Frank can find his passion, so suggests that they move to [[Paris]] to start a new life away from the "hopeless emptiness" of their repetitive lifestyle.  The Givings (including John) talk with April and Frank. During the conversation, the Wheelers tell the Givings about their plans to live in Paris. Surprisingly, the only person who seems to comprehend their decision is John.  As the couple prepares to move, they are forced to reconsider. Frank is offered a promotion, and April becomes pregnant again. When Frank discovers she is contemplating having an abortion, he is furious and starts screaming at April, leading to a serious altercation, in which April says that they had their second child only to prove the first child was not a "mistake".  The next day, Frank takes the promotion and tries to accept his uneventful life. At the end of an evening at a jazz bar with the Campbells, Shep and April end up alone together and have sex in the car. Shep professes his long-held love for April, but she rejects his interest.  The following day, Frank confesses to having had an affair with a female assistant at his office, hoping to reconcile with April. To his surprise, April responds apathetically and tells him it does not matter as her love for him has gone, which he does not believe. The Givings come over for dinner, and Frank announces to the guests that their plans have changed, as April is pregnant. John harshly lambasts Frank for crushing April's hope, as well as his acceptance of his circumstances. Angered, Frank nearly attacks John, and the Givings hurry out. Afterwards, Frank and April have a severe verbal altercation, after which April flees the house.  Frank spends the night in a drunken stupor.  The next morning he is shocked to find April in the kitchen, calmly making breakfast as if nothing happened. Frank, unsure of how to react, eats with her then leaves for work.  April goes upstairs and performs a [[vacuum aspiration]] abortion. Afterwards, she discovers herself bleeding and calls an ambulance.

A new couple, the Braces, buys the house and  Milly tells the story of the Wheelers to them. Shep stops the story and walks out of the house, crying. When Milly asks Shep what is wrong, he asks her in return to never talk about the Wheelers ever again.  Helen talks to her husband years later about how the Braces seem to be the best-suited couple for the Wheelers' old house. When her husband mentions the Wheelers, Helen starts to talk about why she did not like them. As she continues talking about all of the things that she did not like about them, her husband turns off his hearing aid.  
Righteous Kill
 Police psychologists review recordings of a man ([[Robert De Niro]]), who states his name as Detective David Fisk, the "Poetry Boy" killer. The Poetry Boy earned the moniker for his [[modus operandi]] of murdering criminals and leaving short poems with their bodies. Fisk reveals that he looks up to his partner of almost 30 years, Detective Tom Cowan (who the audience is led to believe is the character portrayed by [[Al Pacino]]), and considers him to be his role model of how a cop should be. Pacino's character is known by the nickname "Rooster" and De Niro's by "Turk," and they are referred as such outside of the recordings.  These recordings provide a narrative, and the film opens with the tenth victim, a drug dealer named Robert "Rambo" Brady ([[Rob Dyrdek]]). Turk and Rooster investigate the murder with the less-experienced Detectives Karen Corelli ([[Carla Gugino]]), Simon Perez ([[John Leguizamo]]), and Ted Riley ([[Donnie Wahlberg]]). When they find a poem on the body, the cops link it to Poetry Boy.  As Poetry Boy murders acquitted rapist Jonathan Van Luytens and Father Connell, a Catholic priest and [[child sexual abuse|child molester]] (whose victims included Poetry Boy himself), tensions escalate between Turk, Corelli, and Perez. Turk is now living with Corelli, who happens to be Perez's ex-girlfriend. Poetry Boy assaults an attempted fourteenth victim, Russian mobster Yevgeny Magulat (who survives), and goes on to shoot at Perez's house and [[rape]] Corelli. Perez and Riley suspect Turk of being Poetry Boy due to his markmanship skills and psych evaluations, so they arrange a secretly supervised meeting between Turk and suspected drug dealer Marcus "Spider" Smith ([[50 Cent]]), during which Turk supposedly must kill him. Turk proves his innocence during an encounter with this drug dealer as he has the "wrong" gun and humiliating but obviously inappropriate poem. After Perez and Riley leave the scene unsatisfied, Rooster kills Spider. During this scrape, Rooster inadvertently drops his journal.  Turk stumbles upon and reads Rooster's journal; Rooster claims Spider as Poetry Boy's fourteenth victim. Rooster puts Turk in front of a video camera and forces him to read the journal. At this point, it is revealed that the narration set Turk up as a [[red herring]], and Rooster is the actual Poetry Boy. Turk's name is actually Tom Cowan, and Rooster's is David Fisk. Rooster lost his faith in the justice system when Turk planted a gun at the house of acquitted child molester and murderer Charles Randall ([[Frank John Hughes]]), convicting him. This leads Rooster to take the law into his own hands as the serial killing vigilante known as Poetry Boy.  When Turk finishes, he chases Rooster to a construction site. Rooster fires aimlessly to convince Turk to report that the Poetry Boy is assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest, and fleeing, but Turk resists. When Rooster takes aim at Turk, Turk fires, striking Rooster in the chest. Turk calls for an ambulance, but Rooster begs for the call to be canceled. After some hesitation, Turk calls off for paremedics, allowing Rooster to succumb to his wounds. He is last shown coaching a [[Police Athletic League]] baseball team as Corelli looks on.

Roadside Romeo
 Romeo is a dog who once lived in luxurious surroundings. One day his owners decide to migrate to [[London]] and he is left at the mercy of the servant of the house, who dumps him on the streets of [[Mumbai]]. Left to fend for himself, he is soon cornered by the local gang – Guru, Interval, Hero English and a dog-wannabe-cat, Mini, who tell him that this is their domain. Romeo does not know the street lingo and is at a loss for words at first, but he manages to win the gang over with giving them haircuts. They love their new looks and accept Romeo as part of their gang. Together, they set up a successful dog-grooming business until Chhainu, the right-hand of gangster-dog Charlie Anna, arrives to collect "weeklies" (weekly [[protection money]]) in the form of bones. Romeo throws Chhainu out, and the others, terrified, go to Charlie to plead their case. Charlie threatens them with his trio of female ninja dogs, whom he calls his Angels, but Romeo tricks Charlie into allowing his friends to leave unhurt.  Romeo then meets Laila, who is singing from a rooftop, they dance and he falls in love. To win her over, Laila tells Romeo he must dance with her in front of everyone at the "Moonlight Club" where she performs. Romeo says yes, unaware that Charlie has long wanted her, and anyone who dares go near her is punished. However, Romeo braves the odds and dances with Laila to win her heart. As Laila starts falling in love with him, Charlie, in a fit of rage, captures and terrorizes Romeo. Romeo then promises that he would make Laila fall in love with Charlie. Romeo does not intend to lose Laila, but plans to deflate Charlie's ego by having a disguised Mini pretend to be Laila and make it clear she's not interested. This only ends up exacerbating Charlie's ire, forcing Romeo to promise him a second meeting with Laila.  The night of the appointment, however, Chhainu catches Romeo kissing Laila, who then shouts at Romeo telling Laila of Romeo's deal with Charlie and she angrily slaps him and says she never wants to see him again despite Romeo's pleas and forgiveness. In a pursuit, Charlie's Angels are wooed by Guru, Interval and Hero English, Chhainu is cornered by a mouse (and smashed with a "jumbo jet") and Charlie is chased and caught by the city dogcatchers. But just before Charlie is caught with a net, Romeo pushes him under the dog-catchers van to escape while Romeo goes, Charlie then convinces Guru, Hero English, Interval and Mini to create a distraction to get the guard away from the van, they all succeed and Charlie jumps on the van and says he will free Romeo using a pin in his chain to pick the lock, but the van begins to drive and he falls off, after which Charlie races after the van, losing the pin in the progress, but thankfully one of Charlie's ear hairs suffice.  They escape but Romeo feels there is no point staying as Laila said she never wanted to see him again, and Charlie badly wants her. The next morning, Romeo throws his sack onto an open train boxcar about to leave the station but Charlie arrives with Laila and the others. Charlie tells Romeo that he is a fool for leaving Laila when she still loves him, that he explained everything to her and says she is Romeo's and no one else's. He lets go of her hand and Laila begins to run after the train, while Romeo holds his hand out for her. Resembling a famous scene from ''[[Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge]]'', Charlie remarks "where have I seen this before?". She reaches for his hand and grabs it but the handle Romeo was holding had lost its top screws, making him fall off with Laila, after which they raise their heads to each other and say "I love you" in sync. It then goes to the "Moonlight Club" where everyone is back singing a reprise of "Main Hoon Romeo" in party-remix.

The band is signed to a recording contract by the same label as Vesuvius, and are sent on a midwest tour. However, Fish commits [[stereotype|stereotypical]] acts, despite the physical costs on his body, and he vandalizes a hotel room, which once again results in the band's arrest.  After bailing them out, Kim, Curtis' mother, promises the other parents she will stay for the remainder of the tour, so their children will not be influenced by Fish's antics.   The label asks A.D.D. to open a show for Vesuvius honoring their induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Fish refuses to play the gig and quits, with a repeat of the band getting a new drummer. Curtis eventually convinces him to put aside his resentment towards his former bandmates and play the show. Fish meets Vesuvius before the show to discover they have become vain and arrogant, and pretending to be British. Fish decides to move on from his past and wishes Vesuvius a great show. Fish and the band perform to a standing ovation. After their gig, Amelia and Curtis, and Fish and Kim both begin a relationship. Vesuvius takes the stage, and during their set the lead singer's microphone falls off the stand while the voice track of their song continues, then one line of the song starts incessantly sounding like a broken record, revealing that they have been [[lip-syncing]]. The audience condemns Vesuvius and chants an encore for A.D.D., performing for the crowd once again.  
RocknRolla
 In London, mob boss Lenny Cole ([[Tom Wilkinson]]) rules the ever-growing real estate business, using a corrupt Councillor ([[Jimi Mistry]]) for bureaucratic fixing, and his right-hand man Archy ([[Mark Strong]]) for the dirty side of things. A billionaire Russian businessman, Uri Omovich ([[Karel Roden]]), plans a fixed land deal, and London's crooks seem to all want a piece of it — particularly Uri's underhanded accountant Stella ([[Thandie Newton]]), and a gang called "The Wild Bunch" led by small-time crook "One-Two" ([[Gerard Butler]]), his partner "Mumbles" ([[Idris Elba]]), and their driver, "Handsome Bob" ([[Tom Hardy]]).  Uri agrees to Lenny's price of €7,000,000 to grease the Council's wheels, and as a sign of trust, loans him his "lucky painting." Yet when Uri arranges for Stella to move the funds, she double-crosses him and hires the Wild Bunch to steal the money. Unfortunately for Lenny, however, his junkie stepson Johnny Quid ([[Toby Kebbell]]), supposedly dead, steals the painting from Lenny's wall. Lenny and Archy then coerce Johnny's [[Talent manager|managers]] Mickey ([[Ludacris|Chris "Ludacris" Bridges]]) and Roman ([[Jeremy Piven]]) into tracking down Johnny. In a subplot, Handsome Bob gets close to Stella's gay husband, a lawyer who has information on a longtime unknown informer in their criminal circle whose information has Bob looking at a five-year prison term.  Uri tasks Stella once more with covertly siphoning the necessary payoff from his holdings, despite his growing suspicion of her. Yet when his moneymen are once again robbed by the Wild Bunch, his assistant Victor convinces him that it's likely Lenny who is behind the robberies, and is also purposely keeping Uri's lucky painting from him. Uri & Victor then invite Lenny to a private golf game, where Victor beats him savagely with a golf club, finishing by breaking Lenny's leg as a warning to him.  Cookie ([[Matt King (comedian)|Matt King]]) happens to buy the painting from some crackheads who had just stolen it from Johnny's hideout. Cookie then gives the painting to One-Two who, in turn, offers the painting to Stella (after a sexual encounter) as a token of appreciation. After Stella leaves his flat, One-Two is surprised by Uri's henchmen but is rescued, and then kidnapped, by Archy and his goons who had come looking for Uri's money.  Uri wants to marry Stella, whom he has long admired. He goes to Stella's house to propose, but he then spots the painting. Stella lies and says she has had it for years. Uri, enraged by Stella's betrayal, orders Victor to kill her.  Archy brings Johnny, Roman, Mickey and the Wild Bunch to Lenny's warehouse where Lenny orders Johnny executed. He threatens to kill the Wild Bunch "very slowly" unless they give up the money they stole. Handsome Bob offers the legal documents concerning the informant in his pocket to Archy. Archy recognises the pseudonym used on documents, "Sidney Shaw", as belonging to Lenny. Lenny arranged with the police to routinely lock up many criminal associates (including Archy) for years at a time to enhance his own standing in the criminal underworld and to ensure his own freedom. Archy orders Lenny's men to free the Wild Bunch and has Lenny drowned and fed to crayfish.  In the lift, Johnny explains to Roman and Mickey that they will also be killed to leave no witnesses, and graphically explains the manner of their executions. His description unnerves the man who's to execute the three men, prompting him to act prematurely. Having also already anticipated this move, Johnny warns Mickey and Roman to intervene and kill their would-be executioner. Johnny shoots two more men waiting at the top of the lift and they escape the last of Archy's men (with help from the Wild Bunch).  Later, Archy picks up Johnny from [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] and gives Johnny Uri's lucky painting as a welcome home present. Archy says that obtaining the painting "cost a very wealthy Russian an arm and a leg" implying he had Uri killed. Johnny proclaims that, with his new-found freedom from addiction and his stepfather, he will do what he could not before: "become a real RocknRolla".  
Rock On!!
 ''Rock On!!'' begins in [[Mumbai]], with the [[rock music|rock]] [[rock band|band]] Magik, in 1998. Joseph (Joe) Mascarhenas ([[Arjun Rampal]]) is the lead guitarist who feels the necessity to prove his worth as a musician. Aditya Shroff ([[Farhan Akhtar]]) is the lead singer who rebelled against his well-to-do family to play music. Rob Nancy (Luke Kenny) who plays keyboards and Kedar Zaveri a.k.a. KD/"Killer Drummer" ([[Purab Kohli]]) comprise the remainder of the band. After a competition is announced by [[Channel V]], they decide to enter, as the winner will be offered an album contract and at least one music video.  After they win the competition, the band has to go through some sacrifices while signing the contract. Joe feels the most slighted when his song, which he wrote for his girlfriend, Debbie ([[Shahana Goswami]]), and which was the only slow track in the entire album, is excluded from the track list to make space for a random remix song. Debbie is also rejected as the band's stylist without even being called for any demonstration. Later, when the cameramen focus only on Aditya during the filming of the music video, Joe becomes furious at the director and Aditya before leaving with Debbie. Aditya, who failed to notice that anything was amiss, is shocked and abandons music and his girlfriend Tania ([[Nicolette Bird]]) leaving a note for her. "Magik" thus disbands and its members become estranged.  Ten years later, Aditya is a high-powered executive of an investment banking firm. His wife Sakshi ([[Prachi Desai]]), hoping to relieve his habitual resentment, decides to gift him a gold-chain wrist watch for his birthday. K.D., who now works for his father's jewellery business, overhears Sakshi talking about Aditya at the jewellery shop and introduces himself. Sakshi later conveys the meeting to Aditya who denies knowing K.D. When Sakshi finds a box filled with Magik's photos, she invites K.D. to the birthday party, telling him she wants to reunite Aditya with the band.  K.D. meets with Rob, who now makes a living composing [[jingle]]s for advertisements. Together, they invite Joe, who lives largely unemployed, with an eight-year-old son. The family is supported by Debbie, whom he has married and who holds a grudge against the band and also she working on a small-time fishing business. Joe feels he should reconcile with his old friend but Debbie sees this as his weakness. K.D. and Rob thus attend the party without Joe, and Aditya is shocked to see them. He later scolds Sakshi for trying to dig up his past, which he claims to have left behind. Sakshi is hurt, and she leaves him after informing him about her pregnancy. Sakshi's friend Devika ([[Koel Purie]]) persuades Aditya to face his past and meet with his ex-bandmates. K.D., Joe, and Rob meet up and visit the place where they used to practice as a band. Aditya also turns up and reconciles with Joe and the rest. They start practicing regularly at Aditya's house. Learning about this, Sakshi, too, returns to Aditya.  [[Channel V]] announces another contest, and at Rob's insistence, the band enters. Debbie arranges a guitar-playing job for Joe on a cruise-line, expected to set sail on the same day as the contest. It is later discovered that Rob is dying of a brain tumour and his last wish is to perform with Magik. The contest is aired on the radio, and while Joe is on his way to the airport, he hears Magik perform the song he wrote for Debbie 10 years ago, and dedicate it to him. This prompts him to join the competition, where he and Aditya sing a duet in another song. The epilogue reveals that Rob died two months after that performance. Sakshi gives birth to a baby boy, whom they name "Rob" in memory of their friend. Devika is dating K.D., who starts a record company with Joe. Debbie quits her job in the fishing business and becomes a successful stylist. The band members and their families meet every weekend to keep the band's "Magik" alive forever.

Meanwhile, Wheeler takes Ronnie to a party and leaves him unsupervised, resulting in Ronnie walking home alone and a series of angry messages from Ronnie's mother, Karen, on Wheeler's cell-phone. Ronnie and Augie's parents ask Sturdy Wings for new [[mentor]]s, and Danny and Wheeler are expelled from the program, thus failing to complete their community service. Beth says that she will defend Danny and Wheeler in court, but cannot make any promises, as they will eventually be sent to jail. Danny and Wheeler argue and go their separate ways.  Danny convinces King Argotron to allow himself and Augie to fight that afternoon in the much-awaited battle royale. Wheeler gets permission from Karen to hang out with Ronnie after he gets out of jail, and earns Ronnie's forgiveness. However, the King secretly warns the other members of Augie's LAIRE "country" of Xanthia that allowing Augie to fight with them will lead to severe retribution in the game. They call Augie to tell him he's too much of a liability and he has nowhere to turn. To form a new LAIRE country, Danny and Augie need four members and matching costumes. Danny asks Wheeler and Ronnie to join them. They arrive with Wheeler's Kiss costumes and a Kiss-themed Minotaur truck, naming their new country "Kiss-My-Anthia".

They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological dig]] at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a [[Mayan temple]], and are confronted by [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some [[vine]]s the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins.  At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a [[cell phone]] ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft.  The next morning, Stacy sees a tendril of vine has crept into a wound on her leg. The vines have also wrapped themselves around Mathias's lower legs and eaten them down to the bone. Eric and Jeff are barely able to remove the vines from Stacy but cannot get them off of Mathias. The cell phone is heard again from deep in the shaft so Stacy and Amy descend again. In a small, vine-covered room, the two find the body of the young archaeologist, Heinrich's friend, and a broken phone. They then realize that the ringing sound are made by the flowers of the vine. As Amy touches one flower, the vines attack and the two barely escape.  The group now realizes that the vines are predatory, which is why the Mayans won't let anyone leave. As Mathias' condition worsens, Jeff [[Amputation|amputates]] his legs to avoid an infection. Stacy becomes jealous at Eric comforting a distraught Amy. Later, she accuses them of [[having sex]] and claims that she overheard Amy moaning (the sound is implied to be made by the flowers). While the four argue, the vines suffocate Mathias by creeping down his throat.  In the morning Eric brings in Amy and Jeff into the tent and tells Stacy to show them what is on her back.  She turns around and exposed her back and the group can see vines underneath her skin . Eric pours alcohol over her leg to sterilize it and then cuts it to remove the vine. He then proceeds to remove the three-foot-long vine from her spine. After they remove the vines she tries to take the knife, claiming that the vines are in her head. To calm Stacy down, Amy offers her some of the alcohol they used to sterilize her wounds. As Stacy proceeds to drink, the rest of the group watches her as a vine moves under the skin in her forehead, revealing that her accusations of them being there are true.  The next morning, Stacy awakens and leaves the tent, where the rest of the group is sleeping.  She finds a backpack, which contains a knife. Jeff heard moans coming from outside and goes to see what is going on. Then Jeff and Amy follow out with Eric. Jeff walks over to Stacy trying to calm her down as she has a deep gash on her forehead and is slicing up her thigh to get a vine out.  He touches her and she flails the knife at him, slicing his palm. He backs away. Eric approaches Stacy trying to calm her down also. As he touches her back to calm her, she spins around and fatally stabs him in the chest. While the rest try to calm Stacy down, Eric is dragged away by the vines. Overcome with remorse, Stacy begs Amy to kill her, and Jeff kills her out of an act of mercy.  Jeff makes a plan for Amy to escape. He smears Stacy's blood all over her, then carries her to the bottom of the temple and lays her on the ground. He then provokes and berates the Mayans, drawing their attention away from Amy. The Mayans eventually shoot Jeff with arrows. Amy gets up and runs through the jungle with the Mayans chasing after her. Jeff is killed by the Mayan leader with a gunshot to the head. After  escaping from the Mayans, she reaches the Jeep and manages to drive away, only to realize that there are vines growing inside her head.   After Amy's escape, Dimitri's two Greek friends are walking through the woods and come up to the temple, looking for him.  ===The Untold Ending===  * A  version of the scene plays out identically, then cuts to a [[cemetery]] where a [[Property caretaker|caretaker]] is walking among the headstones whistling "[[Frère Jacques]]". When he hears the same tune coming from Amy's grave, he goes forward to investigate and the camera follows, revealing several red flowers around the headstone. As the caretaker reaches for one, the music surges and the scene cuts to black.  Director Carter Smith told an interviewer, "We shot a bunch of different stuff to see which one would work best with the finished film. There's a testing process you go through with a studio movie and as frustrating as it can be, it also really gives you a good sense of how an audience feels about an ending. Our final decision was informed by what audiences found the most satisfying after watching a really punishing film. I love the ending of the book, but if the movie had ended the same way, the audience would have wanted to kill themselves."<ref name= "MH"></ref>

He soon forgets his grief and has a good time with Ajay, Ganesh, and Jagapathi.  One day, the four friends decide to go in Ajay's old ramshackle [[Samba (bus)|Volkswagen Samba]] to Hyderabad to watch a cricket match.  Vishwanath is a business tycoon in Hyderabad who has no time for his wife and teenage daughter Saroja. One day, Saroja is kidnapped, and the police enter the scene, with Vishwanath's friend ACP Ravichandran handling the case.  Meanwhile, a huge tanker lorry carrying highly inflammable and dangerous chemicals overturns on the National Highway between Chennai and Hyderabad and the four friends are stuck in a massive traffic jam. They attempt to take a shortcut to Hyderabad, but they end up in a dark, desolate area where their real troubles begin.  After arguing about which direction to take at a crossroad, Ajay convinces the others to drive into a forest, receiving instructions from [[Venkat Prabhu]] in a [[cameo appearance]]. As they proceed further, an injured man named R. Venkatraman suddenly falls on their car from above. Wanting to save Venkatraman, Jagapathi Babu asks Ganesh and Ram Babu to ask for help in a nearby building. Ajay, horrified by Venkatraman's bullet wounds, is even more shocked when he urges Jagapathi and Ajay to escape. Jagapathi, however, attempts to save Venkatraman, who repeatedly urges them to leave quickly.  A few men arrive in a jeep and shoot at them from a distance. Ajay rushes to the driver's seat and attempts to flee from the area. Their van gets hit by the other vehicle and is overturned, throwing Venkatraman outside. Ajay and Jagapathi remain inside the van. Sampath, the leader of the gang in the black jeep, steps out of his vehicle and shoots the dying man after a short conversation. Sampath then discovers that two men (Jagapathi and Ajay) had attempted to save the injured man; he orders his henchmen to kill them. Upon hearing Sampath's order, Ajay and Jagapathi run for their lives.  Meanwhile, Ganesh and Ram Babu have entered an abandoned factory in search of help. Finding the place empty, they walk out and wander around for some time. They soon reach the place where the van had overturned and realize that their friends are missing. At the same time, Ajay and Jagapathi are trapped inside a room within close range of one of the hitmen and escape narrowly. Ganesh and Ram continue to search the area for their friends and eventually find them after fighting with a few hitmen. Realizing that they are caught in a dangerous situation, all four run away from the factory toward the distant sound of a train. They barely manage to board the last car. Jagapathi does not board the train; he sees that his pocket has been torn, and he deduces that his wallet had fallen somewhere inside the factory. Ajay and Ram frantically attempt to convince Jagapathi to board the train. Jagapathi fears that the assassins might cause problems for his wife and child, since his wallet (containing his identity) might be in the hands of the gangsters. Thus, all four friends return to the factory to recover the lost wallet.  After a short argument in which the frightened Ajay hesitates to go along with Jagapathi to the factory, Ganesh is pushed to accompany him. Jagapathi and Ganesh enter the room where the wallet was dropped. One of the gangsters momentarily walks into the room, in the view of Ganesh. Ganesh hides and tries to warn Jagapathi to stay out of sight. When Jagapathi finds the wallet and turns around he realizes that Ganesh has disappeared. After searching the room thoroughly, Jagapathi decides to leave. When he walks out, Ajay and Ram are waiting alone, and there is no sign of Ganesh. This sparks off another argument; Ajay asserts that he would not leave the place without Ganesh. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Ganesh had wandered into another room to save himself. Finding Saroja tied up inside, he frees her and explains to her that he is not a member of the gang. In his usual manner, he falls in love and tries to impress her. Saroja and Ganesh then sneak out of the room. The other three set out to rescue Ganesh, but they get caught in the process.  Sampath continues to demand money from Vishwanath to release his daughter. ACP Ravichandran consoles Vishwanath and does all he can to help rescue Saroja. Meanwhile, the gangsters taunt the three men they have captured and continue to do so until Kalyani, Sampath's girlfriend, walks in and informs the group that Saroja has escaped. Sampath sends all of his men to find the girl, leaving a single gangster with the three captives. Ram attacks the gangster and kills him. They run out of the factory and catch up with Ganesh and Saroja. They are soon trapped in a building with a single entry. The henchmen follow them and await them in front. The friends are convinced that the only way to escape is to fight the gangsters. Suddenly, Jagapathi comes up with the idea of designing a contraption using objects in the building as weapons in a grand [[Rube Goldberg machine]]. In the meantime, Sampath asks Vishwanath to come to the area at once to take his daughter in exchange for the ransom money. Soon, Vishwanath and ACP Ravichandran arrive, and Ravichandran is disguised as Vishwanath's driver.  The four friends and Saroja finally arrive at the railway station to escape. They soon realize to their horror that the railway station is actually the exact spot where Sampath is planning to collect the ransom money from Vishwanath and Ravichandran. Vishwanath and Ravichandran are standing on the other side of the tracks. Saroja leaves the hideout, crosses the tracks, and embraces Ravichandran out of relief.  Just as Vishwanath is overjoyed that his daughter is back in safe hands, Ravichandran pulls out a gun and points it at Saroja. At that moment, Vishwanath realizes that Ravichandran is actually the mastermind behind Saroja's abduction and that Sampath is just another henchman responsible for carrying out Ravichandran's orders. A flashback reveals that Ravichandran and Sampath are good friends and that they have long been jealous of Vishwanath for his social status and wealth.  In the nick of time, the heroes emerge from the hideout and fight the goons with all their might. Vishwanath finally shoots and kills Ravichandran, and Saroja is reunited with her family. As everyone returns home, the four friends try to recall the name of the girl they have just rescued.

Even with Zeronos coming to the gang's aid, things seem bleak until a blue DenLiner appears with a new figure: Kamen Rider New Den-O.  After destroying the Shadow Imagin, with Yuuki and the Phantom Imagin retreating to the Ghost Train, the gang is brought onto the New DenLiner. There, Owner formally introduces the new Rider as Kotaro Nogami, Ryotaro's grandson from the future, and his Imagin Teddy. After Owner reveals he summoned Kotaro in response to a threat posed by the Ghost Train and its owner Shiro, who seeks to use the Ghost Train to reverse the worlds of the living and the dead. After Kotaro explains to Momotaros that he intends to pick up the slack for his grandfather, whom he has no respect for, he goes after the Ghost Train by himself as New Den-O to fight Yuuki after killing the Phantom Imagin until Shiro arrives and defeats New Den-O personally. Yuuki is about to kill Kotaro when Ryotaro attempts to regain control over his actions as the Taros arrive. Although Shiro and Yuuki escape, the New DenLiner crew get a Rider Ticket and a partial message from Ryotaro to Momotaros about protecting an "elephant" that leads them to where Shiro intends to carry out his plan: May 23, 1729.  There, the New DenLiner gang learn they have reinforcements in both Sieg and then Deneb, who join up with the gang in Yuto's stead as he is still injured from the fight with Yuuki.

During their dinner, Kotaro takes his leave as Momotaros follows him in an attempt to talk to him about how he strong is like his grandfather, but Kotaro has yet to see his grandfather in any way resembling someone "strong".  Later that night, Teddy discovers Shiro's plan to kill everyone in the village the next day, but is found out and attacked. He struggles back to their base of operations so his friends will know and says how the "elephant" is not really an elephant. Although New Den-O is without his partner and Yuto is still injured, Momotaros decides to get Ryotaro back even if it is the last thing he does. The next day, the other Tarōs and Deneb battle the mercenaries as Momotaros fights his way to Yuuki, attempting to call out of Ryotaro to fight his possessor before getting a mortal wound from Yuuki to his friends' horror. But at the last second, Ryotaro regains control as Momotaros enters his body and drives the Ghost Imagin out of him. Assuming Climax Form, Den-O easily takes out the Ghost Imagin as Shiro takes the Yuuki Belt and assumes Yuuki Hijack Form as he uses his necromancy to summon every Imagin the Riders have ever faced back from the dead.  After Climax Form is defeated, a fully healed Yuto and Kohana arrive via the ZeroLiner and New DenLiner, with Kohana giving the Tarōs and Sieg Den-O Belts with Rider Passes. The Imagin each assume their Den-O form as Ryotaro becomes Liner Form and Yuto becomes Zero Form.

Sora arrives, revealing to everyone else that she had been dead for 400 years and did not wish to be alive again, only to be with Shiro for eternity. Accepting his fate, Shiro and Sora board the Ghost Train to be together forever in the realm of the dead.  When the New DenLiner arrives in the middle of town to pick up the gang, Naomi questions being out in the open while the Owner reveals that the locals will only recognize it as an elephant. Ryotaro also reveals that he was aware of the "elephant" as it was the point in time where his ancestor Oyuki finds her true love. It is this point in history that Shiro planned to negate, preventing Ryotaro from ever existing and allowing him to bring Sora and everyone else who had died back to life. With his mission complete, Kotaro gains a new respect for his grandfather as he and Teddy are brought back to their time via the DenLiner, where they meet up with the elderly Ryotaro of their future.

Outside, Detective [[Mark Hoffman]] delivers Corbett Denlon to the police and claims they are the only survivors, but is shocked when Strahm is brought out alive as well.  During a press conference, Hoffman is promoted to detective lieutenant and credited with closing the case. He finds a note in his office that reads "I know who you are" and learns of Lindsey Perez's death while taking Strahm's phone. At the hospital, Strahm tells Hoffman that Perez's last words were his name, and questions how he escaped the plant. Strahm is also visited by his boss, Dan Erickson, who puts him on medical leave. Now suspicious of Hoffman and determined to piece together his involvement with Jigsaw, Strahm takes case files of past victims and begins researching them on his own.  In an underground room, five people awaken with collars connected to mounted blades locked around their necks, the keys to which are in individual glass boxes across the room. A videotape claims that all five of them are connected and implores them to "do the opposite" of their instincts throughout the game. They are also told to solve the puzzles and leave the rooms before the timer runs out or the jars of explosives in each corner of the rooms will explode. Mallick, an arsonist, activates the timer and everyone must reach for their key, but the wires are connected to the other participants and so they must go one at a time. Everyone manages to reach their keys except for Ashley, a former fire inspector, who is decapitated when the collars retract. The four proceed to the next room, where they learn that the overhead jars contain keys to three bomb shelters. Charles, an investigative journalist, strikes Mallick and begins smashing the jars one by one. Brit, a real estate vice president, and Luba, a city planner, each find a key and Charles takes Mallick's, only to be struck by Luba and left to die when the bombs detonate. In the third room, five short cables must be connected to a full bathtub to unlock the door. They deduce that someone will have to stay in the bathtub while the other two escape so Luba attacks Mallick to use his body to close the circuits, but Brit stabs her and they manage to open the door. In the fourth room, Mallick and Brit find a machine fitted with five circular saws and a beaker requiring ten pints of blood to open the door. Brit tries to use the keys from the first room to open the door but sees all the keys are the same, Mallick notes the five armholes and they realise that all five of them were meant to work together to survive the game. In the first room, they could have used the keys on each other to unlock the collars, in the second room the bomb shelters were big enough for more than one person and in the third room they all needed to hold the cables and put their hand in the water to open the door. Brit also works out their connection: they were all involved with a building fire that killed eight people. With no other options, they saw their arms to provide the blood.  Meanwhile, Strahm learns that Baxter killed Hoffman's sister, and was released from prison on a technicality. As revenge, Hoffman abducted and killed Baxter, using the pendulum trap to frame Jigsaw. It is revealed through flashbacks that he was later abducted by John Kramer, who blackmailed Hoffman into working with him. They set up most of the games together, with Hoffman planting Lawrence Gordon's penlight and providing the police files for the nerve gas house victims. Strahm realizes in the end that everyone was meant to die in the plant except for Corbett and Hoffman, who would appear to be a hero. His activities soon draw Erickson's worry, which is further fueled when Jill, who received a box and a videotape from Kramer's will, approaches Erickson and claims Strahm is stalking her. After Hoffman calls Erickson to tell him about Strahm's theory of a second accomplice, Erickson puts a tracker on Strahm's phone.  Erickson follows the tracker to the observation room and finds the phone and his own personnel file, which were planted by Hoffman. He also finds Brit, who managed to crawl from the fourth room after Mallick passed out from blood loss. Erickson calls for medical attention for the victims, and puts out an [[all-points bulletin]] on Strahm, who follows Hoffman to the renovated nerve gas house, and finds an underground room containing a clear box filled with ice cubes. Hoffman's tape urges Strahm to enter the box, but he stops it short and ambushes Hoffman. After a brief struggle he seals Hoffman in the box, which seals the room's exit. Hoffman indicates the tape, which warns Strahm that if he does not enter the box he will die while Hoffman will inherit Jigsaw's legacy. The box is safely lowered into the floor as the walls close in on Strahm, who unsuccessfully attempts to escape through the ceiling grid, and is crushed to death.

Lily appears to pick it up. Then, a gunshot is heard and Lily sees that she had accidentally killed her mother.  In the night, Lily sees many bees in her room and tells her father but T-Ray yells at her to go back to bed. The next night, Lily runs into their peach orchard, and digs up a box containing several of her mother's possessions. Lily lies down, staring at the stars and talking to her mother's spirit, but she hears her father calling. He accosts her, and takes her home and punishes her.  The next morning, the housekeeper Rosaleen Daise, surprises Lily with a cake for her 14th birthday. As T-Ray enters, Rosaleen states that she is going to take Lily into town. Lily asks him to tell her about her mother as her birthday gift but he doesn't. When Rosaleen and Lily leave, they are confronted by three racist men who insult Rosaleen. She spits on them, gets beaten up, and is taken off to a hospital. After T-Ray and Lily get home, T-Ray punishes Lily by sending her to her bedroom, and he and Lily argue. After he exits, Lily packs up, leaves a note, and leaves the house to save Rosaleen from the hospital she was put in.  After saving her, they run away to a town, Tiburon, that was written on one of her mother's items Lily had. They find a honey jar with the same picture as that item. When they ask who made the honey, they are led to the house of August Boatwright, and her sisters, May and June. May has a condition that causes emotional breakdowns any time something bad happens to someone. Lily lies and says that she is an orphan, that Rosaleen is a nanny, and that they have no place to stay. August offers to let them help with the honey in exchange for shelter.  Lily grows up in their household, and asks August why she uses "black" Mary pictures. She claims that she was sent by God to help [[African American]]s have peace and equality. She discovers a wall outside of the house that has little pieces of paper stuffed between the holes. It was built for May, to help her deal with her emotions. She would write down all the things that troubled her and put them into the wall.  Lily becomes friends with Zach Taylor, a teenage beekeeper at August's. Soon after, Lily rides to town with Zach to deliver honey, she confides in him the truth of their situation and the reason why she came to August. He gives her a notebook because she said she wanted to become a writer. They decide to watch a movie together but Lily sits in the "colored" section. A racist mob kidnaps Zach, and they call Lily names for choosing to associate with him. Zach's mother, and the Boatwright family, are very worried and concerned. June and August decide not to tell May of Zach's disappearance, for fear of what it would do to her fragile mental state.  Zach's mother comes to the house to pray before the statue of the Black Madonna in the living room, and runs into May afterwards. She confides in an unknowing May, who subsequently goes into shock. The others grow worried after May goes to the wall for an unusual amount of time. They go out to look for her only to discover that May killed herself, by placing a large rock upon her chest, and lying down in a shallow section of a river. She writes a suicide note to August and June, claiming that she was too tired of carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders, and that she would be much happier with her sister and parents in Heaven. Soon after May's death, Zach returns. After May's funeral, August and June slowly begin to recover from their loss. June finally agrees to marry her boyfriend, Neil, whom she had broken up with in a fit of anger. Realizing the sisterly bond they have formed with Rosaleen, August and June embrace her as their new sister, and decide to call her "July".  Meanwhile, Lily shows August the picture of her mother, and August admits that she knew all along. Lily confesses that while she was trying to help her mother, she wound up killing her. She also confesses her belief that Zach's disappearance was all her fault, as well, so she needs to leave. Convinced that it is best for everyone, she leaves since she is unlovable and destroys all that she comes across. Lily breaks down crying and runs to the honey house, where she breaks several jars. August finds her, and gives her the things that Deborah left when she went back to get Lily. Lily doesn't believe her, so August gives her more emotional items of Deborah's.  Later on, T-Ray comes to the Boatwright home looking for Lily. When he sees Lily wearing her mother's pin, he mistakes her for her mother for a second, and proceeds to grab her, draging her out of the house, all the while telling her she can't leave him. In a moment of panic, Lily calls him 'Daddy', causing him to come to his senses. She tells him she's staying there, and after August shows up to calm the scene, and assure him they'll take care of her, he reluctantly gives August permission to take care of Lily, for as long as she wanted to stay there. As T-Ray drives off, he admits that the day Deborah left, she wasn't only coming back for her stuff, but coming back for Lily. He says he lied because she wasn't coming back for him.  Lily's voice-over states that she thought, as T-Ray drove off, saying "Good riddance", he was really saying "Lily, you'll be better off here with all of these mothers." Lily is shown writing the contents of the entire story into the notebook that Zach gave her, and she puts it in May's wall and is wearing Zach's necklace. She walks off into the honey house.  
La seconda volta non si scorda mai
   
Semi-Pro
 In 1976, Jackie Moon is a singer who used the profits from his [[one-hit wonder]], "Love Me Sexy," to buy a basketball team in the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA), the [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] Tropics, becoming the owner, head coach, and starting [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]]. The ABA Commissioner announces a plan to [[ABA-NBA merger|merge the league]] with the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), but only four teams will move to the more established league. The Tropics, the worst team in the league, are in danger of dissolving. Jackie argues that the teams with the four best records should be merged and the Commissioner accepts.  Jackie trades the team's washing machine to the [[Kentucky Colonels]] for Ed Monix, a backup [[point guard]] who won an NBA Championship with the [[Boston Celtics]], but did not play during the playoffs. The Commissioner reveals that the Tropics will also need at least 2,000 fans at every remaining home game. Jackie begins to stage extremely desperate stunts, like wrestling a bear named Dewie. The Tropics begin playing better with Monix, as well as the increased intensity of Clarence Withers, the Tropics' best player. Monix takes over as offensive and defensive coordinator and starting point guard, leaving Jackie as the head coach. Monix trains the team rigorously with a play he calls the "Puke" as the players are to run it, until they literally throw up.  From Monix's training, the Tropics go on a winning run, moving from last to fifth. Jackie gets a visit from the Commissioner. The NBA does not think that Flint has a large enough media market and will not allow the Tropics into the league even if they beat the first place [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the last game of the season. Jackie admits that he stole "Love Me Sexy" from a napkin his mother wrote on three weeks before she died. Realizing that all his assets are basically stolen, Jackie trades Withers to the Spurs so that he may realize his dream of playing in the NBA. Monix inspires the team to leave everything on the court, while they may not be able to continue the franchise after this season, they have come very far and still have a lot to prove.  Going into the Spurs game, which Moon declares the "MegaBowl", the Tropics are in fifth place and with a win they would make it into fourth, although they have no chance in making it into the NBA. The game begins and the Tropics fall behind quickly. In the closing seconds of the first half, Jackie gets fouled hard by Petrelli while going up for a shot and is injured. Withers decides he has seen enough and rushes into the Tropics locker rooms with the rest of the team, which angers the Spurs.  During halftime, an unconscious Jackie imagines that he is in heaven with his mother. He apologizes for stealing her song and she gives him a weapon in order to win. On the court, the Tropics reveal their new weapon: the [[Alley-oop (basketball)|alley-oop]]. With the return of Withers, the alley-oop is very effective, but the referee calls the play a foul. After some persuasion by Jackie and Monix, is soon convinced that it is a legitimate score. The Tropics take advantage of this new strategy and begin coming back. After the Spurs start defending against the Alley-Oop, Monix calls a time-out and calls for them to run the "Puke" with 12 seconds left and down by two points, 117–115. The play gives Jackie the ball, but he gets fouled hard again with two seconds left, giving him 2 [[free throws]]. Shooting granny style, Moon sinks the first basket. The second bounces off the rim but Monix tips it in right at the [[buzzer beater|buzzer]] for two points to win, sparking a wild celebration in the arena and the streets of Flint.  The Spurs' coach offers Withers his position back. The now-former ABA Commissioner offers Jackie a position on the staff of the NBA Assistant Commissioner, as a marketing director. As Jackie is about to accept, the Commissioner is mauled by Dewie the bear and the celebration quickly turns into an arena-wide panic.

Secrets of the Furious Five
 ===Introduction=== [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Po]] ([[Jack Black]]) is assigned by Master [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Shifu|Shifu]] ([[Dustin Hoffman]]) to teach an introduction to [[Chinese martial arts|Kung Fu]] class for a group of rambunctious bunny children. Po tries to explain to the kids that combat is not the only part of what [[Kung fu (term)|Kung Fu]] is about, while its true meaning is "excellence of self." To illustrate his point, he uses the stories of the [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#The Furious Five|Furious Five]]'s individual pasts and the basic philosophical concepts they learned that enabled them to be great Kung Fu masters.  ===[[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Mantis|Mantis]]=== In his youth, '''Mantis''' was a petulantly impatient warrior who was prone to jumping to conclusions and making impulsive decisions. When this habit got himself captured by crocodile bandits, the long wait he was forced to endure in his cage allowed him to find the ''patience'' to play dead long enough to ambush his captors.  ===[[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Viper|Viper]]=== '''Viper''', the daughter of [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Great Master Viper|Great Master Viper]], was born without venomous fangs. Her father, who relied on his venomous bite to protect the village, was despondent that she could never succeed him as a warrior, making her feel timid. One night during a festival, Great Master Viper encountered a gorilla bandit who wore armor hard enough to shatter his fangs when he tried to bite him. Seeing her father in peril, Viper found the ''courage'' to fight the bandit and defeat him with her [[Ribbon (rhythmic gymnastics)|ribbon dancing]] skills.  ===[[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Crane|Crane]]=== '''Crane''' was an unconfident janitor of a Kung Fu academy until the star pupil [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Mei Ling|Mei Ling]] encouraged him to seek enrollment in the school. Even though his nerve failed him at the tryouts, Crane accidentally stumbled into the intimidating challenge that determined eligibility and suddenly found the ''confidence'' to take the challenge, with his skinny body proving to be an asset that enabled him to succeed.  ===[[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Tigress|Tigress]]=== '''Tigress''' was an orphan whose status as an [[apex predator]] and her destructive lack of control of her strength left her feared and isolated in the rest of the orphanage where she lived. Master [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Shifu|Shifu]] came to kindly teach her the ''discipline'' she desperately needed to control her movements until she could perform delicate tasks with ease enough to allay the concerns of the orphanage and the kids that lived there. When she was again rejected for adoption by the adults who were still scared of her, Master Shifu took her in as his student and foster daughter.  ===[[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Monkey|Monkey]]=== '''Monkey''' was a troublemaker who tormented his village owing to him being publicly humiliated in his youth. He defied all attempts to force him to leave by removing his assailants' belts that held their pants up until Master [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Grand Master Oogway|Oogway]] confronted him and defeated him in a fight (since he wore no pants), deducing the cause of his anti-social behavior. Rather than making him leave the village as per the challenge, Oogway told him to stay and encouraged him to show ''compassion'' to others, as he would want in similar circumstances.  ===Conclusion=== At the end, Master [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Shifu|Shifu]] returns to see [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Po]]'s anticipated lack of progress teaching and he's surprised that he underestimated Po's talents yet again, considering how much Po's students have learned. But when the bunnies ask Po how ''his'' first day of Kung Fu was, all the unpleasant memories during the [[Kung Fu Panda|original film]] flash through his head; he then proudly says, "It was totally awesome!"

Despite this, Stewart pleads for a 6 month extension so that he can pay with his bonus in January, whereas Ben leaves with the matter unresolved. On his way out Ben talks to Inez, an elderly resident whom Stewart was attempting to talk to earlier but was unsuccessful in doing so.  Ben informs Inez that he has the capacity to drastically change Stewart's circumstances for the better, but needs to be sure that he deserves it and that if he is a "good man". Inez tearfully confides with Ben that Stewart has barred the nurses from bathing her, after her request to be put on different medication is refused as the original makes her dizzy. Visibly appalled by this revelation, Ben transports Inez from her room to the bathrooms whilst Stewart attempts to perform damage control. Ben angrily demands Stewart show his patients better respect, and ultimately denies his request there and then for an extension.  '''Connie Tepos'''  Ben later meets with Holly ([[Judyann Elder]]), a child services employee to ask her the name of someone who is in dire need of help, but is too proud to ask. Holly directs Ben's attention to Connie Tepos, a [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latin immigrant]] whose boyfriend beats her regularly, and almost killed her in the previous year. Connie is too scared of repercussions to press charges, leaving Holly powerless to help. Ben travels to Connie's home still posing as an IRS agent, but upon revealing that he knows of her genuine situation Connie demands he leaves. Ben leaves his calling card just in case she changes her mind.  Several days later, a scared and desperate Connie calls Ben to accept his help. Ben arrives momentarily and realizes that her boyfriend has beaten her again. Ben gifts her the deed to his beach house, to provide her and her children a safe home.  '''George and Nicholas'''  George ([[Bill Smitrovich]]), is the coach of a junior hockey team who had also arranged partial scholarships for some of his players to attend College. George also has [[kidney failure]], prompting Ben to donate his own kidney as a reward for George's good nature. Nicholas (Quintin Kelly) is a younger patient at the same hospital George is at. By chance, Ben decides to donate his bone marrow to Nicholas to help with his treatment.    Ben meets with Emily several times over at her home, he establishes a bond with her Great Dane 'Duke'. Ben asks Emily why she would choose such a large animal, to which Emily responds that the average life span of a Great Dane is seven years, and that they commonly have from heart problems. Emily considers that she chose to take care of something else as opposed to always being taken care of. During the pair's final meeting where Emily cooks Ben dinner, the two finally share a passionate kiss after having long established feelings for each other.  During the evening, the "real" Ben Thomas ([[Michael Ealy]]) shows up outside, and demands that "Tim", his brother who was impersonating as "Ben" return his IRS credentials. Tim attempts to leave, but ends up spending the night with Emily. The two play a game of "What If?" With Emily wondering if whether her pager will go off - signalling that a donor has been found for her. Tim wonders if they would both eventually get married and have children together. Emily eventually falls asleep. Tim leaves and heads to the hospital where Emily is being treated at to ask her doctor the chances of finding a suitable donor. When the doctor reveals these chances to be almost impossible, Tim decides to call Dan Morris ([[Barry Pepper]]), his life long best friend to announce that "it's time".  Returning to his Motel room, Tim makes two final phone calls. The first goes to Ezra, the blind vegetarian that Tim verbally abused over the phone. Tim profusely apologizes for his actions, but pleads with Ezra that he had to ensure he was a decent person by attempting to get the better of him. Tim then calls 9-1-1 as introduced in the film, before filling a bathtub with ice water. As he is entering the bathtub, Tim reminisces about the night that changed him forever. Driving a [[Chevrolet Corvette]] with his wife as passenger, Tim carelessly texts whilst driving, and very nearly collides with an oncoming car. Swerving violently, Tim collides with a [[Ford E-Series]] van, causing both cars to roll violently and kill the six occupants of the van as well as Tim's wife. Back in the present, Tim tips a bucket into the water containing a [[Box Jellyfish]], its tentacles wrap around Tim's arm and delivers a sting which causes a quick but excruciatingly painful death.  Having committed suicide in ice water, Tim has cautiously preserved his vital organs - his heart in particular which is donated to Emily. The real Ben meets with Emily, and tells her that a year following the accident he got [[lung cancer]], and required a double-lobe transplant which Tim came to his aid for. Six months later, Tim then gave part of his liver to Holly, the child services employee seen earlier in the film. Emily attends a Church session where Ezra is playing piano to a children's choir. As the performance ends, it is shown that Ezra is now able to see as he congratulates the choir on their singing. Emily makes contact with Ezra, but is so overwhelmed by seeing Ben's eyes in Ezra that she begins to break down into tears. Ezra, seeing her scar from heart surgery, realizes she is Emily, and the two share an emotional hug.  
Seval
  The beginning is promising, at any rate, as you watch a Don't-Care Murugesan ([[Bharath (actor)|Bharath]]) limp sorrowfully from the Central Jail, Palayamkottai, in a scruffy beard and glasses.  He has been incarcerated for 17 years. Naturally, there's a story which rewinds from 1989. In those halcyon days, he's an unruly youngster in pretty village Sivasailam, (Hari's forte, Thirunelveli District), the son of a hard-working flower-sellers ([[Rajesh (actor)|Rajesh]] and Yuvasri), with Thapaal Thangavelu ([[Vadivelu]]), who provides as much laughter as the posts he delivers.  Life is a long, sunny adventure for Murugesan who beats people up, sells his grandfather's land, runs over rooftops (like the rooster of the title) and incurs so much of his father's wrath that he's prophesied to meet a horrible end. Not that this gloomy prospect affects Murugesan—he continues on his own sweet way until he runs smack into Parijatham (debutante [[Poonam Bajwa]]), a demure, fair-complexioned, striking Iyer girl, the daughter of Panjami Iyer ([[Y. G. Mahendran]]) and the younger sister of Gayathri ([[Simran (actress)|Simran]]).  Thus we have the first half which is a series of rollicking fun interspersed with logical sequences; the two have sudden and quirky escapades.  In the meantime, the village's bigwig Periyavar ([[Sampath Raj]]), who is magnanimous in public and a tyrant at home, casts his eyes on Parijatham. What sets his characterization apart is that he is not your average villain who shrieks and carries away the heroine; he places his pawns carefully, and is afraid of being found out and Parijatham is trapped and  he starts removing her dresses. He and Murugesan come close to breaking each other's bones many times—but the situations defuse themselves in a perfectly natural fashion.  Several twists in the tale occur in a quick fashion, and Murugesan and Parijatham are bound in a net from which, seemingly, there is no escape.  
The Seven of Daran: Battle of Pareo Rock
 11-year-old boy Jimmy Westwood ([[Johann Harmse]]) lives in South-Africa with his mother. The young girl Charita ([[Ketrice Maitisa]]) from the Saladir tribe lives alone in the city and works on the street cleaning car windows. One day she cleans the windows of the car of Jimmy and his mother, without asking; she does not get paid. Later she takes revenge by stealing Jimmy's wallet. Jimmy goes after her and asks the wallet back. This happens at a market where a small white [[giraffe]] is sold through an auction. It can talk and tells Jimmy that he has to prevent an upcoming war between two tribes, the Bombattas and the Saladir. It gives Jimmy a magical [[pendant]]. Jimmy frees the giraffe. With Charita he runs away, chased by the owner who sold the giraffe but had not delivered it yet to the buyer. They are arrested and locked up by the police. Charita returns the wallet to Jimmy, withholding money for cleaning the car windows. They are friends now. Jimmy is released when his mother comes to collect him. The mother of their maid knows about the giraffe, and explains to Jimmy that it is one of the "seven of Daran", magical animals which each watch over one continent. This convinces Jimmy that he has to do what the giraffe instructed him to do. He leaves a note for his mother that he is going on a mission, and frees Charita from the police cell. Together they go to the war zone to be, to prevent the war, as Jimmy was told to do by the giraffe.  A [[child soldier]] from the Bombatta tribe shoots Jimmy in his leg, but despite that and the fact that the child soldier and the girl are from the opposing tribes, the three become friends. They are caught by the owner of the giraffe, and taken by car to help finding the giraffe, or similar ones. Jimmy's mother, who found out where Jimmy was going, comes by helicopter to search for him. She sees Jimmy in the car, after which the pilot attacks the car, and the three children are freed. Jimmy learns from his mother that she has caused the hostility between the tribes because she wants to make a [[golf course]], which one tribe wants to earn money, but the other opposes because it is on [[Sacred#Sacred ground|ground that is sacred for them]].  Jimmy's mother does not allow Jimmy to go and try to prevent the war, but he sneaks with the other two children into the helicopter, and Jimmy flies away; he has learned flying from a [[flight simulator]] game on his computer. They arrive in the war zone, where later the mother also arrives. Jimmy is hit by a bullet, but saved by the fact that the bullet hits the pendant. His mother agrees to abandon the plan for the golf course, and the tribes reconcile.  
Séraphine (film)
 The film follows the life of a middle-aged housekeeper, [[Séraphine Louis]], who has a remarkable talent for painting. Untaught and following what she regards as religious inspiration she finds great appreciation in the beauty found in nature, especially her daily walks to work where she proudly and humbly stops to gaze at trees. In the beginning, it is noted that she stops to collect soil from  plants as well as some blood from a dead pig. Later, in her small home lit by candles she is seen using these same ingredients while creating her art. At one point when her art begins to be seen, she is asked how she achieves the unusual effect in her "rouge" (reds). She replies that she prefers to keep that a secret.  Uhde, a noted art critic, encounters her first as a housekeeper and then sees one of her paintings, which he regards as very promising. Séraphine feels she is just a housekeeper and no one will take her seriously, but Uhde firmly assures her she has a talent and that he will look after her and promote her work. He kindly tells her to follow her gift, but he is a German and has to flee France and leave Séraphine when the 1914 war begins. However, she continues to do her paintings. In 1927, Uhde encounters Séraphine again and considers her work to have greatly improved. He begins buying her pictures and encouraging her to do nothing but paint. But prosperity upsets the woman's balance, she buys an expensive bridal gown even though she has no suitor, and claims to have received an important message from the angels. As the Great Depression gets under way, Uhde can no longer sell her paintings and is forced to disappoint Séraphine, who has begun to regard herself as a woman of means. She is mentally affected by the setback.  After she rouses the town while wearing her bridal gown, she is put into a lunatic asylum and eventually stops painting. Uhde visits but is advised not to make contact since this would deeply upset her, even to be told that he has finally sold some of her artworks. He decides to care for her well-being and secures her a room in the institution which enables her to go outside, where she begins to enjoy the beauties of nature again. It is revealed that she died in 1942 and that her art became famous and respected.

In desperation, Tachi planned to join the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebels in Mexico. Unfortunately, Tachi was fired from his job, which made him more upset. This prompted him to find a sorcerer to spell a curse to his employer. While looking for a sorcerer at Sonora Market in Mexico City Tachi met Ehe. The medicine man cautioned him about the dangers of sorcery and he informed the young Mexican about the spiritual tradition of the Aztecs known as [[Tetzkatlipoka]].

Seventh Moon
 Melissa and her Chinese-American husband Yul are spending their honeymoon in China. They participate in the "[[Hungry Ghost]]" Festival, a sort of local Halloween, when the dead roam among the living.  Their affable guide Ping drives them to the village where Yul's relatives live. At night while Yul is asleep, Ping stops the car and tells Melissa he must ask directions. Ping does not return, so Melissa and Yul search for him. The windows in the village are boarded up and live animals are left as offerings along the empty streets. The locals start chanting something unintelligible from behind the doors.  The couple returns to the car and decide to drive away without Ping, trying to find the way back to the city. They meet a wounded stranger on the road. Helping him, they are attacked and chased by pale creatures. They seek shelter in a barn, where the stranger tries to knock Yul out in order to feed him to the creatures in his place. Melissa manages to subdue the man and drag a wounded Yul back to the car. The stranger is slaughtered while Melissa and Yul barricade themselves inside the car.  The creatures smash the car to reach the couple, who escapes through the trunk, reaching safety inside a crypt. They hear the villagers chanting again, the chant led by the same male voice they had heard on the radio while first trying to drive away. They are compelled to leave their hiding place and enter a house adorned with lit candles, where a large number of people are gathered. In their trance, they hear reassuring words in their mind. They let the villagers strip them down and start having sex on the floor in front of them, then black out.  Melissa and Yul wake up in a field, tied up to a tree back to back. The creatures are now all around them. Yul, realizing that they are the chosen sacrifices, start telling the demons to take him and spare his wife. The creatures comply, and Melissa wakes up inside the house, while Ping shows up again and explains to her that they have been forced to lure outsiders in as sacrifices, in order to stop the moon demons from taking one of the villagers. Ping says Yul did a very brave thing by letting himself be taken to save his wife. After an enraged Melissa assaults him and starts to savagely beat him for his betrayal, Ping reveals that Yul is still alive, as the moon demons need a live human to be turned into one of them.  Despite Ping's warnings, Melissa goes after her husband, following a trail of candles to the subterranean cave where she finds the moon demons standing still waiting for Yul to bleed out. Yul has begun to transform though the process is incomplete, and he is too weak from his injuries to move. He tells Melissa the creatures are already inside his head, and she has to leave or she will be killed. They exchange a final vow of love, Melissa promising to visit Yul's relatives. She puts back on the wedding ring the villagers had taken away from Yul, then leaves the cave sobbing. Soon the moon demons begin to chase her again, but are slowed down by Ping, who sacrifices himself out of guilt to allow Melissa's escape.  Once out in the open, the creatures keep pursuing Melissa, and are nearly on top of her when the moon begins to set, turning the demons into silvery dust. As the sun rises Melissa sees Yul, fully transformed. He turns to dust.

At one time a prestige establishment, the theater now runs porn double bills and serves as a meeting ground for hustlers of every conceivable persuasion. The film captures the sordid, fetid atmosphere, interweaving various family subplots with the comings and goings of customers, thieves and even a runaway goat while enveloping the viewer in a maelstrom of sound, noise and continuous motion.

Sex Drive (film)
 Ian Lafferty ([[Josh Zuckerman (actor)|Josh Zuckerman]]) is an 18-year-old recent high school graduate. He searches for a girl online making it seem as if he is attractive and strong, although he is sweet and unassuming. He soon meets "Ms. Tasty" ([[Katrina Bowden]]) and agrees to meet her in person. She lives in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], while he lives in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. With his best friends Lance Nesbitt ([[Clark Duke]]) and Felicia Alpine ([[Amanda Crew]]), he goes to Knoxville in a [[Pontiac GTO|1969 Pontiac GTO Judge]] borrowed without permission from Ian's arrogant homophobic older brother Rex ([[James Marsden]]).  On the way to Knoxville, they come across a hitchhiker ([[David Koechner]]), as the radiator in the Judge overheats. Felicia suggests urinating in the radiator in order to get to the next town, so they talk her into urinating into the radiator after her friends when the hitchhiker says he is empty. They only works briefly as they try to leave the hitchhiker in the dust. The hitchhiker, frustrated at Ian's lack of concern for his well being, leaves, but not before urinating on the car window. As Ian and Felicia wander to find help, Lance is waiting with the car as Ezekiel ([[Seth Green]]) happens to pass by in his horse-drawn buggy. Ezekiel and his [[Amish]] buddies repair the car while they join a [[Rumspringa]] party where [[Fall Out Boy]] are playing a concert, and at which Lance meets an attractive Amish girl, Mary ([[Alice Greczyn]]). The three promise to come again on the way back to do some work in return for fixing the car.  They go to jail due to Ian throwing a tire iron into a state trooper car, due to his increasing frustration after trying to put a possum he hit out of its misery, and are released after Mary pays the bail. Upon arriving in Knoxville, they find a hotel that sports a wide variety of role playing rooms. Rex, who has discovered the Judge missing, arrives angrily and insists that they go back and that Ian cannot visit Ms. Tasty. After Ian pretends to be gay, Rex allows him to see Ms. Tasty, hoping this encounter will change Ian's mind. Ian finally meets Ms. Tasty. However, when he tells her about Felicia, her seduction of Ian becomes a threat as her psychotic boyfriend Bobby Jo ([[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]]) puts a gun to Ian's head. It becomes apparent that they work at a chop shop and attempt to steal the Judge.  Lance and Mary arrive after having sex, as well as a redneck named Rick ([[Michael Cudlitz]]) whose girlfriend Brandy ([[Andrea Anders]]) slept with Lance earlier. Felicia, however, is hiding in the car when Bobby Jo tries to steal it. Soon, a green car that has been continuously drag-racing with the Judge throughout the movie arrives. Ian manages to save Felicia, who then is able to run off and report to the police. Ms. Tasty tries to escape, but is stopped by the green car, whose drivers turn out to be Andy and Randy ([[Charlie McDermott]] and [[Mark L. Young]]), two dim-witted self-declared "womanizers" from Ian's school, whom Ms. Tasty tried to manipulate into giving her the car. Bobby Jo is treated after being shot by Ian in self-defense. Felicia tells the police about the chop shop location and the couple is arrested.  Upon finding out that if Mary leaves the Amish community, she will be shunned, Lance refuses to come back home and stays behind to marry Mary, while Ian and Felicia realize their love for each other. Ian and Felicia drive to a tree where Ian throws his shoes up into the tree. A few weeks later Ian is Felicia's date to her cousin's wedding. At Thanksgiving dinner, Rex tells his family that he is gay. On New Year's Eve Ian and Felicia finally have sex, in Ian's basement under a blanket on the sofa. In the final frame of the film, a picture is shown of Lance and Mary getting married, accompanied by Ian. Lance is shown sporting a beard exactly like Ezekiel's. During the credits, a short scene shows Ezekiel and Fall Out Boy arguing over the fact that the Amish fixed Fall Out Boy's tour bus for just "a five song set" in form for compensation, referring to a running gag throughout the movie.  
Sex and the City (film)
   Carrie walks through the streets of [[New York City]] thinking about events that have happened to her and her friends during ''[[Sex and the City]]''. Charlotte is now happily married to Harry Goldenblatt, but she had a hard time getting pregnant - so they adopted a Chinese girl named Lily; Miranda has settled down in Brooklyn with [[Steve Brady|Steve]] ([[David Eigenberg]]) to raise their son Brady together; and Samantha has relocated her business to [[Los Angeles]] to be close to Smith ([[Jason Lewis (actor)|Jason Lewis]]), who is now a superstar, although she misses her old life and takes every opportunity to fly East to be with Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte.  Carrie herself is now in a relationship with [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Big]] ([[Chris Noth]]), and they are viewing apartments with plans to move in together. Carrie falls in love with a [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse]] far from their price range. Big immediately agrees to pay for it. Carrie offers to sell her own apartment, although she also voices her fear that she would have no legal rights to their home in case they separate, as they are not married. To quell her fears, Big suggests that they marry. Carrie announces the news to her friends. Charlotte and Miranda are happy at the news, but Samantha - as Carrie points out dryly - sounds more excited at the thought of Carrie "finally getting Botox". Charlotte suggests her longtime gay friend, Anthony Marantino, as the pushy [[wedding planner]].  Miranda confesses to her friends that she has been so busy she hasn’t had sex with Steve in six months. When Steve confesses he has cheated on her, Miranda is devastated and immediately separates from him. At Carrie and Big's rehearsal dinner, Steve tries to reconcile with Miranda, but she rebuffs him. Still upset with Steve, she tells Big bluntly that marriage ruins everything.  On the wedding day, (partially due to Miranda's words at the rehearsal dinner) Big is too fearful to go through with the ceremony. Carrie, devastated, flees the wedding. Samantha stays behind to clear the guests. Big changes his mind and catches up with Carrie in an attempt to reconcile in the middle of a one-way street. Carrie furiously attacks him with her bouquet while he earns scathing looks from Miranda and Charlotte, as well as from the crowds of New Yorkers watching the scene unfold. To console Carrie (who is depressed, and at the beginning of the holiday doesn't eat anything for two days), the four women take the honeymoon that Carrie had booked to [[Mexico]], where they de-stress and collect themselves.  Upon returning to New York, Carrie hires an assistant, Louise ([[Jennifer Hudson]]), to help her manage her life. Miranda eventually confesses to Carrie about what happened at the rehearsal dinner, and the two briefly fall out as Carrie storms out of a restaurant on Valentine's Day. After reflecting on the argument she had with Carrie, Miranda agrees to attend couples counseling with Steve, and they are eventually able to reconcile. Samantha finds her five-year-old relationship passionless, and begins over-eating to keep from cheating on Smith with a gorgeous neighbour, Dante. She eventually decides to say farewell to Smith and moves back to New York. Around the same time, Louise quits her job as Carrie's assistant to get married and move back permanently to her hometown of [[St Louis]].  Charlotte learns she is pregnant, and for most of her pregnancy is fearful that something might happen to her baby, so she stops her regular running around [[Central Park]]. Carrie puts her fear to rest by telling her that, since she already soiled herself in Mexico, her bad luck is finished. Later, Charlotte has a surprise encounter with Big that leaves her so outraged that her water breaks. Big takes her to the hospital and waits until baby Rose is born, hoping to see Carrie. Harry passes on the message that Big would like her to call him, and that he has written to her frequently, but never received a reply. Carrie searches her correspondence and finds in Louise's personal assistant file that he has sent her dozens of letters copied from the book she read him before their wedding, culminating with one of his own where he apologizes for screwing up and promises to love her forever.  Carrie travels to the exquisite penthouse Big had bought for them to collect a pair of brand new [[Manolo Blahnik]] shoes (that later become one of the icons of the movie) that she had left there. She finds Big in the walk-in closet he had built for her, and the moment she sees him, her anger at his betrayal dissipates. They share a passionate kiss, and Big proposes to Carrie properly, using one of her diamond-encrusted shoes in place of a ring. They later marry alone, in a simple wedding in New York City Hall, with Carrie wearing the simple suit that she had intended to wear before being enticed away by the [[Vivienne Westwood]] dress that she had modelled in the bridal issue of [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]. Miranda, Samantha, and Charlotte turn up to surprise Carrie, having been called by Big. The film ends with the four women sipping [[Cosmopolitan (cocktail)|cosmopolitans]], celebrating Samantha's fiftieth birthday, with Carrie making a [[Toast (honor)|toast]] to the next fifty.   
Shake, Rattle & Roll X
 ===Emergency=== The full moon looms high one windy night. Jay ([[JC De Vera]]) and Dennis (Janus Del Prado) were traveling along a dark highway. They accidentally ran over a pregnant woman ([[Mylene Dizon]]) crossing the street. They saw that she had a miscarriage, so they immediately carried her to the hospital.  The mysterious woman was not the only patient that night. There was a gay named Julius ([[John Lapus]]) who was complaining about fever, an English-speaking man named Eric (Eri Neeman) who keeps complaining about the hospital's defective apparatus and a "tortured" and badly injured man who immediately recognized the woman. He attempted to swipe her with his whip, but it only lead to his death.  Hospital radiologist Dr. Sarah ([[Roxanne Guinoo]]) examines the woman using an ultrasound. During the examination, a very eerie sound wailed through the air. They discovered that the infant died while inside the woman's womb. Meanwhile, Sarah went to the bathroom where it was revealed that she was "pregnant".  The woman then was transferred into an isolated room. The hospital's administrator, Dr. Ignacio (Perry Escano) became skeptical about the true nature of the woman. They speculated that she might not be human, so he decided to promote this idea, a thing that enraged Sarah.  Back into the isolated room, the woman had a dream of a man beating her with a magic whip: it was the same man who attempted her life as mentioned earlier. She gave a very shrill cry; a scream that gave evidence she was not human but an ''[[aswang]]'', a [[vampire]] or flesh eating witch in Filipino mythology. Together with her husband ([[Wendell Ramos]]), who was also a witch, along with their race, they seek vengeance on humanity, ready to invade the hospital. The hospital tenants brace themselves for the incoming attack. Dr. Ignacio is the first to be killed by the ''aswang''s husband after terminating Dennis.  Jay became aware of the events happening outside. He, Sarah and the others immediately evacuate to the upper floors as the witch relentlessly break in, killing patients including Julius and Erick. The others hid in the stock room while Jay rescues a young girl from the witch's wife.  Dennis, who had been separated from the team, discovered that dextrose can kill the witches but was proven wrong: [[holy water]] can. They formulated a plan: Jay and Sarah will ward the beasts off while hospital chaplain, Father Miguel (Cris Daluz) and Dennis, will bless the water tank with holy water.  Sarah and Jay were trapped in a locked corridor, with the beasts in pursuit. They use a defibrillator to electrocute the beasts. At that moment, Father Miguel and Dennis reached the tank, and Sarah jokingly revealed to Jay that she was pregnant.  At this point, the monsters turn into more powerful creatures and launch their final attack. Father Miguel, meanwhile, blesses the water in the tank, tainting it with holy water. While Jay is being attacked by the creatures, Sarah then uses a fire-lit boom to activate the [[fire sprinkler]]s/[[fire sprinkler system]] to destroy the ''aswang''s. At the end of the story, it is revealed that the babu was on the hospital's rooftop, thus avoiding getting soaked in holy water. It opens its eyes and uses the final scare of the episode.  ===Class Picture=== ====Plot==== A terrified young woman running through the halls of San Selino College at night sees horrific visions like a dead student wearing an old school uniform. When she finds herself clad in the same uniform, she becomes more terrified when she is scourged by an unseen force while a diabolical female laughter is heard. The young woman dies after being stoned and having her forehead sliced by a razor being held by an unknown female hand with a sleeve of a nun's habit.   Joy ([[Kim Chiu]]), Lui ([[Gerald Anderson]]) and their 8 friends are graduating college students of San Selino who spend their weekend in the campus, being assigned to prepare an exhibit in exchange for lifting their organization's suspension and their clearance for graduation. On their first night, one of their classmates, Nicole ([[Niña Jose]]), presumably the young woman in the opening, disappeared without a trace.  Waking up from a nightmare, Joy confesses to her friends of what happened the previous night; hours before midnight, she picked a mysterious class picture named "Rubi 1898" in the school's storage room. The picture shows an all-female class with a nun seated at the center. The second incident of this picture involves Blue ([[Eda Nolan]]) and Pinky ([[IC Mendoza]]) when they dumped some garbage. Blue took a look at the nun in the picture wherein the nun smiled. Suddenly, she was unknowingly captured by the same unknown force and she too, vanished. The spirit then killed Blue by apparently slicing her arms when she was stuck to a chair in a classroom.   Joy discovers sinister [[Chavacano]] writing in a classroom window, written in blood, stating ''"No me mires fijamente"''. When the group goes to the library, they try to translate the blood graffiti only to fail at first. Scanning the yearbooks for information, they find "Rubi" was a class section supervised by Sister Maria Belonia ([[Jean Garcia]]). They also discover a similar class picture of the same section with a male teacher standing at the middle in place of Belonia, revealed as Virgilio, who became the substitute adviser during Belonia's absence. In the same yearbook, Joy discovers three students, namely Crisel, Sabel, and Adela, who were the missing students of the "Rubi" section.  The group finally discovers from the computer translator that the Chavacano words mean '''"Do not Stare"'''. Little that the group knows that the "Rubi" picture Joy picked up is a possessed photograph and that the bloody writing was a warning saying that anyone who looks at the nun at the cursed picture will disappear and die.   The dark answer is revealed at this point; Belonia must seek three students from them. Lui looks at the picture and spots their group mates in the photo; Nicole and Blue. Also at this point, Nicole is revealed to be the young woman in the opening scene. Joy reveals that she is the next to be taken for accidentally looking at the nun before she is abducted by the same unknown force, now revealed to be Sis. Maria Belonia herself, an evil [[nun]] teacher who haunts the school in return for a terrible oath done in the past; her responsibility of the death of the institution's students in the Spanish Colonial Period.  Joy runs through the school's hallways in order to escape the wrath of Sis. Belonia. She sees the three missing students in a room being scourged by Belonia and once she has gone, Joy frees the trio. It is at this point revealing that Sister Belonia tortures students either for being disobedient or small mistakes. Crisel, Sabel, and Adela, in retaliation, wrote a letter to the [[Head teacher|headmistress nun]], Mother Agnes, for Belonia's actions. Mother Agnes, upon learning this, reprimands Sis. Belonia for her brutal and torturous manners of disciplining the three girls and her class. When the day for the class picture arrived, the headmistress realizes that their class have the said three girls missing. She then suspends Belonia from San Selino ''(this later explains why she utters the words often)'' and tells her that she cannot come back until the three students are found. In return, she committed suicide but not before swearing that she will complete her class' picture, ''(which explains her vengeance to take three students)''. Later on, she finds herself now clad in an old school uniform.  Lui and Greg ([[Prince Stefan (actor)|Prince Stefan]]) chased Joy but arrive too late during the final confrontation at the school's [[Auditorium|theater hall/auditorium]] as the doors were tightly shut and locked by the angered spirit of Belonia, who was ready to take Joy. Lui's attempts to tear the picture proved impervious as the nun's curse remained in the picture and that mere physical force cannot destroy a spirit.  Realizing this, Joy asks the help from the spirits of the three missing students. Surprisingly, the ghosts of Crisel, Sabel and Adela reappeared too and tore the picture apart. A screaming Belonia vanishes from the living world and is placed into the depths of [[hell]] while the ghostly trio peacefully then depart for the Afterlife. With all the terror ended, the group finished and inaugurated the exhibit, but were suspended for unexplainable loss of their classmates, a fact that made their school status parallel to Sis. Belonia, Crisel, Sabel, and Adela.  ===Nieves===  ====Plot==== Nieves (Nye-ves) ([[Marian Rivera]]) is a happy-go-lucky but a fierce engkantolarya (''[[Engkanto]]'' slayer). While on a walk at the forest one day, she was pursued by an ''engkanto'', Hagnaya ([[Marco Alcaraz]]). Saying that she has got no crush on him, she vanished the poor ''engkanto'' away.  It was revealed that Nieves lives with her husband Adonis (Mike Nacua), a handsome man and ''engkanto'' heartthrob. But one stormy night, the young man was intentionally kidnapped by an engkanto. With this, Nieves formally resigned her job.  Meanwhile, a family from [[Manila]] spends their vacation in a new house bound by a large tree. Celso ([[Mart Escudero]]), however, was brainwashed and was forced to cut the tree, thus creating a new problem for his family.  Junie ([[Robert Villar]]), Celso's little nephew, went to see Nieves, along with a young girl named Kaysee ([[Jennica Garcia]]) after gaining information from Aling Tasing (Malou Crisologo). However, Nieves reluctantly welcomes them, but after seeing a begging Junie, she offered them to be trained as soon as possible.  Kaysee and Junie trekked back to Nieves's home when they were welcomed by the townsfolk, complaining about the new attacks of dwarves, elves, kapres, etc. The engkantolarya, still reluctant to resume her job, finally agreed to continue her post.  Junie's parents ([[Luis Alandy]] and [[Desiree Del Valle]]) seek help from Nieves when something happened wrong again: Celso fell ill, this time, his illness became worse. Nieves explained why the young man fell ill: he cut the tree in the backyard, which was the home of Hagnaya and his wife, Wai Lana ([[Iwa Moto]]). It was also revealed that the voice that brainwashed Celso was the engkanto queen herself, Acacia ([[Diana Zubiri]]).  Nieves negotiated with Wai Lana and Hagnaya personally, explaining that Celso did not mean to cut down the tree and offered them that she will help find their new home. On the contrary, Kaysee, who went with a walk with Junie one day, revealed herself as Acacia.  Sensing danger, Junie ran to Nieves and told her what he saw. The engkanto slayer was given a special suit blessed by the good ''engkanto'' colony. As they speak, Acacia ensnared the townsfolk to her lair.  Nieves confronted Acacia while Junie healed the townsfolk from entrancement. As the two ladies fight, it was revealed that Acacia had Adonis held hostage under a hill. In anger, the engkanto queen tortured the engkantolarya mercilessly. Enraged, the young slayer threw a repellent in the air while Junie hit it with his sling-stone, killing Acacia in the process.  With Adonis back, Nieves and the townsfolk rejoiced.  
Shades of Ray

He auditions for roles by day and works as a bartender at night.  He lives with his lifelong best friend, Sal.  As a child, Rey's father taught him that he should marry a Pakistani woman and follow a Muslim morality.  However, Rey only dates white women and is only vaguely Muslim.  He also leads his father to believe that he is an investment banker, though his mother knows the full truth about his career and his love life.  Rey proposes to his girlfriend, Noelle, and despite insisting that she wants to say yes, she tells him that she has to put off her answer until after a family vacation so that she can get her parents to agree to the marriage.  Ray is disappointed but optimistic.  When he comes home one evening, his father has come all the way from New Jersey and is sitting on his porch.  Ray learns that his mother threw his father out.  He insists that his parents try to reconcile, but his father says he will only agree to if Ray agrees to meet with the daughter of one of his Pakistani friends living in LA.  Irritated and promising nothing, Ray agrees.  During the course of the dinner, which includes Ray, his father, Sana (the daughter) and Sana's parents, Ray and Sana go outside and soon discover that they have a lot in common, not the least of which is their half-white, half-Pakistani heritage.  At the close of evening, Ray's father concludes that Ray does like Sana, a fact that confuses and frustrates Ray; he reveals to his father that he has proposed to Noelle and is awaiting her answer.  Ray and Sana then meet by chance in a bookstore, and they connect further.  While Ray and his father are golfing, Noelle calls and tells Ray that she is tired of trying to please her parents and that she will marry him, to Ray's delight.  Meanwhile, Ray's parents have some contentious phone conversations, sparked by Ray's pleas for a reconciliation.  Ray's mother surprises everyone by appearing on Ray's doorstep, and the parents work to make amends.  Tensions flare, however, when the mother finds out that the father put Ray up to seeing Sana.  As they argue, Ray gets a text message from Sana and they tacitly agree to meet up again.  Ray's mother finds him and tells him that she apologizes if she ever discouraged him from meeting girls that were more like him; they hug and he goes to work.  Noelle suddenly comes to visit Ray, but finds his parents home instead.  She casually mentions that Ray works at a bar, which infuriates Ray's father.  Meanwhile, at work, Sana comes to visit Ray; she is tipsy and very flirtatious and encourages him to take his break.  She pulls him into the men's bathroom and begins to caress him; he mildly protests, saying he needs to tell her something, but eventually concedes to a kiss.  He then suddenly shouts "I'm engaged" to a stunned Sana, before he apologizes profusely and exits the bathroom to find Noelle standing there.  Moments later, a breathless Sana exits.  Noelle storms out.  A little later, his father appears, furious about Ray's deceit.  Ray explains that he does not know how to do the things his father wants, namely, make a lot of money and marry a Pakistani woman.  Ray also accuses his father of hypocrisy, as he did not conform to Pakistani ideals either.  After work, Ray finds a very angry Noelle at her home.  After he assures her that he didn't have sex with Sana, he hesitantly agrees to never see Sana again and the couple agrees to never discuss the incident again.  The next day, he meets Sana at her house and apologizes to her again but explains that he had never met anyone who understood him better than her.  Sana seems to cheer up and tells him she is leaving to teach English in Mexico.  They hug.  Later, Ray has a conversation with Sal about fate, and Sal asserts that everyone can make their own choices.  The conversation inspires Ray to go and end his engagement with Noelle.  Three months pass and Sana (who has a weekend off) stops by with a sombrero she brought him from Mexico.  They reconnect and they have lunch together.

Ultimately, David defeats the Mafia, saves Laura and finds the treasure, which his father had died searching for. Clemenza is killed by one of the sharks when he falls in the water while fighting David.  It is unclear whether it is a scientific phenomenon leading to the gradual increase in the temperature of the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]] and the presence of at least one [[Great white shark]] taking up residence in the city of [[Venice]].<ref>[http://www.mannbeisstfilm.de/kritik/Danny-Lerner/Shark-in-Venice/1677.html Danny Lerner Shark in Venice Filmkritik Rezension Kritik]</ref> Later in the film Clemenza appears to tell David that he is the one who has introduced the sharks to the waterways.

While travelling by car in the wilderness of the countryside, Jane accidentally hits a girl standing in the middle of the road and ends up running over her. They could not find a body or even a trace of blood and decide to leave, thinking the victim was all right and had left. They later start to find mysterious lights in their photos, which are later identified as [[spirit photography]] by Ben's assistant, Seiko Nakamura (Maya Hazen). Jane begins to have eerie dreams and visions as if they are trying to tell her something and senses a haunting presence stalking them. Ben begins to complain of severe shoulder pain and his friends begin to comment he's looking bent and hunched over, although the doctor could not determine what was the actual physical cause of it. Seiko takes Jane to her ex-boyfriend, Ritsuo ([[James Kyson Lee]]), whose career is to investigate paranormal activities, and he tells them that the lights in the photos are spirits as well as manifestations of intense emotions that are trying to be communicated. At a subway station, Jane spots the ghostly presence of the girl she hit and ran over, causing her to believe that she killed the girl. Later, Ben also has a similarly-terrifying encounter. They go to a [[mediumship|medium]], Murase, to find out what spiritual activity is really happening to them. However, after Murase clearly appears to have stumbled upon something, Ben refuses to translate what Murase says and storms out, claiming that he is a fraud.  Jane decides to visit the office building in one of the photos. She takes pictures and encounters the [[yūrei]], and learns that the girl's name was Megumi Tanaka and that Ben knew her. When she confronts Ben about it, he admits that he and Megumi were once involved in a relationship, but that after the death of her father, she became very obsessive and clingy, and eventually he walked out on her, with help from his two friends.  Ben's friends, Adam ([[John Hensley]]) and Bruno ([[David Denman]]), are killed by Megumi. After witnessing Bruno's death, Ben wants to leave but Jane hands Ben their wedding photo, which shows a distorted picture of Megumi. They realize she's been with them the entire time and go to Megumi's home, only to find her decayed body. She had committed suicide with [[potassium cyanide]] long before the car impact and thus they had actually first encountered her as a ghost at that time.  That night, Ben is tortured by Megumi. Jane screams at Megumi to leave them alone; Megumi stops with a brief sinister laugh, leaving Ben alive. After Megumi's funeral, Ben and Jane return to New York, thinking it's all over. However, Jane finds some recent photos in an envelope which show Megumi. With Megumi's clues, Jane finds a camera in a trunk and uploads the memory card into the laptop. There, Jane sees photos taken by Ben, showing Adam and Bruno raping Megumi before her suicide, while Ben does nothing but watch them doing the deed.  Ben returns home, where he tries to explain to a distraught Jane that he felt it was the only way to drive Megumi away. They had planned on using the pictures as blackmail against Megumi if she didn't leave him alone but it turned into rape. This explains why Megumi murdered Adam and Bruno, as Ben knew this was about revenge against all three of them. Believing that Megumi was trying to warn her, and disgusted by Ben's past actions, Jane concludes that she can't spend her life with someone like Ben so she leaves him. Ben tries to stop her, but Megumi locks the door and doesn't let him.  Driven mad by Megumi, Ben throws the camera across the room. It takes a picture of him, showing Megumi sitting astride his shoulders. Remembering his shoulder pains and the hospital where a nurse weighed Ben and it showed the weight of two people, Ben realizes that Megumi has been with him all along since her suicide without his knowledge. Horrified, and in a desperate attempt to rid himself of her, he electrocutes himself. He is rendered [[catatonic]] and sent to a mental institution, where he is shown sitting slumped over on the edge of his bed. The last scene shows Megumi still draped over his back.

Signs of the Time (film)
 Baseball of the 19th century was America's most popular spectator sport. Professional teams like the 1889 [[Brooklyn Bridegrooms]] drew nearly a half a million fans per season. Thousands of fans attended some of the earliest known games, but without the benefit of the signals on the diamond to tell them what was happening on the field. There were no signals for strike, safe, out or foul and no announcer to interpret the game. Prior to the invention of baseball signs, the only signal was the umpire's voice, often drowned out by the roar of thousands of excited fans. ''Signs of the Time'' explores the origins of this innovation and the baseball pioneers that changed the course of the game and history.  Several have laid claim to the signs and signals that have influenced America's game but only two deserve consideration. The first is [[Bill Klem]], the most significant [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] of the last century and the first to be inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]. He spent nearly forty years in professional baseball from 1905 to 1942, influencing many of the greatest legends of the game. He was well known for his authoritative style behind the plate and his boastful demeanor in public.  The second man was [[Dummy Hoy|William "Dummy" Hoy]], who since the age of two, was profoundly [[deaf]] and unable to speak. Hoy was drafted by the professional [[Oshkosh Baseball Club]] in 1886. Through his career from 1886–1903, Hoy was admired by his teammates, revered by the fans, and became the most celebrated deaf player in the history of big-league baseball.  Both of these men made significant contributions to the game and each has laid claim to the signs of baseball. ''Signs of the Time'' exposes the myths and mysteries of the game with anecdotes of the past, depictions of early baseball and interviews with the most influential names of the game.  
Shuttle (film)
 Mel ([[Peyton List (actress born 1986)|Peyton List]]) and Jules ([[Cameron Goodman]]) are best friends returning to [[Los Angeles]] from a trip in [[Mexico]]. Seth ([[James Snyder (actor)|James Snyder]]) and Matt (Dave Power) arrive and introduce themselves to them. Jules takes Mel into the bathroom to help her deal with her [[motion sickness]], where Mel tells her that she has broken up with her fiancé.  Mel's luggage is lost in the airport, so she must return the next day to get it. Outside, they board a [[shuttle bus]] after its Driver ([[Tony Curran]]) offers to charge them half the price of a regular shuttle. On board, they meet Andy ([[Cullen Douglas]]), a shy family man. Seth and Matt see them and attempt to board, but the Driver tells them he can only make three stops at a time. Jules informs him that the men are with them.   During the trip, Mel shows Matt her [[sign language|signing]] skills while Seth and Jules flirt with each other. While taking an unusual detour, they are run off the road by a car, and the Driver gets out to survey the damage, which turns out to be a flat tire. Jules opts to call a taxi, but there is no service where they are. Matt offers to help change the tire. While his hand is on top of the tire, the Driver looks for some nuts for the wheel. Suddenly, the bus falls off the [[jack (device)|jack]] and onto Matt's hand, severing his fingers. They quickly drive off to the hospital.  During the ride, the Driver calmly pulls over, much to the astonishment of the passengers. He pulls a gun on them and demands cooperation, taking everyone's phones and wallets. While Mel and Seth argue about doing something, Jules finds a flare under the seat from the safety kit used to bandage Matt's hand, and Mel comes up with a plan to get the window open. Andy sees her and causes a commotion. A struggle ensues and the flare is set ablaze. The Driver sees this, stops the bus and removes the flare. Jules runs for the front and finds the door locked and the key missing.   The Driver re-enters and slashes Seth's face with a switchblade as a warning to the others. He informs them of a "change of plans", and drives them to an enclosed ATM for Jules to withdraw money. While she is inside, she knocks some paper into a bin and sets it on fire to set off an alarm. The Driver sees this and rushes towards her, but she slams the door. Mel escapes, but the Driver shouts at her that he will let Jules suffocate from smoke inhalation if she doesn't return to the bus.  At a supermarket, Mel signs into the closed-circuit camera her plight and gives the clerk a note to check the recording. Seth gets free, makes a run for it and is run over by the bus. His body is put on the bus. The clerk finds that the cctv was never turned on. Later, Mel shows Matt a knife she hid in the ice, which she uses to cut their belts off. Matt uses the ice bag to smash the window, and they all shout for help. When the driver walks towards them with a gun, Mel cuts the guy's wrist with the knife, and Matt hits him over the head with the bag. Mel grabs the gun and threatens to shoot the Driver. She makes him hand over the keys to the belts, and Jules is able to get herself and Andy free.  She takes the wheel of the bus and drives, leaving Matt with the gun and Andy with the knife. Andy then nonchalantly stabs Matt in the throat, which no one notices at first. He grabs the gun and puts it to Mel's head, telling her to get away from the pedals. Andy then reveals himself to be in league with the Driver. They stop at a bridge to throw the boys' bodies off, and afterward, Andy torments the girls for a few minutes before the Driver gets him to stop.  Mel get a tire iron from under the seat, and keeps it by her side. Andy wraps tape around the girls' mouths and takes a cuff of their hair. Mel hits him several times with the tire iron and the Driver is forced to stop. She pulls herself free, and the Driver attempts to get the gun, only for her to hit him on the hand, and knock it towards Jules. Mel seizes control and drives away, but he rushes towards her. She slams the brakes and accelerates to throw him about. She reaches for a knife and stabs him in the knee. Andy comes over to attack her but she grabs a fire extinguisher and hits him with it. The bus then crashes into a wall during the struggle.  Jules finds Andy dead and the driver and Mel unconscious; he flags down a passing car but while dialing 911 the bus runs over him. The Driver then takes them to a warehouse, where he forcibly removes a tattoo from Jules' body; he also takes the girls' driving licences and puts them in a drawer which is already full of other IDs of people the Driver has kidnapped or murdered before.  He has Jules dye Mel's hair blonde, then makes Mel and Jules strip down to their underwear and wear white high heels for an inspection. The man who inspects them is revealed to be the man that ran them off the road earlier, and the same man who was seen observing them at the airport in the opening scene. The Driver inspects their bags and finds that Jules has [[Antifungal medication]] for a [[yeast infection]]. Since Jules is of no use to the Driver since he needs the girls to both be in good health, he takes her onto the bus and [[carbon monoxide poisoning|gasses her with a tube connected to the exhaust]].  He finds Mel, who threatens to cut her face with a shard of glass, which would make her useless to him as well. Instead, she stabs him in the arm with it. He attempts to disarm her, but she stabs it into his thigh before hitting him in the face with some light fixtures. She finds the gun and shoots him, the bullet skimming his head. Thinking he is dead, she tries to escape in the bus. However, before it can start, the Driver attacks her again. They grapple for a minute before he forces her into a large wooden crate, which contains the items Mel purchased earlier in the grocery store: a flashlight, a loaf of bread, two jugs of water, two magazines, kitty litter, and a litter box, as well as her motion sickness pills.  Trapped inside the dark crate, Mel yells for help, but no one is there, and when someone with a forklift comes, he turns out to be in on the operation. While being carried away, she finds a photo of seven young white women in what looks like a filthy underground cellar. The photo depicts the despondent-looking girls completely naked, hair dyed blonde, and wearing white high heels (like Mel and Jules were forced to wear). It is heavily implied that these girls were also kidnapped by the Driver at some point and forced to become sex slaves overseas. Mel looks at the photo in horror as she realizes that she is to become a sex slave too. The crate is then loaded onto a cargo ship destined for [[East Asia]].  The final shot is of Mel's lost luggage turning up at the airport as another day begins.

Silambattam (film)
 Vichu ([[Silambarasan]]) is a quiet village priest brought up by his maternal grandfather ([[Nedumudi Venu]]). Owing to specific reasons, the caring elder has purposefully toned down (Simbu uses his eyes to convey the inner quietude of Vichu) the young boy's emotional quotient and has taught him a peculiar art of living. As a result, Vichu is soft-spoken, passive and is groomed to tolerate all sorts of malicious misdemeanors aimed at him. Vichu assists his grandfather in carrying out the religious rituals as well as being the care-taker of the temple. Vichu's only consolation comes in the company of his sweetheart Janu ([[Sana Khan]]). Janu's kiddish jokes and teasing remarks make up for all the precious and youthful moments he has missed in his growing-up years.  Though Vichu abides by his elder's advice, an incident in the temple premises reveals his real persona. On the particular day, Vichu witnesses a big band of ruffians bashing a seemingly meek individual. Becoming furious at the sight of the power-play, Vichu gets into the tussle and saves the victim. But, as the man takes a hard look at his saviour face, he is stunned! What is the secrecy in Vichu's past? How does it intimidate the stranger?  Cut to a flashback, there is a huge clash between the two village groups headed by Muthuvel ([[Prabhu]]) and Veeraiyan ([[Ponvannan]]). Reason? Veeriayan claims back every bit of land he has donated to the landless and poor villagers whereas Muthuvel and his brother Tamizharasan ([[Silambarasan]]) oppose his order. In the violent power-struggle, too many people die. It includes the fervent activist Tamizh, his dear wife Gayathri ([[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]]) and Veeraiyan himself. Veeraiyan stabs himself and says that Tamizh stabbed him to death. The police come in search of Tamizh but he is missing in the house. He is with Gayathri on that night in a goods train. Tamizh is produced before court and as he was missing on that night, he is doubted and granted punishment. But Gayathri intervenes and says that she spent that night along with Tamizh on that train. She says that they behaved like how a husband & wife would be in each other's company. It's proven and Tamizh is released. Only Veeraiyan's last son Duraisingham ([[Kishore (actor)|Kishore]] of [[Polladhavan (2007 film)|Polladhavan]] fame) and Muthuvel are spared in the tragedy. The burning intensity of the mishap stays alive in Duraisingham's heart and Muthuvel is another witness to the past. What happens next? Duraisingam enters Muthuvel's house and kills everyone including Tamizh. A large group of rowdies enter and kill the rest. It is revealed that Gayathri escapes to her father's home and later, dies giving birth to Vichu. The rest of the film is about Vichu settling the long-term dispute and explaining the situation to his grandfather.  
Singh Is Kinng
 Lakhan Singh ([[Sonu Sood]]), a.k.a. Lucky, is the "kinng of the Australian underworld." He is accompanied by his Sikh mafia associates, Julie ([[Neha Dhupia]]), Mika ([[Jaaved Jaffrey]]), Pankaj Udaas ([[Yashpal Sharma (actor)|Yashpal Sharma]]), Raftaar ([[Sudhanshu Pandey]]), Dilbaugh Singh ([[Manoj Pahwa]]) and Guruji Gurbaksh Singh (Kamal Chopra). In a small village in Punjab, the birthplace of Lucky, there lives another Sikh, Happy Singh ([[Akshay Kumar]]). Happy, though good at heart, has unintentionally caused many problems in the village, and the villagers are fed up with him. They decide to send Happy on a long trip to Australia with his friend Rangeela ([[Om Puri]]) to bring Lucky back to Punjab, which will keep Happy out of the village for some time and bring peace to the village.  But at the airport, Happy's and Rangeela's tickets to Australia are accidentally exchanged with those of Puneet ([[Ranvir Shorey]]), who was to fly to Egypt. In Egypt, Happy meets Sonia ([[Katrina Kaif]]) and falls deeply in love with her. But he does not express his love to her. Leaving her behind, he heads to Australia to meet Lucky. Lucky refuses to return to his hometown and throws Happy and Rangeela out of his house. Penniless, Happy finds warmth and affection in an elderly lady ([[Kirron Kher]]) who provides him with food in spite of being a stranger.  Lucky winds up in hospital, paralyzed, after a series of violent incidents that Happy has caused. (In one of these incidents, his head is bumped severely, and the trauma from the resultant concussion is what paralyzes him.) Unexpectedly, it is Happy who is given the position of the "Kinng." The lady who helped Happy is obviously worried and depressed, as her daughter is returning from Egypt with her wealthy boyfriend, Puneet. The daughter does not know that after the death of her father years ago, her mother had become poverty-stricken and been reduced to work as a flower seller. Happy gives her Lucky's spacious house and makes all his mafia associates work for her.  The lady's daughter arrives; to Happy's horror, she is none other than Sonia. Heartbroken, Happy is forced to make a show of happiness to Sonia. Puneet says that he too would have had a good time with Happy and Sonia in Egypt had his ticket to Egypt not been exchanged in the airport, because of which he had ended up in Australia. Puneet had always been jealous of Sonia being with Happy; however, he doubts something is going on between them.  Meanwhile, Lucky's gang members spend enough time with the kindhearted Kinng for most of them to be reformed and give up lawless lives in favour of law-abiding ones.  In spite of herself, Sonia falls in love with Happy and the truth becomes difficult to hide. Puneet sets his heart to marry Sonia. Sonia gets trapped in an emotional tug-of-war between Puneet, who loves her, and Happy, whom she loves.  In the confusion, Happy's associates reveal to Puneet who they are, and that Happy is the Kinng of the Australian underworld, not a manager as Puneet had believed him to be. Puneet, in turn, reveals this to Sonia, who has become aware of her own poverty.  Soon Puneet meets Mika, Lucky's other brother, who agrees to kill Happy. Puneet's motives to kill Happy, however, differ from Mika's: Puneet wants to kill Happy to keep Sonia away from him, whereas Mika wants to kill Happy to make himself Kinng.  On the dawn of the wedding day, the sound of gunshots firing can be heard. Happy takes Sonia in order to save her--and unknowingly, both run around the fire seven times, essentially getting married. (During all this, Lucky's head is bumped, and the trauma-induced paralysis he had suffered from is relieved.) Suddenly, Mika turns up on the spot, ready to kill Happy, armed with a gang and his new special glasses and hearing aid. As he is about to shoot, Lucky steps up and stops him. Then a dialogue ensues between Mika, Happy, Lucky, and the associates of the Kinng. Then Happy tells him that being the "kinng" is not as great as it may seem and explains him the characteristics of a true Sikh. Lucky confesses that he had always found being Kinng a source of misery, because a true kinng fights for others, not for himself. Overcome with remorse, Mika drops his gun. The movie ends with Happy's and Sonia's marriage and the returns of Lucky and his gang members to their homes in the village.

In Turkey, she immerses herself in an [[archaeological dig]] under Professor Nasrin Mehani ([[Shohreh Aghdashloo]]), who notices how glibly Bridget treats the past.  After reading her grandmother's letters, Bridget leaves the dig early to visit Greta in Alabama, where she learns that her mother, who committed suicide, denied having [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].  Though Bridget's father had accepted this, Greta could not and cut ties with both of them.

She returns to the Rhode Island School of Design and begins dating Leo ([[Jesse Williams (actor)|Jesse Williams]]), the model for her [[life class]].  When Kostas comes to see her, revealing that marriage was [[annulled]] after his wife revealed she was never pregnant, Lena forgives him but refuses him because she does not believe they are the same people any more.  However, after spending time with Leo, she realizes some people only fall in love once and she still cares for Kostas.    Tibby has been working at a video store in New York while retaking a NYU screenwriting class that requires her to finish her script.

Lena brings Tibby a requested pregnancy test kit, but Tibby gets her period before she takes it. Tibby drives to Vermont, hoping for Carmen's support. After arguing over who ignores the other more, Tibby leaves. She ends going to Brian's house and apologizes, confessing that she had been afraid dealing with change.  Realizing that he loves Tibby, Brian breaks up with Effie.  Carmen attends an actor workshop in Vermont, prompted by fellow Yale student, Julia ([[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]]).

Carmen talks about how she connects with Perdita, winning her the part, while Julia, though clearly jealous, promises to help Carmen.  Initially uncertain about her acting abilities, Carmen grows more confident when her talent is recognized by the director and the other actors, including Ian, with whom she begins a flirtatious friendship. Julia grows more jealous, and her competition for Ian upsets Carmen.  Carmen believes Ian would prefer to be with Julia, so she declines his offers to practice and falters in rehearsals. Also, feeling her friends ignored her all year, she pushes Tibby away, but reconciles with her after her mother Christina ([[Rachel Ticotin]]) goes into labor. Carmen asks Tibby to help after she and her stepfather (Paul Coughlan) cannot get to the hospital in time.  Ian comforts Carmen, who is distressed over missing her mother's labor. Ian prefers Carmen to Julia, who pursues him. Carmen overhears Julia tell director Bill to replace Carmen, but he does not. She performs spectacularly, regains confidence, and kisses Ian after the play. While packing to leave, she finally tells Julia off.  Effie, upset with Brian breaking up with her and how Lena seems to love her friends more than her own sister, steals the Pants and loses them in Greece while visiting her grandmother. The Sisterhood disagrees over whether the Pants are worth saving, so Lena travels to Greece first. The other girls follow to help, and convince the reluctant Lena to take back Kostas. Although they do not find the Pants, the summer ends in Greece with a renewal of their mutual commitment to each other.  
Sita Sings the Blues
  ===The ''Ramayana''=== The film uses a pared-down adaptation of the legend that retains many of its finer details while adopting a perspective sympathetic towards [[Sita]]; in the director's words, the film is "a tale of truth, justice and a woman’s cry for equal treatment."<ref name="Press">Director Nina Paley's [http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/press.html long synopsis] from the press section at [http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/ SitaSingstheBlues.com], retrieved May 4, 2008</ref>  The plot joins the legend at the exile of prince [[Rama]] from his father's court, at the behest of his father's favorite queen, [[Kaikeyi]]. Having earned the right to any single favor by saving the king's life, Kaikeyi attempts to secure her own son's inheritance over the eldest and favorite, Rama, by ordering him banished from the court. Sita, Rama's wife, determines to accompany her beloved husband, although the woods are dangerous and overrun with demons and evil spirits. The demon king [[Ravana]], encouraged by his spiteful ogress sister, hears of Sita's beauty and determines to kidnap her. He sends a golden [[Deer|hind]] past their dwelling to distract Rama, who tries to impress Sita by hunting the hind into the woods. In his absence, Ravana abducts Sita and demands that she submit to him on pain of death. Sita remains staunchly devoted to Rama and refuses to entertain the idea; Ravana sets a deadline for the ultimatum and Sita waits faithfully for Rama to rescue her.  Aided by the monkey prince [[Hanuman]], Rama eventually discovers Sita's location and brings the monkey army to assist in her rescue. Ravana is slain and Sita restored to her husband, although he expresses serious doubts concerning her fidelity during her confinement. She submits to a trial by fire, a test of her purity; upon throwing herself into the flames, she is immediately rescued by the gods, who all proclaim her devotion and fidelity.  She accompanies Rama back to the palace, and soon falls pregnant. Lingering doubts still play on Rama's mind, however, and after overhearing one of his subjects beating and ejecting an unfaithful consort (claiming he is no Rama to accept and forgive her unfaithfulness), he orders his reluctant brother [[Lakshman]] to abandon Sita in the forest. In the company of ascetics she gives birth to her sons and raises them to love and praise their absent father. Years later, Rama overhears their hymns of adoration to their father and locates their dwelling. Distressed and disappointed by Rama's continuing doubt on her purity during her reunion with Rama, Sita prays to the earth to swallow her as final proof of her purity and devotion and the prayer is duly answered, despite the pleas of Rama and Lakshman.  ===Contemporary parallel=== In an episode taken from the director's own life,<ref name="Press"/> animator Nina Paley starts the film living happily in a San Francisco apartment with her husband and cat. Her husband then accepts the offer of a six-month contract working in [[Trivandrum]], [[India]], and moves there alone to take up the position. After a month of no contact, he calls to inform his wife that the contract has been extended another year.  Bewildered by his callous indifference to their separation, Nina sublets their apartment, leaves their beloved cat behind and joins her husband in India. Upon her arrival he appears deeply unenthusiastic to be reunited and demonstrates neither affection nor sexual interest. A while later, Nina flies to a meeting in New York, where she receives a brief e-mail from her husband telling her that their relationship is over. Sad and alone, she stays in New York, finding comfort in a new cat and her study of the ''Ramayana''.

Similarly, second couple's serious problem is not looked upon as a problem at all by the first and likewise so, with the other two couples. In a pursuit to achieve what they lack and in a desperate search of that one thing that would solve all their problems, they find themselves lost in the ever moving crowd, where no one has time for themselves, leave aside the cares of the world.  In due course of time, all four couples come together with a distant vision of that one event which would end all their problems and set them free. Is it reality or just a figment of their vivid imagination?  
Six Reasons Why
  Four men stand staring one another down before a shootout. In a flashback one of the gunslingers, The Nomad, shows he shot a man in the Badlands named Milton while he is describing a vision of paradise just beyond the dunes. The Nomad loots through Milton's remains before camping for the night. That night the Nomad dreams of the preacher who sent him into the desert to protect a mysterious city, reminding him to make sure the horse is looked after. The Nomad wakes up realizing that the horse is more important to the mission than he is, and that he was never to see his home again. Rather than kill the next desert intruder, The Nomad conspires with him in faking his own death, which causes the horse to head home, tracked and followed by the Nomad. After the deal is struck, the Nomad goes to stop two more intruders entering the badlands. Now knowing his horse is actually an enemy, The Nomad takes a liking to the two strangers, The Entrepreneur and The Sherpa and chooses to stay with them. After a day of travel and a congenial dinner, they fall sleep around the fire. The Nomad again dreams of the preacher and his warnings. When the Nomad wakes up he finds his horse has vanished. Believing the two new strangers are responsible, he attacks them and ties them up for questioning. He finally realizes the culprit must have been the shady stranger from the day before.  Back at the 4-way shootout the tension is building as guns are drawn. The Entrepreneur's flashback shows him standing at a river with his father, discussing the opening of a new monorail station that is currently under construction, leading into the desert Badlands. The next morning the Entrepreneur's father is assassinated by The Criminal, who flees into the desert. That evening, The Entrepreneur and his servant, The Sherpa, are drinking at a bar when a loudmouth begins insulting The Entrepreneur's father's memory. The Entrepreneur drunkenly beats the patron to death with his pistol. Once he and The Sherpa realize he would be arrested for the crime, they flee into the desert to chase down his father's assassin.  Once again, back at the shootout the Entrepreneur reaches for his pistol. This time, the Criminal's flashback shows he was hired to kill the Monorail Tycoon, which he does before fleeing in to the desert. He meets the Nomad, who spares his life so he can fake his own death and leave the Badlands. The Criminal agrees to a deal and consents to meet up with the Nomad in two days. Later, The Criminal spots The Nomad at a campfire with the son of his last kill. He assumes he has been betrayed and steals the horse.  Returning to the 4-way shootout, six gunshots are heard and each man falls to the ground, leaving the horse still standing. After the sun begins to set, one man stirs, gets up and follows the horse home.<ref name="SixReasonsWhy.com"/>

Sleep Dealer
  ''Sleep Dealer'' is set in a future, militarized world marked by closed borders, virtual labor and a global digital network that joins minds and experiences, where three strangers risk their lives to connect with each other and break the barriers of technology.  Memo Cruz works at a factory, one of several sleep dealers. Here, workers are connected to the network via suspended cables that plug into nodes in their arms and back, allowing them to control the robots that have replaced them as unskilled labor on the other side of the border. The sleep dealers are called so because one may collapse if one works long enough. The story is told as a flashback, as Memo remembers his home in Santa Ana Del Rio, [[Oaxaca]]. His father wants him to participate in growing crops on the meager family homestead. Memo's passion, however, is electronics and hacking. The homestead also has dried up on account of a dam built nearby and owned by the private corporation Del Rio Water. Memo and his father must trek on foot to buy water by the bag, while monitored by security cameras armed with machine guns. The media on American hi-def TV shows glimpses of a technological dystopia, although in a positive light with superficial spin-doctoring. As a hobby, Memo is building an electronic receiver that can tap into communications. As he continues to work on it, its range increases to far away cities.  One summer, a remote-controlled military aerial vehicle operated by the security forces of Del Rio Water catches Memo monitoring a frequency used by the drones, an act that warrants a brutal attack. He disconnects in time before the drone can locate him with certainty. On another occasion, he and his brother watch a live TV broadcast about a drone action that is about to destroy a building known to be intercepting drone communication. They quickly realize that the building is their own home where Memo has his equipment, and run to save their father whose life is in danger. However, they are too late, and the vehicle launches a rocket at the father, instantly killing him. The pilot of the drone is shown to be Rudy Ramirez. Memo boards a bus to the city Tijuana to find work.  The same bus is also boarded by Luz Martínez. Memo notices that Luz has nodes on the wrist for interfacing with the digital network, and asks her where he can get them for free. She tells him that he can find someone, known as a coyotek, to connect him by asking around in a certain alley. Luz has loans and may default. She makes a living by uploading memories to an online memory trading company, TruNode, where viewers pay for content. She uploads her memory of meeting Memo.  Memo is robbed of his money during his first attempt to seek a coyotek. He finds an abandoned shack in which to stay at the edge of the city, where other node workers live. Luz gets a sale for her memory of Memo, and a prepaid offer for her next memory of him. Luz finds him and comes to know he is out of money. She helps him get a node-job at a bar that has the equipment. It so happens that she is the coyotek, having learned from her ex-boyfriend, and she does him a favor.  Luz tries to upload more experiences. TruNode makes her reveal feelings rather than just the story. The person who requested the information is revealed to be Ramirez working for Del Rio Water.  Luz and Memo open up to each other and have a connected sex. Upon receiving the next upload, Ramirez has his doubts confirmed that his work made him kill a good man.  Memo discovers that Luz has been paid to upload her memories of him, and so he leaves her feeling betrayed. He works over-time at the sleep-dealer, risking exhaustion. Luz writes to him and mails him a recording of her memories as a parting gift. In the meantime, Ramirez has crossed the fortified US-Mexican border to meet Memo. As Ramirez explains himself, Memo tries to run perceiving danger. Ramirez catches up and explains he was under orders and offers to help.  Memo rejoins Luz and recruits her help to connect Ramirez into the network. He accesses the Del Rio Water security network to control one of the company's drones. Upon discovery that Ramirez is not heeding orders, Ramirez is pursued by other drones. After heated aerial dogfighting, Ramirez manages to blast a hole in the dam, directly where Memo's father had once tossed a pebble in helpless frustration. Memo receives news from his home and neighboring subsistence farms, celebrations of the return of ancestral waters, albeit not necessarily a permanent one. Ramirez goes farther south in Mexico as he is no longer able to return to his family in the US. Memo moves on with his life in Tijuana.  
The Sky Crawlers (film)
  ''The Sky Crawlers'' is set in an [[alternate history|alternative history]] timeline where although the world is at peace, in order to ease the tension of a populace accustomed to war and aggression, private corporations contract fighter pilots to engage in actual combat operations against each other. The film introduces a mystery involving characters called  - humanoids genetically engineered in a way that enables them to live eternally in adolescence.  After the deaths of three pilots of the Rostock Corporation at the hands of a J2 Skyly piloted by the Lautern ace pilot 'Teacher', Yūichi Kannami is reassigned to Area 262. After meeting with the Chief Mechanic Towa Sasakura, he inquires as to the fate of the predecessor who had left the Sanka Mk.B pusher-prop assigned to him in pristine condition prior to his disappearance. Kannami is told to ask the base's CO Suito Kusanagi, who quickly dismisses him after informing him of a sortie that is to take place the following day. Shortly afterward, he meets the rest of the base's piloting corps: Aizu Yudagawa, Yuriyuki Shinota and Naofumi Tokino. After observing Yudagawa folding a newspaper in a certain way, Kannami learns that the fifth pilot in Area 262 is Kusanagi.  Tokino and Kannami embark upon a reconnaissance mission the following day, which is interrupted by three enemy fighters from the Lautern Corporation. The three pilots are quickly dispatched and the duo return to the base without incident. Once again, Kannami inquires as to the fate of his predecessor Kurita Jinroh, while questioning if Kusanagi is a Kildren as well. Less than willing to reveal the details of Jinroh's absence as well as information about her own nature, Kusanagi ignores Kannami's questions by dismissing him. Later that evening, Tokino and Kannami visit Danielle's Diner, where they are met shortly afterward by Kusumi and Fuuko - the latter of which Kannami has sex with. Fuuko informs Kannami of the relationship she had with Jinroh, while acknowledging that Kannami's existence must mean that Jinroh is no longer alive.  Returning from sortie early due to an oil leak, Kannami meets Mizuki Kusanagi, who introduces herself as Suito's younger sister, who inquires as to the nature of the Kildren. Tokino, returning later, reveals that Mizuki is not Suito's younger sister, but rather Suito's daughter. Discussing the matter with Suito, she wonders what will happen when Mizuki reaches Suito's age, revealing that Suito is indeed a Kildren. Speaking with Yudagawa later, he reveals that Kusanagi is always armed, and that she was the one who apparently shot Jinro.  A sponsor tour of the base is interrputed by the downing of a Rostock Sanka Mk.B from the neighbouring area. Arriving on the scene, Kusanagi berates a group of civilian observers for pitying the killed pilot before leaving the scene with Kannami. Later, Kannami visits the diner again, but his leave is cut short by the arrival of Lautern heavy bombers. Able to warn the base of the arriving bombers, Kusanagi sorties the pilots, taking Kannami's plane in his absence. The two visit theatre command, where they are met with an officer trying to bar them from meeting with Kusanagi's superior. The two later visit an isolated lodge, which, according to Kusanagi, "no-one visits twice". Kannami asks Kusanagi if the Yudagawa's story of Kusanagi killing Jinro is true, to which Kusanagi asks if Kannami "wants to be killed as well".  During a later sortie, Yudagawa and Kannami spot several Lautern bombers with fighter escorts. Rushing ahead to engage the enemy alone, Yudagawa is shot down by a J2 Skyly with a black jaguar painted on the side, the insignia of the Lautern ace known as "The Teacher". Discussing the matter with Tokino and Yuri, Kannami hears the rumour that the Teacher is not a Kildren, but a normal adult. Kusanagi orders all the remaining pilots sortie to hunt down the Teacher, taking Kannami's plane personally. Later, Tokino and Yuri return without Kusanagi, who rushed off alone after spotting the Teacher. Kannami's crashed Sanka is later found by Fūko, and the injured Kusanagi is brought back to base for treatment. Fūko reveals that Kusanagi once visited one of her clients, and had sex with him. Kannami asks Sasakura about Mizuki, but is, as always, unwilling to part with information easily.  The pilots are called to March-Hare base in preparation for a major Rostock operation against one of Lautern's major bases. Tokino and Kannami meet with Midori Mitsuya, March-Hare's ace pilot, who seeks out Kannami, having heard about his reputation. The pilots are briefed on the large operation, and are placed on escort for the fifty bombers. The collective pilots sortie, March-Hare's twin-engined heavy fighters pooled together with 262's Sanka-B's.  The operation commences, with Rostock's fighters refueling in mid-air. The pilots engage Lautern's fighters, but despite their best efforts, the Rostock forces lose several of their heavy bombers. The fighters are ordered to retreat and return to base, albeit without Yuri. 262 Squadron is reinforced by March-Hare's remaining pilots and their machines, Midori among them. During a debriefing session, Midori reports on the loss of two of March-Hare's pilots, describing the Teacher's aircraft and the exact way the Teacher shot them down at point-blank range.  Later that evening, Tokino, Kannami and Kusanagi go bowling together. After Tokino leaves, Kannami asks Kusanagi about the day she was shot down, and inquires as to her relation to the Teacher. Kusanagi reveals that the Teacher was not only once a member of Rostock, but her former superior officer. Kusanagi contemplates the nature of war, and how the perpetual existence of war mandates an undefeatable enemy, which exists in the form of the Teacher. Later, a heavily intoxicated Kusanagi puts a gun to Kannami's head before asking him to kill her, lest "nothing change" for them.  The pilots return to 262's base with the new March-Hare additions. Midori inquires about Mizuki, while Kannami encounters a new pilot, Aihara, who is a dead ringer for the late Yudagawa, right down to folding his newspaper in the same fashion. The base personnel settle into their familiar routines, while Midori begins to search for answers about Kusanagi. Sasakura reveals that Kusanagi, as such a skilled pilot, was one of the few Kildren who survived long enough to question their existence, while Midori expresses her lack of understanding of how the base personnel can be so complacent with the state of affairs.  Midori visits Kannami, questioning Kannami's memories and how he copes with his life. Theorising that Kannami copes by blurring his memories with the present, falling into an endless repetition of now. Midori reveals the nature of the Kildren's conception: they are an accidental by-product of Rostock's experiments with genetics, and as a result, they do not age, and cannot die unless killed. Midori suffers a nervous breakdown, questioning her own memories, wondering if she, too, is a Kildren, and crying about how she cannot recall anything of her childhood, questioning if she ever had one. She continues, revealing her conclusions: Kusanagi shot Jinro to end the perpetual repetition of the life of a Kildren, but he didn't die: he simply became Kannami, implanted with new memories to maintain his skills as a pilot.  Later that evening, Midori tries to shoot Kusanagi. Kannami, intervening at the sound of Midori's gunshot, proposes that he shoot Kusanagi, which appears to her as a "fine idea". As Kannami disarms Midori, she leaves, revealing that Kusanagi had Midori under her own gun the whole time. Kusanagi admits to killing Jinro on his own request, before asking Kannami to shoot her in turn. Kannami refuses to shoot Kusanagi, insisting that she must continue to live until she can change things.  The pilots leave on sortie, flying a patrol as Kannami contemplates how one can find new experiences even if one has travelled the same path before, and regains his memories as Jinro. Midori sights the Teacher's J2 Skyly, and Kannami engages the Lautern ace alone, resolving to "kill his father". After a brief dogfight, the Teacher executes his unique maneuver against Kannami's Sanka-B, and Kannami is killed in action. One by one, the base personnel accept that Kannami is not coming back.  Isamu Hiragi, Kannami's replacement, arrives at 262. His face is not seen, but his physical mannerisms in exiting his plane are identical to Kannami's, as is his lighting a cigarette, and the tone of his voice. As Sasakura looks on impassively from the hangar, as if she'd seen the scene play out many times before, the viewer is given a final strong hint that the Kildren may all be clones. Hiragi is greeted by Kusanagi in a much warmer fashion, telling him that she's "been waiting for him to arrive".  === Aircraft ===  Rostock * Sanka Mk.B: Standard fighter of Rostock Iron Works.

Smart People
 [[Carnegie Mellon]] [[English Studies|English]] Professor Lawrence Wetherhold (Dennis Quaid) is a widowed parent of his alienated college son, James (Ashton Holmes), overachieving high school daughter, Vanessa (Ellen Page), and sibling to his adopted ne'er-do-well brother, Chuck (Thomas Haden Church) that he cannot evade enough. The professor is bitter, arrogant, self-absorbed and uninterested in his students; this does not help him when he parks illegally on campus, his car is impounded and does not pay his fine before getting to the college impound lot watched by a flunked former student.  Lawrence suffers a trauma-induced seizure after falling from the top of a fence in an attempt to retrieve his briefcase from inside his impounded car. In the emergency room, he is treated by Dr. Janet Hartigan (Parker), a former student he does not remember. Lawrence has to figure out a way to get about without being able to operate his car; Chuck is without a place to sleep and a job so Vanessa sets things up for what he characterizes as a "win/win" situation.  Lawrence goes to the hospital for a follow-up, where another doctor tells him Janet had been his student. He meets Janet again outside the hospital as he is leaving and, since Chuck has failed to show up, she offers to take him home. When they arrive, he asks Janet to join him for a "face-to-face conversation." She agrees, fulfilling her old student crush on the professor. Vanessa is not pleased, confronting Janet about Lawrence's fragility. At dinner, Lawrence monopolizes the conversation and Janet walks out. Lawrence fakes a visit to the emergency room to see Janet again and the two reconcile for a second date. They get back to Janet's place where they have sex, but while spending the night, Janet is turned off by Lawrence's neediness and worries that he is, in fact, still too distraught by his wife's death. To get rid of him, she feigns being called in by the hospital and does not return any of his subsequent calls. On another night, in the midst of a contentious family Christmas dinner at the Wetherholds', Janet arrives unannounced with a cake.  After Chuck gets Vanessa drunk to celebrate her early acceptance into [[Stanford University]], she makes a pass at him, which he rejects.  He then moves in part-time with Lawrence's son, James ([[Ashton Holmes]]), in his college dormitory.  James' girlfriend, Missy ([[Camille Mana]]), who is one of his father's students, tells Lawrence that James has had a poem accepted by ''[[The New Yorker]]''. In contrast, Lawrence's latest academic tome has been universally rejected. After Vanessa suggests a new title, ''You Can't Read!'', the book is sold to [[Penguin Group]], a large non-academic publisher in [[New York City|New York]]. To Lawrence's dismay, however, the book is largely re-worked and edited by the publisher and only vaguely resembles his original work. Janet accompanies Lawrence on a trip to New York to meet with the publisher, where she learns she is pregnant with his child. Finding him preoccupied by his book's publishing and an ongoing campaign to become chairman of the English Department, Janet is again upset by Lawrence's self-absorption and breaks up with him without telling him the news.  Back in Pittsburgh, Lawrence is confronted by both James and Chuck, who both point to his apparent lack of interest in his children's lives. Encouraged by Chuck, Lawrence goes to the hospital to reconcile with Janet, who reveals her pregnancy. He has meanwhile dropped his bid to become department head and has become a more involved parent and professor.  During the end credits, Lawrence and Janet cradle twin babies: one boy and one girl.  
Snow Buddies
 Air Bud's five [[Golden Retriever]] puppies known as the Buddies from [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] are having fun with their new owners before they go to school. The puppies meet up in the park and decide to play hide and seek. Budderball sees an ice cream truck and decides to go in, forcing the others to try and rescue him. However, the Buddies become trapped in a truck heading to Ferntiuktuk, [[Alaska]]. Upon arrival, the Buddies meet Shasta, a [[Siberian Husky]] puppy whose 11-year-old owner is determined to win the Alaskan sled dog race because of what happened to his father. The puppies decide to help Shasta pursue his dreams as well as get to the air port, located at the finish line. Unfortunately, as Shasta has no parents, this puts the puppies in a predicament as there is nobody to teach them how to become snow dogs. Shasta manages to persuade a legendary dog named Talon, who had taught Shasta's father, into teaching the puppies into becoming his new [[protégé]]s.  When Shasta introduces his owner, Adam, to his new sleigh team, the child is delighted at the prospect of his dreams coming true and the team pursue vigorous training routines. Adam begins building a new sleigh with his team of hard-working puppies. Talon proudly watches as the team's efforts come to fruition and it seems as though they are cooperating as a team. The older town huskies, however, are not impressed and begin to plan their downfall. They reveal to the Buddies that Shasta's parents were killed in a dog sled race last year when the ice beneath them shattered to dishearten them. They perished on that fateful day.  Talon calls the puppies to the mountain lake one night to view the [[aurora borealis|Northern Lights]] before he goes of telling Shasta that he knows all he needs to know and that he can become the great leader that his father was. The following morning, the puppies enter the race with Adam. But everyone else laughs at the thought of a boy and puppies entering a race. The [[sheriff]] goes over the rules and sees Adam wrote his own name in the entry list. After being reminded how treacherous the race is by the sheriff, the puppies begin their trek while Jean George, last year's champion, cheats by sabotaging the other racer's sled or pushing them off their sled. Soon only young Adam and Jean George are left but news of a terrible blizzard arrives and it's too late to call off the race as the racers have already gotten past the midway checkpoint.  Meanwhile, the puppies' parents, Buddy and Molly follow the puppies to Alaska, after being tipped by Mrs. Mittens, where the [[St. Bernard (dog)|Saint Bernard]] dog Bernie informs them of their participation in the race. Sheriff Ryan gets a message sent by Fernfield's Deputy Dan asking for any information on the Buddies. The Sheriff phones Deputy Dan to inform him that the Buddies are in Alaska. A dangerous blizzard forces Adam and the team take shelter in an [[igloo]] provided by an [[Inuit]] until the storm subsides. They come head to head with their opponent, Jean George, and Adam gets injured.  Adam then recovers while Jean George's dogs get into trouble when the ice beneath them shatters. Jean George continues and abandons his dogs while Adam and the puppies begin a rescue operation despite Shasta's fears of his parents' death. The puppies pull the dogs out of the icy waters and Jean George continues the race without any gratitude and abandons their rescuers. Jean George's dogs realise they owe nothing to their owner and everything to Shasta and the Buddies, and so, slow down and "go on strike" causing Jean George to lose the race.  Adam is victorious and the Buddies reunite with Buddy and Molly. Jean George gives out to his dogs and they respond in kind by chasing him around the Arctic. The Buddies sadly say goodbye to their new best friend, Shasta, as well as Adam. All seven Buddies return home via air plane and are greeted by their owners: Sam, Bartleby, Billy, Alice, Pete, Henry and Noah who were waiting for them. Budderball and his owner, Bartleby, are watching the news the next day and Bartleby is surprised when he watches the part about the Buddies, Adam and Shasta winning the race. Buddy and Molly discuss their pups accomplishments, while wondering if there'll ever outgrow exploring. The film ends with a bigger Shasta and Adam racing in Alaska with a new pack of huskies and Talon reminding the audience "to always have faith".  
Slumdog Millionaire
 18-year-old [[Jamal Malik (character)|Jamal Malik]], an Indian Muslim from the [[Dharavi]] [[slum]], is a contestant on the [[Kaun Banega Crorepati|Indian version of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]], and is one question away from the grand prize. However, before the  question, he is detained and tortured by the police, who suspect him of cheating because of the impossibility of a simple "slumdog" with very little education knowing all the answers. Jamal recounts, through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], the incidents in his life which provided him with each answer.  Jamal's flashbacks begin with his managing, at age five, to obtain the autograph of [[Bollywood]] star [[Amitabh Bachchan]], where he had to jump into a toilet cesspit  when his brother Salim blocked the door, who later sells the autograph, followed immediately by the death of his mother during the [[Bombay riots]]. As they flee the riot, the brothers meet Latika, a girl from their slum. Salim is reluctant to take her in, but Jamal suggests that she could be the "third musketeer", a character from the [[Alexandre Dumas]] novel ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' (which they had been studying—albeit not very diligently—in school), whose name they do not know.  The three are found by Mamana [[Organised crime in India|gangster]] who [[Child trafficking in India|tricks and then trains street children]] into becoming [[Begging|beggars]]. When Salim discovers Maman is blinding the children in order to make them more effective beggars, he flees with Jamal and Latika to a departing train. Latika fails to board the train as Salim purposefully lets go of her hand, in revenge for an extremely embarrassing prank that Latika had played on Salim. This resulted in her being recaptured by Maman. Over the next few years, Salim and Jamal make a living travelling on top of trains, selling goods, [[Pickpocketing|picking pockets]], working as dish washers, and pretending to be tour guides at the [[Taj Mahal]], where they also steal people's shoes. At Jamal's insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika, discovering that she is being raised by Maman to be a prostitute, soon to fetch him a high price as a [[virginity|virgin]]. The brothers rescue her, and while escaping Maman they shoot him to death. Salim then manages to get a job with JavedMaman's rival crime lord. Back at their room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him and Latika alone. When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him, whereas Latika persuades Jamal to obey his brother and go away.  Years later, Jamal, now a [[Chaiwala]] in an Indian [[call centre]], searches the centre's database for Salim and Latika. He fails in finding Latika, while succeeding in finding Salim, now a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's crime organisation. Jamal reproaches Salim, who then pleads for forgiveness, and offers him to stay in his luxurious apartment. Jamal later bluffs his way into Javed's residence to reunite with Latika but as he professes his love for her, Latika asks him to forget about her. Jamal nevertheless promises to wait for her every day at five o'clock at the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station|VT]] station. Latika attempts to meet him there, but is recaptured by Javed's men, led by Salim, and once Javed moves to another house, outside Mumbai, the two again lose contact. Jamal becomes a contestant on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'', knowing that she watches the show regularly. Much to the consternation of Prem Kumar, the show's host, Jamal becomes a wonder across India. During a break before Jamal answers the penultimate question, Kumar tries to fool him by feeding him the wrong answer whilst in the [[Public toilet|men's room]].  After the break Jamal uses the [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?#Lifelines|50/50 lifeline]], leaving Kumar's answer and one other, but chooses the other one.  The episode ends before the final question can be asked, and Kumar leads Jamal out of the studio where he is immediately forced into a police van. After an initial [[Battery (crime)|beating]], the police inspector listens to Jamal's explanation of how he reached each answer. Finding all of them "bizarrely plausible", he allows him back on the show. At Javed's [[Safe house|safehouse]], Latika sees Jamal on the news and Salim, in an effort to make amends for his past behaviour, gives Latika his mobile phone and car keys, and asks her to forgive him and to go to Jamal. Latika is reluctant out of fear of Javed, but agrees and escapes. Salim fills a bathtub with money and sits in it, awaiting for Javed and his men as they realize that he let Latika free. Jamal's final question is the name of the third musketeer in ''The Three Musketeers'', which he never learned. Jamal uses his "Phone-A-Friend" lifeline to call Salim's 'phone, as it is the only phone number he knows. Latika answers the phone, and, while she does not know the answer, tells Jamal that she is safe. Relieved, Jamal arbitrarily picks [[Aramis]], the right answer, and wins the grand prize. Javed hears Latika on the show and realises that Salim has betrayed him. He and his men break down the bathroom door but Salim kills Javed before he is shot, gasping, "[[Takbir|God is great]]". Soon thereafter, Jamal and Latika meet on the platform at the railway station and they kiss.  
Snow (2008 film)
 The movie takes place in autumn 1997, in the small [[Bosniak]] village of Slavno, in central Bosnia. Only the women and girls are left, along with an old grandfather and a little boy. All of the men have disappeared on account of the [[Bosnian war]].  The most entrepreneurial of the women, Alma, a young widow, attempts to help the families survive by producing plum [[fruit preserves|jam]] and [[pastries]], but the village is too far away from the market to have any customers. Accidentally, she and another women meet a truck-driver from [[Zvornik]], named Hamza, who offers to carry the goods to the market for them on the following Wednesday. However, he does not show up as agreed.

Solstice (film)
  Megan (Harnois) has been distraught since her twin sister Sophie (Harnois) committed suicide a few months ago. When it comes time for the annual summer solstice trip to a lake house in the bayous of Louisiana with her friends, Megan reluctantly decides to go. Once the five friends arrive, Megan soon begins to suspect that her dead sister is trying to communicate with her as the solstice—the time when our world and the next are closest—approaches. She sees numerous shadow-like figures, mud runs from all the taps, and Megan is "followed" by Sophie's key chain that she keeps getting rid of. Whenever the shadow figure appears, or Megan has a nightmare, the key chain appears.  Megan, on advice from Nick, goes outside, wraps a white cloth around the key chain and buries it, which should expel the spirit. She goes for a bath, but mud runs from the tap and the spirit appears. After it disappears again, the key chain is lying on the floor.  Megan goes running, but she trips over a hole in the ground, and cracks her nail (which she had foreseen in several nightmares). As she limps back to the road, she meets Leonard again. Inside his van, she sees a hat identical to Sophie's. The next day, the day of the solstice, after recovering from her fall, she walks down to Leonard's house. She finds farming equipment and several large knives.  Inside the house, she looks around, and finds a young girl's bedroom. On the cabinet, Megan notices a cutting from a newspaper regarding Malin, a young girl who disappeared the year before. Leonard arrives home, and Megan has to jump out of the girl's window to escape.  Back at the lake house, Nick comes for dinner on the night before the solstice. Megan tells him about the chain and what she believes is Sophie's ghost. All six of the friends go into the lake in their underwear and Nick calls forth the spirit with wine, which then drags Megan under the water. As her friends try to get her out, she sees more visions. They all get out of the lake afterwards.  Megan realizes that the ghost is not that of Sophie, but Malin, and she takes Nick to the ruins she encountered earlier, when she fell over. The other friends all follow, including Christian with a gun. Nick and Megan get split up, and Christian almost shoots Nick. Megan then digs up Malin's body, and finds that the key on the key chain is for Malin's bicycle, which was buried with her.  They then call the police.  Christian then admits that the year before, when they all came to the lake house, including Sophie, he and Sophie were going for a drive and hit Malin. Not wanting to be arrested, they buried her in the forest. Sophie then committed suicide as she could not bear the guilt. Malin's ghost appears, and Christian runs away towards the road. Megan chases him through the forest, but before she can reach him, he gets to the road and is hit by the police car that had been called out. The ending shows Megan at Malin's grave. When Leonard arrives home, he finds Malin's key chain on the porch, put there by Megan. Megan and Nick decide to go to the city together.

 Ham III, grandson of the [[Ham the Chimp|first chimpanzee in space]], is a [[Human cannonball|cannonball]] at his circus, which his grandfather's friend Houston criticizes. Meanwhile, an unmanned [[NASA]] space probe called the ''Infinity'' is dragged into an intergalactic [[wormhole]] and crash-lands on an Earth-like planet on the other side of the galaxy. Zartog, an evil-minded inhabitant, accidentally discovers how to take manual control of the on-board machinery and uses it to enslave the population.  Faced with the loss of the probe and probable loss of their budget, the scientists have to find a way to regain contact with the probe, to help retrieve the wayward craft. Technical genius chimp Comet gets the scientists to pick them as astronauts to explore the planet and get the probe back, with the help of the fearless Lt. Luna, and their bombastic commander, Titan. The Senator likes the idea, but wants something extra special to grab the attention of the media, and picks Ham. Ham is uninterested in the mission, but he is launched into space despite his best efforts to escape the scientist's training facility.  The three chimps enter the wormhole, where Titan and Luna pass out from the pressure, leaving Ham with the task of getting the ship out and landing it. This is done, and Ham and Luna explore the planet, during which their ship, along with Titan, is taken by a group of aliens sent by Zartog. Ham and Luna begin their journey to Zartog's palace, and on the way they meet one of the inhabitants, known to them as Kilowatt.

They rescue him and are able to board their ship, but just as they are about to leave, Ham glances outside and sees Zartog torturing some of the other aliens. He then tells Titan and Luna that they indirectly sent the probe there, and that they owe it to Kilowatt to help save the planet. The three of them exit the ship, which blasts off set to autopilot, but as they are trying to think of a plan, Zartog attacks them with the probe. Just as they are about to get destroyed, Titan tricks Zartog into triggering an ejection mechanism in the probe, which in turn leads to his defeat.  The chimps then discover that Kilowatt has survived, and they are able to make contact with Comet and Houston back on Earth through a walkie-talkie. Houston reminds them that if they can redesign the probe, then they can use it to get back to Earth. They manage to do this with help from the planet's inhabitants and they use an erupting volcano to get the thrust they need to escape the planet's gravity. They go into space, and just as they are about to re-enter the wormhole, Titan hands the controls over to Ham, since Ham is the only one who can withstand the pressure, and thus, the only one who can pilot the ship home. Titan and Luna once again pass out. Ham is unsure if he is up to the task until he has a mental conversation with his grandfather, who tells him to believe in himself and to just do things his (Ham's) way.  Ham manages to manoeuver the ship back to Earth and land it with Luna's help, and the Senator, under pressure from the press, decides to dramatically increase the space program's funding.

When Jared uncovers a [[dumbwaiter (elevator)|dumbwaiter]] system behind a wall, he finds a monogrammed key and discovers the study of the late owner of the estate, Arthur Spiderwick ([[David Strathairn]]). Jared then uses the key to open a chest. In it, he finds Spiderwick's field guide to fairies; although an attached note warns him not to read it, he does so anyway. When Jared explains about his discovery on the existence of magical creatures, Helen and Mallory don't believe him.  Soon after, Jared meets a [[brownie (mythology)|brownie]] named Thimbletack ([[Martin Short]]), who explains that magical creatures are normally invisible, but can reveal themselves at will. He tells Jared about a protective circle that Arthur Spiderwick placed around the house and gives him a stone with a hole through which he can see fairies.  A [[shape-shifting|shapeshifting]] [[ogre]] named Mulgarath ([[Nick Nolte]]) wants the field guide for himself so he can rule over all fairy-kind. He sends his goblins, led by Redcap (an uncredited [[Ron Perlman]]) the pompous Goblin General, to obtain it and they kidnap Simon, mistaking him for Jared. Meanwhile, Jared meets Hogsqueal ([[Seth Rogen]]), a [[hobgoblin]] and bitter enemy of Mulgarath because Mulgarath killed his entire family. Hogsqueal gives Jared the ability to see fairies without the aid of the stone by spitting in his eyes. Mulgarath lets Simon go and berates Redcap for failing his master. Jared finds Simon and both fight over the book, which is spotted by the goblins. Together, the twins flee to the house, though Simon is injured when one bites his leg. Mallory is then attacked by the goblins, but manages to kill several using her fencing skills, making her finally realize that Jared is right. Inside, Thimbletack informs them that Mulgarath will kill all humans and fairies who oppose him if he gets the book.  They resolve to destroy the book by cremating it in a fire, but the flames do not harm it due to a protective spell placed upon it. With no other options, the children decide to visit their great-aunt Lucinda, now in a [[psychiatric hospital]], for advice. While Simon distracts the goblins, Mallory and Jared manage to reach a tunnel under the estate. They are pursued by a mole troll and only narrowly escape it when it is struck by an oncoming vehicle. It is revealed that Arthur Spiderwick is Lucinda’s father. Lucinda tells them that they need to find him and have him destroy the book. However, Arthur is being held captive by [[Sylph]]s, a type of fairie, since Lucinda was 6. Suddenly, Mulgarath's goblins attack them and steal several pages from the book before they are driven off. In the woods, Mulgarath violently berates Redcap for not bringing all of the book, as most of the information in the stolen pages were useless, but he is pleased by when he discovers that one of them has information that tells them how to break the protective circle by moonrise. Mulgarath and Redcap prepare to make the potion for the upcoming night. Meanwhile, Helen, who drives Jared and Mallory home, doesn't believe them on what's going on and accuses them of using that as an excuse for wanting to go back to New York. Jared then gets in a heated argument with her on why his father left her because of her not listening and starts yelling. Once home, Jared tells Helen he hates her and doesn't want to live with her. Later, Hogsqueal warns Jared, Simon, and Mallory about Mulgarath's plan and gives Simon and Mallory the ability to see fairies. Jared then tries to call his father, but Mallory tells him he has moved in with another woman and will not return to them as he promised, bringing Jared to tears.  Jared, Simon, and Mallory use the book to summon Arthur Spiderwick's pet, a [[griffin]], which takes them to the realm of the Sylphs. There they meet Arthur, who has not aged but is also unaware of the time he has spent there. The children ask him to destroy the book only to find that Thimbletack had switched the pages. He also informs them that the Sylphs won't allow them to leave as they'll be held captive like he is, but helps them escape by distracting them. Once home, they try to convince Helen of the imminent threat of the goblins and the existence of magical creatures. At first, Helen refuses to listen until Thimbletack appears and they show her the goblins outside, finally shattering her disbelief and making her agree to help stop the attack. At this time, the goblins have finished spreading the potion, which successfully breaks the circle when the moon rises. Jared, Simon, Mallory, and Helen arm themselves with steel knives and home-made tomato sauce/salt bombs prepared by Simon earlier. The family successfully fend off the attacking goblins, though the house suffers considerable damage in the process. When they are forced into the kitchen by Mulgarath's arrival, they place all of their bombs into the oven, detonating them and killing all of the goblins, including Redcap.  Richard ([[Andrew McCarthy]]) enters the house and tells Jared that he came to apologize. Jared, realizing that it is not his father, stabs him in the stomach, revealing him to be Mulgarath in disguise. Jared escapes with the book through the dumbwaiter while Mulgarath gives pursuit in snake form and injures Thimbletack. On the roof, Jared throws the book into the air; Mulgarath transforms into a raven and catches it, but he is snatched and eaten by Hogsqueal, avenging his family and the scattered pages fall on the ground. Jared then climbs down the roof and he and Helen reconcile for their arguments earlier and for the latter to apologize for not believing him. Hogsqueal and the Graces pick up the scattered pages of the Field Guide.  The Graces bring Lucinda back to the house, showing her the repairs being made to the house in the aftermath of the goblin attack and reintroducing her to Thimbletack, who is alive. Suddenly, the Sylphs appear, bringing Arthur, as he was allowed to visit his home since the book was now safe. He cannot remain outside of the fairie realm, or he will turn to dust. Lucinda asks to be taken with him instead; the Sylphs transform her back into her six-year-old self and spirit the two away as the Graces watch and then resume their normal lives with Thimbletack, Hogsqueal, and the Griffin.

Sand and her husband Mahmoud ([[Eric Balfour]]) had earlier fled with chests they recovered from the water. Shot at, Sand escaped, leaving one chest behind which was retrieved by Octopus. The Octopus kills Liebowitz, and his cloned henchmen attack the Spirit. His accomplice [[Silken Floss]] ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) flees with the chest as the two arch-nemeses fight.  The next morning, the Spirit is awakened by his lover, [[Dr. Ellen Dolan]] ([[Sarah Paulson]]), daughter of Commissioner Eustace Dolan ([[Dan Lauria]]). He is undeterred by his gunshot wounds. He notices a gold locket in Sussman's hand, which had been torn from Sand Saref's neck. The locket contains pictures of a much-younger Colt and Sand, and had been his gift to her. Sand had become disenchanted with the city's corruption following the death of her father, a police officer, and left for fifteen years. In a secret lair, the Octopus and Silken Floss discover their chest contains the [[Golden Fleece]], not the Blood of Heracles, as expected. Sand and Mahmoud visit an underworld figure who sold them the location of the treasure, and it is implied he gave the location to the Octopus.  Having fully regenerated, Commissioner Dolan calls The Spirit away to a case and relates Sand's history as one of the world's great jewel thieves. While arresting her, he reveals he knows she is looking for the Golden Fleece, and she shoves him through a window, which he survives. The Spirit receives a tip on the location of the Octopus's lair but is captured while investigating. The Octopus reveals that his and Floss's experimentation led to the creation of an immortality serum. The Octopus first tested it on Colt's dead body; Colt came back to life and earned the ire of [[Death (personification)|Death]] for escaping her clutches. Eventually, the Octopus injected himself with the serum, but he needs the blood of [[Hercules|Heracles]], a demi-god, to perfect the formula. The Spirit escapes by seducing assassin Plaster of Paris ([[Paz Vega]]), who as a parting gift turns on The Octopus. When the Spirit mentions Sand's name, she stabs him out of spite.  After recovering, the Spirit stumbles to the city docks and collapses into the water, where the Lorelei ([[Jaime King]]), the Angel of Death, confronts him. He initially submits but changes his mind after remembering the women he has known. As he swims to the surface, she vows to have him. At the projects, Sand, Floss, and their henchmen meet to exchange the Blood of Heracles for the Golden Fleece. Sand attempts to convince Floss to leave the Octopus before he kills her. Floss gains the upper hand and the Octopus asks Floss for the vase of blood. As the Spirit suddenly materializes, Floss drives off, unable to take a side.  The Octopus shoots a series of progressively larger guns at the Spirit, apparently killing him, but Dolan's [[SWAT]] team storms the area and opens fire. The Octopus is maimed; as he desperately tries to drink the Blood of Heracles, Sand shoots the vase. The Spirit rises, shown to be wearing a bullet-proof vest, and blows up the Octopus with a grenade while Sand uses the Golden Fleece to protect them from the explosion.  The Spirit gives Sand her locket back. They kiss as Ellen looks on, feeling betrayed. The old flames bid each other goodbye and the Spirit convinces Dolan to let Sand go in gratitude for saving him and the world. Nearby, Floss discovers one of the Octopus's severed fingers crawling towards her; she picks it up and departs with two of the clones. Meanwhile, the Spirit and Ellen make amends and embrace.  
Speed Racer (film)
 Speed Racer is an 18-year-old whose life and love has always been automobile racing. His parents Pops and Mom run the independent Racer Motors, in which his brother Spritle and his pet monkey Chim Chim, his mechanic Sparky and his girlfriend Trixie are also involved. As a child Speed idolized his record-setting older brother, Rex Racer, who was apparently killed while racing in the Casa Cristo 5000 (AKA The Crucible) a deadly cross-country [[rallying|racing rally]]. Now embarking on his own career, Speed is quickly sweeping the racing world with his skill behind the wheel of his brother's [[Mach 5]] and his own T-180 car the Mach 6, although primarily interested in the art of the race and the well-being of his family.  E.P. Arnold Royalton, owner of conglomerate Royalton Industries, offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle in exchange for signing to race with him. Though tempted, Speed declines due to his father's distrust of power-hungry corporations. Angered, Royalton reveals that for many years, key races have been [[match fixing|fixed]] by corporate interests, including himself, to gain profits. Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a crash that destroys the Mach 6 and suing Racer Motors for [[intellectual property infringement]]. Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector, head of an intelligence agency's corporate crimes division. Racer Taejo Togokahn supposedly has evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the mysterious masked [[Racer X (Speed Racer character)|Racer X]] agree to race on his team in the Casa Cristo 5000, which could also substantially raise the stock price of his family's racing business, blocking a Royalton-arranged buyout. Speed agrees but keeps his decision secret from his family, and Detector's team makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the rally.  After they drive together and work naturally as a team, Speed begins to suspect that Racer X is actually his brother Rex in disguise. His family discovers that he has entered the race and agree to support him. With the help of his family and Trixie, Speed defeats many brutal racers, who were bribed by fixer Cruncher Block to stop him, and overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles to win the race, while Detector's team arrests Block. However, Taejo's arrangement is revealed to be a sham, as he was only interested in increasing the value of his family's company to profit from Royalton's buyout. Enraged, Speed hits the track that he used to drive with his brother, and confronts Racer X with his suspicion that he is Rex. Racer X removes his mask, revealing an unfamiliar face, and tells Speed that Rex is indeed dead. Speed returns home, where Taejo's sister Horuko gives him Taejo's rejected automatic invitation to the Grand Prix. The Racer family bands together and builds a new Mach 6 in 32 hours.  Speed enters the Grand Prix against great odds; Royalton has placed a $1,000,000 bounty on his head that the other drivers are eager to collect, and he is pitted against future Hall of Fame driver Jack "Cannonball" Taylor. Speed overcomes a slow start to catch up with Taylor, who uses a cheating device called a spearhook to latch the Mach 6 to his own car. Speed uses his jump jacks to expose the device to video cameras, causing Taylor to crash. Speed wins the race, having successfully exposed Royalton's crimes. While Racer X watches it is revealed in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] that he really is Rex, who has faked his death and undergone [[plastic surgery]] to change his appearance as part of his plan to protect Speed and the sport of racing. He chooses not to reveal his identity to his family, declaring that he must live with his decision. The Racer family celebrates Speed's victory as Speed and Trixie kiss, and Royalton is sent to jail.  
Splinter (2008 film)
 The film opens on a sleepy gas station, where the slack-jawed pump attendant (Charles Baker) is attacked by a seemingly rabid animal. Through a series of glimpses the attendant's body begins to contort after the attack. Meanwhile, a young couple, Seth Belzer ([[Paulo Costanzo]]) and Polly Watt ([[Jill Wagner]]), retreat to the wilderness for a romantic camping trip in the ancient forests of Oklahoma, but their plans are shattered when they are car-jacked by an escaped convict, Dennis Farell ([[Shea Whigham]]), and his drug-addict girlfriend, Lacey Belisle (Rachel Kerbs). As the foursome travel the back roads together, they get a flat tire when they run over a small splinter infected animal on the road. They eventually find shelter at the now abandoned gas station.  Soon after their arrival at the gas station, Lacey discovers the infected still-living body of the attendant from the opening scene. Lacey is attacked and dies almost immediately, but her corpse slowly reanimates and becomes a new creature, which attacks the remaining survivors. While fighting this creature, Seth, Polly and Dennis discover that severed pieces of the infected victims are capable of attacking on their own. Later on, Sheriff Terry Frankel (Laurel Whitsett) arrives on the scene and attempts to arrest Dennis, but she is ripped in half by Lacey's corpse. The creature takes the top half of the officer's body to the roof and slowly bonds with it, creating a larger creature. Seth formulates a plan to call for help using the cop's radio left behind when her body was ripped in half. However, during the execution of this plan, the newly rebuilt creature attacks and takes the lower half of the cop. The trio hides in the gas station's walk-in refrigerator when a section of its arm manages to get in and attack them. It is then discovered that Dennis has been infected, as his left arm violently twists and twitches on its own. Seth and Polly amputate his arm to prevent the infection from spreading. Dennis later explains that he had been pricked by a splinter from the dead creature they encountered on the road. Seth also discovers that the creatures are actually just a mold or fungus taking control of the corpses they infect and consuming the blood, and, because it is a simple creature, they hunt based on temperature, attacking the warmest thing they can find.  By lowering his body temperature with bags of ice, Seth is able to sneak past the creature to the police car, while Polly and Farell distract it with fireworks. Seth makes it to the police car, but discovers that, without the keys, the car, and the police radio inside, are useless. Meanwhile, Seth's body temperature has risen, forcing Dennis to leave the gas station in order to lure the creature away from him. As a result, the creature manages to enter the gas station and Dennis and Polly are forced to hide in the freezer. Meanwhile, the discarded fireworks ignite the trail of flammable liquid left earlier and the gas station catches on fire. Seth is able to retrieve a shotgun from the police car and helps Polly and Dennis escape. Dennis offers to keep the creature at bay while Seth and Polly escape, and is infected in the process. He shoots one of the gas pumps with the shotgun and the creature is engulfed in flames. When the smoke clears, the creature is dead, but Dennis is still infected. Seth and Polly approach Dennis, who gives them a key to a bank account, telling them to give it to the wife of a man he shot and paralyzed who later died. Dennis shoots directly into a stack of propane tanks, incinerating himself, the gas station, and any remaining infected corpses.  Seth and Polly walk off into the sunrise, but the final scene reveals that there are other infected creature corpses lying dormant in the woods.  
Speedy Delivery
 ''Speedy Delivery'' follows David Newell/Mr. McFeely around his own neighborhood, [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], examining the two roles he has played for over forty years. Intercut with retrospective interviews, the film explores David Newell's life of service, as both playing the character Mr. McFeely and as director of public relations for [[Family Communications, Inc.]], the parent company founded by Fred Rogers.<ref>[http://www.fci.org/viewcontent.asp?sectionID=3&subsectionID={C4741AE9-B471-40AE-B594-E7BFE5A26C5B}&subsubsectionID={5B10796F-A045-46F3-A004-06DDCB1AE875}]</ref> This company created and produced ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' during the majority of its years on air since its debut in 1967.<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/R/htmlR/rogersfred/rogersfred.htm]</ref>  The film follows David Newell on four appearances located in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Beginning in Pittsburgh, he appears at the opening of the Schenley Plaza Carousel, meeting and greeting with fans. Next, he travels to [[Baltimore, Maryland]] to help open up a special [[Mister Rogers]] traveling exhibit, including a replica of the set. Finally, he returns to Pittsburgh for two more appearances in [[Bridgeville, Pennsylvania]] and Cranberry Park. All along the way, the film uses retrospective interviews with former cast members and current co-workers to discuss topics like Newell's childhood, the passing of Fred Rogers, where the character Mr. McFeely came from and what kept ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' successful and authentic for over four decades.  
The Square (2008 film)
 Raymond Yale ([[David Roberts (Australian actor)|David Roberts]]) and Carla Smith ([[Claire van der Boom]]) are lovers in a small Australian town living across the river from one another. However, both are already married; Raymond to a loveless wife and Carla to a domineering petty gangster Greg "Smithy" Smith ([[Anthony Hayes (actor)|Anthony Hayes]]). Ray and Carla plan to leave their respective spouses and run away together, although Ray insists that they delay until he has enough money to ensure a new life together. As a foreman overseeing the construction of a new leisure resort for property developer Gil Hubbard ([[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]]), Ray has been doing underhanded deals with construction worker Barney ([[Kieran Darcy-Smith]]) for the hefty kick-backs which he hopes will eventually land him enough to run off with Carla.  In the meantime, Ray and Carla are forced to conduct their affair in secret, occasionally made awkward by meeting each other at local events and by Carla's dog periodically escaping and instinctively running to Ray's house to meet his dog. One day, after returning home from work, Carla sees Smithy wiping blood off his hands and stashing a [[money bag|duffel bag full of cash]] into their ceiling; presumably the loot from an armed robbery conducted by Smithy's gang. Carla tells Ray, insisting this to be the end of their financial troubles, and although he is initially hesitant she finally persuades him to steal the money.  Ray devises a plan. He will need to burn the house down so Smithy thinks the money was simply destroyed rather than stolen, a job for which he hires the local arsonist, Billy ([[Joel Edgerton]]). Carla will first steal the money from the hiding place and then Billy will arrive and set a fire to make it look as though it was caused by faulty Christmas tree lights.  While the whole town is at the Christmas celebration, Carla sneaks back to the house and takes the money from the duffel bag. However, on return she overhears Smithy phoning his mother and asking her to go to his house (the one Billy is planning to burn down) and feed his dog. Carla alerts Ray who quickly tries to ring Billy, but is only able to reach his sister Lily ([[Hanna Mangan-Lawrence]]). With his phone dying, Ray tells Lily to abort the plan but Lily is unable to alert Billy before he leaves. Billy breaks in and sets the fire, unaware of Smithy's mum sleeping on the lounge. Consequently, she dies in the ensuing blaze.  Thus things begin to take a downward slide for Ray and Carla. Lily neglects to tell Billy about Ray's call aborting the plan, causing Billy to think he has been duped unwillingly into murdering an old lady. Smithy, devastated by his mother's death, then discovers that the money had, in fact, been stolen, and begins to search ruthlessly for the culprits. And Ray's life is further complicated when someone starts sending him Christmas cards threatening to reveal "what you're up to" unless a $10,000 blackmail is paid. What follows is a quickening spiral of murder, suspicion, violence and deceit with shocking consequences for the two lovers and everyone around them. Every time someone discovers something about Ray, they end up dead in some accident caused by Ray trying to stop them. The blackmailer is discovered to be Barney and his wife (who have been scamming people by providing kick-backs and then blackmailing them). Ray goes to Carla's house so they can run off together only to find Billy. Billy demands the rest of his money and Carla gives him the bag full of money she and Ray were going to run away with. As Billy forces Ray and Carla on their knees, Smithy walks in and pulls a gun on Billy. In the fire exchange Smithy is killed and as Ray tries to take the gun from Billy, Carla is shot in the head. Billy leaves as Ray weeps over Carla's body. Ray walks off down the road in shock from the events.  
Spike (2008 film)
  Through a series of [[dream]]like images, a girl ([[Sarah Livingston Evans]]) and her three friends find themselves stranded in a dark and [[surrealism|surrealistic]] forest by someone — or something ([[Edward Gusts]]) — who has obsessively loved, watched, and waited for the girl ever since childhood.  
Stag Night
 Four men on a bachelor party in New York ride the subway and, along with two strippers from the club, accidentally get off at a station that closed down in the 1970s.  Trapped in the tunnels beneath New York, they witness the murder of a transit cop by three transients and find themselves on the run for their lives.  
Stargate: The Ark of Truth
 While digging on [[Dakara]], [[SG-1]] discovers a box that they believe contains the Ark of Truth, but before they can open it, [[Ori (Stargate)#Ori warriors|Ori soldiers]] arrive, led by Tomin. [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel]] tricks them into opening the box, but it is revealed to be a fake. When Tomin is ordered by a [[Prior (Stargate)|Prior]] to kill them, he refuses, and [[Cameron Mitchell (Stargate)|Mitchell]] kills the Prior, whose powers were being blocked by the Anti-Prior device. Shocked at the death of their Prior, the Ori soldiers surrender with Tomin returning to Earth with SG-1 where he resides at the SGC for a time.  Back on Earth, General [[Hank Landry (Stargate SG-1)|Landry]] and Mitchell meet James Marrick, an [[Tau'ri organizations in Stargate#International Oversight Advisory (IOA)|IOA]] representative sent to interrogate Tomin, because the original IOA representative, Richard Woolsey is now working for the Atlantis Expedition. When Daniel Jackson realizes that the Ark is still in the Ori galaxy, Marrick is assigned to accompany them on board the ''[[List of Earth starships in Stargate#Odyssey|Odyssey]]'' through the [[Supergate (Stargate)|Supergate]]. In the Ori galaxy, a member of the [[Ori (Stargate)#Anti-Ori underground|anti-Ori resistance]] tells the team that according to legend, the Ark is on Celestis, the Ori capital. When SG-1 beams down to the planet, Marrick activates the [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]] computer core which alerts the Ori to the ship's location.  Upon being alerted by Major Kevin Marks of what is going on, Mitchell and [[Samantha Carter|Carter]] beam back to the ''Odyssey'' and discover that Marrick has used the core to build a [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicator]], intending to plant it on an Ori ship and let it spread to their entire fleet. When Mitchell attempts to destroy it with an anti-Replicator Gun, the replicator escapes, and Marrick reveals that the IOA removed that weakness from the design, although conventional weapons are sufficient to destroy individual replicators. Marrick implies that a shutdown code has been included as a failsafe, but claims he does not know what it is. He is placed in the ship's brig and falls victim to the Replicators, who later make their way into the brig, resulting in Merrick becoming a Human/Replicator hybrid. With several Ori ships approaching, Mitchell attempts to beam Daniel, [[Teal'c]], [[Vala Mal Doran|Vala]], and Tomin up from the planet, but the replicator takes over the system and keeps Mitchell from doing so. With no other option, the ''Odyssey'' jumps to hyperspace to escape, leaving the others on the planet.  Daniel finds the Ark in a set of catacombs, and after several ground tremors, brings it to the surface. When the team emerges, they are ambushed by Ori warriors, and Teal'c is shot in the back while the others are captured. When they are brought to the city, Vala discovers that the Ori were indeed killed by the [[Holy Grail|Sangraal]] during the events of ''[[List of Stargate SG-1 episodes#ep208|The Shroud]].'' [[Adria (Stargate)|Adria]] has ascended and taken over all of their power. Teal'c, who has been walking toward the city of Celestis since he was shot, collapses due to his wound within sight of the city. He is subsequently revived by [[Ancient characters in Stargate#Ganos Lal/Morgan le Fay|Morgan le Fay]] and continues on to free Daniel. Morgan then arrives in Daniel's cell (initially in the guise of Merlin) and tells him if he can expose one Prior to the Ark, the others will be turned by a link in their staffs. This will weaken Adria enough for Morgan to stalemate her.  In the meantime, a Prior arrives on Earth, offering a last chance to convert to Origin. When General Landry refuses to even listen to him, the ''[[List of Earth starships in Stargate#Apollo|Apollo]]'' detects a fleet of Ori motherships waiting on the edge of the [[solar system]]. On the ''Odyssey'', Marrick is attacked by Replicators who infest his body.  In the ensuing battle, Mitchell is able to briefly disable the Replicator connection to Marrick's brain, who then informs Mitchell the shut down code for the Replicators is on the other side of the crystal used to create them.  Mitchell activates an explosive charge which kills Marrick.  Mitchell informs Carter, who activates the shut-down command, deactivating the Replicators.  When the Ark is activated and opened, the [[Ori (Stargate)#Doci|Doci]] is caught by the beam and made to see that the Ori are not gods and spreads this belief to all of the Priors in the Ori galaxy and through them their followers. With Adria now in a weakened state, Morgan is able to engage her in an eternal battle.  SG-1 exposes the Prior on Earth to the Ark, transmitting the knowledge about the Ori to all of the Priors in the Milky Way, and thus turning all known Priors in the Universe.  In the aftermath, Tomin departs for the Ori galaxy as the new leader of his people, he and Vala agreeing that, while the Ori were liars, Origin itself has a worthwhile message. Tomin asks Vala to come with him, but Vala apologizes and says that she feels her place is with the SGC. Over Daniel's objections the Ark is taken to Area 51 for study while SG-1 later prepare for another new mission through the Stargate.  
Stargate: Continuum
 SG-1 and [[Jack O'Neill]] attend a [[Tok'ra]] extraction ceremony for [[Goa'uld characters in Stargate#Ba'al|Ba'al]], the last of the [[Goa'uld]] [[System Lord]]s. Ba'al claims, however, that he is merely the last clone and that the real Ba'al has a [[fail-safe]] plan. The real Ba'al travels back in time to 1939 Earth and massacres the crew of the ''Achilles'', the ship carrying the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] to the United States; the captain lives long enough to drop the bomb Ba'al left overboard and keep the ship from being destroyed. In the present, people and objects start disappearing, including [[Vala Mal Doran]] and [[Teal'c]]. Jack is killed by the clone, but [[Samantha Carter]], [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] and [[Cameron Mitchell (Stargate)|Cameron Mitchell]] reach the Stargate. They are surprised to emerge inside the derelict ''Achilles'', which has drifted to the Arctic&nbsp;— Ba'al's actions have created a timeline in which the [[Stargate Program]] never happened. After escaping from the sinking ''Achilles'', they are rescued by a team led by Colonel Jack O'Neill. Although General [[Hank Landry (Stargate)|Landry]] believes their story (after intensive interrogation), they are denied permission to change the timeline. In the alternate timeline, Daniel is still trying to convince people about his theories of the pyramids, Carter died in a space shuttle accident and Mitchell does not exist at all because his grandfather was the ''Achilles'' captain. The three are forced by the authorities to lead separate lives, with no contact allowed between them.  A year passes, and SG-1 is called back into action when Goa'uld scoutships appear. Ba'al has brought the other System Lords under his control and now stands ready to conquer Earth, with [[Goa'uld characters in Stargate#Qetesh|Qetesh]], still residing in Vala's body, as his queen and Teal'c as his First Prime. SG-1 is brought to President [[Henry Hayes (Stargate)|Henry Hayes]] and General [[George Hammond (Stargate)|George Hammond]], who inform them that, based on SG-1's accounts, they have recovered the Antarctic Stargate and are excavating the Antarctic Ancient outpost to reach the weapon that saved Earth in the original timeline. SG-1 is sent in [[F-15]]s to [[McMurdo Station]] to gate to [[Proclarush Taonas]], another Ancient outpost, to retrieve a [[Zero Point Module]] to power the Antarctic outpost.  Above Earth, Ba'al's armada arrives. To the displeasure of his subordinates, the other System Lords, Ba'al announces that he will treat the [[Tau'ri]] relatively leniently. Suspicious about Ba'al's thorough knowledge of Earth, Qetesh betrays him and forces him to tell her everything. She orders the destruction of McMurdo and the Ancient outpost in Ba'al's name, but she kills Ba'al when Teal'c discovers what she is doing. As Teal'c escapes to an [[Al'kesh]], Qetesh orders the fleet to bombard Earth, while she goes to secure Ba'al's time machine.  When the Goa'uld destroy the Antarctic Stargate, SG-1 is rerouted to [[Russia]], as the Russians had retrieved the ''Achilles'' Stargate from the ocean floor. Teal'c arrives at the facility as well, seeking to use the Stargate to reach the time machine before Qetesh. The two sides agree to a truce and get to Ba'al's time machine: an underground supercomputer connected to hundreds of satellites that monitor [[solar flare]]s from various stars that could intersect a [[wormhole]] created by the Stargate; the flares are necessary for time travel. SG-1 must wait for the right flare in order to journey to the right time, but when Qetesh's troops attack, they are forced to dial the Stargate to the year 1929 - ten years before their desired target date. Sam and Daniel are killed in the firefight, and only Mitchell passes through the Stargate. Teal'c, mortally wounded, blows himself and Qetesh up. After a decade of waiting, Mitchell stows away on the ''Achilles'' and kills Ba'al and his troops when they come aboard through the Stargate.   In the now-restored timeline, SG-1, completely unaware of the previous events, watch the extraction proceed without incident. On Earth, Daniel wonders what Ba'al meant by his fail-safe.  
Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)
  During the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]], [[Jedi|Jedi Knights]] [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] lead a small [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] [[Clone troopers|clone army]] against the Separatist droid army on the planet [[wookieepedia:Christophsis|Christophsis]]. Awaiting reinforcements, the two Jedi greet a shuttle carrying the young Jedi [[Ahsoka Tano]], who insists that she has been assigned by Jedi Master [[Yoda]] to serve as Anakin's Padawan. Anakin begrudgingly accepts Ahsoka's apprenticeship, and the two succeed in deactivating the Separatists' energy field while Obi-Wan stalls the droid army commander, allowing a Republic victory. Ahsoka earns Anakin's respect.  Following the battle, Yoda arrives and informs the Jedi that crime lord [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s son Rotta has been kidnapped. Anakin and Ahsoka are tasked with retrieving the Huttlet, while Obi-Wan is sent to [[Tatooine]] to negotiate with Jabba over a potential treaty between the Hutts and the Republic. Anakin and Ahsoka find Rotta on the planet Teth, where they are ambushed by Separatist forces led by [[Count Dooku]]'s apprentice [[Asajj Ventress]], discovering that Dooku hopes to frame the Jedi for Rotta's kidnapping. The Jedi manage to escape the trap along with [[R2-D2]] and hijack a derelict transport with which they travel to Tatooine. Obi-Wan, alerted by Anakin, arrives on Teth and defeats Ventress in a [[lightsaber]] duel, though she manages to escape.  Meanwhile, Senator [[Padmé Amidala]], Anakin's secret wife, learns of Anakin's mission and fears for his safety. She decides to contact Jabba's uncle [[Hutt (Star Wars)#Ziro the Hutt|Ziro]] in Coruscant. The Hutt refuses to cooperate, apparently believing that it is the Jedi who are responsible for the situation. However, Padmé soon discovers that Ziro has actually conspired with Dooku to have Rotta killed in order for Jabba to have Anakin and Ahsoka executed in return, which will force the Jedi Council, led by Yoda, to take Jabba into custody and allow Ziro to seize power over the Hutt clans. Padmé is discovered and detained, but a chance call by [[C-3PO]] enables her to summon a squadron of clone troopers, and Ziro is arrested.  Upon their arrival on Tatooine, Anakin and Ahsoka are shot down by [[MagnaGuards]]. Anakin devises a ruse to confront Dooku while carrying a decoy Rotta, leaving Ahsoka to take the real Rotta to Jabba's palace. While Anakin fights off Dooku, Ahsoka is ambushed by the MagnaGuards, whom she defeats. The two deliver Rotta safely to Jabba, who nonetheless orders the Jedi's execution for their supposed attempt to kidnap him. However, Padmé contacts Jabba in time and reveals Ziro and the Separatists' responsibility for the kidnapping. Acknowledging the Jedi's heroism and allowing the Republic to have Ziro punished for his betrayal, Jabba agrees to the Republic treaty while Anakin and Ahsoka are retrieved by Obi-Wan and Yoda. In the meantime during his escape, Dooku reports to his master [[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]] about the failure of their plot against the Jedi and Jabba, but the Sith Lord assures him that the tide of war is still in their favor.  
Star Trek: Chains of Betrayal
  After the sudden disappearance of Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]], Commander [[William Riker]] must take command of the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise-D]]'', and guide his crew through a treacherous web of lies and betrayal. Due to the recent [[Vulcan_(Star_Trek)#Mind_melds|mind-meld]] they shared together, Ambassador [[Spock]] is sent to investigate Picard’s disappearance, undermining a shattered Riker. Spock searches through personal logs and makes accusations, polarizing the crew. His presence on the Federation flagship initiates a chain reaction that ultimately envelops the [[Klingon]]s, [[Romulan]]s and [[Starfleet]]’s highest-ranking officials, and takes the ''Enterprise'' into the depths of the [[List_of_Star_Trek_regions_of_space#Romulan_Neutral_Zone|Romulan Neutral Zone]].   
Starship Troopers 3: Marauder
 In the past eleven years of "The Second Bug War", the [[Mobile Infantry (Starship Troopers)|Mobile Infantry]] has improved their weapons and tactics. However, as they adapt, so do the [[Bug (Starship Troopers)|Bugs]], and many new Arachnid variants have developed. The [[Terran Federation (Starship Troopers)|United Citizen Federation]] now finds itself engaged in [[trench warfare]] on the [[frontier]] planets. The Federation puts a positive spin on this in the media while using its judicial and military authority to suppress peace protesters and religious fanatics as seditionists.  [[Colonel]] Johnny Rico ([[Casper Van Dien]]) is stationed on the [[agriculture|agrarian]] planet Roku San when the popular [[Sky Marshal]] (and singer) Omar Anoke (Stephen Hogan) pays a visit. Off-duty, Rico's old friend [[General officer|General]] Dix Hauser ([[Boris Kodjoe]]) gets into a bar fight with farmers protesting against the war. During the fight, Rico stops Dix from shooting one of the farmers. Dix tries to have Rico arrested, but the base defences suddenly fail due to an alien attack. Rico knocks Dix to the floor and leaves to help fight the Arachnids. When Roku San falls, Rico is blamed by the Federal Media and set for execution for insubordination and striking a superior officer.  However Dix has Rico's execution faked, so that Rico can lead a rescue mission.  On their way back to Sanctuary, the Fleet's secret HQ, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Lola Beck ([[Jolene Blalock]]) is marooned on a classified planet, OM-1, with Sky Marshal Anoke.  [[Admiral]] Enolo Phid ([[Amanda Donohoe]]) suppresses this information. Dix finds out thanks to an officer who thinks this is wrong and recruits Rico to rescue the Sky Marshal and Lola, the latter being one of the few in possession of the coordinates to Sanctuary, which would cripple the military if the Arachnids learned of its location. An apparent earthquake causes Dr. Wiggs (Danny Keogh) to fall into a crevasse, while the Sky Marshal views a giant eye staring back at him from below. Cynical cook Jingo Ryan (Jon Falkow) is next to die after he takes shelter within a cluster of supposed rock outcroppings, which are actually Arachnid limbs which pull him below. Engineer Bull Brittles ([[Stelio Savante]]) asks the very religious [[flight attendant]], Holly Little ([[Marnette Patterson]]), to marry him, but dies shortly after.  On Earth, General Hauser confronts Admiral Phid about why she is abandoning the Sky Marshal, only to be arrested. Later, Phid reveals to him that Sky Marshal Anoke is responsible for the downfall of Roku San, having been in communication with the "Brain of Brains", also known as "Behemecoatyl", through the original brain bug captured in ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]'', as he has psychic powers. The Sky Marshal adopted their religion, hoping he could save humanity from the bugs if he could make peace with them. It is revealed that he turned off the electric barrier surrounding the base on Roku San to show his willingness to make peace between the two species.  The Federation now believes the Brain Bug ''allowed'' itself to be captured in the first place on Planet P in order to pass on intelligence from inside the Federation. The Federation makes the decision to kill and dissect the captured brain but it overhears them and unleashes a telepathic attack, killing a few soldiers by exploding their skulls before Hauser kills it. It is revealed that Admiral Phid ignored the distress calls of those abandoned on OM-1 so she could become the new Sky Marshal; however, she failed to take into account that Lola, who is one of the few pilots of the Federation that know the location of Sanctuary, was with Anoke.  Back on OM-1, the stranded make contact with The Brain of Brains, who communicates with them through the corpses of their fallen comrades and soon kills Anoke for his knowledge; Lola and Holly, the last two left alive, begin to pray that they will be saved.  Rico leads the Marauders, an elite team of troopers composed of his command staff from Roku San, on a rescue mission, using the Federation's new battle-suits. They defeat the Arachnid warriors on OM-1, suffer no casualties, and rescue the two survivors. OM-1 is revealed to be the home of the Bug Hive, the Arachnids' ruling body, and Fleet destroys it from orbit with a [[planet killer|planet-destroying]] "Q Bomb".  Rico is apparently cleared of charges and subsequently awarded a promotion to the rank of General, and given permanent command of the Marauder program. Anoke is reported to have died in a terrorist attack (staged by the government earlier to explain his disappearance) and given a [[state funeral|hero's funeral]]. Dix and Lola are married, Admiral Phid is appointed the new Sky Marshal with Dix as her second-in command, and Holly becomes a Federal [[chaplain]]. Dozens of peace protesters are hanged in connection to the purported terrorist attack.  The new Sky Marshal Phid, impressed with the way that Sky Marshal Anoke was rendered servile by the Arachnids' religion, decides the Federation should adopt a religion, and Christianity is embraced by the Federation.

Brennan and Dale despise each other for interfering with their lifestyles. Dale warns Brennan not to touch Dale's drum set, which Brennan later does anyway and is confronted by Dale. Brennan further enrages Dale by rubbing his genitals all over the drum set, and a violent brawl ensues between them. They are grounded for a week following the incident and told they must find jobs within a month, or they will be evicted from the house.   When Brennan's younger and more successful brother Derek, the [[Executive Vice-President|Executive Vice President]] of a helicopter chartering corporation, comes to visit with his family, he openly ridicules them for their lack of ambition, enticing Dale to punch him in the face.

Dale and Brennan decide to start a [[Multinational corporation|large]] [[Show business|entertainment company]], Prestige Worldwide. They present their first music video, which they filmed on Robert's boat, at Derek's birthday party. The presentation backfires when the video shows the boat crashing. Robert is furious and refuses to make an investment. On Christmas Day, Robert announces he and Nancy are getting divorced, causing Brennan and Dale to break down.

Dale ends his relationship with Alice to her dismay.  Six months later, Robert and Nancy are back together living in their old house. Brennan and his therapist Denise are in a relationship, while Brennan and Dale have turned Prestige Worldwide into a successful entertainment company that runs [[karaoke]] events. Robert has his boat repaired and put on display in the backyard. In a mid-credits scene, Brennan and Dale stand up to a group of bullies from a middle school who abused Dale a year prior. In a post-credits scene, Brennan and Dale sleepwalk once more.  
Step Up 2: The Streets
 In [[Baltimore, Maryland]], Andrea "Andie" West pursues her dream of becoming a street dancer. After her mother died from cancer, Andie moved in with her mother's best friend, Sarah. Deep down Andie feels like she does not belong anywhere. Although she is doing poorly at school, it is her dream for dancing that brings something special into her life. She trains with her dance crew, 410 to keep the title of the illegal competition, "The Streets". Sarah is aware of the crime and harassment by 410 and out of fear that Andie will get hurt, she decides to send her to live with her aunt in Texas in an effort to protect Andie, but Andie refuses to go and runs away.  Tyler Gage who is like a big brother to Andie sees her at a local dance club, The Dragon. When Andie tells him about Sarah's plans to send her to Texas to live with her aunt Tyler explains that Sarah's trying to keep Andie safe. He tries to persuade Andie to audition for the Maryland School of the Arts, where Andie has to compete for a place, thinking it will help her life as it did his. Tyler decides to battle her for it. Tyler wins the battle and the two head back to Andie's house where Tyler asks Sarah to let her audition for MSA. Sarah refuses because she believes that Andie will be safer in Texas. Tyler eventually persuades Sarah to let Andie audition for MSA while he goes on tour with Nora Clark, the girl from the original ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. Sarah reluctantly agrees, but she tells Andie that if she screws up with MSA she'll have to go to Texas. Chase Collins persuades his brother, Director Blake Collins to recruit Andie after seeing her audition. When 410 learns about Andie's involvement at MSA, they kick her out. Chase and Andie form a new crew with help from many people Chase knows at the school, all of not accepted as who they are, including Andie's new friend Moose. Chase has a copied key to the studio and the crew secretly practices their routine late at night when the school is empty. They perform at the local dance club, but are rejected and kicked out. Andie's best friend Missy Serrano joins the crew after leaving 410 following the event, as she is disgusted by the crowd's reaction. Missy tells the crew that the only way to enter The Streets is to first pull a prank and post it on the Internet to show that the crew is entering the competition. Wanting revenge for being humiliated before, Chase decides that their prank will be to make a fool out of Tuck, the leader of 410.  The crew goes to a family barbecue at Missy's house. Sophie, an MSA student who happens to have a crush on Chase, tags along. She begins to develop a crush on Moose after salsa dancing with him. 410 doesn't like the fact that they have a new crew to compete with so they warn Andie's group to stay out of The Streets or there will be consequences. When Tuck finds Chase, he assaults him for his prank and warns him to stay away from The Streets and Andie. Chase comes into school the next day badly bruised and hurt. On top of that, the dance studio has been trashed by 410 the previous night. Director Blake forbids the students from the school to be involved in illegal competitions and expels Andie from MSA for her involvement with The Streets competition, but Andie denies the involvement of her other members. After she leaves, Chase admits his involvement in The Streets and tries to persuade Director Blake to let Andie back in, but Director Blake refuses as he is too busy with the fundraiser.  When Sarah hears the news of Andie's expulsion, Andie tries to explain, but Sarah refuses to listen. Sarah tells her that she has had enough of her behavior and now Andie must go live with her aunt in Texas. Just when Andie is packing her bags to leave, she receives a text message from Missy that The Streets is on the same night as the MSA fundraiser. Along with Andie, her whole crew gets the text message. They decide to ditch the MSA fundraiser and instead compete in The Streets. Chase also leaves the fundraiser hoping to win back Andie. When Sarah hears about what Andie did to protect her crew she allows Andie to continue living with her and lets her compete at The Streets with her crew. Sarah does ground Andie.   When Director Blake notices that his students are gone, he questions Sophie. Moose tells him that he is in the crew and where they are. Moose takes both Director Blake and Sophie to the place; they are just in time for the crew's performance. The Director sees them and he realizes that The Streets he was hearing and thinking about, is in fact a legitimate form of artistic expression. He accepts Andie into MSA again and tells Moose that he was in the wrong department. To Moose's surprise, he gets kissed by Sophie. With Andie's crew being supportive friends and her education now secured, the film ends with a passionate kiss between Chase and Andie.

Stop-Loss (film)
 [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Staff sergeant#United States|Staff Sergeant]] Brandon King ([[Ryan Phillippe]]) leads a squad stationed in [[Tikrit]] during the [[Iraq War]]. The film begins with footage from the tour of the squad, explaining they have 28 days before returning to the United States. While on duty at a checkpoint, the squad hears gunshots, after which a car speeds past filled with insurgents, one of whom fires an AK-47 at them. King's men jump into their Humvees and follow the insurgents into an alley. When the soldiers get out of their vehicles, the insurgents ambush them from rooftops.  As the firefight ensues, a [[rocket propelled grenade]] (RPG) is discharged, destroying one of the Humvees, killing two soldiers inside. Shortly after, another RPG is discharged, exploding an Iraqi vehicle. Squad member PFC Tommy Burgess ([[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]) is unfortunately near the vehicle when the RPG is discharged but another soldier, Pvt. Rico Rodriguez, dives on Burgess and saves him. This is at the expense of severely wounding Pvt. Rodriguez. Shortly after, fellow squad member Paul "Preacher" Colston, a close friend of Tommy, is shot in the neck and jaw in front of Tommy, and is killed instantly.  Later, when Staff Sergeant King enters a house to help injured long-time friend and squad member Sgt. Steve Shriver ([[Channing Tatum]]), he discovers that he had accidentally killed several Iraqi civilians by throwing a grenade to kill an insurgent in a room, unaware of any civilians present in the area. Brandon is visibly shocked and the ambush ends with three soldiers killed.  Upon returning to their [[Texas]] hometown of Brazos, Brandon and Steve are decorated with the Bronze Star and Purple Heart in a solemn ceremony. A U.S. Senator takes Brandon aside after the ceremony and offers to help Brandon in any way he can. That night, Steve shows the effects of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. He gets drunk and digs a foxhole in his front yard, and strikes his fiancée Michelle ([[Abbie Cornish]]) in the face. When Brandon comes over to check on Steve, he is unable to get through to him. Tommy drives over drunk after his wife has kicked him out.  The next day, Brandon suggests that they all go to the "ranch", a small forest cabin located outside of town. The men pass the time by drinking and watching Tommy shoot his wedding gifts, after their friend Shorty reads the cards. Upon hearing the commotion, a hungover Steve awakens and shoots the cards to silence them and to show his skills in sniping. The next day, Brandon, Tommy and Steve report to their military base. When Brandon arrives expecting to be discharged, he is unexpectedly ordered back to active duty in [[Iraq]], based on the military's controversial [[stop-loss policy]], which required soldiers who had fulfilled their required tours of duty to return to the war. He refuses to comply and goes [[AWOL]], becoming a deserter.  Michelle sympathizes with Brandon's refusal and offers to travel with him to Washington, D.C. to see the Senator who offered to assist Brandon earlier. During a multi-day drive to Washington, D.C., Brandon calls the Senator's office and is told that because he is now a fugitive, the Senator is not interested in seeing him. Brandon and Michelle also visit the family of Paul "Preacher" Colson, one of the three soldiers under Brandon's command killed in the alley ambush and encounter another AWOL soldier who recommends a lawyer to help arrange forged discharge documents so he could establish a new identity in Canada.  They also visit Rico Rodriguez, a soldier who was [[blindness|blinded]], lost his right arm and leg, and sustained facial burns from saving Tommy from a rocket-propelled grenade, previously during the ambush in Iraq. After Michelle phones Steve to tell him of their exact location, he arrives in uniform to take Brandon back, and tells Michelle he has volunteered to return to Iraq. Brandon refuses to return and Michelle is furious with Steve for re-enlisting and ends their relationship. Brandon and Michelle finally reach New York City and meet with the lawyer, who gives Brandon forged papers and a passport which would allow him to flee to Canada in exchange for payment of $1000. Tommy, who is [[clinical depression|depressed]] after being discharged from the army, commits [[suicide]], Brandon returns to visit Tommy's grave immediately after the funeral, only to end up in a dispute with Steve, ultimately turning into a physical battle ending with Brandon leaving the cemetery and Steve weeping.  Brandon, his mother and Michelle drive to the [[Mexican border]], but Brandon ultimately decides that he does not want to abandon everything that he has ever known. He also tells his mother and Michelle that if he goes to Mexico he'll never really be able to leave the war behind him. The final scene depicts a busload of soldiers, including Brandon and Steve, returning to the war.

Stone of Destiny (film)
 In 1950 [[Ian Hamilton (lawyer)|Ian Hamilton]] ([[Charlie Cox]]), an ardent member of the [[Scottish independence|Scottish nationalist]] organisation, the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], hopes to end what he sees as the political and economic subjugation of Scotland by England. Frustrated and saddened by the complacency of his fellow Scots who seem to accept the status quo, he looks forward to a time when Scotland is no longer merely referred to as "[[North Britain]]". After a petition to the [[British Parliament]] for the establishment of Scottish [[home rule]] is rejected, Hamilton decides to perform a symbolic act to put heart into the movement. With his friend, Bill Craig ([[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]]), he creates a daring scheme to bring the [[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]] back to Scotland from [[Westminster Abbey]] in London, where it has resided for centuries following English military victories over the Scots in the [[Middle Ages]].  Hamilton and Craig research the floor plans and security setup of Westminster Abbey and plan the theft, but once Craig realises the legal implications of liberating the stone and the potential impact to his personal life and career, he backs out. Undaunted, Hamilton decides to liberate the stone by himself. He turns to [[John MacCormick]] ([[Robert Carlyle]]), a prominent campaigner for Scottish devolution, and asks for financial help with the project. Although he initially refuses to take seriously Hamilton's proposal and request for a mere £50, MacCormick reconsiders and provides his support. Later at a party, MacCormick refers him to Kay Matheson ([[Kate Mara]]), a young woman with strong nationalist ideas, to help him retrieve the stone.  After meeting Matheson, Hamilton is soon introduced to [[Gavin Vernon]] ([[Stephen McCole]]), a strong young man (another student) known mainly for his drinking ability. On the day of their departure for London, Vernon unexpectedly brings his quiet friend Alan Stuart (Ciaron Kelly) along with him. At first Hamilton opposes bringing in a fourth member, but Vernon convinces him that Stuart and his car will be valuable assets to the group. They agree to steal the stone on Christmas Eve while all of London is distracted by the holiday celebration.  The four nationalist students arrive in London the day before Christmas Eve and decide to steal the stone that very night, instead of their original plan of the following night. They drive to Westminster Abbey, but their plans are interrupted when Hamilton is discovered by a watchman, who mistakes him for a homeless man and lets him go. Soon after, Matheson falls ill from a fever and Hamilton brings her to a bed & breakfast inn to recover. The landlady is suspicious of their Scottish accents and shifty behavior, and when Hamilton comes for Matheson at 2:00 A.M., she phones the police, who likewise suspect the young Scots of being up to something, but they avoid being arrested.  That night, while Matheson waits in the car, Hamilton, Vernon, and Stuart break into Westminster Abbey and steal the Stone of Scone, which breaks in two pieces in the process. Seeing that the crack was made long ago and merely patched over, the group drive to the Scottish border and hide the larger piece in a field. After returning to Glasgow and witnessing the widespread nationalist celebration over the theft of the stone, the group learn that the stone could be permanently damaged if left to the elements. They return to the field and retrieve the stone with the aid of a group of [[Romanichal|Romani]] people who are camped in the field.  After the two parts of the stone are reattached, the students offer to return it to the authorities at the symbolically significant [[Arbroath Abbey]], the site of the signing of the [[Declaration of Arbroath]]. The police arrive and arrest the student nationalists, who are charged, but never prosecuted.</ref>|group=N}} The Stone of Scone was returned to London, where it remained until 1996, when it was moved to Edinburgh Castle "on loan" with the understanding that it would be brought back to Westminster Abbey for the next [[Coronation of the British monarch|Coronation]].  
The Stoning of Soraya M.
 Stranded in the remote [[Iran]]ian village of [[Kuhpayeh]] by car trouble, [[Freidoune Sahebjam|a journalist]] is approached by Zahra, a woman with a harrowing tale to tell about her niece, Soraya, and the bloody circumstances of Soraya's death, by [[stoning]], the previous day. The two sit down as Zahra recounts the story to Freidoune, who records the conversation with his tape recorder. The journalist must escape with his life to tell the story to the rest of the world.  Ali is [[Soraya Manutchehri|Soraya]]'s abusive husband who tries to get the village's [[mullah]] to convince Soraya to grant him a divorce so that he can [[Child marriage|marry a 14-year-old girl]].<ref name="screenrant"></ref><ref name="catholicnews"></ref> Ali is able to convince the mullah by making threats to tell the rest of the village about his past as a convict.  Ali's marriage to the teenager is conditional on Ali's ability to save the girl's father, a doctor who has been sentenced to death for an unspecified crime. The mullah proposes that Soraya becomes his temporary wife, referred to in Iran as 'Sigeh', in exchange for protection and monetary support for Soraya and her two daughters. Zahra barges in and encourages Soraya to refuse the offer. Soraya has two sons whom Ali wants, and who have both turned against her. Some days following the incident, a woman dies. The mullah, the village's mayor, and Ali ask Zahra to persuade Soraya to care for the widower. Zahra suggests that Soraya may do the job if she is paid.  Soraya starts working for the widower, and Ali plans to use the unusual circumstance to spread lies that Soraya is being unfaithful to him so that she will be stoned and he can remarry. Ali also knows if Soraya were dead, he would not have to pay child support. Ali and the mullah start a rumor about Soraya's [[infidelity]] so they can charge her with [[adultery]]. One day while Zahra is walking in town, she realizes that a rumor has spread that her niece is being unfaithful to her husband.  Ali and the mullah need one more "witness" to Soraya's "infidelity" to be able to formally charge her. They visit the widower at home and, using threats, manipulate the widower into agreeing to back up their story. Soon after, Ali drags Soraya through the streets, beating her and publicly declaring that she has been unfaithful. Zahra intervenes, and takes her niece, Ali, and the Mayor of the village to her house to talk privately. They bring the widower to the home, and, after he lies and says that they had engaged in adultery, a trial is pursued. Only men, including Soraya's father, are allowed while Soraya is confined with some women in Zahra's house. She is quickly convicted. Zahra tries to flee with her and after realizing she cannot, goes to plead with the mayor for Soraya's life, even offering to switch places with Soraya. The conviction is upheld though, and as they are preparing for the stoning, the Mayor prays to Allah for a sign if they are not doing the right thing.<ref></ref>  Before the actual stoning can begin, a traveling carnival van comes through and tries to perform their act. They are shooed away, where they wait by the sidelines as the stoning begins. Soraya's father disowns her as he is given the first stone to throw but he misses her repeatedly. A woman in the crowd pleads to the mayor that the stones missing are a sign Soraya is innocent, but none of the men listen. Ali takes up stones and throws them himself. Her two sons are also forced to throw stones.<ref name="screenrant" /><ref name="catholicnews" /> The widower is given two stones to throw but instead walks away in tears. The crowd finally joins in and Soraya is stoned to death.  Zahra is heard narrating the story to the journalist about her niece. Soon, the widower walks in and informs the journalist that his car is fixed. A short while later, the mullah and the widower are informed by Ali that his marriage to the teenage girl is off, implying that he could not spare her father from execution. Angry about the fact that he had been coerced by Ali and the mullah into lying, the widower admits that he lied. As the journalist attempts to leave with his belongings and collect his vehicle since it has been repaired by the widower, the mullah orders a [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guard]] to stop him at gunpoint. They spill out the belongings of his bag, seize his tape recorder, and destroy all of the tapes. But as the journalist prepares to drive away, Zahra appears out of an alley with the true tape in her hand. Men attempt to run after the car before the journalist is able to drive away. Zahra screams that the God that she loves is great and now the whole world will know of the injustice that has happened.<ref name="screenrant" /><ref name="catholicnews" />

Street Kings
 Tom Ludlow ([[Keanu Reeves]]) is a disillusioned [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Vice detective working for a unit known as Vice Special and haunted by the death of his wife. Working undercover, he meets with Korean gangsters (who he believes have kidnapped two Korean schoolgirls) in a parking lot, who are looking to buy a [[machine gun]] from him. After a vicious beatdown, the Koreans then proceed to steal his car. This was planned, however, and he has the cops locate the vehicle via [[GPS]]. Upon arrival at their hideout, Ludlow storms in and kills the four gangsters inside, then locates the missing children after the shootout and altering the crime scene such that he killed the gangsters by returning fire. While the other officers in his unit congratulate him, he is confronted by his former partner, Detective Terrence Washington ([[Terry Crews]]), who no longer approves of the corruption as well as the deception and has gone straight, reporting the problems to Captain James Biggs ([[Hugh Laurie]]), of [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]], who apparently starts an investigation against Ludlow.  Believing that Washington was "snitching" on him, Ludlow follows him to a convenience store to beat him up. However, Washington is executed in the store in an apparent gangland hit albeit with heavy fire by two gangbangers under the pretense of a robbery. Though Ludlow is innocent and the two were working together to fight back, the surveillance video of the shootout shows him to have accidentally shot Washington while trying to protect him with his .38 revolver, which can heavily implicate him in the murder. The DNA of two criminals known as Fremont and Coates is found at the scene, as well as a large amount of cash in Washington's possession. It is assumed that Washington himself was corrupt, despite his seemingly changed attitude, and that he had been stealing drugs from the department's evidence room and selling them to Fremont and Coates. Ludlow teams up with Detective Paul "Disco" Diskant ([[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]]), who has been assigned to the case to join him in his personal investigation.  Their search for the two involves some tough interrogation of a Latino gang member named Quiks ([[Noel Gugliemi]]), a [[Crips]] gang member named Grill ([[The Game (rapper)|The Game]]), and a drug addict/dealer named Winston "Scribble" ([[Cedric the Entertainer]]), which eventually leads them to a house in the hills where they discover the bodies of the real Fremont and Coates buried in a shallow grave. The condition of the bodies makes it apparent that they were killed well before Washington's murder. Ludlow and Disco, posing as dirty cops who are willing to take over Washington's supposed activity of stealing and selling drugs, are able to set up a meeting through Winston with two criminals masquerading as Fremont ([[Cle Shaheed Sloan]]) and Coates ([[Common (rapper)|Common]]). Freemont and Coates then recognize Ludlow as the cop that was present at the convenience store robbery, prompting Ludlow to question who Freemont and Coates really are, and in turn Disco quickly states he recognizes the two, and he is shot and killed immediately, along with Winston. Ludlow manages to kill both men and escapes back to his girlfriend's house, where a news report reveals the killers were undercover [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|LASD]] deputies (Wander later states that the two had been in deep cover for so long that they "lost their fucking minds" and had become corrupt cops).  Shortly afterward, Ludlow is subdued at his girlfriend's house by Detective Cosmo Santos ([[Amaury Nolasco]]) and Detective Dante Demille ([[John Corbett (actor)|John Corbett]]), two fellow officers from his unit who admit that they planted Fremont and Coates' DNA and the drugs at the scene of Washington's murder, and Ludlow learns that it was their captain, Jack Wander ([[Forest Whitaker]]), not Ludlow, that Washington was giving up to Biggs, and they were the ones that were stealing drugs from the department's evidence room. The two cops take Ludlow out to the house where the two bodies of the real Fremont and Coates were found earlier for execution. However, Ludlow manages to kill both of them. He then heads to Washington's house to take care of their supervisor, Sergeant Mike Clady ([[Jay Mohr]]), who was about to kill Washington's widow. He captures Clady and places him in the trunk of his car.  Ludlow eventually learns that he has been a pawn in a plan masterminded by Captain Wander. He shows up at his house intending to kill him and after a brief struggle, he finds out that Wander has incriminating evidence against almost all in the department, as well as judges, councilmen and politicians. With so many people in Wander's pocket, he has been able to quickly move up the department's ranks as well as conceal his unit's corruption. He then tries to convince Ludlow that he is his friend and best officer before trying to bribe him with a large amount of stolen money and incriminating documents hidden in a wall of his home. Angry with all that he has been made privy to and how it has come about, Ludlow shoots and kills Wander.  Captain Biggs and Sergeant Green arrive at the scene, and Biggs reveals to Ludlow that they used him to bring down Wander and get access to his files by opening his eyes to the real corruption going on within his unit. As he leaves, Biggs tells Ludlow that the department does need him.

These incidents result in the group's funds being drained.  The group arrive three days to Bill's cabin and learn that he already sold the map to Pierson. However, he manages to make a copy of the map since Pierson studied the map under one of Bill's security cameras. He also manages to acquire the help of renowned tracker, Gus Hayden, but the group doesn't have the money to hire him. While urinating in the bushes, Peter is attacked out of nowhere by a mother turkey and ends up with his penis inside the bird's mouth.

The group stops the doctor from cutting the turkey's head off when a wildlife ranger and his son, who are the turkey's owners, say there is a $5,000 reward for the bird's return.  The group continue their journey and eventually reach Ecuador where they meet up with Dick, a friend of Bill and explorer, who takes them to Gus Hayden. The next morning, however, they wake up to find that Gus has left, stolen their equipment, and Cheryl has gone with him. Though hesitant and Peter not willing to give up, Dick agrees to lead the group through the jungle. During the night, Cheryl catches up with the group where she explains that she saw Gus stealing their equipment and pretended to run off with him so she could convince him to give her the map. The next day while crossing the river, Dick gets attacked and eaten by piranhas. They also come across Pierson's camp and find that he and his team have been killed by local pygmies.

They return to the studio to show Lawson their footage, where he berates them for their ridiculousness and cancels the show. This leads to a huge fight within the group.     A year later, Peter gets a visit from Milas (the original cameraman and a friend of his father) and encourages him to revive the show. Peter gets everyone back together and they make an episode about a shark attack. They show the episode to Lawson, who decides to put the show back on the air since people love shark attacks and Pierson's death gives them no competition.

A young blonde woman, whose face is hiding in the shadows, asks for Tamara. When told that she is at the wrong house, she leaves with the casual caveat that she will "see them later".  Due to the tension between them, James leaves to go for a drive and purchase a pack of cigarettes for Kristen; before he departs, he starts a fire in the hearth. Shortly after he leaves, Kristen realizes the chimney flue is closed, and attempts to open it; while she does this, smoke emanating from the fire triggers a smoke alarm. Kristen attempts to disarm the smoke alarm when she is startled by another knock at the door; she drops the alarm on the floor and retreats to the bedroom, unnerved. She calls James' cellphone from the landline, but their call is cut short. She returns to the kitchen, where, unbeknownst to her, a man in a sack mask watches her from an adjacent hallway.   In the living room, Kristen notices the smoke alarm she left on the floor is now sitting on a chair, and realizes someone else has been in the house. Upon going to retrieve her cell phone from the wall charger, she finds it is missing, and begins to panic. When she hears a noise from the backyard, she arms herself with a knife, and opens the curtains to find the man in the mask, staring at her. She stumbles into the hallway, and watches as the front door unlatches. When she goes to push the door closed, she sees the blonde woman outside, now in a dollface mask. After locking the door, Kristen hides in the bedroom and hears the strangers outside banging violently against the walls of the house.  The noise eventually stops and James returns to the home. After she explains what has happened, he goes outside to the car to get his phone, whereupon he finds the car ransacked and sees Dollface watching him from afar. The couple attempt to leave in James' car but another woman in a Pin-up mask rear-ends them with a pickup truck, forcing them to flee. Back inside the house, Kristen and James find a shotgun and wait for the intruders in a bedroom. One of the strangers enters and puts a country record on the turntable, filling the house with music.  Mike arrives and realizes something is wrong after seeing the smashed car in the driveway. He enters the house, and James, mistaking him for one of the strangers, shoots him dead. Devastated, James remembers an old radio transmitter in the backyard shed. He leaves and encounters Pin-up searching the backyard with a flashlight. When James tries to shoot her, the Man in the Mask knocks him unconscious, discharging the gun in the process. Kristen hears the shot, and runs to the shed. She finds the radio, but Pin-up smashes it with a sledgehammer. Kristen rushes back to the house, where she encounters Dollface, who taunts her. She tries to leave but is incapacitated by the Man in the Mask.  James and Kristen awaken at dawn, and find themselves tied to chairs in the living room with the masked strangers standing before them. Kristen asks them why they are doing this, to which Dollface replies, "Because you were home." The strangers then unmask themselves to the couple offscreen, and take turns stabbing the couple in the stomach and chest before leaving the home. As they drive away in the pickup truck, they ride past two young boys on bicycles distributing [[Tract (literature)|religious tracts]] door-to-door. Dollface gets out of the truck and asks for a tract. The boy asks if she's a sinner and she replies, "Sometimes." The strangers drive away, as Pin-up states, "It'll be easier next time."

Sunshine Cleaning
 Rose Lorkowski ([[Amy Adams]]) is a thirty-something single mother, working full-time as a maid. Her underachieving and unreliable sister Norah ([[Emily Blunt]]) lives with their father Joe ([[Alan Arkin]]), and is fired from her job as a waitress. Rose's hyperactive and disruptive 8-year-old son Oscar ([[Jason Spevack]]) upsets his school officials by his erratic behavior, and they order Rose to put him on medication or send him to a private school. Unable to make enough money with her current job, Rose asks Mac ([[Steve Zahn]]), her ex-boyfriend during their high school years and her married lover, for advice. Mac recommends a [[crime scene cleanup]] job, and with his connections as a police officer, he gets Rose and Norah into the business.  At first, the sisters are unaware how to perform their job properly, carelessly handling the hazardous materials by throwing them into dumpsters instead of becoming licensed and properly disposing of bio-waste in an incinerator. Needing to operate as a more reputable service, the sisters get the necessary tools from Winston ([[Clifton Collins, Jr.]]), a one-armed storekeeper of a shop for cleanup material. The sisters name their cleanup business "Sunshine Cleaning" and start making progress as their reputation grows. They begin to find meaning in their function to "help" in some way in the aftermath of a loss or disaster, even though the job stirs up memories of their own mother's suicide. At the same time, the members of the family deal with their individual problems. Rose encounters some of her former high school classmates and is embarrassed by the low status of her position in life. After an encounter with Mac's pregnant wife in a gas station, where the cheated-upon wife mocks Rose's post high school life, Rose realizes that Mac will never leave his marriage, and ends their relationship. Norah meets and has a relationship with Lynn, the daughter of a woman whose house they cleaned. Joe (who makes exaggerated promises) begins to sell shrimp independently, hoping to raise enough money to buy a pair of expensive binoculars that Oscar wants for his birthday.  One day, an insurance company calls for the services of Sunshine Cleaning, granting the sisters the potential to obtain breakthrough access to steady lucrative projects. Unfortunately for Rose, a [[baby shower]] is on the same day, with all her more prosperous high school classmates attending. She asks Norah to clean the house alone until she can catch up. Norah bungles her solitary cleaning assignment, as she accidentally burns down the house with an unattended candle. The house burning tarnishes their business reputation and saddles them with a debt of $40,000 which the sisters simply cannot afford.  Sunshine Cleaning goes out of business, and Rose is forced to return to her previous job as a maid. Meanwhile, Joe's shrimp plan goes awry as all the stores and restaurants he approaches refuse to buy from an unlicensed food distributor.  Joe had not realized when he purchased the shrimp that no legitimate business would be willing to accept the health and legal risks involved in buying food from a questionable source.  Lynn breaks off her relationship with Norah as she questions whether Norah was truly interested in her at all.  At Oscar's birthday party, Norah apologizes to Rose, and despite still being mad at her, Rose forgives her. The family and Winston then celebrate Oscar's birthday with Winston, who seems quite taken with Rose.  Sometime later, Rose visits her father who says he's sold his house and explains that with the money, he has started a new cleanup business named Lorkowski Cleaning. He asks Rose to be his more knowledgeable managing partner and she agrees. Norah finally shows independence by going on a road trip to find her new self, while Rose starts working with her father at Lorkowski Cleaning. The movie ends on a positive note, with the implication that Norah has reached a positive turning point in her life and is at peace with herself and that Rose will successfully run her business while also looking after her eccentric father and possibly developing a closer relationship with the quietly supportive Winston.<ref></ref>

They do so to one young couple then let them go.  A bit later, Stephanie, traveling on vacation with her family, sees a car (the couple's) with blood on it and tells it to her oblivious mother ([[Cheri Oteri]]). Bobbi, using drugs with her boyfriend Johnny (Mac Miller), is in a car right behind them. At a rest stop, both girls learn a pair of killers are responsible for a string of murders and likely the woman's disappearance. Stephanie's stepfather Steven ([[Hugh Dillon]]) supposedly speeds and their car's tire is shot by Bennett. Bobbi and Johnny are about to offer help, but the officers arrive and harass all of them, making Steven put Conrad's gun in his mouth and making Bobbi swear at Johnny. After all of this, Stephanie tells the officers about the bloody car she saw earlier. The officers leave to investigate.  Steven gets to work changing the tire, and Bobbi gets out to talk with Stephanie's family, who all feel violated by the officers. Simultaneously, after passing a white van, Bennett and Conrad find the car Stephanie described further down the road, with evidence of an altercation, and race back towards the van. The van plows into the back of Johnny's car, killing him and Steven. A dead man is at the wheel, and a live person, covered in a black bag, is sitting in the passenger seat of the van, whom Bobbi tries to save. Bennett and Conrad arrive back at the scene. In the chaos, Conrad is killed and persons emerge from the van wearing rubber masks, kill Stephanie's mother and brother, and knock Bennett unconscious. Stephanie and Bobbi take refuge in the police car.  Presently, Hallaway and Anderson are trying to figure things out when bodies are discovered in a motel nearby. Anderson takes Wright and Degrasso to the scene, leaving Hallaway with Bobbi, Billings, Bennet, and Stephanie, who whispers something in Hallaway's ear after Anderson leaves. Hallaway talks with the three others, while Degrasso discovers nude pictures of Anderson and Hallaway. Leafing through them in Anderson's backseat, Degrasso is shocked to see the agents with the body of a dead woman. Before he can react, Anderson shoots both Degrasso and Wright dead, then dumps both bodies by the roadside. Hallaway, meanwhile, reveals that he was at the bloodbath earlier, and reveals he and Anderson are in fact the killers. Hallaway kills Billings, and when Anderson returns Bennett and Bobbi are also murdered.

Synecdoche, New York
 Theater director Caden Cotard finds his life unraveling. Suffering from numerous physical ailments and growing increasingly alienated from his wife, Adele, an artist, he hits bottom when Adele leaves him for a new life in Berlin, taking their four-year-old daughter, Olive, with her.  After the success of his production of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', Caden unexpectedly receives a [[MacArthur Fellowship]], which gives him the financial means to pursue his artistic interests. He is determined to use it to create an artistic piece of brutal realism and honesty, something into which he can pour his whole self. Gathering an ensemble cast into an enormous warehouse in Manhattan's [[Theater District]], he directs them in a celebration of the mundane, instructing them to live out their constructed lives. As the mockup inside the warehouse grows increasingly [[mimetic]] of the city outside, Caden continues to look for solutions to his personal crises. He is traumatized as he discovers Adele has become a celebrated painter in Berlin and Olive is growing up under the questionable guidance of Adele's friend Maria. After a disastrous fling with Hazel (the woman who works in the box office), he marries Claire, an actress in his cast, and has a daughter with her. Their relationship ultimately fails, and he continues his awkward relationship with Hazel, who is by now married with children and working as his assistant. Meanwhile, an unknown condition is systematically shutting down his [[autonomic nervous system]].  As the years rapidly pass, the continually expanding warehouse is isolated from the deterioration of the city outside. Caden buries himself ever deeper into his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], blurring the line between reality and the world of the play by populating the cast and crew with [[doppelgänger]]s. For instance, Sammy Barnathan is cast in the role of Caden in the play after Sammy reveals that he has been obsessively following Caden for 20 years, while Sammy's lookalike is cast as Sammy. Sammy's interest in Hazel sparks a revival of Caden's relationship with her, leading Sammy to commit suicide.  As he pushes against the limits of his personal and professional relationships, Caden lets an actress take over his role as director and takes on her previous role as Ellen, Adele's custodian. He lives out his days in the model of Adele's apartment under the replacement director's instruction while some unexplained (and likely in-universe) calamity occurs in the warehouse leaving ruins and bodies in its wake. Finally, he prepares for death as he rests his head on the shoulder of an actress who had previously played Ellen's mother, seemingly the only person in the warehouse still alive. As the scene fades to gray, Caden says that now he has an idea of how to do the play when the director's voice in his ear gives him his final cue: "Die."

Molly runs the household and sees an opportunity on election day to energize her father: frustrated with her father's apathy toward voting, she sneaks into her local polling place and tries to vote on behalf of Bud. However, due to the voting machines being unplugged, the ballot is registered, but no decision is indicated on which candidate gets the vote. The entire election now comes down to this one man's vote. Neither candidate has a majority in the electoral college without New Mexico's electoral votes.  The popular vote is tied for the two major candidates in New Mexico, leaving Bud to decide the next [[President of the United States]].

Bud's actual opinions (or lack thereof) are misinterpreted by the media, causing the candidates to [[Flip-flop (politics)|flip-flop]] on several positions (the Democrats take a [[prolife]] and anti-[[illegal immigration]] stand, while the Republicans take a pro-[[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] and pro-[[gay marriage]] stand). As the film progresses, however, the two candidates are shown to move away from the cynical tactics forced on them by their advisers, and both gain Bud's respect. In the end, he chooses to hold a final debate the day before he is set to recast his ballot. In a written speech, he confesses that he knows little to nothing about politics, or for that matter, life, and decides to ask questions people have sent to him in the mail. The film ends with Bud casting his vote, though for whom he voted is never revealed.

A quick search reveals several heavily drugged girls, including a dead Amanda. Bryan ties Marko into a chair and interrogates him using [[Parrilla (torture)|parrilla]]. Marko reveals that virgins like Kim are sold quickly due to their prized value, and identifies the buyer as Patrice Saint-Clair. Bryan leaves him to die from continuous [[electrocution]] and visits Jean-Claude's apartment that evening. Having discovered Jean-Claude's corruption, Bryan injures the latter's wife to coerce him into disclosing Saint-Clair's location.  Bryan infiltrates a covert sex slave [[auction]] underway beneath Saint-Clair's manor, where Kim is the subject of the last sale. Bryan forces Ali, an [[Arab]] bidder, to purchase her. While making his way out, Bryan is knocked out and chained to a pipe, but manages to escape and eliminate Saint-Clair's henchmen.

  Sailor Pietro and his rat companion Roscuro dock in the kingdom of Dor, famous around the world for its delicious soups, during the "Royal Soup Day." The chief cook, Chef Andre, makes good soup due to Boldo, a magical genie that emerges from his pot and is made entirely out of food. Enchanted by the smell of the delicious soup, Roscuro slips away and ends up in the royal banquet hall, on a chandelier above the royal family's table. He slips and falls into the Queen's soup, giving her such a fright that she has a heart attack and dies.  The entire hall goes into panic, as the guards pursue Roscuro. He attempts to flee the castle but sees Pietro's ship has already sailed away. He narrowly escapes capture by falling down a sewer drain, which leads to the castle dungeons, where he's found and taken in by Botticelli, the leader of the dungeon's large rat population.  Distraught over his wife's death, the king forbids any and all things related to soup and makes rats illegal. Without its soup, Dor becomes impoverished and dreary. Andre is banned from making any more soup and Boldo stops appearing. The king's daughter, Princess Pea, despairs over the sad state of the kingdom and how her father has shut out both her and the world in his grief.  In a mouse village in the castle's abandoned kitchen storage room, a baby is born to the Tilling family. They name him Despereaux. As he grows up, it becomes clear Despereaux's not like other mice: he isn't meek and timid, but brave and curious, unnerving his family, friends, and school teachers. In an effort to teach him to behave like a proper mouse, his brother Furlough takes him to the castle library to show him how to chew books, but Despereaux is more interested in reading than eating them.  He becomes fascinated by fairytale books about daring knights and trapped princesses. One day while reading, he comes across Princess Pea and the two speak. She makes him promise to finish reading the story about the princess so he may tell her how it ends. Upon discovering Despereaux has violated mouse law by talking to a human, his parents turn him in to the mouse council.  The council banishes Despereaux to the dungeons, where he meets and tells the princess' story to the castle jailor, Gregory, but he doesn't listen and leaves Despereaux alone. There, he is captured by the rats and thrown into their arena with a cat. As Despereaux is about to be eaten, Roscuro saves his life by asking Botticelli to give Despereaux to him to eat. Having been unable to adjust to being a sewer rat, Roscuro is desperate to hear about the outside world. The two become friends, as every day Despereaux tells him the stories and of the princess and her sadness.  Hoping to make amends for all the trouble he's caused, Roscuro sneaks up to Princess Pea's room and tries to apologize, but she's frightened by him and lashes out. Hurt by this, Roscuro decides he wants to hurt Pea. He enlists the help of Miggery "Mig" Sow, Princess Pea's slightly deaf young maid who longs to be a princess herself, by convincing her she can take Pea's place if she kidnaps her. After Mig drags Pea down to the dungeons, Roscuro double-crosses her and locks her in a cell.  Meanwhile, Despereaux (who has been punished by the mouse council again for his bravery by learning to be afraid by the threadmaster, Hovis, but after being lost in a cave, the mice thought he was dead) realizes that the princess is in danger, he tries to tell the king but he was too despondent to listen. Despereaux tries to get help elsewhere; he tries to tell his people to help, but they are afraid to see him alive (thinking that he is a ghost.) So Despereaux decides to ring the town's bell to prove to his people that he is still alive. A sleeping Andre heard the bell and dreams of his days before soups were illegal. After dreaming, Andre decided that he had enough of this law and gets back to make some soup, which brings the enchanted smell back to the kingdom and brings back Boldo.  Back in the rat colony, Roscuro sees the apologetic sincerity in Pea's eyes and regrets his actions, but is unable to stop the rats, to whom he has given her, from clambering over her. Roscuro tries to tell the rats that Pea is not bad, but Botticelli does not let him because he wants Pea dead, even going as far as allowing the rats to eat or trample over Pea. Back at the castle, Despereaux tried to get help from Andre and Boldo, but Andre doesn't listen. Boldo, wanting to help, turns into a knight by Despereaux. As for Roscoro, he figures out that Botticelli is a double-crossing traitor and that Pea is doomed. However, Boldo sacrifices himself against the rats to let Despereaux escaped them and lets loose a cat and brings sunshines to the rat world, and the rats run away. As the cat runs back to its cage, Roscuro then forces Botticelli into it, where he is eaten by the cat.  Mig is later reunited with her long-lost father Gregory, who recognizes the heart-shaped birthmark on her neck. It finally stops raining and the sun shines after soup is made for the first time in years. The mice all then try to be braver like Despereaux. The king is able to overcome his grief and soup and rats are allowed back in the kingdom. Roscuro returns to a life at sea, where there is always light and a gentle breeze and Despereaux himself takes off on a journey to see the world as the film ends.

Tear This Heart Out
 The film takes place over the span of several years within the 1930s in Mexico, focusing on the life of Catalina "Catín" Guzmán ([[Ana Claudia Talancón]]), a young girl born to a middle-class family in [[Puebla]]. She meets the cunning General Andrés Ascencio ([[Daniel Giménez Cacho]]) while on an outing with her family and he becomes interested in her, paying her regular visits and lavishing her with gifts and praise. Smitten, she agrees to accompany him to [[Tecolutla]] and loses her virginity to him. At that point she becomes curious about [[sexual activity]], including [[masturbation]]. Despite Andrés's light [[misogyny]] and casual derisions of her age and intelligence whenever offering her opinions on politics and other issues they discuss, she cares for him.  Returning home and having no contact with each other for some days, he arrives at her home one day and proposes marriage to her; she excitedly accepts, despite her family's gentle misgivings about the union due to her age (she is 15). A hint of the true depth of Andrés's sexism is revealed while signing the marriage papers and at a celebratory breakfast for the couple—Andrés stresses his ownership of Catalina to her father and states that he is now in control of her behaviour as the man of the family. She mentions her family and friends' warnings that she will regret marrying a man they perceive to be an untrustworthy and sinister womaniser, a warning she fails to heed—and yet later acknowledges as a regret that came years later.  The couple's movements between Andrés's city home in Puebla and [[hacienda]] mark idyllic times for Catalina; riding in the lands surrounding the hacienda, taking cooking classes, enjoying a rich lifestyle and having frequent sex is what Catalina knows. Despite showing concern over certain issues, such as her husband's plans to flood a valley for an electric dam (thus forcing the relocation of hundreds of impoverished farmers and villagers in the area) and his shady dealings with a neighbour, an [[United States|American]] [[expatriate]] named Mike Heiss, his constant rebukes of her intrusions in his business as a "busybody woman" keep her from forcing the issue, though these stay clearly in her consciousness. His arrest due to accusations of murder give her a taste of the true volatility and uncertainty of being a political wife, despite his release a few days later. Shortly after she discovers that she is pregnant, yet her joy is dampened significantly when she sees him [[Infidelity|embracing another woman]], her first glimpse of his many infidelities. He dismisses her angry chastisement of his actions and she briefly takes on a childhood friend as a [[Sexual partner|lover]] to alleviate her loneliness, as Andrés spends less time with her during her pregnancy. Years pass and another baby is born to them.  Andrés brings two children of his—including a daughter who is 12, only seven years younger than Catalina—to live with them, explaining that they are the product of the union between him and his first wife, a saintly woman who died of [[typhus]] during the [[Mexican Revolution|Revolution]] (Catín comments that their actual mother was alive and well, living in [[Veracruz]]). She believes him and gets along well with the children. At the same time Andrés announces his postulation as Governor of Puebla, a move enthusiastically supported by his family, who accompany him on extensive campaigning trips and witness several speeches to the poorer constituents of the state, promising progress and an improved state.

Terribly Happy
  Copenhagen policeman Robert Hansen [[(Jakob Cedergren)]] has been reassigned by his supervisor [[(Jens Jorn Spottag)]] in Tonder to a temporary post as the sole police officer in the village of Skarrild, situated in a boggy lowland.  Robert was just out of therapy for a breakdown he suffered after threatening his wife and her lover with a gun.  He longs for his stay here to be over quickly so that he can reunite with his daughter, Josefine, who has been told he is in Australia.  In Skarrild, Robert meets some of the unusual locals, Dr. Zerleng [[(Lars Brygmann)]] and his two cronies, the grocer [[(Anders Hove)]] and the priest [[(Henrik Lykkegaard)]], who are looking for him to become the fourth player in their regular card game.  He also meets Ingelise Buhl [[(Lene Maria Christensen)]], a victim of marital abuse, who sets about insinuating herself into Robert's daily life.  Robert also visits the local bicycle shop, but no one is there, and he is told the owner suddenly disappeared some time ago.  Following a few minor incidents, it has become clear to him that the residents prefer to mete out justice in their own way, rather than involve the authorities in Tonder.  In an effort to be protective of Ingelise, Robert developes feelings for her.  After an instance of abuse by her husband, Jorgen [[(Kim Bodnia)]], he goes to her home to check on her.  He enters through an open door, to find Jorgen passed out on the stairs leading up to their bedroom.  He finds Ingelise lying in bed, somewhat battered, and she begins to seduce him.  He succumbs, and when Ingelise's moans threaten to rouse Jorgen, Robert muffles her with a pillow, accidentally suffocating her.  He is able to sneak away without waking Jorgen, who is still on the stairs in a drunken stupor.  The next day, the locals are alerted, and Robert reenters the scene of his mishap to investigate.  When the doctor arrives to examine the body, Robert makes a vague attempt at telling the truth, but is coerced by the doctor, who declares the death is due to cardiac arrest.  He doesn't want the Tonder authorities in on this, even though he believes that Jorgen actually killed his wife, and says he doesn't want their daughter, Dorthe [[(Mathilde Maack)]] left an orphan.  Robert is conflicted and suffers guilt.  As Robert prepares to attend Ingelise's funeral, he realizes he has lost a button from his uniform pocket during their tussle.  At the funeral luncheon, he is advised by the priest to keep an eye on Jorgen because the townsfolk don't like wife-killers, and they all believe that Jorgen is guilty.  That night, Robert parks outside Jorgen's house and in the morning, sees several men in two cars taking him away, and follows them to the outskirts of town, where they are forcing Jorgen at gunpoint to enter the bog.  For the first time, Robert pulls out his pistol, aims it at the men and tells them to desist.  He is then able to get Jorgen out of the bog and takes him home. He finds Dorthe hiding at the grocer's, where she tells him that she saw him leaving her house the night Ingelise died.  He is able to convince her it is a misunderstanding, and takes her back to her father.  Later, Jorgen goes to the bar and challenges Robert to a drinking duel.  After six beers and five shots, the two end up at Robert's apartment, where Jorgen pulls out Robert's missing uniform button.  He has an idea what happened, so Robert goes for the gun in his desk drawer and shoots Jorgen.  He then takes Jorgen's body to the bog.  He drives back to town and falls asleep in his police car.  The next morning, the Tonder chief of police shows up and Robert is taken along to investigate a boot (Jorgen's boot) found in the bog.  Expecting the worst, Robert goes back to his cruiser to await his fate.  He is joined there by the chief of police, who tells him they dredged up the body of the bicycle shop owner, and says that they could just say that Jorgen committed suicide and no one would be the wiser and that Robert could soon be back in Copenhagen at his old job, and close to his daughter.  That would make things simpler.  Robert manages a slight smile at the thought of being out of this place and back home again.  Robert is seen packing his bags and getting ready to leave Skarrild behind.  He stops by at the doctor's ongoing card game to say goodbye, but is told that they know exactly what happened with Ingelise and Jorgen.  They tell him they are glad to be rid of them because it has reduced the tension in the town, and they know things about him that could hurt him in Copenhagen.  The grocer adds, "You're our man now, Robert."  He sits down at the table to become their fourth player.

ThanksKilling
 At the first [[Thanksgiving]] in 1621, a topless [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrim]] is slain with a [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] wielded by an evil demonic turkey, which quips, "Nice tits, bitch!"  Centuries later, five college students (good girl Kristen, [[Jock (athlete)|jock]] Johnny, ditzy Ali, [[redneck]] Billy, and nerdy Darren) head home to Crawl Berg (formerly Crawberg) for Thanksgiving with their families. After Kristen calls her father, the local sheriff, the car overheats, forcing the quintet to camp out for the night. As they are setting up, Darren tells the [[settler]]-era [[Folklore|folktale]] of Feathercloud, a Native American [[Shamanism|shaman]] who was dishonored by hedonistic pilgrim Chuck Langston, one of Billy's ancestors. The outraged Feathercloud used [[necromancy]] to create Turkie, who is said to appear every five-hundred and five years to slaughter all Caucasians he encounters.  Elsewhere, a dog owned by a [[hermit]] named Oscar urinates on a miniature [[totem pole]], desecrating it, and releasing Turkie prematurely. The dog is killed, prompting Oscar to swear vengeance as Turkie runs off, and scares Kristen. Kristen tells the others about her run-in with Turkie, but they laugh off her story, until a baby rabbit (which appears to have been pecked to death) is thrown into their campfire. The next day, Turkie flags down a vehicle, and when the driver sexually propositions him, Turkie responds by shooting the man in the head and hijacking his car. By nightfall, the students reach their respective homes, and while Johnny tries to reconnect with his estranged father, Turkie attacks him. Johnny's parents are killed, but he escapes, and rejoins his friends with the exception of Ali, who is having sex with her boyfriend, Greg. Turkie walks in on the lovers, slits Greg's throat, and rapes Ali before snapping her neck.  After finding Ali's remains, the students decide to go to Kristen's house, to see if her father has any books about Turkie in his library. Turkie beats them there, tricking Kristen's father (who is dressed as a turkey for an upcoming pageant) into letting him in by wearing [[Groucho glasses]]. As they wait for Kristen, Turkie and the sheriff share an awkward snack, which ends when Turkie murders the sheriff after he mistakes him for a duck. Kristen and her friends arrive, and are allowed in by Turkie, who has donned the sheriff's severed face as a disguise. Darren finds a book about Turkie, and it mentions he can be killed if his magic [[talisman]] is removed, though the rest of the passage about how to destroy him is written in code. Billy stumbles onto Turkie disposing of the sheriff's body, and while he and the others succeed in getting the talisman, Turkie gets away.  Billy storms off while Darren cracks the code in the book, discovering that Turkie must be burned at the stake after a demonic prayer is said backwards. Outside, Turkie magically enters Billy's body, and shoots his way out. Billy dies in Darren's arms as they reminisce about all the good times they had together. Darren, Kristen, and Johnny track Turkie to his [[tipi]] and say the prayer, but as they prepare to burn him he runs outside, and is shot in the head by Oscar. Oscar leaves, and the others go to Kristen's house, unaware that the dumpster Turkie was blasted into contains [[radioactive waste]], which reanimates him.  Believing that Turkie is dead, the surviving teens go back to Kristen's house. While Johnny and Kristen admit their feelings for each other, Darren awkwardly goes to the kitchen to get a snack. There, Turkie rips Darren's tongue and heart out, and stabs Johnny with an [[electric knife]]. As Johnny dies, Kristen sets Turkie on fire with an aerosol flamethrower, and knocks him into a pile of wood. Later, at a family's Thanksgiving dinner, the cooked turkey comes to life, and in Turkie's voice yells, "Do I smell sequel, biotch?!"

After Christine returns, the [[quintet]] pick up a hitchhiker in the hope that he can give them directions, but once inside the van the man attacks them with a knife, stabbing two members of the group to death while the others flee. Vanessa reaches a farmhouse, but while searching for aid she is captured by [[Leatherface]], who ties her to a chair, and gags her.  Brent and Christine reach the farmhouse moments later, and are allowed in by the inhabitants, a pair of deranged sisters, one of whom lures Brent into another room. While those two have sex, Christine has a [[threesome]] with the remaining sister, Daisy, and the woman's mute brother, Robbie, believing it to be the only way the siblings will offer them any aid. When Brent climaxes, the sister hacks one of his arms off with a hatchet, gnaws on the severed limb, and taunts him as he dies. As that occurs, Christine passes out on the family's couch, and is awakened hours later by Leatherface, who drags her outside.

And so Kottai journeys to big bad Chennai in company with Vellaiyan ([[Ganja Karuppu]]), who dances with every Karagattam dancer on the roadside, makes lewd jokes and appears to have only one thing on his mind. They end up at the massive home of Kailasam, the local terror who slices up people whenever he can—only, our heroes are unaware of the fact.  Kottai and Vellaiyan thinks that all Kailasam does is cut up trees, which is why he requires their aruvaal-making skills but Kottai gets to know that Kailasam hired him to make sickles to kill people. And so Kottai goes to work. So you have Kottai feeding crying children milk, helping men with epileptic seizures and falling in love with the first fair-complexioned, slim beauty he comes across, Gayatri ([[Poonam Bajwa]]).  Naturally, Gayatri, as the heroine, is also a wonderfully kind-hearted girl, who wears revealing saris, teaches music to students. Kottai's logic for falling in love with her is that she treats him like his own family.  Meantime, there is yet another villain, Santhosh ([[Shafi (actor)|Shafi]]), Kailasam's son, who goes playing musical instruments, mouthing punch lines and raping women left, right and center. There is also a remarkably stupid and one-dimensionally portrayed minister ([[Rajan P. Dev]]) and a helpless, frustrated cop Surya Prakash ([[Sai Kumar (Tollywood actor)|Sai Kumar]]) who simply stands like a rock in uniform and he wants to settle a score with Kailasam because his son raped and killed his sister. Naturally, Santhosh goes on raping women, Surya Prakash goes on standing still; Kottai goes on making aruvaals until Santhosh's catches sight of the ravishing Gayatri, touches her inappropriately and all hell breaks loose. Kottai bashes Santhosh, not knowing that he is the son of Kailasam. When Kailasam comes to know that Kottai has beaten his son to death, he tries to take revenge on Kottai. But Kottai, with the help of Suryaprakash, kills Kailasam and minister. The film ends with Kottai returning to his home.

There's Gonna Be a God Damn Riot in Here
 Dennis Del Torre was a fan of [[Charles Bukowski|Bukowski]] and wanted to bring him to Vancouver for a reading. He wrote to Bukowski and Bukowski agreed, but with certain conditions, including that he receive a copy of any recording. Del Torre hired a video crew from the local college to video tape the event. The video tape was lost, but years later when John Dullaghan was working on his Bukowski documentary ''Born Into This'', he discovered a copy of the tape at the home of the widow Linda Bukowski. The video was restored and a deal was made with Bukowski's widow and mondayMEDIA to turn it into a DVD and distribute it. It turned out to be the penultimate live reading Bukowski ever gave.<ref>[http://community.livejournal.com/ham_on_rye Link to story of reading on Bukowski fan site]</ref>  By 1980 Bukowski's book royalties and movie advances provided him enough of a living that he no longer had to do readings.  Bukowski's readings were known for their riotous back and forth with the audience and this recording shows this in full color. Each poem is set between a tense dialog – with Bukowski giving and taking insults and threats with members of the audience. It ends with the statement that "I'll never do another of these readings", but in fact, he did one more in California in March 1980 – see the film ''[[The Last Straw (film)|The Last Straw]]''.

He soon begins to have nightmares about himself and his family dying as a result of a nuclear terrorist attack. He searches on the internet for "how to protect your family from a terrorist attack". He ends up at a seminar he finds on a website that specializes in providing people with steps to prepare for an attack. There, he meets comedian Tom Arnold, who is also having fears of an attack. He and Arnold end up forming a close relationship later in the film.  Carl begins to clean out his basement and convert it into a [[fallout shelter]]. He fills it with emergency supply items (duct tape, food, water, flashlights, batteries, an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP-proof]] radio, etc.). This worries his wife Viv, who is pregnant. She sends him to a therapist, whom Carl dislikes. Viv is even more worried when Tom takes Carl out to the shooting range at a gun shop, where Carl buys a 9mm Glock pistol.

During a scene when Carl is scanning his shelter for radiation, he sees a high radiation count in a plate he obtained from a homeless man earlier in the film. He returns the plate to him, however the man does not believe him and gives him a card to a mental health clinic. In one scene, Carl goes to a comedy club where Tom is performing, and hears Tom joking about him. He feels betrayed, and avoids contact with Tom.  Carl soon begins to believe that America is a dangerous place, and he searches for a home in British Columbia. This leads to Viv and him being separated. Carl buys the new house and says goodbye to his wife when she is heading to work. Just as Carl is packing, Tom calls him, and apologizes for his stage performance. He then tells Carl that one of his friends deep in the government reported that bomb disposal units have been dispatched to downtown L.A., where an armed [[suitcase nuke]] had been found. Tom has saved two seats in a jet for him and Viv to escape from the impending attack. Carl agrees to go along and gets his dog, and then tries to warn Viv. She does not believe him and hangs up on him. Carl then calls his students and warns them to take shelter.  The [[Emergency Alert System]] comes on the air and broadcasts an EAN warning of the terrorist attack. Carl calls Viv again, who now believes him but cannot leave because she is working the crisis at City Hall. He shows up at the airport, and tells Tom he's not going. He gives Tom his dog and drives to the government building to find Viv and take shelter. With two minutes left until the bomb detonates, he finds her working the 911 service. When he tells Viv to go to the shelter with him, she expresses concerns about the people needing help. In the last seconds before detonation, Viv and Carl say they love each other one last time. The explosion is not shown, however Carl gives an afterword.

 Tinker Bell ([[Mae Whitman]]) is born from the first laugh of a baby, and is brought by the winds to [[Pixie Hollow]] (which is part of the island of Never Land). She learns that her talent is to be one of the tinkers, the fairies who make and fix things. Two other tinker fairies, Bobble ([[Rob Paulsen]]) and Clank ([[Jeff Bennett]]), teach her their craft, and tell her about the fairies who visit the mainland to bring each season. Tinker Bell is thrilled and cannot wait to go to the mainland for spring.  While out working, she meets Silvermist ([[Lucy Liu]]), a water fairy; Rosetta ([[Kristin Chenoweth]]), a garden fairy; Iridessa ([[Raven-Symoné]]), a light fairy; and Fawn ([[America Ferrera]]), an animal fairy. After meeting them, she notices Vidia ([[Pamela Adlon]]), a fast-flying fairy who immediately dislikes her because of her unusually strong talent. Vidia challenges her to prove she will be able to go to the mainland, and Tinker Bell creates several inventions, which she shows to the Minister of Spring ([[Steve Valentine]]). But Tinker Bell soon learns from Queen Clarion ([[Anjelica Huston]]) that only nature-talent fairies visit the mainland.  She tries her hand at nature skills; making dewdrops with Silvermist, lighting fireflies with Iridessa, and trying with Fawn to teach baby birds to fly, but she fails miserably at all of these. Meanwhile, Bobble and Clank cover for Tinker Bell when questioned by Fairy Mary ([[Jane Horrocks]]), the tinker fairy overseer. When Tinker Bell returns, she tries to explain, but Mary simply responds that she knows, and expresses her disappointment with Tinker Bell's actions.  On the beach, Tinker Bell finds parts of a music box and figures out how to put them together. Iridessa, Fawn, Silvermist, and Rosetta witness her doing this, then tell her that she was tinkering and that she should be proud of her talent—if this is what she's good at, the mainland should not matter. But Tinker Bell still wants to go to the mainland. She asks Rosetta if she will still teach her to be a garden fairy, but Rosetta says she thinks that tinkering is Tinker Bell's talent.  As a last resort, Tinker Bell asks Vidia for help in becoming a garden fairy. Vidia craftily tells her that capturing the sprinting thistles would prove her worth. However, once she sees Tinker Bell making progress, she lets the captured thistles loose, and in attempting to recapture them, Tinker Bell destroys all the preparations for spring. Tinker Bell decides to leave, but after talking with the light-keeper, Terence ([[Jesse McCartney]]), about how important his job is, she realizes the importance of a tinker.  Tinker Bell redeems herself by inventing machines that quicken the process of decorating flowers, ladybugs, etc. This allows the other fairies to get back on schedule, thus saving the arrival of spring. Vidia is punished for prompting her to cause the chaos, and Queen Clarion allows Tinker Bell to join the nature-talent fairies when they bring spring to the mainland. Tinker Bell is given the task of delivering the music box to its original owner (shown to be [[Wendy Darling]]). The narrator ends by saying that when lost toys are found or a broken clock starts to work, "it all means that one very special fairy might be near."

Unfortunately Akemi's demanding boyfriend grows weary of Akemi's house guests leading Hiroko to hit the streets of Tokyo in search of another suitable apartment. Hiroko only managed to find a series of rat-infested hovels that neither she nor Akira can afford on their limited salaries. After Akira's film screens to dubious acclaim, one spectator informs Hiroko of the inherent struggles in relationships between creative types: often, one half of the couple would feel invisible, useless, or unappreciated. Hiroko relates to these feelings wholeheartedly in the wake of her numerous trials and tribulations in the unfamiliar city of Tokyo, and starts to question her role in the relationship. Hiroko wakes up one morning and sees a small hole where light is going through her. When she goes to the bathroom and unbuttons her shirt, she's shocked to see a hand sized hole in her chest with a wooden pole down the middle. As she walks down the street, the hole gets bigger and stumbling as both her feet turn to wooden poles. Eventually Hiroko is turned into a chair, only her jacket is left hanging on the back. People walking past are unmindful of the chair's presence.  === "Merde" === Directed by [[Léos Carax]].  Merde (French for "shit") is the name given to an unkempt, gibberish-spewing subterranean creature of the Tokyo sewers, played by [[Denis Lavant]], who rises from the underground lair where he dwells to attack unsuspecting locals in increasingly brazen and terrifying ways. He steals cash and cigarettes from passersby, frightens old women and salaciously licks schoolgirls, resulting in a televised media frenzy that creates mounting hysteria among the Tokyo populace. After discovering an arsenal of hand grenades in his underground lair, Merde slips into full-on assault mode, hurling the munitions at random citizens and creating a Godzilla-like atmosphere of urban terror, which the media promptly laps up and reflects back to its equally voracious television audience. Enter pompous French magistrate Maître Voland ([[Jean-François Balmer]]) — a dead ringer for the sewer creature's gnarled and twisted demeanor — who arrives in Tokyo to represent Merde's inevitable televised trial, claiming to be one of only three in the world able to speak his client's unintelligible language. The media circus mounts as lawyer defends client in a surreal court of law hungry for a satisfying resolution. Merde is tried, convicted and sentenced to death — until justice takes an unexpected turn.  === "Shaking Tokyo" === Directed by [[Bong Joon-ho]].  [[Teruyuki Kagawa]] stars as a Tokyo shut-in, or [[hikikomori]], who has not left his apartment in a decade. His only link to the outside world is through his telephone, which he uses to command every necessity from a series of random and anonymous delivery people, including the pizza that he orders every Saturday and the hundreds of discarded pizza cartons he meticulously stacks in and around his cramped apartment, along with books, cardboard tubes from toilet paper. But one day is different — his pizza arrives thanks to a lovely young woman ([[Yū Aoi]]) who succeeds in catching the shut-in's eye. Suddenly an earthquake strikes Tokyo, prompting the beautiful young delivery woman to faint in her client's apartment, causing the hikikimori to fall hopelessly in love. Time passes and the shut-in discovers through another pizza delivery person that the improbable object of his affections has become a hikikimori in her own right. Taking a bold leap into the unknown, our hero crosses the threshold of his apartment and takes to the streets in search of his mystery girl, at last discovering his kindred spirit at the very moment another earthquake strikes.  
Tolerantia
  The hero of the story awakes after a long sleep, at the end of the last [[ice age]]. His reasoning is not something you should be envious of, but he is capable of starting something big...  
Tokyo Gore Police
 The film is set in a near future chaotic [[Japan]]. A [[mad scientist]] known as "Key Man" ([[Itsuji Itao]]) has created a virus that mutates humans into monstrous creatures called "Engineers" that sprout bizarre weapons from any injury. The Tokyo Police Force has been privatized to deal with this new threat of engineers, so a special squad of officers called "Engineer Hunters" are created to deal with them. However, unlike the average police force, the Engineer Hunters are a private [[:wikt:quasi-|quasi-]][[military]] force that utilize violence, [[Sadomasochism|sadism]], and streetside executions to maintain law and order.  Helping the police force is Ruka ([[Eihi Shiina]]), a troubled loner who is very skilled in dispatching the Engineers. Along with helping the police, she is looking for the killer of her father, an old-fashioned officer who was murdered in broad daylight by a mysterious assassin. Ruka soon receives a new case to hunt down Key Man, but once she encounters him, he infects her by inserting a key-shaped [[tumor]] into her scar-riddled left forearm before disappearing. Meanwhile, a police officer (Yukihide Benny) becomes infected while visiting a strip-club filled with Engineers and massacres the main precinct, causing the Tokyo police commissioner ([[Shun Sugata]]) to order a city-wide crackdown on Engineers — indiscriminately executing anyone suspected of being one.  While continuing her investigation, Ruka visits Key Man's home, where he reveals the truth about their past. His father was a police [[sniper]] who resigned after a sniping operation gone wrong. Desperate to keep his family out of poverty, he was paid to assassinate Ruka's father, who was leading a rally against the privatization of the police force. But shortly after gunning down Ruka's father before her eyes, he was murdered by the police commissioner — the real mastermind of the assassination — in front of Key Man. Swearing to avenge his father's death, he injected himself with the [[DNA]] of several infamous criminals, mutating him into his present form. After realizing that she and Key Man are seeking vengeance on the same man, Ruka slices him in half with her [[katana]] before heading back to the precinct. On her way, she witnesses the police force brutalizing civilians accused of being Engineers. When her bar owner friend (Ikuko Sawada) is [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawn and quartered]], Ruka's left arm mutates into an alien-like head with razor-sharp claws before she beheads the officers behind the execution. During her rampage, she is shot in the right eye, but her body quickly replaces it with a [[cybernetic]] eye. She confronts the police commissioner, who admits to her father's assassination, but explains that he raised her to become the perfect Engineer Hunter as atonement. Following a gruelling sword fight, Ruka dismembers and eventually decapitates the commissioner — effectively bringing down his reign on the police force.  During the end credits, it is revealed that Key Man is still alive, having mended himself back into one piece with the help of one of his test subjects.

 The film starts with the 1st encounter happening between Deepak(Sabyasachi) and Jyoti(Rupali).The scene has been narrated in a very genuine way.The romance that eventually blossoms between the two characters Deepak and Jyoti with the violin sessions and Deepak coming up for Jyoti s safeguard have been handled very delicately in the film.The scenes looks very romantic and yet very classy.The Introduction scene of Pupinder justifies his colourful character of "Suraj" portrayed in the film.The fast half of the Movie is almost flawless with proper pace and the movie continues almost with a single flow without much constraints but however post Interval the Movie becomes almost predictable and it seems like an Old Wine in a New Bottle.Sometimes the pace of the movie tends to get slower specially after when Deepak becomes aware of his Friend s Love interest and attempts to make his love to get sacrificed for his friend Suraj s happiness.  
Tokyo Sonata
 ''Tokyo Sonata'' is about a middle-class family in Tokyo, the Sasakis, which consists of Ryūhei Sasaki, his wife Megumi, and their two sons Takashi and Kenji.  Ryūhei has a good office job, but is suddenly fired because Chinese workers are cheaper. While attempting to find a new job, Ryūhei encounters an old classmate on the street, Kurosu, who has also recently been downsized. Kurosu uses a feature on his mobile phone that plays the ring tone periodically, so that it may fool others into believing he is still employed. This intrigues Ryūhei, who decides to hide the fact that he has been fired from his family. While the two men hopelessly try to find new work, Kurosu's wife slowly begins to suspect her husband's unemployment. Kurosu is later found dead together with his wife from gas poisoning in a double suicide, thought to be initiated by Kurosu.  Takashi, the oldest son, joins the US military and is deployed to war in the Middle East. Kenji, the younger son, wishes to learn to play the piano, even though his father refuses to allow him piano lessons. Kenji takes lessons secretly, and pays for them using his lunch money. Gradually, Kenji develops a strong relationship with his piano teacher, Miss Kaneko, who urges him to pursue his musical ambitions. When his parents find out about Kenji's secret piano lessons, Megumi, who is generally closer to the children, is supportive, but Ryūhei is so furious that he attacks his son, accidentally causing him a minor concussion.  One day, Megumi, while alone at home, is taken hostage by an unemployed man who broke in looking for money. The robber forces Megumi to drive a car he has stolen previously. After a long drive, he allows her leave the car to use the restroom where she has the opportunity to escape. However, she encounters her husband at the mall working in his secret job as a janitor and decides to return to her captor saying that she cannot return home.  That night, Megumi, Ryūhei, and Kenji all have experiences away from home in which they confront the full extent of their existential disquiet.  Kenji attempts to help a friend run away from home, but the latter is caught by his father. Kenji tries to leave town by sneaking onto a bus, but he is caught. Unwilling to answer the questions of the police, Kenji is charged as an adult and kept in a group cell overnight. He is released the following day when the charges are dismissed.  Megumi and the burglar drive to the beach together, where they spend the night in a wood shed. Megumi resigns to the robber's sexual advances, but he ultimately is unable to go through with the act itself. Megumi consoles the robber that he is not a failure, saying that he is the only person who can be himself. Later that night, as the robber sleeps, Megumi spots a strange light on the horizon over the sea. She goes out to look for the light and falls asleep on the beach. The next morning, the robber has driven the stolen car into the ocean, and Megumi returns home.  Meanwhile, as he cleans the bathrooms at the mall where he works, Ryūhei discovers an envelope stuffed with cash behind one of the toilets. He pockets it and encounters Megumi while fleeing the bathrooms, from whom he runs away. Ryūhei then despairingly wanders into the Tokyo night, is hit by a truck, and left for dead. He lies on the side of the street amid some leaves and sleeps there overnight, only to find himself waking up in the morning unharmed. He deposits the envelope of cash in a local lost-and-found bucket, and is the last to arrive back at the house, where the three family members share a meal together without mentioning the events of the previous night.  Four months later, Ryūhei appears to be engaged in his cleaning job. Takashi sends a letter home from the field, noting that he has realized that the U.S military is not the only right side and that he will stay in the America to search his happiness there. The final scene depicts Kenji performing "[[Clair de lune (Debussy)|Clair de Lune]]" from the [[Suite bergamasque]] at his audition with Megumi, Ryūhei, and his piano teacher watching. His performance is flawless.

 An American couple, Roy ([[Woody Harrelson]]) and Jessie ([[Emily Mortimer]]), take the train from [[Beijing]] to [[Moscow]] as an adventurous side trip on their return home from a [[Christian mission]] in [[People's Republic of China|China]]. The gregarious Roy befriends their cabin mates, a [[Spain|Spanish]] man, Carlos ([[Eduardo Noriega (Spanish actor)|Eduardo Noriega]]), travelling with his young [[Seattle]]-born girlfriend, Abby ([[Kate Mara]]). The reserved Jessie does not share her husband's warmth towards the globe trotting pair. In course of the journey, Carlos shows Jessie a collection of "rare" [[Matryoshka doll|souvenir matryoshka dolls]] he is carrying.  When Roy misses the train in [[Irkutsk]] while sightseeing, Jessie is left alone with Carlos and Abby. Jessie gets off the train at [[Ilansky (town)|Ilanskaya station]], about 800 miles further, to wait for Roy to arrive in another train. Carlos and Abby get off with her, claiming she would not be safe alone. In a restaurant, Jessie sees dolls nearly identical to the ones that Carlos showed her. Abby is upset when she mentions this and goes off to bed. Jessie begs Carlos not to involve Abby in his suspicious activities.  The next morning Carlos comes to Jessie's room, tells her that his shower is not working and asks to use her bathroom. Jessie receives a call from the reception desk and leaves Carlos alone in her room. At the reception she later receives a telephone call confirming that Roy will rejoin her at 4 o'clock, and Carlos convinces her to accompany him on a trek into the middle of a snowy wilderness, where they come upon the ruins of an abandoned church.  Jessie, an amateur photographer, starts taking pictures of the old church. When Carlos makes advances at first she refuses but then she surrenders. The two begin kissing, but she has a change of heart and asks him to stop. He continues and becomes aggressive and chases her. She becomes terrified and beats him to death with a fence post. She waits until the body is cold and then returns to the [[railway station]] and rejoins Roy on the train.  Ilya Grinko ([[Ben Kingsley]]), an inquisitive Russian narcotics officer whom Roy previously befriended, is the new cabin mate of Roy and Jessie. Jessie finds Carlos' dolls in her own suitcase and realizes that Carlos must have hidden them when he was in her room that morning. In the course of a conversation with Grinko about his police work, Jessie realizes that Carlos was smuggling [[heroin]] in the dolls, and she unsuccessfully tries to get rid of them. She panics when Grinko becomes suspicious and confronts her. When she returns to her cabin to find Roy examining the dolls, she breaks down and explains their origins to Roy, though without telling him about Carlos' death. The two of them surrender the dolls to Grinko, who at first seems satisfied that they were not involved in the smuggling operation.  The next morning, she and Roy awake to discover that most of the train's cars are now gone along with the passengers; only Grinko and his partner Kolzak Yushenkov ([[Thomas Kretschmann]]) remain. Grinko and Kolzak stop the train in the middle of nowhere and take Jessie and Roy to an abandoned military bunker, where Abby is being tortured. Grinko is on the payroll of a Russian drug lord and explains that, in addition to the heroin, he wants the money that Carlos carried, which belongs to the drug lord. Grinko tells Jessie that Abby is not a "good girl" as Jessie had thought: Abby recruited Carlos, was responsible for another man's death and is trying to cheat the drug lord of his money. Jessie disbelieves Grinko because Carlos told her Abby was innocent.  Jessie and Roy manage to escape from the abandoned military bunker and return to the train, where they find the train conductor, who works for Grinko. Roy beats and kills the train's conductor. Jessie and Roy escape with the train because Roy, a [[railfan|railway enthusiast]], knows how to operate a locomotive. The train starts to slow down and Grinko and Kolzak are able to re-board the train. When the pair question Jessie once again about Carlos' whereabouts, while holding her and Roy at gunpoint, Jessie comes clean and screams that she killed Carlos. Kolzak does not believe her, but before they can do anything else, the train has a head-on collision with a troop-carrying train. With the army on the way, Grinko shoots Kolzak to maintain his cover that he is on the right side of the law, claiming to have rescued Jessie and Roy from Kolzak. The couple are taken away by the army, while Grinko escapes.  In [[Moscow]], U.S. officials visit Jessie and Roy. Through a photograph Jessie took of Grinko and his associates, the officials believe it will be easy to shut down the drug operation. They reveal Carlos' criminal history and believe Abby just got mixed up with the wrong crowd. When signing statements, Jessie never tells the officials that she killed Carlos, although Roy may have heard her admit to this when the train was about to crash. Upon touring Moscow and seeing a billboard of a girl sitting on the end of a dock (similar to a scene Abby described earlier as her dream home), Jessie insists on talking to Abby in the hospital. Although off-camera, it is implied that Jessie tells Abby where Carlos' body is.  The final scene shows a still-limping Abby finding Carlos' body in the snow by the old church. She looks at his face. Earlier, she had revealed to Jessie that she was "working" on finding money to buy back her grandfather's cottage on the lake in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]]. She takes the stolen money from his jacket and walks away.  
Transporter 3
 A ship arrives, carrying toxic chemicals that have killed two of its crew members. Frank Martin and Inspector Tarconi fish in the [[Marseille]]s when Tarconi receives a call about a black [[Audi A8]] that has sped past French customs and evaded the police in a car chase. While Tarconi returns to headquarters to give Frank's alibi, in [[Odessa]], Ukraine, the Environmental Agency Minister, Leonid Tomilenko, receives a threat from Ecocorp boss Johnson to reopen business negotiations.  At night, the Audi crashes into Frank's home, with a wounded transporter, Malcolm Melville, whom Frank had referred when he declined a previous job. As paramedics take away Malcolm, Frank discovers a woman in the back seat of the Audi who warns him not to take her from the car – she shows him a metal bracelet she and Malcolm have been wearing. Frank rushes outside, but the ambulance explodes, killing Malcolm. Frank is then knocked out by one of Johnson's henchmen.  Johnson places an explosive bracelet on Frank, forcing him to take a package and the woman, Valentina, to [[Budapest]]. Tomilenko negotiates to postpone signing Ecocorp's agreement that would allow the ship with the chemicals into his country. While Tarconi researches into Johnson's motivations, Frank goes off-course, visiting a garage to try to deal with the bracelet, but as he fends off Johnson's men, his mechanic friend Otto cannot disarm the device on the car. At Budapest, Johnson tells Frank that he's fired. One of Johnson's men steals the Audi, leaving Frank to chase him down.  After Frank and Johnson agree to call it even, Johnson sends him to [[Bucharest]], but Frank and Valentina are chased by a black [[Mercedes-Benz W211|Mercedes-Benz E-Class]] driven by Tomilenko's agents. After opening the package in the trunk, Frank realizes Valentina is the real package. She then seduces Frank by holding his car keys. They have sexual relations. Valentina, who is revealed to be Tomilenko's daughter, explains that she was drugged in Ibiza and was transported by Malcolm in order for Johnson to blackmail her father.  Johnson redirects him to Odessa, where he and his men surround them on a bridge. Although Valentina is delivered to Johnson and her bracelet removed, Johnson's men shoot at Frank's car. Frank drives off the bridge into the lake, fooling Johnson into believing that he is dead whilst surviving by using the air from the car's tires to inflate a buoying device.  Aboard the train, Johnson lets Tomilenko talk to Valentina and gives him 15 minutes to sign the contract. After Tarconi and the Ukrainian police retrieve Frank and the Audi, Frank continues his chase and jumps the car on top of the train containing Johnson and his men. He takes out all of Johnson's men but cannot touch Johnson because he is too far from his car.  After Johnson separates the train cabs, Frank jumps his car into the cab, and beats Johnson; strapping him with the bracelet and sending his car into reverse resulting in Johnson being blown into pieces. Upon hearing from Tarconi that Valentina is safe, Tomilenko tears up the Ecocorp contracts before heading for his business conference. The cargo ship is raided by police and sent away from Ukrainian shores.  Frank and Tarconi return to fishing in Marseilles – Valentina suggests they eat out instead.  
Train (film)
 In Eastern Europe, a group of US college athletes unknowingly board a train that will become one deadly ride. The students are participating in a wrestling championship; they include Todd (Derek Magyer) and his girlfriend Alex (Thora Birch), Sheldon (Kavan Reece), Claire (Gloria Votsis), and young assistant coach Willy (Gideon Emery). After a hard match, they sneak away from their hotel to an underground club. However, the next morning, they return too late for their train to Odessa.   Coach Harris (Todd Jensen) has stayed behind to wait for them. At the station, a woman named Dr. Velislava (Koina Ruseva) approaches and explains that train tickets are normally purchased after one has boarded. The coach and team members join her in boarding the train. Two workers from the train take their passports, and later burn them.   In the dinner car, the coach is joined by the doctor, who flirts with him. They go to his room to have sex, but she injects him with a tranquilizer. In the following scene, the coach is seen in a torture chamber, screaming as he is stitched in the abdomen. Meanwhile, the 4 students and the assistant coach drink and play a game truth or dare.  Todd gets dared to run down to the end of the train and back in his underwear. He reaches the end of the train and is found by one of the workers who charges at him and captures him. Todd is strung up, has his ribcage broken open, spine severed and eyes removed.  Dr. Velislava is then seen fetching a mother who has a son with what appears to be severe [[glaucoma]] in his left eye.  The next morning, upon finding Todd still missing, the remaining students and assistant coach Willy start looking for the missing members of their group.  While searching, Sheldon is attacked by the two demented workers, who drag him to the torture car.  Dr. Veliskava opens the window to the torture car and allows a middle-aged man to view Sheldon's genitalia, upon his approval, Sheldon's genitalia are cut off without any anesthesia which causes him to blackout.  In the next scene he is shown passed out as he is being stitched back up. Claire reaches the end cart and finds the burnt remains of the passports.  She is caught looking for more information and is hooked by the mouth and dragged to the chamber. Willy and Alex find the torture chamber where Todd is vivisected and Sheldon is alive in a cage. They free him and when they see Todd is still breathing, Sheldon kills him out of mercy. Just then, the torturer arrives dragging in Claire. Willy and Alex escape, chased by the torturer, but Sheldon and Claire are left behind. Alex and Willy are caught by the doctor; they realize all the other passengers are transplant patients, and tourists are being harvested for organs.   Back in the torture car, Claire is still alive despite having a huge iron hook driven through her jaw. She, Alex, and Willy watch in horror as Sheldon is vivisected and his heart pulled out. While the captors go to another car to perform the transplant, Alex manages to escape and hide in a sleeper compartment. The next morning, at a military checkpoint, the conductor drags Claire off the train to give to the platoon as a bribe. The passengers (including Alex) watch the platoon take Claire (who, to judge by her screams, is being sexually assaulted) as the train pulls away.   That night the train reaches what appears to be a huge medieval hospital. Alex, disguised, sneaks off into the building, and soon finds Willy, horribly injured but still alive, chained to a bed. They escape into the woods. In the morning, Alex leaves Willy behind briefly, but then from a distance she sees him brutally murdered by the torturers from the hospital.   Now determined, she returns to the train, still parked near the hospital and about to pull away to its next destination. Alex kills each of her torturers, douses the train with gasoline and sets it ablaze, and decouples the last car, which slows to a stop. As she stops to look over the bridge, she's attacked by one of the surviving torturers. After a struggle, she manages to subdue him. When he wakes up, he finds himself strapped to the train tracks. Moments later, a train runs over him. Alex escapes down the tracks, and in the last scene, we see her some time later, about to enter a wrestling match with grim confidence.

The Tour (film)
 In December 1993, as the [[Bosnian War]] rages, Stanislav, an actor living in [[Belgrade]], convinces members of a theater troupe to perform with him at the front lines. Desperate for money, the troupe, consisting of Miško, Sonja, Zaki, Lale, and Jadranka, accept the offer.  The troupe arrives in a derelict town occupied by the [[Army of Republika Srpska]]. The troupe puts on a satirical comedy performance which is booed by the soldiers. The local commander pressures them to hand over their earnings to the local [[Serbs]], and to stage a [[Serbian nationalist]] performance to boost morale. This performance ends disastrously when Lale is beaten up by drunken soldiers. Fed up with Stanislav over his false promises, the troupe decides to leave early but cannot locate their driver, Djuro. They trek through the surrounding combat zone looking for transportation, traversing a minefield in the process, but are captured by [[Croatian Defence Council|HVO]] militiamen. Sonja, a [[Croatian Serb]], tries to fool the soldiers into thinking they are [[Croats]] by performing a scene from a [[Croatian nationalist]] piece, but their commander sees through their ruse. As the Croatian troops prepare to force them back across the minefield, a Serbian paramilitary unit (obvious reference to [[Arkan's Tigers]]) surrounds and captures the Croats. The troupe is forced to watch helplessly as the paramilitary commander (himself a devout fan of the actors) forces the captured soldiers to march to their deaths in the minefield. Back at the town, Misko encounters and old friend from Belgrade, Ljubić. Ljubić offers to bring them along with him back to Belgrade the following day, and even provides them with accommodation at the local hotel. They are unceremoniously thrown out after a drunken Zaki insults the wife of the hotelier, Danilo. The troupe spend the night in Djuro's bus. The next day, Ljubić, working as a propagandist, informs them that he must first deliver a speech to troops in [[Derventa]]. En route, Lale accosts Ljubić for espousing nationalist rhetoric, and tells him that the whole world recognizes the actions of the Serbs as evil. A scuffle ensues when Ljubić calls Lale a [[fascist]], and Djuro loses control of the bus, which crashes in the middle of the forest. As they ponder their next move, they are surrounded by [[ARBiH]] soldiers. Ljubić is taken away to his presumed execution after the commander recognizes him from a nationalist speech he gave on television. After Jadranka performs a compelling [[monologue]], the commander offers them safe passage to Belgrade. The troupe finally return to Belgrade. They try to relax and enjoy a group dinner in their theater, but the awkward and unpleasant atmosphere remains.

Tropic Thunder
 Hook-handed [[Vietnam veteran]] Staff Sergeant John "Four Leaf" Tayback's memoir, ''Tropic Thunder'', is being made into a film. With the exception of newcomer, supporting actor Kevin Sandusky, the cast—fading [[action hero]] Tugg Speedman, five-time [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning Australian [[Method acting|method actor]] Kirk Lazarus, rapper Alpa Chino, and drug-addicted comedian Jeff Portnoy—all cause problems for rookie director Damien Cockburn, who cannot control them, resulting in a million-dollar pyrotechnics scene being wasted. The project is months behind schedule. Furious studio executive Les Grossman orders Cockburn to resume filming as planned, or have the project shut down.  On Four Leaf's advice, Damien drops the actors into the middle of the jungle, with hidden cameras and rigged special effects explosions to film "[[Guerrilla filmmaking|guerrilla-style]]". The actors have guns that fire [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]], along with a map and scene listing that will lead to a helicopter waiting at the end of the route. Unknown to the actors and production, the group have been dropped in the middle of the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]], the home of the [[heroin]]-producing Flaming Dragon gang. Just as the group are about to set off, Damien inadvertently steps on an old land mine and is blown up, stunning the actors. Tugg, believing Damien faked his death to encourage the cast to give better performances, assures the others that Damien is alive, and that they are still shooting the film. Kirk is unconvinced but joins them in their trek through the jungle.  When Four Leaf and [[pyrotechnics]] operator Cody Underwood try to locate the dead director, they are captured by Flaming Dragon. Four Leaf is revealed to have hands; he confesses to Underwood that he actually served in the Coast Guard, has never left the United States, and that he wrote his "memoir" as "a tribute". As the actors continue through the jungle, Kirk and Kevin discover that Tugg is leading them in the wrong direction. The resulting argument results in Kirk leading the rest of the cast as an increasingly delirious Tugg is captured by Flaming Dragon. Taken to their base, Tugg believes it is a [[Prisoner-of-war camp|POW camp]] from the script. The gang discovers he is the star of their favorite film, the [[box office bomb]] ''Simple Jack'', and force him to reenact it several times a day.  Meanwhile, in [[Los Angeles]], Tugg's agent Rick 'Pecker' Peck confronts Les over an unfulfilled term in Tugg's contract that entitles him to a [[TiVo]]. Flaming Dragon calls during the discussion and demands a ransom for Tugg, but Les instead delivers a profanity-laden death threat. Despite the threats, Les expresses no interest in rescuing Tugg and is instead happy at  the insurance payout that would happen if Tugg dies.  He attempts to convince Pecker to play along by promising a [[Gulfstream V]] jet and "lots of money".  Kirk, Alpa, Jeff, and Kevin discover Flaming Dragon's heroin factory. After witnessing Tugg being [[torture]]d, they plan a rescue attempt based on the film's script. Kirk impersonates a farmer towing a "captured" Jeff on the back of a [[water buffalo]], distracting the armed guards so Alpa and Kevin can infiltrate and find the prisoners, but a combination of broken Chinese and inconsistencies in his story sets off the gang's boss. The actors, knowing their cover has been blown, begin firing, fooling gang members into surrender. Their control of the gang falls apart when Jeff grabs the leader and heads for the drugs, and the gang, realizing the guns fire blanks, recover their guns and fight back.  The four actors locate Four Leaf, Cody, and Tugg and cross a bridge rigged to explode to get to Underwood's helicopter. Tugg initially remains behind, believing Flaming Dragon to be his "family", but runs back screaming, chased by an angry horde. Four Leaf destroys the bridge, rescuing Tugg, but as the helicopter takes off, the gang boss fires a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] at the helicopter. Rick unexpectedly stumbles out of the jungle carrying a TiVo box and throws it in the path of the grenade, saving them. The crew return to [[Hollywood]], where footage from the hidden cameras is compiled into a feature film, ''Tropic Blunder'', which becomes a major critical and commercial success. The film wins Tugg his first Academy Award, which Kirk presents to him at the ceremony. During the end credits, Grossman dances alone to [[Ludacris]]' "[[Get Back (Ludacris song)|Get Back]]".

When Tru first starts at her new school, teachers welcome her but a group of male [[jock (athlete)|football jocks]] and their female friends bully her and say she looks like a "[[Dyke (slang)|dyke]]." One of the footballers, Lodell, changes his mind about her and they start dating, but the relationship never becomes sexual. When they attend ''[[The Marvelous Wonderettes]]'' musical, Lodell flirts with a man. Tru's fathers suggest that Lodell is gay, and when Tru questions him he finally, reluctantly admits that he is a [[the closet|closeted]] homosexual. She tells him that she "doesn't want to be his [[Katie Holmes]]" but agrees to be his [[Beard (companion)|beard]] so he can continue to be accepted at school.  Tru begins to spend time with Lodell's best friend, fellow footballer Manuel, but when he bullies openly gay classmate Walter, Tru defends Walter and they become friends. They try to establish a [[Gay Straight Alliance]] and although a conservative teacher and a [[The closet|closeted]] English teacher refuse to support the group, the school drama teacher agrees to be the faculty sponsor. The first meeting is successful, with several people attending a long discussion on [[same-sex marriage in California]], but during football practice at the same time, the coach calls the players "ladies," rants that "kids can't even say prayers in class, but the [[faggot (slang)|fags]]...get their own club!" He then asks his team if they want to "put a little muscles into these plays or go meet [their] boyfriends at the Gay Scouts of America," to which they answer that they want to "play ball."  At the end of the Gay Straight Alliance meeting Tru meets a gay-rights supporter, [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]]-[[geek]] senior Trevor. She initially thinks he's gay, but they quickly form an intimate relationship. Raised by his [[LGBT literature|gay fiction]]-author uncle, Trevor is open-minded about Tru's family arrangement. Later, Tru discovers that Lodell and Walter are sexually involved, and she ends her faux-relationship with Lodell. When Lodell and his teammates destroy a Gay Straight Alliance banner, Trevor sends out a mass [[coming out]] e-mail from Lodell's account. Tru is upset by this but eventually forgives him.  Tru's mothers have a small backyard commitment ceremony attended by teachers and other locals. Lodell arrives to announce that he has left another faux-relationship, and he has the opportunity to reconcile with Walter and meet [[David Kopay]]. Manuel arrives with his football coach and punches Lodell for not revealing his sexuality. He refuses to accept homosexuality, but promises to continue being a friend to Lodell. Lodell performs a self-penned song, the school principal dances with Trevor's uncle, and the closeted English teacher is advised by friend and fellow teacher Ms. Maple ([[Jane Lynch]]) to be open about his sexuality. In the short final scene, Lodell comes out to his mother and grandmother and introduces Walter as his boyfriend.

True Women for Sale
 The story revolves around two women in the [[grassroots]] of Hong Kong society, struggling to survive and haunted by demons in their respective pasts.

The film takes place in the [[Sham Shui Po]] area of [[Kowloon]], Hong Kong circa 2000.  Lai Chung-Chung ([[Prudence Liew]]) is a [[crack cocaine]]-addicted yet good-natured [[street walker]] who is fast approaching a "destiny call" made by a fortune teller advising her that in the year 2000, she would finally repent all her sins from her previous life and will turn over a new leaf.  To prepare herself for the life-changing event, she works hard to save up for a dentistry process to clean her badly decaying teeth and gums from years of crack cocaine use.  After witnessing Lai heroically save a child from being hit by a van, freelance photographer Chi ([[Sammy Leung]]) thought that Lai would make a good human interest story for a magazine and starts to photograph Lai while having his girlfriend, journalist Elaine ([[Toby Leung]]) interview her.  During Elaine's interview with Lai, it is revealed that Lai has had a troubled past with her mother and younger sister.  The other subject is Wong Lin-Fa ([[Race Wong]]), a woman from [[Mainland China]] who married Kin: a middle-aged, construction-working Hong Konger, in hopes of attaining a better life by gaining [[Right of abode in Hong Kong|Hong Kong residency]]. Upon hearing Kin died in a work accident, Wong travels to Hong Kong, pregnant with Kin's child in hopes of collecting an abundance of [[condolences|condolence money]] from Kin's family.  However, she only receives HK$5000 and is kicked out by the family, who labels Wong as a [[wikt:gold digger|golddigger]]. She then moves into Kin's apartment in a building that many prostitutes inhabit, including Lai. Insurance broker Lau Fu-Yi ([[Anthony Wong Chau-Sang]]) notifies Wong that Kin had bought life insurance with her as the sole beneficiary. Lau later begins an unlikely friendship with Wong, helping her with her quest to give birth and gain residency in Hong Kong, all the while trying to sell her insurance. Lau has a way of classifying people in his head by calculating their potential insurance coverage.  He does this for Lai and Chi and quickly dismisses them as having a potential of $0 while evaluating Wong at US$2 million.<ref>[http://www.hermanyau.com/eTrueWomenForSale.htm Herman Yau official website] Retrieved on 11 February 2010</ref>

The trio are soon attacked by a [[plesiosaur]] that is suddenly eaten by a ''[[Tylosaurus]]'' which then proceeds to attack the trio. After the group arrive on shore, they are encountered by a group of Native Americans who ride on tamed terror birds.  Meanwhile, Chichak arrives to the presence a group of [[Caveman|cavemen]] and is attacked by them. After Chichak kills the cavemen king, he becomes the new king of the group, having asserted his authoritative dominance. Back at Turok's group, Sepinta ([[Cree Summer]]), the village chief, is informed by Aniwa (Mia Crowe) that they found strangers (Turok and the group). The group is escorted to the village by Koba who informs Sepinta that he saw Turok kill a "longneck" (plesiosaur). Sepinta reveals that she is the Chief of the Cliff People. Turok tells Sepinta their story of how they got to the Lost Lands, to which Sepinta does not believe.  To prove that they are not hostile, Sepinta gives them the task of gathering food for the tribe. The first task for Turok is to get an egg from a Pteranodon nest. While Koba shows him and Andar where the nest is, Turok insists he do it. Once he reaches the nest, gets the egg, and puts it in a sack, he is attacked by a family of ''Pteranodon'', who were trying to protect the egg. Turok managed to get on top of one and ride it. Though it tried to fight back, they both crashed and fell right next to the village. Turok then snaps the neck of the ''Pteranodon'', killing it; before he reveals the egg, which is safe and not broken. The villagers cheer for him, but the wound Turok received earlier from the plesiosaur is too much, and he collapses, unconscious.  Later that night, a caveman is seen outside roasting something on a rotisserie. Inside the cave, the cavemen are seen having dinner, which consists of meat from many animals and people that they killed. Two cavemen are banging rocks and sticks on logs for playing music, and three bow to Chichak, who is using a stone that resembles a chair as a throne. A cavewoman is seen feeding her children meat. Another cavewoman offers Chichak some meat, who assumes it's his horse (which was killed) so he refuses. The female begins to grunt to have him eat it, while three cavemen watch her. When Chichak finally takes it, he takes a strip of it and finds it to be not bad before continuing to eat.  Outside, the cooking caveman is seen taking two big chunks of meat of his dinner. The meat that he is eating reveals that it is the caveman king (who still has that bayonet impaled through his head). As Chichak finishes his meat, he orders all of the cavepeople to listen to him. He tells them that he is looking for others like him, but they do not seem to understand. He repeats it again by saying that they look like him and wants to kill them. However, they still do not understand and go back to eating. One caveman tells him to sit down, but Chichak does not want to stay with them, but to find his enemy. The caveman tries to calm him down, but Chichak shoots him in the head, shocking the others. Chichak then takes some blood from the dead caveman and makes two familiar marks on the wall, shocking the others with surprise. When he asked if they have seen the marks before, all of the cavemen agree and point outside to tell him where they are.  At the cliff village, Aniwa is seen marking Catori and Andar. While she does that Sepinta says, "With every sunrise, we fight for our lives. This is our way. We do not fear it. And every night, beneath the moon, we take shelter. Strong because we are many." She mentions to them that the mark they have on their faces is the mark of her people before telling them to rise. Andar whispers to his mother that the mark is same as their people. Sepinta will also have Turok marked once his wounds heal, and she thanks the Great Spirit for bringing them here. The celebration then begins. At the celebration, there is a female dancer, several villagers playing drums, etc. Aniwa is seen serving the cooked ''Pteranodon'' egg. A villager gets a scoop of egg from her before heading to Koba, who is cooking the ''Pteranodon'' on a rotisserie. He gives a slice of meat to him. When Andar arrives to have his order, he smiles at Aniwa, who smiles back before giving him more than one scoop of egg. Inside the cave, Turok wakes up with wraps around his torso. He takes a look outside to see the celebration before heading to the balcony outside. Then he meets a mysterious Lost Land shaman ([[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]]) with a mask made from a killed animal. The shaman asks him why he was standing here alone. Turok asks him why he is hiding behind a mask. The shaman responds to Turok that he only wanted to know is why is he alone in the dark. Turok said that that is "where he belongs." The shaman asks, "Did you say I am hiding?" Then, Aniwa and Andar are excited to see Turok awake and well. They want him to join the celebration. When they take him there, Turok sees that the shaman is gone. Andar insists that Turok eat some of what he caught, which makes Aniwa laugh.  The day after the celebration, Koba is teaching Andar how to hunt. They both find a ''Megaloceros'' and bring it down with two arrows. When the dead carcass is taken to the village, Aniwa tries to cut through the hide with a bladed rock, which looks pretty dull. It is not able to cut through the hide easily, to which Catori hands her a blade, which is able to successfully work in cutting the hide of the creature. Aniwa turns around to see Koba and Andar, who makes a victory smile. Koba gives Andar a pat and accidentally makes him fall in a silly way. Sepinta is seen carving a rock to make a spear with Turok watching. The villagers then tie the ''Megaloceros'''s hide onto wooden poles and make lined holes on them. Sepinta is also making what appears to be beads. Aniwa is then training Andar to ride on a terror bird, which goes out of control. Later that night, Sepinta brings Turok's weapons to him, who thanks her. Sepinta tells him that he is free to go unless he decides to stay, but Turok says he and his people do not belong in the underworld. Sepinta tells him that this is his home now, but Turok replies that he has no home. He tells her that they leave tomorrow, which upsets Sepinta. The chief sentry calls out, "Tower!" with the tower sentry saying, "Tower all clear!" The tower sentry then says, "Bridge!" with the bridge sentry saying, "Bridge all clear!" However, the tamed Terror Birds are bothered by something or someone that has startled them. When the bridge sentry asks them what's wrong, Chichak suddenly appears and snaps his neck. He takes the dead sentry's helmet to disguise himself and then proceeds to the bridge. The tower sentry yawns as Chichak blocks his mouth and stabs him with a spear, killing him. When he heads to the chief sentry, the chief sentry, who believes Chichak is one of their own, asks him why is he on this side. Chichak impales him with the spear, killing the sentry. Chichak puts his new helmet back on and tells the cavemen that the coast is clear to attack.  Turok is seen in his cave and hears a noise, believing that it is Sepinta. However, it is a caveman, and he attacks him. Turok throws his tomahawk at the caveman, but it did not kill him. When the caveman proceeds to strangle him, Turok sinks it deeper and tears it out, which is enough to kill the caveman. As he gathers his bow and arrows, several of the other villagers are attacked and killed by the cavemen. One caveman lifts up a villager and tears him apart off screen. A little girl is attacked by a caveman, but Turok distracts it with three arrows, though this did not kill it. When it sees him, Turok shoots another arrow and this time hits it in the chest, but it did not go deep enough, which allows the caveman to remove it.  When Turok asks Sepinta what it takes to kill these "men," Sepinta responds that they are not men. She knocks down the caveman and it gets impaled by the three arrows, but it still does not die. The caveman then tries to pull Sepinta towards it to impale her with the arrows, but Turok successfully saves her by finishing off the caveman with an arrow in its head. Catori and Andar are attacked by a caveman, which gets shot by Andar with an arrow, but it does not die. It tries to remove the arrow, but only gets half of it. When Catori asks what they are, Andar says that they are devils. The caveman is about to attack them, but it gets bashed in the head by Turok's tomahawk. Turok tells them stay in the opening when they fight them and warns them that if they get cornered by them, they will die. As he goes out to fight the cavemen, at least two villagers are impaled by a spear thrown by the cavemen.  Four female villagers attempted to get to safety by climbing up a ladder, but a caveman shakes the ladder and throws both it and the four villagers off the nearby cliff. While Turok aids Koba, Chichak prepares to shoot him, only for Koba and a villager to chase him away. Chichak kills the villager as Koba catches up to him. Chichak stabs Koba's right leg, which gives the cavemen the chance to kill him. Koba uses a spear and tosses some of the cavemen into the void. When Sepinta sees Chichak, she wonders who he is, to which Turok replies that he's his enemy. As Koba bravely tries to fend all of them off and prevent them from reaching the other side, the fight causes a hole in the bridge, and a caveman latches onto Koba in an attempt to not fall. Koba shakes him off, and the caveman falls to his death. As Koba gets back up, some of the cavemen have already reached the other side but are killed by Sepinta and Turok.  He then tells her to cut the bridge or the cavemen will keep coming until the Cliff People are all dead, but Sepinta rushes to help Koba. When she tries to help him, Turok tells her to do it, but Sepinta will not allow Koba to die. With no choice, Turok pushes her out of the way and prepares to cut the ropes. Koba nods at Turok to do it and accepts his fate. Turok cuts the ropes, which sends Koba and the caught Cavemen into the void, killing them. Sepinta looks down with sadness and sorrow at Koba's loss. Without the bridge, Chichak and the other Cavemen cannot reach the other side, but he tells Turok to look behind him. A lot of villagers have been killed, with Chichak vowing to kill Turok and the others and reclaim his father's blame.  The next day, the surviving villagers are placing the wrapped bodies of the dead villagers together. The survivors are not happy at Turok, who notices the Lost Land shaman. The villagers argue that Turok must avenge their dead, that the cave dwellers have come for Turok and darkness has fallen into their home, and blame Turok that he killed Koba. Sepinta persuades them and demonstrates the mark on a shield and mentions that with every sunrise, they fight for their lives, and this is their way, they do not fear it. She tells them that Koba could not hold them back and because of Turok, he died a hero. Later, the Cliff People gather their things and their mounts (which do not just include the terror birds but also [[mastodon]]s, ''[[Uintatherium]]'', and ''Arsinoitherium''). Turok tells Sepinta that it is time for them to return to their own world.  Catori tells him that she and Andar will go with Sepinta instead. When Turok tries to give the charm (which Catori had when she was young) to Catori, she lets him keep it, as it is something of hers that will keep him safe. Sepinta then tells Turok to follow the setting sun past the mountain with two peaks if he changes his mind. It begins to rain as Turok leaves, and the villagers head forward. On his way, Turok discovers tracks of the cave dwellers. He then climbs on the edge where the waterfall is. He finds claw or teeth marks on a tree trunk. He hears noises and discovers the ''Carnotaurus'' (which is discovered to be a female), seen feeding her two young. The dinosaur has caught a [[wild boar]]. She drops the injured pig as her two offspring begin to feast on it. The ''Carnotaurus'' leaves to find food for herself.  Turok proceeds to follow and ends up finding the lair of the cavemen. Suddenly, one of them appears out of nowhere and knocks him out. Turok then wakes up with his arms tied to a pillar. He is surround by several cave dwellers and Chichak arrives with the tomahawk that used to belong his father. He chats with Turok about it and having Turok's chief killed. Turok yells at him that his chief was his brother. Chichak then asks him why was he not fighting by his brother's side. He then sinks his hand into one of Turok's wounds and goes deeper. He uses Turok's blood to make the mark on his face. When he asks him about the location of Catori, Andar, and the villagers, Turok refuses to answer. Chichak then begins to slash him with a knife.  Later, a blackened scene shows drops of water falling. The next one shows Turok awaken to see Chichak and the cave dwellers, with Chichak asking "Why were you not fighting by his side?" with a dark voice heard at the end. The next scene shows Koba nodding at Turok that he accepts his fate, with Sepinta shouting his name as Koba falls to his doom. We then see Koba falling and vanish with a small dripping sound wave. Chichak's voice then says "Ready to join your brother, Turok?" The next scene shows Turok offering to give Catori's charm back, but she lets him keep it. The next one shows several cavemen growling. Then a flashback from the beginning of the movie with young Catori saying, "You'll never catch me, Turok!" The next flashback shows a wounded Nashoba, who Turok mistakenly attacks with Catori saying, "Turok, you're killing him!" The next scene shows Turok in his land, and he is following the Lost Land shaman. The shaman stops and tells Turok that he wants him to see something. He reveals an image of the ''Carnotaurus'' roaring and shows it about to feed Turok to her young. The shaman says that the "great horned one" is the most feared creature in the Lost Land, but it only kills because that is what it was made for. The shaman then removes the mask to reveal himself as Nashoba and asks Turok what he was made for.  Turok wakes up with drops of water falling on his head and the sun rising. Chichak arrives with two cavemen and reveals that they have captured Andar, who secretly followed Turok. Chichak threatens to kill Andar if Turok refuses to tell him where the Cliff People are. Turok finally answers by telling him that they went to the summer hunting grounds. The trail goes west from the cliffs. He tells him to look for the mountain with two peaks. Chichak spares Andar and tells the cavemen to watch over them. Andar becomes sad and blames himself, but Turok tells him his father's strength is in both Andar and Turok himself. While one cave dweller picks lice off of the other's head, Turok tells Andar to do what he needs to do when he gives the signal. When Turok frees himself, he tells Andar to perform the distraction. When Andar acts like he is a child, the cavemen hear him and wander off to investigate. Turok knocks one of the cavemen out. The other one sees him and tries to attack him, but Turok impales it with a spear. The other caveman recovers and tries to attack him. Andar wraps his arms around the caveman's neck, but he gets tossed off. Turok then throws the spear and it strikes the caveman right on the left shoulder, killing it. As the two get out, blood begins to come out of Turok's cuts, which Turok lets drop onto the floor. When Andar asks what he is doing, Turok says, "From blood follows blood." As they walk, he leaves a trail behind. The smell of blood attracts the ''Carnotaurus''. The dinosaur finds them as Turok pushes Andar out of the way to prevent him from being eaten. Turok uses a spear tied with a rope from the tip and end. He uses it on the ''Carnotaurus'''s mouth like the reins of a horse. He is able to tame it and get it to head to the mountain with two peaks, and Andar gets on.  Meanwhile, while the villagers were on their way to the summer hunting grounds, one of the mastodons stepped on a sharp rock. Sepinta tells the others to put what she carries onto the others. Catori tells Sepinta that one of the women said that she sent no one to find Andar. Sepinta says that Andar may come back himself, but the truth is she cannot spare anyone. Catori asks if she must go alone, to which Sepita says that she would die. Catori begs for her to help her find her child, but Sepinta tells her that he is not a child and if he went after Turok, she cannot make others pay for his mistake, much to Catori's dismay. Suddenly, falling rocks are thrown by the cave dwellers. They managed to trap the Cliff People, and they begin to attack. Chichak is successfully able to kill many of them. One of the mastodons has been killed. Aniwa and her terror bird both fight off several cavemen, but her mount is presumably killed (later the people will take her terror bird to the Lost Land animal hospital). Sepinta and Catori both shoot arrows at the Cavemen. One Caveman is about to kill Catori, but Chichak shoots him and he threatens to kill her himself.  Suddenly, Chichak sees the tamed ''Carnotaurus'' with Turok and Andar. The ''Carnotaurus'' steps on several of the Cave Dwellers as Chichak tries to shoot it but misses. Several of the other Cave Dwellers are knocked off of the cliff. Andar jumps off of the dinosaur to go find Aniwa. She gives him a hug, and Aniwa tells him that the others said he was dead, but she knew he would come. Andar says that the man defends the people he loves. Suddenly, a Caveman attacks them, but the two kill it with their knives. Andar shoots his arrows, while Aniwa uses her knife to fight off the Cavemen. The Cave Dwellers even try to fight the dinosaur. The ''Carnotaurus'' devours one of them, and Turok jumps off of the dinosaur. Turok slashes several of the Cavemen with the tamed dinosaur aiding him. Catori states her shock at the creature, and suddenly, Sepinta is shot in the head by Chichak. Enraged, Turok charges at him and they wrestle each other. Chichak is able to punch him a few times, but Turok manages to get his father's tomahawk and tosses it in the air before grabbing the handle again. Chichak picks up his gun, laughs, and says, "Die, Turok!" He then fires his gun, but the bullet misses. Turok throws the tomahawk and it goes right through Chichak's neck. Chichak tries to cover his neck to stop the bleeding but fails. Chichak is dead, and his severed head falls to the ground.  The tamed ''Carnotaurus'' then stomps Chichak's head flat. The dinosaur roars at the villagers, then approaches Turok and snarls at him, as lightning flashes in the background. Turok remains still as the ''Carnotaurus'' reveals blood on her teeth. She makes a few growls as if she is trying to communicate with him to either thank him or tell him that she must do something else. The remaining cavemen try to sneak past her, but she catches them. The cave dwellers run for their lives as the ''Carnotaurus'' chases them. With Turok letting the ''Carnotaurus'' live to chase after the cavemen, he turns back to see everyone with Sepinta, who is dead. On top of the summer hunting grounds, everyone is seen with torches and plan to burn Sepinta's body, weapons, and items. They all look down with sadness and sorrow for the loss of their chief. Aniwa sobs as she and Andar let go.  Aniwa is the first to place her torch on the ground, and she says, "With every sunrise, we fight for our lives." Andar places his torch and says, "This is our way, we do not fear it." Catori places hers and says, "And every night, beneath the moon, we take shelter." Turok is the last and says, "Strong... because we are many." He places his torch as the fire surrounds Sepinta. Turok looks behind him to see everyone.

After a week of absence from school, Edward returns to school, and begins socializing with Bella normally. A few days later, Bella is nearly struck by a van in the school parking lot. Edward saves her by instantaneously covering a distance of over thirty feet, and putting himself between Bella and the van, stopping it with only his hand, and making a conspicuous dent on the van. He subsequently refuses to explain his actions to Bella, and warns her against befriending him.

When they arrive, Leonard finds that he had been set up with the other family's daughter, Sandra (Shaw). She inquires about his interest in [[photography]] and notices a photo of a girl above his headboard. He explains he had been engaged to the girl for several years, but the relationship was broken off when it turned out both he and his fiancée carried the gene for [[Tay–Sachs]] disease, which results in diseased children who generally don't live beyond age 12, so they would be unable to have healthy children.  Leonard meets a new neighbor, Michelle (Paltrow), and is immediately attracted to her, choosing to ignore that she has a [[drug]] usage problem. He learns that she is dating a married partner in her [[law firm]], Ronald (Koteas). At her request, Leonard agrees to meet Ronald and Michelle for dinner at a restaurant. The couple leave him later that evening, as they have plans to attend the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. Leonard returns home upset, but to his surprise, Sandra arrives, sent over by Leonard's parents. She is under the impression that Leonard wanted her to come by, but realizes by his surprised look that she was set up. She apologizes for the misunderstanding and says that, if he isn't interested, a lot of other guys are. Leonard says that he likes her, and they kiss and eventually [[Sexual intercourse|make love]], and with time, his relationship with Sandra deepens.  Michelle calls Leonard and says she is sick. He takes her to the hospital, where she has a [[Dilation and curettage|D&C]] for a [[miscarriage]].  She had not known she was [[pregnant]] and is even more upset that Ronald didn't respond to her calls. Leonard takes her home but Ronald arrives. Leonard hides while Ronald apologizes to Michelle for not having come to her aid. Michelle coldly asks Ronald to leave. She then asks Leonard to write something on her forearm with his finger while she falls asleep. Leonard writes "I love you".  Two weeks later, Michelle meets Leonard on the roof of their building and tells him that she has broken up with Ronald and is going to [[San Francisco]]. Leonard tells her not to leave and professes his love for her. They have sex and plan to leave together the next day for San Francisco.

He is then summoned by Sandra's father and is offered a partnership in the family businesses, with the assumption that he is going to marry Sandra. Noticing the jeweler's gift bag Leonard is holding, the father assumes it is for Sandra; Leonard lies that it is.  During his parents' New Year's Eve party, Leonard ducks out to the [[courtyard]] to meet Michelle. Michelle arrives ten minutes past departure time and tells Leonard that she isn't going to San Francisco, because Ronald, having learned Michelle is leaving him for California, decided to leave his wife and children for her. Distraught, Leonard breaks things off with her for good.  Feeling desolate, Leonard heads to the [[beach]], presumably intending to kill himself. When he drops a glove that Sandra had bought for him, he realizes that, in Sandra, he has found someone who loves him and with whom he can build a decent life. He picks up the glove and sees the boxed engagement ring lying on the sand, where he had thrown it from the boardwalk earlier. He returns to the party, where he gives Sandra the ring and embraces her in a prolonged hug.

Untraceable
 Special Agent Jennifer Marsh ([[Diane Lane]]) is a [[widow]]ed [[single parent]] living in a [[suburb]]an [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] home with her daughter, Annie Haskins ([[Perla Haney-Jardine]]), and her mother, Stella Marsh ([[Mary Beth Hurt]]). At night, she works in the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s [[cybercrime]] division with Griffin Dowd ([[Colin Hanks]]), fighting [[identity theft]] and similar crimes. One night, an anonymous tip leads them to a website called KillWithMe.com. The site features a streaming video of a [[cat]] being tortured and killed. The website cannot be shut down, as the creator knew that someone would try and built into it a fail-safe; every time the server is closed, a [[mirror website|mirror server]] immediately replaces it.  After the cat's death, KillWithMe.com's webmaster graduates to human victims, kidnapping them and placing them in death traps that are progressively activated by the number of hits the website receives. The first victim is a helicopter pilot (bled to death by injections of [[anticoagulant]]), followed by a newscaster (burnt to death by heat lamps while cemented into the floor). At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid the website, but as Jennifer feared this only [[Streisand effect|increases the site's popularity]].  Griffin is kidnapped after investigating a lead based on his hunch as to the killer's identity. In the killer's basement, he is submerged up to his neck in a vat of water with his mouth taped shut; the death trap introduces into the water a concentration of [[sulfuric acid]]. After the killer leaves the room, Griffin uses his dying moments to blink a message in [[morse code]], giving the FBI the lead he was following up on.  Jennifer follows up on the morse code message to discover that the victims were not random: they were involved in broadcasting or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher. The teacher's unstable techno prodigy son, Owen Reilly ([[Joseph Cross (actor)|Joseph Cross]]), broke down and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. When released, he decided to take revenge and prove a point: that the public's interest in the suffering of others is insatiable, as well as to wreak vengeance on those he felt had exploited his father's death.   The police raid Owen's house but he is not present. Owen has been following Jennifer because he is now obsessed with her. He captures and places Jennifer in a makeshift death trap: hanging her above a [[cultivator]] and progressively lowering her to her death. Jennifer escapes by swinging out of the way while dangling from the ceiling. She breaks free and pins down the murderer, fatally shooting Owen on his own website as the police arrive. Jennifer displays her FBI badge to the webcam.  The chatter in the website's [[chat room]] dwindles, statements being made such as "a genius died today" as well as "glad the killer is dead" and another one saying "You go girl!", and a final comment asking whether the video could be downloaded.

The following day, Abhi drops Gautam at the marriage venue but declines to attend the marriage. Gautam asks for the heart-shaped watch as a remembrance, but Abhi refuses to give it and leaves. As he is leaving, Nandini asks Abhi if he told their story to her father, to which Abhi replies that he doubted her love. Hurt, Nandini tells him not to show his face again. With tears in her eyes, she gets married to Gautam.  Abhi leaves, taking her memories and Devadas with him. On the way, Abhi goes to the waterfall where Nandini proposed to him. There Devadas dies.

Vacancy 2: The First Cut
 Set three years before the first film, the action takes place in and around the Meadow View Inn, a small roadside motel in rural [[North Carolina]]. It opens with newlyweds driving and the bride wants to have sex in the car, which makes the groom stop. They are then stopped by a man, whose property they are on, so they head to the motel. The manager, Gordon ([[David Moscow]]), oversees an operation of using cameras within the motel to videotape the newlyweds having sex.  Later, a serial killer, Smith (Scott G. Anderson), checks into the motel and brutally murders a woman he brought with him in one of the motel rooms. The horrified staff see the whole crime on videotape and then subdue the man. They do not know what to do with him, however, as they will endanger their operation if they call the police. Smith manages to convince Gordon and his staff to hire him to torture and murder the motel guests on videotape and then sell them as [[snuff film]]s.   The trucker confirms that this is indeed a functional market and Gordon agrees under the conditions that he is the leader of the operation. Smith mockingly agrees. A couple of days later, a young couple, Jessica ([[Agnes Bruckner]]) and Caleb ([[Trevor Wright]]), and their friend Tanner ([[Arjay Smith]]) check into the Meadow View Inn for a night's rest, unaware of the inn's sick-minded employees and their nefarious intentions.  As the killers begin to terrorize the hotel guests, it quickly becomes apparent that Smith is a loose-cannon, with no intention of following Gordon's lead. He fashions a crude mask out of wire and proceeds to murder two of the hotel's three guests. They capture and stab Caleb in the stomach until he dies, while Jessica and Tanner hide in the woods and then run to a nearby house. It is revealed that the man who stopped the newlyweds, Otis, lives in the house with his wife. They let Jessica and Tanner in. They tell the couple about the killers, but Otis does not believe them. Smith and the others come in, telling the man that Jessica and Tanner stole from them, which Otis believes. But his wife does not, as she takes the phone and is about to call the police. Smith then shoots Otis and his wife, and runs after Jessica and Tanner.  They catch both and torture Tanner first. Smith calls the others off, since he wants to kill Jessica himself. The others are watching on tape what Smith is going to do. One of them does not want to kill anymore and Gordon says to let it play out, then they will call the cops and blame the whole thing on Smith. Smith leaves the room to check on Gordon and the others. Jessica finds a way to untie herself in the meantime. Smith comes back and is about to kill Jessica, and she manages to stab him in the jaw, but Smith survives. Jessica escapes, and Gordon and the others run to see what happened to Smith. Jessica hides and finds dead bodies. She then finds Caleb dead and Tanner, dying, while choking on his blood. Meanwhile, Smith and the others desperately search for Jessica. One of the staff go to the place where Jessica hid, but she hides under Caleb's body and pushes it upward, killing the employee (since it had low ceiling with nails sticking out of it). Jessica takes his gun and runs to the truck, rummages through the glove box, then she goes underwater in the lake. Gordon goes to the lake and searches for her.  He finds a sweater sticking out of the water, thinking it is her. Jessica pulls the gun out of the water. Gordon turns around to see it as Jessica pulls the trigger, killing him. Smith hears the gunshot and runs to the lake. Jessica gets out quickly and hides in Smith's trailer. He finds her and tries to stab her, but she burns him and runs. The next day, the cops arrive and Jessica tells the story. They are skeptical of her story because the cameras and bodies have disappeared. At another hotel ( the Pinewood Hotel, the motel in the very first movie) a badly scarred Smith informs the trucker that he will have the motel up and running in a few weeks, just as soon as the cameras are set. Smith gives the trucker the very first snuff film that features one of the guests he murdered at the Meadow View Inn. He tells the trucker that he will make more copies as soon as he can.

Stauffenberg is stunned to learn that no plans exist on the subject of what is to be done after Hitler's assassination.  During a bombing raid on Berlin, he gets the idea of using [[Operation Valkyrie]], which involves the deployment of the Reserve Army to maintain order in the event of a national emergency. The plotters carefully redraft the plan's orders so that they can dismantle the Nazi ''régime'' after assassinating Hitler. Realizing that only General [[Friedrich Fromm]], the head of the [[Replacement Army|Reserve Army]], can initiate Valkyrie, they offer him a position as head of the Wehrmacht in a post-Nazi Germany and request his support, but Fromm declines to be directly involved, stating he will not side with them so long as Hitler is alive. With the rewritten Operation Valkyrie orders needing to be signed by Hitler, Stauffenberg visits the Führer at his [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]] estate in [[Bavaria]]. Fromm's influence allows Stauffenberg to bring the copy directly before Hitler, and in the presence of [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Heinrich Himmler]], [[Hermann Göring]], [[Wilhelm Keitel]] and [[Albert Speer]], his inner circle, Hitler praises Stauffenberg's heroism in [[North Africa]] and signs the orders without fully examining the modifications, believing Stauffenberg's changes "are for the best".  At Goerdeler's insistence, Stauffenberg is ordered to assassinate both Hitler and SS head Himmler at the Führer's command bunker, the [[Wolfsschanze|Wolf's Lair]]. At a final briefing, Colonel [[Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim|Mertz von Quirnheim]] instructs the committee members in the use of [[pencil detonator]]s. Stauffenberg also persuades General [[Erich Fellgiebel|Fellgiebel]], who controls all communications at Wolf's Lair, to cut off communications after the bomb blast. On July&nbsp;15, 1944, Stauffenberg attends a strategy meeting at Wolf's Lair with the bomb in his briefcase, but with Himmler not present at the meeting, Stauffenberg does not get the go-ahead from the committee leaders, and by the time von Quirnheim defies the others and tells him to do it anyway, the meeting is over. Meanwhile, the Reserve Army is mobilized by Olbricht, unbeknownst to Fromm, to stand by. With no action taken, Stauffenberg safely extracts himself and the bomb from the bunker, and the Reserve Army is ordered to stand down, believing that the mobilization was a drill. Back in Berlin, Olbricht and Stauffenberg are threatened by Fromm that if they try to control the reserve army again he will personally have them arrested; Stauffenberg goes to the committee to protest their indecisiveness and condemns Goerdeler, who has been selected to be chancellor after the [[coup]]. When Goerdeler demands that Stauffenberg be relieved, Beck informs him that the SS has issued a warrant for his arrest, and that he must leave the country immediately.  On July 20, 1944, Stauffenberg and his adjutant Lieutenant [[Werner von Haeften|Haeften]] return to Wolf's Lair. To Stauffenberg's dismay, he discovers only after the timer has been activated that, due to the warm weather, the conference is being held in an open-window summer barrack, whereas the plotters had intended to detonate the bomb within the walls of the bunker for maximum damage. While his adjutant waits with the car, Stauffenberg places the briefcase with the bomb armed at the meeting as close to Hitler as possible. Stauffenberg then leaves the barrack, returning to the car. However, one of the officers at the meeting moves the bomb behind a table leg, which will inadvertently protect Hitler from most of the blast. When the bomb explodes, Stauffenberg is certain that Hitler is dead and flees Wolf's Lair. Before shutting down communications, Fellgiebel calls Mertz about the explosion but cannot clearly convey whether or not Hitler is dead. Just before severing communications, Fellgiebel sees from his window that Hitler has survived the explosion.  As Stauffenberg flies back to Berlin, Olbricht refuses to mobilize the Reserve Army until he knows without a doubt that Hitler is dead (if Hitler isn't dead, Olbricht will be arrested for having the reserve army mobilized without Fromm's permission). Behind Olbricht's back, Mertz forges his signature and issues the orders anyway. With Operation Valkyrie underway, Stauffenberg and his fellow plotters order the arrest of Nazi party leaders and SS officers, convincing lower officers that the Party and the SS are staging a coup. As Army soldiers begin to take control of Berlin's government ministries, including [[Niederkirchnerstraße|SS headquarters]], mid-level officers relaying the orders begin to wonder which side they should be fighting for. Rumors reach Berlin that Hitler survived the blast, but Stauffenberg dismisses them as SS propaganda. Meanwhile, Fromm learns from Field Marshal Keitel that Hitler is still alive. The General refuses to join the plotters, resulting in them detaining him. Major [[Otto Ernst Remer]] of the Reserve Army prepares to arrest Goebbels, but is stopped when Goebbels connects him by phone to Hitler.  Immediately recognizing the voice on the other end, Remer realizes that the Reserve Army has been duped—rather than containing a coup, they have unwittingly supported it. SS officers are released and the plotters in turn are besieged inside the [[Bendlerblock]]. The headquarters staff flees, but the resistance leaders are arrested. In an ultimately vain effort to save himself, General Fromm convenes an impromptu court martial, places Beck under arrest, and sentences Von Quirnheim, Olbricht, Haeften, and Stauffenberg to death, contravening Hitler's orders that they be kept alive. Given a pistol by Fromm, Beck commits suicide. That night, the ringleaders are then executed by [[firing squad]] one by one. Some distance away, General Von Tresckow commits suicide with a grenade. When Stauffenberg is about to be shot, in a last gesture of loyalty and defiance, Haeften places himself in the path of the bullets meant for Stauffenberg. When his turn arrives, Colonel Stauffenberg's last act is to cry "Long live sacred Germany!"

Vantage Point (film)
  U.S. President Henry Ashton (Hurt) attends a political summit in [[Salamanca]], [[Spain]], to promote an international treaty. Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new ''vantage point'' is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.<ref name=film/>  From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.<ref name=film/>  The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.<ref name=film/>  In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass. When he confronts her, Veronica assures Enrique of her love for him as he hands her a bag. When the president is shot, Enrique rushes onto the stage to protect the mayor, but is tackled by Barnes. While being detained, he witnesses Veronica toss the bag he gave her under the podium, causing the second explosion. Enrique escapes as the agents who previously had him in custody mount a chase while firing shots in his direction, failing to subdue him. Enrique confronts an unseen individual at the overpass and asks if he is surprised to see him still alive.<ref name=film/>  The fourth vantage point revolves around Howard Lewis who is chatting with a man called Sam (Taghmaoui), while a little girl named Anna (Zapien), bumps into him and drops her ice cream. Later, Lewis notices Barnes looking at the curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building, and captures the footage with his camcorder. Following the second explosion at the podium, Lewis chases Enrique and the pursuing Secret Service agents. At the overpass, Lewis views the pair of agents from afar shooting in the direction of Enrique as he greets an individual in a police uniform under the overpass. Seriously wounded, Enrique falls to the ground. Lewis sees Anna who had earlier become separated from her mother, trying to cross a busy intersection. An ambulance races down the road about to hit Anna, as Lewis runs out to save her.<ref name=film/>  The fifth vantage point begins as President Ashton, having been informed of a credible assassination threat, has returned to his hotel room with his aides while his body double proceeds to the gathering in the plaza. The President talks with his personnel about the reason for the terrorists' plot, the retaliation by the U.S. to the plot, the return of Barnes to active duty, and giving the order for the retaliation to proceed. The first explosion occurs just outside the hotel. Seconds later, a masked assailant bursts into the president's room, shoots his advisers and then proceeds to abduct Ashton.<ref name=film/>  By the sixth vantage point, terrorist Suarez, previously seen as Sam, shoots Ashton's body double using a remote-controlled automatic rifle placed in an adjacent window next to the one with the fluttering curtain that had drawn Barnes' attention earlier. The rifle is retrieved by Taylor, who Barnes sees leaving the scene wearing a Spanish policeman's uniform on one of the GNN live feeds, even though he tells Barnes that he's in pursuit of the assassin over the phone. Barnes realizes Taylor is actually part of the terror plot. The man Enrique saw embracing Veronica is revealed to be sharpshooter Javier (Ramirez), whose brother is being held hostage to ensure Javier's cooperation with the terrorists. The first explosion, at the hotel, is revealed to be a device detonated by a suicide bomber disguised as a bellhop who had previously handed Javier a hotel room key. Javier kills the guards and aides within the hotel, and kidnaps the president. Ashton is later placed in an ambulance with Suarez and Veronica disguised as medics. Javier joins Taylor in a police car to a planned rendezvous at the overpass. Barnes commandeers a car and chases Taylor and Javier. Barnes gets into a collision with a truck, allowing the duo to escape. At the overpass, Enrique, who did not die in the blast at the podium as intended, confronts Javier and Taylor. Enraged, Javier shoots Enrique, mistakenly believing he had knowledge of his kidnapped brother's whereabouts. Javier is then shot and killed by Taylor when he demands to be brought to his brother, who had been killed earlier by Suarez. Enrique dies of his wounds as Barnes reaches the scene on foot firing several rounds at Taylor, who attempts to flee. After crashing his car, a critically injured Taylor is dragged out by Barnes. He orders Taylor to reveal where the president has been taken, but Taylor dies. Meanwhile, Ashton regains consciousness in the ambulance and attacks Veronica, distracting her and Suarez just as Anna runs into their path. Suarez swerves causing the ambulance to flip over just as Lewis pulls Anna out of its way. Barnes runs to the ambulance where he sees Veronica lying dead. He shoots Suarez dead and rescues the president.<ref name=film />

Virus Undead
 Professor Bergen, a famous medical researcher, discovers a vaccine to an [[H5N1]]-like viral pandemic.  However, his research indicates that the virus has mutated and caused increased aggression in the local birds.  While researching this phenomenon, he is attacked and killed by his test subjects, a flock of violent birds.  After missing the funeral, Robert, a medical student, returns to his childhood home to settle his grandfather's affairs.  He takes two friends along with him, fellow medical students  Eugen and Patrick, who have an antagonistic relationship.  When they arrive, Robert's ex-girlfriend, Marlene, confronts him and demands to know why he dumped her and left town.  As Robert and Marlene talk, Eugen and Patrick flirt with Marlene's friend, Vanessa.  Patrick invites the women to a party later that night despite Robert's protestations.  Later, the trio are harassed in turn by Bollman, the town bully, and Lieutenant Lehmann, an unfriendly cop.  When they finally arrive at Professor Bergen's mansion, they discover the place is in near ruins.  Robert gives his friends free rein, and they raid the wine cellar.  When the women arrive at the mansion, Robert and Marlene reconcile.  Vanessa and Patrick continue their flirting, and leave the others to have sex.  Eugen, drunk on [[absinthe]] and depressed, attempts to commit suicide, but Robert stops him.  Bollman, who has been using roadkill in his local fast food delivery service, becomes infected with the mutated virus.  Bollman develops large boils, becomes increasingly savage and animalistic, and goes on a violent rampage at Professor Bergen's mansion that culminates in his biting Patrick.  Patrick immediately falls ill, and Eugen taunts him with grim medical diagnoses, such as amputation.  Bollman, thought dead after the struggle, suddenly reappears and resumes his attacks.  Robert is forced to shoot him dead with a pistol.  Shaken, Robert volunteers to seek help, and Marlene joins him.  Eugen and Vanessa burn Bollman's body and watch over Patrick, though Eugen secretly continues his taunts and threatens to kill Patrick.  When Robert and Marlene see Lieutenant Lehmann murder and attempt to cannibalize a local, they retreat back to the mansion.  Robert and Marlene, who is a biology student, use Professor Bergen's lab to analyze the virus.  Robert urges Eugen to help, but Eugen dismisses their research as pointless and outright advocates killing Patrick.  When the semiconscious Patrick saves them from a stray villager who has entered the mansion, the others refuse to kill him; instead, they bind him upstairs and continue their research.  Eugen angrily leaves when Robert suggests that he, too, is infected, and Vanessa flees into the nearby woods.  As Eugen is in the process of turning, he helps Vanessa defeat several infected villagers, but he turns hostile.  In a moment of clarity, he commits suicide.  Robert and Marlene flee to the top of the mansion, where they realize there's no escape but to jump.  Robert survives the fall, but Marlene does not.  As dawn breaks, soldiers storm the property, kill the infected townspeople, and take Robert in for testing.  Convinced that Robert is uninfected, a rival scientist to Professor Bergen confidently asserts that they will have the situation under control soon, but Robert disputes that the virus can be stopped.

War, Inc.
 The film opens in a bar in [[Nunavut]] when hitman Brand Hauser ([[John Cusack]]) shoots and kills three men at the bar. He takes pictures of the men with his phone, sends the pictures, and then throws the phone into a burning garbage can.  Hauser is then seen on a plane getting directions and life advice from the on-board navigation system, Jerry ([[Montel Williams]]). He turns on his screen to receive a video call from the former Vice President ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) who gives him his next mission: to terminate Omar Sharif ([[Lyubomir Neikov]]), the CEO of the oil company Ugigas in Ugigistan. He tells Hauser that he will be working under the Viceroy, whose identity is still being withheld until further notice. He also tells Hauser that his cover will be a [[trade show]] host, working with Tamerlane, a huge corporation that specializes in advertising. He must produce a trade show and a gala wedding as a finale, and still manage to kill Omar Sharif before he makes his plane back to Ugigistan.  He is taken by a car to the safe [[Green Zone|Emerald City]] within the fictional war-torn desert country of Turaqistan. In the Tamerlane building, he meets Marsha ([[Joan Cusack]]), his assistant for the mission. Once inside the building, he notices a reporter, Natalie Hegalhuzen ([[Marisa Tomei]]) attempting unsuccessfully to get inside the Tamerlane building. Natalie attempts to find out why she can't get into Tamerlane, and after asking him several questions, is rushed out of the room by Hauser who doesn't want to reveal any personal details about himself. He does arrange for her to have drinks with him which she accepts. Hauser visits the Viceroy in a secret location hidden in a [[Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits|Popeye's]] restaurant, who tells him what he needs to do. The Viceroy (who cannot be seen, but only heard with an altered voice) informs Hauser that the grand finale of the Trade Show he's supposed to prepare will be a wedding for Yonica Babyyeah ([[Hilary Duff]]), an oversexed, [[Central Asia]]n [[Celebrity|pop star]]. He meets briefly with her and her fiancé, Ooq-Mi-Fay ([[Sergej Trifunović]]).  Later, Natalie meets Hauser at a restaurant where he gives her an all-access pass to the Trade Show. She arrives at the rehearsal and is greeted by Hauser and Marsha, who quickly go to watch Yonica's rehearsal. Her oversexed appearance and slight attraction for Hauser make him throw up on Natalie's coat and he walks out. After talking to Jerry in his car, he drinks some hot sauce and then has a flashback. He sees himself telling his fellow hitman Walken ([[Ben Kingsley]]) that he is tired of killing and wants to quit. He and Walken engage in a brief struggle in which he shoots Walken and leaves him for dead in the back of a garbage truck.  After receiving a delivery from a dry-cleaner in Germany, he goes to the hotel that Natalie stays in and gives her her coat, cleaned. He asks her out for coffee and confesses to her his habit of drinking hot sauce when he's nervous. She then confesses that she doesn't despise him at all, and the two build up a small friendship. He is later visited by Yonica in his office. She tries to seduce him, but he rebuffs her. He later sees her when he is in a restaurant with Sharif and Natalie. Hauser takes Natalie home, where she kisses him. Embarrassed, she quickly rushes out of the car. She sees him the next day and asks for a pass out of the Emerald City. He gives her a card that he received earlier by videomakers who are ''big in the Arts Community'', and might give her a good lead. Hours later, he visits Yonica and listens to her sing a beautiful ballad; from here on out, he develops a paternal affection for her.  Meanwhile, Natalie buys the cover for a pornographic video that the videomakers were going to shoot on Yonica's wedding night, and leaks it to the American press. After a confrontation with Ooq-Mi-Fay (who was involved in the making of this video), Hauser decides that the only way to continue with the wedding peacefully is to blame everything on Ooq-Mi-Fay's friend Bhodi Bhundhang. Bhodi hunts him down and tries to kill him in a big house that Yonica is supposed to do an interview in. There, Hauser reveals his past to Natalie and Yonica, and how his wife was killed and his daughter was kidnapped. He is interrupted when he hears a gun and rushes to another room, where he is forced to fight Bhodi. He kills Bhodi in front of Natalie and Yonica, who flee the house, horrified. They rush off into a cab, where Yonica asks Natalie to be her bridesmaid; Natalie accepts. Six hours before the wedding, Hauser receives a ransom video from what appears to be a gang of [[terrorist]]s, who have taken Natalie hostage. Hauser travels to a nearby city named Fallaf, saves Natalie, and makes it to Room 1101, where he had planned to meet and kill Sharif. Hauser has a change of heart and lets Sharif live, and in return is informed "the ultimate chicken-hawk is nearby". Realizing what this means Hauser goes to the Viceroy's secret location, and breaks down the glass to reveal the man behind the screen. The Viceroy is actually Walken &mdash; the man who killed Hauser's wife and kidnapped his daughter.  Hauser asks Walken what he did with his daughter, and finds out that Yonica was actually his daughter all along. He rushes to tell Yonica at the wedding, and arrives there right before Walken destroys the building, accidentally killing himself in the process. Fortunately, Hauser, Natalie, and Yonica survive, and rush off to a plane that Yonica and Ooq-Mi-Fay were supposed to fly off in. Once they are airborne, and have presumably escaped, we see a trailing missile about to strike the aircraft. The Vice President reveals his next plan to attack neighboring Ugigistan, blaming them for the bombing of the Emerald city, and terrorist incidents in Turaqistan.  
WALL-E
  In 2805, [[Earth]] is abandoned and covered in garbage, its population having been evacuated by [[megacorporation]] Buy-N-Large on giant [[Generation ship|starliners]] 700 years earlier. BnL has left behind WALL-E robot [[trash compactor]]s to clean up; however, all have since stopped functioning, except one unit who has gained [[sentience]] and is scavenging parts from other units to remain active. One day, WALL-E discovers a healthy [[seedling]], which he returns to his home. Later, an unmanned spaceship lands and deploys an EVE probe to scan the planet. WALL-E is infatuated with EVE, who is initially hostile but gradually befriends him. When WALL-E brings EVE to his trailer and shows her the plant, however, she suddenly takes the plant and goes into [[Sleep mode|standby mode]]. WALL-E, confused, unsuccessfully tries to reactivate her. The ship then returns to collect EVE, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner ''Axiom''.  The ''Axiom''s passengers have become [[obesity|obese]] and feeble due to [[Micro-g environment|microgravity]] and reliance on an automated lifestyle, including the ship's current captain, McCrea, who leaves the ship under the control of the robotic [[autopilot]], AUTO. EVE is taken to the bridge, with WALL-E tagging along. McCrea is unprepared for a positive probe response, but learns that placing EVE's plant in the ship's Holo-Detector for verification will trigger a [[jump drive|hyperjump]] back to Earth so humanity can recolonize it. The plant proves to be missing from EVE's storage compartment, though, and she blames WALL-E for its disappearance.  With the plant missing, EVE is deemed [[fault (technology)|faulty]] and taken to Diagnostics. WALL-E misinterprets the procedure as torture, and in intervening accidentally frees a group of malfunctioning robots and causes both EVE and himself to be designated as rogue robots. Frustrated, EVE takes WALL-E to an [[escape pod]] to send him home, but they are interrupted when GO-4 arrives with the plant, having stolen it from EVE on AUTO's orders. GO-4 places the plant in an escape pod and sets it to self-destruct, but WALL-E enters just before it is [[Jettison (aviation)|jettisoned]]. WALL-E escapes, saving the plant, and he and EVE reconcile and celebrate with a dance in space around the ''Axiom''.  EVE brings the plant back to McCrea, who watches EVE's recordings of Earth and concludes that they have to return. However, AUTO refuses, revealing his own secret no-return directive [[A113]], issued to BnL autopilots after the corporation concluded in 2110 that the planet could not be saved. AUTO [[mutiny|mutinies]], draining WALL-E's batteries and deactivating EVE, and throwing them both down the garbage chute. EVE automatically reactivates and helps WALL-E bring the plant to the ship's Holo-Detector chamber; AUTO tries to close the chamber, crushing WALL-E when he struggles to keep it open with what little battery power he had left. McCrea, seeing WALL-E's sacrifice, is inspired to challenge and deactivate AUTO and destroy GO-4 while EVE inserts the plant to activate the hyperjump.  Having arrived back on Earth, EVE repairs and recharges WALL-E, but finds that his memory has been reset and his personality is gone. Heartbroken, EVE gives WALL-E a farewell kiss, which sparks his memory back to life and restores his original personality. WALL-E and EVE reunite as the humans and robots of the ''Axiom'' begin to restore Earth and its environment.

He reveals that Wesley's father, as well as Cross, were members of the Fraternity, a society of assassins that maintains balance in the world. Sloan wants to train him so that he may help kill Cross.  A panicked Wesley leaves the building and awakens the next morning in his apartment. He discovers that his bank account now contains $3.6 million. Filled with new confidence, he insults his boss in front of the whole office and hits Barry in the face with a keyboard. Fox, waiting for Wesley, chauffeurs him to the Fraternity headquarters, a repurposed cotton mill.  Wesley trains under Fox's cruel tutelage, learning endurance, knife fighting, and hand-to-hand combat. He also learns to control and use his abilities for firearm marksmanship, such as curving bullets around targets. Frustrated by his lack of progress and the brutality of the training, Wesley insists he is ready, but Sloan disagrees. Wesley refocuses on his training and starts to excel. Sloan then shows him the Loom of Fate, which has served for 1,000 years in giving coded names of Fraternity targets through errors in the fabric. The Loom identifies those who will create evil and chaos in the future, with Sloan responsible for interpreting the code.  After several successful missions, and dumping his girlfriend with the help of Fox, Wesley has an unexpected shootout with Cross, wherein he accidentally kills the Exterminator, a Fraternity member he had befriended. Cross shoots Wesley in the shoulder. Sloan grants Wesley's wish to avenge his father and sends him after Cross—but then secretly gives Fox a mission to kill Wesley, saying that his name has come up in the Loom.  Analyzing the bullet from his shoulder, Wesley realizes that Cross had used a traceable bullet for the first time (as his previous kills were all untraceable). Wesley traces it to a man named Pekwarsky. He and Fox capture Pekwarsky, who arranges a meeting with Cross. When Wesley faces Cross alone on a moving train, Fox crashes a car into the train, causing a derailment. While Cross saves Wesley from falling, Wesley fatally shoots him. Before dying, Cross reveals that he is Wesley's real father. Fox confirms this, and explains that Wesley was recruited because he was the only person Cross would not kill. As Fox prepares to shoot Wesley, he shoots the train window below him and Cross, causing the men to free fall into the river.  Wesley is retrieved by Pekwarsky, who takes him to Cross' apartment (which is located just opposite Wesley's) and explains that Sloan started manufacturing targets for profit after discovering that he was targeted by the Loom. Cross discovered the truth, went rogue, and started killing Fraternity members to keep them away from his son. Pekwarsky departs, stating that Cross wished Wesley a life free of violence. Wesley, however, decides to kill Sloan after discovering his father's secret room, containing schematics to the Fraternity base.  Wesley attacks the base using explosive rats (a tactic he learned from the Exterminator), killing surviving Fraternity assassins in a massive shootout. Entering Sloan's office, he is surrounded by Fox, Gunsmith and the remaining assassins. Wesley discloses Sloan's deception, to which Sloan reveals that the names of those present had legitimately come up in the Loom, and that he had acted to protect them. He gives the members a choice: kill themselves, per the code, or kill Wesley and use their skills to control the world. As the others choose to kill him, Fox curves a bullet around the room, choosing to follow the code and kill everyone, including herself, but not before throwing her gun to Wesley. Sloan escapes in the mayhem.  Wesley, penniless again due to his bank account being wiped out by Sloan, returns to his desk job. Sloan arrives to kill Wesley, but is shocked when the person turns around and is revealed to be a decoy. Wesley shoots Sloan with a sniper rifle from Cross' apartment miles away. Wesley states that he is taking back control of his life before [[Fourth wall|turning to the audience]] and asking, "What the fuck have you done lately?"  
Waltz with Bashir
 In 1982, [[Ari Folman]] was a 19-year-old IDF infantry soldier. In 2006, he meets with a friend from that period, who tells him of the nightmares he's having connected to his experiences from the [[1982 Lebanon War|Lebanon War]]. Folman is surprised to find that he recalls nothing from that period. Later that night he has a vision from the night of the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]], the reality of which he is unable to clearly recall. In his memory, he and his soldier comrades are bathing at night by the seaside in [[Beirut]] under the light of flares descending over the city.  Folman rushes off to meet a childhood friend, who advises him to seek out others who were in Beirut at the same time, to understand what happened there and to revive his own memories. Folman converses with friends and other soldiers who served in the war, among others a psychologist, and Israeli TV reporter [[Ron Ben-Yishai]], who covered Beirut at the time. Folman eventually realizes that he "was in the second or third ring" of soldiers surrounding the [[Palestinian refugee camp]] where the carnage was perpetrated, and that he was among those soldiers firing flares into the sky to illuminate the refugee camp for the [[Lebanese Christian]] [[Phalange]] militia perpetrating the massacre inside. He concludes that his amnesia stemmed from his feeling as a teenage soldier that he was as guilty of the massacre as those who actually carried it out. The film ends with animation dissolving into actual footage of the aftermath of the massacre.  
War of the Worlds 2: The Next Wave
  George Herbert explains that despite years of searching for [[extraterrestrial life]], mankind never expected the invasion which devastated human civilization into anarchy, and that the [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|aliens]] were killed by a lack of immunity to the bacteria in the human blood they consumed. Two years later, a town is seen, populated with silent refugees including characters Shackleford and Sissy. Suddenly, three [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)|Tripods]] land in the city. People are struck by a [[Heat-Ray]]. Shackleford takes a sample of Sissy's blood, with which he injects himself.  In [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], American society has not recovered from the invasion. George Herbert recognises a familiar disturbance on the radio, as the same heard during the first invasion and he reveals to Major Kramer and a team of scientists that his studies show that the aliens are creating a [[wormhole]] between Earth and Mars for another wave of attacks. A fleet of fighter jets, which appear to have deep-space flight capabilities, thereby raid the planet Mars. George returns home for his son Alex, only to find a Tripod outside his home, which abducts Alex. He escapes to an abandoned city and wakes the next morning to find a man named Pete running from a Tripod. George throws himself before the machine, and wakes inside the machine with Pete. Both escape with Sissy, while the Martians begin a second invasion, attacking [[London]] and [[Paris]]. Major Kramer leads the fleet of jets to chase the alien [[mothership]] back to Mars.  George, Pete, and Sissy find themselves in the town from the start of the film; where Shackleford reveals that the town is created by the Tripods for humans captured by Tripods to live on Mars. Shackleford wants to destroy the aliens in the same way bacteria did them in during the first invasion. Shackleford and Sissy are dying of a virus lethal to the Tripods, and he convinces George to inject his infected blood into himself. George and Pete are kidnapped again and arrive inside the mothership, where they find Alex in a cocoon. There, George injects his infected blood into a pod holding a brain telepathically connected to all of the Tripods, and thus deactivates the invasion. George, Pete, and Alex escape just as the mothership explodes. George survives the infection, and the humans celebrate while listening to the radio, which undergoes some static interference, indicating a third invasion, and the characters spend a few moments in silence before the film ends.  
Walapatala
  
WarGames: The Dead Code
 Protagonist Will Farmer's ([[Matt Lanter]]) neighbor Massude asks Will for help with a computer problem. Will steals $5,000 from Massude's account to gamble on an online gaming site featuring games based on terrorist attacks. He ends up winning $25,000. The game is a sophisticated piece of [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] [[spyware]] run by an advanced [[artificial intelligence]] system called RIPLEY, designed to find terrorists.  Will later returns home to find Massude under arrest. Massude gives Will an envelope full of cash to pay for a plane ticket. Unknown to all, RIPLEY is misinterpreting the data and overreacting to the situation. On his arrival to the airport, Will finds a large number of security guards. He evades them and meets up with his friend Annie.  Will manages to crack the government network, only to be found by the police and a mysterious man in an overcoat. The couple are chased by the police until they get lost in the subway system. They escape and meet the man in the overcoat who says he nearly started [[World War III]], and to meet him at his truck. He is revealed to be Professor Falken, who had helped to design RIPLEY. They travel to a power plant outside a dam. There, Falken shows them the WOPR (War Operation Plan Response) from the original ''[[WarGames]]'' film, which now operates the power grid. Falken re-activates WOPR with his [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor password]] "Joshua". Meanwhile, RIPLEY hijacks a [[General Atomics MQ-1 Predator|Predator drone]] with missiles and a nuclear warhead on board.  Falken instructs WOPR to attack RIPLEY with a faux [[shell script|script]] full of cultural references. WOPR [[denial of service attack|floods RIPLEY's system with games]], but RIPLEY shuts down and reboots to clear the attack. RIPLEY uses the Predator drone to destroy the facility housing WOPR. Will and Annie flee the facility before it is destroyed. Falken remains in the building.  The couple is captured and taken to the room where RIPLEY is stored where they discover that Falken has transferred WOPR's program to them. They use WOPR and Internet users to stage another denial of service attack. RIPLEY attempts to self-destruct by launching a nuclear warhead at [[Washington D.C.]]. WOPR again attacks RIPLEY, playing through two nuclear attack scenarios that result in total annihilation. The third scenario presented is a nuclear attack on Washington D.C. Having learned the concept of futility, RIPLEY stops responding after the scenario is played out.  After RIPLEY relinquishes control, Will asks WOPR if he really would have launched the missiles if RIPLEY had decided to continue playing.  WOPR replies, "Yes, the human race is finished." before revealing, "That was humor."  
The Wave (2008 film)
 A school teacher of history, Rainer Wenger, is forced to teach a class on [[autocracy]], despite being an [[Anarchy|anarchist]]. When his students, third generation after the [[World War II|Second World War]],<ref>Jeff Dawson ''...salutes a hit German film ...'' ''[[Sunday Times]]'' 31 Aug 2008</ref> do not believe that a dictatorship could be established in modern Germany, he starts an experiment to demonstrate how easily the masses can be manipulated. He begins by demanding that all students address him as "Herr Wenger", as opposed to Rainer<ref>Note: This is actually the usual way for German students to address teachers. In itself, it is not specifically authoritarian; in this case, it means that Rainer Wenger had ''before'' been a highly unusally informal teacher who changes that policy now.</ref>, and places students with poor grades beside students with good grades—purportedly so they can learn from one another and become better as a whole. When speaking, they must stand and give short, direct answers. Wenger shows his students the effect of marching together in the same rhythm, motivating them by suggesting that they could really annoy the anarchy class, which is below them. Wenger suggests a uniform, to remove class distinction and further unite the group. Mona argues it will remove individuality, as well. Karo shows up to class without the uniform and is ostracized. The students decide among themselves they need a name, deciding on "Die Welle" (The Wave). Karo suggests another name, which ends up with one single vote cast by herself.  The group is shown to grow closer and the bully Simon is shown to reform, protecting a classmate from other bullies. He also creates a distinctive salute for the group. Karo and Mona protest the actions of the group, and Mona, disgusted with how her classmates are embracing fascism, leaves the project group. The other classmates don't see her departure as a connection with fascism and continue attending. The members of The Wave begin spray-painting their logo around town at night, having parties where only Wave members are allowed to attend, and ostracizing and tormenting anyone not in their group. Tim becomes very attached to the group, having finally become an accepted member of a social group. He burns his brand clothes, after a discussion about how large corporations do not take responsibility for their actions.  A pair of punks start a fight with Tim, but he is saved by Bomber and Sinan and starts to bond with them. When Tim and his group of new friends are confronted by a group of angry punks (including those that Tim faced previously), Tim pulls a [[Walther PP]] pistol, causing them to back down. Tim explains to his shocked friends that the pistol only fires blanks. Tim later shows up at Wenger's house, offering to be his bodyguard. Wenger declines his offer but invites Tim in for dinner. This puts further strain on Wenger's already tense relationship with his wife, Anke, who thinks his experiment has gone too far. Wenger finally ejects Tim from his house, only to find in the morning that the boy had slept on his doorstep. Anke is upset upon learning of this, and tells Wenger to stop the experiment immediately. He accuses her of being jealous and insults her dependency on pills to be able to show up to work. Shocked, she leaves him, saying The Wave has made him a bad person.  Karo continues her opposition to The Wave, earning the anger of many in the group, who ask her boyfriend, Marco, to do something about it. A water polo competition is due that day, and Wenger asks The Wave to show up in support of the team. Karo and Mona, denied entry to the competition by members of The Wave, sneak in another way to distribute anti-Wave fliers. Members of The Wave notice this and scramble to retrieve the papers before anybody reads them. In the chaos, Sinan starts a fight with an opposing team member, the two almost drowning each other. Members of The Wave in the stands begin to violently shove one another. After the match, Marco confronts Karo and accuses her of causing the fight. She replies that The Wave has brainwashed him completely, and he slaps Karo, causing her to get a nosebleed. Unsettled by his own behavior, Marco approaches Wenger and asks him to stop the project. Wenger agrees and calls a meeting of all The Wave members for the following day in the school's auditorium.  Once in the meeting, Wenger has the doors locked and begins whipping the students into a fervor. When Marco protests, Wenger calls him a traitor and orders the students to bring him to the stage for punishment. Wenger uses this to force the students to see how extreme the Wave has become. Wenger declares he is disbanding the Wave, but Dennis argues that they should try to salvage the good parts of the movement. Wenger points out that there is no way to remove the negative elements from fascism. Tim draws a gun and refuses to accept the Wave is over, fearing that he will once more be lonely and states that the Wave is his life. When Bomber says the gun only fires blanks, Tim shoots him to prove the pistol has live rounds. Wenger tries to calm Tim, who is now aiming the gun at him. When Tim demands why he shouldn't shoot Wenger too, Wenger says that without him, there would be no one to lead The Wave. Tim abruptly shoots himself instead, preferring to commit suicide rather than go on living without The Wave. Wenger cradles his corpse and looks helplessly at his now traumatized students. The film ends with Wenger being arrested by the police and driven away, Bomber being taken away to the hospital, and Marco and Karo being re-united. The final images show Wenger in the back of a police car, staring into the camera overcome with distress.

Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins
  Dr. R.J. (Roscoe) Stevens ([[Martin Lawrence]]) is a talk-show sensation who has discarded his simple Southern awkward-boy past and the awkward boy he used to be to dispense motivational advice to millions of adoring fans. With [[reality TV]] series ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' winner, Bianca Kittles ([[Joy Bryant]]) on his arm and enough cash in his pocket to easily afford expensive gifts for his parents, he feels like there's nothing he hasn't achieved.  When his parents request that he come home for their 50th wedding anniversary, R.J. packs up his 10-year-old son, Jamaal (Damani Roberts) and his fiancée, Bianca and heads back to his sleepy Southern hometown. Ready to impress his down-home kin with how much he’s changed, R.J. will prove he’s no longer the walking disaster they used to pick on. When they arrive in Georgia, he is first greeted by his pick pocketing cousin, Reggie ([[Mike Epps]]), who asks him for $300 to buy ice for the family barbecue. At the family home, Roscoe is greeted by his parents, Roscoe Sr. ([[James Earl Jones]]) and Mama Jenkins ([[Margaret Avery]]); his brother, Otis ([[Michael Clarke Duncan]]), the town sheriff; Otis' wife, Ruthie (Liz Mikel) and their overgrown kids, Junior (Brandin Jenkins) and Callie (Krystal Marea Braud); and Roscoe's loud, rowdy sister, Betty ([[Mo'Nique]]). Before long, Roscoe's cousin, Clyde ([[Cedric the Entertainer]]) drops in, bringing the old spark of competition with Roscoe, he is also escorting Lucinda ([[Nicole Ari Parker]]), a past love interest of Roscoe's.  During the visit, Roscoe endures much self-humiliation such as accidentally hitting his mother in the head with a softball during a softball game, getting beaten up by Otis and Betty after he insults them, constantly getting blackmailed by Reggie, and getting sprayed by a skunk while sleeping. It becomes obvious that he still holds a grudge against his father for how he treated him when he was younger such as showing such preference for Clyde that he wouldn't even fully discipline him. Roscoe Sr. resents his son for changing his name and distancing himself from his family. Meanwhile, Bianca doesn't fit in well with the family and Roscoe and Lucinda get reacquainted.  On the day of the Jenkins' anniversary, the whole family gathers for the traditional Jenkins-family obstacle course. Roscoe is determined to defeat Clyde when he challenges him and the two become even more competitive. As the race begins, Roscoe and Clyde aggressively make their way through the obstacles, sometimes hurting themselves and other contestants. While climbing over a wall with ropes, Roscoe begins to help his son over, but Bianca tells him to leave him and he does, much to his parents' shock. Roscoe and Clyde race to the finish line, and Roscoe wins. As Bianca cheers for him, Roscoe, overjoyed by the victory, begins to berate everyone reminding them that it is all about "the team of me" (him). The family is angry about his actions during the obstacle course, Jamaal refuses to go near his father, and Roscoe Sr. chastises his son. Unable to contain his resentment, Roscoe lashes out at his father, saying that although Clyde's father died, Roscoe felt he lost his father because he favored Clyde over him and chastises him for always crediting Clyde for things he's done while never acknowledging any of his successes or accomplishments. Stunned and distraught by this admission, Roscoe Sr. walks away; feeling hurt. Clyde walks up to Roscoe and says he never tried to take his place. He tries to shake Roscoe's hand to make amends, but Bianca tells him to back off, and Roscoe decides he, Bianca, and Jamaal should start for home. Before he leaves, his mother reminds him that his family still loves him. As they drive to the airport, Bianca proposes not inviting the family to their wedding. Roscoe seems to agree, which upsets Jamaal and despite Bianca wanting him to get on board the "Team of Me," he proudly declares himself a Jenkins. Bianca continues to say mean things about the Jenkins clan and Roscoe pretends to agree with her, but at the airport, he thanks her for finally letting him see her true colors and then he dumps her. Angrily, feeling humiliated by Roscoe and Jamaal, she gets out of the car. As they pull away from the airport, he pulls the rope holding her bags on top of the car; dumping them into the airport driveway. Roscoe and Jamaal head back to the family home; keeping Bianca's pet Pomeranian Fifi, who had turned against Bianca and joined the Jenkins clan to pursue a relationship with the family's over-aged dog, Bucky (25 in dog years = 175 in human years).  During the anniversary celebration, Clyde cries during his speech for Mama and Papa Jenkins; admitting that he cared a lot about Roscoe. Roscoe suddenly appears, apologizes to his family, and congratulates his parents. He and his father make amends, then Roscoe asks Lucinda to dance. After the celebration, the family watches it on a hi-def television while Roscoe and Lucinda make love—but find a nasty surprise (Bucky and Fifi in his bedroom having had intercourse like before). During the credits, Roscoe is seen interviewing his family on his show, renamed ''The Roscoe Jenkins Show''.

Welcome to the Sticks
 Philippe Abrams is the manager of the [[post office|postal service]] ([[La Poste (France)|La Poste]]) in [[Salon-de-Provence]], [[Bouches-du-Rhône]], in southern France. He is married to Julie, whose depressive character makes his life miserable. Philippe does everything to get a job at an office on the Mediterranean seaside to make her happy. As this favorable position will be granted to somebody who is disabled, Abrams decides to pretend that he is. However, the management finds out. As punishment, he is banished for two years to [[Bergues]], a town near [[Dunkirk]] in northern [[France]]. Northern France – and the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] region in particular – is considered [[boondocks|"the sticks"]] – a cold and rainy place inhabited by unsophisticated ''ch'tis'' who speak a strange language (called "[[Picard language|''ch'ti'']]" in local parlance, and "''cheutimi''" in the South). He has to spend his first night at the home of Antoine, a co-worker of his. Philippe initially dislikes Antoine for his obnoxious behavior and because he initially thinks Antoine is gay (he found photographs of Antoine dressed as a woman, but they were taken during a carnival party and Antoine admits to doing more than dressing as a woman during that time). However, Antoine and Philippe later become best friends.  To Philippe's surprise, Bergues proves to be a charming place teeming with warm, friendly people and co-workers. Soon, he is completely won over, eating smelly [[Maroilles (cheese)|Maroilles cheese]]; talking to virtually every local (by delivering their mail, and accepting the recipient's invitation for a drink); playing at the beach; playing the [[carillon]] at the [[bell tower]] together, drinking beer like a local, going to an [[RC Lens]] football match and so forth. He tries to describe the happy turn of events to his wife who has remained in the South with their young son, but she does not believe him. This inspires Philippe to tell her what she wants to believe: that his life is wretched there.  Everything goes fine until Julie decides to join him in the North to relieve his gloom. Philippe is forced to confess to his new friends and colleagues that he has described them as barbarians to his wife. First, they are angry, but they then decide to help him by behaving as such to cover for his lies and to scare Julie so she will depart quickly. Also they let her stay in the old mining place of Bergues, pretending it is the main town. Julie has a very bad weekend, but decides she will move to Bergues to stay with Philippe, to be supportive.  Just when she's ready to go back south, she discovers that she has been tricked when a local biker tells Julie that the actual town of Bergues is several kilometers away. When Philippe finds Julie at his real Bergues home, he tells her the truth about the happiness and friendship that the town has brought him. Julie is disappointed at first, but after realizing her husband is happy, she decides to move north to be with him.  Meanwhile, Antoine and Annabelle had been dating for over a year, but  had broken up due to Antoine's passiveness towards his overbearing mother. Despite their split, Antoine still has feelings for Annabelle, who now has a new boyfriend. Upon learning this, Antoine cheers himself up by drinking alcohol during his work hours and behaves in an erratic manner. When Philippe urges Antoine to take courage and be [[Assertiveness|assertive]], Antoine finally confesses to his mother that he loves Annabelle and is planning to move to a new place with her. Unexpectedly, his mother is happy about it – she has waited all these years for Antoine to stand up for himself. As a result, Antoine proposes to Annabelle by the bell tower when it is playing [[I Just Called to Say I Love You|a Stevie Wonder song]]. Annabelle accepts, and they get married.  Three years later, Philippe receives a transfer to move south. Accepting the offer, Philippe and his family move south. Just as he is about to say goodbye, he is reduced to tears, proving Antoine's theory on the Ch'tis proverb ("A visitor brays [cries] twice up north: once on his arrival and once at his departure.")  
Were the World Mine
 Timothy ([[Tanner Cohen]]) is an openly gay student at a private boys' school. Although now in his senior year, he is still persecuted by the aggressive [[rugby football|rugby]] team, on whose captain, Jonathon ([[Nathaniel David Becker]]), he has a crush. Timothy lives with his mother, Donna (Judy McLane), who is struggling with her son's [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]] and with getting a job, and his father who is not a part of his life.  Timothy is cast as [[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]] in the senior production of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. While reviewing his lines, he discovers the recipe for creating the flower [[love-in-idleness]]. Timothy uses the flower to have the [[Homophobia|homophobic]] town take a "walk in his shoes". The entire town is thrown into chaos as previously heterosexual community members fall in love with their same-sex friends, bosses, and co-workers: whomever they first saw after being sprayed by the flower. The school drama teacher, Ms. Tebbit ([[Wendy Robie]]), guides Timothy towards the question of whether his actions have caused more harm than good.  
A Wednesday!
 [[Mumbai]] police commissioner Prakash Rathod ([[Anupam Kher]]), resting after a jog, describes in a [[voice-over]] that he is going to retire the following day. He goes on to describe the most challenging case he faced in his career.  An unnamed man ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]) carries a travel bag, assumed to contain explosives, in the [[Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus]] railway station and proceeds to hide the bag in the restroom of a [[police station]] opposite to the [[Mumbai Police]] headquarters. He then arrives on the rooftop of a building under construction where he has set up his base of operations, equipped with several sim cards, mobile phones and other electronic gadgets. He calls Rathod and informs him that he has placed five bombs in locations throughout Mumbai and has programmed them to explode simultaneously within four hours unless the Commissioner gives in to his demands and releases four [[Insurgent|militants]]. In response, Rathod immediately alerts his team involved in intelligence research and surveillance, tapping all the available resources to trace the location of the caller. Meanwhile, the caller tips off television news reporter Naina Roy ([[Deepal Shaw]]), telling her to reach the police headquarters immediately as it is going to be "the most important day of her life". Rathod initially suspects the anonymous caller is bluffing, but his doubts are dispelled as the caller, to prove his seriousness and the police force's helplessness, reveals that a bomb has been planted in the Colaba Police Station right across the Police Headquarter. He further scares them by calling the cell phone attached to the bomb but does not detonate the bomb. Just then Roy reaches the scene on the caller's instructions and reports about the situation.  As Rathod and his team desperately try to locate the caller, the four militants demanded by the caller are rounded up by police officers Arif ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) and Jai ([[Aamir Bashir]]). In the meanwhile, police depute a young hacker named Anuj to track the location of the caller. The caller then asks the two police officers to leave the four militants near a bench on an [[Juhu Aerodrome|Juhu Aviation Base]] runway, but Arif leaves only three militants behind and takes one of them captive as he suspects that the caller would not reveal the locations of the bombs even after the militants are released.  A phone placed under the bench rings once Arif and Jai are several feet away and an explosion occurs in which the three terrorists perish. Arif relays this information to Rathod, and the anonymous caller reveals he does not belong to any terrorist organization, and his plan was not to free the terrorists but to kill them. The caller sought to avenge all the terrorist attacks they had helped carry out in Mumbai and other major cities of India, specifically the [[2006 Mumbai train bombings]]. His final demand is that the officers kill the fourth militant themselves or he would set off all five bombs in Mumbai. In response, Rathod orders indirectly to Arif and Jai to kill the fourth militant.  After the death of the fourth militant is confirmed on the news, the caller calls Rathod for a final time to reveal that he had not planted any other bombs in the city. At this point, Rathod declares he already knew there were no more bombs, hence his decision to kill the last terrorist was not taken in fear but in confidence. Rathod reaches the caller's location with the help of the young hacker, just as the caller is leaving the place, having destroyed all his gadgets and equipment. The two meet briefly when Rathod, identifying the anonymous caller on the basis of a face sketch, offers the man a ride home and introduces himself.  In a voiceover, Rathod says the man told him his real name but he does not wish to reveal it since doing so would give away the man's religion. Rathod admits that he knew the caller was disturbed because of the insecure environment and the incompetence of the governing authorities, but he never imagined a common man would go to such lengths to achieve this end. He also notes that the facts of this incident cannot be found in any written record but only in the memories of those who actually witnessed it, and further acknowledges that although the incident has ambiguous moral significance, he personally feels that whatever happened, happened for the best.

While She Was Out
 On [[Christmas Eve]], suburban housewife Della Myers gets into an argument with her abusive husband Kenneth. After putting her two children to bed, she drives to the mall to buy some wrapping paper and cards.  At the mall, she can't find a parking space for a while and angrily leaves a note on the window of a car that is parked using up two parking spaces. She leaves the store as the mall is closing, and the parking lot is nearly deserted. She notices the note is gone from the 'offending' car. As she enters her own car, the car on which she had left the note pulls up behind her.  She confronts the car, and four young men emerge—Huey, Vingh, and Tomás—led by Chuckie. They threaten to rape her. Della insults Chuckie, and a security guard intervenes, but he is shot dead by Chuckie. As the gang realizes that they have committed a [[murder]], Della manages to start her car and drive away. They follow her, intending to kill her, as she is the only witness. As they pursue her some distance, she eventually crashes her car in a deserted area where homes are under construction. She takes a road flare and a toolbox out of her car and hides behind a [[backhoe]].   Della runs through the buildings under construction to hide as they search for her. After some time, the thugs corner and threaten her by name, as they had found her drivers license in her purse in her car. As they have her open the toolbox, she hits Chuckie with a crescent wrench, and escapes again into some nearby woods. In the process of chasing her, Tomás accidentally steps on Huey, who falls through a construction site and dies from a broken neck.  After some hide and seek in the woods, Della beats and finally kills Tomás with a [[lug wrench]]. She flees through a creek, pursued by Chuckie and Vingh. Della sneaks up on Vingh and kills him with a screwdriver and hides behind a fallen tree. Chuckie tries to persuade Della to give up; he talks about her kids, saying that he is going to pay them a visit. He tells her what he thinks of her, that she lives a boring life she doesn't want, mistreated by her husband. He finds her, touches, and teases her face. She holds his hand, pulls him down and they kiss. He draws his weapon as they engage in foreplay. She tells him to have sex with her, and as he is distracted she ignites the road flare and blinds him, takes his weapon, and kills him.   Della returns home. Her husband Kenneth complains she was out late and is tracking mud throughout the house, but Della ignores him. She goes upstairs to check on her children who are both sleeping. The drunk Kenneth asks what she brought him from the mall, and she replies, "Nothing", and points the gun at him.  
What Just Happened
 Ben ([[Robert De Niro]]), a veteran [[Hollywood]] producer, is suffering a number of professional and personal problems. His latest film, ''Fiercely'', has a disastrous test screening, mostly because of its ending which features the murder of its main character (played by [[Sean Penn]], who plays himself elsewhere in the film) along with his pet dog.  Ben and his maverick [[United Kingdom|British]] director, Jeremy Brunell ([[Michael Wincott]]), plead their case to studio executive Lou Tarnow ([[Catherine Keener]]). She accuses Ben of filming the dog's killing only so he could use it as a "bargaining chip" - to make it easier to negotiate against cutting other problematic scenes. Lou threatens to pull Ben's movie from [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] and take over editing unless at least the dog's death is removed. Jeremy adamantly refuses, throwing a tantrum.  Adding to Ben's problems, he is having trouble making a clean break from Kelly, his second wife. Ben later discovers his wife is having an affair with Scott Solomon, a married screenwriter who Ben has previously worked with. Scott has a screenplay that he's trying to get off the ground, to which [[Brad Pitt]] later becomes attached.    Lastly the studio is threatening to cancel a planned [[Bruce Willis]] movie because of the star's unwillingness to shave the large, thick beard that he has grown. Ben's career hinges on the fate of the film, but any attempt to reason with Willis inevitably meets a violent, foul-mouthed response.  Ultimately Jeremy relents and re-edits the ending of ''Fiercely'' to have the dog survive. Ben tries to get Willis's agent, Dick Bell, to reason with him and get the beard removed, but his efforts only get Ben fired. Nonetheless, Willis does eventually shave his beard off, and the film goes ahead.  A week later, Ben, Lou and Jeremy attend Cannes, hopeful that they might take a [[Palme D'Or]] award. Unfortunately, and without telling Ben or Lou, Jeremy has re-edited ''Fiercely'' again, not only killing the dog, but adding nearly a full minute of bullets being shot into their bodies. While the new ending destroys the film's chances of a Palme d'Or and angers many in the audience, others eagerly applaud the final version of the film, including Sean Penn (playing himself). Lou is not impressed, and immediately flies out of Cannes on the studio's private jet, leaving Ben stranded in [[France]].  Ben eventually does make it back home, in time for a photo-shoot of Hollywood's top thirty producers with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', although after the magazine's publishers hear about the debacle in Cannes, Ben is relegated to the far edge of the photo, meaning he will be barely noticeable.  
What Happens in Vegas
 In New York City, high-strung equity trader Joy Ellis McNally is dumped by her fiancé at a surprise birthday party she throws for him. At the same time, easy-going carpenter Jack Fuller is fired from his job by his father, Jack, Sr. Both become emotionally distraught and, with best friends Toni "Tipper", a bartender, and Jeff "Hater", a lawyer, take a debauched trip to Las Vegas.  Joy and Jack meet by chance when they are given the same hotel room because of a computer error. After clearing up the misunderstanding and receiving upgraded rooms and coupons to various clubs, they party and drink together and end up getting married. The next morning, they realize it was a mistake and decide to divorce.  Before they do so, Jack uses a quarter Joy gives him in a slot machine. He hits a three million dollar jackpot and Joy reminds Jack that they are married and hence, she is entitled to half of the money. The couple return to New York, where they attempt to divorce. The judge declares that the couple cannot divorce until they attempt to co-exist for six months, while attending weekly sessions with Dr. Twitchell, a marriage counselor. If they work at the marriage but still want to divorce after six months, each will be permitted to keep half the winnings. If either party does not cooperate, the money will be tied up in litigation by the judge.  The newlyweds devise more and more cunning schemes to undermine each other, such as Jack telling Joy that their counseling session is canceled to prove she's not committed, and Joy inviting girls to their apartment to try to get Jack to cheat on her, throwing a party where Jack's friend Dave shows up. Jack gives Joy's ex-fiancé, Mason, her engagement ring back without Joy knowing. At Joy's job retreat, Jack and Joy find themselves developing an unexpected attraction to one another, and they soon realize that being with each other has brought out the best in both of them.  After they get back from the retreat, it's time for the judge to decide what happens to the money. On her way to the hearing, Joy sees her ex-fiancé Mason, and he tells her that he wants her back. He gives her back the engagement ring and tells her that she is good enough for him. Joy realizes that Jack set her up to get back with him, therefore cheating on him and letting Jack keep the money. Joy walks away from Mason and goes to the hearing. At the hearing, their marriage counselor testifies that the couple truly tried to work on their marriage. The judge decides that they will split the remaining 1.4 million dollars (after taxes, bills Joy ran up, and money Jack spent on his new woodworking business). Joy tells the judge she doesn't want any money and gives the engagement ring to Jack, telling him she officially doesn't want anything from him. Jack realizes she knows that he talked to Mason.  Joy gets the promotion she'd been working for, but tells her boss she would rather be happy doing nothing than doing something she hates and being miserable. Jack talks to his parents and they tell him it looks like he and Joy are in love. Realizing his mistake, he goes to find her. Tipper tells Jack that she quit her job and that nobody knows where she is. He has a suspicion that she has gone to a beach (Fire Island, New York) that she told him about, the only place that makes her feel truly happy. Jack asks her to be his wife (again) and she says yes. As the two embrace, Joy says that she quit her job and has no idea what she's going to do. Jack reminds her that they have a lot of money between them. Joy states that they hit the jackpot, to which Jack replies that he certainly did (referring to both the money and to Joy).  === Epilogue === During the credits, we see Tipper and Hater on the day Jack and Joy get married. Tipper and Hater subsequently enact a plan of revenge on Mason, devised by Tipper earlier in the film. Tipper and Hater ring Mason's doorbell, and when he answers, Tipper slugs him in his testicles. He moans in agony and drops to his knees asking "Why?", and she responds emphatically "You know why!", and Tipper leaves with Hater.<ref></ref>  Post-credits, Dave is telling Hater about a party that evening, but Hater no longer wants to associate with Dave, citing Jack as being "the glue" that held the two of them together as friends. With that, Hater simply leaves. Dave asks a random guy on the street if he likes to party.

His two friends, Wyatt ([[Kenan Thompson]]) and Ben ([[Zachary Levi]]), a closeted gay man, take him on a road trip to lift his spirits and take revenge on Dr. Dwayne.  The friends take their trip in Wyatt's van, which he has customized into a cross-country hotdog stand called the weinerwagon in an attempt to impress Oscar Mayer and get a job with them.    On the way, they encounter an elderly [[Hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]] couple Frank and Felicia Applebaum (Blake Clark and Mindy Sterling) who had [[sexual intercourse]] in front of them. After being dropped off, Mr Applebaum says "Next time bring Da noise or Da Funk" and does a break dance in front of them. They realized their wallets are stolen by three women, leaving them with only ten dollars delivered to Wyatt in a 15-year-old [[birthday card]] from his grandmother.

Wild Child (film)
  Poppy Moore ([[Emma Roberts]]), an [[Wealth|affluent]] [[California]]n teenager, executes a wild prank to ruin all of her father's girlfriend's belongings in front of her friends, telling everyone to throw away whatever they want and take it for themselves. When her father Gerry ([[Aidan Quinn]]) arrives on the scene, he announces that he is sending her to a [[boarding school]] in [[England]]. Arriving at the school, Abbey Mount, Poppy meets the headmistress Mrs. Kingsley ([[Natasha Richardson]]), who she initially finds annoying; head girl Harriet Bentley ([[Georgia King]]), a tall, bossy girl who has two so-called "friends" named Jane and Charlotte that she treats like slaves, who follow her around, beg for her and agree with whatever she says; her "big sister", Kate ([[Kimberley Nixon]]), and roommates Josie ([[Linzey Cocker]]), Kiki ([[Sophie Wu]]) and Jennifer "Drippy" ([[Juno Temple]]). Poppy's entire suitcase is left out in the rain, soaking everything. She meets the Matron and orders her to wash, dry and iron all her clothes. This lands the girls with three Sunday's [[School detention|detention]], leaving her with no friends and her dormmates expressing their hate to her. She is miserable in her new life, feeling that she does not fit in as an outsider.  After a small fight with Harriet in gym class, Poppy is called to the Headmistress' Office, where she is given a punishment: read a book. Sitting on a bench outside sulking, Harriet spots her and orders her "maid", an intimidated Year 7 student, to drench Poppy with dirty coffee-filled water that was being used to age Harriet's [[Keira Knightley]] costume for the school dance, but this ultimately results in Poppy and Kate starting to form a friendship. Revealing that the girls' mobile phones, confiscated earlier on, were always intended to be decoys, Kate lets Poppy use her actual phone to call her friend Ruby ([[Shelby Young]]) in the US. However, when Ruby sees Poppy's message, she is disgusted and it is revealed that Poppy's boyfriend, Roddy ([[Johnny Pacar]]), has been cheating on Poppy with her.  After Poppy reveals that her mother died several years ago in a car accident, her roommates decide to help her get expelled so that she can return home. Together they carry out several pranks, which gradually bring them closer together. When none of their plans work, they decide to [[seduce]] the headmistress's son, Freddie, who is strictly forbidden from [[fraternization|fraternizing]] with any of the girls. She dances with Freddy at the school dance, much to Harriet's dismay, but Poppy trips and hits her head. This prompts Freddie to take the [[concussion|concussed]] girl outside for air, where he asks her out on a date.   The next day, Poppy discovers her talent for [[lacrosse]] and whips the school's team into shape, getting them into the finals. On the date, Poppy finds herself falling for Freddie. They kiss before returning to school. Entering her room, Poppy finds her roommates reading an [[email]] supposedly sent by herself, expressing that she thinks all of her new friends are losers. She then finds that Freddie has been sent a similar email and is thereafter ignored by all of her friends. With no one else to turn to, Poppy sneaks down to the cook's room and calls Ruby. Ruby, however, accidentally reveals how much she dislikes Poppy and the fact that she is seeing Poppy's boyfriend. Feeling even more alone, Poppy starts playing with her lighter and accidentally sets a curtain on fire. Hearing footsteps, she quickly puts out the fire and runs off. A few minutes later, she looks out her window to see a fire and immediately wakes the school.  When they find that Drippy is missing, Poppy runs into the burning school to rescue her. After the fire is put out, Freddie finds her lighter and gives it back to her, refusing to listen to what happened. Just as she realizes that she no longer wants to leave, Poppy goes to the headmistress and confesses. Afterwards, she finds a portrait of her mother in the 1976 Abbey Mount lacrosse team and begins to cry upon realizing that her mother also attended the school.  While Poppy waits for the Honour Court to decide if she should be expelled, Freddie finds her crying and becomes convinced that the fire was an accident and forgives her. During the hearing, Poppy tells her story. Meanwhile, her roommates find out that Poppy did not send the emails. Going to the Court, they stand up for Poppy, and Harriet accidentally confesses to restarting the fire after Poppy had put it out when she mentions Poppy's lighter, a fact not previously mentioned in the trial. Poppy is subsequently absolved. Poppy's father comes to the game of the lacrosse finals, and is shocked by Poppy's dramatic change in appearance and how much she looks like her mother, also captain of the lacrosse team at Abbey Mount. Abbey Mount wins the lacrosse finals and Harriet is expelled. Some months later, Poppy and her friends (including Freddie) are shown relaxing in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. Poppy ignores Ruby's phone calls, now fully aware that she was not the friend she thought she was. The film ends as they prepare to jump off the cliff that helped her towards finding herself and making proper friends.  
The Wild Man of the Navidad
  This film is allegedly based on the real-life journals of [[Dale S. Rogers]], a man who, in the 1970s, lived along the banks of the [[Navidad River]] in [[Sublime, Texas]] - the same area where [[Wild Man of the Navidad|the original legend of the Wild Man of the Navidad]] surfaced back in the late 1800s.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The film follows Dale, his wheelchair-using wife Jean, and her oft-shirtless, lazy-eyed caretaker Mario. Though their ranch sits on vast acres prime for paying hunters, Dale has resisted opening up the land because of the strange, [[Bigfoot]]-like creatures supposedly inhabiting it. But after the prodding of some of the rifle-loving townsfolk and the loss of his welding job, Dale gives in and opens the gate to his compound. Then the hunters become the hunted.<ref>[http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/blog/2008/04/tribeca-director-interview-justin-meeks.php] </ref>

 The film is about a teenage Dutch boy, named Michiel van Beusekom, who tries to assist the [[Dutch resistance]] during [[World War II]] by helping a British airman stay out of German hands during the [[Netherlands in World War II|Nazi occupation of the Netherlands]].  Michiel feels resentment towards his father, the mayor, who is seemingly only interested in maintaining the status quo between the town and the German Army. However, Michiel worships his Uncle Ben, an adventurer in contact with the local resistance. During the winter of 1944-1945,<ref>{{cite news|title=Movie review - ''Winter in Wartime'': A boy, a wounded airman and an over-the-top plot|author=Groen, Rick |newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=April 1, 2011 | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/winter-in-wartime-a-boy-a-wounded-airman-and-an-over-the-top-plot/article628388/}}</ref> Michiel's loyalties are tested.  An [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[de Havilland Mosquito]] is hit in the air and crashes, but before it hits the ground, a young British airman is able to escape by parachute.  One of the villagers, Dirk (the elder brother of Michiel's best friend), helps the airman, Jack, but Dirk is later arrested. Before his arrest, Dirk gives Michiel a letter to be delivered to Bertus, the village blacksmith. Before Michiel can deliver the letter, Bertus is shot and killed by the Germans.  Michiel opens the letter, which directs him to Jack's hiding place in the forest. Jack is injured, and Michiel enlists the aid of his sister Erica, a nurse, to take care of him. Jack and Erica soon develop a romantic relationship.  Michiel's father is arrested when the body of a German soldier, killed by Jack on the night of the plane crash, is found in the forest. Jack wants to turn himself in to save Michiel's father, but Ben tells Michiel he (Ben) can save his father. However, Ben's efforts fail, and Michiel's father is shot by the Germans along with two other men as reprisal for the death of the soldier killed by Jack.  Michiel tries to take Jack to the town of [[Zwolle]], across a river, but the Germans foil their attempt, and the two narrowly escape after a chase through the forest. Michiel finally turns to his Uncle Ben for help in getting Jack to Zwolle. Ben agrees, and Ben, Jack, and Erica set off for the bridge to Zwolle. As they leave, Ben tells Michiel that Dirk should never have gotten Michiel involved with Jack. After they go, Michiel realizes that he had never mentioned Dirk's role to Ben. Quickly checking Ben's suitcase, he finds papers showing that Ben is working for the Germans.  Rushing to the river, Michiel stops the trio, grabs Jack's pistol, and confronts Ben. While Michiel guards Ben, Jack and Erica succeed in making it across the river to Zwolle. Ben tells Michiel that he had arranged for his father to be released, but that his father refused to let another villager be shot in his place. Ben attempts to escape to a passing German patrol, but Michiel shoots and kills him.  A few months later, Allied soldiers enter the village and are rapturously welcomed by the villagers. One of the soldiers brings a letter for Erica, presumably from Jack. Michiel hesitates to join in the celebrations after all that has happened, but finally joins in.

The Carpet of Wood
 We are in a village in the Kermanshah region, on the border between Iran and Iraq. This territory, at the foot of Mounts Zagros at about 1,400 metres altitude, is very poor and isolated.

The documentary film narrates, step by step, every small effort made by all the inhabitants of the village, whether they are men, women, elderly people or children.

As he wrestles, Randy begins to feel chest pain and becomes unsteady. The Ayatollah notices this and urges him to initiate the [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pin]].

The X-Files: I Want to Believe
 [[Dana Scully]], a former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent, is now a staff physician at a [[Catholic]] hospital; she is treating Christian, a young boy with symptoms similar to [[Sandhoff disease]]. FBI agent Mosely Drummy approaches Scully for help in locating her former partner, [[Fox Mulder]], who has been in hiding as a fugitive for several years. Drummy states that the FBI will call off its manhunt for Mulder if he helps investigate the disappearances of several women in West Virginia, the latest of whom is a young FBI agent named Monica Bannan. Scully agrees and convinces a reluctant Mulder to help.  The duo are taken to [[Washington, D.C.]], where Agent Dakota Whitney requests Mulder's expertise with the paranormal as they have been led to a clue, a severed human arm, by Father Joseph Fitzpatrick Crissman. He is a former priest defrocked for the molestation of thirty-seven altar boys, and claims God is sending him visions of the crimes. A second woman, driving home after swimming in a [[natatorium]], is run off the road by a truck driven by Janke Dacyshyn, who then abducts her. Father Joe is again recruited for help with the second abducted woman. After a grueling nighttime search in a snow-covered field, he leads the FBI to what turns out to be a frozen burial ground of people and body parts. Analysis of the remains, along with tracking down the recent movements from the second abducted woman's car crash, eventually leads them to Dacyshyn, an organ transporter in Richmond, Virginia, and his husband, Franz Tomczeszyn, who was among the youths Father Joe sexually abused.  During an FBI raid on the organ donor facility where Dacyshyn works, he ends up escaping, leaving Bannan's severed head at the scene. Mulder, who accompanied Whitney on the raid, chases Dacyshyn to a building construction site. Whitney follows, and is killed when Dacyshyn pushes her down an elevator shaft. Scully, seeking a resolution, asks Joe, who has not yet heard of the discovery of Bannan's head, if he senses that she is still alive. He replies that she is. Discouraged but still determined, Mulder decides to investigate the incidents further. He starts by driving Scully's car to Nutter's Feed Store in a small town near the abductions, as the human remains contain [[acepromazine]], an animal tranquilizer. When Dacyshyn coincidentally arrives moments later, Mulder slips out and follows him. Dacyshyn notices him, however, and runs his car off the road. Mulder survives and manages to tail Dacyshyn, who exits his truck after the engine fails, to a small compound in a former barn. Mulder enters, and the commotion caused by a two-headed guard dog brings Dacyshyn out from one of the buildings. The compound is being used by an east-European medical team that has been murdering people and stealing their organs for years. The field where Father Joe had earlier discovered the bodies turned out to be their dumping ground. Mulder enters the building to find that the team has been using the organs and body parts in an attempt to keep Tomczeszyn alive. At that moment, they attempt to [[Head transplant|place Tomczeszyn's head]] on the body of the second abducted woman. Mulder tries to save her from the gruesome fate, but a doctor comes from behind and injects him with a tranquilizer. Helpless, Mulder is taken outside to be murdered by Dacyshyn.  Scully, unable to reach Mulder on his cell phone, contacts her old FBI superior, [[Walter Skinner]], for help. They triangulate the phone's location and find Scully's wrecked car, eventually making their way through the snow to find the compound as Mulder is about to be axed by Dacyshyn. Scully attacks him in an ensuing confrontation, incapacitating him, while Skinner breaks up the medical procedure before the young woman is beheaded. Later, Mulder is at home when Scully tells him Father Joe has died. It happened at the same moment, Mulder notes, that Scully disconnected the life support to Tomczeszyn's severed head. Somehow, he surmises, the two men's fates were linked by more than just visions.

Yeh Mera India
 ''Yeh Mera India'' focuses on the comprehensive [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] of [[Mumbai]], with a special focus on the biases that permeate the corner of its society. Whether it is communal, social, economic, religious or educational biases, the "bias" factor dominates the entire depiction of the film, merging different characters into one story.  The different biases that are incorporated into the film are as following:  #Religious bias - A devout [[Muslim]] listens to the radical sermons of a religious leader that aims to instigate his followers to take revenge for the wrongdoings occurring within the Islamic community. This leads his followers to collaborate to create havoc in the city, but plans fail. However, when the plan is about to succeed, the follower decides to abort it, seeing a Hindu boy walk towards it. This child had previously helped a lost Muslim girl find her mother. #Communal bias - [[Rajpal Yadav]] is a [[Bihari people|Bihari]] who has just arrived in Mumbai, looking for work. In his quest for some money and food, Yadav encounters incredible bias against his community, with [[Marathi people|Marathis]] blaming his creed for taking away jobs and others ridiculing his sub-par technical skills. On the other side, a [[Brahmin]] politician opposes his son's courtship of a [[Dalit]] girl; however, he decides to exploit the relationship for political gain. #Social bias - [[Sarika]] is the administrator of a large hospital, running it with zeal and fervor. [[Seema Biswas]] is a poor woman who is trying to gather funds for her husband's bail money, as he has been framed in a fraudulent case. Biswas works at Sarika's house, cooking meals and cleaning the house. Despite Seema's honest work, Sarika continues to doubt her when things go missing, checking her purse and doubting her character. In the end, it is Biswas who comes to the aid of Sarika at a crucial moment. #[[Sexism|Gender bias]] - [[Sarika]]'s husband is a successful builder and owner of several [[Call Centre]] across Mumbai. Intoxicated with money and power, he finds himself unable to resist deflowering women, using every moment to lure women, by showering expensive gifts on them. However, a moment arrives where he finds himself on crossroads, unable to face the reality, but understanding its repercussions. #Economic bias - [[Perizaad Zorabian]] is a successful creative head of a [[Television channel|channel]]. However, work and life has tensed her. She is unable to bear the hectic pressure of Mumbai and asks her husband to find work in either the [[United States]] or [[United Kingdom]]. Perizaad looks for opportunities to insult people and finds her financial power too strong to succumb to emotion.  Biases of these sort weave the entire story into finding resolutions based on the biases of individuals and the reality of the lifestyle of Mumbai. The message clearly floated through movie is ''We have to learn to live together like Brothers or perish like Fools'', as said by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|M. Luther King]]. This movie plot has certain similarities with the plot of ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (2004), an American movie starring [[Matt Dillon]], [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Thandie Newton]] and [[Brendan Fraser]].<ref></ref>

You Don't Mess with the Zohan
    Zohan Dvir ([[Adam Sandler]]) is a [[superhuman]] Israeli counter-terrorist, but a barbecue he hosts is interrupted by the IDF sending him to stop a Palestinian terrorist group led by his personal arch-enemy, Fatoush "Phantom" Hakbarah ([[John Turturro]]), another superhuman. Seeing it as a long-awaited chance, he [[Pseudocide|fakes his own death]] during the pursuit and smuggles himself onto a plane to New York City, cuts his hair, and adopts the alias "Scrappy Coco".  Zohan's military expertise makes Michael ([[Nick Swardson]]) give him stay. However, Michael starts to lose comfort in Zohan when he finds him sleeping with his mother, Gail ([[Lainie Kazan]]). Zohan encounters a fellow Israeli named Oori ([[Ido Mosseri]]), who owns an electronics store, at a disco; he recognizes Zohan but vows to keep his identity a secret. Zohan attempts to gain a job, but Oori turns him down, informing him that several workers had dreams of their own, but got used to the lifestyle of the store, and Oori's reason to turn Zohan down is that he respects his dream too much to let Zohan kill his own dream, which Zohan commends him for. Oori takes him to an area in lower Manhattan populated with Middle Eastern immigrants, who are split between a [[Palestinian People|Palestinian]] side and an [[Israeli American|Israeli]] side of the street. Zohan is fearful at first, but after Oori informs him of Phantom's success (and following a memory of a mercenary cutting his hand off, but he telekinetically controls it and stabs the mercenary in the back, and drinking a Fizzy Bubblech drink afterwards), Zohan attempts to land a job in a struggling salon of a Palestinian woman named Dalia ([[Emmanuelle Chriqui]]). Dalia reluctantly allows Zohan to sweep floors for free, but after losing one of her employees (and an apparent attempt at [[suicide]]), she eventually allows him to be a stylist after he pleases a senior lady with an exceptional haircut and back room sexual service. Zohan's reputation spreads rapidly among the more elderly women of lower Manhattan, causing Dalia's business to prosper, which upsets Grant Walbridge ([[Michael Buffer]]), a corporate magnate who has been trying to buy out all the local tenants on the block so that he can build a rollercoaster mall.  Zohan is identified by a Palestinian cab driver named Salim ([[Rob Schneider]]), who bears a grudge against Zohan for having taken his goat away in Palestine long ago because Salim spat on him. Salim convinces his friends, Hamdi and Nasi, to help him kill Zohan, but after two failed attempts to contact another terrorist through a customer service line, and a failed bomb attempt (in which they confuse 12 boxes of [[Neosporin]] for [[nitroglycerine]], thanks to Salim mispronouncing the word), they are forced to contact Phantom. Salim attempts to blackmail Phantom, but he ends up getting the stiff end of the deal as he convinces Phantom to visit New York to find Zohan. Meanwhile, after Zohan takes Michael's shift for a community nightwatch and takes out a series of graffiti artists, which frustrates Walbridge even further, he realizes that he has fallen in love with Dalia and comes clean to Michael and his mother about his true identity (after learning of Phantom's visit, even though Michael had apparently figured that out already) before meeting Dalia. Dalia rejects Zohan after he reveals he was formerly an Israeli counterterrorist operative. Zohan decides to leave Dalia to protect her, though she gives him a [[John Paul Mitchell Systems|Paul Mitchell]] book as a leaving gift, and confront Phantom in a championship [[Hacky Sack]] game sponsored by Walbridge. After Phantom meets with [[Mariah Carey]], Zohan arrives and reluctantly begins to fight Phantom. Zohan's fight is cut short with sudden news of the Middle Eastern block being attacked, and he quickly leaves, shortly after discussing his plans with Michael and an undercover agent.  Zohan arrives and calms the Israelis and Palestinians, who each blame the other for the violence, while making peace with Salim. Phantom then appears and confronts Zohan, but Zohan refuses to fight. Dalia appears, revealing that she is Phantom's sister, and convinces her brother to cooperate with Zohan against the arsonists, revealed to be racist [[redneck (stereotype)|rednecks]] hired by Walbridge to instigate an interethnic riot so he can get his new mall in the aftermath. As Zohan and Phantom work to save the block (both by [[Chun-Li|kicking combat]], and by singing "The Sound", a sound so loud, it destroys many shop windows, blows the manhole cover, and even blows up the artificial breasts of Walbridge's girlfriend), Phantom admits that he always wanted to be a shoe salesman rather than a terrorist. Although the rednecks are defeated (with the lead one in a humiliating way) and Walbridge is jailed (since the methods he used were far from legal), Phantom continues singing "The Sound" and accidentally destroys all of the shops on the block. However, with the Israelis and Palestinians united (and rekindled, in the case of Zohan and Salim), the block is transformed into a collectively owned mall called the Peace and Brotherhood Fire Insurance Mall. Phantom opens a shoe shop in the mall called Fatoush's Kickin' Shoes (having stopped being embarrassed about his first name, and having apparently closed the muchentuchen restaurant chain), Oori reopens his "Going Out of Business" electronics shop, Salim gets back his goat, which he gives small children rides on next to a baby shop, and Zohan and Dalia open a beauty salon together called Dalohan (which is presumably their ship name), with Zohan having now married Dalia. In the end, Zohan's parents, initially unsupportive of his dream to be a hairdresser, show up, approving of his new job and lifestyle before his father requests that he cut his hair, which Zohan happily does.  
Yeti: Curse of the Snow Demon
 A college football team's plane crashes in the  [[Himalayan Mountains|Himalayas]]. The survivors, consisting of Sarah, Peyton, Raven, Ashley, Dennis, Kyra, Rice, Andrew, and Garcia, have only three energy bars for food. Finding a trail of blood, Garcia and Andrew find a cave that turns out to be the Yeti's lair. Garcia escapes, but the Yeti butchers Andrew. Soon afterward, Sarah sees one of the corpses being dragged away, but Peyton ignores her.  A search and rescue team, Fury and Sheppard, are sent to look for the crashed plane. At the camp Raven raises the possibility of eating the dead bodies and many of the survivors except a few agreed with him. Since one of the people who disagreed was the leader, the whole team decided not to eat the bodies.  The rescue team finds large footprints in the snow. At the camp, two survivors responsible for finding food return empty-handed and Raven sets out to cut up one of the bodies for food. The body which he is about the cut up happens to be Kyra's brother, who she loved very much and was very close to. She manages to stop him and the survivors realize another body is missing and accuse Raven of possibly hiding and eating it. The survivors decide they will eat one of the bodies if a rescue team does not arrive the next day.  After a day has passed, the survivors eat one of the bodies. Kyra, however, cannot stand the thought of eating one of the bodies and retreats back into the plane. Later that night, she sets all of the bodies on fire, rendering them inedible. An enraged Raven furiously accuses her of possibly killing them all and tries to turn everyone against her, but the others stick up for her, saying that she did the right thing, and decide to try and hike down the mountains the next morning. Garcia returns to the camp, but a terrified Raven shoots him in the face with a flare gun. Looking for food, the Yeti attacks the survivors, killing Ashley and Dennis. They shoot the Yeti with the remaining flare gun, but it escapes with Sarah. As the survivors consider going after her, the rescue team finds them. They decide to find Sarah.  Sarah awakes next to two slumbering Yetis. The team digs a hole at one of the entrances to the cave, filling it with punji stakes, and Sarah finds them. However, the Yetis wake up and give chase. The group manages to get out of the cave and the Yetis fall into the trap, trapping them. An avalanche ensues, sealing off the cave and killing one of the Yetis. After saying their goodbyes to the dead, the survivors hike for a while before setting up camp. One of the Yetis emerges from the avalanche and, though badly injured, pursues the survivors.  The next morning, the survivors start hiking again. Raven stops to "urinate" and eat some chocolate that he hid; the Yeti appears before him. The survivors run, but the Yeti catches Raven, biting off one of his ears. Fury attempts to save him, but accidentally shoots and kills him. The Yeti quickly kills her and Sheppard as the team run off. Peyton tackles the Yeti, they roll off a cliff, and though Peyton grabs hold of a branch, the Yeti holds on to his leg. The rest of the team rescues Peyton by spearing the Yeti, causing it to fall to its death, and a nearby chopper spots the four survivors and rescues them. Garcia wakes up to find himself alone in the snow, however, a Yeti arm punches through the snow and his eventual fate is left ambiguous.  
Yes Man (film)
 Bank loan officer Carl Allen ([[Jim Carrey]]) has become withdrawn since his divorce from his ex-wife Stephanie. He has an increasingly negative outlook on his life and routinely ignores his friends Pete ([[Bradley Cooper]]) and Rooney ([[Danny Masterson]]). An old colleague, Nick Lane ([[John Michael Higgins]]) suggests that he goes to a motivational "Yes!" seminar with him, which encourages its attendants to seize the opportunity to say "Yes!". Carl attends and meets inspirational guru Terrence Bundley ([[Terence Stamp]]). Bundley publicly forces a reluctant Carl to promise to answer "Yes!" to every opportunity, request, or invitation that presents itself.  Later, Carl says yes to a homeless man's request and is stranded in [[Elysian Park, Los Angeles|Elysian Park]]. Disillusioned, he hikes to a gas station where he meets Allison ([[Zooey Deschanel]]), an unorthodox young woman. She gives him a ride back to his car on her scooter and kisses him before leaving. After this positive experience, Carl feels more optimistic about saying yes. However, he refuses [[oral sex]] from his elderly neighbor Tillie ([[Fionnula Flanagan]]), and then falls down the stairs and is nearly attacked by a dog. Seeing the repercussions of saying no, he goes back to Tillie and to his surprise enjoys the moment.  Carl starts to seize every opportunity that comes his way. He renews his friendships with Pete and Rooney; builds a bond with his boss, Norman; assists Pete's fiancée, Lucy ([[Sasha Alexander]]), with her bridal shower; attends [[Korean language]] classes; and much more. He earns a corporate promotion at work and, making use of his guitar lessons, plays [[Third Eye Blind]]'s song "[[Jumper (song)|Jumper]]" to persuade a man not to commit suicide. Accepting a band flyer outside of a coffee shop, he sees an idiosyncratic band called [[Von Iva#Yes Man|Munchausen by Proxy]]; the lead singer is Allison. He is charmed by her quirkiness; she is charmed by his spontaneity and the two begin dating.  Carl and Allison meet at the airport for a spontaneous weekend excursion. Having decided to take the first plane out of town, regardless of its destination, they end up in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], where they bond more. Allison asks Carl to move in with her and he hesitantly agrees. While checking in for the return flight, Carl and Allison are detained by [[FBI]] agents who have profiled him as a potential terrorist because he has taken flying lessons, studied Korean, approved a loan to a fertilizer company, met an Iranian, and bought plane tickets at the last minute. Pete, his attorney, travels to Nebraska to explain Carl's odd habits, lessons, and decisions. As she finds out about Carl's motivational covenant, Allison begins to doubt whether his commitment to her was ever sincere. Deciding that she can no longer trust him, Allison leaves Carl and refuses to return his phone calls.  Carl's life takes a turn for the worse and he almost forgets about Lucy's shower. He manages to arrange a major surprise shower, set his friend Norm up with Soo-Mi ([[Vivian Bang]]), a Korean girl, and Rooney with Tillie. After the party, Carl receives a tearful phone call from Stephanie, whose new boyfriend has walked out on her. When Carl goes to Stephanie's apartment to comfort her, she kisses him and asks him to spend the night with her. After Carl emphatically says no, his luck takes a turn for the worse and he decides to end his commitment to the covenant.  Carl goes to the convention center and hides in the backseat of Terrence's convertible so that he can beg to be released from the covenant. Carl emerges as Terrence drives off, and an oncoming vehicle collides with Terrence, resulting in the two being taken to a hospital. After Carl recovers consciousness, Terrence tells Carl that the covenant was not real, but it was merely a starting point to open Carl's mind to other possibilities, not to permanently take away his ability to say no if he needed to. Freed from this restraint, Carl finds Allison teaching a sports-photography lesson and admits that he is not ready to move in with her just yet, but that he genuinely loves her, and they reconcile with a kiss as Allison's students take pictures.  
Yonkers Joe
 Joe ([[Chazz Palminteri|Palminteri]]) is a small-time con-man and dice-hustler who works with a group of men with similar interests. They shave cards and dice, doing small-time cons at card games and union picnics. He's in a long-term relationship with Janice ([[Christine Lahti|Lahti]]) and has a son with Down's syndrome, Joe Jr. ([[Tom Guiry|Guiry]]).  Joe finds out that his son must leave his residential care facility due to age. Joe Jr. has difficulty controlling his anger. He uses profanity and gets into fights. Thus, the residential facility is hesitant to recommend him to the group home for adults and Joe must take his son home, at least for a few weeks. Joe has been looking to make a bigger score, and he begins to hope that such a score could enable him to get his son into the group home. Sure that he could not care for his son, he begins work putting together a scam in Vegas.  During this time, the film shows that Joe's crew are affectionate towards Joe Jr., often more so than Joe himself. Joe Jr. also strikes up a friendship with Janice. When Stanley ([[Michael Lerner (actor)|Lerner]]) finds some men who will front Joe and the crew the cash, plans are laid for a trip to Vegas in the hope of scoring big. Tensions remain between Joe and Joe Jr., but they all travel to Vegas to find a way to hustle the casinos. While in Vegas, Joe Jr. gives a gift to Janice at the hotel room and then tries to force himself on her sexually. Joe comes in and pulls him off. All three are visibly shaken and Joe Jr. runs out of the hotel. At Janice's request, Joe catches up with him and brings him back. She forgives Joe Jr., but it becomes clear to her that they cannot handle him alone without professional help.  While watching someone else roll the dice in [[Craps]], Joe realizes that the cameras focus on the shooter. Using Joe Jr. as a partner, he demonstrates to Stanley and Janice that if he only rolls one die a partner across the table could drop a second weighted die in an almost unrecognizable move. Repeat the move and two weighted dice are on the table, enabling the crew to win big. Stanley originally agrees to drop the dice, but backs out because of fear that if he's caught he could lose his business. Joe Jr. offers to drop the dice and, after much reluctance, Joe agrees.  One by one they gather at a craps table in the casino. Joe Jr. comes up, drops the dice, but is asked to leave by a casino employee watching the table. As Joe Jr. walks out the door of the casino, the crew around the table begin to win with the weighted dice. Joe narrowly avoids being caught, and the crew succeeds in their score. However, after leaving the casino, Joe Jr. fails to show up at the meeting place. After a search, Joe finds Joe Jr. at a bus stop, ready to travel back to the residential facility. Joe Jr. explains that he has spoken to the manager and apologized for his past behavior. The facility has agreed to take Joe Jr. back until the group home is ready for him in six months. Joe at first resists, but eventually gives in and tearfully says goodbye to his son.  When returns to Janice he explains that Joe Jr. has "let him go."

Zack and Miri Make a Porno
 Zack Brown and Miri Linky are roommates in [[Monroeville, Pennsylvania]] (a [[Pittsburgh]] suburb). They have been friends since the first grade. Despite Miri working at the local shopping mall and Zack working at a coffee shop, they have not paid their utility bills in months, with Zack devoting much of his free time to a fanatic following of the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and his status in the community amateur hockey team, the Monroeville Zombies. After work on the night before Thanksgiving, their water gets turned off before they go to their [[high school reunion]].  At the reunion, Miri attempts to seduce her attractive former classmate Bobby Long, while Zack strikes up a conversation with Brandon St. Randy, who reveals that he is a [[Homosexual|gay]] [[porn star]], and Bobby's boyfriend. After returning home from the reunion, the apartment's electricity is turned off. Inspired by a successful [[viral video]] that was filmed by a pair of teenage boys as Miri changed in Zack's place of work for the reunion (revealing that she wore unattractive "granny panties" underwear), and emboldened by the cultural mainstreaming of [[Pornography|pornographic]] entertainment, Zack convinces a reluctant Miri that they should make a pornographic film to earn money.  Gathering a group of acquaintances and hired help as the cast and crew, they decide to film a pornographic ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[parody]], entitled ''Star Whores''. Delaney, the film's producer and Zack's co-worker, rents film equipment and a building to use as a studio. When they return to the studio after the first night of filming, the building is being demolished, with all the equipment and costumes inside. They are told that the man that rented it to them had run off with the money. Later at the coffee shop where Zack works, he realizes that his boss threatened to install a hidden camera, which Zack finds and decides to use to replace their lost film equipment. Zack retools his film to take place in the coffee shop, revamping the film to one with a coffee shop motif, ''Swallow My Cockuccino''. The group shoots the film after hours.  Despite their insistence that they would not let sex with each other affect their friendship, Zack and Miri soon develop romantic feelings for each other. When it comes time for Zack and Miri to have sex on camera, they find that instead of the clinical sex enacted by the actors in the other scenes, their interlude is romantic and heartfelt. Later the next evening, Zack and Miri are at home tentatively about to discuss their reactions to the scene, when suddenly their apartment's electricity and water service return. The rest of the actors and crew reveal that they pooled their resources to pay one month of Zack and Miri's bills and are throwing them an early wrap party.  At the party, one of the other actresses, Stacey, asks Miri if it's okay for her to ask Zack to have sex, since she's nervous about her upcoming scene with him. Although Miri has realized that she has developed feelings for Zack, she tells Stacey it's okay to ask him. When Stacey relates this to Zack, the two retreat to Zack's bedroom, much to Miri's dismay.  The next evening, Zack is preparing to film a scene between Stacey and another actor, Lester, that was supposed to have been with Lester and Miri. Zack is dismayed when Miri shows up and insists on shooting the scene as originally planned. In the back room, an incredulous Zack asks if she is doing this as a form of retaliation, pointing out that Stacey told him that Miri did not mind her sleeping with Zack. Miri corrects him, clarifying that she did not mind that Stacey merely made the ''offer'' to sleep with him. Perceiving this to have been some type of test, Zack admits that during the sex scene they filmed together, they were actually making love and that there was an emotional connection between them, and that he loves Miri. When Miri does not reciprocate, Zack storms out of the coffee shop, quitting the film and his job, and moves out of the apartment.  Three months later, Delaney goes to see Zack, who has moved on to an exterior concessions job at [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Mellon Arena]] during [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] games. Delaney convinces him to come to Delaney's home to see the unfinished film and help complete it. Zack agrees, and as Delaney and the cameraman Deacon explain, Zack learns that Miri never filmed her sex scene with Lester. Zack goes to Miri's apartment and reveals to her that he never slept with Stacey; instead, they talked about Miri all night. He pours his heart out to Miri, proclaiming his love for her, which she reciprocates.  In a post credits scene, it is revealed that Zack and Miri have married, and with the help of Delaney and his worker's compensation settlement, start their own [[video production]] company, ''Zack and Miri Make Your Porno'', which makes amateur videos for couples.  
Your Whole Life Ahead of You
 The events of a freshly graduated young woman in the universe of precarious work.  
Zift
 ''Zift'''s plot unfolds non-linearly: although the main story after Moth's release from prison is told chronologically, the events leading to his imprisonment are revealed by means of numerous relatively long and not necessarily chronological [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s. The story is presented chronologically here.  Moth is an ordinary guy from Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. At school, he falls in love with the beautiful Ada ([[Tanya Ilieva]]), later nicknamed "Mantis". Out of a desire for money, he agrees to work for a shady neighbour known as Slug ([[Vladimir Penev]]). The two plot the theft of a [[Carbonado|black diamond]] from the [[white émigré]] [[jeweller]] Vlad the Bijou's house. The robbery ends in failure as Moth is wounded by The Bijou and captured by the police; Slug manages to escape and is never charged. There is no trace of the [[diamond]], and as Vlad is killed by Slug during the robbery, the police never get to know of its existence.  In the Sofia prison, Moth, besides working out to patriotic [[Soviet music]], also befriends his older roommate Van Wurst the Eye ([[Mihail Mutafov]]), so nicknamed because he has been wearing an [[ocular prosthesis]] after losing one of his eyes during a robbery in [[Barcelona]]. Besides being an avid [[boxing|boxer]] and [[arm wrestling|arm wrestler]], Van Wurst also has his [[philosophy|philosophical]] views on life, such as a theory about the destructive power of [[women]], which he shares with Moth. Shortly before being released, Van Wurst [[hanging|hangs himself]], claiming "there is no hope outside". While in prison, Moth is informed by Ada that his son Leonid was born and died of lockjaw while still very young.  As Moth is released from prison afterwards, he picks up his civil clothes and his year-old ball of chewing bitumen from the cloakroom and does not miss the chance to swear at an obnoxious guard, who [[headbutt]]s him to unconsciousness. Outside, Moth is picked by a warrant officer and a younger soldier who drive him in a [[Chaika (car)|Chaika]] to [[Sofia Public Mineral Baths|the Baths]]. In the damp basement of the Baths, he is interrogated and tortured by Slug, now a locally influential member of the communist ''[[nomenklatura]]'', who believes Moth knows the location of the black diamond. Moth denies and even doubts the diamond ever existed; he later manages to escape, but not before he consumes [[iridium]]-poisoned wine offered to him by Slug.  Wandering drunk and intoxicated around Sofia and seeking his old girlfriend Ada, Moth gets to witness the new socialist reality he had only heard about on the prison radio: the look of the city has changed with [[Largo, Sofia|The Largo]] and the [[Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum]], but the nature of the people has remained essentially the same. The protagonist meets a variety of bizarre characters, such as drug-doing medics, weird patients and local drunks. He ends up in the Saint Nicholas Church, where he meets the priest who had baptized him ([[Đoko Rosić]]); the priest points him to Ada's current whereabouts as a performer in a [[nightclub]] under the [[stage name]] Gilda (a reference to ''[[Gilda]]'', as Ada also performs a Bulgarian-language version of ''Put the Blame on Mame'').<ref></ref>  Moth finds Ada, who is now living with Slug, and has [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with her. He later reveals to Ada that he is aware of the diamond's location: in Vlad the Bijou's [[coffin]]. The two go to the graveyard, where Moth first insists to visit the grave of his son. However, he realizes that it is another Leonid's grave (his mother had been buried in the same grave very recently) and that he never actually had a son. At the same time he notices Slug standing behind him with Ada, who had apparently betrayed him. The three head to The Bijou's grave; while digging, Moth kills Slug with his [[pickaxe]], but is fatally wounded and stunned by Ada a moment later.  Moth wakes up in the gravediggers' shed. Realizing his impending death, he asks for his bitumen in order not to die with a foul breath. Tearing the bitumen apart, Moth reveals the black diamond had been stashed within it for all those years. He swallows the diamond and dies.<ref name=quietearth/><ref name=evestnik/>

Your Name Here
  During the summer of 1974, science-fiction writer William J. Frick ([[Bill Pullman]]) is having a meltdown. Despite having numerous popular titles to his credit, Frick is penniless.

Zombie Strippers
 The film opens with a news montage explaining that it is set in a [[Dystopian|dystopic]] near-future in which [[George W. Bush]] has been elected to a fourth term. The [[United States Congress]] has been disbanded; public nudity is banned; the United States is embroiled in wars with [[France]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[Syria]], [[Venezuela]], [[Canada]], and [[Alaska]]. Due to there not being enough soldiers to fight in all the wars, a secret laboratory run by Dr. Chushfeld in fictional Sartre, Nebraska, has developed a virus to re-animate dead Marines and send them back into battle. However, this virus has broken containment and infected test subjects and scientists, and they are at risk of escaping from the lab. A team of Marines code-named the "Z" Squad is sent in to destroy the zombies. One of the Marines named Byrdflough (Zak Kilberg) is bitten but escapes. He ends up in an alley outside an underground [[strip club]] named "Rhino". The Marine dies and awakens as a zombie who goes into the strip club.  "Rhino" is run by Ian Essko. A new stripper named Jessy has arrived at the club to save up enough money for her grandmother's operation. She is introduced to the club's star dancer, Kat. Kat begins her dance on the stage, but is attacked by Byrdflough. Essko is concerned about losing his best dancer, so he lets her go back on stage as a zombie. To everyone's surprise, Kat is a better and more popular dancer as a zombie than she was as a human.  The other strippers now find themselves faced with the prospect of losing their customers, as the customers prefer zombie strippers to human strippers. One by one, the human strippers become zombies, some by choice in order to compete or (in the case of [[Gothic rock]] stripper, Lillith) for fun. During private dances, the zombie strippers bite and kill their customers. Essko tries to keep the zombies hidden in a cage in the club's cellar, but eventually, the zombies escape and overrun the club. Kat and the underrated stripper Jeannie fight for supremacy. The remaining humans in the club struggle to survive until the "Z" Squad burst in to destroy the zombies. But they discover that the zombies were allowed to escape by the Bush Administration, in the hopes that the ensuing zombie plague would distract Americans from their gross mishandling of the war effort and the economy.  
Zombies! Zombies! Zombies!
 Searching for the cure for cancer, a scientist creates a chemical that promotes cell growth. After being visited by a drug addict, the drugs and the cure are mixed up and misused by him and several prostitutes. They become zombified and begin biting people nearby. A small group of exotic dancers team up with the prostitutes' former pimp to defend their strip club, the Grindhouse, against a horde of blood-thirsty zombies.  Four strippers in a nightclub, after their dance routines are over and the club is closing for the night, walk over to a nearby cafeteria for breakfast, when some hookers turn into zombies and attack them. Except for one stripper Pandora, played by Juliet Reeves, who couldn't make it till the end, the other 3 ladies manage to fight and decimate all the zombies and survive through it all.  The prettiest and tallest of the 3 surviving strippers is Dakota, played by Playboy playmate [[Jessica Barton]]. She is the most popular (and most tipped) stripper of the club, but that comes with quite some attitude. During the course of the movie, she gives a lap dance to one of her lovers, but then he gets bitten and turns into a zombie. Dakota has to blow this lover-turned-zombie (as well as her boyfriend cop-turned-zombie) with her gun.  The second stripper is Dallas, played by Miss Oahu Lyanna Tumaneng. She is clearly the most courageous of the trio, as she braved zombie attacks to get the zombie antidote from the laboratory. The male lead Chris, played by Sean Harriman, was on the same mission alongside Dallas and managed to inject himself with the zombie antidote that they found in the lab. Eventually, Chris falls in love with her.  The third stripper is Chris' sister Harley, played by Playboy playmate Hollie Winnard. She is a single mom of a little daughter and they stay with Chris and their grandmother. This was Harley's very first night at the club, where she plays a nervous rookie and she performs a quick but funny tease.  During the beginning of the film the strippers have a difficult time identifying themselves to each other. They awkwardly introduce each other by their stage name, and their real names. Their indecisiveness in their career lead to differences in how strippers should be treated by themselves, others, and of course zombies.  As the battle between the zombies and the remaining survivors heats up, the zombies start to get the upper hand. Though the survivors are locked inside a safe room, the buxom hooker-turned-zombie named Pamela, as played by Stephanie Miller, manages to get inside. In the skirmish, Chris loses to her strength, as Pamela bites him and takes a chunk off his forehead. But thanks to the zombie antidote in his blood, Pamela is soon blown to smithereens. Harley and Dakota do not understand what happened, so Dallas explains that exposing Chris' blood to the zombies is a sure way to destroy them all. To test the idea, Chris offers his right hand to a zombie outside the door, and upon biting Chris, that zombie is blown apart as well.  Seeing the plan work so well, Dakota suggests that they should let 2 zombies into the room. The plan works well for the first couple of times, as 2 zombies are let into the room at a time, and after biting the shoulders of Chris, they are blown apart. But soon, a very weakened Chris collapses on the floor. Hell breaks loose, as all the remaining zombies manage to break into the room and attack them. With no other option to save the 3 girls, Chris gets up for his final action. He requests his sister Harley to take care of her daughter Jenna, whom Chris used to babysit back at home. He then gives a farewell kiss to his love interest Dallas. Chris offers himself to the pack of zombies, with the girls making no effort at all to stop him from doing so. At the outset, the zombies cut through Chris' ribs and eat up his heart, as the girls look on. Within a very short time, the zombies finish him off and then blow themselves apart as expected. The devouring of Chris by the zombies happens at a pretty high speed, instead of his arms, legs, torso, etc. being chomped step-by-step. Finally, all that is left of Chris are just some blood and flesh splattered on the club floor, along with that of the exploded zombies.  With all zombies finally eliminated, the 3 girls wipe the goo off their hair and walk out of the nightclub in supermodel catwalk style, smiles of victory writ large on their face. Their outfits are still smeared with flesh and blood of zombies and Chris alike. Out in the open daylight, Dallas smilingly comments to Harley that they had a rough last night. Harley replies that it wasn't as much fun as she had hoped.
